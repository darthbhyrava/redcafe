I believe that Rooney will have a very strong season next season. He's not had a consistent season for a couple of years now IMO, but he looks in great shape and will be working under a top manager. For all of Moyes' flaws under us, he was key at motivating Rooney, though I'm not an avid believer in allowing players that much freedom. Rooney obviously felt undervalued under Fergie, but that shouldn't be used as an excuse for his poor performances. However, he's a great player mentally and at the top in that regard. For example, his role for us in the second half of 12/13 is often overlooked.

I find it sad that many on here want him to fail and have made the assumption that he won't get on well with LvG. I also find it frustrating that there's no balance in opinions. It's rare to find a balanced opinion on Rooney, unsurprisingly.

I'm no fan of Rooney as a #10 - I think his first touch, close control, awareness, positioning, and passing aren't good enough in that role, but there's nothing definitive with regards to LvG's choice of system. We'll see how well he does soon.

2~~~
Also, he got one of our keepers to score an OG from a corner kick, he's bound to be brilliant.

3~~~
Gives good hug

4~~~
He'll have a good season. Most assists in the league, I feel.

5~~~
High five skills are much more important.

6~~~
He's a key player for us. A lot of people were judging two people who had never met before, and yet here we are seeing them getting along. I reckon Van Gaal will have a good plan and role for him.

7~~~
I expect Wayne to prove the doubters wrong. He looked fighting fit at the WC.

8~~~
He needs to maintain match fitness and sharpness throughout the year, even if/when he gets injured. Can't have him being a passenger when coming back from a layoff, that seems to always be the case

9~~~
I hope he stays fit and has a great season.

I also hope he doesn't get the captaincy.

10~~~
I think he will. 10 years at the club, english, one of the top performers, add the fact that there's no real standout canditate since Vidic & Evra left I think he's nailed on it.

11~~~
Asking to leave twice trumps everything else for me.

If he plays as he capable of then I'm glad we've got him, but I don't want him captaining the club.

12~~~
He'll have a top season, maybe even one of his best...He has to!

13~~~
Yeh, I can understand that. Evans would be my second choice, only if he can pinpoint a starting spot though, don't want Carrick or Van Persie.

14~~~
It's a shame that we don't have anyone in the squad now that seems to hold the same level of love for the club that Evra had.

15~~~
Me neither. It's a shame that nobody really jumps out any more. Not for wearing the armband itself, but for what it represents.

16~~~
Fergie said of Bryan Robson that his drinking only became a problem when he was injured, because he wasn't sweating out the alcohol like he normally did with his intense training.

Replace booze with junk food and fags and I think Rooney has (had?) the same problem.

17~~~
Noticed the original poster said "next season"... Seeing as the first friendly is today, can we now call it "this season"?

18~~~
Yes.

19~~~
I believe for Rooney to have a good season, either Mata or Van Persie must have a bad/average one. I can not see Rooney having a good season unless he is played in a proficient role and is surrounded by players that would improve his overall efficiency. All in all, I would be surprised if all three of these players has an excellent season this campaign without considering how injuries will affect team selection.

20~~~
I think Van Gaal will surprise you. If anyone in the world can get all three playing well in one system it's him.

21~~~
Rooney is one of the stronger options for captain because you still want him in the team playing regularly. Yes he can be poor every now and then, and sometimes he can be downright frustrating. But when he's on form, my god...

22~~~
I hope he will. I believe instead of Rooney being sacrifice to play on the left, Van Gaal may push Mata out wide and play Rooney behind the main striker/alongside when everone is fit. Mata is at least playable out wide, whereas Rooney on the left is hard to watch. I am sort of against this idea as I believe Mata is the best no. 10 in the league, so it will be a waste to have him out wide. 

The system Van Gaal will play to incoprate these players will be an interesting thing to note throughout the season. I do not know how we can have a balance side with all three playing, but hopefully Van Gaal will figure it out. In the 5-3-2, there is no need for an extra center back in bpl competition, moreover the three in front will lack pace and penetration. The 4-2-2-2 seems like the best scenario, but Van Persie and Rooney must complement each otherin this duel striking role. Which, last season it has been noted, Rooney would prefer to pass it out wide than to his partner down the middle. Moreover, he would sometime get in Rvp space without providing the penetrative runs. Nevertheless, that was last season and things do change. So, their is a possibility that they can complement each other in the upcoming campaign.

23~~~
He is always one of our best players every year and it won't be any different this season..

I might not be a fan but he is good at what he does..Dont think he was as much of a team player last season and if LVG gets him to start understanding what a leadership role means, he will be exciting to watch.

24~~~
I've been very critical of Rooney in the past, and admittedly still resent him for his contract dispute, but I'd be very happy if Van Gaal gets the best out of him and the club benefits from it.

25~~~
Why the new thread? I thought the old thread kept going and just got renamed.

26~~~
I think all of ur strikers will have a good year if they are getting through balls like that?

27~~~
No, moving away from mega-threads. Makes sense to have it as a separate thread now.

28~~~
What really annoys me about Rooney is that he wants to come get the ball too often, if you wanna play as a striker please play like a striker.

29~~~
Ha no kidding.

30~~~
I don't think that's a problem if his strike partner runs in behind, which is why Rooney and Welbeck compliment each other very well, in my opinion.

31~~~
Yeah, but when he plays with RVP that is their biggest problem, they both do that. I have no idea why RVP has stopped making runs behind the defense as well.

32~~~
Well that means one should get dropped, and I personally feel Rooney is better at dropping off and linking up play.

33~~~
Indeed!

34~~~
Felt his and welbeck's off the ball movement was poor in the first half and they didn't give the midfielders any chance to play them the ball in behind the defence. They could all learn from young I suppose. He needs to revert back to his movement in the seasons when he was scoring all those goals. He's working way harder now to get goals than he was back then and that's down to him and how he's moving. He looks in good condition and there's no doubt his 1 touch play will get back to the level it used to be with van gaal in charge. You get the feeling our forwards aren't particularly sure where the goals are supposed to come from.

35~~~
Thought he was poor last night, but he's only training for 3 days so it's understandable.

36~~~
He will hopefully be sticking to one position more often under van Gaal. He wont want Rooney wasting all his energy making pointless runs back into his own penalty box or trying to be a playmaker in midfield.

37~~~
One burning question.

Why was he wearing a long sleeved top under his shirt?

38~~~
Doesn't he usually do that?

39~~~
In England maybe - but this was L.A.  Slightly warmer there.

40~~~
I think its a cooling undershirt.  Something like this <a class="externalLink" href="http://store.nike.com/gb/en_gb/pd/pro-combat-lightweight-seamless-long-sleeve-shirt/pid-871949/pgid-871947" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://store.nike.com/gb/en_gb/pd/p...less-long-sleeve-shirt/pid-871949/pgid-871947</a>.

His freckly Irish arms would be sunburnt to bits if they were exposed to the sun.

Unimpressive for half an hour or so, then bang. Magnificent goal. Then kaboom, phantasmagoric assist. Then kishpow, MUTV stream died. But legends say, he scored a penalty.

46~~~
A fully fit and confident Rooney going into the new season would be a great thing

I hope he gets the armband

47~~~
Mrs Smoker, the penalty is no myth.

48~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

49~~~
Mata and Rooney linkup there didn't look half bad, did it? Now have those two and RvP all clicking together and we should be having a very interesting season indeed.

50~~~
Kevin's devastated though. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

51~~~
But..but was it a 300k/week performance though? I think it was more of a 225k/week performance. Sell him!

52~~~
Didn't you get the memo, bro? Apparently, his relationship with LvG is falling apart aaaaany day now and he'll be gone by the end of the window. Which is just as well, 'cause he's actually quite shit 'n all.

53~~~
..and the greedy bastard does that in 45 min when we pay him for 90 min! <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

54~~~
Are there still people that think he can't shoot like he used to?

What was he doing picking up the ball from the centre back anyway? Blatant disregard for his role in the team. He's a striker who clearly doesn't have the vision or passing to create from open play, he should just stick to his own zone...

55~~~
Agree.
Who cares about his goals when he mis-controlled a ball at the ninth minute giving the same dullards to make a joke about his wage.

56~~~
Notwatching the game but he was getting dogs abuse whilst it was still 0-0 in the matchday forum.

Scored 2. Assisted 1.

57~~~
Lets be honest, he should be the captain.

58~~~
Not the best performance, (everyone's been sloppy, to be fair) but 2 world class moments from Rooney put us 2 ahead. Great goal and great assist.

59~~~
There are people on here who think he's incapable of chewing gum.

60~~~
Not his best of game, but he is on such wage because he is capable of producing those magical moment out of nothing.

61~~~
Playing really well so far. Long may it continue..

62~~~
He's always going to be under the most scrutiny and get twice as much abuse as anyone else on the squad. There are loads of little girls on this forum (apologies to the actual women on here) who can't get over the fact that the Rooney fairy tale, the one where he loved this club with all his heart and loved all the supporters as much as they him, simply wasn't true. I'm not sussed, because I know he's solely here to do a job and play his guts out.

The days of homegrown talent and badge kissing meaning anything are pretty much dead and gone. Almost all the signs of affection and love shown by the players towards the club and supporters, run about as deep as the next contract. Players are groomed by their "people" to say all the right things and act like the club they're with is the end all be all.

Some, like myself, who are old enough to not hero worship athletes and also understand how cynical the world of professional sports really can be, understand all this. I'm fine with a player not truly feeling the love I feel for this club, so long as they leave everything on the pitch and work their ass off.

I have no issues with Rooney the player, and I've no time to care about Rooney the man.

63~~~
He has my vote.

64~~~
*applause*

65~~~
We just have to accept his flaws now, sometimes his touch is going to be erratic and he will have spells where nothing he tries comes off but his end product and his statistics are outstanding and he's one of the few players we have who can produce moments of individual magic. The system Van Gaal wants to play should help him too, there are 3 rather than 2 places in the team where Rooney can play in a central, offensive role where he wants to play.

66~~~
Well said. Strong finish, which seems apt on a night like this.

67~~~
Oh look at that: Our best player seems to be feeling it early in the campaign..  Time for Wayne to play a world-class season,,

68~~~
Agree. Funny enough many supporters are okay with Ronaldo who actually left.

I also respect Rooney because while he may not love United, but he certainly respects the club. I mean he was playing out of position a lot of times in 12-13 and last year. He does not like it, but do it anyway. And when this conflict with Fergie over position or starting place took place Wayne did eveything asked of him, including playing as a CM against Stoke for example until United secured the league title. Only after that he told Fergie he wants to leave ot told him he wants to leave if he is not considered as a top player or whatever it was.

69~~~
Well said.  Perhaps a bit cynical, but can't disagree with anything here.  I think those who were thinking that Rooney would have a tough time playing for LVG are in for a surprise.

70~~~
He had a cracking game today. Brilliant first goal, brilliant long ball to Mata's goal and a brilliant penalty IMO

71~~~
Wasn't sure at first how he'd fit into van Gaal's style, obviously thought van gaal would like him as he's a fantastic player with an excellent work rate, but at first I'm sure we all assumed we'd play with a lone striker. In a 3-5-2 though I have a feeling he'll be brilliant this season, maybe even have his best season to date. He's not a midfielder, he's not a winger, and even though he can play as a #10, he's not that. He's a striker, always has been, and his best and most consistent seasons came as one. Playing consistently up there, next to van Persie and in front of Mata, well I think the three of them will be deadly.

72~~~
Rooney playing as an actual striker next year with mata behind him... hes going to get a feckton of goals and assists.

73~~~
Early days under LVG but Rooney looks like he's gonna thrive under his management. We should be grateful he's still around. Last season made his importance painfully clear. 

We don't have enough special players in our squad to produce goals and assists as regularly as he does. He's looking very fit and determined to prove himself once again. He's made for our captaincy whether people like it or not.

74~~~
Off to a good start, both in performances and seemingly in relationship with the manager. Looking forward to a good season from Wayne. I really dislike him playing no.10 as his game there is mainly just to spread it wide at every opportunity. Much better as an out and out striker and good to see LVG agrees.

75~~~
How did you come to this conclusion? What about Fletcher and Welbeck? Evans also. Rafael...

76~~~
Do the goals in preseason count towards his total count for club? On US TV they seem to be counting them and for some reason I thought they didn't. If they do then just 31 more to catch Sir Bobby.

77~~~
No they don't.. No idea why they would count them on tv. He's 33 away though, could potentially get there this season but unlikely without Champions League football. By the end of next season he should have the record.

78~~~
LVG emphasises on shooting practices in the training sessions and rooney should benefit from this. he seems to be inconsistent with his long range shooting these days despite occasional wonder goals,.

79~~~
^ Wonder how he's scored more goals from outside the box than anyone in recent years in the prem then

80~~~
Yep. And a lesson for Roy Hodgson and england supporters everywhere. Rooney is, was, and will be for the next few years, by a long way Englands best striker. He isnt 'shit' and daniel fecking sturridge is not better than him. Playing Rooney out left to have that chump as center forward was as daft a decision as I have ever seen at international level, including thinking lampard/gerrard was better than having Paul Scholes in the middle of the pitch..

81~~~
Word ho

82~~~
Van Gaal is revitalising Rooney. If you don't give Rooney a clearly defined role he tends to make one up for himself, which can be disruptive to a team's tactical shape. Van Gaal has a clear role for every player in the squad and Rooney is really benefiting from that. Rooney knows where he should be and when, he knows where he should be using his energy and when he shouldn't, he knows when to drop in when Mata goes forward and when to stay up when Mata is deep. There's a clarity to Rooney's game that you don't get when managers simply indulge him and let him go walkies. 2014/15 could end up being the first time we've seen the real Wayne Rooney pretty much since the Arsenal 8-2 in 2011/2012.

83~~~
Fantastic performance from him in the first half. Whole team was lagging behind untill his goal basically, it really helped us unlock Roma. Easily MOTM for yesterday.

84~~~
That's hard to pull off in FIFA much less reality!

85~~~
Thought he was poor in the first game, but did really good yesterday. His goal and assist were excellent. 

He's gonna have a great season.

86~~~
This was typical Rooney, starts the game poorly but changes everything after he scores that first goal and ends up with a brace by the end of the game. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> I think as a striker we'll see a lot of consistency from him, much more than playing his number 10 role.

87~~~
Anybody thinks that Rooney-Welbeck pairing has more fluidity than any other striker combination we have? I would not want RvP on bench because just like Rooney, he too can create something out of nothing but probably the setup will be different with Rooney-RvP pairing than we are seeing with Rooney-Welbeck. Welbeck tracks back more. RvP might stay further forward and draw defenders with him with his movements and allow Rooney and Mata more space behind him.

88~~~
That first goal was a stupendous hit. How does he get that much power into the shot when he's almost hitting it behind him??

89~~~
That's what everyone was saying at the beginning of 2011-12, and now I regret not giving Berbatov and Hernandez more minutes that season. Aside from that strike vs Galaxy, I still don't think Danny is clinical enough in general right. Although you are right about fluidity, and if Robin and Wayne start together, I think Wayne would have to do a lot of running to free up space for Robin and Mata to run into.

90~~~
I saiid all along Rooney under lvg would either go spectacularly wrong or spectacularly right, no middle ground, and the early signs are very promising. The link ups with mata look exciting. Given how he was one of few players to show any drive passion and fight last year, and this years promising start I'm warming to the little git. Exciting season ahead and he could very well be a massive part of it

91~~~
Good post.

92~~~
Ya, Welbeck's finishing really holds him back. Funnily, he seems to score difficult goals and miss the simple ones.

93~~~
He's the ultimate Roy of the Rovers most games. He does things that can infuriate at times, and then he just bangs One in the top corner. Exquisite goal last night.

94~~~
This his going to be one of his best ever seasons, finally he will be able to play a whole year as a striker and not a lone one. Really looking forward to it.

95~~~
Not much wrong with this. But some people have issues with Rooney the player, and similarly don't care about the man either.

96~~~
I think it's because his brain is the problem. When he finishes instinctively, he can do wonderful things. Rockets and curlers from range, dinks over the keeper, back-heel flicks... the list goes on. But when he has time to actually think about what he's going to do, which is often the case with 'easier' chances, the result is often indecisive or unconvincing.

97~~~
I love how Rooney can be having a bad game and then explode into life, such a valuable player to have in any team.

If i was the manager i'd see Rooney as United's Plan B or a plan-within-the-main-plan. Players like Shinji/Mata are great for the team and the manager can work on tactics and game plans all day with those guys. But when it isn't working you need something different and Rooney has always had that game changing ability.

Just my random thought on Rooney.

98~~~
It's this sort of impartiality that I wish more football fans have towards football players. What Rooney does in his personal life has no relevance to us, and as a footballer, he's better than what many make him out to be.

99~~~
Play him every game in a two man strike force with Mata and Herrera supplying the ammo and he'll score thirty and assist 20 next season. As I suspected LVG loves him and will challenge him to be the best he can be.

100~~~
Yup. Him up front with RVP with Herrera and Mata supplying the balls he will have a great season. It puts him into a perfect position to succeed.

101~~~
Anyone got a gif of the pass Rooney made to Mata? Those are the type of balls he should be getting. Super finish by Mata, by the way.

102~~~
If he will play as out and out striker, he will not deliver these great passes like the one for Mata's goal. In a LVG scheme he is playing in exactly the number 10 role, with license to attack and be in the box but also with a license to drop back allowing Mata and Welbeck occupy the CF spot and involving himself in attacking built-up.

Falcao is out and out striker. Or Chicarito. Wayne with a huge number of assists is wasted as a clear CF. He needs to be forward, sure. But a creative forward. The one that also involved in creating chances for other.

103~~~

104~~~
I'm not saying that all those who have issues with Rooney the player are being influenced by their hatred of Rooney the man, but almost exclusively, those that have issues with Rooney the player, are being influenced by their hatred of Rooney the man. 

He may not be the player that some people thought (assumed) he was going to be, and he definitely has had moments of poor form (there isn't hardly a player alive who doesn't), but he's about a season and a half from becoming the all-time leading scorer here. Considering some of the legends and greats that have laced up their boots for us, and also considering that Rooney has predominantly <i>not </i>played as an out-and-out striker for us, I'd call that a pretty significant argument for thinking he's been a top player for us. That, and the fact that his class is painfully obvious.

Even if you can't stand the thought of him being here, you should also be able to recognize that he's a special kind of player, capable of moments of complete brilliance that not many players would even attempt, let alone pull off.

105~~~
Thanks, <a class="username" data-user="61812, @Mrs Smoker" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/61812/">@Mrs Smoker</a>.

106~~~
I like Rooney. I think he has been poorly advised under Paul Stretford. Stretford may have got him to 300k a week but his legacy at the club in which he will become a hall of famer is tarnished. You've got to take into account what goes on behind the scenes. We all know he's not the most intelligent chap and his agent and people around him are very manipulative when it comes to money.
It's a shame that it has turned out this way because Rooney will become the clubs highest goalscorer and inevitably, one way or another will be a club legend. No one apart from Rooney himself can determine how much 'love' he has for the club. All we know is that he plays his heart out and can be unplayable at times. He is very very valuable to United. I've nothing but admiration for the club who did all they could to keep him with us.

107~~~
Meh. I place very little significance to those kinds of records because they are affected by many different things. That said, I think Rooney has issues, as a player. Don't necessarily want the guy sold, but I wouldn't exactly be too bothered if it happened either.

108~~~
My only issues with him are the fact that he can have a period where his first touch is horrible. Infact, even yesterday for about 20 mins his touch was very hit and miss.

109~~~
As I always say , if we didn't have him you would want him.

110~~~
What does he have to do next season for public opinion to swing back to his favour?

Apart from his contract issues which have been discussed to death, and the fact he never became the worlds best player, what do people have against him? he's allways given absolutely everything on the pitch and for me his is a genuinely world class player who is rated far higher in foreign countries than he is in england.

111~~~
It's not going to happen. The majority of United fans on this forum have made their mind up - Rooney is shite and is a hindrance more than a help. He could score 40 goals and get 40 assists and there will be people here complaining about his poor first touch in the 10th minute Sunderland or a misplaced pass in the 20th minute. The negatives will be magnified and positive aspects buried beneath it. Pretty much how it's been for 2 seasons now.

112~~~
Can't agree with this. If you've played any professional sport you'll know: 90% of what goes into winning, happens way before kickoff. Rooney is a terrible professional: he's usually unfit, overweight and doesn't really put in effort in the gym. This is why he ends up needing weeks/months to get to fitness, then has a spurt of goals which either dies down or he gets injured and comes back in bad condition again, repeating the cycle.

So for me it would be really simple: come in fit, motivated and raring to go.

113~~~
I don't remember him looking as fit in preseason as he is this season. He usually seems to need preseason games to get into shape. Looks to me like he has been a bit more dedicated this time (and of course the World Cup helped in that regard).

114~~~
That is the Jekyll and Hyde of the man, the he produces a fantastic pass and finish to change the game. He will never be that textbook player who gives you a perfect 90 minutes but he has the ability to change a game in a second that is invaluable at the highest level. He's looking trimmer to me and under I new manager who he can respect and will demand the most of him I expect him to have a good season.

115~~~
You've seen first hand, have you? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

116~~~
Since last summer, I haven't seen him look unfit. In fact he was doing extra training before the world cup.
He doesn't even look overweight at the start of preseason these days either.

117~~~
He definitely isn't unfit, but he is not as dynamic as he once was. The only thing that frustrates me with him now is his inconsistent first touch, but he has started the pre season well.

118~~~
I love that Van Gaal seem to want to play Rooney up-top, as a 9 next to Welbeck (and probably RVP when he returns).

No fecking about with Rooney, play him as a striker and he'll score goals.  We have Mata etc to do the no.10 work.

119~~~
And my sword! 
Yeah I agree with that. He'll be lethal as a #9 for a whole season, hope he plays there.

120~~~
Rooney upfront is like the Return of The King too. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

121~~~
Don't say that too loud, you're going to get lambasted!

122~~~
I agree <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

123~~~
great post

124~~~
I'm starting to go the other way and think that if Hernandez is staying, we should loan Welbeck out for a year where he can be the main man and get a year of experience leading an attack and hopefully improving his finishing.

125~~~
Welbeck is past the age of loan now. Especially after being around with senior squad for so long and already doing loan spells. He has to improve his finishing here only.

126~~~
Had Rooney been the scoring focal point for the majority of his career, I'd maybe put just a little less significance into the goal record accomplishment, but I'd also be splitting hairs. Also, It's kind of a <i>pretty important</i> milestone at a club of this standing and pedigree, considering the players that have played for us over the years.

You can't have a serious conversation about Rooney and at the same time ignore, gloss over, or just play down the effort and consistent production that he's turned out, year after year. The fact that Rooney's on the cusp of becoming our all time goal scorer having played as many if not more games shunted about the pitch, in order to fulfill a role, is pretty significant.


That statement right there is complete nonsense and utter fabrication.  If he was any one of those things, he'd have been shown the door, just as any number of other great players here have once they started to not produce, or just like any other number who felt they didn't have to put in the effort. There's are reasons Fergie kept him here, twice, in spite of the ease it would have took to unload him. Reasons that are the exact opposite of the nonsense you spouted in that post.

It isn't some blind favouritism that's somehow allowed him to keep his place here for as long as he has. He didn't pull the wool over Fergie and the clubs eyes, or perform some voodoo trance that tricked them into letting him be here this long. He's earned it, every bit as much as any other footballer who played here for a decade had.

He didn't turn out to be the great white savior as some had expected, but he's turn out to be a pretty exceptional footballer nonetheless.

127~~~
You only have to look at the guy for 10 seconds to see it.

He looks better this off-season than he's been for a while, in fairness.

Fergie isn't stupid. After Ronaldo left, Rooney was the top talent at the club. You don't just sell that kind of player cos he's a bit annoying. No one is saying Rooney is talentless, he's a very good footballer - he could just be better.

128~~~
Van Gaal on Rooney - "Rooney can play at No 10 and No 9 <b>and he tells me he can also play at No 11 and No 7</b>, but I prefer him at 9 or 10."

Makes it sound like Van Gaal doesn't believe Wayne when he says that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

130~~~
To be fair it is the natural position when a scouser talks, assume he is bullshitting

131~~~
Just a bit of a random bump, but was anybody else really pleased with how sharp and quick Rooney looked last night? Particularly the first 30 minutes, he looked completely revitalised.

132~~~
Good signs for sure, I feel he's gonna have a massive season. Having a strict but fair manager like Van Gaal and being surrounded by creative providers like Mata and Herrera will no doubt help him out too. He still has decent acceleration, hope he uses it more this season.

133~~~
He's been playing really well in pre-season. He's always gonna have the odd heavy touch (as well as the odd sensational one) but he  makes us tick and has done for years. Such an intelligent footballer. Will hopefully be a sponge for all the great coaching he'll get from Van Gaal.

134~~~
Yeah, he had some really nice touches on the ball and had a good touch. Didn't really get a goalscoring chance but he's looked really good all pre season. Looking forward to him this season.

135~~~
Loved his first against Roma, he's pretty much facing the sideline but gets his foot right round it. 

He looks confident, rejuvanated....that's real good news for us.

136~~~
His end product is back to his best, but he is still relatively average with his all around play(haven't watched the Inter game yet), but his fans are in full force due to his goals/assist in friendly games same as his haters were in full force few months before, same old stuff with Rooney, he is either great(which he is not), or shit(which he is not either). It will be interesting to see how will he perform this season under van Gaal.

137~~~
I can't agree with this. He has the goals/assists thus far, as he always does - year in year out - but his build up play and passing has looked far better than it was last year.

138~~~
I agree. Apparently he's looked really sharp in training, which is obviously showing in his game. Long may it continue.

139~~~
His overall play has improved. He looked a little sloppy against Galaxy but that's understandable but his first touch/short passing is showing improvements from his past two seasons.

Van Gaal will look to work on that with him especially since we'll be focusing a lot more on short passing and movement in our style of play.

140~~~
He's looking good. My concern is that, if he has a relatively long injury layoff, whether we'll continue to adopt the 'play Rooney into form' approach. That Rooney, who was still productive in the previous system, will probably be anti to the philosophy and if he's not going to play then how will he return to form.

141~~~
He did play as something of a winger during Ronnie's last two years, I suppose. But he was also not approaching 30 back then.

He might as well have said that he can play in midfield <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

But then again, there is no 11 or 7 in our current system, Rooney just wants to let LvG know just how versatile an asset he is... 

OK, post is too serious, can't think of a good white text.

142~~~
Van Gaal really seems to only consider pace-y players as options out wide and Rooney isn't fast anymore.

143~~~
Rooney seems to be hitting those penalties with such venom this pre season. I know Rooney did not take a penalty, but all the penalty takers put on a masterclass penalty clinic against Inter.

144~~~
You could just about say that he has...  NoPace <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/><img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

145~~~
Not really. He isn't lightning quick as he was in his teens but he's still one of our faster players. He's not quick but is pacey when he gets going.

146~~~
Yeah he played on the left of a front 3, not sure if that counts as 11 though.

Love the commitment to post the comment anyway <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

147~~~
Wayne's still quick off the mark. He'll never smoke anyone like Giggsy or Ronaldo could, but he's crafty enough and fast enough over short distances to make up for not having a high top speed. With that said I still agree with Van Gaal, Rooney should only be played as a striker or number 10 right.

Scholes on Rooney:

149~~~
His build up play was decent for first half of last season too, especially if you consider how shit we were as a team at that time, but in second half of the season his build up play was mostly really poor, so it's unfair to compare these few games with that spell because that was period of probably his worst form in years in terms of all-around play. I would he is playing at the moment at about same level he played three years ago, excellent end product but without it you would hardly say he is top player who stands out in this team. We had few better performers than him even in this preseason.

150~~~
I hope he stays fit for a significant period, with Wayne it's getting back in the groove after a long lay off that really fecks his performance levels . I feel we are going to need him, Robin and Mata at their best this season.

151~~~
If he continues like he did against Inter I think all will be very pleased indeed. Let's just hope he doesn't end up picking up niggly little injuries to curtail his season.

152~~~
How lucky are we that Spain, England, and Japan were all really shit at the World Cup. Rooney, Shaw, Welbeck, Jones, Smalling, Mata, De Gea, and Kagawa all got knocked out in the group stages, and so got to join up with United early and get a full pre-season to understand and get used to the new system. The only key player that got an extended holiday was Van Persie, and he already knows it. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

I'm especially happy for Rooney. The last time he got a full pre-season under his belt, he went on to score 34 goals. That level of production would be most welcome this time around.

153~~~
Early days yet, but the doom laden predictions of Rooney crashing and burning under Van Gaal don't seem very realistic at the moment. He's looking every bit as capable as any other of our players of playing a quick, technical short passing game. And indeed, is thriving on it.

What's been noticeable for me about Rooney under Van Gaal is that his intelligence is coming to the fore: an ability to play clever, incisive passes that others may not spot; to make the right runs at the right time; and to generally perform as part of a unit.

Then of course, you have the typical Rooney trait of being able to twat one into the top corner from 25 yards.

Hope i'm not jinxing anything, but rumours of his demise are looking greatly exaggerated.

154~~~
I think a lot of the rumours were more agenda driven than anything else. Logically speaking, a player as good and versatile as Rooney is always more than likely to be capable of playing under a world class manager.

155~~~
Much prefer him leading the line where his ability to drop off is a bonus part of his game rather than it being the primary part of his role. Only issue with him and RVP for me is at the moment I think we'll lack pace/someone who can carry the ball, if we can get past that though then in those two we've got a great ability to be very clinical with our chances.

156~~~
This will be his best season. Return of the white Pele.

157~~~
Most of it was blatantly agenda driven. As it is, Rooney has looked consistently one of our better players, and is linking up well with Mata especially. So the thread is strangely quiet.

If he'd been playing badly, or even averagely, there'd probably be 10-20 new posts a day of people screaming that we should bin him off.

158~~~
A day? In an hour, sir!

I expected him doing really well, and he's doing exactly that. There are some heartbroken Cafe members, but they'll live.

159~~~
Hope so. This season isn't just about our teams and new managers performance, our world class player cable of winning matches on their own have to step up the game more than they have before, do it for the badge, club and fans.

160~~~
As one of his steadfast supporters over the years on here I look forward to a season of gloating.

Well and truly jinxed him now <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

161~~~
No one said he will be dropped immidiately, nor that he will be dropped for the likes of Chicharito. It's still early, but once van Persie returns, he won't be playing whenever he decides to like it was the case with Moyes. Same goes for van Persie, I wouldn't be surprised if 3 of them(including Welbeck) end up being rotated quite often for each other and end up playing similar number of minutes depending of their form, and not names like it was the case before(and that was what most of us were saying anyway). 

Btw Rooney doesn't look anything better at the moment than he was for us over last few seasons when he was in top form, his end product is great(but that comes and goes) and his all around play is pretty much the same - good, but nothing exceptional, we had lot of better performers than him at this tour. Still has those frustrating moments when he looks as agile as Vidic in some situations and of course his first touch is still inconsistent for top player. Out of Mata, Welbeck and him, technically he is still the weakest link but he makes up with some other things, but once he stops scoring I can see van Gaal having problem with it. It would be great if some of us end up being proved wrong and he ends up having great season(not just in terms of goals), as long as it's good for the team.

162~~~
Have to say I think Rooney has looked excellent so far under Van Gaal. I'm one of his critics but he's been far more effective in the new system for me.

163~~~
Captain against Liverpool tonight. He'll be up for this. Hope he can bag a few.

164~~~
Can please someone tell him that he has other players to pass to beside our right wingback?

165~~~
I was hoping Van Gaal would make him stop doing this slow crossfield pass all the time. It just kills the momentum of the attack.

166~~~
After the Madrid game Young spoke about how LvG was telling them to build fast on one side before switching the play to the other wing. Wouldn't be surprised if that's exactly what's being asked of him, although you could argue he's been doing it at the wrong times

167~~~
I was thinking the exact same thing. I think he believes he has good vision doing that... He seriously impairs what little attacking play we have.

168~~~
Its as if when we're up against it our players lose composure and retreat to their comfort zones. Actually Rooney hasn't been very bad, he's not seen enough of the ball to be bad, but when he has had it its always out wide. His decision making has been totally off.

169~~~
He's only done that like twice so far, and once was the best option available considering the area around him was crowded with their players. This is just people criticising him for the sake of it.

170~~~
He did it 4 times, 2 times in the begining stages, and two times at the end, and pretty much every time(except maybe once when he didn't have much options) he killed our play. It's not the style we are playing at the moment at all, especially when he does it even though he has much better options to pass to.

171~~~
Captain Fantastic

172~~~
Managed to shut 'em up with another superb finish.

173~~~
That was good finish.

174~~~
He really wanted to win that match, fair do's, as did we Wayne !

175~~~
Is he the best player in the league at being in the right place at the right time? For a good few years now the majority of his goals are him coming onto the ball at the right time or being there for a rebound..

The ball falls to Rooney in space in the box so often.. is it clever movement/positioning? Or is that when we complain all the time about him dropping deep it actually allows him to get into the box unnoticed. Although a few times you'll notice him pull off defenders at the right time too, so maybe a bit of both. 

Considered making a thread for it as I've wondered it for a while yet never really see it mentioned, but I guess that's effort.

176~~~
Van Gaal hates him already.

177~~~
Might get some abuse, but does anyone else think that the captaincy actually hinders him? For me he was trying to hard at times, I think to get the best out of Rooney you just need to let him relax and play his game, let him play on instinct. when he's captain I think he's too distracted and it ends up taking away from his game. 

Just my two cents anyway.

178~~~

179~~~
Mixed game from Rooney tonight I thought. Had some good and bad moments, but Rooney being Rooney, comes up with an important goal from a great assist by Hernandez, which ultimately allowed us to go on and win the game.

Glad he got 90 mins. Can only be good for his fitness ahead of the upcoming season.

180~~~
Great goal from a great cross.

181~~~
Really?

182~~~
Not bad at all considering the stinkers he normally has against Liverpool, happy days.

183~~~
Looks fit as feck tbh.

184~~~
Would love to get the thoughts on those who said van Gaal won't see a place for Rooney.

185~~~
There was always a place for him, he is a class player, but I dont want him has captain.

186~~~
When van Gaal was announced, heaps thought Rooney would clash with him and he would be first out the door and RVP would be the main striker. This is obviously when many thought 433 would be the most used formation.

187~~~
They won't get on. Rooney will be out the door..

188~~~
Please don't make him captain. I can live with him being with us and contributing but to make him captain would just signal that we are controlled by media/marketing and over-rated hype.

189~~~
What a pro.

Too bad refs did the right call for his second goal, would love to see him steal from the scousers.

190~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> not a fan, usually, of single emoticon responses but sometimes there really are no words...

191~~~
As an aside, I don't really get why the meeja have decided that Van Gaal's comments make him more likely to make Rooney captain?

Giving him the armband means he's on the shortlist, sure, but the comments after the game seemed to - if anything - play down the likelihood of this being a permanent decision.

192~~~
Yep, he gave it him as he had decided he was likely to play the 90 minutes - the same reason he gave for giving it to both Smalling and Cleverley.

193~~~
The press are creating stories based on every little thing Van Gaal says. There's nothing in his comments to indicate Van Gaal wants Rooney to be his full time captain, and the fact Fletcher has a) captained the side more in the U.S. than anyone else and b) was sent up with Rooney to lift the cup last night would indicate, at the very least, that Van Gaal hasn't ruled out giving the armband to Fletch. However, that does not suit the media obsession with Rooney so its being ignored.

On Rooney himself, did ok last night. Not his best game but when we needed him to pick a finish out of his locker he did. It was his first clear sight at goal and he dispatched it, with ease actually. In his place many would have missed. Rooney didn't. Can't ask more than that from a centre forward. Yes, his build up wasn't as good as it has been blah, blah, blah. But a centre forward is there to score goals. He scored when we needed him to. End of really.

194~~~
Saw this tweet in the van gaal thread.



It is me or his looking leaner than he has done in years?

195~~~
Watched the game in HD last night, and it's most apparent in his face when the camera catches him square on. You can actually see pronounced cheek bones, which indicates a bit of weight loss.

196~~~
I think Wayne has basically been on an upwards curve fitness and form-wise since he came back at the end of last season. Essentially, his training with England in Brazil and his United pre season have meant he's been going in the right direction for a while now and it's starting to show. Could be a great season for him.

197~~~
He took a lot of flak during the World Cup, he's probably out to prove a point this season.

198~~~
He'll be out to prove he is better than Sturridge, which he is.

199~~~
It was so predictable really - after getting such bizarrely venomous amounts of criticism, you just knew he would prove people wrong. He is simply a fantastic footballer.

200~~~
It's absurd that some United fans wanting to offload him before van Gaal arrived. We couldn't foresee that LVG would implement the 3-5-2 to accommodate the trio of van Persie, Mata and Rooney, but the aforementioned are unquestionably our best outfield players. Even if we aren't able to extract the absolute maximum out of those three - and I still have my reservations - we can't afford to lose players of Rooney's ability.

He will have a very good season I predict. I was under the early impression that van Persie would be our star performer next season, due to his relationship with van Gaal and slight favouritism from the manager due to his captaincy for the national team and how LVG speaks in such high praise of him. However, Rooney looks excellent, not only in terms of his effectiveness, but also his overall game and fitness.

It will be interesting to see LVG's selections. The potential of a Rooney, Mata and van Persie attack is mouth-watering, but I think van Gaal will want Welbeck's pace, link-up play and athletisicm in the team. It's so important for this system to be a success, as we witnessed in the first half last night and any inclusion in the team would come at the expense of either RVP or Rooney. That could be an issue, but the latter two pick up enough injuries for all to get a fair share of games.

201~~~
Sturridge has to prove first that he is better than Rooney, not the other way around.

202~~~
I agree, but if you listen to what people were saying during the WC (and build up) Rooney will want to prove them wrong was my point.
He will be motivated by the fact people even thought to question who was better, and Hogdson decided to shunt him out-wide in favor of Sturridge.

203~~~
This. Can't even believe this is even up for debate. Sturridge has had one good season in Liverpool's best season for a while. Rooney, on the other hand, has had an above average season, in my opinion, in United's worst season in a while. 

Sturridge has a very long way before people can claim he's better than Rooney, in my opinion.

204~~~
Lol I think we are all in agreement (context)

205~~~
If Hodgson had any sense like Van Gaal, he'd play a formation that allows us to play 2 strikers, instead of playing one of them out of position. Either that, or don't play one of them.

206~~~
Yeah, there's no doubt Sturridge pushed himself ahead of Rooney in the Ingerland pecking order heading into the WC. A baffling decision for which Woy paid the price. Sturridge was absolutely diabolical in Brazil. I've a sneaking suspicion he'll bring that form back with him and go down in history as a one season wonder.

207~~~
Rooney being fit and motivated can only be a good thing, initially him being made capt would have irritated the shit out of me, but if helps curb some of his less positive qualities letting him concentrate on being the player he is capable of then why not?

208~~~
Lol. Soz, mate. I was just annoyed when people were saying drop Rooney for Sturridge in the WC because he's had one good season.

209~~~
Honestly, it baffles me that he was shoved out on the wing from Hodgson. It's all over now, but what a brainfart. Hopefully Rooney can replicate the form he's shown thus far for the whole season. He'd easily end up with 25+ goals and 10+ assists.

210~~~
Well there almost always are some agenda driven posters regarding almost every player, not just Rooney.

My thoughts regarding Rooney/LvG are/were that at least with LvG Rooney won't be kept on/played when completely out of form (which happens regularly from time to time). Everyone knows that Rooney is capable of world class performances, so nothing new here. But what will probably change now (and LvG has already proven it by taking RvP off at WC) that he won't be kept on and played all the time when he is terribly out of form or not fit.

211~~~
Whoever thought him and LVG wouldn't get on are the same ones who say him and RVP can't stand eachother. It's nonsense. They're not teenage girls ffs.

212~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/M9d1ObVPTee/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

213~~~
Rooney looks slim and sharp as feck right now. Can see him having an awesome season, I'm calling 25 goals which would put him on the brink of Sir Bobby's record which would clearly be broken in the 15-16 season.

214~~~
He's in fantastic shape this pre season, isn't he? Dead lean.

215~~~
In a good vein of form, what's it 5 goals in America. Been really impressed with him on the tour, looking great aswell which can't always be said about Wayne.. 

Starting the season in such form is great as I said about RVP previously although he's struggling for fitness.. With the fixtures at the start, Rooney will really fancy a few goals..

216~~~
I don't think he would care if anybody rates Sturridge higher than him. He will perform because he too ultimately wants to win and contrary to what some jokers say, is not all about 300k wages and marketing model of United. In LvG, he has a manager who will be able to get more out of him than Moyes could have ever got so he is well up for it as is the case with some other players in squad as well.

217~~~
Amazing how things that were forever bleated out by fans...Mata is our best #10, Rooney is best as a striker, Ashley Young sucks...seem to have been addressed so easily and so quickly by LVG. 

THIS looks like a rejuvenated Rooney. Still not back to his best, but definitely better than last season where he improved by default compared to 2012/13. And looks hungry for more.

218~~~
Thats still the case no? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

219~~~
Oh yeah, but last year we had Mata on the wings and Rooney as the #10. Point was that these were seemingly obvious to everyone but the manager, who opted to stick rigorously to what he knew instead of adapting to the players he had.

220~~~
To be fair, I think that when Rooney's playing some of his best football like in the second half of the 2010/2011 season, he is best as a number 10 but Mata's clearly not suited to the wings if you want to get his best, so it makes sense to play him in that role when Rooney can score plenty up top.

221~~~
I would say that when you sum up the parts, Rooney as a goalscorer and Mata as provider is our best option, rather than shoe-horning players in the way Moyes did. Rooney might have more in his locker than your average #9 but he's got too many deficiencies to be a great #10 - the short passing, the positional discipline, the touch are all lacking.

But for me, he's also the best finisher on the team - look at the first goal yesterday for that - and you'd lose that when you ask him to be the creator. RVP might finish the most spectacularly but also misses a large number of sitters and I can't see him slotting in a goal like Rooney did with his weaker foot. Rooney's the most reliable and I'm expecting him to bag a lot of goals this year.

Very impressed with him this pre season. Looks like the Rooney of old :')

225~~~
Still our most influential player.

Playing up front is pretty darn exciting.

The prospect of 2 up front, with Mata behind, almost makes you hope we don't go for the 4-3-3 too soon.

226~~~
I want him to be made captain.

After his bust up with SAF, trust and admiration from LVG is exactly what he needs for this last major phase of his career.  I sincerely believe that the honour and responsibility of captaincy of our club will finally elevate him the next final level of development and he will genuinely fulfil his potential and a world great.

It worked with players like Roy Keane and Eric Cantona.  I think we will see a similar level of impact with Rooney.

227~~~
Rooney is obviously the superior player by some distance and far more proven, but Sturridge went in to this WC as the league's 2nd top scorer having had a fantastic year as part of the league's most deadly partnership (albeit Suarez was the much bigger part).

Rooney had a good season but the reason people wanted him dropped was because he's been very poor for England at major tournaments. People get this idea in their heads that if we use the youth, if we try something new we'll be amazing. People were just tired of Rooney's abject performances (utterly woeful in South Africa) and blamed him for England's failures. He's meant to be our star player so every poor thing he does is analyzed closely.

Sturridge was rubbish though and seems to have somehow avoided criticism for just how terrible he was. I like him but no doubt he was poor, although to be fair to him its his first international tournament and he was far from the only one under performing.

Whether or not you wanted to go with Sturridge or Rooney depends on if you prefer to go with form over actual ability. If you choose the most in form players then he obviously makes it but on ability it was Rooney. Neither did particularly well.

228~~~
Whereas average players dread masterful managers because the fear 'being found out', truly great players relish playing for managerial greats  so they can prove to them that they are worthy of selection and trust.

Having to prove himself all over again to LVG (& Woodward) is the best thing that could have happened for Wayne Rooney at Manchester United, especially with his internal issues with the previous manager and chairman.

Woodward and LVG smartly have given him a clean slate and it looks like it has re-energised our sometimes troubled and wayward genius.

So many good things have happened in so short a time with LVG.  It all feels so positive <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Assuming not a sarcastic question because supposedly Rooney had no clue either. Warren Sapp is an ex-NFL player for the Tampa Bay Bucs - a hall of fame player - sadly like many athletes who've earned 10s of millions during their playing career, he is also bankrupt now (my first thought was - Sapp's going to auction that ball off which is why he is so happy).

230~~~
It depends on how you look at it. Has Sturridge done enough to be considered a better footballer than Rooney when their entire careers are viewed? Of course not. But at the end of the day, it's not what you've done 10 years or 5 years ago that matters when you're still an active footballer. What you've done in the past year, month, week, is more relevant. If the two were playing for United and battling for one spot, it wouldn't be a shocking decision if Sturridge got the nod.

231~~~
I really hope Rooney can maintain his fitness and form this time. I know it is only pre season but Rooney is playing with hunger and desire. He also has his smile back which was synonymous with young Wayne who loved playing for us. Considering things go well for him I can see him getting a bucket load of goals for us this coming season.

232~~~
You wouldn't think he cared if the England manager rated Sturridge higher than him?

233~~~
Thanks 
I don't watch American Football. I can't stand adverts.

234~~~
That is a pretty awesome reaction from Sapp.

235~~~
Only a fool will rate Sturridge higher than Rooney and I don't think Hodgson is <i>that</i> big a fool.
It is how you look at it. Playing Rooney on left and Sturridge in center can also mean that Rooney is capable of playing at both positions while Sturridge can only be good at center so when you don't have much of quality on bench and have to play these two, you have to come up with best possible way to fit both.

236~~~
You don't which is why hes not a good coach tbh.

237~~~
I don't think so. Sturridge last season was more than comfortable exchanging positions with Suarez, Sterling and played like a fluid forward rather than a limited poacher who played on the shoulder of the last defender. If anything he is more mobile, quicker, agile and a better dribbler than Rooney. He would have been a better fit at the left with Rooney being central. When was the last time Rooney successfully played on the left? 2009 I assume. Hodgson didn't have the guts to drop one of them and was just trying to shoehorn both of them in his team. If anything Rooney should have played central with Sturridge playing on the left or right with Sterling.

238~~~
Maybe Hodgson is not a v. good coach but that's not a point here. What I was saying is being compared with Sturridge will not be a thought playing on Rooney's mind. It is what fans wonder. He has been put through so much of pressure since he came up on stage, this is nothing for him.

239~~~
For Sturridge to play well, that system was needed(last year's at Liverpool). Even there, he wasn't played out and out on 'left' so much. It was different system altogether. Just being better dribbler and quicker means nothing. He will be totally useless playing on left for England as the formation and tactics are different. Rooney is lot lot better crosser of the ball which will be expected in the system England played. I know Rooney is better at centre but if that was to be done, someone else would have been better on left than Sturridge and yeah Hodgson wouldn't have dropped either of them so he came up with this tactic. Don't forget the defending aspect of it as well where Sturridge would have done feck all.

Again, the original point had nothing to do regarding comparison of two players' quality. That has been done and should be done in England team related threads. The point is about the assumption that Rooney would be out to prove a point to Hodgson or prove he is better at center than Sturridge. Would hardly matter to him. Only thing which will matter is getting United back to top and winning trophies which any top player wants.

240~~~
It would be an absolutely shocking decision. Sturridge looked good playing for a team that was producing bucket-loads of chances, with the best player in the league last season causing havoc in opposition defences, creating and scoring goals for fun. Rooney's been the main man at United for years and we were over-reliant on him yet again last season. Wait and see how Sturridge copes when the onus is on him as the main goal-scorer and Liverpool have a less perfect season than they did last time round, trying to bed in new players and balance the demands of PL and CL football. That's when we'll find out if he's in Rooney's class. As it stands, he's not even close.

241~~~
Again, too much is based on a player's history and 'but he hasn't done that yet'. It kind of reminds of the people who used to laugh at Bale even in his last year at Spurs, when it became clear how good he is. It's a little short sighted.

242~~~
Agree, in general. Disagree specifically re Sturridge. It was blatantly obvious to me that Bale was the real deal in his final year at Spurs. It was blatant long before that, actually. I just don't think Sturridge is all that special. If I could have my pick of Liverpool's squad I'd want the likes of Sterling, Coutinho before I'd be interested in Sturridge. I'm convinced (perhaps optimistically?) that he'll go down as a one season wonder. Time will tell.

243~~~
Yeah but can he play in a midfield two and is his knee in good condition?

244~~~
It's a season and a half now, to be fair. Sturridge's been banging them in for fun.

245~~~
Very very few people would pick Sturridge over Rooney. Only current form could give him an edge at certain points of time, as can be the case with any player. Sturridge is more explosive but Rooney is comfortably the better player.

246~~~
Well done<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

247~~~
I just want to have a royal laugh to all the bullshitters on here, who were so easily slagging off Rooney (especially during WC) and who were so damn sure that he would have no starting position in a LVG team.

248~~~
It seems like an age ago now, but during the World Cup, there was actually a *huge* clamour for Rooney to be dropped.

E.G.:

Here's a Huffington Post poll from May 31st that found 64% believed Rooney should be dropped from the England first XI: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/05/30/wayne-rooney-should-england-drop-him_n_5420882.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/05/30/wayne-rooney-should-england-drop-him_n_5420882.html</a>

Here's an M.E.N. poll from June 14th that found 60% believed Rooney should be dropped from the England first XI: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/poll-should-england-drop-wayne-7269990" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...l-news/poll-should-england-drop-wayne-7269990</a>

Here's a Goal.com poll from June 15th that found 55.5% believed Rooney should be dropped from the England first XI: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3270/england-national-team/2014/06/15/4883417/poll-should-rooney-be-dropped-for-england" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3270...417/poll-should-rooney-be-dropped-for-england</a>

Here's a Leicester Mercury poll from June 18th that found 63% believed Rooney should be dropped from the England first XI: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/POLL-England-drop-Rooney-Uruguay-game/story-21254713-detail/story.html#ixzz34yzTJ6b9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/P...tory-21254713-detail/story.html#ixzz34yzTJ6b9</a>

Those of us arguing for his inclusion seemed to be in a very definite minority.

I used to say a couple of years ago, whenever someone accused Rooney of being overrated, that he was actually one of the most underrated players in the Premiership. I always had my tongue slightly in my cheek, and was being to extent contrary, but I did think there was a grain of truth to it.

Now? I don't think there's any doubt that he is quite considerably underrated. Fat, slow, no technical ability, poor finisher, can't create - you'd be amazed at how many people will swear this is true (probably on the more extreme end of the 'Drop Rooney' spectrum, but their number is still considerable).

Not only did an awful lot of people think that Sturridge should have been picked over Rooney, but even that Lallana/Lambert/Barkley/Oxlade-Chamberlain/Sterling etc should be as well. And that to even mention him in the same bracket as RvP/Mata/Ozil/Aguero/Silva was utterly laughable.

Part of it, I reckon, is driven by ABUism; part of it is driven by the fact that, while his England record is much better than some give him credit for, he hasn't really lit up a major tournament since 2004; and part of it is down to the fact that, unless he's scoring regularly, people assume he must be playing poorly (while overlooking that he often plays in a withdrawn role, and is frequently one of the best assisters in the league).

But whatever we may think of his ability as compared to Sturridge's, i'd say that at this moment in time, most 'neutrals' would opt for Sturridge over Rooney.

(Got a sneaky feeling that this'll change by the end of the season though)

249~~~
Rooney looks in amazing shape at the moment. Fittest I can ever remember him looking. If he can stay injury free I can see him having one of his best seasons so far.

250~~~
I'm absolutely certain that's true. He's terribly underrated, and very much so by Utd fans themselves to be fair.

251~~~
He's absolutely bound to pick up something in the first game of the season.

252~~~
There is no RVP though. When he's back and alongside Rooney, that's the acid test to see if things have been sorted out.

They need to be able to play together and there has been very little evidence over the past two years that they're effective in tandem. Or at least, more effective than playing just one of them with either Mata or Kagawa and also if playing together truly gets the best out of both of them.

For now, to me at least, it's like Rooney and Berbatov. Great players that don't fit in the same side.

253~~~
Id like to see how Rooney and RVP integrate into the 3-5-2 (assuming we'll still be playing that come Sep)
That could enable them to fit in the same side.

254~~~
I don't agree. Under Sir Alex the two went like 20-ish games unbeaten together. Like 'SAS', as long as both are scoring and assisting, it really doesn't matter if they work well together, because the aforementioned certainly didn't.

255~~~
Some of what Welbeck has done well in this system - his hold up play, his linkage with the midfielders, his movement - is what RVP can do just as well. We won't have that pace that Danny brings but I think having a real midfielder in Herrera, different tactics from Moyes, and Mata as playmaker will encourage a Rooney-RVP connection. Rooney's already played nice with the other strikers and RVP's better/more intelligent than any of them. Not expecting cole-yorke but I'm looking forward to it. 

So far, LVG seems to have a good grasp on our issues and has, one by one, made a point to address them. Can't see him failing to take control of this one. For one, I'd be shocked if he pulled a Moyes and made RVP his public golden child. That was a big mistake by Moyes, talking down everyone else while fellating Wayne.

256~~~
If the world cup is anything to go by, no chance. If he can get that lot in harmonious union, imagine what he can do for us!

257~~~
seems to be back on top form this pre-season under LVG, Rooney at his best will easily bag us 20+ goals this season if not more, if Van Persie is on form and LVG gets them playing well together...<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

258~~~
We'll need them and Mata on top form as we're going to be leaking goals at the back judging by the productivity of this transfer window so far...

259~~~
that's my main concern atm too tbh, we need more defensive options, ideally more experienced/consistent ones, and we could really do with a defensive CM too, the silence in terms of confirmed activity recently has dampened my high spirits after pre-season as well, the first half against Liverpool showed we are vulnerable to quick pressing play at the back and to an extent in midfield, going forward we look like we will be great to watch this year, but unless we can bring some defensive players in or LVG gets youngsters to perform there then it's definitely a big weakness for us potentially.

260~~~
The difference is now nobody is being pushed out of position to accommodate them. They're all playing where they should. 
And berba was never a great player. He was a good player, who wasn't cut out for our level and certainly not our style of play. No such thing with van Persie, the problem was always that Rooney would be pushed into midfield or out wide, or mata would play out wide. Under fergie in the first half of the season, when they both played up front, there seemed to be plenty of potential of a partnership, but injuries never allowed it to blossom.

261~~~

262~~~
Congratulations Wayne.

263~~~
Not happy with that.

264~~~
This deserves a new thread, someone make it.

265~~~
Ah come on, you were never realistically in the running.

266~~~
Good stuff.

267~~~
Doesn't sit right with me at all. First Van Gaal decision I'm not happy with.

268~~~
Very surprising! But I guess it is a postitive since it means that he has impressed LvG.

269~~~
Was the only option really, not that that's good for the club in any shape or form of course

Hopefully it takes his performances to another level though

270~~~
Well it's what his agent would have wanted.,

271~~~
Not bothered. The role is overblown.

272~~~
Great news that. By far and away the best candidate for the job - thought to be honest I don't think it was ever in question. Hopefully some of that aggression is channelled into the big C.

273~~~
Ten years at the club, well on his way to become all time leading goalscorer. I know some will hate to hear it, but he's a Manchester United legend. 

There was a period I disliked Rooney, and I admitted it'd take a lot for him to win me back over... But he has done as much. I'm happy and believe this is the right decision.

274~~~
Eugh.

275~~~
Good, just as he should be starting his peak years.

276~~~
Keeps him sweet. RvP will already walk over hot coals for LVG, so he didn't need it.

Good dressing room politics management.

277~~~
Why do people even care that much?

278~~~
Probably the most suitable person for the role based on his standing in the squad, experience and fiery temperament. Not that I am pleased at the sight of him wearing the armband. Would have rather Fletcher had it but it wouldn't be practical.

279~~~
Exactly. Don't like him as the captain but LvG made the right choice.

280~~~
England captaincy to follow?

281~~~
For me personally it just doesn't seem right that a player who's agitated to leave multiple times has been rewarded with two massive new contracts and now the captaincy.

Not that the captaincy means much these days but it's a matter or principal.

282~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bu3snD5IAAAVM3f.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bu3snD5IAAAVM3f.jpg:large"/>
That's a mighty impressive record.

283~~~
Surprised. Hope he doesn't feck it up.

He's played much better under Van Gaal to be fair.

284~~~
His England one is pretty good for a bloke who has supposedly never turned up for them, as well.

285~~~
Not my choice for captain but looking at the players we now have Rooney is the default choice. If health had not been a problem, for me, Fletcher would have made a better leader.

286~~~
At last I called something correctly. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

He is looking in great shape and I think he will literally lead from the front. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

287~~~
I am completely disappointed. It may aid in the club's marketing strategy but this is a horrible football move. What happens when Rooney goes through his usual slump? He has just been made basically undroppable.

288~~~
We've no real leaders in the side so why not give it to our most capped player who's in his best years.

289~~~
He played in position in which he is much better. Out and out striker. I like that.

290~~~
Beauty of LVG is everyone is droppable, see RVP the dutch captain.

291~~~
You really need to stop posting about rooney. Brings out your inner retard. This is a marketing strategy? Why would an ugly, balding scouser who you evidently don't think is any good be the most marketable player in our squad?

292~~~
+ 1. This slump shit thats being thrown around is because even the best players in the world go dry when playing at No. 10 and making things happen for OTHER players. Mata supplying Rooney whilst Rooney doing what he does best will result in goals galore...

293~~~
Captains are dropped too, especially when the manager is LVG.

294~~~
Not bothered about captaincy.

Anyway, was useless today, so were Mata and Kagawa when he came on!

Hope they sort it out till Saturday, otherwise we won't have any creativity at all!

295~~~
Why don't you stop emphasing select parts of my statements and using them out of context.

296~~~
So glad he's been named captain. Right choice in my eyes. Hopefully he'll have a great season.

297~~~
Live with it.

298~~~
Best option we have to be honest. It was between Carrick, Fletcher and Rooney for me. Carrick not vocal and dominant enough. Fletcher not a big enough influence on the pitch. Rooney however is very influential on the pitch but I'm not sure how he is in the dressing room. Judging by interviews he doesn't seem too intelligent with his words. I can't imagine him having a motivational speech with the lads before kickoff like a Gerrard or Kompany.

299~~~
Agreed. He has scored the most goals for them in competitive fixtures ahead of Michael Owen.

300~~~
And who will you propose ?

301~~~
Exactly.

302~~~
Bloody hell, looking at some of the posts, some of of you lot would love Rooney to fail. Pathetic!

303~~~
Rooney hate is strong in this forum.

304~~~
This is going to be fun when he goes through his annual, mid season, slump of form.

305~~~
I was one against him being captain but now it's happened I don't really care, in fact, I'm quite happy with it.

306~~~
Ye, I noticed. People should just move on and be happy for him.

307~~~
I hope he doesn't pull rank over RVP and insist on taking the penalties. His record is very poor from the spot.

308~~~
To be honest I assumed it would be RVP. Thinking more about it, I think Fletcher as club captain would be a good move, then when he is not selected Rooney or RVP could stand in. This would make it easier to drop either of the latter when they are off form. Dropping Captain Rooney may result in a backlash.

309~~~
Why?

310~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

So on the outside you were being a TopRed but on the inside you secretly wanted him to get it?

311~~~
This has been discussed ad nauseam on the MUFC 2014-2015 thread. Suffice it to say I was not alone in that assumption.

312~~~
It's very strange to me that anyone here can presume to know who is the best option for captain. Only people close to the team can possibly know this. Let the manager pick the captain and trust he knows what he is doing.

313~~~
Same could be said for Rooney.

314~~~
From the little that i know Rooney was the best option because he was basically the main character in the locker room, 

he is the more vocal on the pitch, the one who makes speeches when things turn bad, the more upset when the team don't win and he is always up to it in the great fixtures.

315~~~
I may not agree with the decision but what is done is done. I have enough faith in LVG to trust in his judgement and in his ability to sort out any possible problems that may arise.

316~~~
Thought today was his poorest performance of pre-season.  

Missed the pen(close but still missed), mis-controlled Fletcher's very good through ball, did not make the most of his chance when he was clear down the right from Young's through ball after fooling the defender and putting that decent half chance at the end marginally over.

Even with that said, he was a threat all game and there was fine margins in everything that did not come off.  Another night he could have had a hat-trick and an assist.

He looks in good nick going into the new season and leaner than I have seen him since 2009/10.

His form is going be massively influential this season.

317~~~
In the past four years his record is better than Van Persie, to be fair.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Graphics/1232/Show/Player-Focus-Top-Penalty-Takers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.whoscored.com/Graphics/1232/Show/Player-Focus-Top-Penalty-Takers</a>

318~~~
Nah, Rooney's a team player in fairness to him. It was Rooney himself who handed penalty duties over to van Persie.

319~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Some people would try anything to put Rooney down.

320~~~
if he delivers Im okay with him being captain and in starting XI week in week out it means better performances than today against Valencia he played below par. He should be at the very top when there is no need to operate in tight spaces and using close ball control which he sucks at. even tho I actually like him from time to time drop deep and make some crossfield passes to the touchlines or final passes like h made for RVP.. he is capable of it. if h can interchange well with mata herrera and use these skills to make our play more inventive it would be good to watch but the more centrally he palys the better. Welbeck is the ideal partner for him as he is more comfortabel with the ball in pace and tight spaces. I am a little bit worried when RVP comes back to full fittnes, we can struggle a bit.

321~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Oh how I love stats

322~~~
fully deserved...and he should be England captain.

323~~~
Looking at those stats, Vidal should get the nod next season.

324~~~
This has nothing with being a 'TopRed' or whatever the hell that means. As a personality I don't really like the guy but his qualities on the pitch, I have a different view.

325~~~
If you want to know who's a better bet at scoring a penalty, stats don't get more black and white than that.

I'm not sure they're accurate, mind you. I'm sure Rooney missed more than 4 penalties.

326~~~
A very poor performance from Rooney. The likes of Hernandez, Mata and Kagawa were largely invisible but Wayne was simply awful throughout. Poor freekick, long passes that failed to find their target, penalty against the post, wasted good opportunity with a shot over the bar, another chance disappeared due to a poor first touch. If he performs like that on Saturday, I hope LVG has the courage to substitute him after 60 mins.

327~~~
Great to have him as captain. Pretty sure he will thrive in this role.

328~~~
The usual 'Other plays were bad, but i'll single out Wayne for the harshest criticism anyway' post you get whenever he has a less than stellar game.

Saw it constantly over the course of last season, and right through the world cup (where he didn't even play that badly).

Sadly, now that he's captain, it'll likely be even worse this season. Every mistake jumped on and magnified tenfold, while other players get away with the same and worse.

329~~~
He's been utter shite in every tournament bar one. Good against the likes of Moldova and Poland in qualifiers which fills up his record.


Most of the squad is terrible when they wear an England shirt though.

330~~~
Like Pogue said, whatever your opinion on the validity of stats this is fairly clear cut, Rooney has a significantly better penalty record than RVP in the past four years. If you're laughing at that you might as well laugh at people who quote the number of goals a player has scored to justify how prolific they are, that's a stat too.

331~~~
I'm happy with the decision to be honest. Ruling out his questionable behavior in the past, he's always given it his all on the pitch for us since the day he arrived as a teenager. More importantly, he's a top player, a winner and a respected figure for it.

332~~~
If it paints Rooney in an even vaguely positive light, then it must be invalid, irrelevant, or laughable. Because Rooney has no redeeming features at all, as a footballer or as a man.

#Haterlogic

333~~~
I'm agreeing with Conrad you plonkers <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

334~~~
Right, sorry about that. I'm going to blame Pogue Mahone for making me assume you were disagreeing with me although I did almost do the same thing to Walters reply until he added text to the laughing smiley he posted.

335~~~
Wasn't utter shite, at all, during the last WC. So basically, he's been utter shite at two WCs and a Euro, so 3 out of 5 international tournaments. Which isn't great, but probably isn't any worse than a lot of high profile England players bar Beckham and A. Cole. And this is considering he's played in some of those where he was very clearly unfit/injured and shouldn't have been there. 

The qualifiers are actually pretty tough matches, usually very competitive, and he's been a consistent performer in those types of games on a very regular basis. Just ignoring them and pretending that the only measure of a player's international career should be the tournaments is frankly silly.

336~~~
I agree he's been no worse than most English players. He gets more stick because he's our star man yet just as poor as the rest of them in tournaments.

Of course he's going to have his international career judged on tournaments. That's where it really matters, where it is crunch time. Yes the qualifiers are very competitive but if you can't do it on the big stage you won't be rated for your country.

337~~~
If anything his 40 goals in 90 appearances for England is made all the more impressive by the tournament performances throughout his career demonstrating how poor the team he plays for actually is. They're good enough to - just about - qualify more often than not but well below the quality required to do well (and score a lot of goals) when the tournament itself comes around.

338~~~
Someone please have a fecking word with him about always looking to pass wide. 

Its his default mindset whenever he receives the ball in the central positions. And it annoys the feck out of me. Atleast twice today done it.

339~~~
I counted 4 times he gave the ball away by doing it. Not good enough in general today. Got a goal but he either took too long or he made the wrong pass.

340~~~
Showed desire and a nice strikers goal.  

Some shoddy under hit passes as bad as fletcher's but he was let down by others today, the service into him was not good enough.  

Hernandez and Mata were also dire giving him little support.

341~~~
Not his best performance today. Bagged a good goal, but was pretty sloppy in possession (not the only one) and under hit a few passes today. I expect better next game.

342~~~
Usual Rooney really, lots of drive and work, nice goal, and repeated passes to the wing

343~~~
Bit awkward for Van Gaal when he names a captain who has a bad first touch and a weak short passing game. Rooney will frustrate Van Gaal this season, i wouldn't be surprised if they end up falling out. 

Didn't like how he was having a go at everyone today when his own allround game was piss poor.

344~~~
To be fair if he's playing as a striker this season (as opposed to a #10) then his weaknesses are much more acceptable as long as he's getting goals.

345~~~
Should be main striker even when playing with rvp. He doesn't need to spread the play anymore.  Mata can do that.

I want rooney to stay in the box. His finishing is lethal and heading excellent for a short guy. I want to see him score headers like 2010.

346~~~
FFS! More like you're hoping that happens.

347~~~
He's captain now. Everything he does wrong will be scrutinised more than ever. He has to lead by example.

For what it's worth I think he's looked great since returning from England duty. We all know he's lost that burst of pace and he's had his moments of being a bit of a cnut but putting that all in the past, I rate his chances of having a decent season very highly. Not the worst start for him on a personal level but not winning will hit him and everyone hard.

348~~~
Typical Rooney performance.  Plays relatively poor, but scores a goal.

349~~~
Thought he was crap today. Scored a nice goal and was unfortunate not to have another with that freekick, though. 

But he needs to do better, there were 3-4 good attacking situations in the second half that were ruined because he couldn't make a simple pass.

350~~~
Yep.

Rooney's a very good footballer with a very good attitude on the pitch, but I wish he'd get to the next level where he gets rid of the headless chicken bit and the sloppyness. There are times when he underhits passes that a player of his level really really shouldn't. That bit of precision should be part of his game by now.

351~~~
I thought he wasn't very good during preseason games and pretty poor today, but he scores a lot of goals so I don't have a problem with that. He has to stay up top though, so that his contribution to build up play is limited. He breaks a lot of moves. Would be much better if we played Januzaj beside him, not Hernandez.

352~~~
Was absolutely dismal with some of his short passes. Some consider him to be a good passer but he is only good at pinging the ball out wide sporadically. There is not enough penetration in most of his passes and his first touch leaves a lot to be desired at times. That was one of the prime reasons why he wasn't a great playmaker at a No 10 role. There were plenty of promising attacking moves that frustratingly broke down at his feet at an alarming rate in the recent past. He is like the ultimate highlights player for some time now. Doesn't necessarily impact the game consistently enough but pops up with an assist or a goal every other game. 

He grabbed a good goal and could have gotten another with a freekick that hit the bar. However, his general play has not been consistent enough and I think it might not have been the wisest decision to give him the armband. However, we don't exactly have any other suitable candidates so its understandable but I feel the armband could potentially affect him negatively. I would rather have the Rooney of old who consistently made his mark on the game for 90 mins but was inconsistent when it came to goals/assists and rather scored in sprees. I still do think he will be much better when RVP/Welbeck returns though and Hernandez's poor performance didn't help him one bit today.

353~~~
He can't do any good to you lot can he, Mata and Hernandex had far worse games than he did.

354~~~
Ah, that's alright then.

355~~~
He didn't have a great game, but scored and almost got a second.

Still mature of him he admits that he had a poor game:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11040028/Wayne-Rooney-shoulders-blame-for-Manchester-Uniteds-shock-defeat-but-insists-he-is-right-choice-as-captain.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...ut-insists-he-is-right-choice-as-captain.html</a>

356~~~
Wasn't his best game but the loss was far from his fault. He was trying a bit too hard and it's now clear why LvG told him to "let it fly". When he tries too hard he tries to be everything and everywhere at once; defender, winger, midfielder striker etc.. and he can end up being a bit like a bull in a china shop but it wasn't for a lack of trying and I think he will be fine once we win a few and the newness of the captaincy wears off. I don't think he deserves too much criticism. Several of passes were a bit off but that sharpness will come back and he will be fine.

357~~~
He was poor.  If we expect him to lead by example, it's going to be a difficult season.  Because he's now captain, his inconsistency and fluctuations between crap and great will be a permanent fixture.  No dropping or subbing him during his crap periods.  At least he's admitting he was crap but, as captain, he has to set an example with his play.

358~~~
Poor in general play and a well-taken goal only salvages a 6/10 in my opinion.

Agree with the above post about his fluctuation in performance which will irritate the shit out of van Gaal over time. He can either be a talismanic figure who is excellent, or he can barely do the basics like trapping a ball or returning a simple 5 yard one-two with a teammate. Pretty infuriating that the latter was the cause of a breakdown in attacking moves about half a dozen times against Swansea.

At the very least, he is incredibly effective whether that's scoring or assisting. He may not be as creative as the best #10's or as proficient in front of goal as the best #9's but he stacks up very good figures over the course of the season in both regards at the very least. However, I still question him as a captain in spite of his determination and winners mentality, as he isn't as vocal and inspiring to teammates as he should be and I don't think he looked like the leader we needed to get us back into the game against Swansea.

359~~~
He scored though, I mean - what else can he do in that regard? Playing a bit crap and scoring is better than playing a bit crap and not scoring.

360~~~
I've seen a few complaints about how he was dropping back too much and occupying Mata's zones, its a concern because when that happens, Mata needs to be in Rooney's position making forward runs.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBmSDtSxdC4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

That is hard when the defense playing a high line but in my opinion Mata looked very lethargic and out of sorts vs Swansea.

361~~~
these times chris smalling seems to have better ball control than rooney. his touch is so woeful that I want to cry, a lot of underhit and overhit EASY passes for someone who not long time ago was considered by some as world class. Well he is on decline for three years and I would definitely drop him for van Persie and wouldn't hesitate to play Welbeck instead either. He is still a good finisher and can do some beautifull things at times but he always tries to be creative and is such a slow player with the ball at his feet.. To be fair if he didn't score and hit woodwork his performance would be so shite I would give him 3/4 out of 10 He did almost everything wrong and I also expect much more from him as he is sadly our captain now and his commanding pressence wasn't really felt

362~~~
You think so Wayne? I don't get why his touch is so inconsistent. Perfect one game, couldn't control a ball if his life depended on it the next.

363~~~
Is there any single other world class player with a touch as inconsistent? I've never seen it before and like you say he really drifts between being a genius playmaking striker like Ibrahimovic in one game to suddenly failing to control even the simplest balls.

364~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en-gh/news/4359/england/2014/08/19/5044476/rooney-work-ethic-not-good-enough-hamann" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.goal.com/en-gh/news/4359...4476/rooney-work-ethic-not-good-enough-hamann</a>

You have to live like a top player," Hamann told <i>Perform</i>. "If you want to be the best, you have to live like the best.

"<b>And if you like to party on the weekends and drink beer or a glass of wine too much that could be negative for your performance and I think that's the big difference between Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo.</b>

Ouch. Can't believe the number of ex-scousers out there trying to knock United down right now...

365~~~
Good record that. He'll easily go way, way beyond Shearer too.

366~~~
I wonder what Di Maria's arrival will mean with Wayne. 

If we play 3-5-2 one of him, RvP, Mata or ADM are on the bench. Won't be Di Maria due to the fee.

367~~~
Won't probably be Rooney either as he's the captain now. So either Mata or RVP ?

368~~~
That's where is gets interesting though. 

Robin is loved by LvG. You can see quotes anywhere online. We all thought he'd be made captain.

Mata is our best #10. We just splashed what, £40m on him? I doubt he can be benched this early on.

Rooney is our captain.

369~~~
Mata wasn't signed by LVG though, out of all 4, he's the one likely to be benched if a choice is to be made between 4 of them.

370~~~
Just don't see the point in signing Di Maria at £60m or whatever to play in Mata position

371~~~
He looks lost at the moment, IMO. Doesn't know what he's doing with the ball in key moments, hence he takes too long to make a decision. And when we're on the counter, he doesn't pass the ball quick enough or take on his man. It would help if we had pace around him, but he's a very good player - playing in his best position - and should be producing better performances. (Obviously, season's only started.)

372~~~
His general play has been way off for a while now, and it's hurting the team. He is too slow, passes too slow, his touch is erratic and he is very predictable. Not good signs so far this season. Captain or not these are things you would not expect your top earner and arguable best player to be doing.

373~~~
A captain should be leading by example and he was just anonymous today, just like the Swansea game. Donkey touch as well.

374~~~
Nothing's changed with him. Thought a summer and the captaincy would improve his game but its the same shit. He's so fecking slow its embarrassing. He never ever ever looks to run in behind centre backs. Why does he need to feint shoot so much it's so obvious everytime. He plays every match the same way. His every move is so slow and predictable.

375~~~
Donkey touch yes, but there was no platform for any of the forward to work with because the midfield unit failed to control the tempo. 

Rooney looks like he's shed a few pounds though. Should be a good season for him once the team gets going.

376~~~
I'm glad I'm the only one who is wondering WTF with Wayne.  Even a clearly not match fit RVP looked more dangerous.

With DiMaria coming in Wayne should not be assuming he is undroppable.

377~~~
You can forgive a player for losing pace with age (even if Rooney's pace decrease is a joke) but you can't forgive for being too slow with his passing and general decision making. He killed so many moves today.

378~~~
Terrible performance.

379~~~
Absolutely dreadful today. If he is suppose to be United's 'best player' god help us.

380~~~
I expect a hell of a lot more from him and our captain, who should be going and taking games like that by the scruff of the neck. 

Poor passing and terrible first touch today (and last week though his goal and free kick that hit the post masked this). I'd play him and the bulk of the first team at MK Dons on Tuesday to try and find some form and confidence.

381~~~
I do not understand how a world class player can be so hot and cold when it comes to his form. I would love him to be at least hot and warm, but his form unfortunately skips from being warm to being cold when he has a bad game.

382~~~
This is his 3rd straight bad game. He needs to pick it up.

383~~~
The thing that concerns me most is his poor touch.  Rooney's touch has never been that great but he doesn't seem to have the control he did in the past.

384~~~
Even though he did not see enough of the ball to start off with, he should have done much better when he did get the ball. He should have been leading this team from the front, but his ball control and passing was just pathetic today.

385~~~
Scholes was right. Rooney is clearly past his prime. Just isn't up to it anymore.

386~~~
It's easy to understand - he's not world class.

387~~~
His brand is though.......apparently.

388~~~
Succinctly put.

389~~~
Finished at the highest level. Fergie was bang on and he should have been sold, his new contract has fecked us for the next few years.

390~~~
Touch was poor again today but with the utter garbage in midfield no striker will be much better,

391~~~
He really has the touch of a rapist at times. Hope he overcomes that period of shitness. I can't believe he is turning into a piece of turd the moment the season starts.

392~~~
Rooney is a national liability. One would think he's 6 years older than Cristiano. Rooney has lost his pace - there was a moment he was one v one with a marker & Rooney couldn't get past him. 

Fergie should have sold him.

393~~~
Think there are more pressing issues than Wayne's form...

394~~~
But those pressing issues would have been better managed if Wayne is bang in form.

We are already 5 points below Chelsea, Spurs, etc after 2 games. This is supposed to be our easiest run of fixtures. 3 weeks ago, I thought United would cop 22 points from the first 8 games. 

We would be lucky to have 10 now with Wayne playing like a pregnant Buffalo.

395~~~
He was shite.

But so were a lot of others, atleast we know he does have it in him somewhere. Where as others today couldn't get into many championship teams playing like that.

396~~~
Why are we paying a far from world class player a world class (or even above) salary and have we made him captain while his attitude hasnt been good always towards United?

397~~~
Then he scores an amazing goal next game, the Rooney lovers get angry at the Rooney haters and spout some nonsense on how he is our best player and should always be on the teamsheet, then he plays with the touch of a donkey and does nothing the next 3 games and rinse and repeat. The truth is he has too many shit games for every good game nowadays

398~~~
Every aspect of his game has declined. All he ever does is shift it to the right and attempt a long range effort. Pace, touch, awareness all gone. His ludicrous new contract could perhaps go on to be <i>the </i>worst remnant of the Moyes era.

399~~~
I can't remember the last time his performances on the pitch actually excited me. He's currently just a name, among others in the team. A name that isn't anywhere close living up to past glory.

400~~~
Showed a stat at half time that he didn't even make it into the box once in the first half. He's not as good as some make him out to be, and it seems he gets worse every season. I expected 30 goals this season from him but I'm seriously reserved about maintaining that belief.

401~~~
He couldnt even overrun Van Persie and we know how lazy performance can RVP put on, altho today he evidently looked out of shape with his fitness, still not 100% but well I don't care what everyone thinks here but hes been really poor for 3 years now. some years back he at least seem to be full of legs now he cant produce any sensible piece of movement. Somebody mentioned it above he is just a name. What a problem he could be even in future with his 300k a week and armband. Him and Van Persie it will be our problem in the future. Somebody would say the best player in the squad, well okay but I wouldnt mind playing Welbeck- Januzaj upfront ahead of them. When they are not fully fit or go on half throttle just bench them. We desperatley need movement up front and that is the case of mata as well. Our midfield was really a shite but did they have anyone to pass the ball. Welbeck was by far the better player than them two together who did shit all. But van Gaal is clever so I have no doubt he will asses this problem.. but captain should be someone who is seen and heard on the pitch. Wayne seems to look as shy as Carrick wearing that armband

402~~~
Fergie was all set to send Rooney packing...says something...but Moyes gave him a major reprieve and now LVG is talking him up and made him captain.  I think his best days are behind him but he also still does have his moments, just not always with consistency.  He usually works hard but what happened to his first touch on the ball?  He has watched Chich too much...

403~~~
This is one of the biggest problems with this place. Wayne plays well 'WOW what a footballer, amazing, so proud'. Wayne plays pretty poorly 'finished, terrible, never as good as the bootlaces of the best players in the world, right to want to get rid, hasn't had a great performance in years, potato head'.. Wayne plays well.. 'WOW we are lucky to have him as a footballer. Amazing player, turning it on here he is.' Wayne plays poorly 'Potato head. Always thought he as terrible, awful awful player, finished, hasn't had a great performance in years..' 

The fans need to get a grip. Yes he was poor but stop dealing in absolutes, get behind him - he has it in his locker to turn it around.

404~~~
Still remain of the opinion that Rooney peaked a while back. Could easily name 10 strikers on less money than him who are better strikers nowadays.

405~~~
United's wage structure rewards loyalty. There were four or five imports brought in for nearly double his wage who hadn't even kicked a ball in the league yet. Put it into perspective.

406~~~
I feel like this has been said for too long now. We need to accept that he is a good footballer that gets a decent turn around in assists and goals. He just lacks the quality of the top players around currently and many fans have yet to realise this.

407~~~
This is what I have been trying to say since I joined the café. I am not a hater, the reality is that Rooney is not as good as some make him out to be.
I am not saying that he should not play, merely he should be dropped when off form like everyone else and that he is not good enough to be our main man.
Eventually everyone will see the light. I am sure LVG will.

408~~~
He'll be top scorer at United in a couple of seasons, if that is what we want to try and claim as a 'good' footballer then it goes a way to explaining why the fans are so bi-polar when it comes to giving credit to Rooney. I am sure when he has a great game somewhere between now and the end of the season the fans will forget all of this and give him the credit he deserves for the performance. Then once again will be back sticking the knife in if that level drops telling us all he's never been a top player etc.

It's tedious and boring. But fair play - I can always just not reply so I will exercise my right to do so and take my leave.

409~~~
Two of them likely play for us too. Welbeck I thought changed the game with his directness upfront once he came on.

410~~~
He's generally a good finisher and his stats are always pretty good at the end of a season in terms of goals and assists. His all round play though is incredibly average and we get too many games like today where he does absolutely nothing.

We should have got rid last season.

411~~~
To whom much is given, so much more is expected....If Rooney's wages are £80k/week, I wouldn't even bother about him. However, if he's earning as much as Ronaldo then he should be producing as much as him for Man Utd.

Rooney is finished!

412~~~
Because as overrated as he might be at times he is still at least 10 times better than some of our other players. So if I was him I would actually demand 10 times more than those players.
A bit of exxagerated statement but I hope you are getting the point. Also believe it or not, he is still the face of the club, especially in a time where the club itself is in transition on and off the pitch.

413~~~
Disappointing to see him losing that unpredictability element from his game. His gameplay looks fairly straightforward and static nowdays and he really has to step it up.

414~~~
Because the club rewards loyalty and pays it's players salaries accordingly. When you join the club you don't join on a gigantic salary and work backwards (unless you're a huge named player). You start small (Rooney as an 18yo) and work your way up and when you've been at the club 10 years and given incredible service on the pitch you are paid accordingly. As I mentioned a few posts above this seems to be lost on a lot of fans these days - seeing huge salaries flying around for imported players they just assume that someone who has given a large amount to a club shouldn't be paid accordingly because they don't think his form warrants it.

Also I said above that some players were being payed almost twice his amount before his salary increase around 2010 (I think?) before they had even kicked a ball in the league. These wages and their effect on our club are in their own ball park in terms of why we pay them. That is, I assume how the club has always operated and especially in the last 20 years.

415~~~
He's become so predictable. He gets the ball shifts it to his right foot and then lays it of to Valencia. Fergie knew his best days were behind him and tried to get rid. 
He's lost so much of his power, aggression and speed at his peak which made him special. Now he's just a pretty average player with a good finish on him.

416~~~
I see Rooney managed a grand total of one pass to van Persie, attempted or otherwise, in the entire game. And yet, many would have him as their number 10.

417~~~
I still think he is one player that needs a run of games to really get in form.  The added responsibility of being captain may have take an edge off him which is based on aggression.

418~~~
He wont be United captain by the end of the season. 

Mark my words.

419~~~
Get in the Box! And stay there.

420~~~
This is what I mean by people making excuses for him when he plays badly. Rooney had a full pre-season in which, according to some, he performed at an outstanding level. We then went straight into the league and he played the first game. He has had a run of games. Yet RVP who did not have a "run of games" is criticized for being below par today.
Your point about the effect the captaincy has on him is just another excuse.

421~~~
Was woeful today, his touch and decision making in particular really letting him down.

I think I may just have to accept that Wayne is just simply a good footballer, capable of brilliance, but also equally, if not more capable of being a bit naff... he's not the great player I perhaps thought he was, but that's okay, because he's just the enigma that is Wayne Rooney.

422~~~
I wanted him gone before last season started and still feel the same.  Unfortunately, we're stuck with him since no one else will pay £300k a week because he's not worth it.  Even better, he's now our captain and any demotion will create a huge problem in the locker room.  United were basically forced to keep him with the retirement of Sir Alex, but it's not going to be a positive in the long-term.  

The amount of ego-stroking he gets from everyone in the media is disgusting.  Despite never achieving anything with England and failing to produce in tournaments, he'll be England's next captain.  

Trying to force him and RVP to play together is a waste of everyone's time.  Maybe one day they'll click!  Just like Lampard and Gerrard!

423~~~
or the amount he is being paid

424~~~
He definitely has lost some of that x-factor and spark the he used to have. He can still put in good performances though, it's just the difference between his best and worst is huge. I don't know what happens when Di Maria comes in. You can't really bench your captain, but I can't see LvG doing it to RvP either.

425~~~
You do realise that its different groups of people who are saying these things?

I've always said, he can have his good games, but those are few and far between, and when he has a bad game, it's often very terrible performances unfitting a player of his reputation. He will come up with goals and assists, but these often hide his ineffective and poor all round general play, like last week against Swansea.

This might be harsh but I don't think he has it in his locker to turn it around. Not to the extent of justifying his captaincy or his wages and reputation, at least. He's lost his pace, and he's not exactly lived the most professional life.

Still a very good player though, but I just don't think he is of the sort of quality where a club like Manchester United have to accommodate to every single one of his whims, like Ronaldo was for us (and for Real) and Suarez was for Liverpool, for example. The captaincy issue irks me, because he is not exactly the most consistent of players, but I think that just reflects on the dire quality of the current squad to be honest. I can name at least 6 players in the old United Treble team who would be better captains that Wayne Rooney.

426~~~
He was a bit shite but he suffers as much from a lack of pace throughout the side as Mata or RVP do. Of course this gets lost in the torrent of Rooney abuse. When he gets the ball, he has a big massive wall in front of him because our build up play is stupidly slow. You can do feck all in that scenario other than lay the ball out wide. Mata was no better in that regard.

427~~~
Rooney brings this type criticism on himself. When he's good he's really good but when's shite he's really shite - I've never seen a player with such a big difference between his peak and his trough.

428~~~
If he doesn't improve there is no way LVG will leave him as captain. You wanted the captaincy Wayne so start acting like one. There is more to it than walking out first and tossing a coin.

429~~~
He's so inconsistent it's unbelievable and his bottom level is absolutely ridiculous. Van Persie is a better forward than him and Mata is a better #10 than him but we absolutely must play Rooney in every single game. I think the best part of Ferguson staying beyond 2013 would have been dealing with Rooney better than Moyes and van Gaal, he was never terrified of benching him.

430~~~
Honestly, i don't think he has. "Yonger Rooney" relied on his immense physique to get ahead og the pack, and we all know what he could be capable off back then. Now hes lost that edge it seems, and we are left with a very expensive striker, how is neither fast, tall, strong nor technically gifted. On top of that, hes been belligerent and threatened to leave twice now.

I thank him for all hes done for the club, but imo he is well past his peak, and we would have done well to ship him off to Maureen two years ago.

431~~~
If Ferguson had stayed then Rooney would be gone I would think.

432~~~
Yes and I'll probably be murdered for saying that on here but it could have been for the best. He's holding us back right now.

433~~~
It probably would have been for the best. Some will definitely agree with you. In my opinion he and RvP definitely pose a problem for us. To be honest I'm getting close to wanting one of them gone, or at least benched. Can't see it happening though. We are placing reputation/wages/egos ahead of team balance, and we are suffering.

434~~~
'He brings it on himself', priceless.

435~~~
Well signing van Persie if we were to keep Rooney was also pointless. I used to think we could play them together but we chances are we can't. It might be the case of one or the other.

436~~~
I think the plan looked like it was going to be RvP with Kagawa behind him - at least for a season or two while Welbeck continued to develop. Right now I think it has to be Welbeck + 1. We are too static otherwise.

437~~~
He's like Ruud. He'd score goals a lot, but he slows down our build up play. 

We should have got rid.

438~~~
He used to be a game changer or at least had the ability to lift the team up. But that was years ago unfortunately.

439~~~
Does that include asking to leave and publicly claiming Manchester United doesn't match his ambitions? Or maybe angling for a move to Chelsea 2 seasons later?

Don't be obnoxious. Call him world class (I disagree), or say he has been rewarded for not banging a grandma in the past 10 years he has been with United, but please. Loyal and Rooney in one sentence?

440~~~
Are you happy with his consistency?

441~~~
But he was United's best player last season apparently, which inspired United to a lofty 7 placed finish....
Lets hope Van Gaal is not the type of manager to  take 'commercial considerations' into account in dropping players who are hopelessly out of form.

442~~~
Well obviously it does - since he was offered a new deal after 'asking to leave the club publicly' twice. 10 years at the club, on track to finish top scorer and club ambassador, loyal. I bet that is a scorcher.
Yes, not that it makes a lick of difference whether I am happy or not.

443~~~
Is that still a serious attempt at discussing the subject at hand or just a "yes he asked to leave the club twice, we all know he was being a disloyal cnut and you are right, but my favoritest playah of all still got new deals, in YO FACE nar nar nar naniii"? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

444~~~
No, I am merely stating the facts. I don't even like the guy all that much but there is no denying that he is a huge part of our last 10 years whether some fans want to act like complete tossers or not.

445~~~
You are stating facts and glossing over details that are facts as well: wanting to leave twice (officially handing in a transfer request once), publicly undermining the club and only shutting up when he gets a pay rise twice is very much a part of his beautiful and romantic 10 years at United.

He has been here for a long time, and done his job for us but not out of loyalty. Nobody is being a tosser for recognizing that.

446~~~
I don't care what he does off the pitch.

447~~~
That generally makes sense, unless he does things off the pitch that are directly involved with Manchester United (you know, the club you support? Or is Rooney the one you support?) to the point that Ferguson looked genuinely distraught/sad in a press conference where he confirmed Rooney wants to leave... or when he is publicly embarrassing and undermining the club and manager... whom you obviously support (?).

448~~~
I am not Manchester United, you are mistaking support with vicarious personal investment. Grown men sorting through life's hustle and bustle doesn't conjure up an empathetic response that personally effects how I live my life. ie. Going on message boards ranting and raving about how terrible somebody who plays football is.

449~~~
Seeing how powerful a medium the internet is nowadays, I fail to see what is childish about discussing football topics on it as opposed to discussing them in a pub full of drunkards or in an office with a bunch of suits surfing the net for porn?

A very old fashioned and easy road to take when one is faced with things he doesn't want to face: "I am above discussing this with you on the internets, on a messageboard."

And I am certainly not letting his behavior affecting my opinion of his footballing qualities on the pitch, I am merely reacting to a ridiculous statement of yours: that he is rewarded for being loyal. More like the club gave in to his demands twice, so he stayed.

450~~~
You're not even arguing about anything anymore though - you're obviously upset that Wayne Rooney is a big part of United's history and you can't deal with that. The fact is - he's signed extension deals for whatever reason and is still at the club. Once again if that burns you then it burns you. No amount of trying to horshite around a lack of loyalty paradigm can change that.

He puts on the shirt, the captains armband and walks out onto the field and gives 110% every time. If he scores, looks pub spec, couldn't trap a sack of oranges, looks sharp as a razor then what more can he do? If you can't handle that then it's not my problem.

451~~~
That's not what I said and LvG didn't decide to give him those wages. It was SAF!

452~~~
History smishtory, no one can argue he has been a very good player for is, and a very large piece of our success over the last decade, what people are concerned about is his performance recently and his current effect on the team. Both clubs and players lost any right to talk about loyalty a Long long time ago. All clubs, ours included won't hesitate to ship a player out when his benefits no longer outweigh his cost, look at keane for a perfect example, and on the flip side players in general have absolutely no qualms about heading for the door the minute they don't get what they want, not just Rooney, 99% of players. What people are asking is are we at a point where rooneys and rvp inclusion in the team is detrimental to our overall style of play, personally I think it's too early to say and unfair to with the utter shit in misfield failing to provide anything for them, but as the season wears in it is a valid point and an important discussion to be has now stop being so precious.

453~~~
Surely I am not reading this right? You mean, 'nobody can deny he's been a very good player for United'?

454~~~
Sorry yes that's what I was trying to say.... This hangover is brutal!!!

455~~~
I was going to say. That would be outrageous!

456~~~
Horseshite around a lack of loyalty? I thought I called you out exactly because you called him loyal, so isn't this what our discussion is about (loyalty) or have you yourself taken too much personal offense because of my 'attack' at your beloved Wazza?

Nah, I am mildly annoyed at weirdos like you who still manage to call him "loyal" without choking on it. I follow it up by presenting you the facts, but you are trying to tiptoe around that by narrowing your view of determining what constitutes as loyalty (hands over your ears "Rooney is running hard on the pitch with an armband, waheyyy") and are trying to make this a case of a 'typical Rooney hater' lashing out because you yourself seem not able to handle reality when confronted by the facts.

457~~~
Even I couldn't claim that with a straight face <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

458~~~
No. He went for something a bit younger this time.

459~~~
I am firmly in the camp that believes he should have been sold a year ago, and that United will continue to struggle for as long as we try to play him and Persie in the samr team - although I think the reaction to his performance yesterday is excessive. 

He wasn't great, but he is definitely not where I would start when looking at poor performers. 

That said, the sooner he is dropped or injured or whatever the occurrence needs to be for us to not have to start him is the sooner this team gets going. Him, Persie and Mata will never work - and Persie is easily the better player for me. 

He is still at the club due to the off field ramifications of selling him, I firmly believe that.

460~~~
You really must be incredibly bitter. Unable to string a coherent argument together without resorting to childish insults and going off topic to justify your hatred. (Of WR, don't really care what you say about me. WR is neither here nor there to me.)

He plays for the club when selected and gives everything he can for 90 minutes, I don't really know what more he can do apart from that. If you're burnt because of some crap that happened a few times off the field and want to have a big moan about it then more drama for you, enjoy.

461~~~
Yep. I believe the people celebrating the fact that he has been made captain after a very short evaluation period (van Gaal himself said he had to make quick decisions because of his late start with us) and thus can not be dropped, will be disappointed in a year or so. He is holding this team back.

Scholes was right, he has peaked a few years ago.

462~~~
That edit <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You felt the latter paragraph was not enough and had to squeeze in an extra bitter appetizer to still your anger because I called Rooney disloyal. Heh...

463~~~
Yes, I am the bitter one..

464~~~
Really? Where do you get those 'facts'?

465~~~
He should have been sold a year ago, but Moyes thought otherwise and I don't blame him for that, he was in a weak position as Mr. Nobody in top level management, selling one of his stars to Chelsea would have sent the wrong message [am sure that's what he was thinking]. If Ferguson had stayed one more year, Rooney wouldn't be at United - Van Gaal has indulged him though and has handed him the captaincy = he can't be dropped, it's amazing.

466~~~
He has been a problem in both games so far.  He's dropping too deep meaning the opposition defence can close on the other striker in our system.  When he gets the ball he has one option in front of him which then means he goes sideways.  He doesn't seem to understand that he has to remain up top as a No.9. 

Of course, the alternative view is nothing is happening so he goes looking for the ball.  Well, my take is that's the role for Mata.  He needs to stand up and start making it happen.  Rooney needs to stay on the shoulder of the opposition and give us options.

467~~~
To be fair nobody would  have blamed Moyes if Rooney had gone. Fergie had already offered  Moyes the way out. It was the shambolic summer transfer window which put  Moyes in a weaker position to want to desperately  keep him. As soon as Rooney  got his shiny new contract, his performances predictably dropped to the base level of the rest of the team
I'd don't blame Van Gaal for making him captain as well as he has just come to the club and has to clear up the mess . Rooney's been at the club for 10 years , he is English, and is the most experience established  members of the team, and frankly like the midfield yesterday, there is  not a lot of alternatives as the leadership of the team/squad went in this summer window. But I don't think Van Gaal is the kind manager who will hesitate to drop him or even sell him for the good team.

468~~~
He's dropping deep because the ball isnt getting to the forwards.

469~~~
Fergie had this guy half way out the door.......

Then.....F**king then....The idiotic one shows up.

Wayne this, Wayne that, Wayne Wayne Wayne Wayne Wayne

470~~~
ahh, and so it's all Rooney's fault.

Funny, because on all the other player by player threads, it's their fault too!

471~~~
Who said it was his fault?!

472~~~
Why does everyone assume Ferguson was going to get rid of him? The last thing he said as a manager was that Rooney was going nowhere. And there was reports that Ferguson blocked Rooney's move to PSG.

473~~~
Fergie said Rooney asked for a transfer. Fergie and Rooney obviously weren't seeing eye to eye with each other. Fergie saying Rooney isn't going anywhere means that Fergie doesn't want United to lose leverage in any potential deal.

474~~~
I did make that point in the post

475~~~
You claim mata should be doing that but he isn't either. Our Ball is stuck in midfield with two high quality forwards who don't even touch it cause the middle three has failed miserably to advance the ball. They are forced to come deep or we just wont get anything going at all.

476~~~
Mata is 5 times more intelligent than Rooney can ever be. Don't even dare compare the two. It's like comparing Andy Murray to Tim Henman.

477~~~
Some of what you've said is harsh. We're only two games into the season and all our players are still learning to play in a different system. Once the team plays more games, we'll see better performances from all our players who are learning to adapt to a precise system. On the armband: giving him the captaincy isn't going to improve the weak elements of his play - what it will hopefully accomplish is raise his level of consistency, which has been a major weak point of his for a while now. What I do have a problem with, however, is Rooney's sluggishness on the ball. This deserves to be criticised and it has nothing to do with players not making movements or him not being given service against Sunderland (for those saying it does depend on those two factors).

478~~~
Who's the smart one there?

479~~~
Said a few weeks ago that the Rooney bashing would reach epic proportions this season, what with him being captain now.

And I don't much like being proved right, but there you go . . .

Pages and pages and pages of people criticising his ability.

While RvP, who was just as bad if not worse (as he was for the whole of last season as well), gets off nearly scot free.

Still think he's going to have a good season, personally, and will improve as it goes on. Just like the team in general.

And i'm not writing him off after two games, in one of which he actually scored a great goal.

480~~~
It's demented. Every season the fans need a whipping boy. Combination of a herd mentality and desperate need to find someone to blame for any adversity (the last bit is a very modern phenomenon?). 

Rooney is the most talented and productive whipping boy I can remember, which makes the witch hunt all the more ludicrous.

481~~~
Where as RvP, who was worse, seems to get off scott free.

Assumedly because he hasn't done to the club what Rooney has in terms of contracts, even though he did worse to Arsenal than Rooney ever did here and hasn't really been here long enough to do anything like what Rooney did! Not that I'm trying to start a witch-hunt on RvP, or anything, just that it's laughable that Rooney's seen as such a scape goat every time something goes wrong for us, despite usually never being close to our worst player on the day. The idea that he's not worthy of being our captain due to a poor performance or two is also quite laughable.

I see a lot of people claiming Mata will thrive alongside someone as fast as Di Maria, which may be true, but I think Rooney will thrive more than anyone. He's more accustomed than anyone to having a world-class, pacey winger with great delivery alongside him to wreak havoc.

482~~~
I think it's a lack of self application that has crept into him and set in and I don't think that it solve itself unless he is forced to by something drastic like being dropped and I don't mean being dropped for an off colour Van Persie either, just drop the two of them and play Welbeck to show them what off the ball movement is and the standard of build up play that we expect from them. The thing that makes me take the hardline stance against those two is that we know what they are capable of on the ball, we know that they are better than Welbeck in build up play but we haven't seen that for a very long time. We can talk about an outlet of pace all we like but we all know that they played together the season before last with shit like Young and Valencia but they were creating goals for each other then so why can't they do so now when steps have been taken to improve the service behind them? 
What has changed from the Rooney that was sensational at the start of 2011/12? Application.

483~~~
Isn't it more about the fact that some players are supposed to be our star players, the ones who wins matches for us and are paid wages to take responsibility and affect results more than anybody else. 

Mata is getting the same treatment so far, for the same reason. 

I don't justify it, but I don't think there is any need singling out Rooney as a victim of this. In general the Caf is a bashing machine where whenever a player plays bad, all the people who dislike him comes out from the rocks and criticizes him by the heels and when he plays good they disappear and stay mute, until the next bad game when they come out and repeat the same thing. 

Shaw is a 19 year old who recently made his first move to a new club and who was played out of position and still people bashed him after some poor displays in pre-season.

484~~~
I think that's all fair points. 

What bothers me is the apparent inability to judge each performance on it's own merits. Rooney and RvP were both poor but they were both playing as out and out strikers but got absolutely terrible service. One decent cross and not a single creative through pall over 90 minutes. 

In a game like that it's nothing more than sour grapes and typically agenda-filled posting to single out one or other of them and crucify them for their performance.

485~~~
No doubt. All the players where we have different, but equally good/bad, options seem to suffer from the agenda driven bashing the most. Nani/Kagawa/Valencia for the wing, which all represents a certain style of football. Mata, RVP or Rooney up front as well and Jones/Evans/Smalling at the back. 

The constant rotation seems to make everybody a winner/loser and the discussion just keeps on going with every person having their own favorites they'd like to see.

Can't imagine any other forum being so full of hateful bashing over almost all their own players as most teams has a quite a set first eleven. In United not a single player is a clear starter except for Herrera I would say so the discussions continues in circles all season long. 

Hopefully LVG will get a working formation with set amount of players and people will probably start focusing on the good things instead of discussing who in the first eleven should be replaced.

486~~~
Every great captain needs to lead by example. Wayne needs to step it up and prove to the players that they're still playing for the best club in England.

487~~~
Except he wasn't worse and has only just returned to the team after the World Cup. Maybe that has played a part.

488~~~
It was the same last season though. There were a number of games where he not only played poorly, but actually didn't look arsed - away to Southampton springs to mind. And he just kept on getting a free pass for it. 

Personally, i'm not too bothered about that. I'd rather have fans supporting our players through the bad times as well as the good, and everyone knows that RvP is a fantastic footballer who is a huge asset to us at his best.

I just wish some of these people would give Rooney the same benefit of the doubt every now and then.

489~~~
There is only so much one player can do, with the utter dross in midfield and on the wings it is unreasonable to expect either Rooney or rvp to be winning us games on their own

490~~~
He was considerably less involved, that's for damn sure. 15 passes in 63 minutes vs 48 in 90 (90% completed for Rooney vs 87% for RvP).

Obviously, the fact it was his first game since the WC is a mitigating factor. Also agree with <a class="username" data-user="65492, @NessunDorma" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65492/">@NessunDorma</a>. Everyone knows RvP is a class footballer, a poor game or two won't change that. Just interesting to note the way Rooney seems to be cut so much less slack than he does.

491~~~
Just hope he won't be angry and confused when he sees Di Maria occupying the space where he used to smash the balls to Valencia.

492~~~
Loyalty? Are you serious? Like RVP was loyal to Arsenal? Di Maria to Real, Ronaldo to us and the list is never ending, as long as he does well what he is being paid to do that should be enough, and he is doing a more than excellent job at that. He has been one of our best players over the last ten years and will end up United's top scorer ever passing even Charlton.

493~~~
With supporters like you I really wish he would leave and play for another club.

494~~~
Had someone said in the RVP thread what a loyal chap RvP is and how he deserves a pay rise to reward him for that, I would probably have been annoyed enough to shoot him down as well.

A large crowd on here lacking some basic reading skills. And people wonder why I rarely reply to their retorts... not smart enough for me.

495~~~
he was definitely worse, and yes, the just returning bit did of course play a part.

Still, he gets considerably less stick than Rooney does. From viewing the site last season, even though Rooney was the better player, he still got way more stick.

496~~~
How did this one turn out for you then? Kevin in May, on LvG and Rooney:

497~~~
Van Persie contributed more with those touches I would argue. He was involved in the goal with good hold up play and his run at there defence was sadly our best attack after the goal. Neither were to the standard required though.

498~~~
Van Perise left Arsenal for a better shot at winning the league. What was Rooney's excuse for acting a twat?

499~~~
Oh god yes. I'd gladly go the rest of this window  without another signing if it happened.

He is a nothing player.
You didn't have to go that far back to quote a post in which I said I find him a rather overrated player.

I do not rate him as a footballer, I've not even hidden that in my recent posts on here. Failure to seperate the fact that I was discussing the ridiculous comment about him being rewarded for his loyalty and my personal opinion of his footballing qualities highlight yet again how meagre your reading skills are...

Sigh...

As for my answer to that question, trawl a few days back in my posting archive (since you are in stalker mode like 99 percent of my fans) and you will find I have already laughed at your early optimism of Rooney's relationship with van Gaal. 

Give it time. Remember these three legendary words next season.

500~~~
Too many people forget this guy is Liverpudlian and probably has no real heartfelt love for the club. Both times he's asked for a transfer are times when the club looks like it is going to decline, when we lost Ronny and didn't replace him and when Fergie left. What he has done on the pitch is the utmost respectable.

501~~~
I think Rooney and van Persie can be excused to a decent extent for last game. They barely saw the ball! Our midfield and wingers would get them the ball in 'nothing' situations, forcing them to come backward and continue the sluggish passing. Perhaps they could have both been better in their movement but I do feel it was just 'one of those games'. The snide comment about Rooney being angry with di Maria is nonsense, his pace and ability to inject venom into an attack will benefit our forwards considerably.

502~~~
No you're a nothing supporter, just change your username to Rooney hater will you.

503~~~
It's more that you spent a couple of days heavily implying that LvG didn't rate Rooney, and would basically chuck him out of the club first chance he got. And that people arguing otherwise would be shown up when the time came (hence you threatening to 'bookmark' their posts, for some 'I Told You So!' fun down the line).

LvG then comes in and makes Rooney his captain, while praising him at every available opportunity.

It wouldn't be so bad, if you didn't come across as being so arrogant and condescending in your persistent wrongness.

504~~~
No, I can perfectly seperate my dislike for a player and still rate his footballing qualities and contribution to our team. It becomes rather difficult to advocate for said player's prolonged stay in said team if he actually has a detrimental effect to it.

No hard feelings, I just believe it is best for United and Rooney that they walk seperate roads. Like Scholes said, he is only going to get worse.

505~~~
What's Di Maria's excuse?

506~~~
I wouldn't gloat so much yet. You have missed my golden edit.

Give it time. One season and he will come to the same conclusion as I do. Bookmark this my friendly stalker.

507~~~
A wonderfully ironic post.

The only mention of loyalty is in the context of our wage structure. The longer top players stay at United, the more they can expect to earn. Doesn't matter a jot how close they come to leaving during negotiations. So long as they eventually sign on the dotted line they can expect to be financially rewarded for their decision to remain at the club. It's a simple concept, which someone with as high an opinion of their own intelligence as you evidently do should have been able to grasp.

Nobody is saying we should be buying Rooney a frigging gold carriage clock, or building statues outside the ground (although that might happen one day, if he continues scoring at his current rate for the duration of his latest contract) All that was pointed out to you was the simple fact that when the most prolific goal-scorer at one of the wealthiest clubs around signs a 5 and half year contract after already playing in the first-team of said club for 10 years, then he can expect to be very well paid for having made such a long-term commitment to the club. If using the phrase "wage structure rewards loyalty" as short-hand for this blew your tiny mind, well that says more about you than it does about anything else.

508~~~
He obviously does harbor the thought that Rooney has been loyal to us when I read the subsequent exchanges we had, but reflecting on his initial post that attracted my ire, you are indeed correct... to my great annoyance.

Apologies to the man.

Rooney has to go though.

509~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fair play.

Have a lot of admiration for people who admit they're wrong on here. All the more so, when it comes in response to a condescending broadside from an irritating bastard like me.

I disagree on Rooney but other opinions are allowed. I don't really think the RvP /Rooney partnership is the way forward, so can certainly see why people think one or other of them must go.

510~~~
He's such a bemusing player. I don't get how he has so many poor and clumsy touches in a game.

Really hope it clicks for him quickly for our sake, and I don't just mean goals.

511~~~
Players being signed to replace him?

512~~~
Question is if he really has the squad behind him

513~~~
Maybe now might be a good time to move him into a more midfield role, could save us £40m for Vidal and we could stop trying to find a way to accommodate both he and RVP in a strikers role.

514~~~
Unfortunately, it is a position which Rooney hates and has yet to show he can actually play.

515~~~
Kind of similar to seeing Ronaldo walk out the door and seeing Valencia walk in? Or maybe Kagawa and RVP being signed?

516~~~
We should have got rid of him the summer after SAF retired. Now we're shoehorning him into a side at the cost of an extra midfielder, and it's affecting our overall play.

I think if Gill had stayed on in the 2013 summer, he would have finalised Rooney's move out of the club.

517~~~
He's an average midfielder. I'd consider playing him in the crisis scenario we are currently in when it comes to midfield but not otherwise.

518~~~
It may be pointless to argue with those of you who are fans of Rooney, the mere fact that you are fans limits your objectivity. I do not care about his off-field shenanigans or if he did indeed wanted to leave the club on two occasions. My concern is that he is not good enough to be the focal point of our team.
When he is surrounded by very good players or players in form he will do a good job but the same applies to all good players.
He, however, is not world class. He is a good but limited player who found himself in the right place at the right time.
Just really look at his play, his ball control, passing ability short and long, dribbling skills and ability to create for himself and others. He really is not that good.
Those that praise him commonly speak of his work rate and passion, not his ball skills.
His stats are impressive but he has been playing for 10 years in an extremely successful club. Any good striker if he stayed that long would have similar or better stats.
If the team is to revolve around him we will not win anything. His role should be nothing more than ancillary.

519~~~
You are the very last person who should complain about a lack of objectivity.

Do you think Rooney ordered LVG and Woody to loan Nani?

520~~~
Do not create things to further your point. I never said or implied that.

521~~~
Not particularly. Within 6 months we'd won the league again and reached the Champions League final. Kagawa's signing and Van Persie didn't lead to him losing his place. In fact we accommodates him out of position despite the fact he deserved to be dropped.

522~~~
And on both occasions where he asked to leave, the following seasons Rooney practically dragged us along, especially in the 09/10 season. If the club needed him to stay and didn't want to sell him, that's their problem and the only way to keep him was by offering a better contract. I don't think Rooney would have lost any sleep if he'd been allowed to join another club.

523~~~
You have your dates wrong. It was after the World Cup in 2010 that he asked to leave. The year he didn't show up until January. He was half decent last season. He didn't exactly drag us along anywhere. The fact he wouldn't lose any sleep if he'd been asked to leave is perhaps why people don't fall for the Rooney rhetoric of how much he loves the club and just loves playing.

524~~~
Ahh yes, sorry about that. However, I still stand by my point that Rooney has no real love for the club but his performances on the pitch are 100% professional.

525~~~
He's still at the club, I am a very literal guy. If he's running out in the shirt then he hasn't left the club - I also don't care about what happens off the pitch. People are people as long as they play football at 110% energy and passion I am happy regardless. That probably should have been a disclaimer somewhere. 

You attacked the post and not the poster, that is why the ref has ticked you off. Picture Howard Webb standing next to you uttering some strong words in your direction then swishing his arms in a 'dont do it again' gesture.

526~~~
And there lies the problem with modern day fans. It doesn't matter the number of unforced errors Rooney made like screwing up a pretty straight-forward passes to a teammate, his räpist's first touch & other nonsense he does on the pitch....

Just as long as he scores, his lack of football brain should be forgiven. If Rooney had been more clever against Swansea, we wouldn't have lost. I could count up to 5 times that the attack went south because Rooney failed to find a teammate with a pass from 5-8 yards.

It's surprising that a player of his calibre can pass accurately from 40 yards but cannot make simple 5-10 yard passes. One day, you Rooney fans would raise up your hands that he's not good enough & he has never justified the hype around him. The biggest mistake Fergie made isn't letting Stam go, keeping Rooney at the club beyond 12/13 is Fergie's biggest mistake.

527~~~
And yet managers of the calibre of Louis Van Gaal and Alex Ferguson just kept/keep on picking him. And he just keeps on scoring and assisting.

If he does break the clubs goal scoring record - which would be a major achievement, given the calibre of players we've had down the years - there won't be an asterix in the record books saying '*But he made some unforced errors, and Hannibal off of the internet didn't rate him'.

There'll just be the record, standing as a testament to his brilliant career with Manchester United, and his exceptional talent as a footballer.

He doesn't actually lack for footballing nous, if you ask me.

Indeed, no less an authority than Carlo Ancelotti has <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/6517094/Carlo-Ancelotti-in-vintage-form-as-Chelsea-relish-Manchester-United-battle.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">described him</a> as 'one of the most intelligent strikers in the world'. But I guess Ancelotti - like Fergie and LvG - is just a 'modern day fan' who doesn't know what he's talking about.  <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

528~~~
because he's English & he scores/assists mostly from set plays like his counterparts in Liverpool(Gerrard) & ex-Chelsea general(Lampard). Last season, a whooping 7 goals out of Rooney's 17 league goals came from set-plays. If we still had Ronaldo or Beckham in the team, then Rooney would had about 10 goals all season - how's that impressive?

Rooney joined United at 18, he will be 29 in the next couple of months. It's a disgrace that he hasn't broken the record already with the number of quality players he's had to play with in the last 11 years.

Which other striker has spent 11 years at United? You can't just look at goals & not consider the number of minutes it's taken to reach that number. If Manucho had the same number of minutes under his belt, who knows....??

The games/goals ratio would tell you Rooney is overhyped in comparison to greats like Messi, Ronaldo or even Ruud. Rooney has never been in the top 5 of Ballon d'Or and you are hyping an overrated featherweight.......your standard must be very low.


Fergie described Rooney as an idiöt - a slow learner. It's funny how one of the most intelligent strikers in the world have the same number of goals in 3 World Cup outings as Fellaini who had just one outing.

Rooney had the world at his feet in 2004. I think he peaked in 2005/6. He added adipose cells & he's never been the same. He was actually ahead of Ronaldo in their teenage years but the difference between the two now can fit a Titanic ship.

Rooney is finished!!!

529~~~
Which other striker did Fergie consider good enough to keep at United for 10 years? It's completely stupid the way people try and denigrate Rooney's scoring record by pointing out how long he's been at the club. Like achieving longevity and being a regular starter at one of the most successful sides in European football isn't a testament to his ability in and of itself.

Maybe you think Fergie - a Scotsman - only picked Rooney for all those years because Rooney is 'English'. But if so, that would say much more about you and your general lack of a sensible argument than it does about either Rooney or Fergie.

Rooney <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/classic/awards/01/56/60/64/voting_results_ok.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">finished 5th</a> in 2011, and has a few other top 10 finishes, so now you're just displaying a blatant lack of knowledge.

You should write to LvG and tell him. Do it all in red biro and capital letters, and end the note with 'P.S. I am <span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>NOT</b></span> a nut'.

Because that seems to be about the level you're operating at.

530~~~
We need captain Wayne to step up badly, we need him to be our leader. I hope he's up to it.

531~~~
Mark Hughes had more minutes/years and is no where near Rooneys goals.

532~~~

533~~~
I hope he now gets away with as many fouls as St Slippery of Me

534~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

535~~~

536~~~
After all, he's done such a bang up job for United.

537~~~
Sample size: two games.

538~~~
Not to mention that's it a bit fecking stupid to decide that any poor result means the captain isn't doing his "job", whatever that may be.

539~~~

What does captain have to do exactly? Specific examples, what Rooney had to do in loss vs Swansea and draw vs Sunderland? "Lead" doesn't really tell much.

541~~~
Very happy for him.

542~~~
Dumb and dumbererer starring Wayne in both the roles

543~~~
Hughes only played 3 of his 13 years in the prem, our era of supremacy.

544~~~
He's probably happy with the nomination, after all it's such a great honour. However, the English press/fans/media/illuminati will be twice as hard on his back now when England inevitably fails to deliver. Do not like.

545~~~
And Rooney played with Ruud van Nistelrooy, Louis Saha, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez, Robin van Persie among others. Guess what they're good at.

546~~~
Yes and imagine if any of them stayed with us for 10+healthy years. I am sure they would have already broken Sir Bobby's record.

547~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> seriously? It was harder to score goals before the old first division changed it's name to the Premier League?

548~~~
Rooney looked at them like he looks at Nani, that's why everyone left United.

549~~~
Gerrard's part of it seems mostly to be off the pitch stuff and twirling the ref around his little finger with composed gruff seniority on the pitch.

I'd go with off the pitch stuff and showing responsibility on the pitch (not necessarily being the "clap, clap, come on!" type, but how you play). Not sure if Rooney is the type to carry the mantle of transmitting the right mentality to his teammates and taking hand of new players, etc, but you got to pick someone I suppose.

550~~~
During the prem years we had better players thus goals and assists were easier to come by. Pogue I know you do not like my " Rooney is over-rated " stance but come on during Rooney's tenure with the club he has been surrounded by successful top class players, Hughes was not.
If Andy Cole stayed that long he would be probably ahead of Rooney and he played when we had 4 strikers of nearly equal ability.

551~~~
And yet, none have. Anyway, that was not the point of my post.

552~~~
Cole was on 121 after eight years. It's extremely doubtful he'd be ahead of Rooney no matter how long he played for United.

Rooney was on 181 after eight.

553~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://e1.365dm.com/14/06/16-9/20/wayne-rooney-england-ecuador_3153809.jpg?20140606074040" src="http://e1.365dm.com/14/06/16-9/20/wayne-rooney-england-ecuador_3153809.jpg?20140606074040"/> 

He looks 60, doesn't he?

554~~~
On balance though, he was often supporting lots of those players. And unlike others has played on the wing/midfield/10/SS/Goalie... Even so, his goals/games is still very good considering how long he has been here and his record against good sides is impressive.

555~~~
Get off my lawn!

556~~~
Andy Cole didn't play for United for 8 years mind you.

557~~~
I am not saying his record is not impressive just that it is not surprising considering the time spent during our glory years.
Him being captain of England is probably deserved but it will just ensure that they remain winless in the Euros an WC.
Being captain of Utd is also deserved and will likely have the same result. No trophies.
Passion and a high work rate is not enough.

558~~~
I still don't see Rooney as captain material. He's also far too inconsistent to be one of those types of captain who inspire via performances rather than voice (like a beckham instead of a terry)

559~~~
Often think playing for a "lesser" club can help a top striker with his individual stats. The team will be set up to get the best out of him and guaranteed to get a start in his preferred position, whenever fit. Alan Shearer being a good example. There's no chance of them spending a season or two playing out of position to get the best out of a phenomenon like Cristiano Ronaldo, for example.

560~~~
Yup, merely 3 months in Liverpool and it's hard to recognize him back from his SOTON days.

561~~~
Eight seasons, but yeah, ok, seven 'full' then if we combine 1994-95 and 2001-02. 147 for Rooney in his seven seasons here.

562~~~
Ok but I am sure you understand my point.

563~~~
Firstly, the suggestion that if only England had made someone other than Rooney captain then they would suddenly start to win trophies is odd to say the least. Wayne Rooney is frankly the least of England's problems. Their main one being that they don't produce *enough* players of the calibre of Wayne Rooney.

Secondly, there is much more than 'passion and a high work rate' to Rooney's game. He's a top class finisher, he can pick a killer ball in the final third, he has intelligent movement, he has a penchant for the spectacular, he's physically strong and - yes - he has a tremendous will to win (and that mentality is a real bonus even at the top level, as Fergie frequently said).

I sometimes think Wayne Rooney must be the greatest footballing conman since Ali Dia. The way he's managed to fool managers from Alex Ferguson to Sven Goran Eriksson to Fabio Capello to Louis Van Gaal into thinking he's an excellent forward player. When in actuality, he's basically the striking version of Tony Hibbert.

And if only we weren't all fanboys blinded by loyalty, we'd  be able to see what markhard, Kevin and Hannibal (who are in no way blinded by their irrational dislike of Rooney the man, oh no) see as well.

564~~~

565~~~

566~~~
Sorry but I don't know what went wrong with my post.

567~~~
Well Andy Cole at Newcastle was able to play at Newcastle as just a goal scorer. I think that's a big part of why he struggled when he first moved to United. Had he settled quicker then his goalscoring return would've been more impressive. As it was he was still a great player for us. As much as I'm not a huge fan of Rooney for one reason or another but I wouldn't agree with anyone saying that Cole would definitely have out scored him in similar circumstances. It would've been close enough though. 

I'm not sure Alan Shearer is that great an example of it. He'd have scored goals anywhere. Darren Bent a few years ago would've been a good example.

568~~~
He signed in January 95 and left in  December 01 so seven would be fair. So not a huge difference given how Cole struggled at first. No penalties either.

569~~~
I love Andy Cole, he was a class. Just recently saw all his goals, and those were some absolute beauties. No big difference, indeed, but I just disagreed (and still do) that he'd have more than Rooney.

570~~~
Imagine how many more goals Rooney would have scored with a proper midfield behind him instead of Rooney being asked to score the goals and distribute play since 2010.

571~~~
Yeah, thought that as soon as I posted it. Darren Bent definitely a better example.

572~~~
Man Utd, and now England captain. Congratulations Wazz. Thoroughly deserved.

573~~~
still can't believe some people on here...seems like no mather what a player does or has done, the irrational hatred just blinds people to the point where they don't recognize talent.
yeah, I'm sure there's a much bigger chance Ferguson, Van Gaal, Moyes, Hodgson and the like (you know, people with actual knowledge and experience of the game) "keep getting fooled" into thinking Rooney's a world class player than him actualy being one and you, a fan of the game, not an expert by any means (regardless of whether you think you are, you're not, and neither am I) just don't (want to) see it.
I seriously doubt there's ever been a fanbase that puts down their own players as much as United fans do.
Sure, I don't wanna live in a RAWK fantasy world where every player is the next "Insert famous footballer's name", but sometimes it just becomes pathetic in all honesty. And I'm talking in general, not just Rooney.
You'd swear Fellaini never kicked a ball in his life before coming to United judging by some people's comments for example...

574~~~
Same here. He was my favourite player growing up. As big a fan of him as I was and as much as I don't like Rooney I'd tend to agree with you. I think it would've been close though. Cole's the kind of player we need now. Pace to burn and could play a bit. A bit like a good Danny Welbeck.

575~~~
Looks like Rooney will have to play CM next game.

576~~~
What? Please explain which England player will ensure a victory in the Euros with the captaincy? Pity Rooney was made captain, it was in the bag before that!

577~~~
Your argument is not logical.

578~~~
No, your argument is not logical. Don't play the 'England won't win any trophies with Rooney in charge' as they haven't won anything for over 50 years anyway and it's highly unlikely that's going to change with the current mediocre squad. It's a meaningless prediction. It's like saying Rooney becoming captain has ensured that we won't sign Messi this window or some other stupidly unlikely scenario.

579~~~
Well said. Oh actually - Sorry. This is a 'meltdown'.

580~~~
My statement, that Rooney as captain will ensure that England remains winless does not equate with someone else being captain will ensure victory.
That is what I meant by illogical.
As I said before I understand why Rooney was made captain for both club and country, however, if being captain makes him undroppable and the centre of both teams' attack, then neither teams will win anything.

581~~~
This is absurd to be honest. He needs to be the focal point for England and should have been at the last WC.

582~~~
I obviously don't agree. He was average at best at the last WC but when he scored a virtual tap in the hype began again.
If I am proven wrong, which I doubt, then it would mean UTD will win under his leadership. I think I could gladly live with that.

583~~~
Well done Wayne

584~~~
England captain now as well. Well done Wayne

585~~~
Of course it's illogical and you don't mean that. Therefore... you aren't actually saying anything meaningful at all.

Wayne Rooney for Captain = No trophy
Random England player for captain = No trophy

There's absolutely no point to saying this and it says nothing about Rooney as a captain if England fails to win something. Of all the things wrong with England, who is given the armband is just about at the bottom of the list, just above the choice of hotdog sauce. You're not stupid, just trying to pre-apportion blame unreasonably on a insignificant action for not making an extremely unlikely scenario happen. Basically you're going to great lengths to take a unconvincing shot on Rooney.

586~~~
I believe it's short odd sniping. Merely for the fact that when the card comes up he can say 'told you it would happen'.

587~~~
It might be a lazy connection by Ogden - However, I certainly do think that this article has a couple of decent points.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/players/wayne-rooney/11063543/Wayne-Rooneys-10-years-at-Manchester-United-did-he-see-the-iceberg-but-was-ignored-when-he-raised-alarm.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...erg-but-was-ignored-when-he-raised-alarm.html</a>

588~~~
Forget the captaincy. I just don't want him to be undroppable or the main focus of our attack. Winning in the near future is what I am concerned about not some juvenile vendetta against Rooney.

589~~~

590~~~
Now we're talking about weak management. Rooney isn't the the manager and doesn't pick himself. All he can do is say "I really want to play", which any player who cares should be doing. There is no trophy in the foreseeable future I am afraid, it's not Rooney holding the England team back believe me...

591~~~
Useless. Fecking useless.

Really wish we sold this wage thief.

592~~~
What does he offer? 

Making him captain big mistake.

593~~~
Another embarrassing performance, I expect them now though. He literally cannot get past a player, its painful to watch, any little skill or move he tries, he gets tackled, because he's so fecking slow.

594~~~
300k/wk useless piece of s***t

595~~~
He's been the most disappointing aspect of our season so far for me. Really thought he would step up after being given the armband. I don't think he deserves to be starting games ahead of Welbeck.

596~~~
Absolutely garbage, the amount of times he slowed things down by keeping the ball infuriated me. He's a player with zero imagination, he is just stuck in endless loop of passing the ball wide to Valencia.

597~~~
He won't be dropped either, the twat is completely untouchable.

598~~~
Like watching a donkey play football.

599~~~
He's an overweight piece of shit.  He was too slow to catch at least one of the balls Di Maria tried to play into him this afternoon......Di Maria's used to playing with athletes like Ronaldo and Bale, and now he's having to adjust to supplying balls to a past-his-best, flabby, drunk Scouser.

600~~~
Been saying it for years-he's a liability. Kagawa should be playing up top with RvP like he used to with Dortmund. Rooney should be on the bench (or sold).

601~~~
He can't beat a man, has lost his pace, slows us down and heavy footed - not sure what he really offers as he takes up similar positions on the pitch as RVP and get in each other's way

LVG is doing his best to fit Rooney and RVP into the team but it's not working out at all

602~~~
Him, RvP and Mata are atrocious together. No teamwork or cohesion at all between them.

603~~~
A big confidence player who sadly has none.

Was really expecting him to step up and grab the team by the balls now he is captain but sadly that fiery Rooney seems to be a long way off.

His passing, awareness and touch today was dreadful.

604~~~
He'll start scoring soon but he is one of the most uncreative players in this squad and that's really tough to be.

605~~~
Here we go again...

He actually had some good touches and played some good balls...RVP flubbed far more attempts and was responsible for messing up at least two good buildups we had, but as it is Rooney, he'll get the stick for a missed header and a couple errant touches.

He played pretty well. It isn't his fault we're playing this god-awful formation and it isn't his fault, playing up front, that our midfield is in shambles due to injury and lack of confidence.

If all you can do is roll out the same old, tired knocks about him being named Captain and blah, blah, blah...you tend to look a little bit like you don't really understand why it is that we're struggling at this point.

Hint...it isn't Rooney.

606~~~
We can't sell him now after the contract we gave him. We're stuck with him phoning it in for another 3/4 years.

To earn that amount of money and show that little desire and effort. He fecking sickens me.

607~~~
As many have said for a while. The guy just isnt what he used to be. Captain as well, truly awful

608~~~
His passing percentage was only slightly above de Gea's today. 64%

609~~~
He is completely past his best. Even Torres isn't that bad.

610~~~
When was the last time he actually played well for a whole season? 2010?

611~~~
Shite.

612~~~
Not playing to his full potential yet, like every other of our star forwards. People are entitled to expect more, but it's still early days in regards to the season.

613~~~
Lets start a petition. Kind of worked with Cleverley and England.

614~~~
Embarrassing

615~~~
Yes, because I was serious.

616~~~
He was finer than most other United players today.

617~~~
Not exactly. Fletcher, Smalling, Cleverley, Young, Valencia etc all get stupendous amounts of vitriol, it's not like people only have Rooney in their crosshairs.

The thing about Rooney is: 1) He is captain, despite threatening to leave twice 2) Hes on a massive salary  3) Hes supposed to be, if not our talisman, one of our best players.

Considering this, most fans have rather high expectations to him,unrealistic even, but when he fails to deliver time and time again, fans get frustrated.
Not saying Rooney stood out as the worst today, but he didn't deliver a captains performance either. There are plenty of players in our squad who needs to step up their game, but since Rooney is captain he should lead by example and do it first.

618~~~
I still think he was one of the better players today. Definitely better than Mata and RvP at least for me.

619~~~
Hard to tell on this thread.

620~~~
Better at what? Giving the ball away?

621~~~
Fergie knew it was time for him to be sold. Then moyes came along...

622~~~
Nothing wrong with him. Just part of a team going through a transition, injuries, and playing teams that don't show us any respect anymore.

623~~~
0 service.

Typical RedCafe - RvP and Mata clearly visibly worse than Rooney today but all the agenda-driven haters are out in full force.

Keep sucking on those lemon flavoured toxic wastes. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

624~~~
Sounds like an agenda post. All three were shit. All three are getting criticised.

625~~~
What?

Rooney was awful literally lost the ball anytime he got it. He was the worst attacker. Did nothing and constantly lost the ball.

626~~~
The defence was god awful, even De Gea made a lot of odd choices (but who can blame him, when he can't trust anyone), RVP fluffed a fair bit, basically the whole team was shite. I can't really single any player as standing out in this performance. Di Maria made some good dribbles and Young beat his man a few times, but the whole team was guilty of far too many long balls to players like Mata. I get it, 75% of you hate Rooney but he's probably not in the top 6 worst players today.

627~~~
He probably created our last best chance of scoring right at the end, when he got the ball about 20 yards from goal, turned and went past a challenge, then played Valencia into space for a good crossing opportunity. Valencia then misplaced the cross, and the chance was gone.

Also got a few decent knock-downs and flicks into the feet of Van Persie, but the moves just didn't quite come off.

Missed a far post header that at his best he might have buried.

Worked quite hard, but ultimately, didn't influence the game that much.

628~~~
That is an incorrect use of 'literally', Jamie.

629~~~
The thing is these were very easy layoffs and he completely misplaced them.

630~~~
<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

631~~~
Van Persie?

632~~~
Which is why he refused to sell him? Both times Rooney threatened to walk, SAF stood fast and refused to let him go.

633~~~
He did it aswell but Rooney did it far more times which is why his pass completion was the lowest in the entire team.

634~~~
Fed up of managers constantly putting their faith in him. Imo the team performs poorly more often than not when he is the main man. He restricts RVP and Mata and offers precious little other than effort himself. I said previously, that moyes biggest mistake was placing his eggs in the Rooney basket, and it cost him his job. i also predicted the same would happen to England, if he was moved back centrally for the second game. He restricts the impacts of the other players around him, and does not compensate enough for what we lose from them.

RVBP's best period for us was when SAF had lost faith in Rooney. Mata and Kagawa both had their best and most dynamic games for the club when rooney wasn't playing. Englands best performance in the WC was with Sterling central and rooney out wide. Is it coincidence? Possibly, but unlikely in my view. LVG has now placed his faith in Rooney, and the first few games have been shocking really. Yes we have injuries and <b>i am not blaming all our problems on Rooney. </b>But i cannot escape from the view that other top players perform poorly when he is in the side. 

Rooney does what he does, and given the chance he will score goals. For me it is upto the manager to recognise what is going wrong and put it right. Even with our defensive and midfield problems, we have plenty of attacking talent to call upon. Yet almost all our attacking options are regularly producing nowhere near what they are capable of, and however we try to slice it, the only season in the last 3 or 4 when we have played consistently well enough to get 3 points regularly, was the season SAF dropped Rooney in favour of RVP. 

I hope i am proven wrong, and that LVG is the man to get all our stars firing at once. But so far it has been entirely predictable up front yet again, and simply compounds the other deficiencies we already have in midfield and defence. The one area we have no excuses is up front, yet again we find ourselves struggling to create chances and we see top quality players unable to find any cohesion to their movement, passing or ideas either as a unit or individually.

635~~~
I'm not sure it's ever 'easy' when you're under pressure from an aggressive, physical centre-back. As I said, the moves  could've come off better, and maybe will on another day.

636~~~
Yeah Rooney was very bad, but generally that midfield is not gelling with either of the defense or the attack. No one had any options to pass to leaving players in the shit. They're not working for eachother, it's pretty sad to see, no one understands their responsibility in this system.

637~~~
anonymous today, but most of the players were.

2 weeks to the next game, so a bit of a chance for us to get some of those injured lot back, and shift a couple of players out.

638~~~
Ya as if he gave the ball away more than the likes of Mata, RvP and our so-called-defence. He wasn't as sharp in the 2nd half as in the first, but he definitely wasn't as bad as people on here moan.

639~~~
Well he did, his passing was only slightly better than de Gea's and he was dispossessed more than any other player too. He was shit, as were our other forwards.

640~~~
63.6% pass completion, excluding his 0% success rate at crosses.  Some of them were failed passes in the box but most were in midfield. 

Mata had more passes and completed 97% of them, excluding crosses that he completed 0 of.  He also had more passes than Rooney.

RVP had 71% completion though he only had the ball half as many times as Rooney. 

In terms of percentage and absolute numbers, Rooney gave the ball away comfortably more times than Mata and RVP combined.

641~~~
And he won't get dropped because he's a captain. feck me.

642~~~
He was dreadful. His agent must laugh at how they were able to get that much money out of the club. He's definitely past his best, but the worrying thing is just how far past it he is...

643~~~
Seriously I'd take Cavani over him.

644~~~
That's why he should never, ever have been made captain.  He's easily one of the most overrated players in the world and has no business captaining Manchester United because he's so often poor.  The team and manager cannot depend on him to perform every match because he certainly won't, not even the majority of matches.

645~~~
He was garbage today. He's plays as a no10, he should be the focal point of attacks and one of our chief creators but he does nothing. He's better of playing right up top where he can get flick ons and hold the ball. That's the only thing he's good at these days.

646~~~
To be honest, Rooney should always be giving the balls away the most, because of his position and what he is asked to do. Who should be giving the ball away more, the defence and midfield? Obviously not. Van Persie isn't really asked to create, and was fairly anonymous, get the ball and shoot is his job, he performs a easy recycling pass or layoff when the opportunity presents. Mata may have a high passing % but he was also very sub standard this game and was never able to get on the receiving end of a pass and (mainly because they were way too high for him whilst a 6ft 4 defender stood next to him).

647~~~
He should be dropped. He needs to rediscover his form and fast.

648~~~
We're forever talking about which players we signed and whether or not we should have brought them e.g. the Van Persie/Mata thread few days back. But you also have to wonder why the hell we give certain players long term contracts for not a great return. Today is a great example of why the Cavani link isn't as BS as it may come across.

649~~~
Cavani would be a much butter striker for United than Rooney/RVP and I have said this in the past, he is like the much better version of Welbeck. Making runs, stretching defences, dribbling ability but he can also score goals.

650~~~
Mata's nos. are mostly down to safe backpasses well in front of the crowded Burnley backline so it's obvious his stats are going to look better than Rooney's. You justified Rvp's better passing rate yourself. 

I'm not saying he was great or anything, but he certainly wasn't any worse than Mata/RvP. So if we were to drop 1 or 2 of the 3, it has to be RvP and Mata in that order.

651~~~
If Rooney ever created anything, it would be more acceptable for him to give the ball away.  Unfortunately, he has yet to do anything worthwhile yet in terms of creating chances.  He's been so indecisive in and near the box that he just gives it away or shoots into a defender.

652~~~
This is Rooney, good for 10 to 15 games a season and the rest of his games he's bad but still manages to score a goal. Now he's playing like shit and not scoring any. Most of you will praise him and only remember him for those 10 to 15 good games he has by the end of this season.

653~~~
To be honest all he needs to do is score a goal next match, even if his overall game is poor, then they will be back saying he is world class and we are "Rooney-haters".

654~~~
We all know he can create, and usually racks up the assists and was heavily involved in the fleeting moments of good form last year. No one created anything today, judging soley off this game, you would even think DDG is a poor player. Lets look at the bigger picture, even with a poor performance like this, he doesn't stand out as one of the worst players, that is saying something.

655~~~
Rooney, RVP and Mata have all been as bad as each other. The three of them seem awfully slow these days and it's a big problem when you have all of them in the team. It's too easy to blame it on what is behind them, as someone said last weekend they look more like one of the bigger problems themselves, non-existent off the ball movement and invention.

656~~~
Rooney Vs Rvp passing stats for the season so far:

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Pass success rate:</span></b>

Rooney: 78.7%
Rvp: 79.3

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Average passes per game:</span>
</b>
Rooney: 36
RvP: 14.5

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Key passes per game:</span>
</b>
Rooney: 0.7
RvP: 0.0

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Long balls per game:</b></span>

Rooney: 3.7
RvP: 0.0

All Taken from WhoScored.com

The sample size is so small as to be meaningless at this stage, and as ever stats don't tell the full story. 

But what you might take from these is that Rooney has been much more involved in our build up play this season than RvP has; is marginally more likely than RvP to misplace a pass ; is more likely than RvP to create a goal scoring opportunity through a pass; and that Rooney still loves floating the long diagonal to the right wing.

What's also interesting is that we've only played a *single* successful  through ball in 3 games so far. And that was today, Di Maria to Rvp.

657~~~
I think perhaps we need to ditch all three. Play Welbeck, Januzaj, Di Maria? See if we can reintroduce these three players back in to a functional team, gradually.

658~~~
It's hard to remember a game where you'd give Rooney more than a 6 out of 10, even those he managed to get a goal in... start of the year last year under Moyes for a brief while we saw a hungry, angry Rooney to be fair, didn't last much past Christmas though, but he's a glorified poacher for me these days, best role is clearly furthest forward and leading the line, the old drop a shoulder, beat a man, direct, run with the ball type player he once was has truely disapeared from his game.

659~~~
he cant be dropped. He is the captain and is on astronomical wages.

660~~~
He can be dropped. LVG: "I'm not starting you today Rooney, I want you to come on later". Or whatever, this whole "he can't be dropped" is a crock of shit.

661~~~
Utter shit today along with rvp. Fed up with both of them.

662~~~
What difference does that make? Of course he can be dropped.

663~~~
Some of you are Rooney haters, and it is blatantly obvious.

A 'Rooney hater' isn't someone who e.g. thinks Wayne Rooney is over rated, or no longer good enough for Manchester United. That he's a bit slower than he used to be, a bit less explosive, and is no longer a match winner justifying £250'000 a week. That's a fair enough argument to make, although there is a good counter-argument for it as well.

It's just that from some quarters, it comes with such bile that you can tell it isn't just about his footballing skills, and there is a bit of an agenda there.

(Go look at how many posts there are criticising RvP in the RvP thread for example - a player who's not actually been as good as Rooney over the last 15 months or so)

664~~~
RVP never threatened to leave his team.

665~~~
Rooney was awful today....I often wonder is Welbeck a better player than Rooney?..Is Welbeck getting sacraficed because we simply would never find a buyer for Rooney? Rooney was nowhere near as awful as Mata and Valencia today but on current form Rooney is on a salary that is paying him 3 times more than he should be getting...
Rooney wouldn't get near the first team line up in most top 10 Euro clubs

666~~~
No youre right. He just left his team and joined us.

667~~~
Rooney had an entire preseason to get into form and fitness, while RVP has only had 120 minutes of football since the end of the World Cup.

668~~~
He's incredibly smelly & should be wellied into the sun; preferably not by Valencia though.

669~~~
300K a week <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

670~~~
I think he is past it.  Now we have a massive long term wage bill on our hands, who is captain, and has a first touch about as good as Chich.

671~~~
Rooney in the team on reputation rather than performance.

672~~~
Who from our forwards does currently deserve to be in the team? He's the only one of 'em to actually score in the league this season.

673~~~
He's a problem currently for us and England.

Fergie knew when he moved him to CM that his best days as a striker were over.

674~~~
I'll do it, oh please let me do it! If I miss I'll kick him again and again until I get it right I promise!

675~~~
My point has always been that he is over-rated. If he is a good as you obviously think he is how come in 90 minutes he cannot even create a couple good scoring opportunities for himself? I don't care how out of form a top player is, in 90 minutes he must be able to at least beat a man or two and make an attempt at goal.
By the way the only time I have seen Rooney in a non-football situation was sometime ago when he was pranked by Rio, involving a pet shop I think. He came across as a nice guy. My problem with him is not personal. Not even with his supposed wage demands. Its purely football-related.
I just don't get how intelligent people cannot look at his overall play and not realize he is not good enough to be our main focus of attack.
Is it patriotism? Is it the English bulldog spirit of graft Vs guile/ skill?

676~~~
At last, an unbiased opinion!

677~~~
The funny thing is I'm no longer the most extreme one in here.... Time to up my game I think

678~~~
Which tells you something about the players' decisiveness.

679~~~
Did Mata, RvP or Di Maria do that? No? Then the people who think they are excellent players who are currently misfiring are wrong! They created no chances for themselves away to Burnley, and so are obviously nowhere near as good as their fans think they are.

Rooney got a key pass to his name today, as did Di Maria. RvP didn't make any. Rooney also completed one successful dribble to RvP's none.

So by your own criteria, maybe it's RvP you should be directing this kind of stuff at.

Yeah, okay.

Do you include LvG in that?

Maybe it's because Rooney can still score and create at levels which match or outstrip supposedly 'superior' players that he's continued to be picked by all the managers to whom he's been available to.

680~~~
Not here to critique him per se because Mata and Robin have equally underwhelming if not more so. But even leaving the natural physical decline aside - there's something I've noticed a lot in recent years and probably lots of supporters have done the same : Wayne just doesn't seem to have the bullishness of the younger version which made believers of all of us. 

When he arrived at United and even during the mid to late-ish 2000s, he just seemed to be a bit of an X-rated nutter on the field who gave no effs, always crunching into tackles, harrying and hounding the nearest ball carrier, messing with opposition players, sarcastically applauding referee decisions. That ability is still evident in flashes particularly under DM last season but not for sustained periods. 

I do wonder if in trying to contain that renegade behavior Fergie instead neutered one aspect that made him such a dangerous player. Maybe he should've been left alone and didn't need tampering. You no longer see that fierce competitive glint and fierce desire in his eyes that was so trademark Rooney and that is a bit of a travesty. He was the ultimate blue-collar player back then. Just seems too PR friendly now for lack of a better word. Please turn the beast mode back on Wayne. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

681~~~
LVG is a known member of the English defence league. The whole 'British players are undroppable' conspiracy went out with Moyes, you need another angle, the fans don't pick the players the manager does. RVP was also dire today, lets see if he gets dropped next game.

682~~~
I think it's a interesting point. The whole team seems to lack a backbone at the moment. To be honest in Rooney's better days (United's better days too, odd that) we probably had more characters in general, that probably helped. I don't blame Fergie for getting him to tone it down a bit as getting sent off is no way to win a game. Rooney could have gone the same way as some other players, but instead has had a quite consistent successful career under SAF.  He became a more rounded player but did lose a bit of his arrogance, right now we could use a bit of the old mentality but not just from Rooney.

683~~~
RVP got off a few good attempts at goal and looked far more dangerous than Rooney.
LVG's attitude towards Rooney is still evolving so, we shall see where it stands at the end of the season.
Look we both want a successful UTd but obviously we see the means by which we accomplish it differently.

684~~~
Thought he played ok in the second half, tried to make things happen even though he wasn't at his best. Doesn't merit the hate he is getting atm. The truth is this very few midfields can carry the sluggish trio that is Rooney, Mata and Van Persie. After the break we need to field this;
----------------------De Gea-----------------------
Rafa-------Smalling----------Jones--------Shaw
-------------Blind---------Herrera--------------
------------------Di  Maria-----------------------
Januzaj-----------Rooney---------Welbeck
Welbeck playing a dual role with his starting point in the build up and off the ball being on the left and Di Maria starting as part of the three that can drift to the left to cover Welbeck's move inwards like he did for Christiano. We need pace and vibrancy that Mata and RvP just aren't offering atm. I think with such a set up we will create more and be in control of games.

685~~~
Beyond his shot in the first half, which was an excellent piece of skill to bring the ball down on his chest and then get a volley off, I can't recall another occasion where his actions threatened the goal.

686~~~
He had a half chance from a header that he put over. It was a difficult chance though.

687~~~
When was the last time he had a great performance against a half decent opposition or scored an important goal for us? Leverkusen?

688~~~
I honestly believe that 90% of Rooney's problem is that he feels he needs to play 7positions, and the way this team is .... who can blame him. Once the team is set and good enough for him to concentrate on being just a striker, i think we will see a vastly improved Rooney.

Half of the balls Rooney "misplaced" were due to RvP just being to slow to react as well.

689~~~
Another very disappointing performance today. Although Van Persie was worse.

690~~~
This is a very good point, and to be honest I was one of his most vocal critics every time he did something like clapping the ref or getting sent off, and wanted him to cut it out. Unfortunately it looks like I was wrong and since he has cut it out he is not the same player. Agreed, he needs to be more fiery and less restrained.

691~~~
Euros? A bit less, as he's on around 225k BP.

692~~~
The header, as mentioned above, as well as shot cleared off the line my a Burnley player.

693~~~
This is plain subjectivity. It could just as easily be due to Rooney playing the ball in the wrong place.

694~~~
This is what I meant by an English bulldog mentality of graft Vs guile/ skill. I think some admire(d) his high work rate and passion while I prefer silky skill and technique.

695~~~
His touch annoys the shit out of me, ping a ball into his feet when he's got a defender on him and he generally fecks it up. He was wank today and his sporadic form gets on my tits, does anyone else generally dislike Wayne Rooney or is it me alone.

696~~~
Does anybody know if players receive their full weekly wage if they don't play?

If so, dropping him might be the kick up the arse he needs, not to mention Stretford will be breathing down his neck.

If not, then we've probably the seen the best of Rooney. He peaked in 2010.

697~~~
No I think it's a rather weak excuse to be honest. You can still retain that bit of fire while not acting like a twat and to suggest otherwise implies he is too unintelligent to differentiate that for himself. I don't think anyone is that stupid. He has lost it, that edge that made him special and there is no sign of it coming back. Everything he does is telegraphed. I'm at a loss as to why he is England's captain because his performances do not warrant that at all.

698~~~
I think he has become one of the main culprits at slowing down our attack lately. he picks the ball up and the edge of the box, turns his back to goal, holds onto the ball for too long and then just passes it, given the defenders plenty of time to get into good positions.

699~~~
Are you serious? Your not sure he is that stupid? He is more likely to be released back into the wild than win a Nobel prize after retierment mate

700~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

701~~~
Pretty harsh on Liverpool, still made me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

702~~~
Not sure if serious. If yes, yep, of course they do! That's the worst thing with players on high wages, who hardly play.

703~~~
Haha, liverpool is the wild anyway so thats a given.

704~~~
This is a good example of that

705~~~
Genuinely wasn't sure. I thought they might be incentivised, i.e. receiving a percentage of their 'full' fee if they don't play, and the whole lot when they do. Just seems a bit of a moral hazard to me. Sign a 5-year contract, big money and then decide not to give a feck, and you still receive your full wage.

706~~~
'Kin 'ell. That is such poor play by Rooney. That's not even an isolated incident, either, it's a regular occurrence.

707~~~
I think more and more of us are starting to see why Fergie wanted to discard him two seasons ago. Obviously he is still a great proven PL player but the position in which he plays in at one of the best clubs in the world - he doesn't warrant a starting spot anymore. 

Anyone trying to argue otherwise is lying to themselves IMO - I think the last time he was great was during the second half of 2010-2011... and in that team he had quick players around him to complement his vision (Hernandez, Nani, Valencia, Park). 

And out of Rooney, Mata and RvP - at this point in time you would have to say Rooney is probably the most sellable considering age, and also the fact we just bought Mata six months ago. I wonder what was going through LvG's head when he made Rooney captain - but I wouldn't rule it out if Rooney was now sold sooner rather than later...

708~~~
What is our exit strategy here? Do we even have one? Or are we married to him and his wages, for better or for worse, and the armband is the symbol of that pain?

709~~~
Rooney <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

710~~~
When I see him nowadays, reminds me of Berbatov later days. Berba was gladly willing to sit on the bench, riding on that big wage and long contract where none big club was willing to pay. He's still playing a few times for big club thus his name was still famous by association. All that, while continued for being lazy and fecking useless when played, and wouldn't want to learn and adapt to new position as a player.

711~~~
Exactly. But not just him, I feel other players also did the same thing like our centre mid and our wing back. Even Mata joins the party as well. I feel like it's only Di Maria is willing to go forward and forward and always play quick tempo. Januzaj and Welbeck also in the category of what Di Maria is doing right now.

712~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

713~~~
So bloody ridiculous that. It's like watching Ashley Young in an advanced position, who's paid 300k/week.

714~~~
What's he supposed to do there? Burnley defended that situation perfectly, had men back in numbers and tracked every run. Obvious thing to do was maintain possession and try to change the angle of attack.

This second by second micro- analysis that is all the rage on here really does end up criticising players for the strangest things.

715~~~
Rabona flick it into Di Maria's path?

We really need Rooney and the rest of our forwards to step up, they can't keep missing the kind of chances we missed during the Burnley game if we want to make top 4. All of our front men missed very easy chances during that game which is such a shame. Look at the hunger our rival's strikers show, the likes of Sturridge, Aguero and Costa who do everything in their power to be in the right positions at the right time to score goals and to get at the end of every ball. They also work extremely hard to make runs and create space for others, something which I haven't seen our forwards doing so far this season. Rooney was especially atrocious with his sunday league football touch during these opening 3 games.

716~~~
There was a shit load of space on his left, he could easily turn into that area and do something, oh forgot Rooney hasnt passed a defender in years.

717~~~
Turn with the ball and run at the defenders or play it to RVP and maybe set up a one-two or something? You know, something like Ronaldo, Messi, Robben, anyone half decent and positive would actually do.

Hell, I'd be looking to turn and run at people there and I'm shite.

718~~~
It's utterly ridiculous. He hasn't played that well so far this season, but no-one in the midfield or forward areas has yet.

You don't need a meaningless 3 second gif, onto which people can project their own opinions about what should or shouldn't have happened, to tell you that.

719~~~
First off, no excusing his shit start. But I am sick of seeing rooney getting so involved in the buildup. He needs to stay in the box where he is at his best. 

People expect rooney to simply carry United and England bit he has never been that type of player and Messi Ronaldo robben and zlatan are the closest players that can and even they can't individually carry a team to a world cup or cl final.

When rooney gets involved in the buildup he over thinks everything because his passing and shooting are both amazing. But when he has time to think he fecks up. Makes him look terrible at times. 

He is at his best acting on instinct like counter attacking and finishing in the box. Even his one touch passing I  the box is good.

I never wanna see him 40 or so yards out looking for options. Someone else needs to be doing this all the time.

We also need the defenders and deep midfielders to move the ball to the forwards faster. 
Rooney, rvp and Mata aren't this bad. Our buildup and slow style is making everyone look horrible.

720~~~
Scholes on BTsport this evening: "Kagawa needed a 10 game run to show what he can do. Never given a chance, yet Rooney had 10 years."

721~~~
true.

722~~~
? Did he say that? Did you listen to it or just read it somewhere?

Rooney has been annoying me for a while now with his below-par performances, but that supposed statement by Scholes is wrong on so many levels. If he really said that then he should retire immediately as a pundit. Noone in his right mind could compare Rooney's importance to us especially until 2010/11 to what Kagawa did here in 2 years!

723~~~
I was merely providing an example of what another poster said. That gif wasn't meant to sum up Rooney's entire performances. I can't believe you can see nothing wrong with that gif anyways. Look at all the space to his left. He has two options. Run at the players and try to pass it to either Di Maria or RVP provided they make runs or he can do a simple 1-2 with Di Maria. Why do you think Di Maria ran into that space after the pass?

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.minus.com/ibl7CaG1pgkFN0.gif" src="http://i.minus.com/ibl7CaG1pgkFN0.gif"/>

Look at all that space. I'm sure he couldn't do anything there.

724~~~
This is when he didn't play the give and go Di Maria asked to right ? It infuriated it me but at the same time I realized that type of football isn't natural to Wayne. He prefers the long diagonals to his buddy Valencia.

725~~~
So the problem is Wayne and therefore we need to stop playing him.

726~~~
I firmly believe that 3-5-2 should be put to be and move to things like 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 with one striker up top.

727~~~
It's a perfectly valid point, just look at any of the player performance threads from last season, players like kagawa and chich getting pelters for not coming into the team and having an immediate impact, usually from the exact same posters who have spent the last ten years defending Rooney every single season when he goes through his yearly shit spell saying he needs games to find form. If that can be applied to one player why is it not fair to say it about another?

728~~~
It's not a valid point though. Kagawa hasn't done anything to warrant starting games, nothing at all. If the only argument for him starting is that the rest are shite then you know it's a poor argument. Rooney himself has played loads and loads of games out of position so it's not like Kagawa is some sort of exception.

729~~~
Oh don't get me wrong, Rooney has deteriorated so much in the last 2-3 years (which surprisingly his fanbois can't admit) that I couldn't care less if he left today. Those same fanbois are blaming Mata all the time, who has only been here for 6 months. Whereas Rooney over the last few years has been an integral part of some of the worst football we have been playing, which started and never improved way before there were even any signs of Mata joining us. Not to mention Rooney should be at his absolute peak with 29, but all he is for years now is a shadow of the player he once was. And they call him "creative"!!

And yes, Scholes can say that Rooney needs a run of games to get into form, so why not Kagawa. But with his pointless statement mentioning his 10 years he seems to question his entire time or form during all those years with us. And everyone knows how integral he was in his early years for us. It's a bit like saying "Pogba just needed a run of games in the first team, Scholes got 20 years".

I just find his statement a bit sad, even as someone who can see all of Rooney's faults and would be extremely happy if we replaced him with a far better striker within a minute.

730~~~
It's the same. It's stupid, that's why I think it's fake. Noone verified it anyway.

731~~~
If Scholes said that (which he probably didn't) I can only assume he didn't catch Rooney's debut.

732~~~
Run into the exact same space Di Maria is running into? Yeah, that makes sense.

733~~~
Because Di Maria's marker tracked his run perfectly. That was the obvious pass but once he'd realised it wasn't on, there wasn't much else to do other than what he did. Seriously, that gif is a really strange 2 or 3 seconds to use as criticism.

734~~~
Pretty sure Di Maria has the pace and the close control to get away from him.

Either that or Rooney turns and goes at the defence.

Basically anything other than what he actually did which gave Burnley all the time in the world to set up. Forwards are supposed to go forward and be positive, Rooney went backwards.

735~~~
I don't know, if the ball has the perfect weight then Di Maria gets to it before his marker do doubt. Let's just forget that specific moment though, in general Rooney slowed things down by taking too many touches after his first touch was not good enough. He's too brainwashed to go wide all the time. There is very little variety to his play

736~~~
I can't believe people are criticising him based on that GIF <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

737~~~
When it's obvious what <i>could </i>be done in that situation, why can't we criticse him?

738~~~
I could sit and watch the the weekends games, and probably give you countless GIFs like that from other 'top' players.

Shorn of any context, they are utterly pointless, and it's hard not to see an axe being ground here.

739~~~
You certainly could. It's not a witch hunt of Rooney, we'd be saying the same thing if someone else had done the same thing he did.

The context was we were attacking, played the ball forward, Rooney failed to turn on it and take the positive approach by either running at defenders or laying in Di Maria/RVP and went backwards allowing Burnley to get back into place. Football games are won on decisions like that.

740~~~
So no-one else for United made any - in your opinion - poor attacking decisions on Saturday? Because if they had, you'd be GIF-ing them in all the respective threads, right?

Seeing as how those GIFs aren't there, I can only presume the rest of the team must have been flawless (although that's not quite how I remember it).

741~~~
The only two players in the squad who would, no doubts whatsoever, have attempted to play Di Maria in first time are Welbeck and Herrera. Maybe Clverley at a push.
van Persie would have slowed things down; Kagawa would have done what Rooney did - but even slower, and probably even a pass backwards to Fletcher instead of even sideways; Mata may have turned towards goal, but may have done the same as Rooney too.

It's not just a Rooney problem. Its a whole team problem.

Rooney does it because of his erratic first touch, Mata and Kagawa are too casual, van Persie just slows things down even though he has the ability to pull that pass off. Either way, it's the type of pass that creates great positions, so it's something we need to start doing more of. Dortmund, Bayern and Arsenal do loads of it.

742~~~
If the gifs were posted then we could talk about them. Fact is, this one was and it highlighted bad play.

743~~~
This is the Rooney after all, what did you expect ?

744~~~
This is why a 3 second GIF shorn of any context is pretty much useless in assessing a player's performance.

We don't even know if Welbeck or Herrera would have been stood in that position on the pitch to start with. We don't know what they would have attempted if they had been. There are just so many variables as to make the exercise of judging performance based on one GIF futile.

What we do know, working from a large sample size, is that the things Rooney does on a football pitch, the decisions he takes, are more likely to lead to goals than the decisions Kagawa (in his Utd guise), Welbeck and Cleverley make. That's a big reason why he always has better combined scoring, assist and key pass rates than the others do.

In that one, isolated incident, maybe they'd have done better than Rooney.

Even *if* that's the case, that doesn't mean they are therefore better players, or more deserving of a place in the team. Because they have weaknesses as well - and we don't need silly GIFS to demonstrate that -  which on balance make them less effective players than Rooney is.

What we might lose by playing Rooney, we gain more in other aspects.

745~~~
So what say y'all to this theory?

That the signings of Falcao, Di Maria and Herrera will actually take the pressure off Rooney somewhat.

In four of the five seasons since Ronaldo left, he's been very much regarded as the 'main man'. Our best player, and the guy we looked at to inspire us to success.

And I wonder if Rooney has felt that burden somewhat, with his apparent desire to want to score the goals, create the goals, help out in midfield, defend, write the theme tune, and sing the theme tune.

Now he's just another very good attacking player among the multitude. The pressure isn't *all* on him to perform. He'll be allowed to have an off game and someone else will step up (just as he might step up when they have an off game).

The best case scenario is that this unshackles him - 'let it fly!' as LvG said - and we see a happy, flowing, exciting Wayne Rooney, rather than the frustrated looking Wayne Rooney that's been seen a bit in recent seasons.

Or on the other hand, will these new players ultimately push him out of the team, as his United career ends not with a bang, but a whimper?

746~~~
I think it could well bring the best out of him, hopefully anyway. It could also put his nose out of joint and make him angry and confused

747~~~
Having seen his stats on that Sky graphic yesterday, I'm willing to believe Rooney and Falcao can form a lovely partnership.

748~~~
I worry that that player has long gone and we'll never see him back to tell you the truth.  Genuinely can't remember the last time he went at defenders really.

749~~~
It's lack of fitness. Start of last season he was ace because he looked fit, got injured and came back lethargic and looking overweight. Still offers goals and quality though like that goal against West Ham.

750~~~
I'd say it's Rooney himself who most regards him as "the main man", and that's part of the problem; an ego that outweighs his ability. There's far too much time given to how to fit him in where he wants to play — usually at the expense of others — when it should just be conceded that he's not good enough to warrant special treatment. I'd hoped LVG would not succumb to reputations, but seemingly he has with Rooney as I get that same "undroppable" vibe I had with Moyes.

751~~~
Rooney's such an amazingly talented player, potentially I think he is a bit better than Falcao. He's only 4 or 5 months older than Radamel, who is an insanely talented footballer too. They both have some of their best years ahead of them and I'm pretty sure we will see spectacular moments from both.

752~~~
Rooney has never really struck a proper partnership with any striker. probably only with Saha. People might say tevez but that lasted only a handful of games before he was played more on the left. Will be interesting to see how it goes with falcao.

753~~~
Spot on, and the reason I would have preferred Rooney or RVP for that matter, to be offloaded, rather than Welbeck at the expense of bringing in Falcao. In a few years Welbeck will be coming into his prime whereas Rooney will have just deteriorated further. I firmly believe that Welbeck's all round game, except for his finishing/long range shooting is already superior to Rooney and once he can improve those two aspects of his game I believe he will have a lot more to offer to the team. As you said, technically he should be in his peak now but he looks like a shadow of his former self. The amount of times he has slowed up our build up play in the last 3 games, the gif above being a great example, is cringe-worthy. I wish I would be proven wrong too, because I loved the old Rooney. I also believe Welbeck would partner Falcao better than either Rooney or RVP will.

754~~~
I would say that on balance, the opposite has been true of Rooney's career at United. In that it's *him* who's been played out of position frequently to accommodate other plays, or fill gaps.

Has he got a strange voodoo hold over managers, do you think, including LvG? Or might it just be that he remains a much better player than some of you will currently give him credit for, and is picked on merit?

755~~~
You make a good point and it's hard to argue with. However, if Rooney keeps performing as he has in these past three games, in which he's been just as bad as players who are constantly criticized like Fletcher, Young and Valencia I don't see LVG keeping him in the starting line up for long.

756~~~
No it doesn't but a quick 1-2 there or a pass to RVP would have made a lot of sense.

757~~~
He's on the decline, get rid of him so that we're off his stupid wages.

758~~~
If we go by the first few games where he had no support, then we may as well throw away everybody. I think let's view him with better support before making any quick decisions.

759~~~
So what has Falcao done to warrant starting any games then?
Point is we bought him because of his quality performances as a 10 for dortmund, so we should have at least played him there for a few games consistently.
I don't think Fergie done much wrong with him given his injuries, but Moyes treatment of him (not even playing him when both Rooney and RVP were injured was a bit of a joke really)

760~~~
He has been since 2011/2012 since then he hasnt been top class. Not as a striker nor as a #10, 30 league goals since 2011/2012.. Embarassing.

761~~~
Are we really using goals as the only factor when he has spent few games as a striker in the last 3 years. He spent half of two seasons ago as a midfielder.

762~~~
To be honest, he should be able to see Di Marias run and he shouldn't even take a touch, the ball should have just been laid off to Di Marias path.
It is micro analysis though to be honest, many players will make these kind of mistakes in games.

However I think when people say Rooney tends to slow down our build up play this is what they mean, he doesn't seem to get his head up and asses the space before he receives the ball, its almost like he wants to get the ball under control and then have a look and pick out a pass, which at the highest level is the wrong way round.

EDIT: Also I would like to see him receive the ball, turn and take the defender on more often, but he needs to improve his first touch to do that effectively when the defender is tight.

763~~~
And there also he hasnt been good enough, most of his assists have been from set pieces further he doesnt do what we require from a #10, his control and creativity isnt good enough for that position, get rid.

764~~~
And I a not saying he should be a playmaker, I like Rooney as a second striker or a #9. My point is that I want to see how he performs with a better supporting class than run up the side and kick the ball at shins Valencia. At this point, we will really know how much Rooney has declined or not.

Last couple of years United team could make Messi look or Ronaldo look sub-par.

765~~~
He also hasnt been brilliant at England, top class players make their team better, Rooney doesnt.

766~~~
No one has been brilliant for England

767~~~

768~~~
Yeah because England doesnt have world class players. It could be Sturridge/Sterling in few years time tho.

769~~~
Even dross like Forren is taking shots at Rooney now?

770~~~
I actually think Rooney fitness wise looks good, he will always have a bulldogish shape. The worse he looked was after the last euro where he spent the whole month at the pub.

771~~~
Can he do this anymore though? He used to have space and strength to simply plow himself through, that combined with some simple but efficient dribbles. His pace looks long gone and his strength looks shattered also. I haven't seen him dribble past anyone in a long time either. I think it's his name that is world class these days.

772~~~
Pace has nothing to do with it, as RVP shows quite often (example his penalty appeal against Sunderland) if you have good technique and a brilliant first touch, you can take players on with skill and make space for yourself (of course if you don't have pace you can't run away from them) but you don't have to you can get a shot in / make a pass.

773~~~
As <a class="username" data-user="81416, @Cassidy" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81416/">@Cassidy</a> pointed out you don't really need pace if both your technique, weight shift and positioning are perfect. Falcao and RVP calculate every movement they make and they're so economical in the way they use the ball. You will see during the next few games most of the time Falcao turns away from the striker and positions himself and the ball for a shot with his first touch. Rooney just doesn't do that anymore. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Feg9vWc5DxY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Every movement is well thought out, nothing wasted and no hesitation. If van Gaal switches to a 4-3-3, I think it would be the end of Rooney as a number 9. He'll either take Mata's position in a midfield 3 or sit on the bench.

774~~~
If we swap to a 4-3-3 / 4-2-3-1 which most of the fans want then I don't see Rooney fitting in. Falcao and Van Persie are better #9's and Mata is a better #10.

775~~~
When was the last time Rooney actually had a good season? And by that, I don't mean a good few months here and there, but a consistently good full season. I'd probably say 2010 when he scored all those goals. Thats 4 years ago. Since then he's been forever patchy. Scores goals but just doesn't play consistently well. It has to be a concern. He's just not the player that defenders used to fear anymore.

776~~~
I think LVG will play him at #10. He seemed to make a big deal out of the captaincy so I don't think he'll drop Rooney anytime soon.

777~~~
No they haven't. And that's a scientific fact.

778~~~
Prove it then.

779~~~
Also do goals from set pieces count less? Why is it a bad thing that a lot of his assists come from set pieces?

780~~~
Yep, debunked that a long time ago. Not that it really matter though, it was still a pass.

781~~~
It only matters if you use assists as a measure for creativity (something that applies to open play)

782~~~
Watch the games and you'll see it. 'Proof' is there.

783~~~
He's even worse there. No creativity and only wants to be in the box for goals. If he is going to play it should be as a #9.

784~~~
Here's a video showing 13 of Rooney's league and CL assists from last season (which is, I think, pretty much all of them):

<a class="externalLink" href="http://tune.pk/video/3285413/wayne-rooney-goals-amp-assists-2013-2014" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://tune.pk/video/3285413/wayne-rooney-goals-amp-assists-2013-2014</a>

Three of them came from set-pieces, and the other ten came from through-balls, lay-offs and crosses (some very nice ones in there as well)

To put it another way, 76.9% of Rooney's assists in the league and Champions League *didn't* come from set pieces. So the statement 'most of his assists have been from set pieces' is an exact reversal of the truth.

But who are you going to believe? Sammyjun, or your lyin' eyes?

785~~~
For example some people might claim he is a better #10 than Mata due to his assists etc but if most of his assists came from set pieces then it doesn't matter where his position on the pitch is, if he's taking the free kicks and corners.
For the record I don't know the stats on his assists. The above is only an example.

786~~~
Rooney is still a very good players but has been on the decline for years now.

787~~~
Allright, you've proved me wrong havent you. But only these assists are really #10 assists when I watch that vid. The first RVP goal, I wouldnt call that an assist even, as RVP does it all literally all by himself. And 13 assists is already quite little imo for a #10, but if you cant that 10 assists were from open play and the first one RVP carries the ball away to the goal and smashes it, its 9 real assists in those competitions. Is that the amount we should expect from a 10 at United?

788~~~
I reckon that with the new signings Rooney is going to look even more slow than he does already......

789~~~
I know pace isn't everything in the game, but that was how Rooney would get past people - pace and power. Berbatov used brilliant first touches and dribbles, which RvP, although not quite as proficiently, also uses. Rooney has never been that kind of player, hence why I wrote that his loss of both pace and strength are a concern. In the past, he was nigh on impossible to shrug off the ball, now that seems far too easy, for instance.

790~~~
Take a shot at Rooney competition. First some Norwegian player nobody ever head of, than Parker, now the Daily Star.

791~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/premier-league/paul-parker-wayne-rooney-is-being-paid-300k-a-week-to-play-badly-30558839.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.ie/sport/soc...-paid-300k-a-week-to-play-badly-30558839.html</a>

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> walk away from the computer. Should have stopped typing after that first sentence...

793~~~
Anyone else disappointed that a certain bit of selfishness has crept into his game recently? The managers used to love him for his selflessness and willingness to work for the team at times at his own expense but he's slowly been moving away from that attitude.

794~~~

Rooney finding Valencia, in Ecuador.

795~~~
Been rubbish tonight. I know they're only friendlies, but he should still be performing so much better. Just look at how well Di Maria is playing against Germany. Rooney doesn't need to be as good as that, but he should at least look competent. Right now he doesn't.

796~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

797~~~
World class. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He was as bad for us if not worse during the opening 3 games of the season. I hope he's not doing a Torres and turning into shit in a single season. With the signings of Falcao and Di Maria and future signings of similar quality he will be made to look even more average. Mind you, many will still remember him for the 10 good games a season he has and say he's world class.

798~~~
I haven't seen a footballer that gets away with being so shit for most of the time like Wayne Rooney. Even his peeks aren't even that good anymore and when he's rubbish he's not even EPL material.

SAF was right about him.

799~~~
I wouldn't call him shit just yet, but it is increasingly looking like he's on a downward trend.

800~~~
Even when he's at been at his very best for United, he's managed to look shit for England. But yeah, let's take his performance today as yet another reason to twist the knife in.

801~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

802~~~
4 or five games.......not half a season

803~~~
Worryingly, I thought he stuck out like a sore thumb for the England attack today, and not in a good way. Sterling, Sturridge and Ox looked much much better players. He just constantly lost the ball. I think he's a busted flush in all honesty, and we've seen the best of Wayne.

804~~~
And if he is criticised they will say we 'hate' him.

He, and his army of blind defenders, are finding it increasingly difficult to explain why he walks into the team for club and country by default.

England demonstrates clearly the issue I have with Wayne Rooney. We are not talking about Lionel Messi here, why can he not be dropped? Sturridge is ahead as the 9 and Sterling is clearly superior as the 10. The choice is straightforward. We will have similar issues at United.

805~~~
He's just so uninspiring at times. Worrying for our captain.

806~~~
Rooney should retire from England. England needs a new scapegoat.

807~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Sep/vote-for-your-august-player-of-the-month.aspx?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...=facebook&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd</a>

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This is embarassing.

808~~~
At times he struggles with the absolute basics of football, controlling and shielding the ball.

809~~~
Rooney needs to be dropped for Club and Country. He simply isn't good enough at the moment.

810~~~
I think the best thing for Rooney would be to stay up top and not be involved in the play at all and hence escape criticism.

811~~~
Problem for club and country. 

And he is captain for both.

812~~~
Must be all those clueless managers, right? Roy Hodgson, Louis Van Gaal...

813~~~
There was a reason Fergie wanted rid, he knew he was done. Now we're stuck with him for the next 4 years on £300K p/w.

814~~~
Why should he escape criticism? He is taking the piss with these performances of late.

815~~~
I don't think there is another supposedly "top" player who can look as bad as Rooney when it comes to losing the basics of football.

816~~~
They're including pre-season, as you can see if you actually read what you linked to. Slim pickings for player of the month, obviously, but it's getting boring the way United fans will use any possible excuse to slag off the club captain.

817~~~
Oh, that stupid argument again. The age old 'are you saying you know more than Fergie?'.

Perhaps you're right, only an idiot from the internet like me would have Sterling ahead of Rooney in the 10 role. I imagine I should return to Football Manager now right?

818~~~
The difference between him and lets say Sturridge becomes clearer every week, he does literally nothing good with the ball and brings it back all the time. Its time for him to be dropped.

819~~~
He's not really a 'top' player anymore though. He's been living off his name and reputation for a good few years now.

820~~~
Now you mention it...

821~~~
Mata and Van Persie have both been worse than him and yet it's the Rooney thread that gets bumped up even while his first misplaced pass of the match is still midair. With Cleverley gone, looks like United fans have found a new scapegoat.

822~~~
Right.

823~~~
This is why I used inverted comas.

824~~~
He's fecked and everyone knows it. Spends too many games playing like a pub league player and occasionally has his moments of brilliance in games. World class is out the window, top class is questionable now

825~~~
Sterling is better when he is played out wide.

826~~~
Sterling is in much better form right now. Play him in the hole and Sturridge up front. Rooney to the left or the bench.

827~~~
He was absolutely dreadful tonight as he has been for Utd so far this season. He just looks so slow and lethargic, I've been wanting him dropped for Utd when the international break is finished but I'm not even sure he deserves to be starting for England any more either.

His penalty was good at least.

828~~~
Some people take a dig at him for tedious reasons but don't you agree that he seems to have declined as a footballer? I am not sure what is wrong either.

829~~~
He was poor in the build up tonight, slowed everything down as if he was still playing with Mata and RVP.

830~~~
Think you've just answered your own question with that one <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

831~~~
Rooney looked good in pre season when he had a good team around him. I reckon he'll be back to his best when our players return from injury and we start creating more in the final third.

832~~~
Yet some fans give out to other fans for criticising him.
Falcao is a better striker than Rooney and Mata and Januzaj are better #10's. Ya have to admit that Rooney is putting in some pretty poor performances recently and they are becoming more frequent.

833~~~
I don't understand how someone as talented as Rooney can sometimes play the game like its completely foreign to him. His first touch is dreadful at times and he slows down so many attacks. Its almost as if he's out of energy as he starts the game.

834~~~
It's just kinda painful to see that after his transfer requests, his sub par performances for over 2 years now, bar a few months in 2013, that he simply isn't that good anymore and still on a huge contract. We could've easily gotten rid of him in 2013. Rooneys time is over, Scholes and SAF were right about him and honestly it saddens me to see him in this state already. I mean the explosive Rooney has gone years ago, but he still was a world class striker. Now he is just a goodish striker, that lives of his great reputation.

835~~~
Has Mata really been any better there? Rooney would be criticised for putting in Mata-esque performances. And Januzaj definitely isn't a better #10 either. And as for Falcao being a better striker, let's just see how he's playing after the injury and how he adjusts to the league before we decide he's better than Rooney and Rvp?

836~~~
Fergie too. Because Rooney has never actually been any good. They've all been duped. His loveable scouse charm has fooled 'em all into playing him, despite the fact he can't play football. Fergie finally realized it, though - after ten years or so, Rooney having nearly cost us multiple trophies (but we managed to scrape through, in spite of his obvious ineptness). Moyes (not having consulted Fergie) was brain dead, though, and personally made sure we gave him a new five year contract. Which forced the typically timid and passive Louis Van Gaal to make the horrible cnut captain of our team. 

He will be the death of United one of these days, the signs have been there (in spite of us winning the league for fun, winning a CL final and featuring in two more) from the day he arrived.

837~~~
Absolute gash, I don't care if he's captain if he isn't performing then he shouldn't start.

838~~~
Barely a few weeks back he was looking great in pre-season. Slim, fit and scoring and creating brilliant goals. A few games later he's not played well in three games as part of a misfiring club team (along with other quality players) and has one quiet game for England. The desperation that United fans have to write his obituary as a footballer is fvcking mental, it really is.

839~~~
He obviously isn't though. He played his best stuff last season in the hole. Which culminated in him starting the WC there and being England's best player against Italy, yet being shifted the following game because everyone insisted that it was not an arrangement that works best for Rooney. 

If the team was picked on merit, and by merit, I don't mean what you have done years ago, I mean merit in the sense of what has made Cahill a regular over the last year or got Stones a cap tonight - Rooney would be a sub. The embarrassing thing about it is that everyone knows it now. All the media are saying it, while some are politely saying in, but not saying it. Then there is a section of United fans who have devised a theory that Rooney is actually outstanding and his name has probably been drawn out of a hat as England's scapegoat , and has nothing at all to do with his actual performances.

840~~~
Erm, no they are not. Even if they are(and they aren't), there was just one preseason game in august(notice the player of the month-august in the tittle), vs Valencia, and he was  pretty average in that game too.

841~~~
Pretty insane he got both armbands really. He seems to be keeping himself fit due to it, but his game isn't fully there, he's like some odd false10 or whatever type player in both systems that don't really want it. I dunno. Clubwise at least, he would of probably helped himself and United going to Chelsea last summer, not that I, even realising that, wanted him to go there.

Might of helped his England career too as Jose would of made the central focal point alone, so would probably be a straight battle for whoever goes in for England on whos scored the most between him and Sturridge.

842~~~
He's past it.

843~~~
Regardless of his form in pre fecking season, whether you think he is rubbish or not , it surely cannot be argued that he has been a worse footballer than Sturridge and Sterling for about 12 months, more so in Sturridge's case?

Can you hand on heart say your strong defence of Rooney is based purely on saying what you see?

844~~~
And if Rooney scores an important goal or two on Monday against Switzerland there will be very little activity on this thread.

845~~~
They specifically mention pre-season games in the blurb about him. Like I said, it's been a horrendous month so they're obviously stretching. At the very least he's scored our best goal (one of only two in competitive games) Who would you have as your three nominees?

846~~~
Sterling and Sturridge <i>have</i> been better than him for at least 12 months now. They've also been miles better than RVP, Mata and Januzaj. Are all four United players really that much worse than the Liverpool two? Or perhaps the confidence that comes playing for a club side that's absolutely flying (as opposed to slowly dying on it's arse) might have something to do with it?

EDIT: Sturridge was worse than Rooney in the WC, mind you. He was absolutely shite IMO.

847~~~
Mata is a better #10 than Rooney. He is creative and a joy to watch. Rooney's touch has been awful recently and his passing has massively degressed. Even though Mata may have been poor so far this season, he has just had a poor start. He was very good last season. Rooney was quite poor last season. I can tell you are a Rooney fan from your username so I can't see you agreeing with me on anything here.

848~~~
I don't want to make this a Rooney vs RvP debate but since he's the only other striker at the club currently who has played games for us, I'll use him as a comparison. What do United fans want? Would they be happy if he were like RvP and be completely out of the game when not having a good match (which has happened quite often for RvP in recent times) or would you rather he drop deep and try things, many of which might not work, and just generally try be involved. Rooney looked very sharp for us in pre season but has had a poor two games for the club since the season started at a time where our entire team has been dreadful and yet the knives seem to be out earlier than usual. It seems a bit OTT.

849~~~
RVP's form went tits up when Rooney came back into the fold under Moyes and he even publicly brought it up after the game vs Olympiakos. The problem with Mata (and you can include Kagawa in this) is with Rooney on the pitch they occupy the same space, Rooney no longer has pace or looks to run in behind defences so Mata has no one offering penetrating runs. To get the best out of these 10's you need forwards capable of stretching play.

850~~~
He really wasn't but. He was our best player till Christmas and was then just as good (or poor) as anyone else in the squad for the second half of the season. I know stats don't tell the story but he did finish in double digits for both goals and assists last season. At a time when everyone has been atrocious, Rooney gets a disproportionate share of the blame largely because of his new contract and now proabably the captaincy.

851~~~
I don't understand people using his preseason performances in his favor, Fletcher looked like Scholes in America and that mattered to nothing once the team showed up back home.

852~~~
They mentioned it for every player but they "bolded" at the start that they are talking just about four games; mentioning "start of the season vs Swansea" in every players section.

 I have no idea, but obviously not him because he was probably one of our worse performers. Smalling wasn't bad, even Ashley Young was probably better than him, and Valencia was equally bad, same as Mata, but he obviously got the nomination on his name.

853~~~
How come the other 'poor' players get dropped yet Rooney never does. As for the Mata vs Rooney debate. There is no way that Rooney could be considered a better #10. Come on! Van Persie and Falcao are better striker too.

854~~~
So it's all Rooney's fault the rest of them are playing badly? Seems legit. 

This place. Honestly...

855~~~
You can't rate any of our players based on last 12 months. If you do you can say all our players are shit and we know that is not the case. And you can't rate Rooney based on England games because emm England are pretty shit to.

Give time to Rooney, RVP and Mata and start comparing them to Liverpool players when our team start clicking.

856~~~
That's interesting, Mata just had a poor start, but Rooney didnt, he's been poor the whole last season right? Problem is, he wasnt, he was very good in the beginning of the season and Mata on the other hand wasnt much better last season.
But you obviously see things different.

The whole team was poor last season but Rooney is always blamed for everything by some.

857~~~
I think if Rooney is playing he should stick to playing up front as an out and out striker instead of dropping deep and trying to make things happen because as you said most of the time it doesn't work and he just gets in the way. I don't think he's good enough to be a number 10 for Utd anymore, his first touch, control and passing aren't good enough and he seems too timid and cautious to try anything out of the ordinary anyway. Other than his weekly crap effort at chipping the keeper.

 I'm sure he's doing it to try and help out and that's admirable but more often than not it doesn't work.

858~~~
End of the day, this 'witchhunt' stuff is crap in my view. The eye sees what the eye sees.

Nobody likes Suarez but his supporters are not constantly having to defend his status as a top footballer.  Rooney is not being called out for no reason.  If he was unequivocally excellent more often than not, this debate would not keep happening.

859~~~
Rooney is now England's 4th all time leading scorer.

860~~~
Mata was very good when he arrived last year. Yet Rooney was struggling all season by his standards as you said along with the rest of the United squad. My point is that Mata is a better #10 than Rooney, which I can see no room for debate there. Rooney is a striker and should only be played there imo. However now I think Falcao is a better striker so by my book Rooney should be benched.

861~~~
The logic behind some of these arguments is interesting. Or appalling. Or completely absent. Depends on one's point of view, I suppose.

Anyway, Rooney isn't really a problem for us at the moment. I honestly don't think so. 

Good night.

862~~~
Although I'm a big fan of him, Mata wasn't anything special when he arrived really.

863~~~
When has RvP been dropped? When has Mata been dropped? The two of them have had as many, if not more, poor games off late and they don't get dropped either. 
Well then the eye should see with more consistency and less bias because if it were consistent, we'd be seeing some of our other big names also get the criticism Rooney gets. Maybe Rooney ought to just completely not be in the match like RvP and then we'll move on to the next scapegoat.

864~~~
And our third all time top scorer. He was, is and will be WC player. Just look at his stats.

865~~~
Darren Fletcher looked good in pre season. That says it all pretty much

866~~~
All those who are saying Falcao is a better striker etc, have you even watched him play anytime recently or are you all just going by his pre Monaco form from 2 years ago? He wasn't great at Monaco and he's just come back from major injury so there's no real guarantee that he's going to be better than RvP and Rooney just because he was amazing two seasons ago.

867~~~
Stats kinda bore me to be honest with you.  One thing though: what's he ever done in a World Cup?  Not having a go, but surely that's the benchmark for a truly world class player, right?

868~~~
Falcao played 20 games for Monaco, and already scored some goals in preseason. 
Sure there's no guarantee he'll be his old self but he is a better striker than Rooney tbh.

869~~~
No plenty of players took blame for last season which resulted in Rio/Evra/Vidic/Cleverly/Nani/Buttner/Kagawa all being shown the door. Like half of them Rooney isn't good enough anymore and should have been shown the exit as well. 

Rooney was very poor in SAF last season so much so he wanted him sold, he's done nothing since then to show SAF was wrong quite the opposite. At no point in any of my posts have I based an argument on England performances.

870~~~
What about WC players with crap national teams for instance then? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

871~~~
Hardly. Unless you think Messi only just became world class this summer.

872~~~
Brilliant revisionism.

873~~~
Really, I thought Rooney asked for a transfer?

874~~~
You could say the same about Rooney to be fair. What's to say he's going to improve and be as good as he was at even nearly his best? At least Falcao is still scoring.

875~~~
Well, he'd won his fair share of individual honours at club level prior to that so yeah, slow starter at international level.  And stats concerning goals bore me really... sure Robbie Keane is one of the all time leading international goalscorers, right?  Yeah, Robbie Keane... gas.

876~~~
The tenses! The tenses!!!

877~~~
Rooney was poor in Fergie's last season though. Poor enough that he was dropped for the biggest game of the season.

Is that not a universally accepted opinion?

878~~~
Its a borderline crime how much we're paying him and now that he's our captain.

He's our third best no.9 and I'd much rather play three players in no.10 ahead of him, heck that's not even including the one player we recently sold who I rate as a better no.10.

Wish he'd be dropped instead of being picked on default, its becoming as a tedious as the Gerrard sentimentality for England.

879~~~
Rooney scored 19 goals in 37 appearances last season. Falcao scored around 11 in 19 for Monaco? Hardly a major difference considering the former is considered beyond his expiry date and Falcao is the best striker in the world.

880~~~
He scored the opening goals in the most important league match of the season and started every other important match of the season.

881~~~
Absolutely not.

Not a great argument...

882~~~
Goals are kind of a big deal in football but each to his own. 

Keane's a better striker than a lot of people are willing to give him credit for. A bit like Rooney. So they've got that in common. Along with all the goals.

883~~~
I know. If only I mentioned another manager in there...

884~~~
God, don't get me started on Keane too!  We'll agree to disagree I think.

I think people are being unrealistic when they state which pairing we will choose to play regularly. Even if one of them shows to be slightly better together we will continue to use all of them.

We have three world class player for two positions and all the possible combinations will create a pairing with its own weaknesses and strengths.

The one rule that will apply is that if one of them hits a great run of form then he will be a certain starter for that duration.

Falcao and RVP: Certainly is the tactically best by a mile. They will provide the most penetrative runs, the most pure goal scoring and on the defense they will again play their role brilliantly.

This partnership would be popular if we replace the defensively weak Mata with Di Maria in the AM position.

I think it would be popular when we are playing teams we are very superior to as well, but then with Mata still there.

Rooney and Falcao: The most different pairing. Rooney is a playmaking and hard working striker who will be everywhere on the pitch. Falcao is a pure goal scorer. Rooney is the best defensively and runs the most of our strikers.

We will see it when we need a good defense as Rooney helps out Mata more than the other striker options would.

Rooney and RVP: Probably the worst combination as they are very similar. Hopefully LVG decides to give them slightly differing roles with Rooney trying to link up out wide or by falling down and by telling RVP to stay inside the box.

Naturally they are too similar and they don't really click as a partnership. When one drops, the other doesn't make a run because it is so unclear when the link up "drop" will be made and by who.

The only thing that can't ever happen as a striker duo is that you both fall down at the same time to offer the link up play. If both makes runs it is okay, if one falls and the other makes a run its brilliant, if one falls and the other stands still its okay.

886~~~
I was joking mate.

887~~~
I know. You were the second person to do that though. Can only restrain my inner smart-arse for so long!

888~~~
What arguments, exactly? In regards to his first touch, control and passing, you know, the basics, much of the criticisms are warranted and have been for some time. He isn't a #10 and he has no right to be playing there.

I don't think he is a 'problem' for us at club level, but I do think the England team could benefit from allowing four younger, faster, more dynamic players to take up the mantle and play in that front four.

889~~~
Yeah and didn't play very well in any of them so he was dropped for the Madrid game. After which it seemed like Fergie started the process of phasing him out with a view to getting rid in the summer.

That was the season where he turned up at Everton genuinely looking out of shape and unfit. The 2012/2013 was his worst at Utd I think.

890~~~
It really is pointless arguing with some Rooney supporters. I have my favourites too but I don't let that cloud my judgement.
Instead of becoming irate and even insulting why don't they just look at his performances for what they are without saying that others have been just as bad or worse.
Its plain to see that Rooney is not playing well. One can argue the length of his poor form but to continue to make excuses for him is just simply silly.

891~~~
I think I'm with you on Keane actually. He's not as shite as people make out but when he's not getting on the end of stuff in the box he's a passenger. Nothing else to his game. The white Darren Bent. 

Rooney's cut from different cloth but yeah, will agree to disagree.

892~~~
True, but you know, a striker - not to mention a good striker for what is supposed to be a good team - will score goals. Doesn't mean he's the best player for the role at the club. Van Nistelrooy scored tons, but we got to a stake when using Saha, who wasn't as good as scorer but was quicker and had different abilities, was better for the team.

I just don't know with Rooney. He'll always pop up with something special here and there, but I'm not sure that covers how poor he can be for quite substantial periods. He'll always get you goals and assists because he's a good player, but should he still be a focal point for United? When we see the problems we have in attack, is he part of the solution or part of the problem? And even if it's not the latter, does our best solution include him? I honestly have big doubts there.

893~~~
He hasn't been great. I don't know if he's been told to stay up top, but he isn't getting on the ball enough. 

Today he was man marked the entire game and frankly it was a piece of piss doing it as he barely moved. Sturridge was constantly on the move, asking for the ball and making sure he got it. 

He hasn't developed any sort of partnership with Sturridge or RvP. I don't think he ever will except for the odd occasion.

894~~~
SAF did his best to give him the boot by announcing publicly he'd asked for a move then Rooney demanded an apology from SAF claiming he'd never handed in a transfer request.

895~~~
Did I say he should play as a number 10? No, I did not. I said good night. And I repeat it: Good fecking night.

896~~~
For a so called world class talent his ratio of poor to good/great performances is shocking.

897~~~
Apparently there are "appalling" arguments in this thread, I'm curious as to where they are. You can sit at your computer making sarcy comments all night but the stark reality is that the observations regarding the consistency of Rooney's touch, control and passing are all correct and very fair.

People aren't just making it up. Rooney is a phenomenal goalscorer, but if people want to cover their eyes and ears and just pretend as if his all round is as good as it should be then they're only fooling themselves.

My comment about him playing at #10 was just my own opinion. I wasn't implying you indicated anything to do with that topic.

And yeah, good night.

898~~~
100% agree with this. I've said it before, if LVG plays him in that #10 role I'd be gobsmacked. I'd even go as far as to say if we play a 4-3-3 then I wouldn't have him in the starting eleven. There are better suited players for any position that he plays in.

899~~~
I'm not just talking about this season which is three games old. I am including last season. When RVP and Rooney played together last season. Rooney was the #10 and he was poor there. People were constantly asking for Kagawa to come in instead of him. Mata hasn't played that many games but Giggs did drop him. RVP has been injured a lot last season which means he wasn't available to start or be dropped. However a year and half ago RVP won us the league single handedly which is a lot more than what Rooney ahs done for us recently.

900~~~
From what I've seen this season, Rooney has to adapt his game for me now. I think his days as a striker seem numbered and if he wants to continue playing at the top level he has to be willing to change his game. You don't really fancy him in a foot race with quick players anymore and he seems to get muscled quite easily by top centre backs. If he drops into a deeper role then I can still see him being effective. He can still spot a pass, he can still shoot and finish well and he does seem to have the stamina to run a full 90 minutes. 

Maybe he is still to trying to regain his full fitness and he is not 100% for some reason but it just looks very bleak for him.

901~~~
His decline is inevitable. It's like a great band. When they are raw, young and creative they make great albums. Time, money, and the world eventually catch up to them but they continue to make professional & respectable music, because people will still buy the records and the concert tickets. They recognize the band's name and the songs are familiar but the performance is nothing like it was during the early days. Rooney's basically on the football equivalent of a reunion tour. Huge money for uninspired performance. In short, he has become what he loves. An old prostitute.

903~~~
More Rooney criticism I take it lads?

904~~~
Typical Rooney performance tonight. Awful most of the time, losing the ball, horrible touches, hollywood balls, slowing down play, no movement etc but bags a goal. Thats what you get from wayne and thats what we will continue to get probably.

His ratio of good to average/poor games must be horrendous nowadays.

905~~~
Well thank god we have a world class manager with 20 years experience of managing top teams and the very best football players and not you lot.

906~~~
Here I was, reading your post thinking you had put so much thought into it (not that I agree with you), but then I got to that last bit and it cracked me up <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

907~~~
Only saw the first half hour or so, but Rooney was quite shit, like an increasing amount of Rooney's performances nowadays. Sloppy passing, bad first touch, generally not up to scratch. 

No doubt though is numbers will be good this season, as per, but his general play is getting worse and worse it seems.

908~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Nicely done sir.  Nearly choked on my tea.

909~~~
Amazing post <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

910~~~
Genuinely laughed.

911~~~
Taking all the the 'sides' away, all the Rooney 'haters' all his 'defenders', taking all the bullshit away, contracts, captaincy, not thinking about any prejudice against him for previous indiscretions...the truth is...I miss the old Rooney. I really genuinely do. I loved watching him play. The power, the pace, the unpredictability. He was a joy to watch. And he just isn't anymore, in fact, aesthetically speaking he's probably one of the least exciting players nowadays. Yes, he's capable of the odd moment of genius still, a killer pass, a beautiful goal, but they're few and far between now. His play is boring, its predictable, its just stale. 

He'll continue to rack up the stats, because he's still a good player, but he's not ever going to be the great player he once was. He's lost to much of what made that player so fantastic. And its a shame.

912~~~
I just saw a video from when he scored a hattrick against Bolton in '07, and his finishing was sublime. I know he was on a goal drought before that game, but I don't think anyone will disagree with me when I say his finishing doesn't seem anywhere near as good as that now a days - or at least not as consistent.

913~~~
His finishing is far better now than it was then but his overall play is definitely worse and less consistent. He doesn't score those sort of goals anymore because he doesn't have that electric speed he once had to get in behind defenders.

914~~~
Yep although it almost impossible to keep that style up and then add the way Rooney looks after his body it was never going to last. But as you say there's still moments of genius there and unlike any other player I've seen when's he's good he's very good but when he's bad he's... well you get the point,there is no middle ground.

It's all or nothing with Wayne and it's been like that for a good few years.

Still at moment I'm not expecting anything from him as like the rest of the United their are still in the trial and error stage with Van Gaal ideas.

915~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I agree with you - he only turns it on when contract time comesa round (like early last season before he extended).

916~~~
Maybe the question should be directed to non United England fans. Rooney got a goal for them today, despite by all accounts, another sub par performance. Is it still in the team's best interest to have him?

917~~~
From the England fans I know it's pretty evenly split. Some don't think he's good enough to start and would have him on the bench while others think he's our best player and should start every game. The latter is where quite a lot of journalists and pundits stand, though I think that's starting to change with some.

918~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Perfectly sums Rooney up, well done, I couldn't have said it in better words

919~~~
The problem is that his passing can be really inconsistent. His short passing in particular is very hit and miss. He needs to get his form back and fast.

920~~~
So, similar to United's situation then. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Except England don't have Mata, Di Maria, Falcao and Van Persie.

921~~~
What has C.Ronaldo ever done in WC?

922~~~
I don't think Rooney is past it, although he certainly has to work really hard to get back to his best.  He needs to up his game in a lot of areas.

I think Falcao coming in will be really good for Rooney.  Falcao and RvP both being here means that Rooney should not be undroppable - I know he is our captain but I expect van Gaal would drop him if he felt Rooney wasn't performing to the required standard and there are genuine world class alternatives in better form...van Gaal is stubborn but not an idiot.  Simply, Rooney has to knuckle down, work hard and improve or else he will find himself the one kicking his heels on the bench, whereas before he has mostly played no matter how poor his form due to him being significantly better than his alternatives. 

It will be beneficial for Rooney to be removed from the firing line when he isn't playing well and it should hopefully make him eager to fight to get his place back.  If he continues to get picked by van Gaal despite playing poorly with any of Falcao/RvP/Mata on the bench then both he and van Gaal will receive a lot of criticism, and quite rightly so.

923~~~
If he's crap for us, I think he will be dropped. I realise he's our captain... but LVG isn't going to persist when there are other players waiting in the wings. That goes for any one of our attacking players now.

924~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

For me Rooney is finished as a top level player in terms of performance.. i.e. he is not a 'star player'. He is very similar to Mata in that he is capable of producing good stats in terms of assists/goals, but he is a hindrance for both both club and country due to his lack of mobility.

For England he is an utter nightmare, I predict they will flop at Euro 2016 and possible world cup 2018, and then once wayne retires... the likes of Sturridge might be on the wane and the whole cycle begins again. England needed a manager who just focused on youth development and building an attractive brand of football, instead we've got Fat waz at the heart of it all - making the rest look shite. Scoring the pen, means he can end up looking good as he scored the goal.. but his performance was piss poor yesterday.

He looked good in pre-season, but that is the problem with Rooney... he can still look good in patches but when was the last time he ran a game from start to finish, week in week out in a United shirt? he never turned into that player we thought he could who dominates games and the other team has to adjust their tactics to stop his threat.. it has never materialised. It is very easy to mark him out the game as he is predictable when running with the ball and doesn't have brilliant movement off the ball to compensate for it. Instead he comes short.. drops a shoulder and plays a pass out wide. Rinse and repeat.

The problem for me is at United, RVP and Mata are no better, so in that case.. Rooney still has some use for United at the moment.. whereas for England, he needs to go in order for Sterling/Barkley to flourish as he is in direct competition with them and nowhere near as good. Selling him to Chelsea would have been perfect, Short term hit but long term gain.

I wouldn't be surprised to see Rooney, RVP and Mata go after next summer... their lack of dynamism just doesn't fit into LVGs footballing philosophy and if we have shitloads of money and are capable of attracting stars like Di Maria, we don't need to put up with this substandard level performance from either of these players anymore.

925~~~
The difference is at England.. Sturridge is easily a better player, younger, faster, hungrier and more technically gifted. Then you have the likes of Sterling and Barkley who are the same in the number 10 spot. Even Roy tried to drop him in the world cup before Rooney had a sulk during the Italy game and then Hodgson pandered to him.

Our best performance in recent times was dropping Rooney against Real, we really took it to them and were so energetic that night.

At United now, in terms of competition... RVP, Mata.. they're not that much better than Rooney in terms of affecting the pace of the game or even in terms of end product. Therefore he still has a role to play. I hope by bringing in more talent, this will no longer remain the case.

926~~~
Your giving Sturridge far too much credit. More technically gifted? Rooney just needs to be playing in a confident team again.

927~~~
He's obviously going to be dropped if he's not performing. Van Gaal's reputation is built entirely on having the bollocks to make tough decisions and drop players whose reputation exceeds their contribution on the pitch. Rooney's obviously made a good first impression in training and in pre-season (so our new manager obviously sees qualities in him that many on here do not) but anyone who thinks Van Gaal won't drop Rooney if he's not producing is living in la la land. Especially now he's got Van Persie <b>and</b> Falcao both playing the same position.

So let's wait and see what happens. If Rooney keeps getting picked then maybe, just maybe, the witch-hunt in this thread is based more on emotion than a rational analysis of what he does on the football pitch. Time will tell...

928~~~
Oh and on a purely physiological level this idea that any footballer  - in the absence of serious injury - has suddenly entered a phase of rapid physical decline aged 28 is fecking demented.

929~~~
Clearly he isn't in physical decline. Why he's stopped using his physical gifts is what's concerning. He still has rapid acceleration and good strength. He still has the ability to beat a man or 2. But he uses these sporadically. I just hope its a confidence issue cuz there is no other explanation for it.

I still maintain that making him club and country captain was an absolutely unnecessary burden, especially when both of these teams are in crap form.

930~~~
Plus, both these teams may look to prosper without him in the side in the near future - becomes awkward for the manager, possibly.

931~~~
Seems the most logical explanation, with so many other players at the same club playing way below what we know they're capable of. If anything, Rooney's had one or two spells in the last 12 months that were closer to his best than anyone else at United. Yet he's been getting the most stick. Go figure.

Fair point about the captaincy. Can go one of two ways, I suppose. Still very early days this season, for club and country.

932~~~
Why United didn't sell him to Real for say 60m or why did they bought Mata is a mystery to me..

933~~~
Probably not true.

934~~~
Not even Real are that crazy. Everyone but a few in denile United supporters know Rooney's in decline. Hell even Scholes implied it.

935~~~
1st paragraph is 100% spot on!
When he became Dutch national manager, he dropped RVP as he wasn't impressed. RVP obviously changed his mind as LVG made him captain and now, LVG loves the guy. 

The 2nd paragraph...Maybe for some but, for me, it's not so much as a witch hunt but, describing what I see anytime he plays these days and sadly, there isn't much positive to report lately

936~~~
That's far from clear. Just watch Rooney against Arsenal away 2010 and watch him against Arsenal away 2014 and you'll see a sea of difference. Rooney has played in one of the physically most demanding leagues for 12 years now. It's not unreasonable to suggest thta he's lost some of his qualities. It's pretty obvious that he isn't particularly quick and explosive any more. His limited ability to get past players ins't somethng new, that's a tendency from 2-3 seasons now.

937~~~
I agree with this assessment, you certain players, when losing their most important physical attributes, change their game to use their "brain" more. I think Rooney tries to play like he's his physical peak but he just cannot anymore. Running up and down the pitch isn't helping him, hopefully with a better midfield he won't have to anymore and focus his energy in the last third of the pitch.

938~~~
For all the talk of van Persie's form by United fans for me the biggest worry is Rooney. He's had a nice full pre-season and should be in tip top shape right now but he isn't. He looks lethargic and heavy legged already. There's no spring in his step, very poor movement, poor first touch and passing is well off.

939~~~
Sturridge is far more technically gifted at present, he can dribble the ball in a manner Rooney could only dream of... shoots off either foot from varying distances at a regular basis, even his hold up play is progressing beyond what Rooney is capable of.

Don't get me wrong, a peak Rooney.. > Sturridge, but this current Rooney? only a biased Rooney fan would say he is more talented than Sturridge in his current guise. Technically Sturridge is one of the best strikers in football, his footwork alone is ahead of most strikers.. he is more like a winger in that respect. All Rooney can pull off is dropping the shoulder to make a pass.

940~~~
Absolutely horrendous viewing

941~~~
I have to say, the current Wayne Rooney is a bit of a mess.

We're paying him more than probably any other player in the squad. We're paying absolute top dollar, because of him holding the club to ransom on two occassions. 

And what does he deliver?

Arguably, he's gone downhill entirely since his great 09/10 season where he was played as a pure striker. 

Bar the 11/12 season he's not delivered. The last couple of years hasn't been anywhere near the standard required from a player like him.

Quite frankly, his bottom level and consistency are shameful considering what he's paid.

It annoys me greatly.

942~~~
I think Wayne Rooney is worth the money he's getting. If you look at the brand Wayne Rooney you can't compare it with any other active player today in England. This alone brings an interest and carisma that every club need.

If we look at the player he will always be uneven in his performance. SAF said so himself that Wayne takes too long to get into shape whenever he's not on a strikt diet and won't get to play a lot. And we can all see he's the player that has the biggest weight spread during a single year - something you can easily tell with your eyes. Once we get closer to november-december he will hit his form.

To me Wayne Rooney was always going to be a better player when the tempo is extreme. He's the kind of player that need a high puls and act on intuition rather than taking a decision when there's no pressure whatsoever. I believe LVG will upper our speed a bit in the final third on counter attacks and limit the time from build up to execution. Players like Valencia, Young and Cleverley (I know he's gone now) are just too slow in that area, so hopefully we will be deadlier and create stuff at a higher speed from now on, and this is where Wayne will come good I believe.

943~~~
Rooney has never looked after himself the way other top pro's who maintained a high level into their 30's have. He never had blistering pace or regularly went past defenders with ease anyway so even a moderate decline has left him looking completely out of place. Last night England fans got to see what we witness from him every week. Incapable of making penetrating runs, linking play, beating defenders etc  Last night he had fewest passes of any England outfield player, the lowest pass completion of any England outfield player, the fewest touches of any England outfield player.

He may get by with England because they don't have RVP/Falcao/Mata but we do.

944~~~
This pass kills me. I can't remember watching a more predictable 'top' player.

945~~~
Good post

It does seem like slowly but surely Rooney's low quality performances are starting to get noticed more in the media. As little as a year ago he was seen as our best player and someone that England should build the team around where as the media don't seem as strong in their praise now. We're starting to hear the first rumblings of people wanting him dropped.

He gets criticised more than most because he's our highest paid player and he's twice held the club to ransom. I don't get why some people don't understand why Rooney is disliked by a section of Utd fans. You are perfectly entitled to disagree with those people who dislike him but surely you can see why?

I think he's still capable of the odd moment of quality but those moments get further and further apart now. And in between those moments of quality is a lot of dross.

946~~~
I think if you reduce his workload and ( a la Welbeck) just play him as one of two CFs or as left sided attacker you get the best from him. I think his forays into number 10 land just make it all too much for him, on a few levels.

947~~~
He's 28.  So enough of this "into their 30s" crap. At 28 you don't get any footballer undergoing even a "moderate decline" based purely on their age. 

Repeated muscular injuries can take their toll (e.g. michael owen). Other than that, any perceived physical decline is purely in the head of the observer. 

He was crap for England last night. No arguments here. As Van Gaal himself said, he needs to get over this burden of captaincy, relax and start expressing himself. Right now, it seems to be inhibiting him. Hopefully this won't take more than a few games.

948~~~
No, no it isn't. Just because you disagree with an idea doesn't make that idea "demented". The fact is Rooney will be 29 in a few weeks and has played 12 years of first team football. He's played over 600 games for club and country. I think you're greatly discounting the clumative effect of playing that many games. Honestly how many players are any where near their peak after that many games. Beckham heading to MLS by the time he'd played as many games as Rooney. It wasn't 'til 2008-09 that Scholes had that many games under his belt. Not to mention injuries (I've lost count of the number of times he's injured the same foot/ankle). Scholes wasn't being a WUM when he wrote about the very real possibility that Rooney has peaked and is now on the decline.

949~~~
It was a penalty. Someone else could take it if he wasn't on the pitch.

950~~~
You are talking nonsense!

If we are talking about a 28-year old who has taken care of himself healthwise then you may have a point. Rooney hasn't looked after himself like professionals should do.......in that wise, he could decline at the age of 22.

Fitness is very important to football players & Rooney has declined. Ronaldo is older than Rooney - who do you think would outpace the other in a 100m sprint today? Captainship has nothing to do with his performance. Rooney has been piss-poor now for 18 months.

951~~~
I hope LVG isn't afraid to drop him Captain or no Captain. Would do our team and probably him a world of good I think.

952~~~
There's plenty of examples out there on footballers who didn't look after themselves and declined dramatically because of it. Lee Sharpe could have been at United his entire career but was playing in Iceland by the time he was 30. Gazza is arguably the most talented midfielder the country has produced in 30+ years but was playing at Ranger's by his mid 20's. Rooney hasn't been abusive on the same level as these guys but he's still noticeably declined and his poor lifestyle will have contributed to it.

Others footballers like Torres/Fowler/Owen are similar to Rooney in that they all broke into the first team at incredibly young ages and fell off a cliff by their late 20s.

953~~~
We would've been in a lot worser position last year if it wasn't for Wayne, have some respect.. You don't score/assist the ammount he has by being shit.

217 goals & 113 assits in 445 games. Not bad for an overrated fat cnut at the age of 28, right?

954~~~
Never said he was shit. Rooney is or should I say was one of my favourite footballers. Difference is I like to call it as I see it on any footballer regardless if I have a soft spot. Like Anderson for example, long time I defended him etc.. but you have to call a spade a spade after a while.

Bring up all the statistics you like, I can see on the pitch why he is a hindrance especially for his country. The difference once Sterling went into the middle was remarkable. I predict LVG will come to the same conclusions after a while.

Ruud is the perfect example of how individually you might still be producing the goods in terms of end product, but your overall contribution as a team player is becoming more and more limited due to age and you need to move aside for the greater collective to move forward and progress. Rooney is at that stage... he needs to prove himself because at the moment, he is on course to be sold in my opinion.

He is still racking up decent goal/assists numbers, hell Ozil racked up insane level of assists at Madrid...

Both lack pace and dynamism though, hence why a Di Maria is just a better player. They're playing in key roles, they're meant to be the heartbeat of their respective sides.. I see more life in a feckin dodo. Slow, cumbersome, devoid of drive... compare Rooney's energy in a game to a Sterling or a Barkley.. world's apart. 

That is the type of energy you need from a top player in the number 10 role to win game after game for your side, he is not upto it I'm afraid. He's best as a 9... but even then.. likes of Aguero, Lewandowski, Sturridge, Benzema are more dynamic.. even though at his peak.. Rooney better than them all.

955~~~
I think he is only overrated until recently. You are only as goid as your last game. Lets look at things objectively and take all this nostalgic baloney out of it.

956~~~
Nah, I'm afraid it is you who is talking nonsense. A constant theme throughout your posting on here.

957~~~
I strongly disagree.....
We would have been in a stronger position. Kagawa would have had more appearances & Rooney's replacement or Welbeck/Hernandez would have done more as the centre forward. We coped well without Rooney towards the end of 12/13 season.

Considering it's taken him 36,000 minutes @ Man Utd to notch that, I couldn't be less impressed.

Messi has 356 goals & 154 assists in 33,469 mins for Barcelona.

958~~~
Yes, you know better than Scholes who already suggested Rooney is past his peak. Pogue, the world's most potent seer. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

959~~~
I wonder how different things would be if that free kick against Swansea at 1-1 which hit the post had gone in and we won the game.

People have short term/selective memory when they have agendas. Thank God we have LvG as manager and not you guys.

960~~~
I don't care about his stats, they are more about opportunity than anything else, I know my eyes are not deceiving me. Rooney's days are numbered at Utd. People can defend him all they want. His popularity is dwindling thus his money-making ability will decrease and there will be no need to keep such an over-rated player.

961~~~
So, Rooney is not as good as Messi...who would have thought that eh?

962~~~
It's not the stats though, the free kick could have gone in, doesn't change the fact that his overall game is in a very bad way just now. It's been shocking in his 4 games this season, during the world cup and inconsistent more than any other "top" player. Gives the ball away a lot more than he should with poor passing and bad touches. His slow decision making is also making us too predictable in an attacking sense.

963~~~
He's a striker. He's there to score goals when chances are created, which they have not been yet this season. Do you think Chelsea supporters expect Costa to create their chances and have brilliant "overall game". I can answer that question for you - NO.

964~~~
I think Rooney wouldn't have put a toe on the field if SAF had stayed another season.

965~~~
Strange comparison, Costa doesn't come deep and slow down play. He stays up top, where Wayne should stay but no, he always drops deep and tries that stupid crossfield ball that hardly ever comes off, or he takes far too long on the ball that by the time his minds made up every opposition player is back behind the ball. If he wants to play as a striker then he needs to act like one. Falcao is a striker who rarely drops deep, RVP hardly ever drops deep, because he's a striker. Rooney thinks he's a creative playmaker and a striker, and only one of those things are really true nowadays.

966~~~
I can name 10 forwards better than Rooney in Europe as we speak. Stop posting meaningless stats to explain Rooney's lack of basic skills on the ball.

His stats are padded up by his setplays. He had a shyte game yesterday but he scored. Stats will not remember his shit game but stats will remember he scored a goal any outfield player could have scored if Rooney wasn't on the pitch.

967~~~
Genuine question: When was Rooneys last top class game? Im not saying this as a bash, but when was it? What was the last game that stood out where he carried us (either with a performance or important goals).

The one thing Rooney can be accused of is his predictability as a number 10. Hes probably one of the worst (right now) that ive seen. A pass comes into him, he takes it away from goal and pings it out to the winger. This is like 4/5 times he does this. Unfortunately that winger is Valencia who then proceeds to smash it at a defenders ankles or over hits it for a throw / goal kick.

968~~~
Leverkusen away springs to my mind.

969~~~
Rooney is the modern jack of all trade, master of none. He's a street footballer, he doesn't understand positional discipline.

Falcao/RVP are better as a 9
Mata/Kagawa are better as a 10
Which leads to the $64,000 question, what position suits Rooney the most?

970~~~
I agree.

971~~~
fecking stats. Stats should be used to support an argument and not base the whole bloody dam thing on them.

972~~~
In the same game Valencia, Nani, Kagawa and Anderson also looked great. Shows a lot more about the opposition if anything.

973~~~
Erm, I think you'll find Rooney has always said his favoured position is up front but he's happy to play in different positions for the team. Needless to bring up his stats for the 09/10 season, the one season he was played in his preferred position the whole season.

Maybe if our midfield could do more of a job, he wouldn't feel the need to drop deep and make something happen. This crossfield ball obsession on here needs to stop as well. So he tries to switch up play a few times in a match, big deal.

974~~~
If he drops deep and wants to dictate play then he has to be more consistent with his control, passing and awareness but these are things Rooney's always been inconsistent with, and a lot more so recently. I don't see how people can't see this from watching him every week.

975~~~
One season then, when our wingers were actually good. Switching play to the right almost every time he picks up the ball is predictable. Watch the Swansea game again, and you'll see him try the same pass 5 times and Neil Taylor intercepted every one. It's predictable percentage football, there's no creative spark there. No, you see he drops deep and tries to be a playmaker but he just doesn't have the skill set anymore. Staying up top would give Mata more space to work in, and I agree the midfield do need to offer more but Rooney dropping deep is part of the problem when his play is hindering us even more.

976~~~
Acutally he tries to get the ball on the Left side of the 18 yard box then makes a couple dribbles to his right to try and get off a curling right foot shot. If that is not on, then he pings it out to Valencia and rushes into the box.
Rooney is as predictable as Valencia.

977~~~
I'd agree with this. I complain about Rooney a lot but I think if he was used as just a striker he would be fine. The number 10 role isn't working for him anymore and hasn't for a while, I don't really think he'd work as a left sided attacker either though.

978~~~
Uhm, Ando played just 10 minutes and made one through ball so he was hardly impressive. Yes, Kagawa and Nani looked good but it doesn't really make Leverkusen any worse. We didn't really win 5-0 against them at home either.

Not that I'm trying to defend Rooney anyway. I'd rather pick RVP over him any time of the day.

979~~~
Are you thick in the head? When and where did I post stats?

You are the one posting Messi stats to downplay Rooney's achievements at United, as if that told us anything we didn't already know.

And anyone who thinks Kagawa is better than Rooney in any position needs their heads checked. It's so blatantly untrue and yet has somehow become a fact. Ridiculous.

980~~~
But we have been told here that he's been better than RVP in the last 12 months.

981~~~
Not by me. Of course there are those camps, you know, RVP vs Rooney, previously it was Rooney vs Kagawa, Rooney vs Mata, Kagawa vs Mata, etc. It's how the shit rolls and I doubt we can change each other's minds here.

982~~~
All I'm hoping is that Falcao's arrival gives Rooney and RVP the kick up the arse they both need and that performances from the pair of them drastically improve and if not then both of them can sit on the bench for all I care.

983~~~
My point exactly. A penalty. Anyone critical of him will probably get "oh but he's scored X goals in the last X seasons so what are you talking about?" thrown at them, forgetting the amount of games he's had similar to last night where he scores but was a detrimental effect on the team otherwise.

984~~~
Kagawa is the better passer of the ball & he's way better than Rooney in close control.

Kagawa's vision, panache, calmness at the edge of the box is also better than Rooney. If Kagawa was the one tasked to be taking our set-plays, Rooney would be a nobody at United.

985~~~
Rooney is older now than Ricky Hatton was during his last great performance.

Sometimes being involved in many a war takes its toll on the body (particularly if you aren't a naturally fit person who has to work doubly hard to reach peak fitness).

986~~~
Yeah, you're wrong.

987~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

What a load of garbage.

ANd since you keep mentioning set plays, how many assist from set plays does Rooney have in the last 2 seasons?

988~~~
So Rooney has 3.1 assists/1000 minutes and Messi (arguably the greatest player in the history of football, playing most of his career for arguably the most dominant team in the history of football) has 4.5 assists/1000 minutes.

Aye, that has me convinced that Rooney's about as much use as a chocolate teapot.

You're not very good at this, are you?

989~~~
Giggs was also great in that match.

990~~~
Yep, a 40 year old stole the show.

991~~~
Not just wrong. He's a fecking idiot. Only a fecking idiot could post that drivel.

992~~~
don't worry, I'm on the case.

993~~~
I'm all for criticising players on here but that's completely made up.

994~~~
He also was impressive against Real fecking Madrid, what a shite club they are.

995~~~
You are clueless!
There are assists from open play and set play. Xavi takes the bulk of Barca's corner kicks & crossed freekicks. Rooney takes everything here at Man Utd. Surely, the assist stats would be skewed in Rooney's favour unless you are a dummy!

Why are you comparing assists? Why not compare the goals & chances created per game since Rooney likes to drop deep and play in the hole?

996~~~
No. He doesn't. In fact it was only relatively recently in his career he started taking free-kicks of any kind (Ronaldo and Giggs used to be first choice) and he still doesn't take a big proportion of corners or free-kicks from wide areas, seeing as he's needed in the box.  

This is frigging stupid. Like arguing with a potato. I'm out.

997~~~
Yeah, walk away before I break out my potatoes>Rooney stats...

998~~~
Nail on the head. Top level competition is great to have and I'm desperately hoping that at least one of the 2 rise to the challenge, if not both of them.

999~~~
Ronaldo left in 2009. That's 5 years ago. It's pretty stüpid you are mentioning Ronaldo after 5 years. Van Persie was injured for most parts of last season so Rooney was the chief set-piece taker. 

After getting destroyed, you have no choice but to run. Make sure i don't catch you again offering ridiculous excuses as to why Rooney is mediocre.

1000~~~
Fat chance.

1001~~~
Apart from the odd wink nothing really, although he did get a fairly weak side to the last when he tore Sweden a new one.  Still though, I wouldn't be Ronaldo's biggest fan anyway.  

When was the last time Rooney looked a class above the rest in an England jersey?

1002~~~
Rooney may not be playing great but, I think all forwards suffer from the support they get from the rest of the team. In the last year and a bit, none of our forwards have looked that great - this includes Chicha, RVP and Rooney. They've been shadows of themselves in so many games. Did they all suddenly become shit together or are there circumstances that have lead to this drop off?

Maybe a long time ago, Rooney could have taken over a game on his own and just played brilliantly without needing others but, even looking back to one of his best seasons (think 2010) - he was playing really well because we had an inform Valencia and even Nani supplying from the wings and behind him we had Scholes and even Giggs still around producing the goods. He is at his best when the team around him is playing well. When the team is mediocre, he isn't like Messi or Ronaldo, he also looks poor but, because he is a top player, still manages moments that win matches and have stats which belie the overall performance on the pitch.

The same applies to Rooney in the England team which as a whole plays such drab football and it's only individual players like Sterling that really standout. For United it's been Adnan because he is the one player we've had that can still do things on his own and now we have Di Maria. I think once the team starts playing with a little more tempo and a little more threat going forward, many will be talking about how good he is again. Someone mentioned the Leverkusen match, that's a great example of how good Rooney can be when the team plays well - something we've not really had happen in the last year too often.

1003~~~
Wish his tagline was 'Bannibal'.

1004~~~
While that's all well and good, bad service doesn't mean when you get the ball your touch turns rubbish and your passing goes bad. In tight situations he can hardly ever get away from a defender these days. Sturridge and Sterling looked head and shoulders over him unfortunately yesterday. 

No doubt Rooney can still finish when given the chance, but the rest of his game which used to be so strong is becoming quite poor now.

1005~~~
Rooney's touch to me hasn't always been all that - I still use that 09/2010 season as a good example - in the early part of the season he was scoring goals but, his touch was absolutely atrocious and it wasn't until January that somehow he finally found it and after his injury against Bayern he lost it - more like he went back to his old self, where it's really hit or miss with him on any given day. As for getting away from defenders, again I think it goes to the type of player he is - for him if the game is flowing and he is in a rhythm, then he can but, he is not the 18 year old Rooney or a player like Di Maria who you can expect to go past players at a whim.

His touch may not be the best but, because of who he is and what's expected of him that it's made out to be terrible. It's probably the weakest part of his game but, he has strengths such as his passing, goal scoring, set pieces, tireless running, mental toughness that make him integral to the team. That's why none of the managers drop him - because even when he his game is not that good - he offers a lot to the team.

1006~~~
Every time when he carried England through qualifying competition for the big tournaments. He is englands best player in the last 1 years simple as that. As with Ronaldo, you can argue that Portugal have better teams than England in the recent years.

But enough of that i just wanted to prove you wrong when you said that a player have to shine in the World Cup to be WC player.

1007~~~
Qualifying campaign?  Surely England have enough about them to get out of those kinda groups and into major tournaments... that's a given really and obviously Rooney will get a couple of goals here and there, but when tested against the bigger teams he's found wanting.  His general play just isn't good enough against better quality teams.... slow and deliberate.  Needs to be dropped in my opinion.

1008~~~
Ok agree do disagree.

1009~~~
I watch pretty much every England game and to suggest he's carried us is ridiculous. Most of the time, we've sailed through groups easily without needing any individual to carry us through. He's scored goals and has been one of our better players but England would have made it out of most groups without him.

1010~~~
Count out the points which brought Rooney tthrough his goals and you will see the result. He scored the most in the last 4 years for England and i am saying that by not watching any stats because every time you look who scored a goal for England it is almost always Rooney.

He is so underrated that it hurts. If England or United play bad it is always Rooney fault regardless that there is 10 other players on the pitch. When he does well it is his job or the other players made him look good

1011~~~
Others have mentioned it before but say he's having a shocker and it's 0-0. Say Sturridge wins a penalty and Rooney dispatches. The stats say that Rooney got us the 3 points which becomes misleading.

If Rooney doesn't play then someone will fill his place, they may be worse or they may be better but simply removing Rooney's goals or assists doesn't prove anything.

He's been good for both United and England, no one can deny that but I think cries for him to be dropped from either team are understandable.

1012~~~
Yeah, because his competition before Sturridge came into the team was Gerrard, Lampard and Defoe. It would be poor if he didn't have the most goals.

And people who bring up the fact that he will most likely become top scorer for United and England have to take into consideration that he has been starting up front for both teams for a decade now. Most good strikers would be close to the records if given the same time in the teams. And I do realise that he has obviously been doing something right to manage to keep a starting place for a decade, I just don't it's something peple should use when they are defending him.

1013~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/sep/04/wayne-rooney-england-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/sep/04/wayne-rooney-england-manchester-united</a>


Pretty much sums up what I feel about him...he's not the #10 to use if we want to play sharp passing football. He remains an efficient striker.

1014~~~
What's with this Rooney and #10? 

We always play with 2 strikers and Rooney is a Second Striker. The fact that he drop to create does not make him a AM. Be it Fergie's 4-4-2 (Scholes create from the midfield 4) or LvG's 3-4-1-2 (Mata creating from as the 1), he is part of the front 2 and that's where he excels in.

The problem is due to the weakness in the middle, Rooney spends more time creating rather than supporting the striker and this creates a perception that he is playing as #10 which is totally incorrect. This is probably the reason for this reduced effectiveness in goal scoring and not because he 'not a good AM'. Play him as SS with a good midfield and we'll reap benefits!

1015~~~
This!

1016~~~
He will score goals in the qualifiers for England and the media will announce his return to greatness and leadership. Then when the finals come around he will disappear as per usual. Its amazing how many goals he amasses in the qualifying arounds against lesser opponents but comes the WC and Euros he is crap.
In Brazil England looked pretty good against Italy and Rooney was a non-factor but instead of pushing on with the same formation they changed it up to favour Rooney. Sterling then looked less effective and Rooney scored a goal that was harder to miss than score and everyone said he redeemed himself at international finals.
Good thing LVG is not Hodgson. Captain or not if he keeps up his present form he will become intimately acquainted with our bench.

1017~~~

Very nicely written piece there.

1018~~~
Played well tonight.

1019~~~
what universe is this from? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1020~~~
Thought he was one of the better players tonight. I can think of 3 maybe 4 moments where he cocked it up a little but over all he looked one of the more inventive players and linked play nicely when required.

1021~~~
He was good today.

1022~~~
Apology not accepted.

1023~~~
Thought it was somone posting who'd only watched the first 5 minutes! Never ceases to amaze what a massively distorted opinion bias can cause. Really bizarre.

1024~~~
feck them. I just hope he continues to get back to his best. We need him, especially if RVP can't get going.

1025~~~
I don't think he's been bad at all this season so far.

1026~~~
Problem is that's his reputation outweighs his ability. You expect him to be the exciting star man for club and country and he just hasn't been that for many years. Not sure that's his fault really, media expectation.

1027~~~
Played okay, much better then so far this season.

His touch, however, is appalling.

1028~~~
No, he hasn't - he's been appalling! Hopefully he picks himself up and plays well though.

1029~~~
I'd say Welbeck and Saha are the only players he's ever partnered well with on a regular basis. Tonight you could see the difference without Sturridge.

1030~~~
Thought he had a good second half and his dribbling in attacking areas was actually quite sharp for a change.

1031~~~
hes been one of our worst players, tonight he has been good but its disappointing performance from him in the end because he wasted four chances and didn't score.  I think that's how we used to judge Welbeck didn't we?

1032~~~
Are you serious? He had a good game today but in his 4 games before that he has been abysmal. This has been the case with Rooney for years now. Too inconsistent to be regarded as world class, even though he is most certainly capable of world class moments.

1033~~~
my but the Rooney haters have some very twisted minds! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1034~~~
They say sthing positive but quickly find the negative thing.

1035~~~
Showed tonight that he's suffered from the lack of pace in your team more than anyone. Good performance.

1036~~~
Exactly. Welbeck generally always used to perform well but could never really take his chances. Double Standards.

1037~~~
What's wrong with his point? He put in a generally good performance whilst missing a couple of sitters. That's exactly what we used to complain about with Welbeck, no?

Except with Rooney it's usually the other way round. He generally puts in awful performances whilst taking his chances well.

If he can start doing both, <b>consistently</b> then I don't think anyone would be complaining

1038~~~
It is always good to know that there are players who suffers from lack of pace in the team and needs players around them(Rooney) and there are players actually with pace, generates spaces for their teammates and help them to look better (Welbeck) yeah and they actually score goals when playing as a striker..

1039~~~
What game were you watching? Sitters?!

1040~~~
Eh? He can't have been good <i>and </i>had a disappointing performance. Christ, only people with agendas can get tied up in such knots.

1041~~~
He was wrong in explaining it in such a contradictory way but I agree with his point. All  he really said was that the performance that Rooney put on today was typical of Welbeck a couple of years ago where his all round play was impressive but when it came to putting the ball in the net, he wasted his chances. That's what Rooney did today and what that poster meant by 'disappointing', just as most would have labelled it a disappointing performance were it Welbeck who had missed the same chances while playing decently the rest of the game.

Then I went on to explain that Rooney usually does the opposite in that his all round play is quite poor yet he manages to get a goal or two despite how bad he plays for the rest of the game. This is the reason most people, I included, are not fond of him. The real question is: Is his tendency to play bad for long periods in many games justified by his productivity? I believe not but I am not going to criticise another poster for having a different opinion by calling him a 'Fanboy'. Rather I will argue my reasons for believing this to be the case.

In what way do I have an agenda? I'm simply writing what I see. I dislike Rooney as a player in the same way I dislike Cleverley, Young and Valencia as players. Why does debating that point with certain people on a forum amount to me having an 'agenda'. I could just as easily call anyone defending him, such as yourself,  a 'Fanboy' , but you are not and I likewise, do not have an agenda. We just have a difference in opinion and neither one is correct nor incorrect.

You are the one getting tied up in a 'knot'. It's quite obvious what that poster meant to say yet you seem to be stuck on his poor choice of words rather than referring to the actual point he or I made.

1042~~~
Someone's trying to argue with me that Bony is better than Rooney because he scored 6 more goals last season, even though he plays as a striker and Rooney played off van Persie/Welbeck for most of the year. Added to that Rooney got 22 assists, picked up injuries and carried us through that run around Christmas virtually on his own.

1043~~~
His touch is atrocious, his decision making has deserted him also, he's supposed to be a top class performer but he looked like a player that  couldn't finish. 
Guess it's just the general lowering of standards, and you always get <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> hanging round a thread defending anyone who seems like an underdog, it was Moyes last season until the penny dropped and he's been back defending him since <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> even Cleverleys come in for a bit of fierce defense, you do love an underdog eh Pogue.

1044~~~
Good second half from Rooney tonight.

1045~~~
You seem the be only one who thinks Rooney was 'wank'. It rather seems more you're the one making contrarian statements, crying for attention, not Pogue.

1046~~~
He was a bit wank though, let's be fair.. No? 
Don't remember stating Pogue was "crying for attention" though, he just likes an underdog in my opinion, that's not a slant on his personality but it does create a bias at times, similar to my personal dislike of Rooney. 

All I can say is that I hope you're right and you most likely will be at some point during the season, sadly for United the most consistent fact is that so will you and so will I.

1047~~~
The fact that you have a "personal dislike of Rooney" pretty much makes your views on his performances worthless. I couldn't give a feck about his personality or his lifestyle or his wages as long as he does well for United. I'd say the same about any United player.

Bunch of fecking teenage girls on here who have their 'favourites' who are defended at all costs , and their hates who can do no right. We had one weirdo, alleged United fan, on here who wanted Rooney to get injured tonight FFS. Be better off finding a boyband to follow, not a football team.

1048~~~
Well like I said I do hope your right, and I have been proven wrong by Rooney before today, he just looks like a player past his best, I am not alone in this opinion, there's even a thread on it. 

Couldn't finish his dinner tonight.

1049~~~
Thought Rooney was good yesterday, especially 2nd half. Held it up well and played some nice intricate passes to his teammates which really opened up play.

1050~~~
Best performance in quite a while. Not great but contributed well.

1051~~~
Only thing he really did wrong was not hit that pass from Wilshere on the full volley in the first half. The amount of criticism he gets is astonishing. In the first half he was wide open, ready for a shot but Sterling bounced a bobbling pass at him instead of rolling, and despite controlling the terrible pass through the defenders legs, he was still lambasted for not doing better - when the pass was the problem. 

His first touch isn't great and he's not as fast as he used to be, but he was still a very effective attacking player tonight.

1052~~~
I'm a big critic of Rooney but he was okay tonight in the first half and good in the second. It was nice to see him running at the Swiss defence with purpose for the first goal and then produce a lovely weighted pass for Sterling. 

I think he's been pretty awful so far this season but hopefully tonight will act as a little boost of confidence for him, it was a good win for England.

1053~~~
England generally weren't great but he played the right pass to Sterling for the first goal and generally looked a bit better than his recent outings. 

Hopefully an improved performance to come against QPR.

1054~~~
He's on 300K a week ffs people, comparing him to Welbeck and Bony is ridiculous, I wouldn't be happy if Rooney added consistency to his game, he needs to offer alot more than that, that shouldnt even be in question, he gets paid in the same bracket as Messi and Ronaldo, I expect nothing less than 50+ goals/assists a season and to be at his best at all times, if he can't produce that we should get him off our books.

1055~~~
Jesus christ mate, he's not Messi and Ronaldo level for a start, and this is the premier league. No one scores 50 goals. He's a 25-30 goals player on top form.

1056~~~
Good game from Rooney tonight, I'm sure more will follow.

1057~~~
Really 50+ goals a season?? not even Ruud scored that many for us what is wrong with you.

1058~~~
He's on 200k a week but whatever helps you sleep at night I guess.

1059~~~
Isn't it 250 a week?

1060~~~
I'm sure it's 300

1061~~~
It was the same basic salary as he had before with united, around 200k, but we have an agreement where both United and Rooney benefit from sponsorships or something like that.

Edit:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/10756986/Manchester-United-made-a-smart-agreement-with-Wayne-Rooneys-new-deal.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...rt-agreement-with-Wayne-Rooneys-new-deal.html</a>

1062~~~
So if Rooney is expected to score 50+ goals for being on 250 a week how many should Falcao score 70? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1063~~~
I thought it was 250 k a week, but the rumor a couple of months back said they raised it to 300k a week. They later dispelled that rumor and said it was 250k a week but the new contract included Rooney benefiting from sponsorships.

He's on the same money as RVP and I think both have 250k a week.

1064~~~
Whatever the actual figure is, £200k/£250K/£300K, its well above his ability.

His agent is a genius.

1065~~~
He was ok tonight, had a decent snap shot near the end of the first half and looked more comfortable when Woy moved Sterling wider in the second half as in the first Rooney kept coming deep into the same space. His pass to Sterling in the lead up to the goal was nicely weighted, not always his strongest suit.

1066~~~
Good performance. Won't be his best but he grew into the game, he makes a good captain. Got in a huddle at the start and gave a team talk, and it's been the best England game I've seen in a while. I actually enjoyed it. We could have been a bit more clinical at times, Sterling should have scored in the second half, Rooney could have taken a volley on (would have in the second half I think).

1067~~~
He's one of the most marketable players in the world, and will soon be both Manchester United's and England's highest <b>ever </b>goalscorers. Saying he's shit or something like that just sounds dumb when all the facts point otherwise.

1068~~~
Salaries aren't based purely on footballing ability though. That may be wrong, but you can't say Rooney doesn't deserve it. He's marketable and all...

1069~~~
Yes he had a good game and considering the amount of weak countries in England's group one can expect him to score many goals but I hope persons don't start saying how great he is again. These matches should be taken in context, a better judge of his abilities will be against stronger opposition.

1070~~~
From what I saw last night, I think he was pretty good. I mean, by 'world class striker' standards it wasn't necessarily the best I've ever seen or anything - but it was a performance at a level where people do not have to defend/justify his status as a top player. It was the first performance in quite a while I think that I could probably watch with someone who has never watched him before, and not have to give them a long background explanation that he is actually one of the best players around. They could probably at least begin to conceive there may be something to such a statement based on last-night's performance.

He looked a bit quicker than he has done, and his link play was also quite impressive. I hope he continues to improve, as I'd imagine he'll be playing for us regardless.

1071~~~
Is my memory failing me or was it you that opened that "Wayne Rooney IS world class" thread?

1072~~~
World class agent?

1073~~~
Your memory is spot on <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1074~~~
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/wayne-rooney-2013-14-performances.185834/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/wayne-rooney-2013-14-performances.185834/</a>

1075~~~
He's been at the club 10 years, will soon be our highest goalscorer <b>ever</b> and he plays for Manchester United. Of course his latest (and final) salary negotiation was going to make him one of the highest paid players in the league. If the highest paid players in the league are on silly money, that's not down to Rooney's agent being a genius. It's down to all the money pumped into the PL over the last few years.

1076~~~
As I mentioned in the match thread last night, when Rooney plays well, England play well.  He is influence on games is massively under estimated by fans and the media alike.  If he's off form, then it affects the whole team, if he's on form, he makes everything tick.

Unfortunately, his season invariably pans out as follows, not exact obviously but I think you can get the gist, 1/3 injured, 1/3 coming back form injury/getting his form back, 1/3 the World class player everyone knows he can be.  He is coming in to form at just the right time for United, my guess is he will rip up the league for the next 2 months, get injured towards the end of November, be out until mid January, spend the rest of January & February and half of March trying to get back his form and rip it up again until the end of the season.

1077~~~
On his wage, 50+ goals/assists combined is whats expected, if Ronaldo and Messi can easily do that every season even with injuries why can't he, he is in the same wage bracket as them.

1078~~~
His opening line is telling:

This was in 2008, when we were the best club side in the world (we'd go on to win the CL and WCC only months later), and a 22 year old Rooney was one of our key players. But as the sentence makes clear, his 'talent and class' were <i>still</i> being questioned.

Such criticisms have dogged him for years.

Even in 2009/10, when he was a one-man goal machine, i'd go onto general/neutral football forums and you'd have people saying he'd simply become a tap-in merchant whose all around game had declined.

Or post-World Cup 2010, when the vitriol and 'Rooney is finished' type commentary was at a similar level to what it is now. It took months and months and months of him playing well - well enough to secure a 5th placed finish in the Ballon d'Or that season - before people finally dropped it.

Or in 2011/12, when he once again scored 27 league goals (he had a better goals per minute ration than RvP, the Golden Boot winner that season), and was once again dismissed as a tap-in merchant who didn't contribute enough to the build up play, and was the major reason we lost the league to City (people still argue that now).

Some people are just going to criticise him whatever he does, not least because he's been the most high profile player at the most hated club in the country for years.

Personally - and you can call me petty if you like - I can't wait to see him retire from England. Let Wilshere/Sterling/Sturridge have to put up with all the 'build them up to knock them down' shite that is flung at all of the better England players without fail.

1079~~~
Let me break down you in more simpler words, 50+ goals and assists combined, now is that too much to ask for a 300k a week player?
Would you expect that much from Messi or Rinaldo?

1080~~~
Basically agree with all of this. It's a shame he received England captaincy, as he will now play to an older age which will be detrimental to himself, Manchester United, and England, much like the over preservation of Gerrard and Lampard.

1081~~~
Ffs, it 50+ goals and assists combined I'm asking for, is that really to much?
Your right he ain't as good as them so why are we paying him that amount of money? I rather we get rid and get Messi or Ronaldo, I'd take Suarez over him too. At the end of this year if he's not up to scratch and Falcao does well, I'd be happy to replace him with Falcao for good.

1082~~~
How many players in the last 10 years or so have got 50 goals + assists aside from Messi or Ronaldo? Not many, that's for sure.

So, yes you're asking too much especially given the amount of chances we create nowadays.

1083~~~
Football - the fickle man's game.

WUM? If not, worst post ever?

1084~~~
Seems like he's deceived you all into believing that, 'you get what you pay for', in Rooneys case it the opposite, he used to be good but he's declining. Seriously standards have dropped here and it seems were clutching on anything we can but what I don't understand is that what people don't realise after the summer we've had we don't need to anymore

1085~~~
Best outfield player last season. Best player this pre season. But yeah, a couple of poor games when the whole team is shit and he is on the decline. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1086~~~
I'm not a WUM, I've watched Rooney ever since he's been here but now he's not as good as he used to be, how hard is that to accept, he does deserve what he gets, I can say a lot but can't be bothered.
Just because my opinion differs from yours doesn't make me a WUM, these forum are open to debate and feel free to do so

1087~~~
why are people ignoring teh fact that Sterling, Sturridge, Welbeck is a better front 3 than the one who played yesterday??

1088~~~
I really have no idea what the feck you are are talking about. You're expecting a Ronaldo/Messi level output which is beyond ridiculous.

1089~~~
The hypothesis behind that post I quoted is ludicrous beyond belief!

1090~~~
Yorke, Van Nistelrooy and Ronaldo did it only. And only once.

1091~~~
Best outfield player Hahaha, how many times have I heard that Lol, what position did we finish? Oh yeah 7th or something like that, if  that's what we can achieve with WC Rooney then God help us.

1092~~~
Thank you - it's not just me then!

1093~~~
The whole team being average is no excuse for Wayne Rooney to join them. This mentality is growing largely amongst United fans and its beyond a joke. Its not hard to shine in an average team is how you should judge one of the highest paid players in the league. Not come up with excuses. Heard enough of those for Kagawa, Nani, Mata and co.......

1094~~~
Your defending of Rooney is ludicrous beyond belief, come to terms with it, he peaked early and is on the decline

1095~~~
Rooney was decent yesterday but you can't help but feel England would be stronger with a diamond with Sterling at the tip and Sturridge/Welbz as the front two. He slows the game down, especially against better opponents.

1096~~~
Why because its Rooney, its okay not to.
This is exactly it when it concerns Rooney apologist, hes labeled as a WC player but when compared to some you all go 'you can't expect that from him' etc etc and say but his work ethic and he tracks back, 'do you see other WC player tracking back'. Excuses

1097~~~
The funny part is i think people felt relieved at that decent performance b/c they don't have discuss the fact that he isn't part of england's best front 3. And since ENgland won't face stiff competition from here on until the finals, they can hold it(discussion) off until then.

1098~~~
I demand from all our players Messi & Ronaldo level of production.

1099~~~
Seriously, what is your point? That Rooney isn't as good as Messi/Ronaldo? Well, that's me blown away

1100~~~
If their on the same wage, yes

1101~~~
If you go back to my first post I'm talking in regards to him being compared to Welbeck and Bony and say that he shouldnt be compared to the likes of them but other WC players like Messi and Ronaldo as he is in their wage bracket. He is amongst the best paid players in the world compare him to them and he falls short. Another point I argued was about some poster saying would we not just be happy if Rooney found consistency in his game to which I said I expect a hell of a lot more than just consistency.

1102~~~
What's Ronaldo's wage?

1103~~~
I genuinely think England's best hope at producing decent performances at Euro 2016 is an injury to Rooney before the tournament as harsh as it sounds. He is the last remaining member of that overrated technically deficient, spoilt golden generation. That said, yesterday was decent from Rooney.. had abit of bite to his game but by no means is that a 300k a week performance and can he produce performances of that level week in week out? 

I really hope I'm wrong about criticising him and he has his best season, he used to be one of my favourite players... but at the moment he is a shadow of what he once was, but when you see some of the goals he scored in pre-season, I don't think we can write him off entirely.. I'd give him this season to prove himself before I definitely think of him as over the hill.

1104~~~
Do you know how much Ronaldo and Messi are on?

Do you even know how much Rooney is on? 

And why do you even care? I couldn't give a flying feck how much he's on. Same with Young or Nani or RVP or now Falcao.

1105~~~
Lol is all I can do, Rooney apologists, no need to say more

1106~~~
True,  but there's still space for Rooney behind those three IMO. Seeing as the Englamd midfield is pretty poor, a front 3 of the players you mentioned with Rooney dropping to the tip of a midfield three could be an option.

1107~~~
So, you don't actually know anything about what you are taking about and yet persist with your bs.

lol indeed.

1108~~~
Easy to say it like that isn't to suit your defending of him, he's an average player whose getting paid well over the odds.

1109~~~
From Forbes' list of the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/christinasettimi/2014/05/07/the-worlds-highest-paid-soccer-players-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">best paid players in the world</a>, as of July 2014:

So if Forbes are to be believed, Rooney doesn't earn *anything like* what Messi and Ronaldo do in terms of basic salary or even endorsements, and is actually closer to the Toure/Aguero/Torres/Bale level.

1110~~~
Except I haven't defended him at all. Just pointing out that you are chatting shite despite having no clue what any of them earn

1111~~~
Yeah that is the thing. People are talking about how wonderful England would be once Rooney is dropped or retires from England. But, when that happens the knives will be directed at the likes of Sterling, Barkley, Sturridge,etc. It is like that Corn Harvest episode of South Park.

1112~~~
Thanks for that info!!

1113~~~
According to the article, that list is not as of July 2014, but for the year ending June 2013, which means it doesn't factor in Rooney's new contract. He will now be closer to the top bracket of highest paid salaries in world football of Messi, Ronaldo and Ibrahimovic.

1114~~~
He will not actually.

Earnings, perhaps, salary, nope.

1115~~~
Yep. 6 years ago.

1116~~~
Yeah, he's supposed to have actually <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/10756986/Manchester-United-made-a-smart-agreement-with-Wayne-Rooneys-new-deal.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">taken a cut to his basic salary</a> with the last deal, but will end up making it back and more via commercial deals. 

Either way, it still leaves him miles behind what Ronaldo, Messi and Ibrahimovic get per week.

1117~~~
Is Rooney going to take over Cleverleys job of being the whipping boy?

1118~~~
He looks well up to the task so far.

Sticking out like a sore thumb out there. Giving the ball away, slowing play down....

1119~~~
Hehehe.

1120~~~
Fecking Rooney is on fire today. That's more like it of a United captain.

1121~~~
Some little shit hacked my account and posted that drivel.

1122~~~
Assist and goal in 45 minutes you numbnuts

1123~~~
He's been very good today, what slowing the play down? Are you high?

1124~~~
it was a question to the haters, not a statement numbnuts

1125~~~
. . . scoring goals, assisting goals - like he always does.

1126~~~
Draws level with Thierry Henry for goals scored in EPL on 175.

1127~~~
Actually, 160 for Rooney.

EDIT: I'm an idiot. Forgot he played for that one other club.

1128~~~
A goal and assist and an overall decent 45 mins. Imagine if Rooney was actually a half decent player?

1129~~~
Was it..

1130~~~
I thought he was pretty poor. Gave the ball away a few times and touch goes everywhere at times. Great finish though, he will always score goals.

1131~~~
good grief….

1132~~~
Take away the goal and assist and I agree he has still played well today.

He is going to need a very special season to get the haters off his back

1133~~~
392 passes in the first half?
Not bad

1134~~~
Even Adm has given the ball sometimes. That's all right because he's still contributing to our attacking play and is getting the numbers as well.

1135~~~
Seriously, what game do some of you watch?

1136~~~
He's winning the battle to not be replaced by Falcao by a distance with RVP.

1137~~~
The I hate Rooney no matter what he does game. Glad he is proving them all wrong.

1138~~~
He plays in a position where players are more likely to give the ball away

1139~~~
Imagine if he at least showed up for first three games of the season.

1140~~~
You mean just like others players of ours who played in first 3 games? 


*waiting for the 300k/week wage argument* *yawning*

1141~~~
Rooney confuses me. At times he can look like a Sunday League player and do the simplest things wrong, then he goes ahead and delivers some moments of pure brilliance like this

1142~~~
That pass to Valencia was sumptuous.

1143~~~
It was and the most important thing was it was timed well, at a moment where it was need to switch flanks. I don't like it when he does it and there are better passing options next to him but that one was spot on.

1144~~~
A shame about who the recipient was.

1145~~~
Definitely his best game of the season so far. In fact I'd say our whole attack had their best games so far.

1146~~~
Can't believe just how fecking good that looked.

1147~~~
You'll not get the 300k/w argument, but you'll get an argument that he is apparently our best player, so he should be playing much better than the likes of Young, Fletcher and Valencia.

1148~~~
He only made that pass 3 times today. A good indicator that when we play with pace and create more space, there's no need to play that pass anymore.

1149~~~
Well, he does, doesn't he?

1150~~~
That pass is beautiful to watch for sure but it's even better when the play warrants it indeed. Rooney has often this tendency to look for Valencia when he could keep it simple.

1151~~~
Good performance from Rooney, keep him up top and he'll continue to score.

1152~~~
He's shit. And stuff.

1153~~~
Fair fecks to Wayne, he was very good today. Very good indeed.

1154~~~
Got the best set of players around him for any period since 2008/9. No surprise that he'll start to look better himself.

1155~~~
Well, obviously he has to improve on those early games performances but same can be said of most. Let's forget likes of Young and Valencia but Mata was no better. RvP can hide behind playing no games in pre-season but he hasn't been any good. In fact, has been worst. So, my point simply is, don't single out Rooney. He is among our best players, not the best. How well they all do and compliment each other and cover up for each other during an individual's bad day will determine where we finish.

1156~~~
I didn't single him out, it was just response to wr's "he is average player" or whatever, since people were right to call him average basing on those performances.

1157~~~
That pass to Valencia was almost as sweet as as Herrera's goal. It was the second sexiest thing we did on the pitch today, after Di Maria's pass to RvP and just ahead of the referee falling on his arse. 

Shame it was to Valencia and not Januzaj or Di Maria.

1158~~~
Very good game. I'm a frequent critic of his game, but his finishing is just incredible. He doesn't get enough credit for that.

1159~~~
Very good finish today. Rio probably he'd give his old buddy a chance to score by not closing him down.

1160~~~
Hopefully he can start to find his groove again and perhaps find some of his best form. Really positive signs today since I was concerned he really wasn't going to perform this season, but LVG's faith in him may reap some benefits.

1161~~~
Very good game, assist and a goal, what more could you wish for.

1162~~~
He can score, no one should question that, even when he's had to play deeper he scores.

But as many others have pointed out he doesn't have the best touch these days as well as other technical issues.

Anyone remember that goal he scored when we hosted Milan in 2007, I believe it was our third goal in a 3-2 win? 

Such pace and precision in that one, where is that Rooney?

1163~~~
Looked quick enough today, sprinting down the left wing with Di Maria, in the build up to the first goal.

1164~~~
Still don't think his overall game was top notch but one goal and one assist so what more can you ask for.

1165~~~
when hes got time he can play deeper thats certain. I liked his second half performance

1166~~~
He'll be our best striker this season and hopefully be within touching distance of the record.

1167~~~
A la Scholes

1168~~~
Didnt you see that today when he had a tidy finish to the bottom corner to beat the keeper at his near post?

1169~~~
Played very well today, I thought. Should be played as a striker as much as possible rather than as a #10.

1170~~~
Top notch performance. Touch was off at times but his clincal finishing is brilliant. That cross field pass to Valencia was absolutely crazy too.

1171~~~
Not at all the same sort of goal I'm talking about.

I'm off two minds about Rooney, but if you play him up front then I'm on board. Him dropping deeper should only be done when required because of many injuries, imho.

I'd rather see Herrera in the hole than Rooney, for example.

1172~~~
Dodgy first touch, rubbish in the middle, but was a good all round performance. Shows that him and RVP just cant play together very well.

1173~~~
That's the way we need him to play. Something like second striker, he should not get the ball to deep, as he lacks the ability to do the right thing (you could see what happened when Mata was taken out), his first touch is to problematic (we could see it in the early stages of the game), but he is excellent goal score (the goal was great) and so long he doesn't get to many balls to deep, he should do really good for us.

I don't rate him as number ten, also not as a lone striker (not at all), but as a SS it should be able to use the thing he is still WC in, and that is goalscoring, while not playing as a poacher as it would limit him to much and we actually don't play a system like that (as he is a good all round player, but the problem is that as number ten he needs to have a great first touch and short pass, which he doesn't, not even good one).

Anyway, a good game from him, hope he continues improving, as we do need it as he is a certain starter.

1174~~~
Wayne Rooney thread is nowadays among the worst on caf. Probably after the PS4 V XBox one. I have been a guilty party too on occasions to it. When he does well, those who like Rooney come here in numbers to praise him and when he does bad, those who don't like turn up in numbers <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>
In the end, he is crucial part of our team and we by now know that he goes through ebb and flow even during a game, so we should be used to that. For those who want him gone, it ain't gonna happen and he remains a crucial part of team.

1175~~~
There's always one..

1176~~~
Was i wrong ?

1177~~~
His touch was actually really good today.

1178~~~
He wasn't rubbish, so, probably yeah.

1179~~~
Well, yes.

1180~~~
Strange that you would bring up that goal against AC Milan because it was just a first time finish to beat Dida at his near post. 

Right now I'd have him over RVP. Both of them are too similar and their runs are clashing with each other. I doubt LVG will drop either one of them though. Seems like there's board pressure to play both of them every game.

1181~~~
When people stand off him he plays like this. But get tight to him and surround him and his control goes to utter shit. Still, good performance.

1182~~~
There were times where the ball would simply bounce off his foot rather than him have any control, his goal for instance the ball just bounced up. That could have been intentional but it didn't look like it to me. 

When he started playing in the middle, our game slowed down a bit, this could have been down to being ahead by quite a distance and us just lacking any more urgency, but i felt we were more fluid with Mata in the middle. 

Lastly i said he had an all round good performance except for the two above things i mentioned.

1183~~~
Decent performance, took his goal really well. He doesn't dominate games like he used to though, hopefully as the team improves he'll get back to his best.

1184~~~
Well i think the QPR answered the question that he should player as one of the strikers and not in midfield as the interplay that Mata had with ADM and AH was not the same when he went off and Rooney filled his position.

1185~~~
I was starting to get frustrated with him and his pub player antics and then he banged that goal in out of very little. After that he was fantastic, nearly everything coming off for him. Strange player is Rooney. Definitely showed he deserves his place in the lineup on merit though and not just de facto as captain.

1186~~~
Very good today, rvp needs to get his shit together or end up on the bench more often than not. More of the same please

1187~~~
I agree, I want to see Rooney and Falcao with Mata behind.

The difference between this goal and the Milan goal is that Rooney was running full pelt away from the goal and in full stride turned and pounded it into a corner.

I'm not criticising his play today, just noting he's been a bit more conservative perhaps in his play since he's gone back to playing up top.

As I said before if he's playing up top I'm happy, but I'm only so-so on him from deeper positions.

1188~~~
Rooney has a very good game = 3 pages of positive posts

Rooney has a very poor game = 30 pages of negative posts

Ah well, great game today from Rooney. Bagged a great goal and an assist. Hopefully he can continue this level of performance.

1189~~~
I'm generally in the 'Rooney Hater' camp but credit where credit is due. He had a very good game today. If he keeps this up and if RvP keeps performing how he is, then I'd say the latter is the one who should be dropped. That is a big if though in my opinion but it's great that we have such quality options up front. It should keep them all playing at their full capabilities as they will know not to take their position in the starting XI for granted

1190~~~
Its like that with pretty much every player, new signings aside.

1191~~~
Not his best performance in a United shirt but still better than most of the players another member recently posted 20 players who are better than Wazza in the premier league right now??  It was an 8 out of 10 performance and wasn't even at his best.  Some people have to wise up about him being shit..It's getting boring

1192~~~
Indeed it was. There was one occasion in which he controlled a long ball in sublime fashion. And I'm usually one of the people who lambast him for it.

1193~~~
Big Rooney critic here.. but he played well. Great finish as well.

1194~~~
Anyone fancy doing a GIF/Vine of his cross-field ball to Valencia?

1195~~~
I was amazed that they actually passed to each other today.

Granted it was only about twice but it actually happened. Unless I was still drunk...

1196~~~
People have opinions. Just because you don't agree with them doesn't make it 'boring'. If he can consistently perform as he did today then I for one would be more than happy for him to remain in the starting line up. And no I don't mean 'consistently' as in I expect him to score and assist every single game. Rather I'd like to see him just stay at a decent enough level without his horrendous dips in form. We all know how well Rooney <b>can</b> perform. There is just the problem of how incredibly inconsistent he is for a player of his class and age.

1197~~~
He was good today, but he needs to stay upfront and play as an out-and-out striker all the time, he is not needed in the midfield.

1198~~~
Beat me to it. What a ball that was!

1199~~~
Currently better than RVP who hasn't been great for a while now.

1200~~~
Not really. With two up top, I can imagine Van Gaal will always want one of his strikers dropping off and linking up with the midfielders, with the other one playing on the last man. It also means, players can make runs in behind. 

In the first half, Rooney did a lot of the dropping off, while Van Persie was playing on the last man. When Rooney went in behind the forwards, Van Persie did a lot of the dropping off, while Falcao played on the last man. 

I think variation in attack and unpredictability is a pain for the opposition, and it showed today.

1201~~~
I doubt the board really cares who plays as long as we win.

1202~~~

1203~~~
People are overly critical of him and if this is because of the so called transfer requests and/or his wages it is unwarranted.

1204~~~
<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

1205~~~
Yeah variation is good, but i personally think that they should alternatively provide width and shouldn't drop beside Herrera.

1206~~~
Has anyone catched him discussing something/yelling with/at Rafael(?) after the Herrera's goal? It only showed it on the side of the screen so I hardly catched it so I wonder what was it about.

1207~~~
Ye. I think it all depends on players movement around then. I mean, if you watch Mata's goal again, Rooney and Van Persie were almost playing as wingers.

1208~~~
I caught that as well and was hoping it was discussed, but I have seen not a word about it.

1209~~~
Yeah I noticed that too, haven't a clue what it was about though.

1210~~~
He played like shit until his goal (while QPR defended doggedly), then he upped his game a level.

Hell, even the assist for Herrera was a poor shot that rebounded back to him.

That said, a goal and an assist on an average day? I'll take that any day of the week. Would you mind get going Robin?

1211~~~
I wish he'd scored that move where he talk the ball down with the outside of his foot, that'd have been nice.

1212~~~

1213~~~
Him up front with Mata at number 10. I don't think having RVP, Falcao and Rooney on at once will work very well. They will make similar movements and just take space away from each other.

1214~~~
Thought he was good today. I've been critical of Rooney before but I genuinely hope these new signings can help him to perform better and more consistently. It's not exactly been easy for him to score and create when our midfield and wings have been so poor for such a long time. 

Regarding him, RVP and Falcao being on the pitch at the same time, I think it could potentially work. When Falcao came on today they were all taking up different positions, all moving around and all getting on the ball and into the box. We could have quite easily got another two goals out of these three players after Falcao came on

1215~~~
I missed his goal which was quite well-taken, but at times he stood out to me as not as gifted as the players around him.

1216~~~
He did good today mainly after his goal, before that he was frustrating, everytime he drops to middle to receive the ball instead of doing a forward pass, he would always turn and pass backwards

And then you got Di Maria, who gets ball and always goes forward with it, tbh thats what I expect from Rooney

Thats the thing about Rooney hes so polarising, there's some matches, he will play utter shite, and then other games every good thing will start or go through him

1217~~~
Did good today, good finish for the goal. Needs to stop passing the ball to Valencia every chance he gets...

1218~~~
He probably should have scored another, but overall he put in a decent shift which was overshadowed by Di Maria, Hererra and Blinds great performances.

1219~~~
That was my one and only issue with him today. He kept going backwards and playing safe passes a lot of the time. He missed so many progressive passes.

1220~~~
What i like about him is that he shoots from distance, not like some other players in our team. He sees a chance and tries to smash it in. That is not always positive, but sometimes it is needed. There was a time where he ddidnt shoot from distance and always passed the ball to the flanks, even though he was in a great position. Agree that he looks better than RvP at the moment, but that can change in the future.

1221~~~
A good game for Wayne and congratulations to him on becoming the joint 3rd top scorer in the Premier League! He's had an amazing career and plenty of time to go yet, he should end up breaking a number of records.

1222~~~
Thought he was very good without being fantastic, did his job well andpleased to see him score and as said, congrats on climbing the goal scoring ladder.

1223~~~
He pings them to diMaria/Januzaj/Rafael we ll see a different result.

It isnt the passer that is the problem here.

1224~~~
Rooney with a sly dig at Gerrard. Good to see.

1225~~~
Anyone else think the team spirit right now is better then its been for years? There was a proper togetherness I felt today, especially with the way they celebrated all the goals. They all looked genuinely happy to be playing for United.

1226~~~
it is sad that we lost so many leaders, but at the same time i like the fact that there will be new ones and a new hierarchy in the dressing room. Totally exciting. I think the team spirit is better than before, better team now and i think the players know that we can challenge for trophies in the near future.

1227~~~
Had a decent game and genuinely looked up for it, I think he needs to work on his short passing game though and not rake it out wide every chance he gets.

No Falcao love? <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/> I'm guessing Di Maria doesn't have a twitter?

1228~~~
There was a definite freshness, and good vibe to the team, thats been needed for a while. Too many players had become too comfortable at United, happy to put in as little effort as possible in order to get on by. Most of that has been cleared out, and the squad is now full of players that are desperate to succeed at United. Its unbelievably exciting.

1229~~~
no, but hsi wife has an instagram account. Just remembering the Di Maria photoshopped pictures that United fans send her <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1230~~~
Yep. It was best orchestrated through Herrera's gigantic grin at the fact Mata had scored from a di Maria fluffed shot. All of these players really look like they 'want to play for the shirt'. I know we were all poking fun at our Spanish-speaking contingent, but it sure seems like they've revitalised the dressing room, which is awesome.

1231~~~
Whenever players come in of this quality, it is going to give everyone a lift and players will look forward to coming into training the next day. A win on top of that, that brings happiness and confidence. Long may it continue but it was only QPR at home at the end of the day.

1232~~~
He completely was enjoying playing with Di Maria on that side. Almost like the old days with Ronnie.

1233~~~
Rooney had a good game; an assist for Herrera and a clinical finish from the edge of the box, along with decent link-up play with the other attackers. I don't think he'll ever be explosive as he was pre-2010/11, but I don't think we need him to be that player again. Rather than explosions of pace and power, I'd prefer he continued to develop his vision in between the lines and his first touch and passing in and around the box (his long shot is still good so no problems there). I predict a big season for Wayne.

1234~~~
Rooney was not as prominent as he's often been and I'm kind of happy about that because it means other players are excelling around him.  I really have no complaints about his performance today, just my usual wish that his first touch would improve.

1235~~~
I saw that as well, kept rewatching that to see what the issue was. They seemed fine afterwards so it had to be something minor.

1236~~~
Good enough finisher when he plays up front, capable of fantastic Scholes-esqe long passes from midfield, but utterly frustrating when he plays in that number 10 role. He's not clinical enough, and always seems to end up with a backward pass.

But all in all, a decent performance from him. Maybe a bit unlucky that on this day there were a few who played even better.

1237~~~
It's funny because, after Ronaldo, guess who Rooney provided most goals to? And that just in two seasons. Robin to Rooney, same thing.

1238~~~
Looks like he was consoling him about something, also hugged him. Trying to calm him down? 

Guess the players gotten used to him being a captain and now coming to him with problems.

1239~~~
Top game Rooney. 

The game shows that Rooney as a second striker can be very good. He probably has a poor first touch sometimes to be our first choice no.10 and drops in too deep too often to be a lone no.9. But to my eyes, this role suited him beautifully well- the second striker. Again, early days and he has had a couple of bad games too but this looks like a good position for him.

1240~~~

1241~~~
No Falcao? Someone's jealous. Two players on 400k per week, it happens.







<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

Here's that pass.

1242~~~
Thing is that pass just turns out to be pointless in the end, because of the recipient. I suppose it might stop when turn back Tony isn't playing at all.

1243~~~
Credit where due, was very good yesterday, and played one of the best passes I have seen in years to Valencia.

1244~~~
Calm down. Di Maria's pass to RVP was something out of the ordinary. Lots of players can spray crossfield balls to the wing.

1245~~~
I thought he was good yesterday - he seemed a lot more adept than RVP at covering wide without the ball, and then with the ball he's always a lot better the further up the pitch he is. It seems to me that, at the moment, Rooney is more likely to look backwards for the quick pass than forwards, which is fine when you're up front and that quick pass is into ADM and Mata... but drop him down the pitch a little further and that pass is going to Blind or our CB's, which doesn't bring us forward quick enough.

1246~~~
With so many new (very good) players and a new manager, Rooney and the other "old" players need to adapt as well. So let's give him time but I'm sure he's glad he's got other players on the pitch who can create something now

1247~~~
There are levels to cross-field passes. Rooney's was not your average switch.  Di Maria's pass was also exceptional, although not seen amongst good players. I've seen veron play that pass more than once, and Modric almost whenever he feels like it.

1248~~~
Interesting........

1249~~~
He's fat and slow, end of.

1250~~~
Reminds me of one he played to Giggs in the lead up to Scholes' goal in the League Cup semi-final Vs City in 2010:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zUO2GfEt8jY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1251~~~
Read the comments below the tweet. There are people who still refuse to believe it, because it doesn't fit in with their preconceived notions of him being old, slow and past it.

1252~~~
credit it to him, he played really well and scored a really good goal. Its clear that if RVP, Mata or Falcao want his place they'll have to work for it
i think all the attackers played well simply by virtue of being surrounded by better players (obv i know)
wayne wasn't given overly special attention because QPR had other things to worry about, giving him more space and time to express himself
shame he couldn't get a shot away when he was put through 2nd half, the initial take was perfect but his second touch was too heavy

1253~~~
The same on here.

1254~~~
Ah Instagram, the best transfer source of the summer! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1255~~~
Well, exactly. Hence there's only been 6 posts on here in the 6 hours since that stat was posted.

Had he been the slowest player on the pitch, you would have seen about 10 times that number saying he's over the hill and needs to be sold immediately,

1256~~~
It's funny how as soon as Valencia comes on he instantly reverts to "what to do, what to do, ooh I know, spray it out wide to Antonio repeatedly!". 

Other than that he played really well.

1257~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1258~~~
*sighs* Let's not pretend that the Matchday thread's Friends of Rooney don't have "Have that, you haters!1!" pre-typed in case he scores.

1259~~~
There is absolutly no way that Rooney is faster then Di Maria. No chance.

Those stats are bollocks.

1260~~~
Probably a burst of acceleration over a shorter distance or something

1261~~~
Well, the chips are probably back on the menu... <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Seriously though, this thread's a wreck due to each side accusing the other of being kneejerk twits.

1262~~~
Caftards do love their myths more than facts, that's for sure.

1263~~~
Rooney has always looked better when surrounded by other top players (surprise surprise). He was more consistent with his overall play back between 06-11 when we had an all around quality team, with a good system, rather then just relying on moments of quality and the rest of the team being disjointed. 

I love how so many people thought he'd be the fall guy but he's proven time and time again how good he is and how he fits into so many different systems and can always be effective. Very good game from him yesterday and I'm sure there's more to come.

1264~~~
Those stats are from that one game, Di Maria might not have needed to use full pace where as Rooney was at his peak speed.

1265~~~
Rooney played well yesterday, amazing how playing with actual quality can improve performance.

1266~~~
That's the spirit. When stats don't back up your opinion it's the stats that are wrong, clearly.

1267~~~
This thread is no more of a wreck than dozens of others on here. Although it's definitely got more than it's fair share of nonsensical posts.

1268~~~
You only need eyes to see that Rooney is not faster then Di Maria. These are the same 'stats' that showed Rooney is supposedly faster then Robben a few years ago. Again, clearly he's not.

1269~~~
Human eyes are really not the most precise measuring instrument.

And these stats only tell us that Rooney was the fastest yesterday, not that he's faster than di Maria when chasing cars, or whatever young ones do these days to test their speed.

1270~~~
You can tell feck all watching on telly, that's for sure.

If you're at the game, you can get a better idea on who might be the quickest but it's still not easy. Most of them are wearing GPS monitors these days so a stat like this will be much more likely to be accurate than an opinion from someone watching from the sidelines.

1271~~~
So you think Rooney is faster then Di Maria or Robben. I knew your Rooney bias was strong, but this is amazing.

1272~~~
It's a marginal difference anyway and might be because the one time they both really opened their legs (when they broke the length of the pitch before Herrera's goal) Di Maria was running with the ball and Rooney wasn't.

Whatever, it confirms that Rooney is bloody quick and all this crap about him being physically spent is more likely based on biased preconceptions than his actual performances on the pitch.

1273~~~
Eh?

I'm saying that Rooney hit a higher top speed than Di Maria in one game. Never mentioned Robben. Well, I'm not saying it. Just repeating somebody else's stats. Read the posts before responding ffs.

1274~~~
The stats are not wrong. Measuring speed is one of the easiest things to do - simple division of distance covered/time.

ADM is probably quicker than Rooney yes, but he obviously just didn't have a sprint as fast as Rooney yesterday. I reckon Rooney's top speed came from our 2nd goal when he was busting a gut on the overlap of ADM then came inside. I can't remember ADM sprinting at full pace at any time <b>without </b>the ball yesteday. I'd say that that is a more reasoned explanation, rather than the stats being wrong.

1275~~~
All you can really says is that Rooney was our fastest player yesterday. Doesn't necessarily mean he's our fastest player period, as has already been pointed out.

But even being fastest in any one game isn't bad going for someone who apparently - if his detractors are to believed - now can't run for toffee.

1276~~~
Rooney was very good yesterday. The new players lessen the onus on him and mata to run things and it a better that way. They're both got to focus on doing the business further forward yesterday.

1277~~~
To be quite honest, people on the extreme end of both sides of the argument routinely come across like childish dickwits. The whole "I hate him I hate him I hate him" thing is just as much of a fecking chore at this stage.

1278~~~
Jonny Evans was clocked at 20mph according to that article, so I dunno exactly how they calculate it.

Rooney was never a slow player, it's just that his style in the last few years makes him look that way.

1279~~~
They calculate it distance/time, I'd imagine.

1280~~~
Witchcraft!

1281~~~
Or maybe Opta contacted <a class="username" data-user="28415, @Sam" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28415/">@Sam</a> and asked him to measure with his eyes.

<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1282~~~
People might say i'm biased, and perhaps I am. I don't deny being a huge Rooney fanboy at all. He's my current favourite United player, and has been for a few years.

But I do like to think I retain a modicum of objectively regarding his performances. I've conceded that, over the last two seasons, you would be <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/wayne-rooney-2013-14-performances.185834/page-838#post-15904435">hard pushed</a> to say he's looked world class. I've conceded that people <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/wayne-rooney-2014-2015-performances.393849/page-16#post-16374390">were entitled to expect more</a> from him over the first few games of this season. That those who say he's no longer worth his wages are at least making <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/wayne-rooney-2014-2015-performances.393849/page-17#post-16375682">an arguable point</a>.

I do think, though, that the vast majority of dickishness and extremism comes from those who simply *do* seem to have an irrational dislike for Rooney the individual, and are basically just disguising that behind faux-concerns over his ability (or lack thereof).

This leads to them writing no end of utter nonsense about him - magnifying his flaws x 1000, playing down his attributes and consistent positive contributions, and ignoring context completely -  which I personally enjoy arguing against and trying to refute. As do others, I  presume. It's a fan forum after all, and partly what it's all about. Certainly beats sniping from the sidelines like you're above it all, anyway. Hence what look like endless tit-for-tat, back-and-forth debates.

On balance though, I reckon the fact  that Rooney continues to start for us, has been made our captain, and looks to be gaining form is a sign that those who believe he remains good enough to play for this club are generally in the right, and those who think he should be jibbed off wrong.

1283~~~
Can't deny his contribution, I'm just amazed at how bad his first touch has gotten.

1284~~~
I don't understand those who are bringing up the fact that Rooney can't be faster than Robben and ADM. Erm, he obviously isn't. All the stat is saying that yesterday, he hit a top sprint speed that was higher than even that clocked by ADM which goes on to sort of kill the myth that Rooney is "slow". He might not be the quickest but he's the fastest of our front 3.

1285~~~
But he's a pub player, how could he reach such speed? And he asked to leave twice, so obviously he can't be any good!

1286~~~
I'm just shocked he managed to reach 20.3mph with all those 300k worth of notes in his pockets.

1287~~~
Imagine our soon to be all time leading goalscorer being paid so handsomely? What a world we live in.

1288~~~
Sell him before he gets there and let's sign back the prolific Welbeck!

1289~~~
Calling that a 'spray pass' just shows how biased you are. It was a peach of a pass. Maybe AdM had one as good, but it does in no way reduce the quality of the pass.

Love him or hate him, seeing but not acknowledging it is just cheap.

1290~~~
It's always been inconsistent. Even amidst all the hype of his debut season I remember being surprised by how heavy his touch was at times. It's just one of those things. He'll always be capable of a poor touch under no real pressure. Also capable of a sublime first touch, mind you, but it can be frustrating to watch. I just find it weird the way so many people give the impression they can't see past a few heavy touches and appreciate the rest of his contribution in a particular game. It's like it winds them up so much they stop taking anything else in. 

Not aimed at you, specifically but definitely a recurring theme in Rooney threads. Especially since it became 'cool' to hate him.

1291~~~
I just find it surprising that everyone chooses to hate on him for his first touch now and not for the last decade that he's done it. But I guess the transfer requests and the 300k a week are adequate justification for the abuse.

1292~~~
I find it funny there'll be a generation of Manchester United supporters describing the clubs all time leading goalscorer to their children as a greedy waster with a shite touch.

1293~~~
I don't think that will ever happen. He is just 19 and 31 away from Law and Charlton's totals, hopefully this season, practically next. The big picture will overshadow minor drawbacks.

1294~~~
I think their opinions will change once he retires. I think people look back fondly once a player isn't playing anymore and while "fond" isn't a term the vast majority of the United fans will ever use for Rooney, I think they'll tell a different tale when they pass on stories of our leading goal scorer of all time to their children.

1295~~~
More likely to be describing him as a quality player that was a cnut too.

1296~~~
It's weird because whenever I go to games the crowd love what Rooney does. Also, a lot of United fans abroad love Rooney..hence why he sells the most shirts. 

It's on these forums where he is portrayed as a greedy waster with a shite touch.

1297~~~
It's not just these forums. You should take a look at Twitter. The nonsense they sprout there about Rooney is venomous.

1298~~~
He is cnut but he is OUR cnut. He'll go down as a greedy bastard , but someone who helped bring the club a lot of success.

1299~~~
Yep, there was a period I disliked Rooney but I still valued him as a player. I must admit he won be back over, I feel he's a club legend.

1300~~~
Twitter's Twitter though. I'm sure there's people slagging Di Maria off on there today. 

In fact, the worst are the people who phone up to Talksport etc. Someone rang up there the other week saying ''De Gea has never been good enough, ask any United fan..we all feel nervous every time somebody shoots at him'' when actually if you asked any United fan about De Gea, the opinion would be the complete opposite. 

A little off-topic but, there are many retards out there. On here, not so much, which is why I'm surprised Rooney get's bashed on here.

1301~~~
Indeed, though his touch was masked by his superb talent in other areas. He's lost the energy and aggression in his game which is what made him one of the best.

1302~~~
Surprised at those speed statistics. He definitely didn't look as fast as Di Maria but if they are accurate then fair enough. Shows how deceptive television can be I guess. Still find it a little strange though.

1303~~~
Wasn't he supposed to have fallen out with van Gaal by now?

1304~~~
Yea, and Welbeck was to be anointed as the new Muller.

1305~~~
It's always extremes with people when it comes to Rooney, but I guess he's also an extreme player. When he's hot he is really hot and when he is cold he's very cold. I can't think of anyone at his playing level  who's technique is so reliant on confidence, if he is having a bad patch even his 1st touch goes to shit.

1306~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Yes a lot (including myself) got those two very wrong.

1307~~~
Its incredible that its very likely that he'll more likely end his career as our, England and the EPL's top scorer and people will still say that he didn't fulfil his teenage potential. Perhaps people had unreasonable expectations of him.

1308~~~
I can see those scouse, esp RAWK, using this as another stick to beat us with. Another case of lost identity.

1309~~~
Is there any United legend that is liked by the Scousers? Anyway who bothers about those whingers? 

Just remind them of Rooney's titles as opposed to SlipperyG and they'll shut up!

1310~~~
Ooooh.. such wit. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1311~~~
Thought everyone knew that in a long sprint Rooney can reach unbelievable speeds? His problem has always been that his injuries seem to have taken away his acceleration which in football is much more important than the top speed a player can reach.

1312~~~
Judging by those stats Evans is 0.1 km/h slower than di Maria. You obviously can't get anything out of them.

1313~~~
Praised Sir Alex as best ever coach and expects to end career at United.

1314~~~
Good stuff. Best ever coach that he's been involved with? Or just the best coach ever in general? Anyone else notice the friendship he and Rojo seem to be developing? Have seen a few photos of them now and against QPR they had a bit of interaction as they came off the pitch. Good to see Wayne helping him settle in.

1315~~~
I think he took his role of a captain quite seriously. You could see some nice touches in QPR game -- fatherly hug of all the players that came to congratulate di Maria, then calming down Rafael about something...that what you mentioned. Obviously easier when we're winning of course.

1316~~~
The good thing about our new attacking wealth is that defenders have more to worry about now, it seemed to be in the last few years that Rooney was probably the opposition defenders biggest concern, and in a lot of games it looked as if he was crowded out by 2 players and not always finding the space he would of in his earlier years, I think this season the opposition has far more to worry about with Di Maria, Falcao, Herrera etc and that will benefit Rooney alot in my opinion as the oppositions attention wont be so much on him.

1317~~~
Not sure where these quotes are coming from but:
Edit - Ah, clicking the 'Rooney said' takes you to the Daily Mail article.

1318~~~
I have to say, I am not a fan of his these days, but after he was made captain he seems to have stepped up and matured a lot. I am impressed with how he is handling himself lately, long may this continue!

1319~~~
Here's something I found posted about Giggsy on the Caf when he was Rooney's age.


"I agree, in the beginning Giggsy play was unpredictable but nowadays he's a prone injury player and also every defenders have learnt his play style. According to me he should either change his style of play , i.e. do more passes than loosing the ball, or he should change his position in the team, maybe going upfront and this is what SAF is planning to do."


Not too dissimilar.

1320~~~
There was a period Giggs would be lambasted for poor performance.

1321~~~
He's actually looking seriously lean.

1322~~~
There is a pic of him holding a boot on the United facebook and he looks malnourished.

1323~~~
He has come back from pre season in good shape the last few seasons now.

1324~~~

1325~~~
Thing is, Rooney for me should have equalled the united record by now. If we kept Ronaldo for his peak years, he would have already gotten to it.

Yep, he was meant to be going Italy. Funny enough we go away to Juve and he puts in an amazing performance and that was that.

1326~~~
He should have equalled it if you had crazy expectations about him. Ronaldo is a scoring freak, not an example to measure other players with.

1327~~~
Ronaldo and Messi are freaks whose records won't be emulated by many. Unfair to compare Rooney with two amongst the History's top ten players.

1328~~~
This ain't no dregs you're smoking, it's some premium quality shit.

1329~~~
Hope he has a brilliant season, not only for our results but to shut up the 'haters'. I hate the way he's treated us during his contract renewals but that's in the past, move on and give the man a chance to lead our team.

1330~~~
So after all that fuss Rooney kicked up with Fergie about being a goalscorer, not wanting to play deep anymore and what not, he's now told Van Gaal that his best position is not as a striker but in behind and dropping into midfield.

1331~~~
Says he expects himself to get both Sir Bobby's all time goalscoring records.

1332~~~
Louis van Gaal - 'I was not satisfied with Rooney's performance as a striker and Mata as a midfielder.' (Hence trying something different and by not being 'satisfied' he mean't they played well but not spectacular).

He also said Rooney thinks his best position is in the CAM role, but I always thought he wanted to play as a striker and that's why he wanted to leave last season?

1333~~~
Coincidence now that we've signed Falcao? Maybe he feared for his position in the starting XI. Being captain and all, means he has a bit more leeway than the rest.

1334~~~
I'd definitely rather Rooney was played as a striker where he's less involved in the build-up. He's still a fine goal scorer, but our overall play suffers when he's at #10.

1335~~~
Low expectations from some of you guys.

1336~~~
Would rather much have Rooney in my team than not he's a great player and criminally under rated on the cafe.

1337~~~
with the comments made by vn gaal it seems he'll be on a tight rope if he doesn't perform today

1338~~~
So lvg not happy with his performance but rather than drop him drops our most productive player over the last ten games....

1339~~~
Enough of nepotism!

We demand changes! 

WE DEMAND TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY!

1340~~~
Played alright in the first half. Nice link up with Di Maria for the assist, played Van persie in with a lovely ball (who was marginally offside), and looked proper fast when he was sprinting through the middle to get on the end of an anticipated cross.

1341~~~
Playing well. Touch is good, and he;s not just hoofing it to the wing.

1342~~~
The pass to Di Maria was perfect. Still think he can do better though. Slows down play too much for my liking, and needs to stop looking to the right hand side as his main outlet. Better though.

1343~~~
he hasnt been in such good condition in a few years. He's back to his ball demanding best which can only be a positive for the football club.

1344~~~
I think he's had a decent half, mixing his passing up more.

1345~~~
Again touch is poor but his link up play is excellent today. Some bad decisions with his final ball too unfortunately.

1346~~~
looking good again

1347~~~
Rooney isn't captain material, after the pen he joined the panicking players, instead of calming everyone around him.

1348~~~
He was trying to get sent off in the last five minutes, wasn't he?

1349~~~
Did well when we were on top and dominating. When we needed to get control back though I don't think he did particularly well. But certainly not one of the poorer players today. I'm not a big fan of him dropping off, certainly not when Mata is available but I also think when up top in the diamond his willingess to track back, more so than say RVP would help us.

1350~~~
Worst captain ever

1351~~~
Its hard to watch him screaming at everyone around him, when he keeps giving the ball away on  the edge of his own box and in his own half and doesnt make a good pass all game

1352~~~
Officialy not world class anymore, its a pity that he's undroppable.

1353~~~
Makes you wonder about the rest when he was closest to 4th goal scorer at the moment of shot.

Good game until Clattenburg.

1354~~~
It's not about screaming, but just calming everyone, instead of panicking and giving a key pass to the opponent.

1355~~~
I actually wasn't impressed by him at all today, even in the first half. Thought he misplaced a lot of passes, and slowed down our play more often than not.

1356~~~
This!

1357~~~
Gave the ball away with a terrible clearance for the 3rd goal and then shouts at everyone else! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1358~~~
Wut? He was one of the best performers on the pitch today. 

People do expect superman goals all the time!

1359~~~
When he plays deeper that's what he does. He slows down our attack's. He doesn't have the vision or awareness of a proper playmaker so in turn just passes it back the way. He done well with Di Maria's goal, because he was looking into space, but most of the time he turns back and plays it wide after a few too many touches.

1360~~~
Where do i start with wayne? This is not knee jerk and have been feeling it for some time! Firstly he HAS been in decline for years now, there is no doubt in my mind! Been awful all season and is only getting in that team because of his reputation that he has created for himself a few years ago. Still has very good ability but his touch is dreadful. He is only starting because he is captain and he is only captain because there was nobody else which brings me on to my next point...

 Rooney lost his head after second after the appauling officiating! Which then resulted to a poor clearence just because he was still angry. He lost his head then had the cheek to single out the defence (which were bad in the 2nd) and was shouted and screaming at Blackett. He panicked the whole team! Blackett then got nervous as did the rest! As a senior memeber he should no when the time is to encourage and when to be a bit more brutal. That was not the time! To be honest i am sick of him and wouldnt mind to see him go!

1361~~~
That's a hard task right?

1362~~~
Pass for Di Maria's Goal, the one before Faulco hit the bar, the one where Van Persie was slightly offside are these not good balls? or have you just picked him out because you dislike him. He played key balls today for our chances and was involved in the goals. The attack was not the problem, the defence and ref cost us nothing else so stop your Rooney hate.

1363~~~
He looked fairly good today. Again, not at his very best, but was one of our better players.

1364~~~
So the pass behind Di Maria that he had to turn into a good one, the one where he took too long to pass to Van Persie... How about the 2 passes to Leicester players just outside his own box?

1365~~~
He is always one of the guys in our box when we get countered. Always!!

If 2/3 other guys did that we would concede less.

1366~~~
What I liked about his performance was that he was ahead of everyone. Literally. He was playing passes to players 10 minutes before they got into that position.

1367~~~
It was great seeing him so vocal but who will tell him when he's done bad, mainly the set pieces today. Di Maria's were a lot better today. He did okay in the role behind the front two today. Linked up nicely with Di Maria, Falcao and Herrera. Plus adds that physicality that Mata doesn't.

1368~~~
He should be playing in the front two. Despite the fact Rooney runs around a lot there isn't much discipline to his positioning. Yes, he gets back but he doesn't occupy the right spaces. The edge of our box was a Leicester shooting gallery. Rooney is not the right player to be heading up the diamond. It exposes his flaws as a player and does not bring out his greatest strengths.

1369~~~
His little meltdown after the third goal was pathetic. Taking no responsibility for his role in the goal at all. It was his wayward pass which set them up for the chance in the first place. Constantly slowed us down and offered nothing as an outlet. LVG will surely see it and act, just depends on if he sees it soon enough...

1370~~~
You're an idiot if you can't accept these were perfectly good passes and you clearly have an issue with one of our player which is quite frankly embarrassing. Player mis-place passes they all do and you single out Rooney.

1371~~~
No, they weren't good balls, they just had a quality player on the end of them. He underhit the pass for Di Maria, which arrived behind hence the lob. The pass to Falcao was equally poor, in that he lofts it into him at chest height when the ball along the ground was on. In both cases, the receiving player had to do more work with the pass.

He actually over-hit or under-hit every important pass he played today.

1372~~~
Thought he was decent.

1373~~~
Our best player today for me. Very creative, always involved and was the only c unt chasing back for their fourth goal

1374~~~
I actually enjoyed him bollocking everyone from the defenders to the referee. Passion that has been missing in his hand for a long while. He was decent as well.

1375~~~
Kinda pointless when he's also playing like an erratic lunatic though.

He was alright up until that penalty, but was complete garbage afterwards.

1376~~~
Exactly. Shouting at folk means bugger all when you can't clear a ball properly.

1377~~~
Did okay today, he put more effort in then a few other passengers today. I've managed to lower my expectations of Rooney to avoid unfairly criticising him and this seems to be working.

1378~~~
Was good when facing goal, dreadful when his back was towards goal(Which is what a number 10 will do a lot).

1379~~~
Decent/good until their penalty. Then his head went. Him shouting at our players when we conceded the third was hilarious, mostly cos he conceded the possession with his terrible clearance.

1380~~~
We dropped one of the few world class number 10s to shoehorn this shit footballer in. Then we bring said number 10 on as a left winger.

1381~~~
Played well, up until the penalty, when he like everyone else, he completely lost his head.

1382~~~
And you have extremely low standards if you think a pass behind a player that they do well to improvise with is a good pass.

1383~~~
Had a decent enough individual game but as a captain didn't carry out his duty.

1384~~~
Rooney did pretty well today in the 10 role.

1385~~~
If only we were half as creative in that second half as some of the spazzers in here trying to blame this on Rooney, we'd be golden.

1386~~~
Surprised so many people say he was good, thought he was shit. The ones who said he was "creative and linking up well" are surely having a laugh. Gotta wonder what game were some watching....

What was good about his performance was that he was tracking back a lot and gave a bollocking to the other players when it was required.

1387~~~
What are you smoking? Shit footballer? Go join RAWK ffs.

1388~~~
What a load of shite.

1389~~~
Did quite well up until the penalty. I don't see a leader there, though.

1390~~~
I didn't think he was bad today at all. If you're being picky a great leader would have kept their head together better and channelled their anger at the injustice towards putting an even better effort in on the pitch and galvanising their team mates. But that kind of leader is extremely rare and we already knew that Rooney wasn't one. It's hard to blame him for going ballistic when I was absolutely fuming myself.

1391~~~
He isn't a great number 10 by any means but he wasn't the problem today. He looks quite sharp physically wise. Playing with two centre forwards in front of him was a problem though.

1392~~~
Rooney just can't win, can he? <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1393~~~
Yeah, if we're going to play him in the number 10 role, then he's generally best when he's got one striker in front of him to link up with. Otherwise, there's a danger he just becomes a midfielder who's been pushed up a little bit.

1394~~~
Played a poor-ish game today, but I'm most concerned with his behavior after the pen. It's like he completely forgot we're still leading and there's a game left to play. Get him anger management or something. Every ball he touched since after the penalty was hoofed to no one in a fit of rage. You cannot, cannot do that, regardless of how badly the ref did you over. Especially if you're the bloody captain.

1395~~~
He was very good until our meltdown. Misplaced criticism, as usual with Rooney.

1396~~~
Rooney has to score a hattrick before he can be credited on here whereas RvP can do next to nothing and still be classed as one of our better performers.

1397~~~
When you talk about leaders on the pitch Rooney is not 1, shouting at players does feck all, inspiring players on the pitch is what a leader does. For example as a senior player in the team Rooney is a poor leader and example on the pitch. There was only 1 leader on the pitch today and it was Esteban Cambiasso, that is what a leader does. I hope that we get Strootman in January and give him the captains armband straight away - he has the leadership qualites we need.

1398~~~
I wouldn't say 'very good'. Had some good moments, but bad ones too. But he certainly wasn't "awful", as alleged above.

1399~~~
He played well in a fcuking weird game.

1400~~~
I agree, there were a lot of positives in a somewhat mixed performance.

Are you curious at all to see how we would set up and function without him? I would love to see how that would work.

1401~~~
Looked really good in the #10 role for the first 30 minutes or so. Went off the boil after that with the rest of the team.

1402~~~
Wonder what Rooney's touch would be like on a sunday league pitch? It is consistantly poor on World class pitches!

1403~~~
Had a mixed performance. Doesn't look as good at #10 as he does as a striker. So, no surprises basically.

1404~~~
Well, save for trophies and shit.

But, our approval is far away from him.

1405~~~
Does it matter? So you are blaming him for being one of the best performers?

1406~~~
Having Di Maria next to him has helped him hell of alot and expect to see many more combinations between the two over the course of the season. I wont lie, I have been highly critical of Wayne in the past for his lack of pace and for his inability to create space but if he has runners like Angel who can get behind the defence, then it makes it easier and clearer for him to know who he has to pass to.

1407~~~
Thought he was good on occasions but when we lost it he too got lost when he should have kept his head. No complaints with him so far.

1408~~~
Lost the plot after the pen, and the team followed suit. Almost similar to the Madrid game a couple of years ago, bad decision, Fergie lost it and so did the team. Rooney looked more arsed about complaining rather than pulling things together to battle back. 

At 3-3 there was no one on the pitch to to try and calm things down. I have no complaints about his performance but as a captain he needed to pull it together. There is no way we should have lost that game, you can buy class but you can't buy fight and today we showed that.

1409~~~
Have to agree with that. It was too early to lose the plot, at 3-2 we needed someone to step up and calm everything down. Even at 3-3, calm down, get it together, and go again. 4-3 down, fine, lose the plot, but he/we lost it way too early.

1410~~~
Rooney's passing and first touch is shocking for someone who's considered a "superstar" footballer.

He can't do perfect weighted passes or well timed ones. Even simple 4,5 yards passes he under hit it so the receiving guy had to lunge in to receive it.

Or when someone is making a run he mishit the angle slightly off so the ball either go behind the receiving guy or he had to full stretch to try get to the ball.

1411~~~
His short passing game and first touch are very, very unconvincing and inconsistent, yes. It's one of the reasons I don't like him as a 10.

Today I doubt Mata would've been much better as he struggles when put under physical pressure.

1412~~~
I am not his biggest fan but he was really good today, far better than Falcao or Rvp. No complains from him today, maybe he could have supported the defence a bit better being in the hole along with Herrera, but attacking wise a great assist for Di Maria goal, and couple of great passes for Falcao cross bar chance etc.

1413~~~
No I blame him for not playing like a top class player once again, but I didnt even think he played that well. Liked Rafa (apart from the stupid penal), Herrera, Falcao, di Maria more.

1414~~~
The usual suspects in here giving it the big one. That assist for Di Maria was absolutely incredible

1415~~~
Another good performance. Really liked the bollocking he gave everyone after that Cambiasso goal. We've been lacking that since Keano left. Shame it fell on deaf ears.

1416~~~
Ummm... You should try to watch Di Maria's goal if you missed it. Was rather good.

1417~~~
It was pretty funny when he lost his head. Very Arsenal's Gallas. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's taking this captaincy thing seriously, isn't he?

1418~~~
It was a decent weighted pass, but it's certainly not incredible. The finish tells the story, it was out of his stride and he managed to get it floating perfectly which is what I'd call incredible.

I'd have to watch the game again, but on the 3rd goal before he gave the heroic bollocking, I'm pretty certain he had an opportunity to clear the danger but didn't. Again I could be wrong but I do remember him being back there having a swing.

1419~~~
I have no problem with the captain losing his shit with the players, infact I positively encourage it at times, however, to do it after your own cockup has just cost the team a goal probably isn't the best moment.

1420~~~
He made too many mistakes in the 2nd half, had several passes intercepted and nearly hit the corner flag with a long pass when we really needed him to step up and get control of the game, must do better.

1421~~~
How exactly did Falcao had a better game than Rooney? Apart from the crossbar attempt, Falcao was not that involved either in the box. I want falcao to suceed too...but this game is not him at this best and it is obvious!

1422~~~
Steady on. Was a good ball but passes like the one Cesc made for Schurlle vs Burnley is an incredible assist.

1423~~~
I really liked him in the linkup, beat his defender a couple of times (havent seen Rooney do that in years), dropped back at the right times, he plays one touch football, and not that slow, keep the ball football. Was actually impressed with him, always thought it was just the goals for him.

1424~~~
In the end Rooney was the only one giving effort to run back, so for that I am refrain from bashing the guy. He was still giving it his all, while everyone else laid down.

1425~~~
Good start but like the rest of the team after penalty he disappeared. 

I like the fact he yelled at other players. If nothing it showed he cares... 

Didnt help but.

1426~~~
LVG should just drop one of Falcao or RVP and just play him as part of a front duo. Mata would be a better option behind the strikers IMO. Just think Mata is better in tight spaces and on the turn than Rooney. Rooney is faster than Mata but Mata is more agile and nimble which are rather important when you play in the No 10 role. 

Rooney's goalscoring ability, power and link-up play would be better utilized up front and I doubt whether RVP and Falcao would make much of a pair. They aren't involved in the game enough like Rooney and don't really enjoy dropping back. Also can't see one of them being dropped anytime soon though.

1427~~~
He was very good again today, if you think about it we've scored 7 goals in two games since our new signings started playing, and we are playing exciting football to which Rooney is playing a major part, we just need to sort out our defence. He is our best player after Di Maria right now.

1428~~~
I am sure it was, I haven't seen it however, what I have seen was Rooney's though  and it was absolutely exquisite. Sumptuous, magical, near on orgasmic. Absolutely top notch quality.

edit: Also on Van Gaal saying he thinks he's a 10 that came as a complete validation of what I was thinking. He just isn't a good enough 9 with a 10 in the side. He drops in and gets in their way. In terms of tactical utilization he's a much better out and out 10 than a 9 that is part of a unit with a dedicated 10 behind them.

Thank the lord I am not the only one who thought it over the last year and a bit. I just see it as completely pointless having him up front and having a 10 deployed behind him and another forward.

1429~~~
You mean the goal when Di Maria picked the ball up, ran past two players, gave it to Rooney, kept running at pace and forcing the defence back, Rooney made a basic pass under no pressure since Di Maria had already ran past the midfield and then lobbed the keeper from inside the box? That assist? Remind me again which player features for us in midfield and which one get's to pick his position? Di Maria is doing half of Rooney's job.

1430~~~
If anything, the pass was underhit and behind ADM. The beauty was most definitely in the finish, not the pass.

1431~~~
This.

1432~~~
That was incredible to you?

If that was incredible then how do you describe di Maria's finish?

1433~~~
Not just to me, Di Maria's finish was the vinegar stroke. While I am waxing symbolically,  the 5-3 finish was like waking up the next morning next to a fully matured wildebeest.

1434~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1435~~~
Rooneys pass is cause for polarising the caf. What a suprise. Lets just say it how it is. He made a pass that any number ten should make. He did however play a better pass in the game to RVP.

1436~~~
It was all about the movement from Di Maria to be honest, he made it easy for Wayne.

1437~~~
I miss the days when angry Rooney spelled trouble for the opposition. Nowadays it just makes him worse.

1438~~~
Absolutely. It's good to know that someone on the field shares van Gaal's passion for high standards.

1439~~~
Thought he actually played pretty well for the most part and did show a lot of effort (the only one taking back on their fourth goal etc..) but the yelling he did after the third goal was ridiculous. He just turned around and screamed at everyone despite him not being able to clear the ball properly which helped lead to their goal.

1440~~~
He was pissed off at Blind and Smalling getting in each other's way to cock up a routine defensive header. That incident aside, they were long overdue a bollocking for the 5-10 minutes leading up to it. Playing like strangers. No communication at all. Pub football.

1441~~~
Put Rooney and Falcao up front. Let Mata play his #10 position and see how that goes...

1442~~~
That's fair enough but it was still an odd time for him to react like that, preferably he'd give the bollocking before a goal happened and especially one that he played a big part in it happening.

1443~~~
Totally agree with you on this incident. Long overdue.

1444~~~
One interesting thing I picked up was in the LVG interview, LVG said Rooney told him that his best position is the #10. Make what you want of that but what I make from it is Rooney is being clever, by saying that it's either him or Mata and he knew Mata won't track back like he does, if he said striker is his best position which it is then he would be fighting for his place with RVP and Falcao who are miles better then him as a striker.

I'd like to see Rooney dropped just to see how it goes but his defensive duties are keeping him in the team more then anything else (apart from the 2nd goal today which he was part at fault)

1445~~~
But It's not like LVG cannot assess things himself.

1446~~~
Exactly. I'd be surprised if LVG pursues Rooney playing behind the strikers for too long.

1447~~~
This needs to be done.

1448~~~
Was a poorly weighted pass ADM had to improvise on greatly to score. Also directly at fault for their equaliser with a blind Clearance. Otherwise decent but not close to our best player today.

As a captain - very poor.Should have rallied the troops at 3-1 but instead lost the plot and caused 3-3.

1449~~~
I'll never understand how Rooney can make the long passes with such precision but fail miserably at the short to intermediate ones.

1450~~~
U actually thought this was one of rooney's best no. 10 performances in a while! We looked dangerous with him dropping unto space. 

As for the clearance I don't think he could have done much better but I should look again. Seemed like the ball came at him quick on a weird angle.

As for the screaming- if he did nothing people would have complained too. I saw nothing g wrong with it. A kick up the ads was needed. 

Another assist. Ridiculously productive player. Will start next week up top with Falcao.  RVP  to be a sub and deservedly so.

1451~~~
Rooney looks incredibly cumbersome and slow mentally and physically in the #10 role when compared to Mata.  I just hope that van Gaal drops one of Rooney/RVP/Falcao for Mata before we drop too many points.

1452~~~
That's how I felt after the goal so was happy to see it. 

Rooney had a good game so really don't buy into the "he was average today". He's not really a favorite on the caf. If someone like Kagawa or Rafeal had a similar game we'd be happy. 

I just always feel like you guys use a different scale for Rooney's performances based on his salary.

1453~~~
This is just sad and completely desperate.

1454~~~
He was good in the first half but his 2nd half was shocking. There was a time he just passed to the corner flag, it was such an bizarrely awful pass. He's miss hit clearance led to the 3rd goal, you'd expect some composure and leadership from him but he was just constantly giving the ball away.

1455~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Oh dear.

1456~~~
Not really that uncommon in English football. Michael Dawson, Gerrard, Huddlestone, Matt Taylor... lots of players who are excellent long passers but lack the consistency/focus/skill to hit short passes like Scholes, David Silva or even someone who never really tried much but always completed his short passes (Makelele) come to mind.

1457~~~
He was average in the second half... maybe less than average but not "shocking".

1458~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I was laughing at that. Not that they didn't deserve it, defending the way they did, but his team mates could have just piped up and muttered "you could have cleared the ball better, Wayne."

1459~~~
The thread comparing today's Rooney to a 17-year old Rooney had CAF members gushing about the young Rooney who had that temper in him. Well, now, as you've pointed out it just makes him look worse. Especially when you are the captain.

What's admirable about Rooney is that he kept tracking back, getting into Rojo and Blind's positions when they ventured forward. However, the 3rd goal showed us the ridiculous side of his game and he went bonkers after that. Bit of a hit and miss in the game.

I hope he gets it from LVG for his captaincy and the way he lost it.

1460~~~
People have pre-conceived notions that they just don't want to change. Until the 3rd goal he was our best player and played very well as a number 10. He was playing the kind of passes Mata is supposed to be able to play but has never done for us.

1461~~~
Jeez, it was a poor clearance, that could happen to anyone at any time. Not something that's part of his game, which tracking back is.

1462~~~
His poor side = that clearance + importantly, his reaction after that. Not sure he should have done that, especially when he was responsible for the goal too.

1463~~~
Him still being at the club shows how soft Fergie had become. Should have been sold a couple of seasons ago. Instead we gave him a contract so good we basically can't sell and have to play, and currently there are players better than him in both of his positions.

But since we can't get rid he should be used as an attacker solely. He can still knock em in with confidence and efficiency, I'll give him that. Let's put that to good use while we can. Someone like Mata should not be benched just so Rooney can show it's possible to earn a Lamborghini every week by being outpaced like a truck driver.

1464~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> ffs

1465~~~
They are strangers. They've never played together. They've scarcely even trained together. That long overdue bollocking might have made Rooney and some of the fans feel better, I doubt it did anything useful for our defenders. What followed suggested it didn't help. As for Rooney himself, after the penalty he went to pieces like the rest of the team.

1466~~~
Wasn't that the upside of this season out of Europe? All day, every day drilling together in specific combinations for the game at the weekend? That's a very weak excuse for their chaotic and ill-disciplined performance. Not to mention the number of physical battles they were losing. The sort of thing that would have had Schmeicel or Keane bursting a blood vessel if it happened when they were on the pitch. They richly deserved that bollocking, whether it made much of a difference or not. If nothing else, it might make them pay a bit more attention in training this week.

1467~~~
To play in midfield permanently now?

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/22/wayne-rooney-manchester-united-midfield-louis-van-gaal?CMP=twt_gu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...ter-united-midfield-louis-van-gaal?CMP=twt_gu</a>

Note: It's from Jamie Jackson so the text around the quotes could be as factual as a flying pig but interesting references from Louis all the same.

1468~~~
Smalling's only just back in training. I've no idea how much time he and Blind have spent working together. I'd have thought the priority was for Evans/Blackett/Blind work, but obviously I don't know.

If Schmeichel or Keane had been on the pitch Rooney would have been getting the bollocking along with them.

1469~~~
His club captain and his one of the highest earners worldwide so why shouldn't he be judged on the same level as Messi and Ronnie when his getting paid around there level?

1470~~~
FFS Pogue, the issue isn't giving out bollockings - it's the fact that he was one of the key components that completely fell apart and lost his shit as soon as 2-3 went in.

If he had taken responsibility as a captain we might have prevented the meltdown. Instead he lost his shit, fluffed a clearance that lead to 3-3, yelled at everyone like an angry kid and spent the rest of the game trying to get sent off instead of reestablishing control, retain possession and try to win us the game.

1471~~~
Key components? Responsibility as a captain?

Sorry but what should Rooney have been doing differently to stop us conceding stupid goals? His role on the pitch had zero defensive responsibilities (even though he was the only United player to get anywhere near Varney's run for their fourth)

That fluffed clearance is being massively exagerrated too. He was facing goal, 5 yards away from Smalling when the centre half went up to head a dropping ball, with no Leicester player anywhere near him. He'll have been expecting to watch the ball sail over his head, far away from the box. You can bet Rooney was as surprised as the rest of us when Blind challenged his own fecking man for the ball and Smalling could only manage a downwards header which reached Rooney about waist high. That's why he scuffed the clearance and that's why he was so annoyed. Justifiably so. It was one little incident which typified the complete lack of communication and concentration at the back.

1472~~~
Zero defensive responsibilities? That's not true. As LVG said he played him as a midfielder, not an attacker. Midfielders are supposed to defend. What made our game vs QPR impressive was the way our diamond worked together both attacking and defending (high up the pitch).

But okay, fair enough, what about retaining possession, calming the tempo of the game down instead of melting down like a spoilt child and starting to kick everyone around him for the last 10 minutes?

The reason we conceeded stupid goals is we lacked any semblance of control in the midfield areas, since all our players were concerned with running forward and none bothered to hold and control at all. Shouldn't our captain, playing in midfield, at some point, I don't know, do anything about that? 

And he panicked as much as everyone as soon as 2-3 went in. At a time when we needed a calm head, a leader, he once again exposed himself as somewhat immature. It's not that anyone else did anything to prevent it, it's that Rooney's expected to. He's the captain. It's not really difficult to comprehend is it?

For what it's worth: Yes, Smalling again showed he's no leader. Not that we didn't know that.

1473~~~
Most of them are strangers.

1474~~~
Maybe he could have started with calming players on the pitch after the second / third goals?

Granted that he went after the referee after the second goal and after Blind/Smalling after the third. However, he should have know then that it's the most important time to stay cool and keep possession. As a <i>captain</i> he had to do that. If panic set in after the goals, he was the one who should really have had a word with people. Doesn't really help if you are irate as a leader in such situations, only helps winding everybody up.

1475~~~
I really don't think Rooney is capable of that. He's a hot head who does not lead by example. Whilst Keane was also the former, he could do the latter.

1476~~~
Rooney was playing as a our most attacking midfielder. If you're trying to have a whine about his lack of defensive effort you're coming across as more than a little clueless tbh. Not to mention that, as I have already pointed out, he seemed to be more involved in defending than any other attacking player.

And yes it's easy to comprehend what a captain's responsibility is, thanks. This includes reminding players of their responsibilities and standards expected of them. I don't know if you've ever played football (I suspect not) but that will often take the form of shouting at the, rather than some sort of gentle word in the ear. Exactly what we regularly saw from players like Keane and Schmeicel and exactly what has been conspicuously lacking from United in recent years.

1477~~~
Thought he was mediocre. A mixture of a few great passes, a few horrendous first touches that caused the opposition to re-group, a few good defensive contributions and a few stupid mistakes (such as for their 3rd).

Bollocking the defense is absolutely fine, but I'd like to see him leading by example. A quality captain for instance goes up to Herrera and tells him to calm down after his first hoof upfield post meltdown, rather than losing their head and starting to run around like a headless chicken. I'd like to see him apply a bit of intelligence and composure (in the form of a bollocking if needed), rather than just ranting, raving and losing his own head.

1478~~~
I do play football at a higher level than you'll ever play, thank you. I also happen to have been captain of my team on numerous occasions.

And I'm all for giving away bollockings - but only after you yourself have done your job at a good level, taken care of your responsibilitites - running around shouting at everyone and losing your head isn't leadership, it's immaturity.

I'm not whining about his lack of defensive effort. I'm whining about his lack of leadership and ability to calm things down when shit started to hit the fan. Five minutes of calm, composed play with the added threat of hitting Leicester on the counter would've killed that game off even after the 2-3 goal.

I know you've got this urge to be contrary to most other opinions, but I'm completely agreeing with finneh's post here. He should've had a word with the players as soon as we went 2-3 up not turning into Shrek and shouting at everyone. You surely can't believe he kept calm and did his job after 2-3 went in? He completely lost it and his game went to shit. He was a contributing factor to the meltdown, not hindering it.

1479~~~
Captain, no-Captain, screaming, shouting, whatever... Frankly, all I'm arsed about is that, as a footballer, Rooney - like everyone else, totally lost it after they got that penalty. There was no calmness to his play, and he was seemingly charging around like a bit of a loon... it wasn't helpful to the situation we were in, but he wasn't the only one.

Then you bring in the Captain thing and you think, yeah, maybe he should have been the guy to calm everyone down a bit - bring order... and he should be, but really, LVG is the man who should have done something - especially when it got to 3-3. We should have been keeping it calm for 10/15 then pushing for a late winner.

1480~~~
Never a surprise to see Pogue defending anything Rooney does and any of his performances are immune to criticism. It was a shit clearance. Absolute shit. If any defender done it then you would be pretty annoyed at them. Just clear it out of play, anywhere but right back into the danger zone. All he did afterwards was lose his head.

1481~~~
I'm curious to know how anyone on here would know whether that happened or not?

Obviously, the bollocking is obvious as it's smack bang in the middle of all the replays of that goal. I have absolutely no idea about whatever other quiet words he was or wasn't having with team mates. I suspect you don't either.

1482~~~
The thing is, it's not really the time for a bollocking is it? You were winning 3-1 ten minutes ago, shit has hit the fan and now you're at 3-3... now, I'm no psychologist, but I would imagine that at this point you'd want everyone to take a deep breath and calm the feck down. Keep it simple, don't do anything stupid and get back into a winning position...  who knows, Rooney's ranting and raving could well have contributed to the fact that our players started to charge forward like moronic maniacs after that point.

But then I'm not a professional football, so feck knows what they respond to.

1483~~~
He's not really captain material, never been one but this captaincy lark is overstated. You shouldn't need someone tellng you to calm things down, it should be fecking obvious.

That said there's no better choice than Rooney so he's captain by default.

1484~~~
The fact that Herrera went on to imitate the behavior two more times without Rooney bollocking him would suggest either he did not say it, or he said something and was wholly ignored. However if Rooney warned him after his first panicked hoof, then he would have absolutely destroyed him after the second or third I'm sure.

1485~~~
I just want to say that I have no issue with Rooney giving it to the defenders. So add me to that side of the argument.

1486~~~
What about when he played Blackett short twice with bad passes which in turn gave Leicester 2 dangerous free kicks, and his bad clearance that led to the goal where he decided to have a go at everyone else? Needs to take responsibility for his own actions before blaming everyone else I think.

1487~~~
He does need too. I would like to think he did after the match or someone else on the match let him know. That doesn't mean he is not allowed to tell other players when they are making mistakes though. It is his job as captain.

1488~~~
I'm normally very much in the anti-Rooney camp, and while I felt his performance wasn't great yesterday and the lack of Mata created an unbalance in the team, I feel the need to defend some of the captaincy criticism levelled at Rooney. So here goes...

Time for context:

1) Rooney is a new captain, he hasn't had time to experience and develop a type of leadership he's happy with yet. That takes anybody time. What worked for Roy Keane 15 years ago might not work today. We can't expect the same. He's just an (overpaid) lad that lost the ball away and was frustrated with himself and those around him and chose to warn everyone with the first emotion that came to mind, anger. At least he did something.

2) A continuation of point 1, the new players may all require different types of leadership too. They have all come from different cultures. He shouted to get a reaction, right or wrong, in that split second many of you reading this and many players would have done the same.

3) Had United claimed victory again after the 3-3 shout, he'd have been applauded for showing passion for United (finally). We didn't, it was on TV, he gave the ball away for the goal directly before it, as such it's now viewed as a negative.

----

The match is done now. What's happened has tragically happened and it can't be undone or analysed beyond what we have already discussed on this thread already. Let's see how Wayne does in the next test and judge that effort then. For all we know, he could be sat in Carrington with his arms around the new lads encouraging them and re-enforcing the standards of the club, the expectations on them and what's needed to move forward.

1489~~~
The shouting at players: doomed if does,doomed if he doesnt. Wayne cant win on that front.

1490~~~
How is bollocking everyone - when they're all clearly shitting their pants - in any way helpful?

People keep saying "Well Keane did it all the time etc. etc." but, and correct me if I'm wrong here, Keane rarely shouted at people after conceding a goal. He'd generally bollock players for mistakes that didn't lead anywhere, probably because he knew they needed some sort of wake-up call/jolt.  After just conceding though, he'd generally encourage... largely because that's what's needed at that time.

1491~~~
But that's a paradox isn't it? After it went to 3-3, we were still incredibly edgy, people were charging around the field and there was no calmness in our play. Whilst I'm not saying Rooney's shouting made everyone do that, it's hardly going to calm everyone down is it?

1492~~~
Very true but it's one of those typical moments in football, once it's shown on TV, if it works it's applauded if it doesn't it's wrong. He could have had quiet words with some of the players after our 3rd goal or their 2nd too, I don't know, but if he did then the shouting and frustration would be understood. It wasn't on TV so it won't get discussed, only those that were there and saw it may know.

1493~~~
Dunno about Keane but Schmeicel was usually at his most vocal after we conceded.

Anyway, this whole "role of a captain" stuff is being made too much of. Yes, Rooney probably wasn't the calming influence we needed but there are all sorts of different leadership styles and he's obviously better suited to firing people up than calming them down. The specific bollocking was richly deserved though and must have come from the previous 10 minutes of shambolic defending, culminating in that absolutely absurd situation of Blind and Smalling getting in each other's way during what should have been a routine clearance. Smalling should have absolutely smashed Blind to get a decent header on the ball but ended up doing a pathetically half-arsed effort. We were defending like pussies, so maybe they needed to be fired up a bit, so they could start winning a few physical battles? 

In the grand scheme of things it probably made very little difference in terms of helping us defend better but if the delicate flowers in our back four are going to collapse mentally because they got shouted out then our problems run deeper than I thought.

1494~~~
That's sort of where I am - his ranting and raving most likely didn't help - but really, it was just his general performance... not as a captain, but as a footballer playing for Manchester United... in those last 20 or so minutes that I'm more bothered about, he completely lost the plot... but then all our players did in one way or another.

I wouldn't be suprised if these lot crumble after a bit of shouting though - we shit our pants as soon as the slightest thing goes wrong at the moment - so really, it's probably likely hat they don't respond all that well to a bollocking. We're a team of fecking pussies at the moment.

1495~~~
The most concerning thing for me about Rooney's performance was not his shouting, or his clearance, it was the fact that as the #10 picking up the holding man is his duty. He was berated for not doing this against Pirlo in 2012, he was berated for not doing this against Busquets in 2011, and he has never shown any real understanding of this part of playing #10. Cambiasso advanced to the edge of the box to smash home Leicester's third unimpeded. 

Rooney, like the rest of them, lost his head. He started chasing the ball instead of chasing the men. As Van Gaal said, our defensive organisation from the front backwards fell apart at 3-2. Rooney's not to blame for that, although you can make your arguments about what the captain's job is there, but I worry about him as a #10. I think he should be played in a front two with one of Van Persie or Falcao being sacrificed. There Rooney will have more freedom and less responsibility. After Mata went off against QPR our diamond collapsed and the same things could be seen throughout the game yesterday, especially once we lost momentum. 

IMO Van Gaal is mismanaging Rooney and his other attackers.

1496~~~
He's not a defender. Shit happens, get over it. Much worse defensive errors were made by the defence

1497~~~

1498~~~
I think he will be okay as a captain, I don't think the role is that important. He needs to step up his game as a player. He's full of mistakes, which is why I think he gets more criticism than someone like RVP.

1499~~~
beginning to think that we've seen the best of Rooney already, hope im wrong

1500~~~
Think that has been pretty obvious for over a year. If he wasn't captain he'd be at risk of being dropped.

1501~~~
My biggest problem with him in the #10 role is his ball distribution. He's somehow bent on sending it to the wings ( funnily enough, when he's sent a through ball through the middle he got an assist ). With diamond, problem is that he's then stretching our midfield too much - Herrera and ADM go to the wings to create an advantage with our fullbacks and that leaves midfield wide open just with Blind. While it's a necessity to sometimes play it through the wings, I think that given quality we've got and the diamond system itself we're using, we should be unlocking defences in the middle of the park, right in front of the 16 yard box.

This was missing yesterday. Our most threatening attacks and 2 goals came through the middle - there was a huge gap between de Laet and their right centre back that we've exploited for first goal ( Falcao breaking through, that goal came from a wing though ), then di Maria's goal - a through ball that sent him between the two, Herrera goal - again, between RdL and their right centre-back. Now, ADM's through ball to RVP that should've been converted to make it 1-0 went through the same channel, Rooney's lobbed through ball to Falcao, whose shot met the crossbar, got to the exactly same spot Herrera scored his goal from. 

There was literally one or two attacks that were dangerous from the wings, one was Falcao's cross and second was some cross by Rafael that was met by nobody ( and iirc it ended with Herrera's goal after ADM set him up, again, through the middle ). But Rooney, due to our previous playstyle that relied on wings, seems to insist on sending the ball to the wings far too much. Thinking about goals that struck us, nearly all happened in the same manner - a winger is gifted a lot of space on the wing and he's free to cut inside and simply run with the ball on goal or cross it. First, second ( penalty incident came from the wing ), fourth and fifth goals - all started on the wings, because - imo - we were too stretched. 

Of course when everybody started panicking and shitting themselves, we decided to drop the midfield completly and simply hoof it to Falcao/Rooney/RVP/Januzaj who were forced to the wings and then neutralised by Leicester's defenders. I imagine that in the perfect diamond, it's the strikers and fullbacks who drift wide ( feck you FIFA ) and the midfielders stay more compact in the middle - this allows them to stretch when hit on a counter and neutralise it. I do believe that Mata is simply more suited to this role, he's not afraid of playing quick one-two with other attackers through the middle ( was visible numerous times against QPR ) and doesn't spray it to wings as often.

tl;dr - if Rooney's to play the #10, he <b> has to </b> stop spraying it to the wings.

1502~~~
Only if you're an idiot. Try and think who played the pass that led to both those chances?

(aimed at the blogger, not you)

1503~~~
Whether Rooney had quiet words or just gave that bollocking is irrelevant for me, although it's highlighted as he's the captain. Everybody on the pitch is capable of having a quiet word with the bloke beside them and going 'hang on we need to calm down a bit here, keep the ball and kill their momentum'. Having a few players/leaders like that is far more important than the role of one person.

EDIT: It's also worth noting that a lot of these players are new to each other in football terms and so communication and understanding is not exactly top notch at the moment. That should improve with time.

1504~~~
Pogue's argument is ridiculously biased. Of course they play like strangers -they are and one week training didn't change that. It was Smalling's first appearance and Blind's second period. Half the team doesn't even speak English much less Northern English. 

Rooney as captain should have been settling things at 3-2 and even more at 3-3. Maybe asking the manager or Giggs if they should defend at 3-1  instead of the gung ho naivety we saw from all including him to score more. Instructing Ander to stay deeper to help the tiring Blind and the same with Rojo who was leaving Blackett alone vs Vardy. 

He is the captain,  yet the only time we see him issuing instructions is after an equaliser he had a big hand in. 

If he hasn't lost his experienced head like the rest of them we could have had a draw at least. If one person is not allowed to lose their shit it's him.

1505~~~
With the captains armband would it be time for Rooney to sacrifice playing upfront for a deeper (and more influential) role in midfield? Seems it might be worth a punt because at this rate we will be running Di Maria into the ground.

Still think this team will come good though. Too much talent not to improve and once the team starts to gel the defensive solidarity will get better. I just hope Rooney can somehow regain his pace (and touch) if he is playing behind the strikers.

Not bothered at all about the bollocking he gave. I think that's taken out of proportion. He was frustrated just like the rest of us and we were really poor in our desire to win 50/50 balls.

1506~~~
LVG on Rooney

1507~~~
He doesn't have the ability to play in midfield, his passing and touch is suspect and he doesn't have the calmness about his play to survive at the top level midfield.

1508~~~
Lol, but, but...Rooney, nobody can do what he does, he can't be replaced....its impossible.. Hahaha

If you think Mata can't do what Rooney did with those 2 passes and I'd even go to say Mata would create and provide far more chances than Rooney then guess who's the........ and before you point out Mata is weak and got caught out on the ball, i don't want to see him in a deeper position but only as a #10 behind the strikers

1509~~~
We'd be way more open defensively with mata in there instead of Rooney. Anyways, our attack wasn't a problem at all, we played probably our best attacking football since the start of 11/12 in these last couple of games. Our only problem was not being able to keep it tight at the back. We scored 3 and made chances to score a few more at least, the forwards did their job.

1510~~~
LvG is in for a disappointment here since Rooney is worse as a midfielder than he is as a striker.

1511~~~
The team as a whole attacks and defends. Our tactics made it relatively easy for the forwards to do their job and very difficult for the defenders to do theirs. The team was very unbalanced. With another system of play our defense wouldn't have looked out of its depth. For instance, Chelsea don't play with 2 strikers, let alone with two strikers and another striker pretending to be a proper midfielder.

1512~~~
Even so, mata does next to nothing defensively so it's not really fair to say we would have been better with mata in for rooney. You could argue we would have kept the ball better but we would have been even more open on the break imo.

1513~~~
He's being paid that much for his marketability. English, Manchester United, Striker and famous.

1514~~~
I'm with you on that. The least they deserved.

1515~~~
Too much being made out of his shouting.

What I think is more relevant is rooney as a number 10. Its just not ideal. While I think that upto the hour mark it was one of his better performances there, we would so much better off with someone who is genuinely excellent technically. Rooney's love for getting involved is all well and good but I think he needs to be played as a striker. If weve lost control of a game then given his touch under pressure, he's not the right number 10 to get your ball possession sorted again. He's more likeLy to mess up moves due to a heavy touch. He is however likely to put one in the back of the net, and that's why he needs to be played as a striker.

1516~~~
I generally make an effort to avoid this thread, but I succumbed today <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>. I have nothing against Rooney the person anymore, but I think Rooney the player is tactically and technically inferior to all our other starting options in the entire front six. I hope I'm wrong, he's now our captain after-all, but I can't see a way to have a cohesive and united team (pun intended) with him as a guaranteed starter. Here's to hoping he somehow regains his peak form.

1517~~~
Was thinking, wouldn't Herrera make the best no10 of all of our options? Good vision, looks like he's got a goal in him, can drop into midfield naturally and got the engine and defensive discipline that (mata for example lacks) comes with playing in midfield.

1518~~~
Personally, I think that only 2 out of Rooney, Falcao, RvP and Mata have to start in the more difficult games, especially away. Otherwise, the team lacks a proper ballance. I prefer Mata to Rooney since I regard him as a better No 10 but I'd agree that right now there isn't much between their performances. Rooney is physicall stronger, runs further than Mata and seems to be a more natural leader. But Rooney runs all over the pitch and doesn't help the team to keep shape, IMO. And technically he isn't just good enough to be the No 10 of one of the leading clubs in the world. Watch LvG getting dissatisfied with Rooney over the course of the season.

1519~~~
Have to laugh at Rooney dishing it out to the defenders after the 3rd goal, as he was the culprit because of his poor clearance.

1520~~~
"Idiots! You made me look bad!"

1521~~~
Has his giving away of the ball for Cambiasso's goal (3-3) been highlighted here?

Why does HE then go mental at everyone else?

1522~~~
*Read thread next time*

1523~~~
Btw I have a sneaking suspiscion that in fact LVG doesn't rate Rooney.

I think he's talking him up as a direct challenge to him to start performing.

Stating that he isn't happy with Rooney as a striker is about as much as a man can openly criticise the man who means too much. Rooney certainly isn't a better number 10 than Mata is, yet LVG seemed to criticse him too.

I dunno - I still have the feeling we'll play better without Rooney, but that we missed the boat where selling him is concerned and now have to continually challenge him and massage his ego to get any value out of his huge contract.

I wonder what Louis really makes of some of our players.

1524~~~
After LVG's recent comments it may take a run of games with Rooney malfunctioning at no.10 to sort this shit out once and for all. He doesn't have the game to play there. He's either a striker or you bench him as far as i'm concerned.

1525~~~
Yep, it's an interesting and strange comment at the same time by LvG that not only did he say that he wasn't that satisfied with Rooney as a striker, but also stated that Falcao would be more suitable there. 

LvG really has a job to do now, because even if you take Mata out of the equation (and let's be honest, Mata being the nice guy he is, won't even moan too much), LvG still needs to keep all 3 strikers happy.

1526~~~
His being payed that much cos of Moyes, if SAF was still here he would have sold him off by now!

I'm not his biggest fan but will admit that his a hard worker on the pitch.

1527~~~
Actually, he's being paid that much because he's been a hugely important player for one of the biggest/wealthiest clubs in the world for 10 years already and recently signed a new long term contract.

1528~~~
he's also easily the most marketable player we have and I'm sure that plays a part.

1529~~~
We still moaning about Wayne then, yeah?

1530~~~
It's chicken and egg. The best players at any big club tend to be the most marketable.

Unless you think he's marketable on the basis of his good looks?

1531~~~
Well, I suppose because he's been the face of England since he burst on the scene as a teenager has played a part too. He's also the third highest earning footballer in the world in terms of advertising (behind Neymar and Messi) which doesn't accurately reflect his ability in contrast (Or Neymar's). Definitely how good you are plays a huge part but so does the stature of the player in their country and their previous reputation, not to mention his private relationship is in fact very public too.

1532~~~
There's two elements to it. The player and the club. Best player at biggest club = massive marketability. Don't think there's much more to it than that.

If Ronaldo was still at United he's be absolutely miles more marketable than Rooney.

EDIT: Is Ronaldo really fourth in that list you mentioned? Wtf? Madrid need to sack someone in their marketing department...

1533~~~
Nah, I think LVG definitely rates Rooney quite highly. There's setting out a challenge to a player where you think they might improve, but if you're going out and making someone captain when you've got plenty of top talents in attack and play him regularly as a central figure to the team, then it's fairly clear that LVG rates him highly and has faith in him.

1534~~~
(Rooney = Commercial revenue - ££££££££'s) shhhh.... don't tell anyone

1535~~~
Rooney is better than RvP and on par with Falcao. Manager just need to use him as striker.

1536~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> He made him captain and revealed he has special privileges?

1537~~~
That was an old list actually, most recent ones state Ronaldo as #1.

Anyway, my point wasn't a negative, we pay Rooney so much in part <i>because </i>he is so valuable to us in terms of marketability and advertising too, and yeah, that's as a direct consequence of what he's achieved here. I'm pretty sure I've read certain reports stating portions of that 300k figure are reliant on shirt sales and advertising etc too.

1538~~~
As many others have said, we don't have players who are more senior at United than him. He basically had no choice if you ask me and even if you think he did, then I would suggest that this is another ploy to get better performances out of Rooney.

1539~~~
But if we exclude that, and what he said, and what he does, it's almost obvious he doesn't rate Rooney.

1540~~~
Of course he had a choice, you really think van Gaal would have made him captain had he not rated him? No chance.

1541~~~
Indeed. 

It's obvious Rooney'll never win some over, but sure it's there loss...

1542~~~
Yep, I do.

Make RVP captain and you piss off Rooney. He's a temperamental hot head and too much of a primadonna - much like Ronaldo, who I'd also consider to be the last man I'd make a captain.

1543~~~
Well then you're blinded by hate.

1544~~~
Don't be so fecking daft. I don't rate him as much as others do as a footballer (he's not in Ronaldo or Messi league by a long long way) and I certainly don't rate him as a captain. I don't know him, so how could I hate him?

It's daft to bandy a word like that about frankly. I could say you're blinded by unrequited love though.

1545~~~
How does the primadonna characteristic of Rooney actually manifest itself? I've seen nothing particularly like that on the pitch.

1546~~~
van Gaal is a manager unconcerned with agitating players for the good of the team, we know this, this is fact. Yet you suggest he made Rooney captain because he was wary of upsetting him?
van Gaal has, on more than one occasion, complimented Rooney. He's also made him captain, something of high importance to van Gaal, yet you suggest he doesn't actually rate him?

1547~~~
I think before LVG even came to Utd he had worked out Rooney and would have realized that due to the latter's status in England he would have to be cautious and smart in handling him. How LVG handles Mata as well as any further signings will truly reveal LVG's plans for Rooney.

1548~~~
You can upset him perhaps a month or two after he's shown you he's not got what you want. You can't do that right at the begining of the season.

1549~~~
Eh? If Van Gaal's that precious about the feelings of players he doesn't rate then we really are screwed.

Doesn't seem the type though, thankfully.

1550~~~
He needs to have proper justification is what I am saying. I would imagine United board also know no one his interested in Rooney and we will not be selling him any time soon so we need to get the most out of him.

1551~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> so utterly stupid.

Play him as one of the two uptop, please.

1552~~~
So the board are interfering with team selection and van Gaal's decision making?

1553~~~
It wouldn't surprise me in the least. I doubt it's uncommon anywhere. It'll be nothing compared to what the Bayern board did when he was there.

1554~~~
*Slowly backs away from thread*

1555~~~
Yeah, I don't think you actually said anything I disagree with.

Mainly responding to one or two of the thread's resident loons who keep bleating about him only being paid/picked because of his "marketability". The inference being that this is somehow distinct to what he delivers on the pitch.

1556~~~
Once again, I would conclude that if your suspicions are correct then we're screwed, no matter what any of our thoughts might be on Rooney.

I doubt they are correct, though. Don't think Van Gaal would stand for that shit.

1557~~~
Coleen, is that you?

1558~~~
Ronaldo, is that you?!

1559~~~
Before Van Gaall arrived, all anyone could talk about (rather gleefully I might add) was how Van Gaal would come here and drop Rooney in favour of RVP and how he would realise that Wayne Rooney was in fact shit at football. This was all based on Van Gaal's reputation of dropping players if he didn't like them and not giving a shit about the boardroom.

Of course Van Gaal came in and made Rooney his captain and by all accounts seems to rate him very highly. You would think at this stage some people would rethink their ridiculous opinions on Rooney but no we're back to the board dictating Van Gaal's team selections.

The lengths people go to to blame Rooney is quite astonishing.

1560~~~
LVG has already stated that he's not good enough to be apart of the front 2 and also said Rooney prefers to play behind them as a #10. Then goes on to say he wasn't happy with Mata as a #10. Looks to me LVG is trying to fit Rooney in as he knows himself Rooney's days of a top striker are over and we all know Mata is the better #10. I don't like this 1 bit. Again Rooney is having a say in decisions on the pitch which I don't like. I don't want this to happen with any player. (Basically LVG telling Rooney he's not good enough to play upfront and Rooney saying well then I will play behind them = tell Mata to f-off - in simple terms).
Right now I hope we change formation to 4-3-3 with 2 wingers, play 1 of Valencia/Young/Januzaj or bring back Nani from loan, i dont care how but it must be done so we don't have accommodate all the highest earners on the pitch at the same time (if Mata can be dropped then so should any of Rooney, Falcao or RVP be able to). It would be better if we had 1 of RVP/Falcao at ST, 1 of Rooney/Mata at #10 and bench the other 2 so we can bring on some quality off the bench when needed. Performance and form should determine who starts and no player should be give more privileges than any other. This will then show the true class of these players and which player rightfully deserve a place at UTD.

1561~~~
When you look at the players available when LVG made his decision of Captaincy, its not surprise is it there wasn't much choice, ffs he made Fletcher Vice captain, once Carrick is back we will never see him again. Its quite simple at the time of his decision he made his 2 most senior players <b>*available</b> Captain and Vice Captain.

Edit: *

1562~~~
AFter the worldcup, everybody was assuming that RvP has a fair shot at the Captaincy, so Rooney was by no means the only choice. 

RvP is a shadow of his former self for the last two years and his worldcup wasnt great either. He lost all his pace. He plays like a poacher; his touch is still great but helps him little if he cant move away from defenders. He´ll still score a decent amount of times if the service is good and he´ll add some spark of genius 2-3x a season but he doesnt offer much more. If you want to field an out and out striker Falcao is just better at the moment.

For some reason Rooney seems to believe that he is a Zidanesque midfielder, which is nonsense. He is decent, but his touch is slightly too heavy and he is just not intelligent enough for this role. That said his finish is quality, his hold-up is great, his workrate is good and he is always trying to get involved, which makes him a great #9 and a good all-rounder. 

If I would play with just one forward I´d chose between Falcao and Rooney. Falcao as out-out goalscorer and Ronney as someone who is more involved in holdup/playmaking and with better workrate. Both have their benefits.

If you want to play with two striker its Rooney+Falcao/RvP. I´d never pair two player like RvP and Falcao. They want to operate in exactly the same area and wait for the same balls. They are too similar. Against Leicester Falcao can still shift to the wings and make things happen because he is much better than any of the defenders (=assist for RvP). Good opponents will render him useless in this area. 
Rooney is at least decent as support striker and offers a lot of different things, even so non of them might be top quality. In the end he was always able to get a good amount of goals and assists.

1563~~~
You could argue that De Gea should've had a decent shout at being captain. Not incredibly experienced, but he's already established himself as a first teamer, plays regularly, is fairly professional and was one of our best players last season. There was definitely a lack of competition for Rooney, but he wasn't the sole credible candidate.

1564~~~
What about the fact he's been widely criticised for not being able to organise the defenders in front of him and be a commanding presence? And that he moved here 3 years ago so probably can't speak English that well?

Being a regular starter isn't the only criteria for being captain...

I think the sole reason people aren't happy with Rooney being captain is because of the worry he'd be cemented in the starting line up, even when starting RVP/Falcao/Mata would be better. However true this is, he's clearly the best option for the captaincy right now. England have trusted him with it too!

1565~~~
Never held Rooney back.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

But seriously, I think he's become a little bit more of a commanding presence in the past season or two since his game has generally improved in general, even if he's not had an excellent start to the season.

It's not that he was a better choice, more that Rooney wasn't the only viable option for captaincy, so wasn't just given it completely out of merit. It seems that LVG does hold him in fairly high esteem.

1566~~~
From his FB, from 20 minutes ago: There seems to be a lot of people who have written us off because of Sundays result but I don't see it that way. When I look around our dressing room and see the quality we have and the managers unbelievable attention to detail I have no doubts this team will be successful.

1567~~~
No way DDG would have been considered for captaincy. If not Rooney, then Van Persie takes precedence.

1568~~~
We can't say what SAF would have done and please let's not blame everything about last season on David Moyes. How do you know it was up to him? It was most probably a decision from the board based on his marketability and all.

1569~~~
I'm slowly growing to love Wayne again, not ashamed to admit it.

1570~~~
His being payed that much cos of Moyes, if SAF was still here he would have sold him off by now!

I'm not his biggest fan but will admit that his a hard worker on the pitch.
We now cos SAF was about to sell him as Rooney asked for a transfer. Moyes came in and openly admitted that he wants Rooney to stay and treated it like a achievement that he convinced him to stay!


So with a big wage comes big demand, if you can't handle the heat get out the kitchen and Rooney in my opinion should have left the house let alone the kitchen.....!

1571~~~
So you stopped loving him at some point ? Shame On You!!!

1572~~~
I never want to see him as the #10 again, but I sadly think that's how we will set out in most games, with him behind RvP and Falcao

1573~~~
If only writing good stuff on Facebook (Rooney) or saying good stuff in press conferences (LvG) would win us games, eh?

1574~~~
Why are people still banging on about him playing as the number ten or whatever. We were good going forward and scored three away from home. Rooney was not the problem. People can feck off about he is in danger of being dropped.

Yes Mata is a good player. Him playing instead of Wayne would have changed nothing though.

1575~~~
His power from the 10 is just much better utilized when RVP is in the side. RVP tends to drop wide and run off the shoulder and when Wayne and a 10 are playing Wayne drops way to far back and gets trapped between the circle and the box almost in no mans land. He either needs to be withdrawn from the start or has to have the person playing at 10 removed for it to work in a balanced way.

He's almost like a box to box midfielder but doesn't play exclusively between the boxes. More of a pushed up box to box player that occasionally returns to the edge of the area but when we have the ball and are up the field he arrives late.

1576~~~
He's not in danger of being dropped because he's undroppable. LVG said so don't you know.

1577~~~
Quality managers don't usually drop players that are playing well.

1578~~~
From our attackers trio at the moment (Rooney, RVP and Falcao) Rooney is the one play the best from the three of them so far this season. So obviously he shouldn't be dropped but still didn't play good enough for our quality and far from expectation.

1579~~~
Last time he played well was before Christmas last season...

1580~~~
Oh right, I just noticed that it was you who posted that. Yeah, alright - for sure.

1581~~~
I reckon Evans would've been second choice. LVG stated the captain must be home grown, or at least have English as their first language I assume.

1582~~~
I still don't think so. Evans did not even break into first team regularly. Last season it was still Vidic there as captain and this season, injury and horrible form afterwards, no way he would have been a captain. Robin being captain of Arsenal & Dutch team definitely is more worthy.

1583~~~
Yes but Van Gaal is a man who does things his way, so if he strongly believes that the captain should be a British/home grown player then that's what will happen. I admire him for that, and in a way agree, but I also think that if there was a stronger leader in the squad (younger Vidic) then of course he would've been chosen as captain.

1584~~~
Don't get what this has to do with the Leicester game. We created enough to score 3 goals away from home. Very rarely will you score three and not win.

1585~~~
It was a game where he didn't play up front. Where it was obvious that him coming off the front line to create from deep was clogging up Mata playing at the 10. Probably what Van Gaal mentioned as to why he didn't think Rooney should start up front.

1586~~~
I think Rooney needs to be put up front again in all honesty, probably along with Falcao on current form.

With the current formation we have Di Maria providing width on the left from central midfield and I feel Rooney as a forward could drop to the right when the ball is going down that channel. He wouldn't have the defensive responsibilities of a winger as Herrera/Blind would provide the cover, but he'd provide the attacking outlet on the right which we seem to have been missing lately. We've also been exposed on the right as Rafael has ended up with no-one ahead of him, so has ended up playing 1-2's inside and carrying on his runs. 

I'm not Rooney's greatest fan, but he has the engine to regularly peel off centre and provide an option on the right hand side in front of Rafael, while Mata and Herrera always provide an option inside. The problem with playing Rooney behind is that he regularly finds himself in an area of the pitch that isn't conjunctive to a tactical unit, sometimes this is to our benefit as he might be covering our full backs, but often it can be at the expense of cohesion.

<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

This fecking thread. Seems like every page there's at least two posts from a parallel universe. Demented.

1588~~~
I've seen this guy spouting utter dirge about Rooney before. Demented is definitely right.

1589~~~
From Marcotti:

Anyone's got a GIF of the same?

Also noticed that the almost-assist for Falcao's super strike against the bar was by Rooney - a pretty chip too (Not sure how to embed GIFs here)

1590~~~
Wow. I find myself in the unusual position of being aligned with Marcotti's opinion.

I wonder who Rooney ran past tracking back for that goal...

1591~~~
Yeah, that is why I want to look at that GIF.. Wondering from where he ran back and past who

1592~~~
Marcoti's argument is very weak. It's like the "he can play left-back!!" argument.

1593~~~

1594~~~
It's not an argument. He's pointing out one of his qualities.

If I wanted to have an "argument" about why Rooney's such an important player, I'd probably highlight other qualities, such as his record in the league last season of a goal or assist per game. Something he's very close to keeping up in this season so far. All as part of a team that has generally been miles below the standard you'd expect at United.

1595~~~
Blind and Smalling then. Blind just isn't very quick across the ground but a bit surprised that Rooney was that much quicker than Smalling. What with him being fat and old.

Blackett's defending looks worse and worse with each loop of that gif. What was he thinking? Dithering Dave doesn't exactly cover himself in glory either.

1596~~~
*pointless run*

1597~~~
It's a very (lazy)weak point from him nonetheless. Being able to run all the way back should have nothing do with how well you can play the #10 position.
But with that said, the attack wasnt the reason why we lost the game. In fact I  thought the attack looked quite dangerous before things went downhill due(in part) to some terrible decisions from the referee.

1598~~~
Smalling didn't look half as quick as some people make out. He has about 10 yards on Rooney (who isn't as quick as he once was) and still loses. Maybe he wasn't flat out but that doesn't really help matters...

1599~~~
How would you rank Rooney in terms of current strikers? Where on the list is he? For me, not including Messi/CR, I'd have:

Ibra
Suárez, Lewandowski
Aguero, RVP, Falcao
Cavani, Rooney
Benz/Costa/Neymar

1600~~~
Its ridiculous to criticize a forward for tracking back. This argument might have some merits, if you play with a single forward, but if you have two poacher upfront its exactly what the team needs. 
Against the popular believe, blackett doesnt make any major mistake; he has to move towards the man with the ball, beacuse Blind would have never been able to close him down. I have no clue why Smalling is that high up the pitch and I really wonder where Herrera is. That said you should never lose the ball in this situation.

1601~~~
He really doesn't. And certainly not that high up the pitch. He should have stayed goalside Vardy and only leave him close De Laet down as an absolute last resort, which wouldn't have been until he'd carried the ball another 20 0r 30 yards. Blind was actually level with De Laet when he first touched the ball. He could definitely have got involved if De Laet was forced to dribble the ball instead of playing a really simple pass.

1602~~~
You got to read the entire article to figure out what are his arguments. You cannot just quote one part and say that its a weak argument. For your benefit, I am pasting it here:

1603~~~
yes. thats true and you are right. That said Vardy´s ball is pretty good and blind would have never catched up. There are various different things that are way more concerning than a bad but understandable decision by a youngster.

1604~~~
Thank you so much <a class="username" data-user="61812, @Mrs Smoker" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/61812/">@Mrs Smoker</a> 

Rooney's top speed was the highest in the game against QPR, even higher than Di Maria. People say he has slowed down, but he still has some pace about him.

1605~~~
Right now I wouldn't have RVP at the same level as those players, as I'm beginning to think his current/recent form is now his current regressed level. And I'd definitely rank Costa higher.

Without thinking up any other names I'd rank those players roughly:
Suarez, Ibrahimovic
Costa, Aguero, Lewandowski
Cavani, Falcao
Benzema, Neymar, Rooney
RVP

Maybe I'm being pessimistic but Rooney and RVP are also the only two that I don't think are capable of reaching around the current level of Suarez and Ibrahimovic. Costa and Aguero could still improve if they stay injury free, Falcao (hopefully) could return to his pre-injury level, Cavani and Benzema could be even better if they were the main forward somewhere (like Arsenal), and Neymar still has years to progress. Whereas Rooney + RVP, great 2/3 years ago, but not in the top bracket anymore in my opinion.

1606~~~
I agree, plus Blackett's decision is understandable because there really was no one at the left back position where the run was being made.

1607~~~
Yeah, it seems really harsh to single out such a an inexperienced players when there were at least two other blatant errors from United players in the move. It was a rookie mistake but what else can you expect when you pick rookie defenders?

1608~~~
And what should he have done, according to you? The only thing which I can think of is spreading himself more because of being in a one-on-one

1609~~~
I'd have Suarez at least on par with Ibra at the top.

Aguero is better than Lewandowski but forever injured so it's tough. RVP and Falcao would've been higher up but neither is in great form and both coming back from injury hit seasons/summers.

Don't hugely rate Cavani but he is playing out of position.

We've no idea where Rooney's best position is anymore. He's not effective behind the striker for me but then he's not being given much of a shot up front by LVG who doesn't rate him there. The way his physical attributes have declined makes him hard to place anymore.

Costa is in stunning form at the minute, continuing what he did last year, if he carries on he'll be way up there near the top you'd imagine.

Neymar is tough because how well he does entirely depends on the mood Messi is in. If Messi continues to be the creative force rather than the finishing touch then Neymar will score more and his confidence will skyrocket. If Messi suddenly decides he wants to hunt down Cristiano for the Pichichi then Neymar will be on the periphery instead.

1610~~~
He should have been <i>at least</i> 5 or 6 yards closer to Vardy when he reached the edge of the box. I've already been moaning about that<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/david-de-gea-2014-2015-performances.394335/page-10#post-16506883"> in his own thread</a>.

Delaney gives his take on Rooney

1612~~~
Typically sensationalist click-bait. Rooney inevitably attracts this sort of stuff but it's annoying nonetheless.

Drop him? Has he not watched <i>any</i> of our games this season?

1613~~~
Don't think you can call Delaney that- he often makes very good arguments.

He has written a well thought out article I say- the headline is misleading though. The penultimate paragraph:

1614~~~
If the defenders don't learn from this,then they must be the thickest defenders in the PL. Smalling, Blind, Rojo all in the opposition half with only Blackett defending. If your going to go up the pitch, go as line and stay as a line. No tactical awareness at all from these players and worst of all no communication between them. You'd think Smalling, after playing with Ferdinand and Vidic would have learnt to open his mouth and get everyone into position but it seems like he doesn't even know where he's supposed to be playing on the pitch.

1615~~~
Woow Rooney is rapid, shame he doesnt use that for attacking qualities. Cant remember the last time he went past a defender.

1616~~~
There was a moment in the game when Di Maria had the ball on the left wing, and Rooney was seen in middle sprinting like a madman hoping for a pass in the box. Never arrived, but boy, he was fast. As fast as in above gif, if not faster.

1617~~~
He used it last week, when he sprinted the length of the pitch alongside Di Maria and ended up setting up a goal for Herrerra. That was presumably the sprint that had him logged as the quickest player on the pitch in that match.

The blind spots that Rooney seems to cause in so many caftards is just so hard to understand. Can't think of any other player with such relentless focus on every error combined with an almost wilful determination to ignore every positive contribution.

1618~~~
That wasnt half as quick as this. <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tGQmYaNE6kQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1619~~~
That Smalling's positioning boggles my mind every single time I see it.

1620~~~
I think that sprint looks slower because Di Maria is also very quick.

1621~~~
Could be, but you can also see in his way of running that he isnt at full speed.

1622~~~
Yeah, he only really sprints flat out over the last 5-10 yards. When he was getting back at Vardy it was full steam ahead from very early on.

1623~~~
I quoted another poster who had used it but can you deny that it was a weak point? .  Back to article, so basically he is saying that We cannot afford to do anything but start ROoney every game? Then again it's not like we didn't know the dangers of that contract the moment it was announced.

1624~~~
Exactly. 
For instance his pass for Herrera goal, I remember in match thread some posters were going about how his first touch was awful, very few mentioned he assisted Herrera and some even said every player would do that. 
Similar Di Maria's lob vs Leicester, maybe one or 2 posters mentioned his very good pass to Di Maria for that goal.. 

When there's a chance they criticise him, even when there isnt sthing they will find it or make it up but if he's very good its really hard for them to give him any credit.

1625~~~
I dislike Rooney and I've made that very clear on this forum, but if we are to stick with the 4312 then Rooney isn't part of the problem at all. He's the most mobile out of all our forwards and we need that most. His finishing is also excellent. He isn't a #10 and I'll argue that until I'm blue in the face, but I'd play him as one of our main strikers ahead of both Van Persie and Falcao going forward. The latter should partner him.

1626~~~
That's the problem, moments. The old Rooney, when we used to call him Roonaldo, could be expected to take most good balls and use his pace and handling to pass a couple of defenders and create something dangerous. These days his movement is much more erratic, and the only place you expect something to happen is in poacher spots.

1627~~~
On this subject of 'tracking back' and 'busting their arses to do as much as they can' does anyone else get the feeling that only Rooney really does this? A lot of times I see some of our players just give up and 'pull up stumps' after a shit piece of defending and let players in and/or shoot on goal.

Rooney busting his arse to get around the pitch just reminded me of how little I see that in other players. The 'Oh Shit!' panic move at the moment from the defenders seems to be 'Oh well, he's in now, there's nothing more I can do then.....' instead of just trying anything and everything to stop it. I've seen Blackett do it a few times but I am not sure, maybe I am getting it wrong but it reminded me of how little I've seen it.

1628~~~
Ibra, Suarez, Lewa, Aguero, Falcao (pre injury), Costa and Neymar are miles ahead of both Rooney and RvP if you consider their poor form in the last 18 months. Benzema is the one closest to them at the moment I would say and he is still young. Oh and I don't rate Cavani much.

1629~~~
It's good to see Rooney's commitment to the chase in that GIF. Not sure what was up with Smalling, maybe couldn't reach top speed because he wasn't 100% fit? It would be nice if United could let Rooney run 100m and let RedCafe record it so this whole 'Rooney is slow/fat/fast/lost a yard of pace' argument can be settled.

1630~~~
Hahaha, that is another matter altogether. Can I take liberty and blame David Moyes <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1631~~~
Anyone else feel he has been a bit more 'precise' with his game since the formation change?

By that I mean, he has two proper CM's behind him, di Maria who makes driving runs around him and two top forwards in front of him capable of hold up and dragging defenders away. Before he'd have to worry about being both di Maria and Falcao (if that makes sense), whilst also making up for Carrick's partner. This role suits him more with the increased options he has (Herrera, di Maria, Falcao) rather than him looking round and only finding a wide player in space. We are linking play better, we are passing it well etc and Rooney has looked good.

1632~~~
Yeah, he's looked pretty good these last couple of games in all honesty. Far better in that #10 role then he's looked for years/

The red card has come at such an annoying time.

1633~~~

1634~~~
That's pretty much how I feel about him. 

What's worse is he'll come straight back into the side after the suspension and it's almost a guarantee he won't be as match fit as he should be.

1635~~~
Couldn't give a damn about his personal life or his flaws (every player has them), he's a highly productive player and who the hell would not want that in their team?

1636~~~
I'd say Blackett running away from the center is more baffling. Knowing that he was the last man, he kept their CF onside, while trying to close down a player near the touchline. Or are you mistaken Blackett for Smalling?

1637~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1638~~~
Nah yeah, Blackett's position is pretty awful too but it's Smalling that's around 30th yard in their half, completly unnecessary then.

1639~~~
That Rooney gif reminds me of this clip.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QjKKMV8KgeE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Like Keane, Rooney is not known for his pace, but like Keane, he's pretty quick when he has to be

This video also serves as a reminder as to why I think Michael Owen is a little punk

1640~~~
Oh yeah, good point. Hadn't noticed that before I was so fascinated by Blackett's terrible decision. What the flying feck were the two of them doing so far apart? As the senior member of the pair I'm blaming Smalling. Woeful defending.

1641~~~
Rooney isn't as quick as he used to be. But he looks pretty nippy in those clips. He may be getting sharper. I don't think he had this kind of pace the last two seasons.

1642~~~
Rooney has shown, when playing behind two strikers, that he's still not the best as a #10 sort of player. He just doesn't have the close control and movement to be at his best in such a role. I feel like he'd be better off playing as the second striker off of Falcao as that will bring the best out of him. He can create chances and is a decent passer, but I don't feel like he has the vision, close control, and passing choices of a very good #10. Every time he plays here, he plays like a false 9 rather than as a #10.

1643~~~
Odd thing to say, considering that he played well these last 2 games...

Looks to me that although Mata is probably a better no. 10, Rooney is more fitted to play there behind 2 strikers, because it brings more balance to the team with his high workrate.

I'm not trying to say that he was bad or good. He was effective behind the two strikers, and it allowed him the freedom to move back and forth between midfield and the final third. Plus, it allowed him to be the least disciplined in his game and allow him to track back and support the team off the ball. However, I'm commenting more on his style of play than his performance quality.

He takes up very good positions behind the strikers, but he doesn't stretch teams with horizontal movement, something that's fundamental for attacking midfielders. Also, he needs to demonstrate the close control that can prevent us from slowing down our passing tempo and rhythm. Several times, I've noticed some of his bad touches slow us down quite a bit when we were on a good rhythm and tempo. Finally, he struggles in tight spaces, something attacking midfielders should be comfortable with. However, he's excellent at finding himself in open space, and that's something I would expect from false 9's/second strikres. Also, his passing and vision are good enough to link up with others and put through runners on goal or dangerous areas, but he's not someone who can dictate our tempo and passing rhythm. Finally, his finishing is an asset that cannot be suppressed in any way, and as a second striker/false 9, he can ghost into goalscoring areas or take up goalscoring positions.

It's similar to how I see Muller. He's played behind Gomez and Mandzukic many times for Bayern, but has this ever meant that he was an attacking midfielder? No, he was always playing like a second striker, but what makes him different from typical second strikers is that he is comfortable out wide unlike many second strikers nowadays.

Anyways, back to Rooney. Rooney does well behind the two forwards because his energy levels mean that he cannot be easily marked out of the game like Mata can, and we can play strikers who are clinical. Plus, having other great attacking players like di Maria and Herrera means that Rooney will only have to deal with 1 opposing marker most of the time. However, I believe we can be a better team if we have a more energetic, dynamic forward playing off of Falcao than van Persie. Rooney can play as he usually does right now, but by playing off of Falcao, we can be an even better team IMO rather than playing behind van Persie and Falcao.

1645~~~
Do you honestly think there's been a difference to how we've played since Rooney has played as a number 10? If so, in what way, because in my opinion, Rooney has played the number 10 role, (yes the number 10 because he's been dropping and linking up play - no different to how Mata plays) just as good as Mata in the couple of games he has played there so far.

1646~~~
Not having the Rooney criticism this year so far.....And believe me, I've gone to town on him plenty of times on this forum and wanted him gone.

But, his work rate, link up play, passing, vision and awareness has been top notch so far and he integrates brilliantly with Falcao, Di Maria or Mata....His performances this year have been very good.

Him being captain however, I can't stand. And thats even before I think of his past episodes.

But as a player, I hope he continues this form. I do think, however, it's yet another convenient time to get suspended

1647~~~
If you think I'm having a slight at Rooney, you're wrong. I'm saying that, even now, his game doesn't suit playing behind two strikers or playing a more midfield role. When Muller played behind Gomez and Mandzukic, who thought that he ever played as a #10 or midfielder?

With Rooney, it's the same thing. Yes, he's done well, I'm not saying he was bad. However, he can be more effective than this. Against Leceister and West Ham, Rooney was good and effective, and we had good periods of play in both matches with him behind two strikers. His vertical movement has created spaces in the middle that the likes of di Maria, Herrera, van Persie, and Falcao exploited well. His energy and work-rate made it difficult for the opposition to close him down. His decent vision also came to the fore against Leceister with a nice assist to di Maria. Rooney's also very good at keeping possession in midfield. In the past couple of matches, in our good periods, he still had issues with keeping close control of the ball in tight spaces, but he overcame those troubles, and I was satisfied with him behind the 2 strikers.

However, this doesn't mean that Rooney is at his best behind two strikers. He was always at his best playing off of 1 striker, no matter who it was. Unless van Persie can be more dynamic in his game, Rooney behind two strikers isn't our best option at the moment. I believe we're better off with Rooney playing off of Falcao in his usual way with someone dynamic who can provide some width on the right as well (Januzaj or Mata).

1648~~~
I think you're more focusing on the player, and not the role the player actually plays, though. Despite Rooney and Muller probably being strikers/second strikers for most of their careers, I don't think that means that they can't play the number 10 role, especially if they're doing the exact same job as a traditional number 10 does when playing behind the striker. I mean, like I said, Rooney has played in the exact same way Mata has in the last two games. 

Rooney may not be best behind two strikers, according to Van Gaal, Mata isn't either, but that's the role he's been given and so far, I feel he's been playing it pretty well. 

I did like the look of Rooney playing slightly behind Van Persie against QPR, but it seems that Van Gaal wants two out and out strikers, as opposed to one dropping off, as it was said that Van Gaal wasn't impressed with Rooney as a striker. That said, I'm still confused with that quote as since Rooney has dropped in behind the forwards, Falcao has kind off taken up the second striker role, which doesn't really suit him, in my opinion. I just feel it was an excuse to play RVP and Falcao.

1649~~~
I've never said that Rooney and Muller can't play the #10 role. Both can play it as some of their skill set can work well in that role. However, my point is that Rooney (and Muller) are better as a second striker (deep-lying forward) than as a #10.

From the matches I've seen, I've also concurred that Mata isn't the best player for the #10 role. He's not like Kagawa, Silva, Ozil, Cazorla, Wilshere, Oscar, and Fabregas in that he can dictate the tempo and rhythm of our passing. He's more about putting in the final pass or scoring goals, both of which formed as he played as a winger in his Valencia years. For this reason, I feel like, instead of having some proper #10 try to dictate play along with create chances, we have two free-role players hovering around in between the striker and midfielders. This prevents Rooney and Mata from having the burden of being playmakers. Besides, we have Herrera who can be our playmaker, and beyond him, we have players who can dictate play from deep in Blind and Carrick. Plus, we have Pereira coming up who can be our future playmaker along with Herrera.

Rooney was, is, and never will be a playmaker. He'll always be a free-role forward sort of player, and playing him in such a role will allow us to play at our best, whether that be behind one or two forwards. As I've mentioned earlier, if van Persie was more dynamic, I'd have no issues with Rooney behind two forwards. However, van Persie isn't like he used to be, so I'm proposing a better solution.

1650~~~
We now have an opportunity to see how well we perform without Rooney. Either way it will help to answer the debate on his best position within the team.

1651~~~
So who would you play behind the two forwards then?

1652~~~
Either Mata or Januzaj, but not as a strict attacking midfielder but rather more of a free right inside forward role. Rooney, then, would play in his favoured free forward role as part of a fluid front 3 with Falcao, Rooney, and Mata/Januzaj.

1653~~~

1654~~~
Saw this today and was quite impressed, as I rate Agüero massively. 
<b>Since 2011 in the Premier League:
Sergio Agüero:
Games:</b> 93
<b>Goals:</b> 56
<b>Assists:</b> 23
<b>Wayne Rooney:
Games:</b> 96
<b>Goals:</b> 56
<b>Assists:</b> 32

1655~~~
I think it's a bit overblown though. Pretty sure a lot more of Aguero's appearances have been as a substitute or he's been substituted due to injuries. His goals per minute ratio is comfortably better than Rooney's.

1656~~~
True, was surprised Rooney only managed three more games in the period, even with his annual injury, as Aguero is out every other week it seems.

1657~~~
Been discussed in another thread. Aguero has better goals/minute but their "goals or assist" rates are very similar. A goal/assist every 82 minutes from Aguero, and a goal/assist every 85 minutes from Rooney. Only fair to compare them on that basis as Rooney spent a good chunk of that time period playing in a deeper role.

Not to mention that he's been playing for a team that has generally created and scored much fewer goals over that same period of time.

1658~~~
Wow, and Rooney doesn't even play as the main forward!

1659~~~
Rooney did all that in 7799 mins, Aguero in 6482 mins.
That means Rooney has scored or assisted every 88.63 mins, Aguero every 82.05 mins. 
Oh and while I was at it, I did it for RvP, too, who according to transfermarkt in the same period has 102  PL goals and assists in 8526 mins, so he scores or assists every 83.59 mins, which puts him slightly behind Aguero.
And indeed on top form I'd put RvP just slightly behind Aguero.

1660~~~
To be fair, even then, those are some pretty good stats for someone who's often been perceived over that time period as not being at their best at all. Not that I'm agreeing/disagreeing with that assertion, but it's still an impressive set of stats, even if they flatter him more than Aguero.

1661~~~
Well it was never in doubt Rooney has good stats, but more or less all good strikers do. These stats just show that Aguero is still the best and tbf one doesn't even need stats to realise this.

1662~~~
Yeah, Aguero's been better for a while now and that gap will probably only continue to increase.

1663~~~
Actually, Rooney has more goals and assists over the same period of time so how is Aguero "the best"? Especially when you consider how Rooney played most of that time for a team that wasn't particularly creative, thanks to an under-strength midfield and out of form wide men.

A striker's ability to stay fit and available for selection is an important and under-rated attribute. Louis Saha would have probably been the best striker in Europe if he wasn't made of glass and Van Persie only really belonged with the elite strikers in Europe once he stopped being a  perma-crock for Arsenal.

1664~~~
Until recently I don't think I can recall Aguero taking any penalties, free kicks or corners for City which is understandable as Toure has been great at them.

I'd imagine a fair few of Wayne's goals and assists were from dead ball situations so that does scew the stat a bit.

1665~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> I posted earlier that Aguero played less minutes than Rooney and thus has a better goals+assists to mins ratio. He has a similar amount of games, but at times he scores and then gets injured in the 20th minutes or get subbed on in the 70th minute and still scores.
And we weren't that bad at creating chances, after all both Rooney's and RvP's stats with us are impressive.

Seriously even the most biased Rooney supporter should be able to see Aguero is the better player.

1666~~~
Different players with different characteristics, I think Aguero is more lethal and technically gifted, but Rooney as a better undestanding of the game and much more presence on the field, which allows him to cover other roles in a team, like playing out wide, being a number 10 or tracking back in midfield when the team needs it. Stats mean nothing at the end of the day really.

1667~~~
You seem to have missed my point.

At the end of the season, what matters most to the club is the total numbers of goals scored. It's the total goals/assists provided by individual players that affect league position, not goals/minute. Hence a striker who provides the most goals/assists in any given season is arguably a "better" player. A hypothetical total based on what someone <i>might</i> have scored if they injured less often means feck all.

Re the chances created by both teams, you'd have to have been living under a rock not to appreciate that City created a lot more chances than United did over that period of time. Rooney and RvP's stats were racked up despite the service they received, not because of it.

I do think Aguero's a brilliant player but he's over-rated by a lot of people on here to the same extent that Rooney is under-rated. Doesn't he have a fairly terrible record of scoring goals anywhere other than the Etihad?

1668~~~
It's not hypothetical, it's actual minutes played, not what might have been or something.

You "Rooney played deeper" argument doesn't have much weight eithet here, as Aguero himself still plays deeper at times. Not that much anymore, but Mancini used him a lot behind the striker or even on the wing in Aguero's first season at City, which was his best. Not to mention he was playing in a new league but needed no time to adapt. Which more than makes up for us apparently creating much less. Which I am not sure is true, even Chicharito scored many goals and we know he needs chances to score!

1669~~~
When he got loads of goals he didn't, that was kind of the point.

1670~~~
?

1671~~~
You still don't get it? Seriously!?

Player A scores 20 league goals, after playing 38 league games.

Player B scores 18 league goals but injuries mean he only features in 30 league games.

Which player has been the most valuable to his team?

Assuming we go with Player A (the  obvious answer) is it not reasonable to claim he was the "better" player in that particular season?

1672~~~
?? Aguero's stats ARE great despite his injuries. His injuries aren't even taken into consideration. And no, if Aguero plays he scores, but if he doesn't play then one of his team mates gets a chance. Whereas if Rooney plays but needs more mins to score, I don't know how he is that valuable then. 
It's not as City are playing with 10 men when Aguero gets injured.

1673~~~
Kun just doesn't have the stamina to last the whole game, unlike The Captain.

1674~~~
I'm always surprised that so many people ignore how important it is to simply have the player fit and available in every game. You'd think with our problems people would understand that better.

Aguero is obviously a class player, but over the course of the season, he'll score close to a goal a game but only play in around 30 games out of 50 in all comps. He's just so injury prone. You can't rely on him to be fit when you need him. Rooney on the other hand will normally play close to 50 games, score a similar amount of goals (so worse goals/min) but then rack up a lot more assists.

That extra playing time imo just makes rooney a better asset to a team. If aguero stayed fit always, then yeah, he would be a better player probably. At his best he's world class without a doubt. He's just injured too much so doesn't make as big of an impact as he should over a year. All this is ignoring all the defensive work rooney puts in which is a huge bonus, which of the top strikers in the world, maybe tevez and suarez put in a similar amount, or something close. Nobody else.

1675~~~
When did Rooney before an ironman? Over the previous 3 season Rooney has averaged 40 games in all comps, Aguero averaged 40.67. Seem equally frail to me.

1676~~~
Since aguero came to the premier league, they've played almost the same amount of games but Rooney has played around 1000 minutes more

1677~~~
That's really not that much over 3+ seasons. Rooney's played 4 more PL games, over the same time period, then Aguero. That's up to 360 minutes right there. The rest was probably had a lot to do with City being comfortably ahead in games and taking Aguero at the 70 minute mark.

1678~~~
So, what's the issue if Rooney is slighty behind arguably the best Premier League striker then?

1679~~~
No issue at all apart from that some just can't admit he is behind.

1680~~~
That's funny, because I would say the issue is people who seem to think Rooney is poor. And yet here he is keeping pace with the much vaunted Aguero.

1681~~~
Yup. The issue is people don't consider Rooney to be in that top bracket. Of course, he isn't number one, but he's certainly up there to contend with those considered.

1682~~~
Hardly anyone has said he is poor.

1683~~~
Well we are obviously not the only ones debating Aguero vs Rooney, so here some more stats for those interested:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2014/10/08/wayne-rooney-v-sergio-aguero-who-has-the-better-record-over-the/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2014...io-aguero-who-has-the-better-record-over-the/</a>

1684~~~
After every poor game, you always get posters claiming that he's a poor player and finished. It's actually a very common theme. In reality he's still a fantastic player that most won't appreciate until he really is finished as an attacking threat, which by that time he'll probably move into a deep midfield role and start dictating games.

1685~~~
Aguero is definitely better than Rooney (more so than those stats suggest) but people shouldn't be surprised at how good Rooney's stats are generally. He's a very good player who has spent years playing for a very good team.

The real problem with Rooney is that we have even better strikers than him in RvP and Falcao and a better #10 than him in Mata. That problem is greatly reduced by the formation we're playing though, where Rooney actually fits in quite well.

He's been good so far this season (even in that #10 role) and deserves his place in a very talented front line so I really don't get why some people are still criticising him so much.

1686~~~
Ignoring pens is fair enough. Disregarding free-kicks is just daft. Obviously a benefit to the team having someone capable of scoring from free-kicks and those goals are just as valuable as goals from open play. 

Anyway, there's not much in there we haven't covered. Aguero's goals per minute much better but you get more minutes out of Rooney, more goals overall and significantly more assists. Obviously we're ignoring their influence in terms of number of touches or defensive effort too.

You could spend all day arguing about who has been more valuable to their team over that period of time (and I think it would be absurd to ignore the relative quality of the players creating goals for them) but it's crystal clear that there's not much between them and they're both top class strikers. 

I wonder how many polls pop up on Bluemoon asking if Aguero getting injured is good news for the team? (With a decent chunk of people answering "yes") The amount of utter nonsense talked about Rooney on here is astonishing. Which those stats nicely illustrate.

1687~~~
This is definitely up for debate.

1688~~~
Not based on the last year. If not longer.

Also remain to be convinced that Mata's a better #10. In theory, maybe but hasn't really shown it for United.

Agree with the last para of your post.

1689~~~
True, if RvP doesn't recapture his first season's form then Rooney is the better player.

As for Mata, I'd suggest that a) we're better balanced with him in the team instead of one of the strikers and b) he's shown better form than RvP regardless. So it doesn't really matter if he has/hasn't been a better #10 than Rooney since he arrived as they both deserve to start based on form anyway.

1690~~~
I definitely think it's fair to label Rooney our best striker currently.

1691~~~
Don't really see how Falcao is a better striker than Rooney. Radamel is a brilliant player, but I don't really see what aspects of his game are better compared to Rooney.

1692~~~
I think Falcao is a far more lethal striker than Rooney and can be better at the lone striker role just like Rooney did in 2010.

The thing with Rooney is that he's a strange player, he could be having one of his worst matches and still assist two goals and score one more. That's why a lot of people hate him and complain about his performances but when you look at his stats and the way he constantly give us three points you can't really complain.

1693~~~
Sign of great players, in my opinion. Messi did that throughout the whole world cup.

1694~~~
I'd say even if he does recapture that form, they're both pretty much as good as each other as strikers. I always find it weird how people just claim 'Rooney's not as good as van Persie up front, and not as good as Mata at no.10'
I'd say Rooney's definitely as good as van Persie up top.

No doubts that van Persie has better precision and technique, but I see Rooney as a better finisher, and as less likely to miss a sitter, while van Persie is more likely to score a half chance.
I think Rooney's more adaptable, links up better, plays better with partner(s), and offers more defensively. Given the game-time up top, he'll score a similar number of goals. 

Falcao's only really superior to either in terms of finishing and movement, but I guess one could argue that he's so good at those elements that it makes him a better striker.

1695~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/205/rooneyvaguero_91941.jpg" src="http://cdn3-i.hitc-s.com/205/rooneyvaguero_91941.jpg"/>

1696~~~
Over the same time period, RvP has 40 goals and 12 assists in 65 appearances. That's surprisingly good given his recent indifferent form.

1697~~~
To an extent. If he's playing up top on his own then I think he's more liable to get away with it since his job is to score and be involved in goals. You can argue the same to an extent when he's in behind the striker, although part of why Rooney <i>can </i>be effective there is his overall contribution to the game. It's obviously better to have a player who can play poorly and still grab a goal or assist, but you want them performing well too if possible, especially with someone such as Rooney whose game - when he's on form - is based on more than goals.

And while Messi wasn't anywhere near his very best during the WC, he actually performed fairly well overall. Not Messi-esque usual standards, but he was still good.

1698~~~
He still had a pretty good record last year. Granted, he only scored 12 league goals, but part of that was due to the fact that he played in a lot less games. He still managed to comfortably get a goal every 2 games on average, and he's already grabbed a couple this season despite his fairly lackluster performances.

1699~~~
Just scored 2 goals for England. Closing in on bobby charton record

1700~~~
Scored only one tonight. The other was an OG.

1701~~~
The UEFA will decide in a few days

For example Lampard has scored so many deflected crazy goals and he was the goalscorer instead of an own goal

1702~~~
How was he in the game? Brilliant or outstanding?

1703~~~
He was ok. Should have scored a hat-trick really. Missed two very presentable chances. Of note, he missed both those chances after an excellent first touch (go figure)

1704~~~
Thanks. Going by Qualifiers thread he was "bloody awful".

442 thinks he's just a shade behind MOTM, James Milner.

1705~~~
I'm starting to appreciate this guy more and more now that he's been absent.  Then looking at those comparison stats to Aguero who is widely regarded as one of the best players in the EPL if not the best and it's quite impressive. I think Rooney is a victim of the astronomically high expectations because he's been this prodigy since teenage hood which makes it difficult for him to reach some people's expectations.  But the reality is when you look at his stats, he's going to become a United legend.

1706~~~
The appearances are close but if you look at the minutes played Rooney has played the equivalent of 15 games more.

1707~~~
Yeah, Kun just so rarely finishes games. Not as fine and in shape specimen as our captain.

1708~~~
Rooney's record is pretty decent for a half decent, fat and unfit, overrated, rubbish footballer.

1709~~~
Just scored another against Estonia. So how many goals now required for him to break sir bobby charlton record?

1710~~~
I think 6 more goals to match it.

1711~~~
He really should've scored more tonight. I'm sure a few will carry on about him being a scapegoat etc, but his finishing has been poor.

1712~~~
49 Charlton
48 Lineker
48 Own Goal, Esq
44 Greaves
43 Rooney

You can do it!

1713~~~
His finishing has been unusually poor during the international break.

Some complacency in there I think, which isn't nice to see. He'd be smashing those chances in at club level.

1714~~~
Typical Rooney tonight - an absolutely awful footballing display yet the record books show a goal or assist more often than not.

1715~~~
Yeah, the overall inconsistent/unconvincing touch isn't unusual, but his finishing is usually much better.

1716~~~
Yep, no exaggeration to say he should have scored at least 5 from the chances he's had in these 2 matches

1717~~~
I just wish he would be more ruthless with these chances he's getting. He's wasting them by trying to be too clever with these chips and little dinks. Either go round the keeper or put some proper power behind a shot. You'd think he'd be making the most of his England appearances while he's out suspended for us.

1718~~~
Unless he has an Owen style fall from grace or a career ending injury, he'll undoubtedly break both records (appearances and goals scored)

His finishing over the games has been worrying though, he's looked in good nick for United so far this season, so hopefully this is just the standard crap England performances that always seems to happen to the players.

1719~~~
An aggressively poor performance, but still the match winner.

1720~~~
99 England appearances already. Amazing.

1721~~~
Surprising that his finishing has been poor. He's very clinical for United.

1722~~~
Wasn't as bad as some are making out (although I guess I would say that).

Only really missed one good chance, and that was the 1v1 at the end. The others were by no means easy. And it was no coincidence that chances were falling to Rooney, because he was getting in behind Estonia by making good, intelligent runs - a facet of his game often ignored.

Then he scores the winner (as he so often does for England) with a well taken free kick.

Will still get absolute pelters though, because he's Wayne Rooney, and for some people it's *never* good enough.

1723~~~
You would expect a player of his standing, to at least make the keeper work in one of those chances.

1724~~~
The 'keeper saved the 1vs1.

By no means saying it was one of his better nights, but the criticism will be vastly disproportionate compared to the level of the display - again bearing in mind that he *did* score the winner.

Not Lallana, or Sterling, or Welbz, or Wilshere, or Oxlade-Chamberlain.

Rooney.

1725~~~
I wasn't referring to that one which you had acknowledged but the other two. For a player of Rooney's ability they were disappointing finishes. The reason Rooney draws so much criticism is because he is generally acknowledged as England's best player therefore there are greater expectations laid on him. None of those other players you mentioned have been regarded as world class unlike Rooney, who for years, has been billed as one of the best players in the world. Whether that's fair, I'm not sure, but it is only natural for people to look at their captain and 'talisman' for inspiration.

1726~~~
And tonight he scored the winning goal with a great free kick.

1727~~~
Only 12 of Rooney's goals have come in friendlies as compared to 32 for Sir Bobby. That's an amazing stat!

1728~~~
Seconded. Admittedly his finishing was poor today, but in terms of all round game was far better than other players in an England shirt. Least he looked bothered and hungry, even though the goals never came. Got the winner, which is the best thing to come out of the game. If that first half volley that narrowly went over the bar had hit the back of the net I doubt Wazza would be getting called so poor. Laughable hearing some say he was the worst player for England.

1729~~~
And missed three other decent chances...

1730~~~
1 on 1 is the weakest part of Rooney's finishing. He hasn't had many 1 on 1s for a long time compared to other strikers. The last two games have reminded me of his 07-08 finishing when through on goal and he overthinks.

Every other part of finishing he's very reliable like the goals he's scored this season.

1731~~~
Rooney's in the unenviable position of being 'acknowledged' as England's best player (and one of United's best players) - and expected to deliver accordingly, while also being seen, by many, as overrated and not that good.
And it's often the same people, using either viewpoint whenever it suits them.

Anyone would think Rooney created his own hype, held a gun to the chief executive's head, and bigged himself up in interviews before each game.

1732~~~
Rooney's finishing has always been better when he hasn't had to think about it to much, and just acted on instinct. When he has loads of time he tends to overdo it and make it far more complicated then it needs to be.

1733~~~
To be fair, he's hardly helped himself in that regard with his previous threats to leave.

1734~~~
Am I imagining it, or did Rooney go through a phase where he regularly attempted chips, even though a simple shot and finish would've made more sense? I'm not sure if I'm remembering correctly, but it'd apply to your point if I am.

1735~~~
It is, but then when games against absolute chimps like San Marino count as competitive games it's a tricky comparison to make!

How did he not score that 90th min chance. Farks sake, he could have easily gone past Greaves with the 2 games chances, and been within touching distance of Lineker and Charlton!

1736~~~
26 off matching Shilton!

Although it looked like Owen would definitely become all time top scorer when he hit goal 40 at 28 (I think), appearances are a different story.

Just needs to stay fit for a couple of seasons, and he's super close.

1737~~~
I can't wait until he's gone from this club and retired from the England team, so we can finally move on from him and this overdue 'Rooney issue' can finally be over..

Hopefully he will break his precious records by the time Euro 2016 is over, so we can can go in to the next World Cup campaign without this strangle hold he's had on the national team for the last decade.

With a bit of luck, he'll also break the United goal record within the same time, so he can then also leave United for a 'new challenge' and we can free ourselves too..fingers crossed!

1738~~~
Wow. If that's not sarcastic <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1739~~~
Fecking hell. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I hope this is sarcasm.

1740~~~
I meant every word of it.

1741~~~
San Marino weren't around in them days.

1742~~~
With the chances Rooney had against both, San Marino and Estonia, he should already be England's all time top goalscorer, but I have full confidence he will eventually overtake Sir Bobby Charlton.

1743~~~
I might be one of the few that thinks the England team would look a lot more cohesive without Rooney.

1744~~~
Still it does take a little edge off those who like to quickly point out players like Rooney only have the goals he does because of friendlies and easy games, they seem to forget it wasn't all that different in Bobs time.

1745~~~
Surely if a player is the top scorer for one of the most successful sides in England <i>and </i>a relatively big national team, he's not the sort of player who you'd automatically want out of your team? I do think some of his stats flatter him a little bit, but he's not just held in high esteem by club and country for no reason whatsoever, no matter how frustrating he can sometimes be.

1746~~~
Anyone who does that is being a bit silly. There were more goals scored in those days too. Still, one was a midfielder and one wasn't so comparing the two isn't comparing like for like anyway even if you ignore the different eras. Owen would be a fairer comparison.

1747~~~
True, just proves that comparing different eras is almost an impossibility.

1748~~~
Don't think that's right...

Bobby Charlton
- 22 goals in friendlies (2 v Sweden, 3 v Portugal, 3 v Switzerland, 3 v Mexico, 4 v USA, 1 v Italy, Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, East-Germany, Yugoslavia, Austria and Colombia)
- 16 goals in the British Home Championship (5 v Scotland, 6 v N.Ireland, 5 v Wales)
- 5 in WC qualifiers (all 5 v Luxembourg)
- 1 in EC qualifiers (v Spain)
- 1 in the EC (v Soviet Union)
- 4 in the WC (2 v Portugal, 1 v Mexico, 1 v Argentina)

1749~~~
I admit that what I wrote in my above post was a massive rant, but this hold that Rooney has over the game in this country is something that's been playing on my mind for quite a while now.

It's actually seriously getting on my tits, how everyone in the press is talking about how special it is, that he's getting closer to breaking the international goal record.

Like it actually feckin matters! It still wont change the fact that he's been rubbish at every single tournament since Euro 2004.

And now that he's been made Captain makes my piss boil even more, because it now means he's become pretty much undroppable for at least the next few years.

Cheers Woy!

1750~~~
Well the entire team has been rubbish in these tournaments and well Rooney did go into two of those tournaments still recovering from major injury.

1751~~~
No, you are right he is the black sheep in this England team, without him Hodgson will be able to create an all-average team.

1752~~~
Those players didn't have a hold on the English game the way that Rooney has. Not even Lampard and Gerrard received the amount of favouritism that he has over the years.

And in response to how you made the excuse that he was injured; then why did they keep picking him? Why is he the only player who has become virtually undroppable even when he's playing shit?

The only tournament that he went in to with a major injury was World Cup 2006 (metatarsal). And we all know what happened; he got himself sent off in the Quarter Finals for stamping on Carvalho and effectively lost us the game.

Then in our last qualifier before Euro 2012, he again kicked another player against Montenegro, got himself sent off and was suspended for the first two games of the tournament.

Like I said, NO PLAYER has been given the amount of leeway that Rooney has. And it's not as if we would of done any worse without him. He's flattered to deceive at every tournament since Euro 2004.

1753~~~
Write a letter to both Roy and Van Gaal and share your opinion with them, perhaps they will finally see Rooney for what he is, but it won't happen without your help so hurry!

1754~~~
Not that I gave a feck about England..Rooney won the game for them tonight, what on earth are you ranting on about?

1755~~~
I'm ranting on about the fact how Rooney has become undroppable for both club and country. 

Rooney was absolutely woeful again tonight - not only did he miss loads of piss easy chances, but his overall play was his usual lethargic and sloppy; he must have lost possession more than any other player, combined with his predictable first-touch of a rapist.

But as usual, he scores from a free-kick of which the goalkeeper should of saved, and so any criticism towards him now becomes void..

1756~~~
Still won the game!

1757~~~
Yeah, against Estonia..

1758~~~
...so drop all the other players too or just Rooney?

1759~~~
I don't really care if England keeps Rooney as their main man, they will not win anything either way.
My concern is his role in Utd and that has been more or less settled by LVG. Rooney may be the captain for the time being but for sure he is no longer our main man. He is not even our main striker. So even though I share most of your views, at least when it comes to Utd I don't think you have to worry too much.

1760~~~
Why do England fans bash their players all the time? Rooney is probably one of the few genuine quality players they have but they're so caught up in talking shite about him.

1761~~~
Good players tend to be undroppable.

1762~~~
dont usually watch England qualifiers....we seem to get  into the tournament and than as usual find a way to get out ASAP.
wont rant on about the management.. have done that often enough.

As for Rooney...he is close to beating Greaves and Charlton's goals records.

He has been excellent for United so far this season. Dont see what the problem is. We will miss him in the next two matches.

1763~~~
4 of Rooney's 43 goals for England were against San Marino since people were wondering.

1764~~~
He was really really bad tonight but the goal records speak for themselves. Can be a frustrating player.

1765~~~
Wow, not far off 10%.

1766~~~
So from what I can gather he was no good but still scored. Typical Rooney game then?

1767~~~
I hope he retires from England duty. I'm always worried the inevitable backlash he gets will feck his form up for us. United players seem to have a really bad time with England for whatever reason.

1768~~~
Poor game or not he's the only who looked like scoring against a poor team like Estonia..none of the other attackers even came close. His finishing was a bit iffy but apart from that he was okay. 

If Rooney retires from England duty then there's literally no one to replace him now. People can harp on about Sturridge, Welbeck etc but both of them doesn't have the class of Rooney nor they have the record.

1769~~~
From what I've seen everybody on the pitch from English side was shit. Midfielders, attackers, whatever, everybody was rubbish there, defenders didn't have too much to do. Not to mention that England were playing with an advantage since 50th minute or so and they still couldn't break Estonia.

Pretty rich to single Rooney out when nobody else was making a chance for themselves and in the end, it was him who gave them 3 points from a free-kick because they didn't look like scoring from an open play. If somebody wondered if trio of Wilshit-Delph and Henderson would work, well, it didn't. Certainly not under Woy.

1770~~~
It isn't rich at all to single him out in a thread which is titled "Wayne Rooney's performances". Does he get a pass when the rest of the team he plays with don't perform? If so, the thread title should be changed don't you think? 

Fact is Rooney as captain should be the inspiring leader such a team needs and he isn't. Added to that despite winning us the game with a decent free kick that better keepers would have kept out, his overall play was again inept. The chance he missed was, well, a sitter really. That a player held up to be one of the world's best produced such a poor finish nets him, rightly so, criticism of his performance.

1771~~~
Of course it's right to criticise him after yesterday's performance because there was much to be desired but it's not even about this thread itself. In the Euro Qualifires he was getting a lot of shit from people as well when it was clearly visible that the <b>whole</b> team was struggling, yet he was quite often singled out.

I suppose that we'll both agree that Rooney is not captain's material but what should he do? Resign from captaincy? Would show even bigger lack of bollocks. For some reason both LVG and Woy see a 'leader' in him but we both know that he probably won't be too inspiring to his team mates, thus I don't really expect it from him. I don't really know who claims he's 'one of the world's best' too to be fair.

It does look like some people who are watching English NT are in for a shocker. Many thought that if you drop shits like Gerrard and other slow, static players this team would turn into God knows what. In the end, they've played with probably the most energetic, running and engine-esque midfield they're able to field and still looked awful. Even the 'best young player in the world bla bla bla' didn't do anything that was extraordinary.

1772~~~
As always the criticism in this thread full of moronic hyperbole.

He definitely should have scored at least once from open play. Same as the San Marino game. Guilty of some really poor finishing in both games. Overall performance was nowhere near as bad as you'd think reading some of the comments above. Wasn't great but wasn't terrible either. 

The reason he got so many good chances was because of really well timed runs, for which he deserves some credit. Him and Wilshere look to have a really good understanding. Be nice to see something similar develop at United. My money's on Hererra dinking those passes over the top. Needs to be a lot more fecking clinical when he's clean through though. Which we all know he's capable of.

1773~~~
Rooney besides the goal was poor - he seems to be a shadow of his best at the moment.

1774~~~
Not really his style of passing, is it? Far more likely to see Scholes-esque from Di Maria, even Blind maybe.

1775~~~
Yeah I agree with all that.......I said it before somewhere, but I think Rooney is considered world class in England because we really do have a dearth of top players able to play a game of football (which is as much mental as physical) in the way I feel more Europeans are able to (not all by any means). We are definitely behind technically and until a football revolution happens in our country, starting at grass roots level (aged 6 and up, much like what happened in Belgium over the past 10 years or so) we will be holding up players like Rooney as the example to all.

1776~~~
Exactly this. Not a brilliant performance by any means, but not half as bad as some posts would try to make out. A lot of England's chances went through him and he did look like the only one that could score. His movement was very good, it's his finishing that let him down though the only really disappointing one for me was the one right at the end that he definitely should've buried.

1777~~~
The Rooney bashing is getting tiresome now, I tend to ignore it. 
I actually thought he played well last night, yes, his finishing could have been better but he still got the winning goal. He seems to be the easy or should I say lazy target for fans who probably didn't even watch the game, if they did then they clearly have an agenda and would most likely criticise no matter how well he played.
The media know having a go at Rooney will sell papers, they are by far the biggest negative influence on their national team.

1778~~~
I think Welbeck has a lot of potential and will do well at Arsenal but Rooney's performance was better than his by a country mile.

Obviously, expectations are higher but that doesn't mean we can't judge each performance on it's own merits. Especially on a night where the mighty Diego Costa took almost exactly the same amount of time to score against fecking Luxembourg!

1779~~~
which is impressive in itself seeing as Brazil weren't even playing them.

1780~~~
Indeed!

1781~~~
I don't really care about the other England players though. I wasn't intentionally singling him out either. My comment wasn't intended to be a harsh criticism as such, it was more a general comment of how I see Rooney performing these days.

1782~~~
8 competitive starts this season. 5 goals, 2 assists.

Imagine the numbers he'd be able to produce if he wasn't so consistently 'rotten'.

1783~~~
Rooney struggled last night because England were piss poor. The same as they were piss poor against San Marino. I thought Rooney was Englands best player against San Marino, and was desperately unlucky. He could easily have bagged himself 4 or 5 goals. It seems the goalkeeper only made a save when Rooney had a shot or tried a chip. It's not fair to single Rooney out when the whole team was so dire last night. To be fair a typical England performance.

1784~~~
3 assists. One for own goal from San Marino player. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

And it would be an amazing assist to Henderson if Liverpool player didn't screwed it up.

1785~~~
Wonder how will people view him when he breaks both the club and international goal record. He not far from it now.

1786~~~
Excellent? He really hasn't been excellent for us this season yet.

1787~~~
The negative spin has already started:

<i>"But..but .. but...
He should have broken the United Record years ago. Ronaldo would have broken it years ago.
And, he scores most of his goals against San Marino in qualifiers, and does nothing when it matters. Plus penalties."</i>

1788~~~
10-20 years later, he will be hailed much higher than he is now.

Imagine by May 2015, he is Uniteds and Englands all time top scorer. And was one of the reasons United clinch the title from Chelsea. I would still have a thing against him, and I cant explain why.

1789~~~
His record and his reputation will always supercede his talent for me. Even posters on here get confused now mixing those up.
He's surely one of the most boring in the so called top bracket of players? And unlikeable too to boot...

I wonder whether he'd be a more exciting player had he stayed at Everton longer and not lost the raw energy he once had

1790~~~
Explosions!

1791~~~
Costa misses chances for Spain - "You would be worried if he wasn't getting chances but he is so the goals will come."

Rooney misses chances for England - "He is overrated and shite."

1792~~~
he will also break Shilton's appearence record.

He is simply among the greatest footballers England have produced.

1793~~~
Fantastic article on Rooney:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.setanta.com/ie/rooney-whose-potential-hasnt-he-fulfilled/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.setanta.com/ie/rooney-whose-potential-hasnt-he-fulfilled/</a>

<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Rooney – Whose potential hasn’t he fulfilled?</b></span>

<b>International football is a strange romping ground for the elite footballers in the world. Over the weekend, Neymar and Lionel Messi went head to head with the former having quietly accumulated a number of goals in Brazil shirts which will see him start to be compared to the greats, and the latter still suffering from a World Cup Final heartache where another universe had him finally holding the trophy which put him on a par with Diego Maradona.</b>

It’s not quite a universe away but in Estonia on Sunday, Wayne Rooney was once again subjected to comments about his contribution despite his goal being the match winner.

How fair is it? Well, let’s examine the story so far for Rooney. He was loved by all in the English game when he broke through at Everton and made such waves in Euro 2004. Ten years later, some contend that he isn’t even the best centre forward England have, and opinion on him is split among Manchester United supporters too, many of whom have yet to forgive him for his terrible autumn of 2010.

The talk about Rooney, and his ability and potential, is natural. After all, he is edging towards two goalscoring records, both held by Sir Bobby Charlton. Breaking either will elevate him to undeniable legend status if only by virtue of the record and that inevitability sticks in the craw of many. Why? Because those people find Rooney unlikeable.

Unlikeable, for rival fans, because he plays for Manchester United and is prone to moments of madness. The player anyone would hate if they’re on your opponents team. Unlikeable for United fans because of what went on in 2010.

It’s probably fair to look back at that time and consider what went on. He was the subject of tabloid allegations about his private life and was subsequently dropped for a potentially hostile trip to Everton. Prior to this, he had finally proven his own worth, stepping out of Cristiano Ronaldo’s shadow to score 34 goals in 44 games in the 2009/10 season.

Then came the September 2010 allegations which threatened his marriage. A face-off with Sir Alex Ferguson followed where the pair appeared to publicly disagree about the player’s condition to partake on international duty. Rooney was subsequently dropped and used as a substitute for United’s following game against West Brom. Then, it was leaked that Rooney had asked for a transfer away from United at the start of a week which ended with him signing a five year contract.

His crime to United supporters wasn’t the supposed infidelity (after all, it would be a small ‘holier than thou’ section of society able to castigate him on these grounds), it was the transfer request, with Manchester City the supposed suitors. All sorts were rumoured, suggestions of a deal already having been agreed with the blues and Rooney’s agent Paul Stretford. How could he? How could he even entertain the notion? Well, what top player wouldn’t throw the toys out of the pram if they have been dropped?

After more minutes and games being played out of position in the 2012/13 season, rumours of another bust up with Ferguson led to mixed stories of another transfer request. United supporters were still appalled at Rooney yet this time he was more obviously dispensable. If he could be moved on for a transfer fee before breaking the club’s goalscoring record, then all the better. It’s even said – not even half jokingly – amongst some that one of David Moyes’ biggest errors as United manager was to give Rooney another five year contract. The decision of Louis van Gaal to make him captain was not a universally popular or indeed, welcome, one.

That discontent with Rooney’s position as the spearhead of United’s attack sits a little more comfortably now supporters can logically question his ability. ‘His first touch is awful’, ‘He hasn’t bossed a game for about four years’ are among the comments which at times seem more like overdue, welcome opportunities to twist the knife.

Another slight used to denigrate Rooney is the notion that he hasn’t fulfilled his potential. This is a fascinating debate. Soon after his arrival at United, a chant was invented for him describing him as the ‘White Pele’. Probably assisted by the fact he shared a dressing room with Cristiano Ronaldo, from the moment he went to Old Trafford, he was compared to Ronaldo and Messi. In recent months, pundits like Stan Collymore have repeated the comparison. It shouldn’t be an insult when Ronaldo and Messi are not only the two best in the world, they are vying to be the best ever, but when aimed at Rooney, it appears to be used as one. Collymore described Rooney as ‘an experienced grinder’ and said the player once compared to Messi and Ronaldo ‘no longer exists at international level’.

Wayne Rooney, it seems, is supposed to be all things to all people. A fiery performance in Belfast in 2005 for England provoked column inches saying Rooney needed to grow up. He was sent off a week later for United against Villareal for sarcastically applauding the referee. In 2006 he was infamously dismissed for a World Cup stamp on Ricardo Carvalho. If he didn’t mature his game, he would not last long at the highest level, he was told. Those moments of madness became more infrequent (though still exist, as his recent red card against West Ham indicates, although all parties insist that was more a tactical aberration), leading to concerns that the fire that once made him what he was had gone, and so was the player he ‘should have’ become. Once praised for his selflessness throughout the 2006-2009 period which saw him often played wide, that spell is now one provided as an example of the period where his decline as a footballer started.

People look at the goal he scored against Newcastle in 2005 and say those magic moments are few and far between. Shouldn’t they be, by definition? When it comes to Rooney, no. His amazing goal against Manchester City in 2011 and his half-way line effort against West Ham earlier this year are almost casually dismissed because of the perception he should have done it more often. Read that sentence back and then try to decide whether it is fair.

His goal ratio is roughly 1 in 2. Over his career, aside from a couple of highs which buck that trend in 2010 and 2012, that ratio has been his dependable average. He should score more often, he should have more of an influence on games, all these things are levelled against Rooney to the extent that what he does is dismissed against the ideal of what people think he should do.

The criticism for his performance against Estonia taken into isolation was fair. Goal aside, he was poor. Jack Wilshere was arguably the best of a pretty band bunch because England ought to have won the game fairly convincingly. And yet it was Rooney, not Wilshere, who made the difference, with his 43rd international goal in 99 appearances. As soon as the ball was in the net, it was ‘about time’. Only Paul Gascoigne, in recent generations, could be said to have been subjected to such scrutiny.

When you take everything into consideration, you have to look at the base of the problem – the level of hype and projected potential in the first place. Who was responsible for projecting that potential? It wasn’t Rooney. So why is he being held responsible for not being Messi or Ronaldo? Whose potential is he actually being expected to fulfill here?

His international goal record isn’t too dissimilar to that of Alan Shearer. Shearer wasn’t expected to do anything but score goals and was lauded for that fact. Rooney is expected to provide more – but for the main, that goal record has come without being the primary taker of free kicks or penalties as the likes of Beckham, Gerrard and Lampard asserted their own seniority. It’s almost as if Rooney is expected to not only score, but provide the assist.

At the current average (and Rooney’s is always stable) you can project that he will be breaking the record around this time next year or early 2016. In fact, 2015/16 should be the year that both of Charlton’s records become his.

There will be some who will reason that it should have come sooner.mThese are records that were established over an entire career by Charlton, records that Rooney will match, break, and then set new ones.nThe truth, though, is that Rooney will not be revered in the same manner as the man whose records he will surpass.

Sure, there will be a time when the records are imminently within his grasp where the achievements will be acknowledged and hyped up. The response will be predictable from those who won’t be happy. And – sooner rather than later – the tired comparisons to the likes of Ronaldo and Messi will be trotted out.

The great unanswered question for those who level those comments will be, ‘How good did you expect Rooney to be?’ To become Manchester United’s and England’s record goalscorer – what exactly were you expecting? More?

1794~~~
That's an excellent article. 100% agree with it.

1795~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://man-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/a2.jpg" src="http://man-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/a2.jpg"/>


That bald patch when he was young.

1796~~~
He bangs in the goals in the qualifiers but doesn't deliver anything in International tournaments. Breaking the record wont mean as much with no meaningful goals. A solitary goal against Uruguay is all he managed this year, and it's not enough for England's supposed best player.

1797~~~
That's still 50% of all "meaningful" England goals this year.

1798~~~
Surely goals in qualifying matches are meaningful?

I saw this in a different article:

1799~~~
Good article. I don't like Rooney but a lot on here are way too harsh on him because of their dislike.

1800~~~
He scored 4 I think before the injury in the European championships (his first one) and had injuries going into the other tournaments. I think it looks worse then it actually is.

1801~~~
The qualifiers are a piece of piss for the top seeds.

1802~~~
Yeah, we saw that against Estonia.

Germans and Dutch also might see it differently.

1803~~~
In recent years they have been. Playing San Marino and Estonia to qualify for an international tournament is a piece of piss. Comparing Spain and Germany after their recent successes is silly. They'll both qualify easily in the end. Only Holland seem to be struggling but their team looks pretty poor just now. Look at the South American World Cup qualifying. That's actually exciting with all the top teams facing off twice.

1804~~~
If Rooney scored in qualifiers which had the teams the level of the South American one, I'm sure there would be a lot of people ready to discredit that too so he can't win really.

1805~~~
And the one South American team he played against this year in a competitive match, he scored. And was rather unlucky not to have scored more than once.

1806~~~
My point was that 3 world cups later and a euros and he's done nothing. Ten years since he made an impact at the international stage

1807~~~
He's not playing alone.

1808~~~
Two of those tournaments he went into having just recovered from a broken ankle and with zero match fitness. Hardly too surprising.

1809~~~
Judging by United fans on here and on Twitter, you'd think Rooney single handedly takes on opponents at both club and country level.

1810~~~
He's meant to be England's best player.

1811~~~
Even best players don't play alone. Even Ronaldo looks rubbish at the international stage.

1812~~~
No, I'd expect England's best player to do more when it counts, rather than disappoint on the international stage for a decade.

1813~~~
England have a better team than Portugal, who haven't had a striker worth note since Pauleta.

1814~~~
Let's face it Rooney fans.He as peaked. Only down hill from there.

1815~~~
Wasn't it a poor miss rather than him being unlucky? Can't really remember it properly so could be wrong.

1816~~~
Goodbye, sweet prince. I'll miss your explosions. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>


Yet, they do so little as well.

1817~~~
To wr8 it was unlucky, to the objective fan it was a poor miss.

1818~~~
Crap keeper, average defence, no midfield and Ronaldo. What a team

1819~~~
Extremely tough header. Was there something more?

1820~~~
No, sorry, I meant, England is a better squad than Portugal, yet still they do so little as well.

1821~~~
Oh, apologies. Yeah England should be doing better. There's no doubt about it. Rooney should be pushing them on in these tournaments but he's often been one of the worse players in the team.

1822~~~
Rooney has been a huge disappointment for England. Anyone who believes the contrary needs their brain seen too. Scoring against San Marino and Estonia doesn't change that.

1823~~~
Despite Rooney not replicating the type of good performances for England he does for United, surely a player who's close to being all time top goalscorer can't be seen as 'a huge disappointment for England'. As a big England fan, of course I'd like to see Rooney performing better, but at the end of the day, goals win you games, and if those goals help England to qualify, despite it being an 'easy' group, I'll be more than happy.

1824~~~
True. Same for van Persie. But I think Rooney will offer more for longer.

1825~~~
I think Rooney would perform better if he wasn't expected to run the whole team, like he does for both club and country.  He is being utilized like a playmaker forward, someone who drops back to win possession, as well as try to both create and score.  When he's on form, he's fantastic.  But far too often he is not, and the entire team suffers as a result.  Since he is approaching this thirties, instead of building a team around him, managers should perhaps give him a more specialized role and share responsibility with the rest of the team, instead of having everything go through him as the main outlet for any creativity.

1826~~~
Was reading a stat somewhere. Only 3 players have more goals+assists than Rooney in the last decade. They're Messi, Ronaldo and Zlatan.

1827~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/CXGXy1Z.jpg?1" src="http://i.imgur.com/CXGXy1Z.jpg?1"/> 

Opta counts assists a bit different than me and transfermarkt. I have him on 97 in PL, tm on 94.

1828~~~
Tbf to Rooney, Zlatan's playing in a really shite league and taking the piss with the defences over there.

1829~~~
To be fair to Zlatan, he was already doing that before he moved to Ligue 1. He scored 28 league goals the year before he moved to PSG, so he's more than capable of doing it in a top league and probably still would be.

Very impressive from Rooney though, wouldn't have expected him to be so high.

1830~~~
The fact that a 37 year old unfancied striker like Di Natale has very similar numbers to Rooney would suggest that the stat is slightly misleading.

1831~~~
Before his move to PSG he only hit >20 league goals twice in his career. Both of it in the Serie A, which is arguably a weaker league than the PL. Rooney had two seasons as well, but Zlatan scored nearly twice the amount of league goals since he signed for PSG. I really doubt he can replicate that kind of goalscoring form in a better league.

1832~~~
Di Natale's a superb goalscorer though, has been for a number of years.

1833~~~
I don't understand, it's a good thing to have better numbers than a player who is 8 years older, even more when it's a very good player.

1834~~~
Di Natale had four 20+ goals seasons in a row in Serie A. And that's last four seasons. Dude's good no matter how old he is.

1835~~~
Goals + assists over last 10 years visualized:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://img.kalooga.com/thumb?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FB0H6cbTCEAAEp98.jpg&amp;md5val=c2dc41a0cecbb11ffbaf88c2b0cbf8f1&amp;key=2fbeb4cb2437cb721b593e448ffbc05fbde142db&amp;method=fit&amp;size=1680x960" src="http://img.kalooga.com/thumb?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FB0H6cbTCEAAEp98.jpg&amp;md5val=c2dc41a0cecbb11ffbaf88c2b0cbf8f1&amp;key=2fbeb4cb2437cb721b593e448ffbc05fbde142db&amp;method=fit&amp;size=1680x960"/>

1836~~~
This.

1837~~~
Di Natale was a quality goalscorer.

1838~~~
..or it suggests that Di Natale was actually very good, bit under appreciated and a player who to his credit stuck with a team which wasn't great.

1839~~~
Rooney is a fantastic number 9, but not quite world class anywhere else. His quality in the box/finishing vs the rest of his game isn't quite at the extreme ratio of a Chicharito, Pippo Inzaghi or Darren Bent, but it's not a million miles off. His effort levels, vision and long passing separate him from those guys, but he's at their level as a finisher. 

He's just miscast in his current role. I honestly think he'd score 10 more a season than Benzema gets at Real as the 9. If Falcao doesn't stay, we should be ecstatic to have Rooney as our main 9 going forward, with Van Persie pushing him in the short-term and hopefully Wilson in the long-term. 

We really need a hashtag or something that says NoNewCentralAttackers. It's already claimed the United careers of Kagawa, Welbeck and Chicharito. Really a shame we didn't buy Hazard when we were seemingly in for him. 

More likely, this will be the plan going forward:

------------Falcao/Rooney-------
----------Rooney/Mata---Januzaj
---DiMaria-------Herrera--------
-------------Blind-----------------

which looks reasonably balanced. We really need Januzaj to develop into a star or we need to buy a wide attacker with pace and production like Reus.

1840~~~
Is Wayne back for the Chelsea game?

1841~~~
No

1842~~~
Feels like he's been out for ages.

1843~~~
..because we seem half the team without him. Though they are very different players, Rooney is as important to the team as Roy Keane was....

1844~~~
Rooney's a necessity.

1845~~~
We need Rooney back ASAP.

1846~~~
It's pretty obvious we miss him. He may not have the technical ability as Mata but he gives us drive and passion; a presence on the pitch. He would have been handy for the WBA game.

1847~~~
Christ, the stick he gets when he plays, and how people miss him when absent, he really is one of the most divided figures in world football. Foreign players rave about him, yet we call him bellow top quality. Rival teams downplay him, but would absolutely kill to have him starting for them. Chelsea would have smashed the league last year if we sold him to them.

1848~~~
When the other team sits back and defends like West Brom did, Rooney becomes a decent 10, in that he's an incredible goal threat from that position, and it's tough to get a 10 on the ball against a packed D anyways, or at least Mata can't seem to do it.

1849~~~
The game seemed to be calling out for a player like him to come on for mata or Van persie. Someone who looks to get involved and a driving force if you will to get us that but extra to get a goal. I was hoping mata or Van persie would step up a bit in his absence but they've both been shite, so it shows how much we need him.

1850~~~
Our problems have little to do with Rooney's presence or absence. He played against Burnley, Sunderland and Leicester and we still failed to win. This much will become clear when he returns. Neither Rooney nor the other forwards have been world class over the last 18 months. The situation with our forwards is a bit like the situation with our defenders from 2-3 seasons ago. Their reputation is way bigger than their current ability.

1851~~~
He doesn't need to do great to be a much better option than Rvp or Mata right now. And he's been having a very good season for us and contributes in terms of goals, assists as well as some work rate upfront and presence which neither RvP or Mata provide.

1852~~~
Considering how van Persie and Mata are playing even Chicharito would be helpful.

1853~~~
Yeah but his link up isn't as good as Mata, lads!

1854~~~
We'll be a much better team going forwards with Rooney in the team than we are without him. Always been that way and is no different this season. As soon as Di Maria started playing we've produced spells of sensational attacking football (albeit not for 90 minutes yet). That's been notable by it's absence in our last two games.  No great surprise but frustrating all the same.

1855~~~
And the pendulum swings into the other direction...

1856~~~
Rooney has always been undervalued in this forum, people were saying how Mata is a better no.10 well that theory has been proven wrong. I'm not saying Rooney would have won us the game yesterday but would have offered a lot more than Mata did going forward as well in defence.

1857~~~

1858~~~
He's the only football players birthday I know because its the same as mine, might ring him after to go for a few drinks because he's no match this weekend <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1859~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Happy birthday mate

1860~~~
They'd better make him a fecking cake...

1862~~~
Wish him to avoid any serious injuries and mental toughness in the more difficult moments.

1863~~~
You have to be truly blind not to see the importance of this player in the team. He has always been important for us, since 2005.

1864~~~
He's back and no one took their chance to replace him. Hoping he will be fired up and ready.

1865~~~
Agreed.

1866~~~
Apparently he's injured.

1867~~~
What do out players do in training <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1868~~~

1869~~~
Oh for the love of feck.

1870~~~
FFS. This is getting ridiculous.

1871~~~
The feck? What is it with people posting random rumours without any source? Seems to be constantly happening these days.

1872~~~
Seems to be coming from Alex someone or other at ESPN,  according to tweets in the match thread.

1873~~~
Is this injury legit?  There is so much random BS popping up in every thread, it's hard to know.

1874~~~

1875~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> so he gets injured as soon as he's available ffs

1876~~~
Hot, cold and boiling from the same tap?!

1877~~~
Nothing on the Torygraph website and no tweets from their journos that I can see. 

Anyhoo, having argued that we're clearly a better team with him playing (and I stand by that) we're arguably better able to cope without him than we ever have in his United career before. So no need to panic.

1878~~~
Really hope it's some mind-games bullshit.

1879~~~
That front page is definitely real as @suttonnick has tweeted it

1880~~~

1881~~~
At least Falcao will be back, if Rooney misses out.

Never thought I'd ever say that sentence.

1882~~~
Do we train on a minefield? What the feck is going on?

1883~~~
Ogden says he's a doubt but the official twitter has just tweeted this

1884~~~
How come Rooney never gets labeled as injury prone when he has played less minutes in the 5 seasons than Van Persie

1885~~~
I'm actually looking foward to having him back, we've been doing so well without him as a team except the #10 position (Mata)  so we're gonna be instantly improved.

1886~~~

1887~~~
I get the same impression. No other team suffers with so many players getting injured in the fecking training.

1888~~~
It's a serious concern. It's been happening for years on end, how have we not found some form of rectification?

1889~~~
I will admit that I have been critical of Rooney in the past but I am beginning to see his importance to United. I think the way forward in modern football is one up front which is where our dilema comes in. It has always been the United way to have an abundance of riches up front. We can't really get away with playing one up top unless we have injuries or suspensions like the Chelsea game at the weekend.

1890~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Probably

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1891~~~
Beyond ridiculous our injury problems.

Carrington needs a serious looking at.

Anyway, that should definitely see Rooney out of the game.

We saw last year (and we've seen countless times in the past) what he plays like if he's got a slight niggle despite claiming he's fully fit. fecking useless.

1892~~~
Get fecked, get absolutely fecked.

This is getting out of hand now...

1893~~~
this is getting absolutely ridiculous. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1897~~~
Can someone post what that official twitter said? Can't see it for some reason.

1898~~~
Nonsense. You're just making shit up now. He'll have carried slight niggles into dozens of games each season. That's life as a professional footballer.

If you're talking about the first game after a long term injury (or that one season when we had to play him when clearly unfit after the Bayern injury) then that's a different story. But hardly the same situation here.

1899~~~

1900~~~
I never seen that. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Must have been around four years ago.

1901~~~
Farce..

Last year Moyes and his dinosaur methods were blamed, but lots of injuries happened before that and in the last few years it has become ridiculous. 

Obviously its sthing else going on, not the manager's fault, or we're that lucky that our managers have that kind of traninings where players get injured constantly. 

Maybe we should quit training and just play games...

Ffs....

1902~~~
Is this true? Surely not? What are the stats?

1903~~~
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>Minutes played in the league between 2009/10 - 2013/14 inclusive:
</b></span>
Rooney - 12'225
Van Persie - 11'056

So no, it isn't true. Rooney has 1169 minutes more, or roughly 12 games. And Rooney's stats are dented somewhat by the fact Fergie deliberately left him out of his last few games, even though he wasn't injured.

1904~~~
RvP was regularly injured before 2011. What are the stats since the start of 2011? That would be more interesting and revealing.

1905~~~
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Minutes played in the league between 2011/12 - 2013/14 inclusive:</span>
</b>
Rooney - 7289
Van Persie - 8034

So Van Persie has the better record since 2011/12, based on him hardly missing a game during 2011/12 and 2012/13.

1906~~~
Not just the Bayern game. Throughout his time at United whenever he's had any small break from a few matches he's come back and been terrible yet we've played him because 'Wayne just wants to play'.

I'm always critical of him but I actually wanted him back for the derby in spite of this. Now he's picked up a slight knock I don't want him anywhere near the team.

1907~~~
Not that I agree with this anyway (loads of example of him making a big impact in his first game back from injury) but you're not talking about the same scenario. You're talking about him missing a run of games with an injury. This isn't what has happened here. He's (allegedly) got a minor injury which may or may not make him miss a singe game of football.

The first clause in your second last sentence speaks volumes...

1908~~~
Thank you.

1909~~~
Plus Rooney being occasionally dropped by Fergie, as you mention above.

1910~~~
The Daily Heil article linked above, has this to say about the alleged injury.

Anyone who's ever played football knows it's common to be a bit lame immediately after getting a kick during training, then absolutely fine 24-48 hours later. Seems like incredibly scant evidence to get alarmed about and start all the "injury prone" chat again.

1911~~~
Keeps City guessing, anyway.

1912~~~
No Wayne. No party.

1913~~~
5 goals in his last 4 visits to the Etihad. The best of which, for me, was this one:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9x2ZAwdO5l8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1914~~~
An incredible stat. Wonder who the next most prolific visitor is and how many goals they've scored?

"Happy he's out"

1915~~~
Hope he's fit as we've missed him. That said though, if he's half fit then I'd rather he wasn't involved. We've seen it backfire far too many times in the past.

1916~~~
Thanks mate.

1917~~~
That minefields name is Jones.

1918~~~
Weren't there some stories in the summer about Van Gaal wanting to renovate Carrington or am I just making things up?

1919~~~
He wanted to plant trees, it's very windy at Carrington an article said.

1920~~~
Ah yeah. Let's hope the trees increase the oxygen enough to keep our players fit then.

1921~~~
Mind games,  he'll be fit. He's not gonna miss the derby, could always take pain killing injections and rest him against Palace next weekend.

1922~~~
If anything, i'd bench him for City - even if he isn't injured - and ease him back in with a start against Palace, which is a much easier game on paper.

The ideal scenario is of course that he starts against City, and helps us win the game. Just not sure if he'll be 100% given the lack of recent match practice, and in a game as intense as this one, you need to be.

1923~~~
We need Wayne Rooney for City.

1924~~~
I'm about as far away from a Rooney doubter or hater as you can get. But i'm just not sure it's the right game to be making a comeback in. There is a possibility of him suffering a bit of ring rust. That wouldn't necessarily matter in an easier fixture, but away to City . . ?

There's also an element of protecting the player. You just know that if we lose - and there's a good chance we will - he'll more than likely be blamed by the usual suspects.

Ease him in against Palace, and have him ready to give Arsenal a shooeing.

1925~~~
We need him vs City. If he was limping slightly yesterday, I doubt it will be any concern. Game is still 5 days away.

1926~~~
Hes normally quite good against city isn't he? But its important IMO to get him back as hes also a big game player, a physical presence out there along with providing so much work rate. He also guarantees goals or assists as he has always been so productive, so hopefully he is fit and the knock was just a tiny thing, nothing more then just limping yesterday.

1927~~~
What better than that?

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.soccer-training-info.com/images/rooney_goal.gif" src="http://www.soccer-training-info.com/images/rooney_goal.gif"/>

1928~~~
That was at OT.

1929~~~
Thought we were talking about Rooney goals against City in general.

1930~~~
It would be a big boost to have him back, but only if he is 100% fit. He is always dreadful when he plays through injury.

1931~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M4JHEqKl_Dk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

In terms of the quality of goal I think this is the pick of the bunch, but obviously it was inconsequential and is a game we all want to forget...

1932~~~
Rooney? Dribbling past someone? Hasn't done that since he was 18. Explosive etc.

1933~~~
I was at that game. 

I remember travelling with my mate and he asked me 'Score predictions?'

And I replied with, 'I just think we might nick something...Moyes has a great record against Man City.'

The end.

1934~~~
He pretty much did <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.itv.com/sport/football/article/2013-07-22/david-moyes-has-a-better-record-against-man-city-than-fergie-in-the-last-four-years/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">have their number</a> with Everton - something like 7 wins in his last 10 games against them. And Fellaini was usually at the heart of it. That's why I thought we'd get something that afternoon as well. Needless to say, it didn't quite go to plan . . .

1935~~~
Has there been any more talk of this supposed injury?

1936~~~
Last (and only thing) I heard was that he had a limp at a sponsor event (that was a few days ago). Haven't seen anything since then. Probably just a knock at training...maybe...hopefully.

1937~~~
Speaking of Rooney goals vs City, reminded me of his winner against them in the League Cup during his prolific 09/10 season.

Ahh, still remember the 09/10 season like it was yesterday....

3, count it, <b>THREE stoppage time winners against Man City that season..</b>

Sounds like he'll be good to go, according to ESPN FC.

1943~~~
Brilliant news, if Rooney comes back fired up and in the same form previous to his suspension we're gonna give City a very difficult time.

1944~~~
He's going to be rusty as feck with the touch of an elephant.

1945~~~
I dont reckon he's been out long enough for rustiness to be a problem, he'll be fine.

1946~~~
You do realize he was still training while banned? Its not like he hasn't touched a ball in 3 weeks, they train twice a day.

1947~~~
Plus he's played two competitive games with England.

1948~~~
yeah, i think this is different from when he returns from injury per se. i know he takes ages to get back into the swing of things, but he shouldn't be too rusty.

1949~~~
I haven't wanted to see Rooney's name on the team sheet as much as I do right now in a very long time. Really weird feeling. He just seems to suit the way Van Gaal likes to set us up, and he's in better form than both Van Persie and Falcao right now. I hope he turns up.

1950~~~
Yup we need him and need him badly.

1951~~~
It wasn't mind games this time. They completely made up those injury stories. A journo mate of mine was at that event and said there was f-all wrong with Rooney. He said they are so desperate to write stories about United they often do stuff like that.

1952~~~
Glad we're back to the media iron blanket scheme of old. All the leaks and counter-briefings of last season grew tiresome before long. Anyway seems like the mole(s) - as it were, is now gone/ has been restrained.

1953~~~
He's lucky City haven't punished his many errors so far. Awful first 10 minutes.

1954~~~
His passing has always been too inconsistent to play CM, as a number 10 great, but in CM he just gives the ball away far too frequently

1955~~~
Why on earth is he playing as a CM?  He's not a CM, will never be one.

1956~~~
This. It's a problem and it could well cost us the game - as is the case whenever he's played there.

We've got Herrera sat on the bench ffs.

1957~~~
This is baffling. Our third highest scorer of all time is playing CM ffs.

1958~~~
Van Persie MUST play, Rooney MUST play. Tactics seem to be squeezed around them, rather than the other way 'round.

Shame, it'll cost us over the season.

1959~~~
That's not the problem. Why not play him as a #10 instead of Fellaini?

1960~~~
Because of the form Fellaini's in, I guess.

Fellaini earned his start for his last two appearances. Rooney's out of form and being played out of position - he gives possession away so much it's almost surreal.

1961~~~
Because Fellaini is not that good as a CM, not that Rooney is.

1962~~~
Bit rich of Rooney to bark at Toni for losing the ball after Wayne's opening 15 minutes

1963~~~
Gotta say I missed those long diagonal pointless passes, I knew we were lacking something in last 3 games.

1964~~~
How much has it hurt us playing Rooney in that key role in the first half?

It has undoubtedly cost us our shape and made us much more unstable.

Madness when Herrera's sat on the bench...

1965~~~
Has never been and never will be a midfielder. He's a fantastic striker and no more. Like a broken record.

1966~~~
Thought he did good in the first half.

1967~~~
Don't get the point of the set up today pre the sending off. Rooney deeper in cm basically thinks it's about playing a few short passes and then launch it long and we completely wasted outnumbering them in the middle when it was even numbers.

1968~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1969~~~
I'd much rather see Rooney in his preferred role, even if it means dropping Fellaini out of the team again.

1970~~~
Aye but Rooney is the better player and will get you more goals and assists from the #10 role than Fellaini. 

LVG has got this wrong. It's fecking stupid.

1971~~~
Horrible game so far, hopefully this is LVGs last experiment and we can just play Rooney up front from now on

1972~~~
Herrera should have played

1973~~~
Fellaini isn't playing as number ten either, altough he is more offensive than Rooney.

1974~~~
That said, he's not been bad after the first 10 minutes or so. Defensively good, had a good burst going forward and played a couple of nice passes.

1975~~~
Probably, or just have Fellaini actually play as a central midfielder and make the most of his height by first building up an attack and the getting him in the box and having Rooney forward rather than having Fellaini push up straight as we cross the half way line, the midfield options then drying up resulting in Rooney having to drop deep to then play a long switch or it going back to the defenders.

1976~~~
I thought he did alright, considering he's playing out of position. Good defensive work, and one great through ball to release Di Maria. But a couple of wayward passes also (hardly alone in that regard).

Never wanted him to start though, precisely because he was always going to get absolutely slaughtered if we didn't win, regardless of his actual performance.

1977~~~
Bit rusty but then again, to me he's looked rusty all season.

Despise those stupid slow cross field passes he does that nearly always get cut out.

1978~~~
You do realise that Rooney will not be playing up front right as first choice right? EVER. RVP and Falcao ahead of him. Both better strikers. The only way he'll play is if they're injured.

1979~~~
Rooney hasn't been good or bad, just average, he shouldn't be played in this position right.

1980~~~
as second striker, whatever. You can call it up front or midfield if you like, he has never played well right in the centre of midfield and it just needs to stop. Mata would probably have been worse in that role today, so it's out of necessity I guess, but for gods sake can we not just promote a youth CM or sign a Fing centre mid so we can stop playing make shift players there.

Difference between City and United is City have 2 players for every position and united have 1, and if that player gets injured we shuffle in a player with mismatched skill sets to do a job, It's been going on for years and it's getting boring. I know it took city time and 100s of millions to get to this position but we need to start making at effort to do it

1981~~~
When Herrera broke his rib we were told his recovery time would be 6 weeks, we rushed him back and he looked a shadow of his true self against West Brom. If he's still injured there's no point playing him.

Rooney hasn't done badly, he hasn't been wonderful but he hasn't been rubbish. I actually feel if we can get him a strike at goal within 30 yards of Hart's net Rooney can win us the game. One thing he isn't is shot shy, like everyone else seemingly is.

1982~~~
feck off with your slow diagonals that are being intercepted ffs.

1983~~~
He's had a good game, good to have him back.

1984~~~
So many City attacks have come from this.

1985~~~
Our best attacking player

1986~~~
Probably our best attack minded player on the day - but will still attract most of the criticism, despite being a striker/second striker playing in midfield against the current league champions.

1987~~~
Why on Earth didn't he just shoot rather than trying to win a penalty? His decision making is awful.

1988~~~
He was very good, one of our best players.

1989~~~
Busted his ass in the second half. Had a nervy start to the match however. Hopefully will go from strength to strength now.

1990~~~
Was quite easily our best attacking player even from his role in CM. Wish he'd shot from that magical run though. Would have been some goal!

1991~~~
Much better in the second half. Really expected a goal once he got past Kompany.

1992~~~
Fantastic in the 2nd half both defensively and offensively.

1993~~~
First half his passing was poor and slow. Upped his game in the second half and it was from that he run he did that the team suddenly started to look they could create something. Hopefully that was only cramp at the end!

1994~~~
Indeed. Gave his all and managed to keep up with things despite lacking match fitness.

1995~~~
Very good second half. Should have shot earlier for the opportunity he had.

1996~~~
Good 2nd half performance from Wayne "can't dribble since 1975" Rooney...

1997~~~
Much better in the second half but a lot of heavy touches and misplaced passes (by no means the only one and probably just rusty) and needs to stop trying to diagonally pass it 80 yards, it doesn't work. Ever. Stop it.

1998~~~
Stepped it up in the second half where he was really good. A few useless balls out wide but he give us so much effort and drive it's hard to criticise him for a few poor passes.

1999~~~
Didn't look at the races in the first half an hour (possibly down to match fitness), but played like a captain of Manchester United in the second half. He was fantastic.

2000~~~
Our best player today. Showed drive, aggresion and willed the team forward.

Just imagine if Mata was playing there instead of Rooney, we really need him and is vital to us.

2001~~~
Mixed performance. Thought he was excellent in the last half hour.

Don't think him playing CM suits him really, but he did a decent enough job.

2002~~~
Started awfully then, especially in the second half, got better with each passing minute.

Welbeck syndrome can't be excused though. Great dribble but does too much and one of our best openings becomes a scrappy affair in which we should have scored but didn't through his poor choice.

2003~~~
Good performance. He's never a central midfielder, though.

2004~~~
Absolutely superb once he settled. Really enjoyed his performance today....

2005~~~
Tremendous performance from him. Defending for Valencia at RB, to a near goal run himself... he was immense.

2006~~~
Yeah he was our best player again today, but I dont think Van Gaal should be experimenting with him in CM.

2007~~~
That one run was fantastic, and then he tried to turn in when he should have kept going. Good game though, nice to have him back.

2008~~~
Ran around a lot but with no real quality on the ball. Few decent moments but struggled overall. Game was a fast pace and wore out very quickly

2009~~~
That run was brilliant. Needed to get a shot off though. Started a bit rusty but got better. Worked himself into the ground. Well and truly ahead of Mata at the minute.

2010~~~
looked rusty at times...but showed why we need him so much.

2011~~~
Started playing well around 70th minute, everything started from that great run he's made. Other than that, nope.

Not that he's the only one to blame, mind.

2012~~~
Wish he had pulled the trigger after that run. Played OK really considering he's had a month off.

2013~~~
Did well today overall considering it was his first game back. Should have finished off that great run with a goal on his left and i'm sure he would have scored it if he'd have taken it.

2014~~~
Can't believe he didn't shoot... that was THE Wayne Rooney derby day moment.

Overall - Some very good stuff, some pretty rubbish stuff.

2015~~~
Had a good 15 minutes at the start of the game and another good 15 at the end. Was sandwiched by 60 minutes of mediocrity though. Constantly gave the ball away when playing the flashy pass. Wasn't a very good performance. But then again he's only back from injury and playing in a position he's never been great in.

2016~~~
Started the game badly with a few misplaced passes and repeated hollywood passes that even Johnson could have defended but did very well in the second half when we were pressuring City in search of a goal. He simply walks into the team for me in place of Mata. Mata wouldn't have been half as good as that had he played, I swear.

2017~~~
I said he's always shit whenever he comes back after missing any games and was shot down.

2018~~~
The last 30 minutes today reminded me of the old Wayne Rooney. We need him to perform like that on regular basis.

2019~~~
Why couldn't Van Gaal have made DDG captain? What is gained by having to shoe-horn Rooney into every starting 11 whenever's he's available even if it means playing him in ridiculously out of position - like CM against a top team?

Argh it really annoys me.

2020~~~
Did well towards the end of the game and was one of the main reasons we were close to getting anything from the game. Superb run through on goal, just wish he'd hit it with his left.

2021~~~
He is probably our best player at the moment...

2022~~~
Bizarre post.He had a very good game <span style="text-decoration: underline">again</span> today.

2023~~~
He hasn't played for 3 matches... and we did great against Chelsea without him.

Watch the first half again.

Not that I blame Rooney.

2024~~~
Had a shaky start but worked himself into the game. Was definitely better in the second half, especially in the last 20 mins or so. That run, though. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

What I like about Rooney, though, even if he is having a bad game and giving away the ball, like he did a few times in the first half, he doesn't shy away from the ball, and is pretty much always in the game. You need characters like that.

2025~~~
JUPITER did Rooney bang your girl or something?

You seem to be the only person stuck on this. Yes, he shoulsdn't have played in CM but he was id very well all things considered. Not the reason why we lost

2026~~~
That run if he scored would have been the best Rooney moment ever. Reminded me of Higuains run in the world cup when he megged Kompany.

2027~~~
Didn't show any signs of lack of fitness and game practice which is usually case with him when he is out. Few misplaced passes early in first half apart, he had a decent game.

2028~~~
Plenty of games to come this season, and i'm sure he still has lots of great goals in him yet.

2029~~~
There's no doubt that Rooney wasn't great in the first half, but do you also criticise Di Maria, who also hasn't had the greatest of games in the last couple of weeks? If not, that really pees me off, because it just shows you have some sort of personal vendetta against Rooney.

2030~~~
I really like Rooney as a player, I don't blame him for being played wildly out of position! But as I've said elsewhere - 

Watch the first half again and count how many times possession is gifted, unpressured, to City due to Rooney being played as a CM.

Watch how much pressure is invited onto our already makeshift defence because of this.

Count how many wild, cross field hollywoods are given straight to City for them to run straight down our weak right hand side and attack the vulnerable Valencia and Smalling.

2031~~~
Thought he was ok first half and then very good second half. Problems are individualities really though at the moment, it's getting them to perform cohesively.

2032~~~
Go to the Di Maria thread and search my name.

And I blame LvG for playing Rooney out of position, I'm a massive fan of Rooney, have been all his career.

2033~~~
Did we? I dont think so. Mata was awful and we would probably have won if Rooney was playing, he was just what was missing from that match

Watch the second half again.

2034~~~
Every 5 or 10 minutes, I just stop and say "Why didn't you shoot Wayne? Whyyyyyyyy!?"

I need help.

2035~~~
Why did he turn inside on that brilliant run? Thought he was gonna toe poke it near post

2036~~~
<b>ON DI MARIA</b>


<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That, in comparison to the stuff you've posted on Rooney? Behave!

2037~~~
Bit rusty but is to be expected, worked hard and almost inspired an equaliser, good to have him back.

2038~~~
I hope we can see more of the Rooney from the second half and not so much of the Rooney from the first half this season.

2039~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  Nice one.

2040~~~

Pointless balls
feck off Rooney

To

Best attacking
Played well
One of our best players

This thread is bipolar <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

For me he had a rusty first 10 but played well after that, I have to admit though when he was running back like a bull after Toure I was waiting for a Red card tackle, but he didn't and won the ball. Good performance for a 10 man squad, getting better at his captain duties.

2041~~~
The thing you seem incapable/unwilling to acknowledge is that I'm not criticising Rooney - I'm criticising Van Gaal for playing him there.

You asked if I'd pulled up Di Maria's relatively poor game - and I had.

But the thing you're clearly not grasping is that I don't believe Di Maria's position cost us the game, whereas I believe Rooney being played in CM effectively cost us the game in the first half.

2042~~~
Same here.

You could almost feel his feet getting itchy to lash out. Heaved a huge sigh of relief after the tackle.

2043~~~
Not with this post youre not

2044~~~
Thought he drove the team on in the 2nd half. Obviously a bit rusty but that was to be expected. Much better than his usual performances after a lay off.

2045~~~
Played well considering how long he has been out for. Cramps towards the end of the match probably rendered him less effective in injury time. Great barnstorming run through the middle of the pitch. Havent seen that in a long time from him.

2046~~~
I'm <i>directly</i> criticising Van Gaal for making Rooney (or any striker) captain. How am I criticising Rooney for being made captain, it's not his decision, is it?

Strikers should always be picked on form, not because they're the captain. And if you're gonna pick Rooney every game at least play him in position.

That's my criticism, do you understand?

2047~~~
Oh, so it had nothing to do with Smalling getting sent off?

And why the feck do you keep talking about the first half? The games is two halves. I could understand if Rooney made a mistake and City scored, but he didn't. Yes, he gave away possession a few times, but you can't say a player 'cost us the game' if something he did wrong didn't result in City capitalizing.

Would you say Di Maria 'cost us the game' in the second half when he was out of position for Aguero's goal?

2048~~~
I cant be asked to get into this with you, and yes I understand where you're coming from very well.

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OOgt50xMVtL/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

2050~~~
Love that. I'd like to see him do it a lot more, mind. Reminiscent of a young Rooney.

2051~~~
Started by a crap first touch

2052~~~
Ugh. Why didn't he shoot!!

2053~~~
Our entire shape was compromised because of this issue. And our entire possession game was lost because of this issue. These are the factors that got us a point against Chelsea - our shape and our possession, this is what our football is about now.

Our back 4 was very, very weak, we knew this, and from those cross field hollywoods in the first half we gave City free run at our weakest element - our right side, which is where our red came from. Yes, I do blame Smalling, but Smalling isn't good enough to deal with pressure like that. Van Gaal IS good enough to know what playing strikers in CM will result in.

If we'd played the exact same tactics today with Herrera or Carrick in CM and played Rooney instead of RvP as a striker I think we'd have won the game. 

You simply can't play a striker in that CM role in a team that's based on possession football, not against top opposition. You're throwing the game right there.

You can laugh off what I'm saying now, but if Van Gaal does it again against a top team I guarantee you it'll hold the exact same consequence.

2054~~~
Has he ever scored with his left foot? I am struggling to think of any right now

2055~~~
Started off really poorly with the passes but then was great after. Should have shot after his run instead of cutting in though. Great to have him back.

2056~~~
Explode!

2057~~~
Damn, he should have shot it.. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> He was through on goal.

2058~~~
Probably the only thing I keep asking a question about his performance today. Man, he had that momentum after making Kompany look shite.

Otherwise, he did well for a first match after a suspension.

2059~~~
What a load of rubbish! We bossed the game for most of the first half with Rooney in centre midfield, with Fellaini and Blind. If I didn't know where Rooney played, I wouldn't have said he looked out of place in midfield today. I felt our shape and our possession was fine against City until the sending off. We weren't exactly getting torn apart before that, were we? Even after Smalling got sent off we looked pretty organised. 

Smalling is good enough to deal with pressure like that. Actually, I'd say Smalling's a very intelligent player who normally deals with those situations a lot better. Today was an uncharacteristic mistake. Also, the goal come from us not clearing our lines. 

Based on what? Herrera was poor against West Brom, losing possession a number of times, and has since been dropped by an in form Fellaini. 

Anyone can lose possession in midfield, striker or no striker. Like I said above, Herrera lost possession a lot of times against West Brom and he's a centre midfielder. Your point?

Well, today I didn't think we looked out of place, even when we went down to 10, and this is supposed to be a 'top team'. I also maintain that we were the better team with eleven men on the pitch.

2060~~~
He does. Rooney scores a variety of goals, for all his faults. Off the top of my head, one of the goals in his hat trick debut was a left footer.

Also, am I the only one who thinks his run today was because he miscontrolled the ball? But he did okay today, I think.

2061~~~
I think city read it every time he tried to smash it out to the right today. Sometimes looked as if they intentionally opened up for him to hit that pass so they could dispossess and counter. Felt Rooney mixed it up more towards the end.

2062~~~
Our shape was conceded by the decisions LvG made in order to squeeze Rooney and Van Persie into the starting 11 - that's why he changed formation from the Chelsea game, which he shouldn't have done. Watch both games again if you want to develop an understanding of this point.

Our possession game, <i>which is what our football is supposed to be about now</i> was thrown away by playing a striker in CM. Wayne Rooney isn't very good at holding on to possession when passing, it's probably the weakest part of his game. Playing him in that key role broke the 'philosophy' and equalled our entire possession game going out the window. Again, watch the Chelsea match again and then watch the first half against City to gain an understanding of this.

A striker who is prone to giving away possession in midfield is always more likely to give up possession in midfield than an actual midfielder. Watch the first half again and count how many times possession is squandered under no pressure by Rooney in midfield and you'll see what I mean.

2063~~~
Don't patronize me. I think it's you that needs to watch the games and again see that we stuck to Van Gaal's philosophy and bossed the game. As Neville said about 15 mins into the game, City's players couldn't get near us, and were chasing shadows, at times. Our formation was exactly the same as it was against Chelsea. All that changed was Rooney replacing Mata in the midfield. 

I love how you completely ignore my points. You keep talk about Rooney giving away possession in the first half (why you keep mentioning the first half when the game is two halves, I don't know) but as I said, Herrera give away possession a lot against West Brom, so who's to say he wouldn't have done it today? Who cares if he's an 'actual' midfielder. Fact is, Rooney's being played in midfield because he's always been a player to drop off and use his great passing range. Not exactly new to him. He did it under SAF, hence why he wanted to leave. 

Also, can you please stop telling me to watch the first half. It's getting really annoying now. A game doesn't last for 45 minutes.

2064~~~
Just gonna have to agree to disagree aren't we, mate? We clearly don't see eye to on the last couple of games and I think we're just annoying each other here.

For 15 minutes at the start we did well...and then we started gifting them our possession and it all came from the striker we played as a CM. This lost us our game plan, our shape and directly placed massive pressure on our weakest element - right side defence.

Our formation and set up wasn't the same as the Chelsea match.

2065~~~
Apart from the ever present pointless diagonal passes he did well today.

2066~~~
Beautiful run and an exquisite turn to make himself some space just after half time, our best player today

2067~~~
I guess we'll have to, but what I'm trying to say, Rooney losing possession a few times (although Di Maria was also dispossessed a number of times), didn't lose us the game. If our shape was lost, it was because we had one less player, not because of Rooney. If that happened against Chelsea, it would've been the same. 




What did you see that was different to the Chelsea game?

2068~~~
Wonderful run in the match just a shame it didn't result in a goal.

2069~~~
Best game as a 10 in a long time.

Still rather see him up front as a 9 and one of Falcao or Van Persie leave and the money earmarked for them put towards a wide attacker with pace. 

But he played quite well.

2070~~~
Rooney did a lot of whinging today.

2071~~~
This

Those floated (often under hit) diagonals to Di Maria really did cut the momentum of numerous attacks today. Not sure I like Rooney in the 3 though, he did ok but not as well as Mata did last week (imo) or Herrera or Di Maria would do in there (IMO)

2072~~~
Wayne is a striker, and is a damn good ome. Playing him in the midfield was a gamble, but he looked decent. Would still prefer Herrera there.

2073~~~
He did.

He's out of his depth being played in CM though, and also out of his depth as a captain - which I think leads him to shout a lot in an effort to be a 'good leader'.

I'm sure LvG regrets his decision to make him captain. It was a daft decision for all concerned.

2074~~~
Who would you rather have as captain? Rooney was the best option we had and honestly, he's the only one we have on the pitch who closely resembles a leader. He works his socks off and gives it his all and is absolutely all over. He was the best choice we had for captain and we didn't have many.

2075~~~
Has this been posted? Found it amusing:

<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/u6DiO4pnk1/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

Thought he was the best player on the pitch today mind.

2076~~~
It's weird, I can't work out why Van Gaal made a rod for his own back by saying Rooney was undroppable. He could've just quietly never dropped him and let people draw their own conclusions. Then he'd have the flexibility to drop him if he ever needed and journalists wouldn't be able throw his words back in his face in stories speculating about why the undroppable player has been dropped. 

Having said that you wouldn't drop him now anyway. Really want to see him play striker again.

2077~~~
DDG, without a doubt.

Rooney's a great player and a spirited lad but he's not actually a <i>leader</i> on the pitch. Never has been. He works best with less responsibility.

There's a difference between running around shouting and leading.

2078~~~
DDG was never going to be made captain really.

2079~~~
When there was a poll over the summer I voted DDG for captain. It would have been bold but I think he was the best candidate. Especially given out massive Spanish-speaking contingent.

2080~~~
Overall pretty good today, especially in the second half. Inspiring stuff really. If only he would've finished that magnificent run off, it would have been one of those great moments!

2081~~~
Can't believe not dropping Rooney is being used as a stick to beat Van Gaal. Rooney should start every game regardless, barring an unprecedented loss of form. Making this an issue after today's game, where he was one of our better players, is even weirder.

Of course. Van Gaal's apparent reluctance to drop other players is more worthy of discussion. Not in this thread though.

2082~~~
Why? He's going to start every game, and a team should be built from the back. Plus we desperately want him to sign a new contract.

Why build a rod for yourself by selecting a high profile striker and then publicly announcing that they'll always play regardless of form? It was silly.

Strikers should play on form and there should be constant competition for every striker in the squad - Rooney has none, neither does RvP it seems.

Also, you want other managers to be second guessing which striker/s you'll pick so it's more difficult to prepare against you - every game, every team knows that Rooney will play (and RvP tbh).

Nah, Van Gaal is the right man to lead us forward and has done some great work throughout our build up play and possession but he's mishandled having 3 top class strikers.

2083~~~
Wayne is God.

2084~~~
Seriously needs to start being more picky with when to hit those cross-field passes. I don't know how many interceptions Clichy collected from him today. Other than that he looks fitter than ever, when's the last time you saw Wayne Rooney making runs like that, it was great to see.

2085~~~
That hollywood ball needs to die with fire.

2086~~~
That run he made symbolized everything that is Wayne Rooney. Absolute determination and drive in the run mixed in with flashes of quality yet when it came to solidifying his abilities into a finished product, he failed. Potential to be a world beater, but could never get there - you still admire the heart.

2087~~~
I thought he was very good to be fair.

But yes, that slow shit driffty out ball needs to feck off, I wouldn't mind if if he put some pace on it, but its worse than useless the way he does it.

2088~~~
Surprisingly poignant post! You're right as well.

2089~~~
230 odd goals suggests that the end product is there more often than not though.

2090~~~
He didn't even play as a 10. Was clearly in CM.

2091~~~
Rooney was excellent today, aside from the first 5 minutes when he gave the ball away horrifically twice and it looked like it was going to be one of his shite performances. I was really pleased with the way he turned it round.

I think he's quite suited to CM in the 4-1-4-1 we played today, but the issue I have is that today he was usually the deeper of the middle two whilst Fellaini was more advanced. Rooney showed far more appetite for the defensive aspect of the game and is much more switched on when tracking runners than Fellaini is. I'd love to see a midfield three of Blind, Herrera and Rooney, so Rooney can get further up the midfield and doesn't have to do so much defensive work.

2092~~~
Is he feck. Someone who will almost certainly go down as the most prolific goal-scorer in the history of Manchester United football club will be remembered for lacking end product? Jesus wept. The drivel being posted on here today...

2093~~~
Nah, I think the poster was saying that he didn't ever quite meet his initial potential as being an 'all time great'. Don't think he was suggesting that Rooney has no end product.

He's a United legend (imo at least) but he's never quite realised that initial potential.

2094~~~
No offence man, but Rooney was well off his game today. He had that run on goal & then a spurt at the end of the game, but that was it. He did f*ck all to justify the "very good" tag or £300k per week more importantly..

2095~~~
Stop posting it then Pogue <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2096~~~
The analogy is bogus though. He's using a great run to slam Rooney for not finishing the chance. Rooney usually has great end product so it doesn't wash. That kind of run from Rooney is what United fans have been craving for years. It's actually atypical of his play and can not be used to make some kind of greater point about his career. If he combines his usual excellent end product with some exciting run then he will be well up there performance wise.

2097~~~
His intensity today showed why he is a better option than Mata in a big game (and lesser games too).

2098~~~
Leopard, spots etc...

2099~~~
I think the poster was saying that the run was <i>analogous</i> of Rooney's career, rather that it being <i>characteristic</i> of something he does often when playing...

That's what I got from it anyway, you'd probably be better off asking the poster themselves.

2100~~~
You could take any run from Ronaldo/Messi that did not result in a goal and make the same point. But obviously that would be totally unrelated and a bit ridiculous. Which it is here.

If it's another 'Rooney didn't meet my expectations' comment' then you will find it's a bit of a worn track.

2101~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's completely wrong as well, that run opened City up and created a chance albeit which Di Maria really should have scored. Was a fantastic save by Hart though

Wasn't a huge fan of Rooney being given the captaincy in the summer but as things stand he is the only attacker who should be starting every match.

2102~~~
Yeah, I was being lazy, but sure. Most advanced midfielder in a 3, at least.

2103~~~
I don't think he even was that. Fellaini seemed much highe.

2104~~~
You couldn't really as in their careers they've 'finished off' their initial potential. If you get me.

2105~~~
Yeah he was a CM, Fellaini played further forward.

2106~~~
Of course you could make that point, in the analogy we're talking about the run, not anything that is typical about their careers as you said before.

 This is a very murky subject. Potential is nothing, a sperm could outplay 10 Messi's but it will be 1 in 100 million if it's as good as Rooney.

2107~~~
What?

2108~~~
A sperm has the potential to outplay Messi greatly. It most likely will not, but it at least has the potential to do so. At some point it's best to forget about potential and just realise what's actually there.

2109~~~
My sperm is amazing at football. I've wanted to say that for so long but I thought everyone would think I was mental.

2110~~~
Haha. It's so good even before conception and 18 years of football training, thats impressive. Does it have an agent?

2111~~~
No its like Scholes. One club sperm. If it never makes the team it would rather not play than play for someone else.

2112~~~
I thought he was decent today, especially considering the terrible first 5 minutes and his usual pedigree for returning from absence horrendously out of fitness and sharpness.

Agree that the cross-field pass has to stop. I said to my Dad that I truely believe it's been coached I to him from SAF's Ronaldo days, to the point it's become instinctive.

I thought his work rate was as good as anyone else on the pitch and he looked good on the ball, losing it far less in tight situations than he normally does. His run to set up ADM was great as well, really sparked something in the team to get us finishing on the front foot. Not perfect but, in the circumstances, as much of a captain's performance as I've seen from him to date.

2113~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I say this with fondness, not malice, but you're not really sure what an analogy is, are you?

2114~~~
Decent today. 

That run was lovely <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Looked like the old explosive, young Rooney.

2115~~~
I love Wayne Rooney. He comes with his flaws (who doesnt?) but it just feels right when he's on the pitch. He's a leader.

We will turn things around, I'm sure of it, and Wayne will play a big part of it.

2116~~~
Fellaini sort of man-marked Fernando yesterday so its not surprising to see him higher up the pitch. He was also an outlet for our long balls. I thought Rooney did well to influence the play from a deeper position. There were several times he received the ball under from pressure from two players and he turned them briliantly.

2117~~~
Quickest I've seen him look in ages, just such a shame he didn't shoot when he had the chance.

It makes you wonder why he doesn't use his pace more often?. Maybe he's playing within himself a little to help preserve his body more.

2118~~~
You don't seem to understand yourself. If you're making the analogy from a run that doesn't result in a goal to Rooney's career, you can make this analogy from any run from any player. It's analogous, it doesn't have to be the actual player you're making a point about. One could make an analogy from a Beckham cross to Zidane's career, there is no contradiction in that.

Taking a atypical behaviour (like a poor Beckham cross) and analogising to someone's career would be confusing and nonsensical. You 'can' do so if you wish, it's still an analogy of sorts, but it's a poorly thought out one.

Also, taking a positive action (like a good dribble) to then make a negative sprawling comment about that very same player is poor from and self-contradictory too. Far away from poignant, it's all over the place.

2119~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Jupiter understands the deeper point I made in that post. My post was playing on the consensus of this forum that Rooney never reached the heights of Messi/Ronaldo that was expected of him at young age. That was the 'end product' I was talking about. English is not my first language, but hopefully you can reread my post and understand the analogy I was making now.

2120~~~
I agree. It's so obvious before he does it too that the defence know it is coming and intercept it easily. Needs to try and change it up a bit.

2121~~~
Why is his pace so inconsistent? He showed he still has it with that burst to create a chance but there was another incident where he was chasing Toure and he looked lightning slow.

2122~~~
Toure is pretty quick when he gets going, but I think Rooney was cramping up a bit at that point too so that wouldn't have helped.

2123~~~
This lad knows more than the lot of you!

2124~~~
Annoys the feck out of me. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/> And people wonder why we have no creativity through the middle.

2125~~~
Mata is a better no 10

2126~~~
The burst from the middle was awesome. He has the ability, don't know why he doesn't do it more often.

2127~~~
He was amazing in the second half. He was everywhere and showed he is a better option than Mata. 

RVP  is the one that should make way when Falcao gets back. But it will be interesting to see what happens.

2128~~~
That run through the middle was bloody brilliant, vintage Rooney stuff. Only regret is he could have taken the shot on his left and caught Hart out at his near post. Got my butt off the chair with that.

2129~~~
Looks in wonderful shape.

2130~~~
Dont understand why he didn't just have a crack at goal, i am sure he will regret that.

Just lacks that killer edge that the worlds best strikers have, and always seems to wanna put it on his right foot!

2131~~~
I used to think that but he hasn't proved it at all this season. Did nothing while Rooney was suspended.

2132~~~
Fantastic 2nd half from him. That's the Rooney I want to see.

2133~~~
Best player for us, really good in midfield. First 25 mins his little flicks round the corners with Fellaini worked really well, dominated our midfield worked well alongside Fellaini and Blind, great to have him back. 

Thought LVG made a mistake with putting him on the same side as Shaw. Would have thought he would have been better defensively than Di Maria so I would have played him on the right and Di Maria on the left. As Shaw should be a better LB than Valencia is RB was my thinking. And potentially that caught us out with the goal. Valencia too narrow and Di Maria didnt quite fill the gap (Although great pass from Yaya.)

2134~~~
Shoot Dammit!

2135~~~
Rooney up top please! Herrera in midfield thanks.

2136~~~
This is what I am leaning towards too. Even though Wayne doesn't prefer to play there it seems, he would give us more pace and work rate than RvP.

2137~~~
This would improve us massively plus I really like to see Falcao given a run once he's finally fit

2138~~~
But, but, but, where will Van Persie play?

Lets stick Rooney in midfield, Carrick and Herrera can stay on the bench, shove Di Maria out on the wing and then we have a place for RvP AND Rooney on the pitch together at all times!

It's like a badly played game of Tetris <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2139~~~
Had he dribbled his way to goal yesterday...

2140~~~
Rooney was excellent yesterday, he also seems to play well vs City and his run from midfield was one of the highlights of the match. The problem he has in when he's given too much time, he's much better when the first decisions made for him, like the run he had was started because the ball broke his way in a challenge and from there it was just instinct, that's how he needs to play. I think when he's given too much time he takes three, four, five touches and just can't make his mind up what to do and ends up messing up a 5 yard pass inside. I think out of all our players  LVG will really push Rooney on because he will challenge him to be better, to improve.

2141~~~
I think the Captaincy changed him a bit. I get a feeling that he is trying to engineer 'something for the team' rather than finish a clinical goal upfront. Laudable qualities, but the fact remains that he should not get into a situation where he lets his strike rate decline.

2142~~~
Man, you would think he was world class yesterday reading some of the comments. 
In those 15 minutes or so when we dominated the midfield, he was the worst midfielder out of three giving away the possession quite easily with simple passes resulting in City counterattacking and creating few good chances in first half. Clichy end up the game as player with highest number of interceptions thanks to Rooney's pointless diagonal passes to the right wing resulting in City counterattacking every single time from it. He end up the game as our fourth worst passer accuracy wise, only di Maria, Januzaj and de Gea had the worst passing accuracy and I think he made the most wrong passes in total in our team which is quite shit for a midfielder, but for some reason he was "our best player yesterday", even though de Gea, Shaw were easily better, and Fellaini,Blind and even Valencia were probably at least on par with him. But hey, he yelled at some of our players showing his desire and energy when they made a wrong pass, that's what matters the most!

2143~~~
I thought Sparky detests Rooney but ^^ this guy is something else.

2144~~~
Many have said Rooney was our best attacker. Last time I checked, Blind, Shaw, DDG, Fellaini and a Valencia at RB (or anywhere) are not attackers.

2145~~~
I liked his performance, real captain-like performance. He was all over the place trying to make things happen. Tried to involve Di Maria a lot. Good to see him back to his best.

2146~~~

2147~~~
Rooney played well against City but he certainly wasn't excellent, too many poor crossfield balls and caught in possession a few times.
Even that great run through the middle he should have got a shot away, no need to try and drag the ball back on to his right foot.

2148~~~
Many have also said he was our best player in general, and that he was fantastic, excellent, etc. which clearly wasn't the case. I agree that he was our best attacker though, even though he wasn't really an attacker yesterday.

2149~~~
Completely agree with this. People have become desensitised to his mediocrity.

2150~~~
100% this.

Tbh you could say this after a game about Rooney over 4+ years now.

2151~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2152~~~
He was good in patches, especially late on. To start the game though he was rusty and gave the ball away a few times, but I can forgive him because it was his first game back.

2153~~~
His very first United goal.

2154~~~
He did a really neat move to free himself from Kolarov and Toure was it? in the second half.

2155~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANq2XUV4YQA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2156~~~
It wasn't Kolarov, he was injured in the warm up.

2157~~~
Agree, always said Mata was better but he's been invisable in most games he's played this season and was very disapointing when Rooney was out.

2158~~~
Mata probably feels his time is nearly up at United...probably off this January.

2159~~~
I think so too, which is sad because I like the guy but he's surplus at the moment, hopefully we can use him as bait for a good CD.

2160~~~
I still think Rooney is being misused here. Giving him a free roaming role kind of helps a bit on other areas, but I think we are still missing his brilliance up the field. Between injuries and stupidity, defence is anyways fecked up a bit right now and Rooney is not going to shore it up fully. 

Instruct him to stay disciplined in the middle with a bulk of his role upfront and we can try and outscore the opponents. So you can score 2, with AdM, Rooney and Falcao/RvP we certainly can score more. A attacking 3-3 draw is still better than a scrappy 1-1 draw.

2161~~~
It's a never ending debate but I have always felt he is better up front. He naturally comes deep to link in with the play. By starting him deeper, you get the same thing but just limit his goal threat. He plays pretty much the same way when up front but is in the box more often.

2162~~~
I am with you. I prefer him up top and then his own work ethic etc means he drops in to get the ball sometimes. As you say, if he is up top he ends up on the box more often. I also wonder if all that energy at #10 gets in other peoples spaces. I can imagine Mata would be able to do well behind Rooney and RvP/Falcao.

2163~~~
Bloody hell. Not bad, Wazz!

2164~~~
He just shouldn't be playing in midfield, ever. He's a top striker.

Playing Rooney in midfield is like having a Barracuta Harrington jacket and using it as a table cloth instead of wearing it out.

2165~~~
When I say deeper, I mean the 10 role.

2166~~~
Fair play, though I was talking about him being played in midfield by Van Gaal - as on Sunday.

2167~~~
Yeh, with our current options, I see no need for him ever to be considered in the centre of midfield.

2168~~~
If we're going to keep Falcao, the best option is still for Rooney to reinvent himself as a goalscoring left-sided attacker. It's worth a shot until January.

---------Falcao/RVP----------
Rooney----------Mata/Januzaj
-----DiMaria-----Herrera---
-------------Blind--------------

with Mata tucking in and Januzaj playing a bit wider depending on matchup and such. Rooney looking to come inside and Di Maria and Shaw overlapping him often enough. 

Though I think the diamond is more likely with Fellaini's form, Mata apparently being unable to play wide and Nani out on loan.

2169~~~
feck why can't he play up top and get on the end of crosses like in 2010? Absolute shame. He still has speed and strength. Not at top strikers need silky touches like RVP. Rooney is an amazing header of the ball and his finishing in close is better than RVP if you ask me.

2170~~~
Completely agree. Would love to see this for a few games at some point in the season...

------------------------DDG-----------------------
Rafael--------Jones----------McNair--------Shaw
------------------------Blind-----------------------
-------Carrick------------------------ADM---------
------------------------Herrera--------------------
-------------Rooney-------------Falcao------------

2171~~~
He's not a CM, if we are going to play 4-3-3 we need two proper box to box CM's in there with a DM and Rooney as one of the front 3, his first touch and short passing are not suited to midfield.

2172~~~
Playing him in midfield and shunting Di Maria to the wing is painful.

2173~~~
Drop RvP and play Rooney up front. Everyone can get back to being in their favorite positions. Or play Rooney behind RvP and Falcao. This current formation suits no one!

2174~~~
You as Rooney fan should know that his favourite position is behind the striker.

2175~~~
Did a good job defensively and was alright going forward but was playing far too deep. It's an utter waste of talent.

2176~~~
Yeah, this is Van Gaal's biggest mistake thus far imo, and it must stop.

I'd honestly rather Rooney was sold than played in midfield, and I love Rooney.

He's a fecking striker, and a good one! It's ridiculous.

And it doesn't even mean dropping RvP! Today we could've lined up with this...

<b>-----------------------DDG--------------------
Val---------McNair--------Blind---------Shaw
----------------------Carrick-------------------
------Fellaini----------------------ADM--------
-----------------------Mata---------------------
------------Rooney-----------RvP--------------</b>

Or this...

<b>-----------------------DDG--------------------
Val---------McNair--------Blind---------Shaw
----------------------Carrick-------------------
------Fellaini----------------------ADM--------
-----------------------Rooney---------------------
------------Wilson-------------RvP--------------</b>

2177~~~
He was good today. 

The "play him as a striker" gang is getting boring, he was shit every time he played striker this season and among our best players every single game when played behind the striker or midfield.

2178~~~
May be I should be looking into glasses, but I thought he had a bit of a stinker today. He looked a little tired and heavy footed, and he fluffed a couple of good finishing opportunities. Was much better against City last week, for instance.

I don't like him playing as deep as he does now, especially when RvP is doing next to nothing up top. But I think he's at his most influential in a more withdrawn role up top.

2179~~~
He was terrible today. Lost count of the how many times he dropped deep then played it put wide to Valencia. How about turn and play a killer pass or actually beat a man? Had a couple of good chances when Di Maria created space for him and stuck it wide every time. Watching him as a 10 is painful.

2180~~~
Fergie has said that it was difficult for him to adapt to new ways of playing or something to that effect..... he said Rooney tended to go back to what was familiar to him I guess when under pressure. Probably why he resorts to playing it out to the wings even if it's not the right thing to do at certain times.... ah well, it's for LVG & Co to sort out.

2181~~~
He was better than RvP, AdM and AnJaz. In the upper reaches of average, while they were in the middling part of average.

2182~~~
Please don't tell me this is a thing now?

2183~~~
His best moments in the game came from when he drifted out to the left and then cut in.

2184~~~
No, it's not a thing. It's just after i'd written RvP and AdM, I thought it would seem strange writing out Januzaj's full name.

2185~~~
Thank god for that.

2186~~~
In CM again I'm reading. I can understand it to an extent against City but don't understand playing him so deep vs Palace.

2187~~~
Spot on, i feel that we're missing out on a good striker at the moment, i understand the job he does in midfield that mata can't do, but rooney is a striker and i honestly don't believe for one second that he's happy playing that role in midfield.

2188~~~
This. I'd much rather have him return to the left hand role he was forced into when Ronaldo and Tevez were at the helm in 2008. Keep Di Maria central with the roaming role to interchange with Rooney and we'd instantly be better at transitioning from defence to attack via a ball carrier with pace.

2189~~~
Van Gaal has played a 433 for most of his career, and it seems that he's slowly introducing to Utd, which means Rooney has to play in centre midfield, as it seems unlikely Van Gaal will use him as a lone striker or a winger, although I wouldn't mind seeing him as an inverted winger, with Di Maria centre midfield. 

I don't think Rooney's the problem, though. Certainly wasn't today anyway. Thought he had a decent game today. Kept it well enough. I just think our front three had no cutting edge when they got the ball in good positions.

2190~~~
Didn't watch the game but so I can't comment.

Rooney isn't a problem but I think this system is good when playing good teams but against weaker teams I think we'd be better playing Mata or Rooney in the no.10 role. Whether it be the diamond of 4231

2191~~~
Bizarrely as he's gotten older he's become incredibly one footed - now he only even seems to 'see' one side of the pitch - to his right. It was amazing watching him receive balls on the left side of midfield, he'd never even look to see what Shaw was up to, his whole body shape and 'picture of the field' are what he can find to his right. 

Not a great trait for a player that wants to play in the hole, plus he used to be pretty two-footed. Dunno what the reason is. Too much time training with Giggsy! 

Credit where it's due though, he genuinely bailed us out a few times with defensive tracking back.

2192~~~
I see what you mean, but if Van Gaal wants to play a 433 in the future, then we need to keep playing it, thus allowing the players to get used to the system. For example, Barca always stick to a 433, regardless of who they play. I think if we want to be more of a threat against the 'weaker' teams, then we should be looking to change personnel, rather than the formation, although like I said, we got into good enough areas today but didn't make it count.

2193~~~
Was disappointed that he didn't test the keeper. Sure shooting from outside the area isn't something you should rely on, but top players should test the keeper. 

A few occasions where he wanted the pullback when he should've been making a run into the box. I think his goal scoring instinct is slowly disappearing and that needs to be stopped unless they genuinely believe he can play a deeper role and can pick up more tricks of the trade other than THAT pass out to the right.

I just want to see him have that moment where he's carried us forward and dragged us through a game. He's still not had that moment as captain. Again, I don't think its too much to expect from one of the top players in the squad - someone who made his name as a matchwinner.

2194~~~
Poor performance again. That said, he's never a midfielder and the more I watch him play there, the more I feel he can't be one in the future either

2195~~~
He's not good enough as a #10 or a midfielder.

2196~~~
He's not a #10, never was, never will be. Why LVG insists on playing him in that role is beyond me. Just play him up top as a striker.

2197~~~
Agree with most in here in that he isn't great as a CM.

2198~~~
Interesting that you think he only sees the right side of the field. This picture that <a class="username" data-user="64979, @Kostur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64979/">@Kostur</a> put up in the Fellaini thread shows he actually played more balls to the left.

2199~~~
Huh, well can't argue with facts, but I really thought he spent most of his time ignoring Shaw when attacking. Guess not!

2200~~~
See, that's the thing I think that a lot of people are guilty of when a certain player or trait of a player annoys them. I'm guessing the Rooney to the right thing annoys you, thus you focus on it, and see it happening more than the other things he does. I would have done likewise with - say Kagawa last year, and the amount of times I felt he turned and played a simple ball rather than trying to open something up.

2201~~~
Tbf to <a class="username" data-user="51769, @Beachryan" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/51769/">@Beachryan</a> all those passes to the left are short ones (i.e the ones that are less noticed) while all the passes to the right are the big long diagonals (that are a lot more noticeable and stick in the mind).

2202~~~
This, this and this.

2203~~~
True enough. I just personally feel that at least the balls Rooney plays generally are going forward, and also generally go to a teammate. It's not his fault when it's Valencia who then makes a haimes of it! You have to give the ball to your teammate in space, can't be taking the time to look up, see him, then think "Oh, that's Valencia. Won't pass to him".

2204~~~
Add to the fact he was playing as a left centre midfielder (LCM) so his passes to the left are bound to be short. Had he played as a right centre midfielder (RCM), I have no doubt he would have made those long diagonal balls to the left.

2205~~~
I'm concerned about Rooney's decline.  Once his finishing is completely shot (pun intended) I'm not sure there's left for him to contribute.

2206~~~
Who says his finishing is in decline? Just because he missed a couple against Palace...

2207~~~
Doesn't look comfortable in his new role. One of our most profilic scorers should be in scoring areas rather than in the middle covering for Fellaini, who has headed up to chest the ball.

2208~~~
Having Fellaini playing ahead of Rooney is scadulous. In fact, having to shunt Di Maria to the wing and Rooney into midfield, just to fit Fellaini in the team is utter madness.

2209~~~
I really, really (REALLY) want to see Rooney start up top for a couple of games for us. He's one of the best CFs in the PL and we're playing him in CM.

2210~~~
I do too. Then it allows us to move ADM back into the midfield or play Herrera there. Unfortunately I think RvP really hinders us at the moment.

2211~~~
This and it's not like we are seeing the massive benefits, offensively, of Fellaini's advanced position. I'd prefer to have Rooney occupying such roles with Blind, Di Maria and Herrera slicing teams open at will, Carrick is back so we'd put him somewhere there to provide a calming presence. If we had Carrick at Leicester there is no way we'd have thrown away a 3-1 lead in twenty eight minutes.

2212~~~

2213~~~
Yeah, Mata plays the ball out wide a lot as well, but never really gets criticized for it, because there's a perception of him as someone who plays through the middle. In contrast to Rooney, where it's constantly noticed and commented up on.

But here are Mata's passes from the last few games:

<b>Vs Palace:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s28.postimg.org/vcq2rqy4d/matapalace.jpg" src="http://s28.postimg.org/vcq2rqy4d/matapalace.jpg"/> 

Vs Chelsea:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s15.postimg.org/9eroh8dnf/matachels.jpg" src="http://s15.postimg.org/9eroh8dnf/matachels.jpg"/> 

Vs WBA:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s13.postimg.org/w2ltnj5tz/matawba.jpg" src="http://s13.postimg.org/w2ltnj5tz/matawba.jpg"/> 
</b>
Could it be that our No.10s and midfielders are being specifically instructed to get the ball out wide? Because Mata doesn't appear to be doing it any less than Rooney does.

2214~~~
I think so. In those games they've both been played out of position too.

2215~~~
I watched Rooney a fair bit on Saturday, and for me he was probably one of the main reasons RVP didn't get much service.  Rooney when in the hole behind RVP was slow to react and lay off a good ball.  He was frustrating at times as he only really passed sideways and not forward.  RVP didn't do much with ball when he had it but some of the runs he was making were very good. 
I think Rooney is not so much wasted in the #10 position he just isn't reallly good enough in that position.  His long passing is very good but his short, sharp and decisisive passing when surrounded by opposition is not good enough for this role - we have better at the club.
Would love to see him up top with either RVP or Falcao but I just can't see LvG doing this.
There has been a lot posted about players who dissapointed on Saturday but if Rooney could play the #10 properly, then RVP would have had a good few clear cut chances inside the area - something that we really failed to create.  He drifts has too much in this role, whether or not that is his instructions to do so, we won't know. Can't fault his workrate though.

2216~~~
I thought he should have been playing much higher up the pitch on Saturday, especially when it became clear Palace had no intention of coming out and playing. 

He was wasted just sitting in midfield, when RVP was basically in the box alone with 4 defenders half the time. 

Blind / Carrick / Fellaini were dictating just fine by themselves, so I was a little miffed why when we were struggling to make chances he didn't move him more forward.

2217~~~
That's because RVP is not getting into any good positions or making runs for our midfielders to play the ball through the middle or behind the opposition defence so they are forced to shift it wide.

2218~~~
That's the exact opposite to what Gary Neville thinks RE: RVP.

2219~~~
RVP seems very lethargic to me these days, not sure what everyone else's views are.

2220~~~
I think he's looked frustrated at times but overall I don't think he's been that bad. Apart from at the beginning of the season where he was clearly unfit.

2221~~~
Gary found a paltry three half-decent runs over 90 minutes. Two of would Pirlo himself would have found tricky enough to pick out.

If anything that piece on MNF confirmed what a lot of people on here have noticed. He's just not covering enough ground to play up top on his own.

2222~~~
Someone should start a thread to find out or something.

2223~~~
Also, when he plays on his own, he seems to be a million miles away from everyone else from some bizarre reason. (Okay, City we had 10-men, but then the same thing happened with the Palace game).

2224~~~
The problem he's having right now is that he's short on goalscoring form. And we've seen previously that it can take him a while to get it back.

2225~~~
Yup. All part of the same problem IMO. He can't or won't put in the hard yards anymore.

2226~~~
The most frustrating thing is seeing Di Maria putting in these fantastic crosses and Robin is not in the box or trying to get onto the end of them.

2227~~~

2228~~~
For Those Interested

2229~~~
Roo has been scuffing shots he would have nailed in his sleep five years ago. But he still has a few in his locker, such as his brilliant strike off the short Rafael cross recently.

"Decline" should not be confused with "crap".  The man can still play at a very high level, but he's undeniably in decline now.  Not a severe decline at all, but his gas tank got topped off about 4-5 years ago.

2230~~~
I just hope van Gaal stops this nonsense with the 4141 and 'balancing the side' and puts Rooney back where he needs to be; as close to the opposing goal as possible. He scores goals, and he makes goals. Simple. Even at his worst in 4-5 games as a #10/striker, he'll manage at least 2-3 goals with a few assists. That's what we need, especially when the team is in a bit of awkward phase.

2231~~~

Rooney is the youngest player to win his 100th cap for England.

2232~~~
Had a decent game tonight, so much better in the final 3rd as a forward than as a CM.

2233~~~
Funnily enough once he retires he'll most likely be the highest England goal scorer of all time and people will still say he's shite for England. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2234~~~
Some will still refuse to see him as a United legend as well...

OT - I think he's looked much better in the past few games, he's actually picking the ball up and running now. I've been watching some of our games when we had Ron/Roo/Tev and I think we could make something like that work with ADM and Falcao.

2235~~~
Not to mention England's most capped player.  Even if he has his annual cnut session he surely has cemented his place in both United and England history.  Just would have loved to see what he could have done if he had the same hunger as Ronaldo to be the best.

2236~~~
A lot of that is Mata and Rooney switching the play which is a big part of the way LvGs teams play. It's why Januzaj and Di Maria have been pinned out close to the touchline in recent games with the hope that they will receive the ball in space when the play is switched. Mata and Rooney will have pass maps that look like that because they do it more than any of our other players. It's one of the things I noticed when Mata came on vs Palace, he was immediately doing it and it must have been a direct instruction.

2237~~~
Just seen the BBC are debating whether he'd get into England's best ever XI. Most people are saying no but what do others think. He's played at a high level since he was a teenager so his stats are not surprising, but how do they compare with the other great English strikers?

2238~~~
That was good from Rooney yesterday. 0-1 down and a potentially mutinous crowd, he takes the initiative, strong dribble, wins the pen and buries it. Nice.

2239~~~
Suppose it's a tough one. He'd have a lot of competition, although England in recent times haven't had a striker who went down as good as the very best of all-time like Pele, Ronaldo etc. In recent times alone, he'd be up against Cole, Fowler, Owen and Shearer for example. Going further back he'd have competition in the likes of Lineker and Hurst, and then some would even go further back to someone like Dixie Dean. So he could arguably get into a team like that, although it wouldn't be easy for him at all.

2240~~~
I'd like to think in an England's greatest it wouldn't just be Rooney trying to make something happen and instead he'd be able to focus more on actually being a striker rather than a playmaker, so for that reason I'd put him in. If I'm being honest when I watch England there are only two players I actually see who I think could make something happen for themselves or others and that's Rooney and Sterling.

2241~~~
Going only by players i've seen play for England, i'd go with something like:

---------------Seaman-----------

Neville---Adams---Ferdinand-----Cole

----------------Robson----------------

------Gerrard-----------Gascoigne----

---------------Rooney-------------

-------Shearer----------Lineker

2242~~~
The
The funny thing is PES 2015 has him as a "Creative Playmaker"

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i1354.photobucket.com/albums/q690/42soundz/20141116_171033_zpsb9031b70.jpg" src="http://i1354.photobucket.com/albums/q690/42soundz/20141116_171033_zpsb9031b70.jpg"/>

2243~~~
PES also has Mata as a "tricky winger". Di Maria's a "dummy runner". 

Wtf?

2244~~~
It was a good performance from Rooney against Slovenia. This should prove that he's much better in the final third than he is deeper into midfield. Even if it was a garbage Slovenia team, he combined well with his teammates, made some very good runs, and, overall, looked dangerous in the final third.

I hope he doesn't play in central midfield again. I'd love it if he plays in the final third partnering a striker.

2245~~~
That's a fecking good side to be fair

2246~~~
For me, Owen has to be there. He's probably been England's best player from 98-05.

2247~~~
England's best and most influential player was Beckham, with and thanks to him at least they reached the quarters at the WC .. whereas nowadays ...

Owen was alright, too ...

2248~~~
Alex Netherton and Andi Thomas got <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/importance-wayne-rooneys-100-england-4642036" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stuck right into</a> Rooney in The Daily Mirror. Just some of the gems:

Might him playing as deep as an out and out midfielder in quite a few games this season have something to do with his reduced scoring rate? And indeed, is his rate actually much lower than his career average?

What's the implication here? That Rooney gets to choose where he plays? If so, I would guess that's utter nonsense. It's true he's played deeper this season, but at LvG's behest, rather than his own. LvG is on record as saying he thinks Rooney is multi-talented and that those talents are best utilized in a withdrawn role. Also, that he's been a 'disaster' is sheer hyperbole. He's usually been one of our better outfield players, as even some of his critics concede.

A cynic might say that. But so would an agenda driven idiot. Like playing at home to Everton, away to West Brom, and home to Chelsea is equivalent to playing away to the current league Champions with ten men.

This is the 'Rooney as Ali Dia' argument. That he's some sort of conman supreme, pulling the wool over the eyes of successive managers who've picked him, convincing them he's a really good player when he's actually not. Fergie, Hodgson, Moyes, LvG, Capello. All have fallen for it.

Won and scored the penalty to equalize in his last England game. Scored the winner in the one before that. Makes key contributions at vital times. But he's still as good as dead.

2249~~~

Barkley + McCarthy + Coleman + Stones for Rooney.....that would be my deal Kenwright

2250~~~
2 goals and from the bits Ive seen, looks a good performance

On target to be england and utds record goalscorer captaining both.

Not bad I guess

2251~~~
Two very nice finishes tonight, I really hope we start playing him nearer to goal, and stop all this playing him in midfield to accommodate Fellaini nonsense.

2252~~~
He looks as fit as I've ever seen him. His pace has certainly improved.

2253~~~

2254~~~
He's probably going to do something moronic on Saturday just to prove me wrong but the sending off seems to have changed his approach to captaincy. There has been a lot less of the cliché captain who just happens to be the loudest shouter on the pitch and more leading by example.

2255~~~
46 now I believe. Greaves down a notch. Next stop, cursed Ownero Goalth.

2256~~~
Enjoyed the game as a whole but Rooney looked up for it big time.

Plenty impressed with him up here in Scotland <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2257~~~
Seems to be getting right back into form now. Hopefully we actually play him as a striker this weekend.

2258~~~
Can we not play him in central midfield? Thanks van Gaal.

2259~~~
Good form going in to the Emirates at the weekend!

2260~~~
I'm not pleased when I don't see him anywhere near the opposition's box. There's a reason he's chasing down these records, because scoring goals is something he's really good at. More than that you can see how passionate he is when he does so. Don't know why managers think playing him deep is the best use of him. His instincts are for creating chances and dispatching them.

He's starting to look sharper at just the right time for us, and more mature as well. He's had a good international break and is coming back to us in good fitness. Now we need to unshackle him from midfield so he can produce the performances he's capable of.

2261~~~
He needs to play up top for United, he's potentially our best goalscorer

2262~~~
Ya if we eventually sort out our defense enough to play the diamond with him up front with Falcao it could be frightening.

2263~~~
Yet Van Gaal seemingly doesn't rate him as a striker <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

I would fooking love to see something like this one day...

-----Rooney ----- Falcao-----
------------Mata-------------
Di Maria---------------Herrera
----------Blind/Carrick----------
------Whoever's not injured-----
------------De Gea------------

2264~~~
And drop van Persie? Mwhahaha.

2265~~~
Keep it up for Arsenal Wayne too. You love to score vs them dont you. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2266~~~
World class player. Always has been, always will be. 

We'll need that type of performance on Saturday.

2267~~~
Maybe if De Gea becomes better as centerback, we can move Fellaini to fullback, and play Rooney as a striker.

2268~~~
I won't be frightened at all.

2269~~~
He was very good tonight and.......*prepares to be stoned*....I wish our forwards interchanged as fluidly as England's have in the last 2 games, popping up all over the front line.

2270~~~
That's because you're a big boy Colin.

2271~~~
Van Gaal out, Hodgson in!

I agree with you though, although to be fair England haven't exactly been against the best teams in the world.

2272~~~
That's not for Fellaini's benefit.

Good performance from Rooney tonight. In the second half he really showed what you want (and we haven't been getting) from a lone striker.

2273~~~
Hard to believe a lot of England fans wanted Wazza dropped for the WC when you look at what he's achieved for both club and country!

2274~~~
The club in question is why a lot of those England fans wanted/still want him dropped.

2275~~~

2277~~~
1 assist and 2 goals. Not bad for a aging fat and in decline striker.

2278~~~
Good performance from him. Had the right attitude, really looked up for the occasion. More of that at the weekend please!

2279~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Neither have we though, I mean our lack of creative variety against the likes of Crystal Palace and West Brom was very disappointing.

2280~~~
How did he assist?

2281~~~
Just watched the extended highlights of the England game. Rooney looked sharp. Good to see, hopefully we will see him up top for United!

2282~~~
Play him up top, he'll get you goals. It really is that simple.

2283~~~
Please the feck play him as a striker Van Gaal, enough of this CM shit.

2284~~~
Souness is such a bitter cnut. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wl8Olp6Df-E?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2285~~~
Rooney is best as a main striker.  The only time he is good as a 10 or support striker is when his partner is a poacher with pace like Chicharito or Saha.

2286~~~
Souness is a pundit I usually like but he is acting like an idiot here, just picking a fight with Carragher because Scotland lost the game, poor show from a guy of his experience.

2287~~~
A-fecking-men.

If Van Gaal picks Rooney in central midfield in Arsenal I'm going to be seriously irritated. Would almost be the tipping point in my belief in him as a manager. Rooney's always been a player who has hot streaks, seems to be hitting some form in front of goal, has a fantastic goal-scoring record against Arsenal and they're stricken by central defensive injuries. 

Would be beyond stupid to play him so far away from their goal.

2288~~~
On the currenent form, he's simply our best player (with De Gea)

But how can Van Gaal, who loves RVP so deeply, can bench his favorite against his former club ? If he didn't benched him earlier, he won't do this now.

Our only hope will be us playing in a traditionnal 4-2-3-1 with Wazza the higher possible and not playing like a 9,5 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 11 + 4. 

I just hope we can one day partner Carrick-Herrera-Di Maria in the midfield and Wazza upfront

2289~~~
Needs to play further up for us. Nice goals last night and we need something like that at the weekend and in future games. Sick of seeing him deeper in midfield and clearly it's not his best position.

2290~~~
Bitter but I think he is right in saying that Rooney should not be undroppable for England.

2291~~~
I don't see why we can't play him in an advanced role?

2292~~~
FIFA would not allow that team to be played

2293~~~
I'm not sure the opposition would be happy with that.

2294~~~
Because we're only allowed to field eleven players?

2295~~~
Van Persie so far has a decent record against Arsenal so I too would be loathe to dropping him. But we really ought to be playing Rooney who is our best player in his best position ongoing.

2296~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> So clearly change RVP for ADM, and ADM with Mata and remove Mata so it's Herrera ADM with Persie in front and Rooney up top

2297~~~
Why would you play van Persie as a #10 at the expense of Mata or even Herrera?

2298~~~
I'd play Mata personally over RVP, but think due to LVG loves of RVP, he will be played, couple with that the fact LVG doesn't seem to love Mata, and it's not too farfetched. I'd also never have Herrera as a 10 when we don't have a brilliant midfield, So Carrick holding, blind box to box, Herrera and ADM are the inside of the diamond, able to cut in with ADM as a play maker and RVP as a support striker, he's played a lot better further back recently.

2299~~~
Definately LVG should put Rooney up front. He's best there for us and also he's really got the bit between his teeth at the moment. He's work rate, positioning and movement is top notch at the moment. He'll cause all sorts of panic for the Arsenal defence....

2300~~~
Personally, I would just drop van Persie altogether, as the majority of his performances do not warrant a starting place. However, I agree that van Gaal will probably shoe-horn him into the team in some capacity, whether it's to the detriment of other players or not. It's not far-fetched, it's just illogical favouritism on LVG's part.

In the short-term, I think the 4-4-2 diamond should be our go-to formation, but even that is fallible. When we deployed that for a few games, I think we saw the best of our attacking football with a lot of fluidity and free-flowing play, but were more vulnerable defensively with that formation, due to the lack of defensive cover and protection Blind and the back five received. Since, we've been playing the 4-1-4-1, we've been a lot more compact and solid defensively, but it's greatly hindered our attacking game and namely di Maria who needs to be restored to a central position.

I think a lot of that is down to personnel however. If we were to play the diamond with Blind or Carrick as the pivot, di Maria and a strong, box-to-box midfielder on the left and right (albeit we don't have the latter, despite Fellaini acquitting himself quite well there), Herrera at #10 and Rooney a support striker to Falcao, I think we would see far greater balance between attacking and defending. That would provide us with a far better platform in midfield for Herrera to thrive in and I think his vision and creativity goes up a notch when he is more advanced (as he demonstrated against LA Galaxy) opposed misplacing many attempted through balls when he plays deep.

Mata and van Persie would be the odd men out, although the general consensus on the Caf seem to agree with that anyway.

2301~~~
Thought he played well last night, albeit against defenders from Hull, Blackburn and Norwich (i.e. 75% Championship standard). And it'll only take a loss on Saturday for the knives to be out again.

Definitely looks sharp though, and he was full of running last night. Has also started to skip past players again, which is a part of his game people have been lamenting the loss of for ages. Maybe a change in coaching methods is helping him in that regard?

Who knows, but we'll stand much more chance of beating Arsenal with a fit and fired up Wayne Rooney taking it to them.

2302~~~
So good! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2303~~~
Couldnt agree more. Would almost be the tipping point for me too.

2304~~~
Prepare yourself for RvP as the lone striker mate.

2305~~~
<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2306~~~
I don't mind RVP as the lone striker as long as Rooney is not as deep as he was at City and against Palace.

2307~~~
With the state of our midfield, he just might have to.

2308~~~
Assuming carrick is fit, we can play him, Hererra and Fellaini as a midfield three. feck it, I'd rather play Fletcher in there than play Rooney as a CM again. Complete and utter waste of one of the best strikers in the league, if not in Europe.

2309~~~
Rooney is a striker, and he is looking real sharp right now ... we need to freaking let him ravage Arsenal.

2310~~~
If Carrick will be fit and if Herrera will start, which he should, no reason to play Rooney in CM pos.

2311~~~
<span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua'"><span style="font-size: 15px">After the Palace game, Van Gaal stated that at half time, he told Rooney and Fellaini to play higher up. 

<i>‘I said at half-time to Rooney and Fellaini that you have to play higher up in support of Van Persie. I had to correct them.’</i>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2827850/Louis-van-Gaal-defends-tinkerman-tactics-Manchester-United-boss-seeks-balance.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...ics-Manchester-United-boss-seeks-balance.html</a>

Not sure I noticed much of a difference, but hopefully they do so against Arsenal. At least one of them should support Van Persie anyway - preferably Rooney. </span></span>

2312~~~
Exactly. Sadly I think we'll see Van Persie up top and Rooney in midfield with Fellaini, and if Carrick is out, Fletcher. <i>Shudders...</i>

2313~~~
With Mertesacker and Monreal there, or even Chambers, Rooney will ravage them if he plays upfront

2314~~~
They should revoke Souness' media positions. What an unobjective, bitter old arsehole.

2315~~~
Is it just me or does that seem like the most put on argument ever? I'm sure they're all being told what to say. Just looks so fake.

2316~~~
He definitely should be playing up top. He's better as a striker than some makeshift cm or a nine-and-a-half or something daft like that.

2317~~~
Both Rooney and RVP should start vs Arsenal. Rooney looks really sharp at the moment.

2318~~~
Is it me, or is he trying to dribble with the ball more often again? He made that run in the City game, a run in the England game which led to the pen and yesterday he picked the ball up on the left and almost scored after dancing his way into the box. I'm liking what I see from Rooney.

2319~~~
Yeah, he did seem to have an added burst of acceleration against Scotland. He was making the right decisions with the ball as well in terms of keeping it and laying it off to a teammate when needed.

2320~~~
He scores goals in bursts and has tendency to score for consecutive matches when he strikes goal scoring touch. Hope it continues vs Arsenal.

2321~~~
yup. pretty much agree that we need rooney further up the pitch. even in the expense of rvp or falcao now as rooney is in a very good form in front of goal at this moment.

2322~~~
Excited about his form. Hope he does the business against Arsenal. Will be a huge letdown if he doesn't.

2323~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e0CLybJU-5g?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2324~~~
His movement for that goal is so good. Starts off waiting for Lallana to stand it up to the far post but ends up completely un-marked for a tap-in at the near post. An under-rated aspect of his game which is wasted now he keeps playing so deep.

2325~~~
Really hard to argue that the diamond with Mata at the tip and Rooney and Falcao up front isn't the formation that best suits everyone at the moment, no?

2326~~~
I'd be happy with 433.

Front three of Rooney, Di Maria and Welb... feck... Mata?

2327~~~
Well yes, except that Di Maria was so much better in the diamond, and a 433 pushes either Rooney or Falcao out wide. The diamond is basically the same thing but with Di Maria pushed back into midfield where he is most comfortable, and Rooney and Falcao both able to play central.

EDIT: Feck, misread Januzaj as Falcao. I guess I'd just rather have the latter in this game, keep Januzaj as back-up for either Mata or Di Maria.

2328~~~
You didn't misread it. I edited it. And I've edited it again since!

My midfield three would be Carrick (fingers crossed) Hererra and Fellaini.

2329~~~
You monster.

Mata out wide? Even worse, surely?

This is what I mean about the diamond. Everyone is in their best position, and all the best players are involved. Ok, Januzaj misses out, but as 'the youngster' that's only natural if our senior forwards are all fit.

2330~~~
I just don't like Hererra and Di Maria together in central midfield. I know I'm in a minority on this but I just think they're both too loose with their passing. They're really creative so good to have one of them in there but both of them is too much of a risk. For me anyway.

2331~~~
LVG seems to agree with you anyway.

2332~~~
RVP's form is also improving with each game though, so it would still be hard to leave him out.  I hope to see both starting up top on Saturday evening myself.

2333~~~
I would rather have this team 

---------------------Carrick--------------------

------Herrera-----------------Di Maria------

Januzaj------------Rooney-------------- ????

2334~~~
I think they'd be fine in a 4-5-1 together. Problem before and why we were so open IMO was because we had 3 strikers in front of them, way too attacking. Having 2 wide players who will help out defensively would just make it all look better and more balanced. Herrera has a really good passing percentage so far, second only to blind I think, so I don't think hes too loose with passing necessarily. Just sometimes tries to force things in the attacking 3rd.

I still want to see something like this once this season:

Or put blind in for carrick, Rooney left and Falcao up top. Think it'd be fairly balanced and have plenty of creativity. People dislike Valencia but he helps make the right flank more solid and would make it more balanced with the others being more attack minded.

2335~~~
Absolutely. I would lean towards

Fellaini----Carrick----Herrera
----Rooney----Di Maria
--------RvP/Falcao

or

-------Carrick
Fellaini-------Herrera
------Di Maria
---Rooney---RvP/Falcao

2336~~~
Yep. Ancelotti <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/6517094/Carlo-Ancelotti-in-vintage-form-as-Chelsea-relish-Manchester-United-battle.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">called him</a> one of the most 'intelligent' strikers in the world, and he makes some really clever runs to create space for himself or others. But they don't look good in highlight reels, so it's not something he ever gets much praise for (although I bet his managers notice it).

2337~~~
Once again Ancelotti is right, his runs are generally excellent, perfect timing, perfect angle. I can't understand why he is not playing upfront alone, in a position he wants to play.

2338~~~
Definitely, especially with RVP not being in great form  it would also inject a bit more pace and movement in the final third which is something we are crying out for and we could bring Herrera into the midfield alongside Fellaini.

2339~~~
Would love him to play up front tomorrow but I just can't see anything than a lone RvP starting up top - which disappoints me, as he has done nothing to justify starting, let alone playing up top on his own.

2340~~~
Van Gaal simply must start playing Rooney in position. We've got one of the most powerful, prolific strikers in PL history stuck in CM, it's ridiculous.

2341~~~
Think he's the key tomorrow. If he has a good game, we'll win.

2342~~~
Time to drop RVP imo. 

That midfield is easily strong enough to not worry about it being over powered with Carrick holding and Fellaini bullying. There's more than enough technical ability to compensate for Fellaini too. Di Maria back central with permission to roam and Carrick, Herrera, Di Maria and Mata all competent passers of the ball. 

Which obviously leads us on to Rooney playing closer to goal and Mata playing closer to the striker. 

Surely that is our best option? Only (possibly major) problem could be that with Shaw possibly out we would need better cover on that left side.

2343~~~
I like that formation. Against Arsenal specifically though, I would have a target man like RvP given Arsenal's lack of physicality.

2344~~~
There's no formation that's worth playing RVP over Rooney for at the moment. Rooney is the man in much better form.

2345~~~
Rooney is just as physical as van Persie, anyway. The latter has the height advantage of course, but it's not like he ever exerts his physique in any way Rooney doesn't. I don't know why we're expecting anything other than van Persie upfront and Rooney in central midfield, though. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2346~~~
I like it. That is what I would go with.

2347~~~
Thinking about it more, it' a good team but probably not for Arsenal, they'll have Welbeck wide left forward and Alexis wide right.

2348~~~
With a newly reinvigorated Master Wayne at the helm, I say go for it!

2349~~~
An accomplished, controlled performance in central midfield, and then a top quality strikers finish to seal the three points. Still got it.

2350~~~
Two goals mid week and crucial goal today.I will say what every other united fan wants to say but is too scared "please dont get injured wayne"

2351~~~
<span style="font-size: 26px">C</span>aptain.

2352~~~
Great finish and played a big role in the second half. Held on well to the ball in the second half when we needed to hold on.

2353~~~
Superb finish and with his left fot as well.

2354~~~
Another very good performance in a big game.

2355~~~
He just *is* an outstanding footballer. That this isn't more widely recognised is an utter travesty.

2356~~~
I don't think he played well but I've no idea what the manger asked him to do so it's hard to tell. Another big match moment for him though.

2357~~~
Don't think he realised that we conceded.

2358~~~
What a fecking performance.

2359~~~
He's just a great footballer, but I think he'd be more effective up front.

RVP didn't do him any favours.

2360~~~
That was a captains performance, and what a beautiful finish.

2361~~~
Rooney looks ripped in the post match interview.

He is in that phase of form.

2362~~~
Did he just say well done to the defense for getting a clean sheet?  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2363~~~
Would've had an assist as well, if AdM - who is also obviously top class - had finished his chance.

2364~~~
If only he could do that link up stuff

2365~~~
Puts all the Rooney haters to shame once again.

2366~~~
Delivered when it counts. For all my disagreement with this LvG's decision, I'm getting really warm up to Rooney as a captain.

And, it's obvious that he and RvP don't get along well on the pitch.

2367~~~
No one can sit here and say Rooney doesn't work his absolute b******* off for the team. What a performance!

2368~~~
Did he even misplace a pass today?  But he really needs to play upfront.

2369~~~
Asked to do a shitty man marking job on Arteta and stuck to his task well, keeping his composure in the couple of instance when things flared up. Then got the chance to get more involved in attack and was crucial. I don't know how he's not second in the MOTM poll, excellent performance.

2370~~~
I think its time to play him up top in place of Rvp till falcao is fit. I liked the combination of him and Rooney in attack. We lacked that spark when rvp was on. And this comes from someone who has always said that Rvp was our best striker. But he's been crap of late. Rooney looks fitter and hungrier.

2371~~~
just brilliant, MoM if not for David de God.

2372~~~
This

2373~~~
Massive performance. I think we need to get Falcao ahead of him in place of Persie to really push the team on.

2374~~~
Whilst he's better upfront, right now, in big games, I'd play him in midfield. Does a job brilliantly.

2375~~~
Very good composure for his goal. He definitely looks like the best of our attacking options right now, even if there's more to come from him.

2376~~~
I think we need him up front, or very far forward, right now. RVP just isn't delivering, Falcao is injured and Wilson is too inexperienced to rely upon and not good enough to be our main striker at the moment. Rooney is our best option.

2377~~~
That's a good point however, today and against City he was our best midfielder. In big games, with our defence the way it is, I feel we need him in there.

I thought I heard him say that as well. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2378~~~
Really happy for him. And very impressed with his performance as captain today. Hustled in defence, helped out the team all afternoon long, didn't let silly or cynical fouls on him get to him, and didn't make any himself. And scored a wonderful goal. Great performance.

2379~~~
Had no doubt he would score that 1on1 against the keeper. He's still a bloody good player.

2380~~~
I think we need him more up front. He's done well in midfield at times, but it's ultimately not his position and not where we'll get the very best out of him, especially at the moment.

2381~~~
Thought it was a very mature performance

Played like a utd captain

2382~~~
Maybe it's just me but, I feel much more comfortable with him in there than anyone else right now.

2383~~~
I would love him to play up top. Was great today, worked his arse off and scored.

2384~~~
Mature preformance, very worthy of the captains band. Excelent finish too.

2385~~~
Our best striker by far. He's wasted deeper down the field.

I want to see him as the target man in 4-3-3 or 4-3-2-1 formation.

2386~~~
Same. I knew it was a goal, for certain.

Then again, I thought that about Di Maria's chance too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2387~~~
Loved the fact that he ran to our fans straight after the OG.

2388~~~
His work for the ADM chance was absolutely brilliant! It really deserved a goal.

2389~~~
I can see him going on a great run of form any time now.

2390~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2391~~~
He's basically brilliant at football. He's not a 10 or a 9. Somewhere in between. But he is fantastic.

2392~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2393~~~
Very controlled and mature performance where again he sacrificed his talents to play for the team, especially in 2nd half crowned by a fanatic goal.

Slowly growing into his role as captain:  needs to make it his team and exert his competitive spirit throughout the team.

personally a huge year for him, gaining club and national captaincy and about to break both scoring records.  I think once he gets past both landmarks, he'll kick on into a vintage final phase of his career.  Despite all of off the field issues we had with him, we are Lucky for us, it's been with us.

2394~~~
Love that! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

#banter

2395~~~
Is it weird if I say that in tonights form, he is easily the best #10 in the world? I can see why people want him up top, but his allround performance today was so fecking good, I really can't think of a player I would take over him.

2396~~~
Our most important player along with the keeper. Looks to have settled into the captaincy role now for club and country

2397~~~
He's playing well and loves scoring against Arsenal <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2398~~~
He was great today and has looked like our best player (bar De Gea) since coming back from suspension. I went off Rooney for a while a season or two ago with the Chelsea rumours and general average, or up and down form, but I think he's in a very good place right now as United and England captain and he is living up to it at the moment, long may it continue.

2399~~~
He was class today. Won us the game.

2400~~~
He seems to have that fire back in the belly again and he's some sight to watch when like that.

2401~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Brilliant!

2402~~~
Brilliant, absolutely brilliant! He loves to wind up Morgan.

2403~~~
This picture makes me laugh way more then it should

2404~~~
Can't question him after a game vs Arsenal. He never disappoints in this fixture.

2405~~~
Play him upfront. Simple.

2406~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What?! How?! 

I was shitting myself for those last 4 minutes. Can't believe someone on the pitch doesn't even realise what the feck is going on!

2407~~~
Random, but I bet Wazz is going to watch Bellew vs Cleverly tonight to support his fellow Evertonion.

2408~~~
Creepy

2409~~~
Can't be as creepy as you finding that picture you posted above funny. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2410~~~
Oh everyone knows I'm a weird bastard. Look at my location sure

2411~~~
Bloody hell. Well, if you found my post creepy, it must be pretty bad then. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2413~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2414~~~
He's remarkable and we don't always appreciate that. There's so much maturity in his game these days but he still is willing to sacrifice himself for the team wherever we play him. Doesn't always play as an out and out striker but his goalscoring is good enough to set records. While he's on a hot streak we need to keep him higher up the pitch.

2415~~~
I thought he said that! That whole interview was a cock up from start to finish as the presenter on sky said we had an experienced defence and that we had more possession of the ball.

2416~~~
How can you possibly watch that game and want him up top alone? He's doing half the midfields work.

2417~~~
The midfield won't have to do as much work with him up front because when the ball goes up there, something will happen, when it goes up to RVP, it just comes straight back.

2418~~~
Good performance by him. Good finish too.

2419~~~
Huge performance by him today.

2420~~~
Chipping the ball with your wrong foot isn't easy. Doing it at a vital moment at full speed against Arsenal after putting in a shift like he had, man that's brilliant. The man is a genius.

2421~~~
True. It's a great goal.

2422~~~
Yeah, that finish doesn't seem to be getting the praise it deserves. It was absolutely fantastic.

2423~~~
One of my favourite Utd goals in a little while. Went crazy when it went in!

2424~~~
Must be an absolute joy to play alongside him. And he almost always does the right thing in the final third (when he's not trying those chips). Hoping to see him as the main man up front soon, I'd be delighted to see a midfield of Carrick, Fellaini and Herrera behind Rooney, Di Maria and one other (preferably not RVP).

2425~~~
Me too. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2426~~~
Apart from hard work, Rooney offers nothing in the midfield role that Herrera, Di Maria or Mata doesn't. He's a striker for me, and he'll always be. I want him to spend all that energy of his on hassling defenses, running into space, creating goal scoring opportunities and being at the end of balls.

But that's just my opinion. I don't like seeing Rooney drop deep.

2427~~~
Rooney is brilliant at almost everything, but his very best is scoring goals and creating assists. He needs to be as far forward as he can to be doing that. Against Hull at home, in the form he is in, he could be bagging a few.

2428~~~
He was crap when he played striker at the start of the season, after being moved in midfield I can't remember him having a bad game. 

I am very impressed with him this season, not only his form, but how he conducts himself after being made captain.

2429~~~

Let's hope we have Mata in there then next time. Would be a sight to behold giving Wilshere free reign of CM because Mata tackles like a 13year old girl. Can't wait!

2431~~~
The white Pele.

And our best player.

2433~~~
I was one of his biggest critics as a 10 / midfielder at the start of the season.
But hes been brilliant in that role since playing there and hes getting better too so i'd be reluctant to move him.
Just think hes long overdue having a settled position in the team instead of being shunted around and i think leaving him will reward us more in the long run.

Can see the attraction obviously. Matas been pretty good (at least where goals are concerned anyway) 
and Van Persie hasn't really but i'd leave rooney in midfield personally.

2434~~~

I love his passion.

2435~~~
Glad he is starting to get the praise again. Some of the stick he was getting around the time of the Leicester game was crazy.

2436~~~
I've started to like him again this year. After the transfer request nonsense and the fallout with SAF Rooney just sort of diminished a little in my eyes. But he clearly has a lot of passion and seems to be doing a decent job as captain, hope he keeps it up.

2437~~~

2438~~~
I think it was more his reaction to it, when one of their goals went in he was screaming at the players more in a negative way rather than positive, glad he is on form though and he is settling into the role more now.

2439~~~
But they were using stuff like that to try and add weight to their argument on his performances.

2440~~~
Well, they're all gone now, so let's enjoy it while we can, eh? No doubt the haters will be back after one bad performance.

2441~~~
Probably after a poor first touch more like it.

2442~~~
Ah well, generally Wayne's bad touches and passes only come out when he's having a bad performance.

2443~~~
Ahh can't wait for those posts which usually include the bewilderment over not playing Mata over Rooney and ofcourse his wage packet.

2444~~~
Well I am in favour of Mata playing there but I want Rooney up front.

2445~~~
I find it hilarious how anyone even doubts Rooney's ability at this stage. All we ever hear is how RvP, Mata, Kagawa, Falcao etc should start over him, yet he's going to be Utd and England's record goalscorer and goals are only 50 percent of his game.

2446~~~
He's amazing. Yes, he's made mistakes but just thinking about what he's accomplished and the way he's stayed on the very top for all that time despite often having everyone against him (even the fans of his own team) just makes me respect him even more.

2447~~~
I love mata but when he was given his chances this season he didn't take them, Rooney has.

2448~~~
Really hate that argument of not 'taking his chances' during that 3 game period. We know what Mata can do, what he offers and what he doesn't offer. A 3 game test wasn't going to make or break his season.

If Mata played well in those games, Rooney would have come back in, van Gaal confirmed that by saying he can't drop Rooney, it looks as though RVP is in the same boat unfortunately and that really impacts on Mata. Over the course of the season, I think Mata will prove to have a good season for us, if not a very good season.

2449~~~
You are probably right, but one of my biggest issues with modern football is the constant refusal to drop out of form players, and it would be hypocritical of me to change my stance just because it's one of my favourite players. I can't bang on about rvp/Rooney never getting dropped yet expect mata to be an automatic starter, he had three games where one of his main roadblocks to the first team was removed and underwhelmed. I agree I think he will have a good season but he needs to make himself undroppable when the chance comes

2450~~~
Rooney has? His start to the season was horrible, he destroyed most of the attack we started. We lost 2-1, and then 1-1 and 0-0, with very low amount of chances created, so who cares that he runs a lot, he should create chances.

Rooney is improving now and I like what I see and of course he should play if he plays like this, but most of his games this season weren't good at all. 

Mata was good against Palace, he actually won it for us, but still didn't start and I am not even complaining about that, but it's obvious that it's not only about how someone performed.

2451~~~
I'm pretty sure those games Rooney played upfront? Since moving back he has been good

2452~~~
So when he's gonna fall out with Van Gaal?

2453~~~
Every week I thank Moyes for one thing....getting Rooney to stay at United and signed another contract. He's vital to us in more ways than one.

2454~~~
I am not in the "Move him up top" camp. His best position is as a #10. He may not be a techno midget who tiki taka's the shit out of the ball and nor is he as elegant as some of the others but he's one of the most effective players there.

2455~~~
Yes, because all the midfielders in a midfield 3 ought to be hard-hitting tacklers<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2456~~~
Because that's what I said..

2457~~~
Then why do you have a problem with playing Rooney up front, if all we miss is his tackling and hard work? Herrera is a much better all-rounder in midfield. Fellaini is better in the air. Pretty much everyone(Carrick, Blind, Herrera, Mata, Di Maria) are better at passing and keeping the ball.

With RVP being shite lately and Falcao still being injured, we sorely need an explosive striker who can cause the defense problems. Rooney is our man.

2458~~~
I'll never feel as conflicted about a player as I do about Rooney.

I really do hate him and love him at the same time.

2459~~~
loved his goal celebration yesterday.

2460~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I loved that over the summer, as if Rooney was this massive cnut that couldn't possibly get on with van Gaal. Not even a chance, just dead-on hated Rooney and was going to ship him out before he even met him.

2461~~~
Rooney should be number 9. We need goals

2462~~~
People calling for Rooney to be a no.9 are crazy; he hasn't played consistently in that position since 2009/10 (back when he was younger and more mobile too), what makes people think he'll just slot in and be brilliant? I know Van Persie isn't firing on all cylinders but at this stage he's still our best option up top, I still like Rooney has a second striker, or a number 10 depending on how Van Gaal wants us to play.

2463~~~
Also, I was crazy relieved when his chip went in to make it 2-0. I don't know why, but I've never felt confident in Wayne in 1v1 situations against the keeper. Honestly thought he was going to botch it.

2464~~~
I felt the exact same when he went one on one. Relief wasn't the word when I saw it drop in <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Oddly enough, I was absolutely 100% dead confident that Di Maria was going to score his one on one... and well, we all know how that one turned out!

2465~~~
Form.

2466~~~
Agree with you, although I feel that confidence is also a factor. Rooney had a defender close on him when he was through, so really he had to beat the keeper using a chip or maybe just slotting it away (showing great confidence), whereas Di Maria was completely un-pressured, and I reckon on another day, with a bit more confidence he would have rounded the keeper and slotted it.

2467~~~
They're not crazy, just right. Rooney has been an obvious #9 for two and a half seasons now. His play at #10 in a conventional system renders us predictable, while he has struggled when pressured in tight spaces. Rooney is one of the best strikers in Europe and that's exactly where he should be playing. Van Persie being a better option just simply isn't the case on current evidence.

To answer your question, I think Rooney would easily slot in up top because his finishing and work rate are the two best facets of his game. These qualities are exactly what we need from our centre forward given the other players in the team. He looks as fit as he has in years too, so mobility isn't an issue either.

Rooney's finishing really is massively underrated. I trust him in a one vs one more so than any other player in the squad.

2468~~~
If we were to ever press ahead with playing Mata in behind Rooney then we'd be golden in many matches, in my opinion. They aren't competing for the same spot in my eyes.

2469~~~
I mentioned Rooney being a second striker in the comment you replied to, and I think he'd be better suited in that position than both number 9 and a number 10. I agree that his finishing and work rate are both good, but he gets agitated when he goes for long periods of time without touching the ball or receiving it facing the goal. Not to mention that said work rate is much appreciated in the midfield when he drops back to help defend or drive the attack forward. Ideally, Falcao would be a great foil, but alas his injury woes and Van Gaal's preference for Van Persie haven't seen that come to light. I'm not doubting that Rooney could be a good-to-great #9, I just don't think it's as guaranteed a success as many people do.

But you may have a point on people's perception of his finishing. I've always maintained that Wayne is a good finisher, but for some reason I didn't feel confident when Di Maria slipped him the ball for the goal. Should have known better.

2470~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I'm the same.

I was confident of him in that one on one against Arsenal. I even knew he was gonna dink it up with his left.

2471~~~
It really was funny. If there was anyone on our team who all managers would love to have, it was Rooney because of everything he brings to a team.

2472~~~
Rooney is a tremendous finisher. I just knew he was gonna score as soon as he touched the ball. His finishing ability is underrated. He doesn't get into as many goal scoring positions because he has to drop deep nowadays but if his finishing wasn't good, no way he would be so high up the goal charts.

Coming back to the topic, Rooney has to play upfront. He kind of slows the game down and isn't very creative. Does the job decently but much much better as a #9.

2473~~~
Rooney and Falcao brings a lot of strength and physicality up top for us. Both are not slow but lack the blistering pace what can create uncertainty in teams. But would love to see this combo soon. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2474~~~
One-on-ones are actually when I feel more confident in Rooney. Some players you just can't trust in that situation - Saha was a prime example - but Rooney tends to score those chances.

2475~~~
What's with the fascination of fecking around with players who seem to be in excellent form in the position they are playing in? It was the same with Di Maria, so many people on here had a massive hard on to shift him out wide and his performances have massively suffered since then.

Its the same with Rooney now. If it's not broke...

2476~~~
<span style="font-size: 26px">#Rooney9</span>

2477~~~
He's been one of our most influental players for about a decade now, he's just not good himself but also makes team mates play better football, we are lucky to have him on our side.

2478~~~
I've been criticising him a lot as of late, but he's in great form and I'm glad he's proving me wrong. Took his goal well, and should of had an assist if di Maria had finished his chance.

2479~~~
Agree with those wanting him pushed up to no.9 position. His ability to run in behind/run the flanks is something we miss when he plays deeper. Would like to see him up top with Mata behind him, and maybe Wilson alongside.

2480~~~
He's the bet striker we have and we have him in midfield. We should be playing Mata or Herrera in midfield so Rooney can move up.

2481~~~
Nah, you'd have to bench van Persie for that and he's undroppable.

2482~~~
How many caftards voted in that poll that we should be glad he got banned for three games?

2483~~~
Fairly sure I was saying we should sell him the summer SAF left. As it turns out, that would have been a very stupid move on our part. Glad I'm not in charge.

The only striker we have who I'd be happy to rely on right now, which is a big worry given that we're supposed to have a star studded attack. Rooney will almost certainly hit one of his nightmarish poor runs of form at some point though so it's going to seriously hurt us if Falcao/RvP don't start contributing soon.

Still think Mata is a better #10 than Rooney and Rooney is better as a striker anyway, so you'd think our course of action here would be obvious....

2484~~~
Something like 23%? I bet they feel silly now.

2485~~~
Don't think he's looked this good in some time. He looks in pristine condition and regardless of where he's playing he's been effective. Should play upfront not because he can't play well behind the striker but because our other strikers have some problems.

2486~~~
To be fair he's brought every bit of it on himself. 

Captaincy, how he's handling it and his currently form may have refreshed his image from both club and country.

2487~~~
I remembered your post <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2488~~~
They never learn, when it comes to Rooney.

2489~~~
He brought a bit of it because of the contract shit sure, but the way people went on about it was ridiculous. So many on here started legitimately hating the guy because he was looking out for his own career pretty much. Should he have went public with the whole situation in 2010? Absolutely not, but so mayny people still hold grudges against him because of it. Rooney gets scrutinized as much as anyone, and despite everything he's done in his career for us, you see cries to drop him right after he has a few bad passes or something. He just needs to be given some slack sometimes by fans, I mean it won't change anything with him as he'll keep on performing great as he has done for most of his career, but fans are always just so keen to put him down that people forget how good he is when he's out for a bit.

2490~~~
Haha I did. More so because I was desperate to see Mata play in his best position. Plus Rooney rarely plays well vs Everton. Unfortunately Mata didn't step up.

2491~~~
His achievements for both his club career and what he helped us achieve were never in doubt, they're simply amazing but I think many fans like myself still will remember the contract situation when we review his career in years to come and lets not forget it was <span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>twice</b></span>.

2492~~~
The second time wasn't a contract or anything, it was just he went to Fergie to see if he could leave as Fergie didn't see him as a key player anymore, which for a player like Rooney, isn't what he wants. Never handed in a transfer request though, as he said and Fergie admitted later anyways. As for the first time, that's what I think is harsh. Yes it was wrong how he acted. Nobody is disputing that. It's a bit double standards that people always bring that up, but then nobody says anything with all the shit that went on with other legends like Rio, Cantona, Giggs and Keane. How is what Rooney did (asking to leave as the club wasn't showing ambition by selling Ronaldo and Tevez and signing Valencia, Owen, Obertan, Diouf, but in the end signing a new contract), and what Keane did (refusing to sign a new contract because of the rumours linking him with a move to Italy at the time I think, but eventually signing an improved contract? Do you hold that against him? If not, then you shouldn't hold it against Rooney.

Something so small and insignificant in the whole scheme of things shouldn't tarnish his reputation as a player who will end up as our all time leading goal scorer, one of our best players ever for all he's won with us and a United legend.

2493~~~
Rooney is that lucky anomaly - a Liverpool lad born to play for Manchester United.

He has always been a United-type player and the trashing of him over that silly red card shows what short memories some people have. Our Wayne fits in well with the tougher ideals of United - those do or die players such as Cantona and Keano, Brucie and Robson. The mistakes go with the territory, nothing venture, nothing gain.

It's enjoyable watching the United Captain and Chris Smalling getting on with it and making naysayers both here and from other sources eat their words. Wayne especially has the kind of character that we need in our captain and he just burns to take United back to the top. He is actually similar to Patrice Evra, too.

2494~~~
Those scenarios are completely different in the sense that none of them had the temerity to question the manager, the club and implicitly question the quality of the first team openly in a press conference.


It ultimately left many first team players unhappy and threatened to destabilize the entire team with all that negative attention. It was also blatantly disrespectful to his teammates and Fergie who had played a significant part in his development as a player and he probably never truly forgave him for it.

All the politics, wrangling and the negotiating tactics behind the scenes are understandable and part of the game. Just about most players do it as they have to look after their own interests. Rooney is a greedy little gobshite just like most players but he is an incredibly stupid one. I'm pretty sure that he didn't mean to be disrespectful to his teammates and just wanted his bumper contract but he was probably too thick to consider the repercussions of his actions <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. The alternative being that he really wanted to leave the club, which I don't believe in considering his abupt u-turn.

The second episode in which he fell out with Fergie, wanting to leave was understandable and could be excused to a certain extent as he wasn't an important player in Fergie's last season. 

I don't despise him or want him to fail but I just don't have the same affinity I had before 2010 when he was amongst my favourite players. Not that players would care about that so long as they get their salary. I did celebrate his goal against Arsenal though <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>. 

The vitriol against him can be exhausting and one doesn't really have to like him but it can't be that hard to just acknowledge that he is a good player. 

Its such a shame as he ultimately didn't really fulfil his frankly absurd potential and had that disastrous episode in 2010. For someone who is bound to become United's top scorer, I wonder how many would remember him fondly after he retires or how many would even include him in an all-time United Best XI <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>.

2495~~~
What I really like about him this season is how he has embraced the captaincy role. He's really trying to be a leader on the pitch by spurring the other players on and leading by example. Van Persie could do with taking a leaf out of his book because Rooney actually gives a feck.

I'll admit I was one who thought he shouldn't have been given a new contract and the captaincy, but he's really proving his naysayers wrong. Hopefully he continues his current form because we really need him to be banging in goals given RVP's shiteness and Falcao's constant injuries. If he had been sold, there really would have been no leaders in this current squad because if you look at the players we have, only Carrick and Fletcher have any sort of leadership qualities.

2496~~~
just come across this as was listening to this weeks podcast....smashing! 
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/O51P6EiahFx/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

2497~~~
Honest question: wasn't it Fergie that made it public first?

2498~~~
Have to say, not been a big fan of Rooney since he was toying to leave United. Made me highly, and maybe overly, critical of his performances and the effort he put in. Nobody can debate his talent, but always felt he was another Gazza, in that he was going to self destruct. I also thought Fergie was right in not having him play the striker role as he spent far too much time outside the box, sometimes in our half, and when we did a counter attack he wasn't where he should be. He always seemed to play the difficult ball rather than the more effective and simple pass.

That all said, since his suspension, he seems to have improved immensely. I see a lot more effective play, less stupidity and more maturity. Maybe, LVG has been guiding him to use his talent the best way. I also notice he isn't doing so much of control the ball and try and loft it to the wing. The ball is staying more on the ground and being played to feet.

I hope he continues as when he is on fire there are not many other players I would prefer to have in the team.

2499~~~
A man who's questioned the club's ambition in the transfer market, and threatened to leave unless he got an improved contract offer, could never really be considered a true United legend. Ahem:

<a class="username" data-user="65492, @NessunDorma" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65492/">@NessunDorma</a>

Cheers for those snippets. Were really informative. Still doesn't change the fact that Ferguson or Eric never openly questioned and disrespected United, his teammates and the manager. I've already said it my post that

You just have to look at the players' reactions and the manager's to realise how disrespectful it was and how much blatant negative attention it brought upon the club, which threatened to destabilize the team. As attested to by Vidic in the article in my earlier post. Many simply pass of the incident as something minute or similar to other players' situations when it was anything but that.

Wonder whether Fergie sympathised with poor Rooney's 'plight' in his biography. Do you have any excerpts or snippets of that episode from Fergie's biography that you'd like to post?

Make no mistake about it, Rooney is a good player and a legend of the club. Any player who is (soon to be) the top scorer of the club deserves that status.

Like I've said before, some let Rooney's shenanigans blind them and they become hell bent on discrediting him when he is a pretty good player.

The vitriol he gets is undeserved. There will be a significant number of fans who don't take to Rooney or won't remember him fondly after he retires, that's fair enough but it doesn't mean they have to go out of their way to criticise him. I can thus understand why many here get too defensive and go out of their way to defend him as well. It just leads to 2 annoying factions. One which rushes to lambast him after every misplaced pass or a shoddy first touch. The other which hypes him up to no end and get amazingly sensitive (not directed at you) at any single piece of criticism of Rooney.

It just makes this thread a rather unenjoyable one where you are either for or against Rooney and can't take any sort of middle ground.

2502~~~
I'm not too clear on the details but I think Fergie said Rooney had a injury and couldn't play, to keep the contract negotiations problems under the wraps. Rooney then said he didn't have any injuries or anything, which kind of forced Fergie"s hand into calling a press conference to clarify the situation.

2503~~~
Those paragraphs were published in a best selling autobiography in 1999, when Fergie was still very much our manager. How much more public do you want to get?

Besides which, I don't remember Rooney ever 'openly' questioning or disrespecting his manager or team mates. Quite the opposite, in fact. Here's the exact statement he made at the time:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/20/wayne-rooney-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/20/wayne-rooney-manchester-united</a>

So he said he had nothing but respect for United, thought Fergie was a genius, but was worried that the club wouldn't be able to bring in the world class players required to bolster 'the future squad' (i.e. not the squad at the time / his team mates) and remain competitive.

And given this was at the height of the Green and Gold campaign, he didn't say anything 60'000+ people weren't saying inside Old Trafford every other week.

2504~~~
I referred to his latest biography, not his 1999 one obviously... Fergie dealt with the problem behind doors and only revealed it in his biography years later when it couldn't affect the club negatively in any way.


Rooney did implicitly question the quality of the first team squad. You can't deny that. He obviously isn't going to come out and say aye the team is shite.

I'd like to think the likes of Fergie, Evra, Vidic and Fletcher weren't creating a fuss over nothing.



<b>

<b>

It was really saddening to see Fergie deliver that statement rather disappointed. After all this was the guy who'd let go of the likes of RVN, Beckham and Stam with relative ease without even looking back for a second. I was shocked to hear him say that the contract offer was still there for Rooney if he wanted it. I remember thinking he should have just asked Rooney to feck off.

However, Fergie couldn't do that with Rooney being the best player in the team.

Judging by Rooney's feckin comments you'd have thought we were languishing in mid table mediocrity and were struggling to challenge for anything when we actually lost the title by a single point and were unlucky in the Champions League quarter final exit. A few days later Rooney signs a bumper contract and voila, everything's fine and dandy for our Wayne. You'd never guess who we'd sign the next season, a promising young Spanish keeper, a promising young English centre back and Ashley feckin Young. Wonder whether Rooney was sobbing in the corner about the lack of top players he had to play with or was pleased with the league win, the CL final appearance and the huge salary he was earning week in week out...

2505~~~
Completely agree with <a class="username" data-user="90058, @Joga Bonito" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90058/">@Joga Bonito</a> 

I know we have had other players who used different tactics to get improved contracts or leave the club, fair enough.
But those players didn't openly question the quality of the team and that in a time when we were winning trophies. Keane dared to critizise his team mates and was shown the door within seconds as a result.

What made it worse was that Rooney's statement came just hours before our CL game. Seriously it can't get more shocking than that. 

Ronaldo at least just wanted to play in Spain, but even he didn't openly questioned his team mates' quality.

Since 2010 I don't have the same support towards Rooney. For United it's great when he performs as it benefits us. But for England since then I couldn't care less how he does for them whereas before 2010 I was mainly dissapointed because of him (and Becks until 2006) everytime England went out of a tournament.

Anyway, although I found both Ronaldo and Tevez more important at the time they were all here, I can acknowledge without problem that while they belong to other clubs now Rooney is still here. There are reasons for this as well (him being English, not intelligent enough to live abroad, not strong interest from top foreign clubs, high wages), but in the end all that counts is that he is here and mostly still performing.
Nevertheless it is extremely amusing how some ppl just don't want to admit the difference between his disgraceful actions in 2010 and other contract issues such as Keane's etc.

2506~~~
Not intelligent enough to live abroad <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2507~~~
ffs got scared seeing thread bumped..fearing injury! Thankfully it is usual shite about wage demands and transfer requests. Phewww

2508~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Well he is not the brightest or most adaptable person among footballers ...

2509~~~
Is there some list of smart and stupid football players in the PL?

2510~~~
Maybe you know about it, otherwise just opinions, eh?!

2511~~~
I only wonder how you got to have such an opinion, and it's hardly just you. A lot of folks thinks he's an idiot apparently.

I do not watch interviews, so maybe there was some interview where he left the impression of how stupid he is? Daily Mail investigated his school grades?


He did forgot about Arsenal's goal though.

2512~~~
Good one to judge <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2513~~~
Must be hard to hate Rooney knowing that he will go down in history as one of the greatest Manchester United players of all time.

2514~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BJRG88Ee2HA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Always thought he does have a decent left foot.

2515~~~
His first United goal vs. Fenerbahce was a sweet left-foot finish.

2516~~~
Don't let that stop ones from doing it. Highly entertaining.

2517~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He just insulted an entire country. And that''s totally wrong if Ribery can leave abroad every human being can.

2518~~~
So, what was keane doing when he did his tirade on MUTV in 06 which cost him his United career?

2519~~~
At least we know what kind of people hate Rooney now.

2520~~~
They never really have an excuse do they? Always personal attacks.

2521~~~
He should take a trip to the Costa Del Sol and spend some time with the English ex-pats that live there. Mensah candidates they ain't.

2522~~~
<span style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-family: 'verdana'"><span style="color: rgb(20, 20, 20)">
I don't see anyone defending it or trying to play it down? It was downright stupid and even worse than Rooney's antics. It rightly cost him his career if you ask me and I'm pretty sure that he did sully his reputation with that episode. However, I just disagreed with people comparing the Rooney's contract situation with the other players contract situations. Completely different imo.</span></span></span>

Aye. Think he should use it more often imo. I remember him saying that he didn't score enough goals with his left foot or his head and that he started to train on them. He then went on a headed goalscoring spree in 09/10. Scored around 10 headed goals or something by the end of the season if I'm not mistaken. Probably improved his left footed goals as well. He was just ridiculous that season and maybe even more important to that team than what Ronaldo was to the 07/08 one.

2523~~~
Its not different, Keano was questioning Fergie and the club. What about Ronaldo's slavery comments?

2524~~~
? How did I insult an entire country? With "him being English" I meant that as an Englishman he obviously prefers playing in England. That was totally unrelated to him not being the brightest. Nowhere have I said that Englishmen can't live abroad. Becks after all did well in different countries.

<a class="username" data-user="61812, @Mrs Smoker" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/61812/">@Mrs Smoker</a> Regarding your post it's just a feeling. Different things. SAF has also said Rooney wasn't the most adaptable player / could't learn new things easily. His interviews are also always the same "yeah we did well I thought" no matter what had been asked. Tevez is another one for example who I wouldn't call "bright".

RvP, Lahm, Hummels, Falcao on the other hand for example come across as extremely intelligent.

2525~~~
You misunderstood me. I said the Rooney's contract situation was different to the other players contract situations and disagreed with the post that claimed that they were similar.


Keane did disrespect the club, Fergie and his fellow players. Like I've said, it was easily worse than Rooney's antics and he deserved what was coming to him. Both Rooney's antics and Keane's were pretty shameful and if the original poster did acknowledge that, I would have wholeheartedly agreed with him. Instead he chose to compare Rooney's contract situation with other players' contract squabbles behind doors in an effort to downplay it and I didn't agree with that at all.

2526~~~
That's the problem with some ppl, just because some posters don't adore Rooney doesn't mean they hate him.

2527~~~
Its always the same people though.

2528~~~
Well that applies to almost every player. Do ppl who can't wait to criticize Kagawa or Mata automatically hate him? Or look at Herrera's thread, he has been here for 4 months and injured half of that period, but that doesn't stop some (albeit very few) posters to downplay everything he does. Still I wouldn't say those posters "hate" him ...

2529~~~
surely it's the boom part of Rooney's cycle at the moment where he's on good form, thus the haters normally drop away right now...

2530~~~
Great goal by him, and he is in great form, this is the Rooney I want to see.

2531~~~
Rooney's looking so sharp. What a finish too! That's why he should be played further up. He's such a threat.

2532~~~
I loved the finish. Instead of smashing it like most would from outside the box, he displayed great intelligence to outfox the keeper as well as finesse to curl it into the bottom corner.

2533~~~
Hope he's all right.

2534~~~
Nearly broke that board in two didn't he? Hope he's not majorly injured.

2535~~~
Same. Great game from Rooney today.

2536~~~
As I've said before, it's the one thing I do thank Moyes for...getting Rooney to stay and sign another contract. Regardless of anything, he's been and is a brilliant servant to this club and has dedicated his whole career to us.... and he is vital to us. LVG has managed him very well...he really is on fire at the moment

2537~~~
Yeah mate, my stream had commentary as well.

2538~~~
Him being on form going into Christmas/New Year fixtures is perfect for us.

2539~~~
Good finish, he's a striker, isn't he?

2540~~~
He really is leading by example at the moment, hope he can shake off any issues ahead of the midweek fixture and keep his goalscoring run going.

2541~~~
MOTM. He is in terrific form. Everything was great from him tonight.

2542~~~
Wasn't the board it was the bump in the turf before the drop, my guess is its only a bad dead leg but knowing us this season its probably his ACL <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2543~~~
I genuinely laugh at those who slated his ability a few months ago and wanted him gone.

fecking hell.

2544~~~
Me too. I enjoy every one of his good performances and remember all that bashing he had in this forum.

2545~~~
Captain Wayne!

2546~~~
Played very well today. Couldn't choose between him and Carrick for MOTM. Praying that knock he picked up at the end is nothing serious.

2547~~~
Credit to Moyes for not selling him off to Chelsea. What a disaster that would have been.

Please be okay!

2548~~~
It was utterly insane in the summer, the amount of grief he was getting. But it's always the same when England play in a major tournament. In the popular imagination, Rooney suddenly becomes the striking equivalent of Tony Hibbert.

2549~~~
In great form for us and is growing into his role as captain.

2550~~~
He'll be ready for the next game. he's a tough guy who doesn't get easily injured.

Great great performances this year, and he is growing into the leader role.

2551~~~
Why? He was in poor form and is someone we know has no problem holding the club to ransom/wanting to leave.

I wouldn't have a problem if he were sold.

2552~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This is just sad.

2553~~~
No player is bigger than the club.

Rooney's shit got old years ago.

2554~~~
Agreed, but getting rid of one of our best players when we're in the process of rebuilding isn't such a great idea either.

2555~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2556~~~
Holding the club to ransom? Where is the ransom note? Who did he kidnap? One of SAF's grandchildren?

Wait... are we talking about him negotiating a price for his services? Oh snap! Get over it already. How long ago was all this shit?

2557~~~
Great goal but what impressed me the most was how he was closing down opponents in their own half. Basically led to the rest of our attackers following suit and hence our ridiculous possession stats.

Concerned that he picked up a late knock? Hopefully its just a bruise and nothing serious.

We need him to keep up this form because it really feels like we are starting to gel as a team.

2558~~~
He's been mostly great since for club and country since coming back from suspension for that stupid red card, leading by example and getting close to his best days of years ago.

2559~~~
He negotiated the best deal from the Glazers...good for him.

Its nothing to do with Manchester United.

He works his guts out for the club.

First name on the teamsheet for me, if available.

2560~~~
I don't see what's so laughable about not liking Rooney. He's proven to have no allegiance to United. That in and of itself isn't a sticking point because there's very little loyalty left in footballers these days. It's the sub-standard performances relative to his status and wages that has really soured me on him.

I do think it's funny that the told you so brigade are now out in full force though.

2561~~~
That goal was sublime. World class finish.

2562~~~
Almost as funny as Rooney haters coming out of woodwork every time he has a bad game. But now they come out even when he's good it seems.

2563~~~
I'm "telling you so" for months now.

2564~~~
Mine didn't, it was on mute while I listened to the Wallabies England match, but it's good to know it takes no actual skill to be an NBC commentator <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2565~~~
Apparently he's fine, the knock isn't bad at all.  "Louis van Gaal has just confirmed Di Maria will miss the game against Stoke this Tuesday, however Wayne Rooney is available.

2566~~~
Another great game from him. So important he is for the team. Hopefully he will be fine and recover in time for Stoke game from that knock.

2567~~~
Well surely the ones who have supported Rooney through the tough times the club has had would be happy he's performing really well? That's to be expected right? A lot thought LVG and Rooney would clash due to a lot of made up shit about Rooney's personality, that has turned out to be false.

2568~~~
He will be ok, just a dead leg I'm sure.

2569~~~
Van Gaal confirms he's okay, Di Maria misses the Stoke game though.

2570~~~
Huh....he came here what...when he was 18 or 19....and he's probably going to finish his whole career with us...how is that proving no allegiance...sheesh...

2571~~~
I have no problem with people supporting Rooney as he remains a good player. But a month ago and for portions of the last few seasons there was a lot of resistance to the very notion that he was playing poorly when the evidence was clear to see. The idea of laughing at someone for holding a negative opinion of Rooney doesn't sit well with me for that reason.

I'm delighted he's playing well as it's good for the club and gives the fans a boost after what has been a very poor 15 months.

2572~~~
He is, and has always been a really good and really important player for this club.

It is a bit weird that some people seem determined to see a player who'll end his career as Manchester United and England's all time record scorer as anything but a brilliant servant and bona fide legend. But then people are werid. And often silly.

2573~~~
The reason why people laugh is because of the lengths that people went to to discredit Rooney and convince themselves he is heading for the door. Everyone knows that form is temporary but some were writing Rooney off as "done" and in irreparable decline. This is now known as complete bullshit, of course we can laugh at those posters. RVP should be sold, because he betrayed his club and left for Manchester Utd. Rooney has stayed, and actions are louder than words. He gets a big fat pay check, but please tell me, who is playing for free?

2574~~~
Do we get to laugh at Fergie too? I mean it was quite obvious he wanted him gone.

2575~~~
Another great captains performance from him. 100% effort as always and a really well taken goal.

2576~~~
You don't see what is funny about Manchester United fans disliking a player who will be our all time leading goalscorer, and a United legend? What would you say to someone if they said they disliked Cantona, Giggs, Scholes or something like that?

2577~~~
So it's weird and silly to question a player who obviously hasn't played anywhere near his best for a few seasons whilst still picking up a quarter of a million pounds a week? The amount of slack he gets is incredible. No point in pursuing this any longer as I'm probably in the minority here.

2578~~~
Fergie played his hand, he made it public which put pressure on Rooney to stay. I'm not going to pretend to know what is in his mind like you are, but in the end he was the manager and I can't remember Rooney being listed. Can you?

2579~~~
Every single player gets paid obscene amounts of money to kick a bag of wind around. Rooney got endless stick for 6 months about his pay packet. Most people have cooled down on that now, but here you are banging that same old drum.

2580~~~
Good again from him today, I liked the way he started in a free role from the left and Di Maria in a free role on the right, replace RvP as the #9 with Falcao and I think that trio could really fire.

2581~~~
This is a circular argument now. Have to give reasons for why I wouldn't have a problem if Rooney was sold. I still wouldn't tbh but I'm clearly not going to convince others on this.

2582~~~
Not much will be made of it, but it was an excellent finish. Both goals by RvP and him were great with different styles.

Huge performance again by him today, he's in great form.

2583~~~
Love Wazza. He's on fire at the mo, love it when he's like this. Hope it lasts

2584~~~
I think you spelled "stick" wrong? <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

2585~~~
Exactly, the amoung of stick he's been getting has been ridiculous, not slack...



Imagine player having bad pefromances while getting a big paycheck. Now that's a shock, isn't it. 


And yeah <a class="username" data-user="77836, @Woodenlung" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/77836/">@Woodenlung</a> - you are in the minority.

2586~~~
He's in form, the team is finding balance, when those things happen we will see him do spectacular things. Another really nice game from him today. Long may it last.

2587~~~
Really in a lovely run of form now, hopefully he doesn't pick up any injuries or bans to break it.

2588~~~
Hes a really old school, no-nonesense player. I like that a lot about him.

2589~~~
This is another argument that seems to be brought up time and again. Why is it that whenever Rooney hits top form it's always the "the first time he's done so for a few seasons"? Last season when he hit a purple patch and at times seemed to be carrying the fight on his own it was "the first time he'd played anywhere near his best for a few seasons", so are we now saying that he wasn't actually anywhere near his best last season?

The season of reference for his "best" form always seems to be 09/10 when he scored 34 goals leading the line. The season after this when we won the title and went to the CL final, with Rooney instrumental in the hole behind Hernandez, the press were waxing lyrical about his form during the run-in and it was no different on here. It was said then that it was the greatest form he had ever displayed and that the partnership with Hernandez had brought the very best out of him, combining his goalscoring exploits of the previous season with his creativity of old.

The season after he scored 34 goals - this time whilst not leading the line for the majority of the season. An indifferent season followed but a season blighted with injuries and positional changes and, in truth, a season that ended for us two months early after we had exited the cup competitions and romped the PL.

So I'm never really sure when this spell of a few seasons without hitting top form occurred.

2590~~~
Standard stuff, whenever he's in form people will try to find something to bash him for.

2591~~~
Playing well and looks like he's enjoying his football.

2592~~~
How? And if he has how have others proved that they do have "Allegiance" to Man United? I wonder what your definition of the word is anyway. Has he ever given less than 100 percent on a football pitch? Or does he not say enough cliches in interviews such as "biggest club in the world" etc etc ? 

Anyway, is it just me or this whole "purple patch" of Rooney just always happens when he is playing as a striker?

2593~~~
His touch atm is brilliant. May it long go on.

2594~~~
Brilliant. Continues to show why he's my favourite player at the club. What a world class finish as well, almost made it look like he's taking a penalty from the outside of the box the way he made the keeper guess.

2595~~~
Funny how Rooney is always + or - for United fans... The biggest compliment Rooney gets is from other players Ronaldo,Di Maria or anyone who has played with him tell the same story that he is fantastic..  I will go with that he must be right up there..
And ps fantastic performance by him today.

2596~~~
Criticism of Rooney's performances over the past couple of years has merit. For example, you say he hit a purple patch last year. When was that? I agree that Rooney scored some superb goals last season, Hull and West Ham away stand out. However, compared to the levels Rooney has hit in the past, last season was nothing to write home about. Many were genuinely surprised when they saw Rooney run with the ball past players at City. He simply has not been producing that kind of thing for awhile.

It is not unfair to say that in the last couple of seasons Rooney has not been as good as can be. What Rooney produced in 2012/13 and 2013/14 simply cannot be compared to what he produced in the seasons before. It is very difficult to identify many games over the past two years where Rooney has looked half as good as he did at the tail end of 2010/11. Even identifying moments where he matched his performance in the 3-3 at Chelsea in 2011/12 etc. would be hard.

That being said, at this moment in time I have no complaints about Rooney's form. He's been on an upward curve for a little while now. You saw it in the run I mentioned against City, and then in the one at Wembley against Slovenia that got England back into the game. The different elements of Rooney's game have come together again. Rooney touch is back, his ability to take people on is back, his decision making is back, his passing consistency is back, his shooting from range is back. In short, Rooney is now doing what fans should reasonably expect from him and he's doing it week after week. Long may it continue.

2597~~~
Interesting there was this video in pre season of LVG shouting at the players telling them to use placement rather than power. Every goal Rooney has scored so far for us this season has been with the inside of his foot except his overhead kick against Swansea.

2598~~~
Real captains performance today. When he is scoring consistently it really affects his whole demeanour. I understand this is normal for a striker, but it is never more evident than with Rooney. It stops him from getting involved in shitty little incidents and flare ups and it helps him be the captain that he can be. Long may it continue. Loved his reaction for RVP's goal too.

2599~~~
The answer is simple, never. 
Rooney is always delivering, when he is upfront he provides tons of goals and when he is not upfront he provides a lot of assists and goals.
The "problem" is that Rooney will always be disappointing for a month or two every year, which opens to undeserved bashing.

2600~~~
Tbh even since the 08/09 season he has refined his shooting technique and relies more on placement than raw power which the younger Rooney used to prefer. It has made him a more efficient and a deadly player imo.

He was on top form today and his work rate as always was there. His touch and his link up play were excellent as well. Hope he continues this rich vein of form. He should so long as he's utilized further forward instead of the midfield role.

2601~~~
That international break seems to have done him a world of good. He's got got 5 in 4 including the England games and he's actually playing well too.

Hope it continues for as long as possible.

2602~~~
Its all because of how he's gone about certain things that people will always look for fault because they feel strange from loving him when his love for the club was brought into question twice, which is fair in my opinion but that's for another thread.

As for now a lot of us questioned Rooney being made captain and we were skeptical of his captaining ability but credit too the man he has worked his bollox off to fill the role and each game looks more and more of a leader and more and more mature. In this form and being a credit and example for the team in his new role I'd easily say he's one of the most influential players in Europe at the moment.

2603~~~
Another good game from Wayne. Hopefully this form continues! Well taken goal too.

2604~~~
This illustrates my point about people forgetting form when it comes to Rooney. From mid-September to the beginning of December last season Rooney played 13 matches scoring 10 goals and providing 11 assists. If anything his form was probably better than we've seen in the same period this season.

Here he is displaying his ability to take the ball past players during that spell and in the Champions League later in the season. It was of course "the best he had played in years".

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zrw1SsX49Sk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2605~~~
It really is amazing the way Rooney seems to cause this weird amnesia amongst some fans. Every time he does anything decent it's as though people can only remember his debut season and the last game.

"<i>Good to see him dribble with the ball today, he hasn't done that in years"

"A long range goal. He hasn't scored one of those in years"

"A good run of form. Haven't seen that in years"</i>

The thing is, you hear these comments every year!

2606~~~
He's a magnificent son of a bitch. The haters can feck off to whichever hole they crawl out of when he has his occasional bad touch.

Lucky to have 10+ years of him playing for United.

2607~~~
Amen.....Despite the Millions spent, still the best player at the club and in my opinion best in the PL. The guy is the ultimate footballer. He does everything...pass, tackle, head, score. He'll be like Scholes and the other great players, we wont truly appreciate him until he's stop playing.

2608~~~
That is a big call to make.

2609~~~
Yep, who's better than him at what he does? Aguero and Hazard are unbelievable at present but they're playing in settled squads playing decent football. Also Rooney's contribution isn't just about scoring, its so much more than that......

2610~~~
I remember the stats, I also remember the performances. Quite a lot of those assists, as I recall, were set pieces too. They weren't brilliant pieces of inventiveness. That's not to say Rooney should be punished for taking good set pieces, my point is that compared to his previous standard Rooney massively dropped off. Are you genuinely trying to tell me that Rooney's performances were as good as the Champions League quarter finals at Stamford Bridge in 2011? Or West Ham away the same year?

Also isn't that second clip from the Olympiakos game which was long after December 2013? 

Only David de Gea played consistently well last year, Rooney has said that himself. Rooney has never pretended because he hit some great volleys last year that he had a sparkling season. He knows he is capable of more and he has actually been doing more on a more regular basis this year.

2611~~~
As ever, shit loads of revisionism with Rooney after a good / bad performance. A few points from me:

- Simmering negativity from some United fans is understandable after flirtations with City and Chelsea. That said, he's here for the long haul now, so best to get over it.

- He's in brilliant form at the moment, and seems to be revelling in captaincy. Fair play, as I was very critical after his West Ham red card. I'm warming to him massively as leader.

- The next person who says he's not the same as when he broke through is going to get a slap. No player ever is. The exuberance has been replaced by a colder, far more productive player.

- Not being on the same level as freaks like Ronaldo and Messi does not equate to failing to fulfil potential.

2612~~~
I tend to remember the shit things that he has done more than the quality touches and moments of brilliance.

2613~~~
I can understand why people forget Rooney's good form, actually. He was in top form at the start of last season, it gets forgotten cos the team as a whole were so shit and were dropping points everywhere under Moyes. When things truly capitulated, ie when it was obvious we weren't getting top four, Rooney's form nosedived which you can't really blame him for given that the season was finished. He was just as guilty as anyone of playing badly from January onwards, awful displays vs Bayern and Everton stand out in peoples minds more than, for example, at MOTM display in the otherwise dour 0-0 at OT with Chelsea.

Was in great form the year City first won the title too, the way we lost the league overshadows that a bit I think

When we won the league in 10/11 he was in astonishing form from Xmas onwards and we wouldn't have won that year without him. Before that he was in shit form because he played while injured at the World Cup and all that business of him getting caught with prossies again, and tried to force a transfer. That sticks in peoples minds more than, for example, when he dragged up near single handedly from 2-0 down to victory at Upton Park.

So you can see he's obviously struggled to maintain good form over a full season, so I can understand a degree of criticism, despite the aforementioned mitigating circumstances (injuries, negative stuff in the press, being the only senior outfield player pulling his weight under an incompetent manager)... Still cant deny its frustrating to me as someone with a naturally good long term memory when people say he's been below par for years and question his ability.

2614~~~
As you can see from my post above I'm a fan of Rooney but I don't think that's a fair comparison. Rooney tried to force a transfer at least once, none of those three ever did anything like that.

2615~~~
In a world of crap wrote on this forum, best post I've read for a ages. The negativity towards our own players never fails to amaze me. The sad thing like the quality players before him, we'll only fully appreciate his quality when he's no longer here. For example, I have to laugh when people were talking about selling Giggs.....the myopia of forums!!!

2616~~~
I hope he's going to be alright for the Stoke match. It seems like when he plays it gives a real lift.

2617~~~
I have to say Rooney has impressed me recently. I criticized rooney alot mainly because while he is a great productive player, he wasn very consistent in his overall play which I think is important in establishing and maintaining the team's rhythm in possession.  However, more recently, he's shown a more consistent touch, quicker decision making, better positioning and so on and so forth. 

I think some of his criticisms had merit but if you look at the stats too generally, you'll miss it.

2618~~~
Rooney's finishing is genuinely incredible. It still doesn't get the credit it deserves, because the reality is that - Messi and Ronaldo aside - it's as good as any centre forward we've seen in the last decade or so. His goal tally is testament to that.

I'm enjoying his all round game a lot more this season, too. Much sharper and tighter. One of our best players this season, certainly.

2619~~~
Giggs did something a lot worse but okay, wasn't football related. Keane had his contract issues and looked to leave before, cantona was suspended for a while because he kicked a fan, etc..

I'm not saying what rooney did was right, but that it's so small and insignificant in the grand scheme of things that people go way overboard with the criticism and hate just because of 1 contract situation.

2620~~~
There's probably only one other player that instantly comes to mind who I think is destined to score any one on one he gets and that is Aguero. After him, I'd say Wayne is probably the best around.

2621~~~
Ever thought that the team as a whole had declined since then - with some key players ageing or retiring -  and Rooney's performances had to be seen in that context?

It might not be coincidence that, since we've gone out and replenished the squad with genuine attacking quality - the Matas, the Di Marias, the Falcaos - all of a sudden he's looking very good again (not that he looked particularly bad last season or in 2012/13).

2622~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2623~~~
Any news on his injury? Hopefully he isn't out. Especially with Di Maria out, we need him fit and firing for Tuesday.

2624~~~
Van Gaal says he hopes to have him fit for Stoke.

2625~~~
Aye, true about Giggs, so to answer your previous question, I wouldn't really find it that odd if a United fan didn't like Giggs because of what he did. I sometimes don't look at him the same way anymore.

I'd argue that it was more than just a contract situation, Rio had one of those like Keane did and it was quickly forgotten about. Rooney publicly slated the clubs lack of ambition and was seemingly flirting with City. Personally it seems the guy was being genuine when he apologised and said he realised he fecked up massively, others would be perfectly entitled to disagree and think he's just a greedy sod. You have to admit too, when he plays badly he's really really bad, which I don't think you could accuse those 3 of.

2626~~~
Great, thanks!

2627~~~
With Giggs its weird, I normally just see him as a legend and completely forget about what he did, but then as a human being he's probably a complete scum bag to do what he did, and that really puts a downer on his reputation. Case of love him as a player, but wouldn't want him to be our manager and part of the reason for that is what he did.

With Rooney, yes he did slate the clubs lack of ambition, though he said that to Fergie, and then Fergie said it in the interview, no? Don't think he came out and said we're lacking ambition in public. When you look at the transfer window the year before and that year though, it would probably be a natural fear (sold Ronaldo, let Tevez go, signed Valencia, Obertan, Bebe, Hernandez (bargain of course), Owen, etc..). We basically brought in a lot of money from transfers and hardly put anything back into the club, which would be worrying for anyone.

And I always found it harsh for people to say he flirted with City or whatever. All there was, was made up stories about City wanting to sign him in January, I doubt he would have ever gone there. I think he was more looking to go abroad when he wanted to go, the stories about City were never going to happen IMO.

2628~~~
He wasn't always that good a finisher but I think he turned a corner in that monster 09/10 season and hasn't looked back. I agree that if we played him as the lone striker with a Di Maria- Carrick- Herrera midfield behind him and wide players with genuine pace and flair flanking him he would surpass his previous best, easily. Which makes me think that one of our biggest challenges in the next six months is us streamlining our forward line up so that we can play our best players in their natural positions, can be able to field a lone striker formation and still have enough games to develop Wilson, Januzaj and Keane.

2629~~~
So if he doesn't make the Stoke match (even though it is more likely he will) who replaces him in the team? He would be a big loss.

2630~~~
Falcao is half-decent as understudies go.

2631~~~
I'm not sure he would be fit enough to start though.

2632~~~
With regard to his finishing, I'm sure I read an interview with him before where he basically credits the evolution of his finishing prowess to Ole. Learning when to give the eyes and go near post, give it the dink etc. I can't stand the man but I have nothing but praise and admiration for his effort, willingness to learn and end product as a result of that. His footballing character is unquestionable.

2633~~~
At the beginning it looked like the captaincy had a negative impact on him but now, he revels in it and is doing a good job as captain

2634~~~
I think the issue with Rooney, is that the difference between his good and bad games are very obvious.

As Schmikes said of Scholes, all players have their good and bad games. The thing about Scholes is that his bottom level is so high, that on his off day, the teammates would just feel that he's having an off game, but it won't go noticed by the spectators.

Coming back to Rooney, when he's having a bad game, he's very bad. His first touch is heavy, doesn't get pass any players, passes gone awry, always in the wrong place due to him falling back to midfield in an attempt to get more involved and generally reduced to hopeful long shots that doesn't find the target. In general, being painful and frustrating to watch. And there are times where he could go two or three matches in a row having a bad game like that. Him being one of the best (and therefore most closely watched) players at the club, having off games like is very memorable.

The other factor being that his time at United coincides with the rise of Ronaldo. Both players come to United at almost the same time with "wonderkid" reputations; one went on to be an absolute monster, and Rooney went on to became a very good player, though not quite World Class. So when people compared the two, Rooney always seemed like he failed to lived up to his potential. 

And of course, twice being publicly unhappy doesn't quite endear him to us - the 1st time when we weren't showing enough ambitions by signing enough top footballers, then 2nd time when we were indeed signing top footballers, just that they play in his position.

2635~~~
I still think an in form Rooney is the best player we have (bar an in form Di Maria, of course), f*ck the haters.

2636~~~
The problem is with how long does that period last.

2637~~~
Usually very long given his stats for us over his career here.

2638~~~
Di Maria rates him anyway:

2639~~~
People act as if he has a couple of good games every now and then followed by lots of mediocrity. The fact is he's had a very good level consistently for a decade (with ups and downs), which is pretty rare in football. I also think a bit too much is made of his 'bottom level', even when he's not performing he usually manages to contribute to the team.

2640~~~
I think pretty much everyone in football does. Regardless of who is in our team it's always Rooney that opposing managers and players say they fear facing. It's only really certain fans who seem to not rate him, despite him being our most consistent performer since Ronaldo departed.

2641~~~
Most players who play with him rate him, he must be a fantastic teammate to have. Very selfless.

Really enjoy the partnership forming with Di Maria I have to admit, they definitely seem to be on the same wavelength.

2642~~~
Tbh, he was considered to be just behind Messi and Ronaldo (potential wise or otherwise). Over the years, quite a few players have surpassed him. "Those are not my facts. Those are facts of Wayne Rooney."

2643~~~
This. The gulf between a Rooney in form and a Rooney off his game is absoloutley massive. His bottom level is truly horrendous while he is world class when on form. Sure there might be some kneejerk reactions here and there, but i think there are a couple of factors one need to consider.

- His massive wages
- His flirting with other clubs
- Him being one of, in not THE "star player"
- When he does have bad games, he stinks
- Fotballfans in general being spastics with very short memories

2644~~~
I said a while back that Di Maria is our new Ronaldo. And I didn't just mean that in the sense of him being an indisputably world-class player who can score and create with the best of them. It's also because, at this early stage, he's linking up with Wayne Rooney on the counter-attack every bit as well as Ronaldo used to. The Arsenal game is the prime example (Di Maria releasing Rooney to score, Rooney releasing Di Maria to get a 1 on 1), but there have been a few other examples as well. The two of them together are a potent threat, and Rooney is showing he can still do it at that advanced level.

The main thing I take from this, though, is sadness. Because Rooney and Ronaldo through 2009-2014 could've - no, *would've* - been spectacular. And we never got to see it, even if his link ups with Valencia and Young were also quite good.

2645~~~
Hererra's first goal for United.

2646~~~
has there been any news about Rooney having an injury?

he is showing as a doubt with only 75% chance of playing tonight on fantasy footy website

2647~~~
Hobbled off the pitch after colliding with an advertising hording in injury time (ironically). After the match Van Gaal said Rooney told him he'd be fine to start tonight.

2648~~~
And continued with ''but he always says that''. 

I'm honestly not sure if he'll start which would be a massive blow.

2649~~~
I didnt realise that - he is in one of those rich streaks of form so I hope he is ok

Now the important question is whether I go ahead and buy him for my fantasy team

2650~~~
It was an impact injury. Do you really think Wayne Rooney will drop out of a match-day squad because he's got some bruises?

2651~~~
Yep, Rooney will be fine. He had a dead leg at most unless he hit his knee and twisted it when landing. I would be very surprised if he doesn't start.

2652~~~
Rooney will play. Rooney will score. Rooney will conquer.

2653~~~
Based on this comment Ive bought him for my team - Im holding you directly responsible if he doesnt play

2654~~~
I brought in Falcao. Its a high risk strategy but quite frankly Im doing so badly I need to do something dramatic to either make or break my season.

2655~~~
Lusi, Ici, Vinci

2656~~~
BBC have mentioned that LvG has said that Rooney is out injured. So whats that 42 injuries this season already?

2657~~~
D'oh!

2658~~~
We'll miss him, as we do everytime he isnt available.

2659~~~
To quote myself

2660~~~
Any news on the injury?

2661~~~
He will be a big miss. Hope he isn't out for long.

2662~~~
Disappointed he's out, not getting the luck of the draw at all with our injuries.

2663~~~
FFS! <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2664~~~
Feck sake, please not be out for more than tonight.

2665~~~
Hope it's just a precaution considering Rooney thought he was fine after the Hull game. 

Feels like we see this almost every season with him. He has a purple patch and he's our best player ever. Then he gets injured, takes too long to get his touch back and is labelled a pub player.

2666~~~
I guess it's simply precautionary to avoid being out for much longer than just the Stoke match.

2667~~~
When this guy hangs his boots up you'll miss him.

2668~~~
Did LVG say anything about Rooney? I heard on social media he was having a scan.. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2669~~~
Fingers crossed he's back for Southampton, which is thankfully on a Monday. If we continue with a diamond, there's no other striker we've got like Rooney who drops off into pockets and links up with the midfielders.

2670~~~
Still our best player. Di Maria can be be but at this point it is still Rooney and very obviously so.

2671~~~

Trained today, definitely back on Monday.

2677~~~
Just saw this stat:
Aguero since signing for city 2011 56 goals and 23 assists in 93 games
Rooney same period 59 goals and 32 assists in 96 games

2678~~~
I do like the look of that stat!

Presumably that's appearances, rather than starts, right? I'd imagine Rooney's notched up a lot more minutes in those games?

2679~~~
Hold on. They seem to be completely wrong! 

Wiki has Aguero down as scoring 94 in 141. So I'm calling bullshit on your stats...

2680~~~
For city Wiki has him at 66 in 101.

Edit: in premier league

2681~~~
In the league only. 94 in 141 overall.

Either way, it's not fecking 56 in 93!

Which has me irritated, because I immediately posted that stat on another website I post on where Aguero was being discussed. Feck it anyway.

2682~~~
It's an old stats, someone posted it this summer.

2683~~~
Yeah being discussed in another thread.

It looks as though Rooney still does pretty well with the latest update, mind you.

2684~~~
Ok, league stats only.

Rooney has 61 goals and 26 assists in 91 appearances (8226 minutes)
Aguero has 66 goals and 19 assists in 85 appearances (7179 minutes)

Now, which player has been playing for a team that is more likely to create chances in any given game over that period of time? (I think we all know it ain't Wayne Rooney!)

<a class="username" data-user="38697, @Treble" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38697/">@Treble</a>, still think Rooney peaked two years before any of these stats were collected?

2685~~~
Two of the best forwards in the world have similar stats.

Well, I, for one, am shocked.

2686~~~
For both it's amazing, but Aguero is a beast, he just delivers.

2687~~~
Rooney is supposed to be a great #10 and an average striker. And not world class.

2688~~~
Says who, exactly?

2689~~~
The bloke I @'d in my edit. He wanted me to name any recent season where Rooney could be considered world class. The implication being that he's nothing of the sort. Turns out that he's been more or less keeping pace with a striker currently being talked up as the very best striker on the planet, while playing for a team that created considerably fewer goals overall than the team Aguero was playing for.

2690~~~
Yet, its apparently outrageous to suggest that I prefer Rooney to Henry in a prem all time XI.

2691~~~
I wouldn't mind him, he's notoriously negative.

Not sure about 'world-class', it's not a term I particularly like as it can have so many different meanings from person to person, but I still think Rooney's one of the best forwards in the game, yes. Obviously if you discount the big two, he's maybe a level below Aguero, Ibra, and Suarez right now and of a similar standard to Lewandowski and Costa.

2692~~~
There was a poll and a discussion about this, if i'm not mistaken.

2693~~~
Yeah, it's a meaningless phrase. Just boils my piss that so many United fans try so hard to downplay Rooney's quality, while talking up Manchester City's main man (go figure).

The only way you can cut through those agendas is with the sort of stats I've just posted. Which are fairly fecking conclusive.

EDIT: Just so we're clear, I think Aguero is probably the better striker right now, assuming he can buck the trend of previous seasons and avoid recurrent injuries for the rest of this season.

2694~~~
Astounds me how good Rooney's stats are. Particularly when you consider how deep he has been deployed at times. A very underrated finisher.

2695~~~
Why are people comparing Rooney and Aguero? Its quite clear whose the better player at this present time.

2696~~~
Thanks for the piercing insight.

They're being compared over their careers to date.

2697~~~
I'd imagine many of those games for Aguero he played far less minutes than Rooney. Aguero being the all time minutes per goal leader.

EDIT: Doesn't take anything away from Rooney though top class player of course and seems back to his best these days

2698~~~
Pretty amazing tbh, especially given that a third of those appearances came in last year's car crash of a season.

2699~~~
Yup. Not to mention that Aguero was playing for a team that scored 100+ goals at the same time.

2700~~~
In that 100+ goal season Augero was mainly injured (he played 23 league games many as sub) and in the previous 2 seasons before that I think we outscored city.
Actually they outscored us 11/12 by 4 goals and we outscored them the following season by 20 goals.

2701~~~
They've scored 30 league goals more than us, overall, since Aguero signed for them.

2702~~~
Yes mainly due to last season (we being SHITE) where I'm pointing out that Augero has many injuries. He was outscoring Rooney minutes per goal comfortably before last season.

2703~~~
He's outscoring him minutes per goal overall.

Doesn't make my point any less valid that he has - generally - been playing for a team that was better at creating goals. 27 (Rooney) to 20 (Aguero) appearances last season, for the record.

On the minutes per goal, thing, it's all well and good but I still think a player's ability to play as many games as possible should be taken into account when deciding who's the more useful to his team (i.e. better). One of the things we'll miss most about Evra (and still most about Ronaldo) is the ability to consistently play 30+ league games/season. That's a fantastic quality in any player IMO.

2704~~~
The point I am making it that City outscored us last season by 40 goals because we were dog shite.
Overall they havent been better at creating chances than us if you take our freak season last year out of the picture.
I've already said about appearances last season 20 yes many of which he didn't make 90 mins.

Anyway its a moot point, Rooney is a top class striker, I actually think its his best position not this no10 nonsense.

2705~~~
Why take it out of the picture? We're only comparing three and a half seasons in total. You can't just ignore one because it was a freak. Aguero might have been injured a lot in that season but he still managed to equal Rooney's goal tally, which he wouldn't have done if City weren't scoring for fun (plus Rooney's overall tally would be improved if we weren't so shite)

On a side note, looking back through league tables where we finished on top, comfortably out-scoring City, has made me slightly depressed <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2706~~~
And if he was upfront all the time.

2707~~~
I don't think you can say that for a fact is my point. He is a brilliant finisher and scored goals even when City were not scoring for fun

EDIT: For instance he scored 6 in 6 in the UCL last season City were not scoring for fun, infact we outscored them in the UCL and Rooney got 2 in 9?

2708~~~

New boots ready for Southampton. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2709~~~
Those stats about Aguero & Rooney are interesting. For a team player who is regularly being moved around position wise, Rooney has a great record. Always boggles my mind how quick fans on here are to turn on him when he has a bad performance, and the oft repeated "boots to Valencia on right wing" thing happens. A lot of those people will only truly miss him when he's gone, and realise what we have in him. A fantastic player. Should always be on our team sheet when fit (bar League Cup games). People who were happy he was banned are nuts.

2710~~~
In the same time, Aguero has another 26 goals in other comps, and Rooney has 13.

2711~~~
Hope he doesn't show any rust on Monday. With Fellaini seemingly out, we need Wayne at his best. If he plays well, we'll win.

2712~~~
For me, the point isn't the direct comparison. The point is that people on here speak about Rooney as if he's terrible. They want him dropped, they want him benched, they want him sold in some cases. People blame him for average players like Welbeck & Kagawa not progressing, and being marginalised. When those stats show he is not far off Aguero, who is being discussed as the greatest striker in the world at the moment. Yeah, he's not quite as good as Aguero. But he's a fantastic player, and on his way to being a legend of the club.

2713~~~
He's been out, he'll be rusty. Nothing we can do or say to change that, he always is. Never known anyone to be that bad when it comes to missing games.

We'll need him for the games after it so as long as his injury has healed it won't truly matter.

2714~~~
There'll have been a 9 day gap between Monday and his last game. And I bet he's missed a couple of days training at the most. Rustiness shouldn't be an issue.

2715~~~
The way some of you are talking, you'd think Rooney has been out for a month or two. He's missed one game, which fell in the same week Rooney played against Hull. Had we not had two games in four days, we would have played one game this week, which is what we've been doing since the start of the season.

2716~~~
Rooney will be fine. It's some of the other forwards you need to be fretting about...

2717~~~
We say this every time and yet no matter how small an amount of time he misses, he's always, without fail, dogshit against his next opponent.

Don't get me wrong, we've got so many games coming up that he'll be vital but in this first one, he's gonna be a liability.

2718~~~
Missed three games through suspension not long ago - and was then our second best player in his comeback match against City <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/829576/LiveStatistics/England-Premier-League-2014-2015-Manchester-City-Manchester-United" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">according to</a> WhoScored's rating system, which is based on measurable contributions.

Seriously, he's had a two day lay-off at most. If he's shit, it likely won't be because of any injury.

2719~~~
This

2720~~~
I did fear that after the suspension he might come back needing time but, he's played at a very high level and don't doubt he'll be itching to do so on Monday. Hope he is the difference in getting us to play with a little more aggression / pace.

2721~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/KuCr4VU.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/KuCr4VU.jpg"/>

2722~~~
Rooney has played like 1,000 minutes more and takes corners and frees. Still impressive though obviously.

2723~~~
To be fair, Aguero's been injured a lot. There's been quite a few times where he's been subbed off early or subbed on late, whereas Rooney pretty much starts and finishes every game.

Also those stats are old.

2724~~~
Doesn't matter, still impressive.

2725~~~
It's just proof that Rooney is on that sort of level, whilst obviously not being as good as Aguero. It's true Rooney takes set pieces (not sure why that is an issue, though) and has more minutes, but Man City have scored more goals altogether in that time period, and playing better football.

2726~~~
Sure is, another good point to mention is that Rooney's been playing behind the striker most of the time.

2727~~~
It's not an issue, I only mentioned it as it's obvious he is going to have more assists when he's taking corners. Although obviously it's in Rooney's favor that he can deliver a great set piece, which is something Aguero doesn't have in his locker.

2728~~~
Confuses me when people say this. I mean, surely his corners and free kicks have to be good enough in order to reach his desired target. Yes, Aguero obviously doesn't take free kicks and corners, but that's because he's not good enough, otherwise he would. 

Look at Di Maria. The start of the season he took corners from the right side and was pretty poor, hitting the first man almost every time. Van Gaal has now gone back to Van Persie taking the corners.

2729~~~
Rooney is judged far more than any other player in the Utd squad...but what pleases me is he is comparable to any player in the league, no excuses necessary.

2730~~~
Aguero always takes the pen if he's on the pitch, whereas Rooney has had to battle VP. That has to be noted in any comparison too.

2731~~~
Rooney tends to play in several different roles but that's hardly ever taken into account when people judge him. All things considered it's quite the achievement to push out the stats he does, never mind the fact our overall play seems to sink without him in the team.

2732~~~
Aguero just can't take care of himself, that's why the lower amount of minutes. Always injured, broken, tired.

2733~~~
Yeah, it's pretty damning for him when you consider that Rooney is actually quite injury prone himself. He usually misses around a month every season.

2734~~~
What a terrible performance, assist aside. He should never play as a striker when we play a team that plays high defensive line. He was hiding for most of the game, it was really awful to see him ignoring at least 4 or 5passes of his teammates into his feet just for defender to intercept it high on the pitch because he was to lazy to protect the ball.

2735~~~
That was a pretty awful performance from him today. He couldn't control the ball, gave it away a lot as well. Luckily we won and no one is going to really notice but hopefully he's in better form for next week. Nice ball in for the second goal

2736~~~
Struggled against a Southampton side who didn't give him any space, and are generally good defensively. But when we needed a bit of quality, he produced a peach of a ball into the box, from which we scored. And those key contributions at vital moments are what Rooney brings you, even when he's not playing well.

2737~~~
Would love to know if the free kick assist was genuine or if that was over hit.

Possibly his worst 90 minutes in a red shirt today. Utterly hopeless on the ball and his decisions when to run with it were horrendous. Shake it off and move on to the scouse next. Bounce back there and we'll never mention this performance again.

PS the media bias towards him was appalling btw. Sky were scared to pick up on any of his failings.

2738~~~
Godlike assist.

2739~~~
Pointless display, no support for our forwards but he should've been doing better.

2740~~~
It was clearly a deliberate ball into the far post, designed for someone to get on the end of in exactly the way Van Persie did.

2741~~~
Failed at everything he tried today. One of those days for Wayne, and he knew it, as we saw with him whipping out his frustration at the ref throughout the game. He got very lucky with his free kick assist, their goalkeeper completely fecked up by not taking a few steps and clearing that ball. That goalkeeper mistake was just as bad as the back pass for the first goal.

2742~~~
He's always crap when he comes back from injury. You just have to accept it.

Fantastic assist though.

2743~~~
He was shit, but no more shit than most of our other players. Every time he got the ball he had zero support going forward(except RVP).

2744~~~
It's incredible how much missing only 1 game can affect him. Can't think of a player who benefits from playing 90mins game in, game out, like Rooney does.

2745~~~
Out-performed by Van Persie. How unlikely was that before the game?

Now can we please please have a game where they BOTH play well?!

2746~~~
Poor touch and every time he got a yard or several on a Southampton defender I expected the defender to get it back.

2747~~~
The incident before he was fouled by Fonte but got a yellow card when the referee gave it, I thought he could have done better. It's a typical bad Rooney performance, isn't it? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2748~~~
Great ball in, but yeah it was pretty much a game of real ring rust. Doesn't help when the rest of the midfield didn't show up either, but hopefully he plays better next week.

2749~~~
Very much doubt it had anything to do with a two day injury lay off. It just didn't happen for him within the context of an overall scrappy and disjoined team performance.

2750~~~
Yeah, you could said it by his partner's performance who had the same job. Oh, wait.

2751~~~
And there have been plenty of occasions this season where RvP has struggled and Rooney has played well. Sometimes good players have bad games. That's part and parcel of football, and anyone who doesn't have an agenda to push will recognise that.

2752~~~
Really poor, needs to pick up where he left. Hopefully he's fully fit on Sunday

2753~~~
Looks to me that he is playing poor when he is playing as a striker. I don't remember him having a good game playing striker this season, but he was very good in pretty much every game game when he was playing behind the striker(s).

2754~~~
I knew that will be your answer. I know van Persie was poor this season, I actually criticised him a lot too.

2755~~~
So what point are you trying to make exactly? And what was it about my point that you disagreed with?

2756~~~
I think Van Gaal would offer more as a player than Rooney did today. Utterly terrible performance. Probably worst I can remember from him. We would have been better served if he got sent off and we played with 10.

2757~~~
That your excuse for his performance wasn't really an excuse because van Persie who was usually crap this season played excellent game against the same defence, with same teammates behind him. It was just a poor performance, he'll improve, but don't try to make excuses.

2758~~~
Amar won't get it then.

2759~~~
Are you seriously trying to deny that the opposing defence was a factor in contributing to his poor performance? Because it clearly was. That's not an excuse as much as it's an explanation.

Even so, we're talking about a performance where Rooney pressed a Southampton defender into making a mistake for the first goal, and produced a great ball into the box for the second. RvP finished well on both occasions, and so now he's the hero, and Rooney's the whipping boy.

But that's football forums for you.

2760~~~
To be fair, there were times when he had the ball up front and there was, literally, no support. All of our players preferred to hang around in our own half. Nevertheless, a poor performance regardless.

2761~~~
"Worst performance of the season", and still involved with both goals.

Man, what a player.

2762~~~
Was furious with Valencia I believe then. Someone should've been coming on the right, but noone did, and he lost the ball.

2763~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That just about sums Wayne Rooney up these days.

2764~~~
He lost the ball for the first because he completely lacks any kind of pace at all. The second was a poor cross that any goalie above pub level should catch with ease. 

It was a completely rubbish performance, and he's supposed to be our talisman on the pitch. That being said, he's been good lately and he is usually just a wee bit crap after an injury, so let's see how he performs against Liverpool first. No doubt that LvG doesn't have the same rules for all players considering return to starting XI after an injury though...

2765~~~
You are a funny guy. That's like asking three years ago when could we have a game where both Nani and Valencia were good on both flanks. Asking a bit too much, mate!

2766~~~
Rooney didn't really press Fonte into a mistake, he actually had a poor touch.
Fonte wasn't really under pressure, he just didn't expect RVP to be there.
The free kick wasn't a great ball, it was a high floater which Southampton should have dealt with.
Fact is today RVP was very good while Rooney was poor.
Role reversal of what was happening a few weeks ago.
The thing that got me was how many people were writing off RVP.

2767~~~
Not a good game by him but chipped in when he needed to. However I feel the forwards were really abandonned by the wing backs especially, at one point in the second half Rooney had kept the ball decently up front and Valencia hadn't made the run down the right, which made Rooney really angry, and there was another instance before that as well. Not good as I said but our all round team performance was disjointed.

2768~~~
Jesus, now it's a 'poor cross'.

2769~~~
You won't get many people disagreeing that Rooney had a bad game but that's ridiculous: his pressing on Fonte that led to the poor back pass was good, and his assist for the second goal was absolutely brilliant.

2770~~~
Harsh.

2771~~~
I disagree on both counts.

2772~~~
Battled hard in a tough game with little service.  Surprised that him and Mata don't link up better but he helped out Young a lot and sacrificed his performance for the team.

2773~~~
Hey, you almost have 10.000 posts mate! Make it a good one <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

It's a little harsh, but he was rubbish!

2774~~~
Did well with the cross for RVP's second, but overall a poor game from him. It's the type that we usually get from Wayne whenever he's been out with an injury. The ball just seems to bounce off him. Hopefully he'll play himself back into form sooner rather than later.

2775~~~
How is helping the team out sacrificing his performance? That's just giving him excuses for being poor.

2776~~~
Disappointing performance and he did seem frustrated which didn't help him at all. Peach of a free kick for RVP's goal though. 

That's one thing you can never doubt about Rooney. He could be having a shite game with nothing going for him and then he will pop up with a piece of great play. He's not the most consistent of players game in game out but his ridiculous productivity can never be brought into question. 

I'm pretty sure he's saving his best for the Scousers as well. Watch him tear them a new one next match <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2777~~~
2nd worst player on the pitch after Elbows for me.

2778~~~
I just explained to you on van Persie's example that opposition defence weren't the main reason, because van Persie just played probably his best game in last year and a half against same defence. Rooney couldn't do the simple stuff right.

As for his involvement in the goal, wow, Rooney actually pressed Fonte, well done, I am surprised ref didn't give gift him the match ball at the end for his contribution.

And RvP is the hero because not only he scored two goals but because he also looked few levels above our any other player in all around play too.

2779~~~
He was very bad today, but worked hard all match and provided crucial assist for brilliant Van Persie finish.

Hope he ups his game for Liverpool on Sunday, we'll need both him and Van Persie being at the best!

2780~~~
So if one forward has a good game, that means the opposing defence must have been rubbish, and all of the forwards should therefore have had a good game? That seems to be your basic point, and it's a non-sequitur.

2781~~~
Again with the fecking injury. He was out for two days! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2782~~~
Good ball into the box for the second goal but a below par game apart from that.

2783~~~
It's only over the last 6 weeks or so that persistant doubts about RvP have started to creep in, despite nearly 18 months of underperformance by his standards. Whereas Rooney's been getting it in the neck from a certain section of the 'Cafe for years.

2784~~~
Not a great game from Roo today, but like I always say, at least he doesn't hide when things aren't going well. He keeps going, and thankfully provided an assist for Robins second goal, which was a great finish.

2785~~~
Poor game. Still got the assist though and so he continues his style of being effective even when poor. Hopefully he lifts for Liverpool though.

2786~~~
Poor performance. Hopefully he'll be back in form on SundaySunday

2787~~~
His ability to score or make an assist even when playing terribly really is remarkable. 

I'm not his biggest fan but you have to credit him with that, he's always making something happen even when he's rubbish.

2788~~~
I didn't say they were rubish, but surely they weren't great either considering they are pretty much one of rare defences this season that van Persie had a good game against, especially in his all around play, part of his game in which he was very poor this season. After all, they conceeded two goals tonight from only 3 shots. And again, it's not like you could admire their defending, it was Rooney who made a mess out of simple things in whole game.

2789~~~
They have the best defensive record in the league, even after tonight's result.

And Rooney didn't make a mess of that ball into the box, which lead to our winning goal - and my hunch is if AdM had delivered the exact same ball, people would be <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>-ing all over the place.

2790~~~
Was only able to follow the start of the game in the match thread and the comments about "Typical Rooney after injury" just left me with what the heck are people smoking? He was maybe out a couple days. He had longer out after the red card in terms of being match sharp and he did more than well coming back. Have not seen the game but, saying he played badly because of coming back from injury speaks volumes as to how people have just made their minds up about a player.

2791~~~
Struggled tonight and got a bit frustrated as a result. A lot of people, myself included, tend to mythologise the player he was when he was 22 or 23 but the big difference now is that he can have a poor game but still make a telling contribution. That was a terrific delivery for the 2nd goal so despite being well below his best, he was a lot more significant than a lot of our players who played just as badly but don't have the quality to produce a moment like he did.

2792~~~
Told you he'd be awful after being out.

Admittedly he's still been involved in the goals which is fair enough.

2793~~~
Seemed like he had butter on his boots tonight, lots of touches where the ball got away from him, but it's fair to say that Mata and Fellaini gave him very little to play to when he got the ball higher up the pitch, neither exactly bust a gut to give him an option.

2794~~~
I'm just hoping this is a once off bad performance, not just for Rooney but the whole team (apart from RVP and De Gea) were complete wank, plus we're in dire need of Shaw and Rafael back.

2795~~~
He had a bit of a mare, including being carded for descent, but he deserves the benefit of the doubt that it was an anomaly, just hope he turns up against the scousers.

2796~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OrdWXueAMKv/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2797~~~
That corner was special.

2798~~~
Had a big miscue earlier in the season as well - weird.

2799~~~
I'm not sure if anyone noticed but he nearly rolled his left ankle taking that corner. Imagine that, getting injured taking a corner.

2800~~~
I notice that a lot with players, not just at corners. Seems to happen a fair bit. 

Not his fault either that corner, if you look closely his standing foot raises the turf, knocking the ball out of place.

2801~~~
Yes i saw that that is why he went and inspected the turf to show people he wasn't to blame.

2802~~~
He was poor in this match but what i like at the end is that he ushered the players making sure they went to then away crowd to show them gratitude.

2803~~~
Its amazing how a player can be so good some games and complete toilet in another.

2804~~~
Amazing how many idiots come running out of the woodwork after one bad game, especially that Amar_. Can't wait for him to fail eh?

Thought he linked up well with Herrera, those two seem to have an understanding. Wasn't very good overall but as always not someone who hides which ensures that his poor games stand out more.

2805~~~
All things considered, he played decent. Good assist for RvP but struggled against Southamptons style of place, as did our whole team.

2806~~~
He wasn't good but still less shit than the midfield. There were a few times when he broke off on a counter but there was no one keeping pace with him and providing him options. The right wing was completely silent, I don't think Valencia crossed the half way line more than 2 or 3 times. At least he didn't hide and still contributed with the assist. Mata on the other hand was completely invisible and Fellaini looked like a pub player today in the first half (Fellaini though can be excused a bad game after being very good in a number of consecutive games).

2807~~~
Yeah it was as if he was the only guy with a semblance of pace in the team. Poor guy would run his arse off at the left and find that no one's kept with him - not even Valencia.

2808~~~
Dissapointing performance considering his recent form, but that freekick that lead to the second goal was a beauty.

Hope he finds back his recent form

2809~~~
I agree. He was ok. Our midfield was so static and deep and he got little support there. His strength isn't to hold the ball up, and there's only so long you can hold the ball up with no support before losing it. Unless you're Robin Van Persie.

I share Rooney's frustration when he punched the ground after he held the ball and drifted out wide, yet Valencia was dithering about by his own corner flag probably, and I don't know where any of the midfield were. We just never pushed on and took the game to them, and we were incredibly fortunate to come away with a win considering how deep we played with no counter attacking threat. Rooney gave the ball away a little cheaply, but I think just about everyone bar RvP and Carrick did.

2810~~~
Or that, in the close-up replay of the corner, it clearly showed the ground under the ball rising up as Rooney planted his foot - hence the mis-kick.

2811~~~
Perhaps an element of him missing AdM, because they do seem to have a great understanding breaking forward together - as AdM himself has said.

2812~~~
He needs to trust his ability a bit more. When he breaks he is always looking for an out ball rather than creating something himself. In that instance, We broke quickly and you cant blame a RB for not being up to support him.

2813~~~
5 goals and 3 assists in 11 appearances. Pretty decent going.

2814~~~
Aye, but he was still shit yesterday.
Why do fanboys get so upset about people calling as it is ?

2815~~~
Perhaps you should quote some posts from people getting upset and disagreeing that he had a poor game, before making accusations like that?

2816~~~
He has this Giggs-like ability that causes him to blame somebody else when he does something shite. I thought he behaved like a child last night. He's captain, and taking tantrums after giving up the ball isn't what we should expect to see.

Great cross for the second goal, however.

2817~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what? Where have I come across as a fanboy and where was I upset at any criticism of him?

2818~~~
I thought he was completely justified when he had that run from late and lost the ball with nobody supporting him.

As one of the only players in the team last night with pace, I suspect Valencia had been briefed that he would be expected to support furing counter attacks. So when Wayne was constantly looking towards his wing for support, it never came and he ran out of options. Hence the fraustration.

Thats not me doing my usual Valencia bashing FWIW, I've been very pleased with the job he had been doing at right back these last few weeks.

2819~~~
I think so too. I don't think he was good last night (though not as bad as some are making out), but at least he hasn't got anything to be ashamed about, he didn't hide and kept going throughout.

EDIT: about Valencia, I think he's ok as a fullback (but just ok), really don't think he suits the wing back role at all though.

2820~~~
The whole team was poor. RVP was clinical and that's why we won. Movement was dead, support was dead, passing was dead.

2821~~~
Did he have a shot yesterday?

2822~~~
There were only three attempts on goal, and two were RVP goals, so don't think he had a single shot, he had a chance on the left when he made space at the edge of the box and it opened up for him but then he just passed it.

2823~~~
Yeah he did that vs City too. Usually has a very good shot on him too.

2824~~~
When he was playing on the left he always cut in and bent the ball into the far post from that position, I have no idea why he didn't hit it. Probably just got sucked into the lack of confidence that was running through the team yesterday.

2825~~~
Yeah, agree with this, at least he kept going and kept trying to get on the ball.

Nope, Van Persie is the only player who did.

2826~~~
First of all I never mentioned anything about anyone disagreeing he had a bad game, but the fact is it clearly gets a few wound up when people do. Apart from RVP who WAS exceptional and DDG the rest including Rooney were poor. Are these types in all player threads defending them to the hilt when they play bad?
After all this is the Rooney thread, right? 

It was a high floating cross which Southampton defended abysmally. Godlike, sorry never.


I cant see anywhere in the thread where anyone says it was a poor cross, overreacting again.


Herrera was almost as bad as Rooney, they had an interchange when both were tripping over the ball.

As for NessunDorma he gets himself in knots trying to explain how Rooneys performance was every bodies fault but his.  FWIW I know Rooney is a very good player who does play utter shite from time to time.

2827~~~
I think he took an extra touch yesterday and went for the pass instead which was the harder option, not sure if he could have taken that chance first time.

2828~~~
---------------------

It was an outstanding piece of passing, high floating, yeah, but not something that it's easy to guess where exactly will it land. Disagree with you there.

Demi-godlike might be more appropriate though.

2829~~~
And I'm hardly upset, more amused.

2830~~~
Rooney had some really poor touches in the first half and he misplaced or made wrong decisions when he had the opportunity to pass it.  Herrera and him both missed Young wide open on the left late in the 2nd half when we actually had some possession in Southampton's half.

I thought in the 2nd half he had a better touch and dropped deeper to receive the ball from the midfield and from Young (who in particular was isolated both in possession and defensively and did an admirable job in both regards).  When Rooney did receive the ball in forward areas in the 2nd half he was far too isolated with the only available pass usually being back to Herrera or Mata.  The run where he carried the ball across the whole field and Valencia was standing in our own half refusing to give him an outlet was symbolic of our entire performance yesterday.  The one time we actually worked the ball through and got Young into space Rooney was critical to the move, but the referee pulled it back for a previous foul rather than playing the advantage.

Obviously that was a relatively poor performance from Rooney and he seems far less comfortable and able to play as an out and out striker than he does when he plays behind the strikers.  I feel that position gives him more of an ability to roam both in an and out of possession and he helps our build up play a lot.  Would have preferred starting Wilson up top, dropping Mata and giving Rooney the berth behind the strikers.

2831~~~
Apologies for the "poor cross " reference, my eyesight is as poor as Rooneys performance last night.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2832~~~
When we're able to keep the ball and have players creating then Rooney up front is fine but in games like this I'd much rather see him in the number 10 role.

2833~~~
Mate, you'll see like a hawk this coming Sunday. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2834~~~
Complete bullshit, and my posts are there for everyone to see.

I said he 'Struggled against a Southampton side who didn't give him any space, and are generally good defensively' - because that's exactly what I think happened. Southampton pressed him hard, and he's not always the best in tight spaces. His strengths lie elsewhere. Van Persie, on the other hand, has better close control and hold-up play, and so was able to cope with it more.

I said I doubted his 'crap' performance had 'anything to do with a two day injury lay off', but rather 'It just didn't happen for him within the context of an overall scrappy and disjoined team performance' (and if i'd wanted to make excuses, I could've easily played up the 'he's been injured' aspect, but I didn't, because I don't think it was a factor).

And then I said that 'Sometimes good players have bad games. That's part and parcel of football' - which is just a truism.

So can you please point to the posts where I tie myself 'in knots' trying to explain how 'Rooneys performance was every bodies fault but his', rather than the posts where I simply put his poor performance into the context of what happened in the game, and made general points about the nature of 'form'?

2835~~~
Exactly. He was poor and almost ineffective in open play, but he contributed to our winning goal with the free kick. He had horrible touches, his control was poor, he was struggling to get others involved other than his good understanding with Herrera, and he was frustrated for much of the second half. However, even though he was bad, he got an assist for the goal with the free kick that van Persie scored from. That's what world class players provide: results even if they're playing poorly.

2836~~~
Thus not being on the pitch to deliver the assist for RVP.......awful post!  Most of the team were shit you can't put it all on Rooney alone.

2837~~~
from a dead ball. He was total pony all game. He was actually detrimental in open play.

2838~~~
The opposing team can always be used as a reason a player didn't perform, that's what they are there for to stop the other team from performing. Its a pretty lame excuse for a poor performance and one that i have not seen used for the other poor performers. (although its already been established that my eyes are not very good).
Also I am not sure that Rooney was critizised much worse than some other players.
And the Southampton defence played a big part in both goals.


Bad technique?

Again when other players have bad games do we hear people come out with " he missed so and so not playing"?
No, they just get slaughtered.

Rooney is a top player , fact is he played shite as did the majority and as this is the Rooney thread people will comment on it.
You may look on these as facts, in which case they can be used as an EXCUSE for any player who plays shite.

2839~~~
He played shite, it happens get over it.

2840~~~
And the opposing team usually is a big part of the reason. You can call that 'tying yourself in knots trying to blame anyone but Rooney' if you want, or you can call it a 'lame excuse', I just call it straight forward analysis of his performance and the game.

If you have the match taped, I would advise to go back and watch the close-up replay. The ground under the ball really did rise up when Rooney planted his foot, and you can see it clearly. The commentators remark upon it as well. So no, I don't think it was down to poor technique. It was down to the ball unexpectedly moving at the moment he was about to strike it, leading to a mishit.

Utter bobbins again. Most of our players, especially the high profile ones, have their fan boys and girls, who'll defend them whenever they come in for criticism.

And if anything, it's Rooney who tends to 'get slaughtered' at the first sign of a poor performance or run of form when compared to certain other players. If some of us are over-protective (for want of a better word) it's because plenty of others are overly critical.

No-one is disputing he played shite. Some of us are just offering reasons as to why, beyond 'because he just did'.

Well yes, when good players perform poorly, there are usually reasons beyond 'because they just did' (which seems to be your 'explanation'), and people will expound on those reasons. That's not making excuses. Again, it's called 'analysis'.

2841~~~
I think I just proved my point.

2842~~~
You really LOVE Wayne, come on he had a bad game and so did many others its not the end of the world.

2843~~~
Okay then, have it your way. He was shite - just 'because'. Any comment or analysis beyond that means you are making excuses for him and trying to blame everyone else. ::contemptuous eyeroll::

2844~~~
And i've said as much about five times.

2845~~~
He still did it though

2846~~~
His finishing has been so good this season.

2847~~~
Lovely goal (again)

2848~~~
Well finished. Was in the perfect position and took it well.

2849~~~
He's been our best CM so far with Mata invisible and Fellaini being garbage.

2850~~~
Has he scored a scrappy goal all season? They've all been quality finishes, as far as I can remember.

2851~~~
Good goal, still loses the ball too much. Luckily Liverpool are garbage

2852~~~
Ssshh. Remember, you're not allowed to reference what the opposition did when assessing a player's performance, because that's just 'making excuses'.

2853~~~
11 goals in his last 15 games for club and country, and this while not even playing as a striker for United.

2854~~~
A decent performance today in midfield, but I hope this is a quick fix and not the solution in Van Gaal's mind, the furthest back Rooney should be is just behind the strikers. Loved the late run and goal, and was relieved to see him hooked as he was on a yellow.

2855~~~
That finish was so clever. Most would have (attempted) to lace it into the opposite corner.

The composure he showed to just place it in the corner he did was class.

2856~~~
From one end to the other.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/gZpE4Zn.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/gZpE4Zn.jpg"/>

2857~~~
Games like these I wonder why people want him to play up top. Was excellent in midfield today.

2858~~~
really coming into form.

magnificent today. Only De Gea could have edged him as MOTM with that display.

2859~~~
Another good game from the captain.

2860~~~
He really seems to enjoy playing under LVG more then SAF.

Does the job week in and out for us.

2861~~~
Yeah, very similar to his goal against Hull in that respect.

That's amazing, he really is quality when it comes to counter attacks.

2862~~~
Wonder why he was substituted though? To give him a rest? Still feeling his knee? LvG thought he was performing the worst out of him, Mata and RvP?

Because we've not often seen it happen this season.

2863~~~
Seems to fall back in his pre-knock form. Long may it continue.

2864~~~
el capitannnnn

2865~~~

2866~~~
The terrible pass to Van Persie just before the 3rd goal was the only really negative thing about his performance today. Bossed the midfield, gave 100% as per, fulfilled his captains role well and his goal was fantastic.

2867~~~
That last one is really impressive.

2868~~~
Pfft. At home.

What about cold, wet evenings on Wednesday at Stoke?

2869~~~
This is why I just love Wayne. I mean, I just don't get the stick he gets from some of the people on here. 

Today, Wayne showed yet again that when it comes to the big games, he steps up. He played as a box to box midfielder, and did more or less everything you want from a player in that position. Passed it well, got stuck in, calm on the ball, goal threat, supported the strikers. For someone who is a striker, I'd struggle to find anyone who can play the amount of positions he can and so well. 

Great performance from Rooney today, topped off by a great finish. True captain's performance.

2870~~~
Epitomises Wayne.

2871~~~
Another captains performance.

2872~~~
Our best outfield player I thought.

Looks brilliant this season. Loving his big game performances.

2873~~~
Good goal and a very responsible performance in a midfield role that doesn't allow him to play to his greatest strengths.

2874~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> sad

2875~~~
I liked him today, especially at the start of the game, not just because of the goal. His finishing is really excellent, he makes it look easy at times.

2876~~~
he didn't boss the midfield, lost possession a number of times.
Liverpool had plenty of chances thanks too a largely ineffective midfield.
He played his part as did De Gea , Carrick, Mata and RVP. Valencia was better than he has been of late and Fellaini was good 2nd half.

Cue the drama Queens.

2877~~~
It was more so Fellaini than Rooney who was the problem and a large part of the reason that Liverpool had so many chances is because our defenders didn't position themselves well.

2878~~~
Extremely pleased to have seen our captain score another great goal in another big game, actually. If only because it keeps the idiots in their box for another week.  <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2879~~~
Since that red card against West Ham, he has really matured as captain for both club and country. Heres hoping to an injury free run now (maybe why he was subbed - game done, no risk needed given his knock against Hull was last minute).

2880~~~
Class. How far away is he from Charlton's scoring records now?

2881~~~
So very good today.

I know he's been a cnut in the past with the contract and all that. But he is a utterly class player who gives his all. Would be alot worse off without him.

2882~~~
Good move taking him off. Give him some valuable rest for the games coming up.

2883~~~
About 26 goals I think, give or take 1 or 2.

I cannot wait for him to take it, I've always loved Rooney, even through the various different 'Rooneygates', and to me it'll be the single most significant individual honour any Utd player has achieved in my lifetime thus far.

2884~~~
Have to say Rooney's been impressing me lately. Very happy with the attitude and of course his goals!<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2885~~~
Very important to this Van Gaal team. Happy for him. Good to see him and RvP getting along well on the pitch too.

2886~~~
Happy with him today. Tidy on the ball, great finish for the goal (although the finish from RVP's pass was woeful). Good passing, found space and was a bit like the old brick-built Rooney that never lost the ball.

2887~~~
Very impressed with him, apart from Southampton he's been great since the red card.

2888~~~
Amazed his average rating on here is lower than Fellaini this season.

2889~~~
Funny thing is I don't even like fishing.

2890~~~
36 for the league all time and just 28 for the all time top scorer.

2891~~~
He and DeGea were miles away from any other players on the pitch. He was an ocean of calm and Liverpool couldn't get near him.

box to box and put a lot of effort into always being an option for cbs/wbs/mids and forwards - shaming Fellaini and Mata.

2892~~~
Thanks. Should take get both next season as long as he can stay clear of any serious injuries.

What a player he is. All the talk of him not living up to his potential is quite ridiculous when you put his achievements into context.

All time leading scorer of one of the biggest clubs in the world, and the same for his country. Add to that winning every trophy in sight, and at no point being anything less than one of the team's most important players throughout the club's most successful period ever. And now, topping it off, he is playing some of his best football and doing his part in resurrecting the club after the inevitable meltdown left in the wake of Sir Alex Ferguson calling it a day, and he's doing that as our captain, no less.

It's only because he is doing all this in the era of two footballing super humans that the magnitude of what he has achieved isn't fully appreciated.

2893~~~
Captain's performance today.

2894~~~
Way to bounce back after that terrible southampton game Wayne! He was good again today. I'm happy with him as captain, which I didn't think I'd say last year.

2895~~~
What a player. I have always admired Rooney because on the pitch he gives nothing less than 100 percent. I couldn't care less about what goes on outside the pitch. I mean there are players who say the same old "best club in the world and I love it" cliches in interviews but never perform that way. 

Some fans complain he hasn't been 'commited' to Man United or he's held the club ransom; even if these absurd allegations are true, he ALWAYS gives 100 percent on the pitch even when he's having a stinker.

Love you Wazza!

2896~~~
Give him a season and a half for both. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

2897~~~
The red card and general performances before he came back will have impacted that. He's been brilliant in all but one game since he returned from suspension.

2898~~~
He's been our best outfield player this season. Hats off to him.

2899~~~
He is really making us tick lately and seems to be thriving on being captain, really impressed.

2900~~~
bore off.

That's rubbish mate.

2901~~~
He was very good again though.

2902~~~
Watch the game again with your eyes open.

Mata was invisible in the first half.

2903~~~
On for slightly longer but a similar amount of touches and passes, with less dispossession and a lot less balls given away. Yet Rooney was 'an ocean of calm' that 'Liverpool couldn't get near'? Gotta note that Rooney was playing the deeper role of the two, so you expect him to do more and place more responsibility on him anyway. Just like you expected Mata to do more in those regards to Rooney last Monday.

Mata was involved in bringing the ball from deep for all 3 goals, scored, and made a key pass and the assist for the third goal.

Rooney, better? Maybe. Putting Mata to shame? No chance.

2904~~~
12 minutes plus injury time, Anyhoo I was talking in a more general sense... Mata had a good, productive game yesterday with the luxury of zero responsibility - good finish in a continuing streak of getting into the box which I love, and a great ball for RVP, tidy otherwise. However, we set up very similarly to last Monday yet LVG dropped Rooney as deep as he is likely to ever go... why? Because Fellaini and Mata proved that they cannot handle the responsibility of that role in bigger games against pressing teams.

Rooney is a better CM and a better No.10... obviously he's also a better striker. If Falcao is fit and firing, Mata drops out because Rooney is better in every role, for a player of his calibre, that's the shameful part.

Actually think about that - Rooney, a striker, was preferred to all other CM options (Carrick Notwithstanding) for this big game. Which other striker or no.10 in world football would be played like that? He's literally superior in his 2nd/3rd and even 4th choice positions to other 'specialist' players.

2905~~~
But he's fat, slow, shit first touch, pings to Valencia etc... 
I love how much tidier and sharper he looks this season. I was a little pissed van Gaal kept playing him behind the striker but man he would absolutely thrive with van Persie (in his current form) and a hopefully fit Falcao/Di Maria in the side too. With so many superstars in the squad Rooney still looks the greatest outfield player.

2906~~~
He's over rated, fat and should be sold...









...at least that has been the opinion of some over the last few years.

Quality player, very much needed. Well played lad.

2907~~~
You can spin that either way though. Before the game Van Gaal said he dropped Rooney into midfield so he could take advantage of Wilson's pace up front. Anyway, it's not really prudent to use our opinion of him (Rooney is a striker/best upfront) but then swap to Van Gaals opinion of him in other positions. Van Gaal said after the QPR game that he wasn't happy with Rooney as a striker.

We already know that Van Gaal wants him to play every game because he is his captain and can 'translate his philosophy' onto the pitch.

In regards to your comment on last Monday. I did actually wonder if you were referring to last Mondays game when you said he put Mata to shame. But then you clarified it as being yesterdays game in your reply.

Rooney had a very good game. I'm not sure it's fair to say he put Mata to shame though if you're taking this game in isolation. And if you want to say that Rooney in that role put Mata's performance on Monday to shame, you could say that Mata at number 10 yesterday put Rooney's performance on Monday to shame. Both are pointless.

2908~~~
Na, That's largely nonsense.

When everyone is fit, Mata doesn't start - we've already seen that. Again he was good yesterday but as a complete luxury, Monday's game showed just how wrong it can go for him and Fellaini - Yesterday he was outshone by a striker playing deeper... I don't understand how people can't see the impact of that. If it wasn't Rooney and a large portion of fans didn't have such a tremendous wealth of speculative bias against him, it just wouldn't happen. I mean look at this Caf rating for this season... it's laughable when compared to others.

Pass statistics and who scored.com does not alone paint an accurate picture - though I can understand why you'd fall back on that. Just look at their team of the season. RVP has an overall 9.2!

2909~~~
Ever since that video at the start of the season where LVG was telling Rooney to place a shot over power he seems to be scoring with placement all the time. Great goal and game, captains performance.

2910~~~
According to WhoScored, our <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Teams/32" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">five best players</a> this season (minimum 5 appearances) have been:

1. Phil Jones - 7.99
2. Angel De Maria - 7.40
3. Marouane Fellaini - 7.39
4. Marcos Rojo - 7.36
5. Wayne Rooney - 7.27

I do think these ratings are kind of useful, because they clearly measure certain kinds of contribution using an objective criteria. But they aren't the full story (e.g. De Gea has a lower rating than Valencia, Young, Herrera and Blind).

2911~~~
Wonderful team player. 

I say it over and over again, and I shouldn't - but I don't think I'll ever quite comprehend why so many fans wanted him out because he was over the hill. Absolutely mind-boggling.

2912~~~
The majority of that isn't in response to anything I said but just a perception of peoples views on Rooney, Mata and statistics and who you think should play.

It doesn't address Rooneys position and Van Gaals reluctance to play him upfront. Not apparent, it's an issue he's brought up himself.

And again, you can't really use Southampton game as a stick to beat Mata with as a midfielder but then ignore Rooney's involvement further up the pitch. This game, we were at home, played it out from the back better (still bad, but better) and Rooney being deeper and Mata further forward was a much better combination than the other way round last Monday.

You can't really pinpoint all the good to Rooney in this game and the bad to Mata in the last game though. The stats show that Mata got hold of the ball, in deep positions (so clearly wasn't shying away like you pointed out) and besides Rooneys reaching long balls was just as progressive. Not using the stats, you can see his influence bringing the ball forward from deep in all 3 of our goals. In terms of production, a goal, a key pass for a goal and an assist? Aswel as very tidy possession and a good amount of it for his position?

He did well. So did Rooney. Both better than last week. Rooney is in tremendous form for the most part.

As for the peoples perception on Rooney comment. I do actually agree, but you're definitely guilty of it yourself to the contrary. To tie him with De Gea and say he was 'miles ahead of all others on the pitch' is tosh.

2913~~~
Absotively - I love having a look and am glad of them, they can really augment what you say - but they can also mislead and a player can get a poor rating and have a good game.

2914~~~
I'd love to watch that game again with you and point out how very wrong you are.

2915~~~
I'm game. Lets do it.

2916~~~
I have watched it 3 times and still come to the conclusion that he was not miles ahead of everybody else and certainly did not run the midfield as someone said.
Liverpool had too many chances which comes down to the midfield as much as it does the defence.
I am not going to argue, because there are a few on here who treat Rooney like a god. I personally do not dislike any Manchester United player and am well aware that Rooney is a very good player and very important to the club, but people can have different opinions.
He took his goal superbly, he had a superb pass to Valencia and he worked hard as he always does. On the other hand he misplaced a few passes and got caught in possession several times.
Overall he played well, as did DeGea, Carrick, Mata (who he certainly did not put to shame ), RVP, Valencia AND Fellaini as bad as he might have been in the first half was very good in the 2nd half.

2917~~~
He played well but we were pretty poor in midfield yesterday, which should tell you something.

2918~~~
He was good yesterday. Miles better? Nonsense. Top finish for the opening goal. He's done the 'arrive late into the box' moments very well this season.

2919~~~
That one man alone doesn't make a midfield.

2920~~~
He's one of the best players in the world at what he does. A complete footballer that could play in any team in the world....

2921~~~
Yeah ok...

2922~~~
Here's a real treat for Wayne fans. And for the doubters, a reminder of why some of us rate him so highly:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kK4cLrsYQvY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

His 50 best goals, spanning 12 years, but excluding some of his recent corkers (because the video was made before they were scored).

What I love about it is the mix of eras, showing he was scoring great goals then, and he is still scoring great goals now.

2923~~~
He's not bad at all.

2924~~~
Playing United potential record goalscorer in central midfield as a starter continues to bother me. Play him as a 10 or as a striker or do not play him at all.

2925~~~
He's been our best player so far alongside RVP.

2926~~~
Yeah, weird timing for that post, he's been great.

2927~~~
He is a much bigger goal threat playing near the goal than he is playing away from it. Their are other attributes needed to be a good midfielder than playing Hollywood longball. Personally, I would not have shoehorned mata, Falcao, Van Persie and Rooney in the same team unless, we had an out and out defensive midfielder in the team, or during the last few minutes of the game when we need a goal.

2928~~~
If I had my way he'd always play as a #10 but he's doing very well today as a CM.

2929~~~
He is doing well, but our team lacks cohesion and Rooney playing alongside Fletcher is one of the problematic areas. Personally, I would like to see Rooney move further up and Di maria play in that box to box role.

2930~~~
Too good to be wasted so deep.

2931~~~
Some nice passes but clearly given instruction to sit and not get forwards. Wasted if you ask me.

Should be playing in Mata's position and have Carrick shift back into midfield.

2932~~~
Think he really is being wasted playing deep.

I'd move him up to number 10 and put Di Maria in behind, if he is fit.

2933~~~
Did good so far, I like him in midfield. Don't think it would have made any difference if he played upfront with teh service our strikers got so far.

2934~~~
I wonder if that's true. There was space. ACRES of space behind the forwards begging to be exploited and he just stood wherever he was and refused to attack it. If it was under instruction not to attack, it's profoundly odd because it runs contrary to LVG's philosophy of passing and moving. If it wasn't. he had a poor game in terms of contributing to build up play. 

Easy 5-6/10 today. Didn't do much wrong but didn't do anything bright either.

2935~~~
He was okay. Passing was fine, if at times quite predictable, but he still managed to create two of the best chances we had and more specifically, RvP had. We lose his goal threat from midfield though.

2936~~~
Lovely reverse ball through the middle to put RVP clean through on the keeper, I never get this  he only hits it wide, Mata plays through the middle, Mata hits it wide as much as Rooney and Rooney does play through the middle too.

2937~~~
Some of his long balls to switch play are lovely. Nevertheless I don't like him in this deep midfield role. He has much more of an impact on the game than Mata in the #10 role.

2938~~~
He was fantastic today. Tracked back, lovely passes, through balls. Only thing that was missing was a goal.

2939~~~
He does well wherever he plays he was good today.

2940~~~
I thought he was great, but it takes something out of us by him not being more advanced.

2941~~~
Good game today but feck sake it does my head in that we have to play him so deep when we so desperately need him up front. Can't we clone him?

2942~~~
93% pass success rate, 3 key passes and 15 out of 16 long passes completed. I've seen him have worse games in midfield.

2943~~~
Another very good performance in midfield today. Great ball for RVP chance too.

2944~~~
Absolutely wasted playing so deep.

2945~~~
He picked the easy option almost all the time. numerous balls to the wings as usual.

2946~~~
I thought he was fine, it was the fact that only Falcao made any runs that doubled the difficulty of his job, too many players square of him too often.

2947~~~
Did you miss the 2 lovely passes to RVP?

I swear people see what they want to see with Rooney.

2948~~~
Did good in midfield but really should be afforded Mata's role.

Understandably we didn't have too many central midfielders today. Nonetheless, he really should be either played upfront or in a position where he can be a goal threat. Its wasting him to play in midfield unless its for emergency purposes.

2949~~~
Fantastic? And you say I have an agenda. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He was fine, best player in the first half altough nothing special, but pretty average in the second half, almost invisible when we had to attack the most. He put two good balls for van Persie, did nothing wrong and that's about it. He should be playing more forward.

2950~~~
Just about sums it up. Did nothing to solve our problems with his utter lack of movement or willingness to attack the stacks of space in front of him. Not the brightest bulb in the squad in terms of offensive playmaking, but hey Juan's off playing Where's Wally yet again.

2951~~~
He reminded me so much of Scholes in the first 60 or so minutes. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2952~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2953~~~
He was good today. Anyone who slates him are just bitter. He produced a few killer passes, and moved possession well. Should really have bagged himself an assist or two today.

2954~~~
Think he plays it too safe when he's in center midfield. Was decent and had good stats, but he should have tried to run with the ball a bit more often and force the issue a bit more. Great pass to RVP for that chance when he should have scored, but I didn't think he was great or anything. Decent, but didn't take enough risks.

2955~~~
Was nothing special today. But hey ho...

2956~~~
When your upfront, out wide or in the 10 role you can take risks by running at people or creative passing, its harder to do and alot more risky for the team doing it from the holding role he had today. Your judging him as Rooney the 10 when he is playing alot deeper so he will play alot of safer passes because thats what the role needs. I mean the two passes for RVP today you'd struggle to see any defensive midfiler play that many creative passes in a full season, so this has to be considered when judging the performance.

2957~~~
He wasn't the defensive midfielder though, he had first Fletcher and then Carrick next to him. I'm not judging him as a 10, the reality is he played well but could have taken more risks and try to quicken the passing plenty of times more then he did. Nobody in our team was increasing the speed of our passing and that's why Villa defended so easily.

2958~~~
Of course he is. He's one of the best strikers in the world, yet Manchester United have to be Manchester United and play their very talented players out of position. Rooney is not and never will be a central midfielder. We can try it, but he'll be relegated to a terrible imitation of Paul Scholes, while nowhere near as good on possession.

Or, we can do the right thing, play him up top, and get a guaranteed 25+ goals a season. But like I say, we don't use common sense at this club.

2959~~~
In midfield he misses too many runs by our strikers, or if he sees them he decides against attempting the required passes, either way he's not a playmaker who wins you trophies.

2960~~~

2961~~~
This. Good post. Perfectly describes Rooney in midfield. He's not a playmaker. Period. Doesn't know how to look out for space and attack it either. 

To be fair I guess we had no choice but to play him there against Villa since all our midfielders save Carrick were struck ill or injured. And even then we decided in all stupidity to waste Carrick deep at centre back.

2962~~~
I was at the game yesterday. Rooney was awful. The amount of times he just lofts it to Valencia. Surely someone on the coaching team should tell him to stop that.

He doesn't have the finesse or intelligence to play in midfield or as a number 10. He has had a couple of good games recently (the Liverpool and Arsenal games) but he's also had a few stinkers-namely ydays game, So'ton, Hull etc. I dont get the hyperbole surrounding his performances this season because, on average, I'd say he's been ok to poor with a few decent performances dotted in.

I'd say most of the blame lies with LvG as its his philosophy, but I haven't seen anything consistently good or praiseworthy from Wayne. And this goes to a lot of the other players aswell. He should be playing higher up the pitch or not at all.

2963~~~
How exactly was he bad against Hull?!?!

You're going way over the top with statements like he can't play as a number 10, that's clearly just not true, he seems to get way more stick than anyone else after a bad game. And judging from his average rating I'm not the only one who thought he was actually alright yesterday. Not a midfielder, sure, I don't think anyone actually wants him to be playing there permanently.

2964~~~
Him & Mata in midfield is a mistake, I'd prefer him up top, but if hes going to play in midfield, then he has to play as the most advanced one and Mata needs to be sitting on the bench

2965~~~
The consensus is that he was quite good. And in my opinion, he was. Don't remember him doing much wrong, and he would've had a couple of assists on another day. Saying he was 'awful' is just pure hyperbole, to be honest.

But then here's a selection of your comments mentioning Rooney over the last few months:

--

(After a post slating him)

--
--

--

--

--

--

--

--

And so on and so forth. I can't quite put my finger on why, but I do get the impression that you don't rate the boy, and don't have a good word to say about him even when he does play well (which is often).

2966~~~
94% pass completion, with more touches than Carrick. He's definitely growing into this central midfield role. Horrible waste of his talents though.

2967~~~
Are you sure you were on the right stadium?

2968~~~
The one thing that Rooney did well yesterday was that cute pass to RvP.

Aside from that he was crap. I've grown up seeing penetration and a lot more finesse in Utds midfields and he didn't offer any of that. Stats can be deceiving and saying 94% this and that doesn't change how I feel about what I saw. He received the ball and lofted it out to Valencia about 100 times. Mata and Fletcher weren't much better (Carrick played well).

<a class="username" data-user="65492, @NessunDorma" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65492/">@NessunDorma</a> great selective picks of those posts. I like the part where you ignored my complementary posts about Rooney. That was good. I've been critical of Mata as well but let's overlook that.

I'm the first to admit that I'm not Rooneys biggest fan. Any player that threatens the club twice will, in my eyes, not be liked. But if he puts in great performances, then obviously I will start liking him some more. But he hasn't done that consistently this season. 

And lastly, he shouldn't be captain.

2969~~~
I actually thought his wide passes out to Valencia have been hit lower and harder lately and are looking more effective. Maybe I am just imagining that though.

2970~~~
Looks like Uzz is just another Rooney hater we shouldn't take his Rooney posts seriously.

2971~~~
Agree by and large with what Uzz says. Stats can really flatter Rooney especially after yesterday. His favoured cross field balls to Valencia while accurate really stifle the shit out of any creative play. For one, he plays it right into Tony, not into space behind a defender. Second, it's more often than not a floated ball, giving defenders the chance to reposition and challenge Valencia by the time it lands. Also, he failed spectacularly in terms of exploiting space and offering any movement or passing threat. 

As for the people questioning why people hate him at number 10, the reasons above plus his inconsistent and rather poor first touch and quick thinking are good enough reasons.

2972~~~
Not true. He played in RvP with an amazing lofted through ball in the first half, which RvP should have squared for a Falcao tap-in. And he played a couple of excellent passes to set Valencia up 1 v 1 against his defender. Not easy to thread passes through such a congested area but nevertheless he found that pass for RvP which should've been an assist.

2973~~~
Trouble with Rooney in midfield, is that he seems to hover in the midfield third. He should be playing like Toure, bursting in and around the box, but he tends to sit and spray. You get the impression that he's more interested in showing off his long-passing, which can be pretty exquisite, admittedly, but it'd be better to see him drive forward.

2974~~~
But he was at the game...

2975~~~
I remember you. The most blinded Rooney fan on these forums. Is your real name Kai?

2976~~~
Edit: wrong thread.

2977~~~
Erm . . . out of the <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/search/9809346/?q=rooney&amp;o=date&amp;c[user][0]=59626">50 odd posts</a> you've made about him since 2012, i'd say about 3 or 4 are vaguely complimentary. I 'ignored' them because they're as difficult to find as needles in a haystack.

And i'll be the first to admit that i'm a huge Rooney fan boy. Doesn't mean one still can't retain a modicum of objectivity about his performances, and again, saying he was 'awful' is just a huge exaggeration (and when he does play badly, like he did at Southampton, i'll say so).

2978~~~
I think you completely forgot about an instance where he did just that. You can't just make a forward aerial pass if the conditions aren't there.

2979~~~
Well this is where your argument lacks all credibility because you've purposely ignored my posts praising Rooney when he has done well. You need to understand I'm not going to praise a player if he doesn't perform, and simply put, he hasn't performed. I call it as I see it. 


See above. If anything I dont think you can retain objectivity if you are such a big fanboy of Rooneys. How can you?

And yes he was awful. For a centre mid, bar 1 maybe 2 moments, I thought he was awful. As I thought Fletcher was. As I thought Mata was. I think you take any criticisms of Rooney too personally and should spend sometime offline to relax.

2980~~~
No, because the posts criticising him out number the posts praising him by about 10:1. You hardly ever praise him - and when you do, it's lukewarm at best - but you slate him all the time (with much of that slating being of the exaggerated, hyperbolic kind, as previously mentioned). And that is simply not an accurate reflection of the balance of his performances.

It's not that hard. Fortunately, Wayne Rooney is a very good footballer, and so being a fanboy of his doesn't require much bias.

It's not like with you hater types, who need to exaggerate his flaws and downplay his strengths to fit your preconceived agenda of him being below the required standard for United and even England (!)

2981~~~
Granted that the conditions aren't always there but the fact remains that all it does it kill any offensive tempo and stifle creativity. In any case, I believe that we need more than an <b>instant </b>from him amidst game after game of these passes.

2982~~~
He created one of our best chances in the entire game and put in another great ball for RVP over the top. The problem with those passes out wide is Valencia's inability to do anything with it despite being 1v1.

2983~~~
When Rooney is pulled into midfield...we lose his lethal ability up front.

we need to bolster our midfield for sure...and from what has been said...we will be doing that.

2984~~~
<a class="username" data-user="65492, @NessunDorma" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65492/">@NessunDorma</a> and others.

I'm not going to praise Rooney for a poor midfield performance. Like I said earlier, some of the blame lies with LvG for playing him there, because he isn't the standard required. But some of you Rooney lovers are so blinded that you'll applaud him running around aimlessly for 90 min chasing down long a ball hoofed to the corner flag because it shows 'heart' or 'desire'. This place was full of them after the Arsenal game last year when we won 1-0. It's pathetic. One of your best players being 'back to his best' because he ran around a lot red faced. Is that what it's come to? We're paying a player £300k a week to run around aimlessly, and then we'll applaud him for doing so. One of our best players, on the highest wage.

When Rooney storms up and down berating an already fragile defence against Leicester that's 'good captain material'? Some people here were even defending him as it was his mistake that led to the goal, that led to him shouting at the defence, saying he made that mistake because of xyz. it's just pathetic. He is not a good captain. Him pacing up and down shouting like a bloody baboon, he did it again in another game can't remember against who, but you don't do that on the pitch. Look at Steven G after his pitch with his 'speech' after the City result. It damaged the team. This type of behaviour, in public, damages the team. Why do you think Fergie was so adamant to not let that video get out by Keane? Humiliating a player will never result in a positive outcome. That kind of remonstrating should be done behind closed doors. It's so obvious, but instead, you guys will clap your hands, and say 'he loves United now'. Give me a break. Keane gave players a hard time, but he did it in a much, much, more subtle way. And he led by example. How many average/poor performances did you see from Keane? I said it before, and I'll say it again, Rooney is not even 1% the captain Keane was. 

And, yes you can post stats about 94% pass completion and most touches of the ball, but did it hurt the opposition? Did it show? I mean, by all means, if he takes that many touches and has that pass completion rate, and we win 5-0, I'll praise the guy. But it did nothing for us. Absolutely nothing. He's not a good CM. He shows for the ball, and he can pass but that's it. He had a couple of good moments, yesterday, but I'm not going to settle for 1 maybe 2 moments every couple of games. His fitness isn't even that good. He was so obviously tired after the 70 min mark in yesterday's game, and he's only been playing 1 game a week. He's just a slightly better Cleverley as CM.

Anyway, I'm not arguing this with you anymore. By all means, clap him for running around and shouting at Tyler Blackett, and praise him when he passes the ball out wide to Valencia. It just shows the level he's dropped from when he first joined us if we're going to accept that as a sign that he's on top form.

2985~~~
My point is that he does them whenever he can, if the occasion isn't there, why would he do it ? It's not his fault if Valencia cannot produce anything when he gets the ball either.

2986~~~
I'm not criticizing his performance here <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Just griping about his constant need to play that cross field ball. I agree that Valencia doesn't do anything with them. But that's not the only problem with the diagonal. As I said before, it's something so predictable from him; a slow floated ball that does nothing to help our play in terms of tempo and creativity. Our overall play suffers because of this. You don't see Ander / Afro / Blind / ADM / Carrick pulling this shit off when they start in a diamond and hence the fluidity of our play.

2987~~~
He isn't a midfielder. He's not a #10 either. His best position is right up front.

He's been played there because of injuries. When everyone is fit and available, it'll be two of Rooney/Falcao/RvP.

2988~~~
It depends on what formation we use, but it seems that Van Gaal prefers Rooney as a number 10.

2989~~~
Was our best player against villa I thought along with Falcao. Hardly gave the ball away and created 2 chances that RVP should have done better with.

2990~~~
I think LvG is trying to Schweinstieger him.

2991~~~
You're speaking about Leicester game to state he isnt a good captain. My god...
Comparing him to Keane? Many players are or wouldnt be 1 percent the captain Keane was, so what, we probably wont have that kind of a captain ever again.
Since he became catptain he has been in a very oog form and certainly hasnt 'ran as a baboon'
His fitness isnt good? That's wrong also. From this post it's clear you dont like him so you cant be objective. Sure he isnt a mid but its completely wrong that he isnt a good nr. 10 as you said earlier.
And he wasnt good vs Hill, is that a Hull game from thius year or?
Not to mention the part about him dropping from when he joined us. That's a thing posters who dont like him love to repeat. In tead of accepting he's not athe same player like he was when he was 18.

But there's no purpose in this, you'll slate him for whatever reason you can find. Even comeing back to Leicester game of all things.

2992~~~
I thought he did ok against Villa but LvG was playing him too deep ala DM the traditional Carrick number 6 role, most probably because LvG had Carrick in the CB position. It was a pity because I had hoped after Abby got sent off that Rooney go higher and try to go for the goal however he stayed deep and did nothing really.

I don't know what LvG is trying, yes we have a defence issue but playing Rooney deep like that isn't doing the team any favours.

Also a big pity that RvP was taken off, I was shocked at that decision.

2993~~~
Imagine how many goals he'd have if he remained the main striker after the 2010 season.

As for the slating him for the cross field passes - Scholes looked to go out wide even more than Rooney. Difference is Nani, Giggs, Ronaldo and Valencia at the time could actually take on a defender and beat them.

Some of the long passes to Valencia against villa were excellent and Tony V should have done better with.

2994~~~
Thought his passing range was awesome, dont know the stats but he switched play linked up well I thought. Possession was good and he was influential in this.

I do agree he missed a couple of through balls to Falcao that could have been played and weren't. But his pass to RVP was class to set up his chance.

Mata also didnt play any through balls as I remember?

2995~~~
Can I ask how many key passes a player must make to break your definition of doing nothing? I mean he's put RVP in twice in a game were he's basically playing as a deep midfeild player??? Its pretty clear you have a personal problem with Rooney some of the stuff your saying well its just embarassing. Our central player have always looked out wide, so your critism could be extended to some of our all time greats if you have such a problem with those balls out wide. It's in the club's DNA to look to the wings, I would guess Rooney has that pass because he's been a teammate of Scholes for so long, he played that pass numerous times all be it on a more sonsistant basis but then no player imo could compare with Scholes in passing ability.

As for Keane he gave out numerous beratings down the years, he also ended up arrested before a FA Cup Final hardly the example a captain should be setting. Now Keane was a great captain and we are yet to see how Rooney turns out in the role but both have and will make mistakes, the characters they have assure that, We've seen some great amangers, Ferguson, LVG, Capello and some not so great in Moyes, Hodgson over Rooney's career but the one thing they have in common is they all made Rooney a key part of their sides that should tell you something, he will go down most probably as our top scorer ever, England's top scorer ever and one of the most decarated players ever, that got to hurt you..

2996~~~
I fecking hope not. Schweinstieger was a patchy winger before he converted, Rooney is one of the best finishers and goalscorers in world football.

2997~~~
I don't get why Rooney's getting stick for the game against Villa. In my opinion, he played like a cultured centre midfielder. Kept the ball ticking over, spread play (which was important against a very compact Villa side) supplied our front three (who didn't do much with it) and created a few goalscoring opportunities.

2998~~~
Scholes knew when to play it to the wing though. He'd control the tempo with a few short passes around the middle and then crack a beauty out wide which would leave the winger 1v1 or would free him up to run. Rooney takes forever playing the ball and by then they've already doubled up on the guy out wide.

2999~~~
Preaching to the choir man, but I just get the feeling that is where we are heading with Rooney under LvG.

3000~~~
His finishing this season has been class.

3001~~~
How many more goals to be our all time top scorer? Not sure if the wikipedia article on it is updated.

3002~~~
Fantastic again today. Plays in midfield scores 2 like a striker.

3003~~~
Legend! Just love the guy.

3004~~~
Rooney has done a fantastic job so far in hes new role. He is getting from box to box, putting in a shift and still scoring goals. I dont know how that could be negative? He is not quite there yet in terms of dictating play and making the right decisions on the ball like the top top world class midfielders but he is not giving the ball away and he is making great runs forward. Give him some time and he will really be great in that role, he will learn when to spray it out wide and when to play the short passes and we will have a new excellent midfield player in our squad.

Considering  that is where we lack alot of quality that cant be bad right?

3005~~~
The timing of his runs into the box are fantastic. Both times nobody picked him up.

3006~~~
224 at the moment, needs 26 more to get ahead of Sir Bobby.

3007~~~
Timing his runs into the box brilliantly. Looks like he's taking the MF role pretty well.

3008~~~
The late runs into the box with Falcao and RvP pulling the CB's out of position have been superb and he is doing his defensive duty as well, great half from Rooney.

3009~~~
The great thing about this new midfield position is opposition midfielders are not used to (and most probably not good enough) to track a class striker's runs from deep.

3010~~~
Awful again today yeah?

3011~~~
Early days but he could be our version of Lampard in midfield under LVG,ghosting in and scoring sh*t loads of goals.

3012~~~
Good point. That really is the key to his role, the dedication he had in his runs is something you just see from top strikers.

3013~~~
What's more, it looks like he's enjoying playing in that position as opposed to being frustrated he's not playing out and out striker. Today shows he can still fill his boots from a deeper position.

3014~~~
We can't know that unless we're at the stadium.  <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

3015~~~
Scholes-like in both his goals. Perfectly timed runs right through the defence for easy finishes.

Looks energized too now that he has added responsibility as Captain.

3016~~~
Yeah <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3017~~~
Fantastic game from him today he deserves a hat trick along with Falcao.

3018~~~
This formation is the best thing to have happened to him, he's impossible to mark when he arrives late after dropping so deep in the build up.

3019~~~
Two important goals in that way. He will get a blooded tooth knowing he can score from that position as well.

3020~~~
Rooney as a box to box is a master stroke. Having two intelligent strikers ahead of him, as well as Mata. There's enough to trouble any defence and he's using the space they create perfectly.

3021~~~
So glad I left him in my fantasy team. They should really change him from a striker to a midfielder, though.

3022~~~
Yeah. The only problem I see with it is that perhaps his defensive responsibilities may suffer. It's something that could be exposed against stronger teams.

3023~~~
2 goals 1 assist so far, he is so shit <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3024~~~
Second cross field pass in the game that finds RVP. Unbelievable game from him, best I've seen in I don't know how long. Not just end product which is what usually is a good game from him.

3025~~~
Sell him, he's shite. Christ the amount of tripe...

3026~~~
Back heel passes now, he's taking the piss

3027~~~
To be frank we need to accept that. We already have an extra central defender, the few times he does push forward the least you can expect is that extra man to do some use. 

It is kind of like using two rain boots because it is raining, doesn't really improve the situation.

3028~~~
playing like an absolute beast today

3029~~~
Rooney is a match winner, simple as. His short passing remains baffling bad at times e.g. today he sold Young short much more than once. However, Rooney is capable of doing things few players can and when you need a goal he's always capable of getting you one. Thriving under Van Gaal.

3030~~~
Best outfield player this season by a considerable distance. Fair play to the guy.

3031~~~
If anyone can name a player who can play a number of positions as well as Wayne does, please let me know.

3032~~~
Another fantastic performance from midfield. Yet some will still say he is better as a number 9...

Looks like Falcao and RVP drag the CB all over the place with their movement and he can take advantage of that with his smart runs. Great to see that.

3033~~~
Briliant performance and took his two goals so well. The timing of the runs was perfect. Shades of Scholes!

3034~~~
Box to box, 2 goals and an assist, if I wore a hat I'd tip it to the Captain.

3035~~~
I think the one weakness in his game is he can't play that well half paced which comes across sometimes when he's playing those easy short passes. As soon as we went 3-0 he eased off and lost a few passes before then he hardly lost the ball. Looked good though today and in the final third he comes alive.

3036~~~
Will he be the first player to convert from a striker to a centre midfielder and play well?

3037~~~
Fantastic today. Scored two goals (despite not being played as a striker) and then created the Van Persie goal.

He's playing like a brilliant leader this season.

3038~~~
I thought he, like most of the team, switched off after the third goal today. His passing got sloppy, and he was slow on the 50/50s.

Still, brilliant runs for the two goals, and when he was fully focused, put in a great performance.

3039~~~
Paul Scholes says hi.

3040~~~
Multi-functional

3041~~~
How could I forget!

3042~~~
I had to read Skarsgard interview in order to understand the meaning of this comment, ffs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3043~~~
Some player.

3044~~~
Yep. Would have been a perfect performance had he not completely switched off. Considering we are playing again on Sunday I guess that's natural though.

3045~~~
What the hell, thought it was international? :S

3046~~~
So is that Wayne Rooney now then . . . attacking midfielder?

But a great display today of what he's all about. Two really good finishes for the goals, a very nice ball over the top for the assist (no-one seems to rate his passing, but he does that kind of thing quite often, which is how he gets his fair share of assists in the first place), and tidy, functional play during the build up. Always moving into space to receive a pass.

With world class quality around him (RvP, Mata and Falcao rather than Welbeck, Hernandez and Berbatov) he's looking as good as ever.

3047~~~
Completely dropped off between 83:41 and 87:19. Expect better from the captain.

3048~~~
Remember when people (usually ABUs) thought he and LVG would fall out?

3049~~~
Universal contract rebel with incredible talent. He's staying here for the rest of his career though.

Some surgical moments of football, not only today.

3050~~~
Well, google didn't help me with it much - it only showed me some weird test with Swedish idioms and this interview/article, which explains the meaning. So I'm not sure - but I don't know all English idioms, of course.

3051~~~
He looks so much sharper this season than he had been for some time . I like this version of Rooney. Brilliant again today.

3052~~~

3053~~~
So, ermm, <a class="username" data-user="59626, @Uzz" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/59626/">@Uzz</a>

3054~~~
He always was great with his late runs and finding the perfect position inside the box. And defenders/midfielders in Premier league aren't suited to face midfielders with that impecable movement (the main reason that Lampard is still around and playing on a very high level is his runs). Always nice to have an unmarked player with goalscoring instinct running late from midfield - especially when we have 2 strikers in the box already.

Great performance from him today.

3055~~~
Great performance from him, 10/10 no doubt!

3056~~~
Dwight Yorke was decent for Sunderland in that role.

3057~~~
Brings goals from midfield...

3058~~~
Many of the Rooney haters on here as well. Also an even more popular opinion would be that Van Gaal wouldn't use him in midfield because he's not good enough on the ball or some shite. Just a world class player.

3059~~~
I don't think the idea that they <i>could've </i>fallen out was that ridiculous - it was certainly possible - but thankfully it hasn't happened so far and Rooney's playing well under him.

3060~~~
So good.

3061~~~
improves with every match it seems...

coming into his best form....

3062~~~
There are names who seem to have a vendetta against Rooney who haven't praised his performances this season, apart from the rare occasions where he goes missing. Typical.

What a player. The assist was just glorious, how many times has he played that pass to RVP? Perfectly placed each time.

3063~~~
Seriously, what is he on? Game after game since he returned from that suspension he's appeared to up his game.

Glad to see him score those goals today. The tracking back at times was brilliant to see. Hopefully he can carry on banging out 8/10 or higher performances for the rest of the season and send us in the right direction.

3064~~~
Our best player last year too. He was poor in 12/13 though. Has made up for it. Can't wait to see him back in the Champions League where he belongs.

3065~~~
Best outfield player I should say.

3066~~~
Scholes has been mentioned, and Brian McClair dropped back into central midfield for us after we signed Cantona if I remember correctly and done okay. I'm driving myself mental trying to remember non-Utd players who have done it, as I'm sure its not that uncommon, but the only one I can think of is Ruud Gullit, who peaked as a forward but was pretty much top-class in every other position too.

3067~~~
World class. Can play any position asked of him and remain effective. what else is there to say.

3068~~~
Once the stupid internationals stopped (and he'd banged in a few goals) he seemed to make a point in a couple of interviews of saying he wanted to help United now and get goals for us, he seems really focused now England duty isn't getting in the way.

3069~~~
have always backed the lad...and am glad he will eventually be among the 10 greatest players to have worn the shirt for us.

He is going to break the goals records for both club and country.

3070~~~
He's immense. My player of the season along with De Gea so far.

3071~~~
Schwooney

3072~~~
Played really well today. Glad that he got the two goals, it's two closer to the EPL record.

3073~~~
He is playing so well but, still seemed a bit sloppy with some of his touch today. I know we are short in midfield right now but, actually hope when we get the likes of Herrera, Blind, Fellaini back - LVG will think to use him up higher on the pitch and not necessarily stick with Falcao/RVP up top.

3074~~~
Great game - seemed to really enjoy playing alongside Mata in the midfield as opposed to being alongside Carrick (as obviously it meant he was further up the pitch) and some of the interplay between the two of them was first class.

3075~~~
Damn right.

3076~~~
Agreed, completely.  

Doing as we wish with Rooney against Newcastle is one thing, but we do need to strengthen our midfield to return Roo to his rightful place as a second striker.

I'm not in love with the RvP/Falcao partnership yet, but it's still early days.

3077~~~
I thought his touch only became a bit sloppy at the end of the game where he seemed tired. Van Gaal said post-match that he has the lung capacity to play as a box to box midfielder for 90 minutes which I thought was interesting. It can't be easy adjusting between the two roles.

3078~~~
Didn't he ask for a transfer because he was being played in CM? Seems to be enjoying it now...

3079~~~
I thought there was a lot of potential for problems there but I underestimated Rooney's willingness to adapt. Perhaps his perspective has changed so I suppose mine can as well. I can't argue his commitment to the team at this point and he seems to be a dutiful captain and key to our success. In other words, the time is ripe for another prostitute scandal.

3080~~~
He's unrecognisable from the player that joined United in so many ways

3081~~~
Scholes? Is that you?

3082~~~
Cementing his all-time status and inching towards some real legends of the game in terms of sheer numbers :

Premier League goals :

Alan Shearer : 260
Andy Cole : 187

Thierry Henry : 174
Frank Lampard : 165

Premier League assists :

Ryan Giggs : 131
Steven Gerrard : 100
Frank Lampard : 96
Wayne Rooney : 93
Francesc Fabregas : 83

Premier League most goals for one club :

Thierry Henry : 175
Wayne Rooney : 166
Frank Lampard : 147

Select European elite clubs' highest goalscorers :

Juventus : Alessandro del Piero (290 goals)
Roma : Francesco Totti (287 goals)
Internazionale : Giuseppe Meazza (285 goals)
AC Milan : Gunnar Nordahl (221 goals)

Will probably end up with 300+ goals and 125+ assists for Manchester United if not more. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3083~~~
You know how the press and rival fans (and many of our own fans actually) say that Rooney hasn't fulfilled his early promise, well he's 100% certain to become our all time leading goal scorer (barring injury) and has a chance to become England's all time leading goal scorer. He also has an outside chance of becoming the Premierships all time leading goal scorer (although that will be hard) and thats from a striker that hardly ever plays as an 'out and out' striker!.
He's also had more career assists than most top strikers get in their entire careers.

It makes you wonder what peoples expectations actually were of Rooney when he first burst onto the scene.

EDIT: Right on cue, the post above mine showing exactly what i mean.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3084~~~
A lot were probably expecting him to be the very best in the world.

3085~~~
The complete footballer- always has been. It's no surprise to me that he's doing so well in midfield. Personally I've never understood why he has been ranked so low on world player lists. He's in a top five position for me and, when you take in to account all round footballing attributes, he's the number 1.

3086~~~
Well thats not Rooneys fault and he's been one of the best players in the world at various points in his career (even the press and pundits have said that).

He's still the 'heartbeat' of the team and we simply look a worse and more fragile team when Rooney isn't in it, even when he's in bad form.

3087~~~
Then ask yourself how many of the above can make passes like a Pirlo or Scholes, who are masters of last ditch tackles, or who can neutralise a key opponent completely out of the game. Remember the jobs he does on the likes of Arteta to block passing lanes a la Carrick.

3088~~~
Is there actually a player who can do what Rooney does to such a high caliber? Struggling to think of any players who can go from playing as a striker to a midfielder at such a high level and looking great in both positions.

3089~~~
glad we paid him what he wanted now?

3090~~~
He's really enjoying himself under LVG. Truly deserving his captaincy. I think finally all his contract and transfer bollocks can finally be water under the bridge.

3091~~~
As he's so damn old, a lot is missing for Giggsy, didn't track assists for pretty much all of 90s. I did though. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

By my count, he's on 195 PL assists. Have Rooney on 99. (guess the difference between me and some sites is how we see what an assist is, I do count fouls that lead to direct free kick goal as one, some sites do too, some do not)

They both have a buttload, that's certain. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3092~~~
Yup, fantastic numbers.

3093~~~
Unofficially, how many for Scholes do you reckon ? We could very well have three separate 100+ assist makers from one club ! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

That on top of 100+ goals for Cole, Rooney, Ruud, Giggs, Scholes and possibly Van Persie in the near future.

3094~~~
So glad he stayed with us always gave it his all on the pitch couldn't care less to an extent what he does off it.

3095~~~
Cole had a load of assists as well as his goals that goes unmentioned most of the time. Would be interesting to see a goals+assists all-time chart for the Premier League. Rooney, Giggs, Henry would be top I imagine.

3096~~~
Loving his performances this season. With Falcao and RVP making brilliant runs, it's creating a lot of space for Rooney and Mata.

3097~~~
Seems like LVG has found the perfect way of giving him the freedom he's always wanted without it hindering us in an attacking sense, I still wonder if it's viable in the big games to play 2 strikers and Rooney but he's certainly looked good in the role in our last two home games (albeit against weak opposition)

Wherever he plays does anyone think he won't end up being the record PL goalscorer? Only needs like another 80 goals or something similar

3098~~~
Since he was so far out in front goals wise, Shearer would probably make it into the top 3.

3099~~~
He's absolutely flying at the moment. Not happy about him playing quite so deep because he can be sloppy at times, but not everyone has to be as neat as Xavi in that role I suppose. Especially not in this league.

3100~~~
Looks like having a year of LvG moulding the team together is perfect timing for the CL. With Rooney looking like he is completely reinvigorated as our club captain, we can make a real statement next year. The linkup between him and our other attacking players was beautiful to watch.

3101~~~
Proved me wrong (again!) this season. I will never ask for him to be sold again. Not sure if I like his new role but he's still a class player. What's best is that we don't have to rely on his every match which eases the pressure on him a bit. Great captain so far.

3102~~~
Rooney's numbers are great and the incredible thing is they would be even better than they are if he was not constantly being moved from position to position for the benefit of the team in order to accommodate other attacking players and to give the team balance. While United have no doubt benefitted from it, Rooney on an individual level has suffered to a certain extent as a result of his versatility and selflessness. His goals per game record would be even more impressive and he would have perhaps won a top scorer award or two if he was played more regularly as the main striker with the team geared around setting him up and creating chances for him as well as having other players doing the hard work for him and allowing him to focus only on scoring and making the difference in the final third. No matter where he is played he will always put a shift in and contribute defensively and when he is used up front or on the wing and United's midfield is getting overran or under pressure he can drop deep or move inside and help them reclaim control of the game. He is an excellent player and world class on his day and he has been very underrated in recent years.

3103~~~
Saw my mate, the other day........

3104~~~
I like Wayne Rooney doing his Frank Lampard impersonation better than any of his previous roles.  This box to box role doesn't force him to be the focal point of the team and he seems to be thriving on the extra freedom of being a runner instead of holding up the ball as a striker or being the creator when played behind the main striker.  

IMO this is the first time he has truly bought in to being a midfielder.  He is doing more of the small things right when played there than in the past.  

I thought he would be inflexible and resist his role change under LVG.  Hopefully this match is a start of things to come and not a one-off.

3105~~~
Wayne Rooney's biggest asset is his ability to adapt. He's one of the best strikers out there but always adjusts for the better of the team. How many forwards would sacrifice their position for the benefit of the team for as long as Rooney? He's been excellent this season under van Gaal. I had a big problem with Rooney and Mata together in midfield but yesterday they both were lovely to watch. The runs that van Persie, rooney and Falcao made during the first goal was reminiscent of the Ronaldo-rooney-Tevez fluidity. There was no question about his importance and role as a team leader but he's sure as hell shutting people up for good.

Superb finish for the second goal as well. What impressed me the most about yesterday's performance was his movement in midfield, his passing decisions and his overall workrate. He played like a genuine box to box midfielder. Always picked the right choices, not many bullshit hollywood long balls that takes ages to reach valencia/Young. Crisp passing and he knew when to dribble and when to release the ball. His best game as an AM for us. He deserved a hat trick. That free kick should have gone in.

3106~~~
I don't really get this. He's shown he's adaptable throughout his entire United career. The LVG and Rooney not getting along angle was just wishful thinking from a group of United 'supporters' so much so that many of them had no problems buying the 'Rooney did not want LVG as manager angle' in the Daily Mail.

3107~~~
Read the words I chose to write. WILLINGNESS to adapt. He broke rank over not wanting to change his game and play deeper, and now he is <i>willing</i>.

3108~~~
Shy by just two! (though, in all comps)

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/manchester-united-goals-and-assists-1987-88-today.396084/"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/8oA9gi1.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/8oA9gi1.png"/> </a>

3109~~~
When this guy retires and people look back on his career, it'll look very unique. He might not be the 'best player in the world' but what he's done throughout his career, this ability to perform at the very highest level in a variety of positions, is quite special and isn't being appreciated as much as it should. A real world class player.

3110~~~
Using this website ( <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.premiersoccerstats.com/Records.cfm?DOrderby=Ass" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.premiersoccerstats.com/Records.cfm?DOrderby=Ass</a> ) which obviously isn't official since I don't think Opta tracked things like assists prior to 2003 but it looks fairly accurate, I got the top 5 goals + assists as

Giggs - 392
Shearer - 382
Lampard - 348
Rooney -  325
Cole - 322

Probably not right but I doubt it's far off.

3111~~~
Making him captain, also seems to be helping.

3112~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Gerd Muller's stats

3113~~~
He had already proved how much he has grown up last season for me by fighting for the side when so many others had pussyed out because they were unhappy with moyes....*cough*rvp*cough*

This season he has just been integral to everything we do, I'm glad to be proved wrong about him on midfield, loving him as a driving midfielder

3114~~~
As long as he's scoring plenty of goals from midfield,would he be happy playing in midfield from now on ?

3115~~~
Unsurprising given our fixture congestion in the next week and a half. Impossible to play every 90mins at 100%. Need to keep something in reserve. 

Rooney was excellent yesterday. Leading by example. A real captain's performance. One of my issues with him in midfield in seasons past was that he seemed to feel some obligation to play 60 yard hollywood balls across the pitch almost every time he got the ball (even when it wasn't on). He seems to have cut that down a lot and the ball to RvP for the goal was lovely.

I agree with the poster who said there isn't another player who can play so many different positions to such a high standard. No wonder LvG loves his versatility.

3116~~~
He has been truly superb the last couple of months. There are no doubt various factors at play (maturity, fitness, settled family life etc) but I have no doubt he has been reenergised by the recent changes at United, particularly the fact that, for the first time since Ronaldo and Tevez left, he is playing with a group of attacking players who are on his level and for a team that is on the up (after the Moyes debacle and the slightly stale feel of the final Fergie years).

3117~~~
Who comes closest to mind is probably Muller, can play striker, second striker, no 10, on the wings, hasnt he played in midfield yet? <a class="username" data-user="56994, @Balu" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56994/">@Balu</a>

3118~~~
Imagine if we sold him to Chelsea last season <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Gotta thank Moyes for keeping him here, even if it was at the cost of £300k/w

3119~~~
He would be godlike if it wasn't for all those transfer requests, such a shame really. He's absolutely on fire right now, glad to see him in such good form.

3120~~~
I have read this so many times and it absolutely does my head in. When Rooney himself said it I lost a lot of respect for him. If Rooney was the best option to play up front, that's where he would play. The idea that he's some sort of martyr who selflessly does all of the donkey work so fancy dans like Ronaldo and Van Persie get all of the glory is utter utter nonsense. People praise his ability to track back and his versatility yet when he's asked to use those qualities it's like he's being asked to donate a kidney.

He has matured a lot this season (as a player at least). I thought making him captain was a mistake but he has responded to the role superbly. He was excellent against Newcastle and I was impressed with his maturity at Villa too. I've heard a lot people describe him as an intelligent player but I have never seen it until recently. He deserves a lot of credit for how he has played this season.

3121~~~
loved the way he is making those late runs into the box a la scholes and lampard. did exactly the same thing againts liverpool 2 weeks ago too. i am loving this falcao-rvp-mata-rooney front 4 at home, and add di maria to this list and we have an excellent front 5, eventhough this can be a bit gung ho.

this role is great for rooney , for home matches. still prefer to see him playing further up the pitch / as a striker for away games though. he is less effective when he is further away from goal. plus he is actually one of our quicker players at counter attackings.

3122~~~
Exceptional performance yesterday. He plays that long diagonal pass into to RVP quite a lot, those two have a real understand of where each other is on the pitch.

3123~~~
But there are some 'star striker' types who would throw their toys out of the pram by being asked to 'do a job for the team'. By and large, Rooney never has - there was the issue of him supposedly not wanting to play in midfield under Fergie, but we don't know how much of that was just smokescreen to mask deeper friction between them.

Otherwise, he has always performed well in any role that's been asked of him (some of them far less glamorous than scoring bucket loads of goals, which is what he would be doing if played as an out and out striker).

3124~~~
Like who? Name one striker for a top team who has refused to play in another position. This is Manchester United - an elite team in world football whose fans expect players to be desperate to play for. Yet Rooney is a saint for not threatening to leave when played out of position? And then he does just that and he's still Mother Theresa!

3125~~~
His rating on the CAF is shocking.

3126~~~
6.4 isn't terrible, not sure anyone has cracked a 7 yet -- De Gea is rated 6.9.

3127~~~
I'd have Rooney between 7-7.5 but De Gea should be approaching 9 he's being outstanding, harsh our fans with the ratings.

3128~~~
What a weird comment. He's been working his socks off for United, in every position he's been asked to play, for his whole career at the club. Where on earth did you get the idea he's been doing it reluctanly? It's just the way he plays football.

3129~~~
I'm pretty sure this ratings are broken.

Exactly like <b>Match Day</b> which has 5.9 Robin van Persie higher than 6.4 Wayne Rooney in <b>Highest Rated Players </b>box.

3130~~~
Yeah. Mine for Rooney is much higher than the Caf average.

3131~~~
I don't see why this is your response to those two comments. It's undeniable that Rooney's stats would be better if he had played his career up top, and arguably it is his best position. That doesn't mean he's the best option to play there, especially when players like Ronaldo and Van Persie are his competition.

3132~~~
Incredible, aren't they? Not only does he have the numbers and great records, he has done it on every stage and has scored goals in World Cup and European Championship finals, four goals over two legs in a European Cup winners cup semi final, three goals in three European Champions Cup finals (and in the year he did not score in the final he scored three goals over two legs vs Real Madrid in the semi finals) as well as pummelling the small teams. His goal record stands up to any scrutiny.

3133~~~
We should block being able to rate player performance until like 24 hours after the game. the average ratings are a joke right now.

3134~~~
Horrible thought. To think many posters on here were saying he's finished anyway and we should take the money! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3135~~~
That's a good idea I suppose, wonder what mods think of it.

3136~~~
It's been suggested before. It makes sense to try it out.

3137~~~
He's having a wicked season, but he needs to stop thinking he's Iniesta with those dribbles and side passes. He get's tackles/intercepted nearly every time.

3138~~~
That is not my point at all. The comments I was replying to mentioned that he "suffered" and "sacrificed" because of his selflessness. I read it all the time with Rooney. He played in a slightly deeper role every now and then. Other players do it all the time yet with Rooney it's listed up there as one of his greatest traits as a player.

3139~~~
Because he's so fecking good being a striker and 3rd in United's all time top-goalscorers list, and he's moved back into midfield, knowing there's less chance of goals despite trying to break the goals record and help the team to titles. 

Sure players play other positions, but Rooney for a majority of his career has had to alter his game just so another player can thrive. Take Ronaldo for example. Rooney had to be pushed to the wing many, many times during those days. With that being said, despite being shifted to play in various positions, he manages to boss it, or at least be highly effective at it. Not many players spring to mind at how they just naturally fall into place into a relatively alien position for them. 

Hence why I think the term "sacrificed" is correctly used in this regard. I'm sure Rooney would have broken the goalscoring record by now if he had stayed up front for his whole career. Without shadow of a doubt in my books. 

I do see where you're coming from, but seeing how John O'Shea or any other player just plays in a different position and how Rooney plays in a different position - you get a totally different set of results.

3140~~~
I probably should have only quoted the individual sentences to avoid the ambiguity but again, that wasn't the point. My point was that when Rooney plays deeper he's being selfless and he sacrifices for the team. Why is playing wide or in midfield for United a sacrifice?

Maybe his stats would have been better if he played every game up front. Maybe they would have been worse if he could only play up front because he might not have always been in the team.

3141~~~
Yeah, he has played a few games in a role that you could call box to box midfield, but rarely and it isn't as good a fit as it is with Rooney. Müller is a way better fit on the wings though. Both really are incredible versatile and deserve a lot of credit for it. Brilliant players to have in the team.

3142~~~
Rooney's been great in the midfield role, but it's not a new thing, it's not some magical role newly found for him.

SAF tried playing him there and he as well as previous players have all said he can be effective there and it might be where his future his but Rooney threw a fit and was unhappy and wanted to be stuck back up at CF again.

Maybe now with the armband and/or the additions of RVP and Falcao he feels more obliged to accept the role?

3143~~~
His passing and positioning along with Mata have been brilliant first half.

3144~~~
Covered every blade of grass on the pitch, he's playing an absolute blinder.

3145~~~
Absolute workhorse in midfield. Love the fact he went all the way back to block townsends shot (although unsuccessfully).

Really influential in his current position and it goes hand in hand with his captaincy. Hopefully he has a goal in him today.

3146~~~
He's having average game, good defensively but very average with the ball, and that first touch for the chance was awful.

3147~~~
He is distributing it very well, brilliant half from Wayne. Shame he couldnt get that touch, he'd certainly score.

3148~~~
he's gonna score today, I can feel it <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3149~~~
He's really winning me over in the middle. Shows how much we've been missing a true energetic box to box player.

3150~~~
Not sure why as he's a better striker than either of them. But who cares when he's playing this well - he's the engine of our team.

3151~~~
If Rooney was on the end of the chances Falcao, Rvp and Mata missed today, we'd have won this comfortably.

3152~~~
Really good first half, but we miss him so much upfront. Hopefully a midfielder is fit for Stoke.

3153~~~
This.

If the others aren't on it, Rooney needs to go back up front. Rooney is a goalscorer. Even when Rooney's touch is off and the rest of his game is in the drain he scores goals.

3154~~~
Get another midfielder fit and put Rooney up top instead of Falcao. Not that he isn't playing well in midfield, we just desperately need him up front as he's the only player on the team how knows where the goal is at the moment. That said, his short passing game surprised me today, very good and intelligent. He dropped off in the final 30 minutes along with the rest of the team, but considering the circumstances we can't hold that against him.

3155~~~
True.

3156~~~
He was on the end of one of them, unfortunately his first touch let him down.

3157~~~
Did a lot of work and got deeper and deeper as Carrick tired, I'm loving the late runs he is making into the box from this #8 role.

3158~~~
He's had his chance when Mata picked him and he's had all the time and space in the world to score but his first touch failed him and he was trying to set up Falcao.

Not much to complain about other than that, wasn't on fire like he was the last match, was a bit too much frustrated nearing the end, liked that he was complaining to this cnut ref all the time.

3159~~~
Thought he was class today, especially first half. Him and Mata dominated the midfield in front of Carrick, just a shame he wasn't on the end of one of those chances and that his first touch let him down a bit that one time he was almost in.

3160~~~
Decent game today. Made some really nice delicate passes and runs in behind. Was always going to be hard to top his performances against Newcastle, though.

I just feel if we want to get Rooney into more goalscoring positions, Mata, although he's been excellent in the last couple of games, has to be replaced by a box to box midfielder who's defensively sound. Doing this will give Rooney the freedom to get into the box and make runs in behind, knowing he's got someone behind him that can cover.

3161~~~
Excellent in the first half. Ok to bad in the 2nd.

I'd still say he's playing too deep.

3162~~~
Thought he was invisible today. Didn't really notice him much apart from when he was defending or took that header.

3163~~~
Hm, strange opinion. 
He was everywhere today, esp in the 2nd half. 

With possibly Fellaini or Herrera being fit for stoke we need him up front though.

3164~~~
I thought he was very good today.  A little "invisible" in the second half, though that is true of most our squad.  He puts in a shift, that is for sure.

3165~~~
Could be. I was in a bit of a drunken stupor while watching the match. So wasn't concentrating a 100%.

3166~~~
He definitely spent more time and had more touches in our box than the opposing one

3167~~~
Fergie was trying to turn him into a midfielder before he retired and he was right. Rooney is in the best form he has been in for a few seasons. It's understandable he had a little fatigue today. Watching him in midfield is like having Scholes back only a version Scholes who can defend a lot better

3168~~~
Less times than you seem to think. Ronaldo played up front at United no more than 10-15 times and only in the really big games when Fergie needed 5 defensively astute players and one superstar up front. The 1 up front was always going to be Ronaldo in that scenario.

I don't know why it became fact that Rooney played wide consistently that season. Maybe those making that assumption mainly watched United in the Champions League that season. Maybe it was driven by those who had deigned Rooney a better prospect than Ronaldo and needed an excuse when that was clearly not the case. But Rooney mainly played up front that season - just not very well.

3169~~~
This season he's been playing alongside Robin Van Persie, Juan Mata, Radamel Falcao and Angel Di Maria. 

And for a player who had apparently shot his bolt 3 years ago, has he not looked as good as any of them?

I always think, when it comes to Rooney, that Fergie's 'the cow in the next field always seems better than your cow' allegory <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/rooney-is-out-poll.397103/page-6#post-16565903">rings true</a>.

3170~~~
Ronaldo played up front for us less than 10 times but Rooney played out wide far more often than that because it was Tevez as the sole striker rather than Ronaldo.

3171~~~
Pushed out for Tevez to the wing, just to play 4-3-3 - which Ronaldo absolutely thrived in.

3172~~~
He's got one hell of a leap on him from a standing jump, winning headers for fun today.

3173~~~
He is still our best striker and we miss his goals. 

As soon as Herrera is back, we should drop Forlan .... hmmm Falcao, I mean... and use Rooney as a striker.

3174~~~
I love to watch him play football right now, he's been amazing in midfield.

3175~~~
I think those hoping for Rooney to play as a striker are going to be desperately disappointed, he looks to me like he's enjoying his current role and I think LvG likes having his Captain in the midfield, not to mention he's the only player we have with power who can go box to box.

I felt in the second half he took on the responsibility of playing deeper to help Carrick who looked spent by 60 minutes. He's doing everything you want of a Captain and developing into this role with more variety in his passing and the timing of those late runs into the box.

3176~~~
Indeed I think it would be interesting to see a diamond with Carrick as the anchor, Herrera and Fellaini in the middle with mata in front, and Di Maria and Rooney as our two strikers. On paper, at least, I think this is our most dangerous team.

3177~~~
I think Rooney's workrate and development in the #8 role will see LvG keep him where he is, Di Maria is also better from deeper as I don't think goal scoring has ever been his biggest strength, he's better driving from deep. Right now I think we are missing a piece in attack.

3178~~~
I never thought he'd make a good centre midfielder but he's really performing well there.

3179~~~
We need him upfront. Those other two lads just aren't as convincing as him in front of goal.

3180~~~
I agree with <a class="username" data-user="48107, @Devil may care" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48107/">@Devil may care</a> we won't see Rooney playing up front any time soon. Looks to me like Van Gaal is committed to playing him in midfield. Though it'll be interesting to see what he does if he has good options like Di Maria and Blind available and strikers are out. Even then i could see him playing Wilson up front ahead of him and making space for Rooney in midfield.

3181~~~
Not very good today for the most part. Lots of huffing and puffing, but no real quality on the ball. 

But then a lovely pass for Di Maria to put the game to bed, showing that the link-up between the two is definitely something to look forward to.

3182~~~
I think he has gone of the boil a bit lately. Needs a bit of a rest. His passing has been pretty average in the last 2 games. Just don't want him to burn out to early. Not LVG's fault though, we have no bloody CM's.

3183~~~
Been poor since the Newcastle game. Lovely ball for Di Maria's goal though.

3184~~~
He shouldn't be tired having a rest every CL week and missing 3 games because of his red card in october.

3185~~~
4th game in 9 days, and he's played 90 minutes in all of them (if I remember correctly). Probably has something to do with it.

3186~~~
He badly needs some rest, his form has been poor, shit game today.

3187~~~
It's not the accumulation of games over the season to date that might be causing tiredness. It's playing 4 of them in 9 days, 3 of which were away from home. That has to be exhausting for even the fittest players.

3188~~~
Not sure it works that way.

3189~~~
Oh, had no idea that he played 90 mins in all the games during that time so that probably explain that he's not had the best of games today. Should be fresh next week with 7 days to Southampton game.

3190~~~
Wasn't at his best today and against Stoke everyone was pretty poor but apart from that he's been in really good form actually. Don't think he's tired, just a couple of bad team performances and he was just part of that.

3191~~~
He looked exhausted towards the end. Could barely break into a jog whenever he had the ball.

3192~~~
Effort wise I thought he was alright today. He seemed to cover a lot of ground, made a few clearances in our box etc it's just his concentration seemed well off and nothing seemed to be coming off for him and you could nearly see the frustration growing on his face. A rest might be no harm now.

3193~~~
He's not a central midfielder. Stop playing him as one, for feck's sake.

3194~~~
I've made comments in the past about Rooney's bottom level being very noticeably bad. Today was one of those days where he is playing at his "bottom level".

3195~~~
Another poor performance. A great, match winning game vs Newcastle is the anomaly amongst turgid displays vs Villa, Spurs, Stoke and Yeovil. Fatigue is a caveat that can excuse poor positioning at times but it cannot excuse his wastefulness on the ball. Simple passes going awry is a worry for any player

He needs to address this form. Perhaps Angel Di Maria's return can lead to him having a rest for a game before he takes Mata's place again.

Lastly, an assist today should not mask the fact it was the only pass he could make in that situation and it was an easy hoof into space at that.

3196~~~
Definitely. We need to play him upfront, if not only for the reason that any strike partnership without Rooney in it suddenly becomes less than the sum of its parts.

3197~~~
Should have given him a rest today, played a lot of games lately. Poor performance, but a great assist.

3198~~~
Not a great game from Rooney today, but showed his quality with the ball he played to Di Maria.

3199~~~
He's been playing out of position and it shows. 

That last paragraph is nonsense, by the way.

3200~~~
Yeah, I was referring to his last 2-3 games too.

3201~~~
It when you see sentences like that one - the pass was an 'easy hoof into space' - that you can reasonably assume there's an agenda afoot. 

Because it was blatantly a well timed, well placed and well executed through ball to create a goal scoring opportunity. But some are just reluctant to give Rooney any credit, hence the contortions.

3202~~~
He's also average against 10-man Villa and Spurs.

3203~~~
Not quite. Just an expectation for a player of his calibre to complete a pass into 40 yards worth of space for Di Maria to run into. Even on a poor day.

3204~~~
I never associate Rooney with looking tired no matter how many games he plays, but maybe this new role has taken more out of him since it's adding more work to an older player. His passing today was almost as bad as Fletcher's, in fact there wasn't much to split him, Fletcher and Herrera for sloppiness with the simple passes, it was why we couldn't get any momentum.

3205~~~
Him and Mata were our 2 best players against Spurs and he was definitely our best player against Villa. He's had 2 below par games, no need to go and change history and saw the others were bad because he didn't score in them.

3206~~~
Wrong. Was our best player in that game if I recall. Quick look at his stats, 111 touches, 94% passing, and everyone was saying he played really well after that game.

3207~~~
It wasn't just a forty yard pass into space though, was it? It was a curled forty yard pass that fell perfectly into Di Maria's running stride, and which took the defender that was marking him out of the game. Rooney had to spot it, then he had to execute it. He did both, hence it being a very good pass-cum-assist, as even the people who are saying he didn't play well are conceding.

3208~~~
Which one? against 10-man Villa? Maybe our best player, but still looked average (to me). Everyone's complaining about lack of creativity after that game. We only played a bit better toward the end when Herrera was on.

3209~~~
Looked unfit today, just casually jogged about, poor touches, too many simple passes when he could be pushing the team forward and just takes too long to distribute the ball sometimes. The pass at the end was good, but come on, hardly a worldie. He's been average to poor in each game since Newcastle which is a shame as he was starting to look pretty good again.

3210~~~
Most of his passes are backwards, he doesn't look ahead of play enough. Part of the problem for our slow build up right now.

3211~~~
He just wasn't arsed today against League One team. Simple as that.

3212~~~
He was overall England Rooney.

3213~~~
It was a good pass. One you'd expect him to make. I still class it as an easy hoof for a player of his calibre given the space available to play it into. I fail to see your gripe here. I've merely commented that it shouldn't mask over the performance which some have thankfully not done from reading a few posts here.

3214~~~
I would agree that one good pass doesn't make a summer, and have said it was a poor performance from Rooney (while putting that into the context of this being his 4th full 90 minutes in just 9 days).

But you initially said the assist was 'an easy hoof into space', and that is far from being the case. Called out on it, you are now conceding that it was actually a 'good pass' - and there is a world of difference in tone between calling his ball into Di Maria an 'easy hoof' and calling it a 'good pass'.

3215~~~
Poor game today, but he simply isn't a midfielder. Should be playing in the front 2.

3216~~~
He's played the last 5(?) games in midfield and is still our joint top highest scorer. Should be played further up the pitch. Hope this isn't a permanent switch to midfield.

3217~~~
No, just the inconsistent Rooney we will see if he's to play week in, week out as a midfielder. 

A disgraceful waste of one of the best finishers in world football.

3218~~~
Should be up front on his own in a 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 but there we are...

3219~~~
The White Pele <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Looked like a Yeovil player.

3220~~~
Even when Rooney has a poor game like he had today, he works his arse off and then comes up with the goal/assist like he did today. Wonderful ball to Di Maria.

3221~~~
Was extremely poor today but still managed to come up with a decent assist. 

He really does have a very low bottom level when he struggles with his touch and passing but you can never bet against him making an impact on the score sheet. Not the most consistent of players game in game out but an incredibly productive and as such a valuable player to have.

Needs a rest though.

3222~~~
Needs to play upfront or behind the striker. He is one of the most potent finishers the league has seen.

3223~~~
He certainly did not work his arse off today. He just casually jogged about all game.

3224~~~
True. He looks quite sluggish and slow. It'd be good if he got some bench time to recuperate himself, especially since he's played so much in the past couple of weeks.

His touch, passing, positioning, and movement were quite sloppy, particularly in the first half. In the second half, he improved in keeping possession of the ball, but he was still quite slow, overall. The pass to di Maria for the 2nd goal was beautifully executed, however, and it shows that he still has that world class quality in him even if he's not having a good match.

3225~~~
True. I just dont see hin as a midfielder. Its not enough to do a couple of great diagonal passes

3226~~~
He was playing Yeovil. He should have been able to play in any position without looking as out of sorts as he did. I'd chalk this match up to bad form and nothing more. It's not one you should use to call time on his future as a midfielder.

3227~~~
He's just not a central midfielder. Credit where it's due for being versatile enough to give it a go but if Van Gaal is determined to persist with this experiment indefinitely it would be the most absurd managerial decision I've seen in 30+ years following this club.

3228~~~
He was really sloppy today. Seemed mentally tired. He's played a lot of football in a short space of time over the past couple of weeks and keeping up the level of concentration needed can be tough. A weeks rest should do him good. We will need him at  his best for Southampton.

3229~~~
He's a striker - he should never, <i>ever</i> be judged while playing as a midfielder, because he isn't one.

It's credit to how good a footballer he is that he can blag it as a midfielder, but he isn't one. He's a brilliant, brilliant striker, and if he were being played as one we'd be in a better way as a team.

I personally hold the somewhat controversial opinion that some of our top players might have 'game time' written into their contracts and this is why we're seeing this odd set up of shoe-horning Rooney, RvP and Falcao (<i>3 strikers!</i>) onto the pitch at pretty much all times from a manager that throughout his whole career has had a preference for playing 1.

3230~~~
Looks exhausted after the Christmas games, give him a week off and he will be fine

3231~~~
Yeah, this is definitely England Rooney; poor display yet has one moment of greatness leading to an assist/goal.

3232~~~
Like many have said.....he isn't a CM

3233~~~
He is not a CM and he is tired.

He needs a rest and some games upfront.

3234~~~
That's our captain.

3235~~~
Our (slight) recent dip in performances have IMO been a result of a bit of poor form of Rooney and Carrick.

3236~~~
I really want him to break the our goalscoring record, so the sooner he moves out of midfield, the better. Ideally, he'd be a lone front man, but I just don't know how we're going to do it with the current personnel. I'd love to see a formation where Mata, Herrera and ADM are all feeding <i>just</i> Rooney, no Falcao, no RVP, no Wilson. Just Rooney. He'd score for fun. However, it seems unlikely that LVG will drop not one, but two guys earning 200k a week. Meh.

Just imagine the football this team could produce:

Good Lord Almighty. Herrera and Di Maria just floating around, doing whatever they want.

3237~~~
He is our best player this year.

He was our best player last year.

He was our second best player the year before. 

He is our best player of the past 10 years.

3238~~~
I always thought Rooney in CM was an exiting idea, because he ticks all the boxes (almost). He has a great engine, he can tackle and he has a superb range of passing. Still, i fear you are right though. Time and time again, he has shown his very best when playing as a striker

3239~~~
That's bullshit (the post you're responding to)

3240~~~
very true.

once in a while it is okay for him to be in midfield but 4 or 5 consecutive matches there you can see he is easily running out of ideas now.

he is a striker and will always be.

3241~~~
Actually, expected him to play the no.10 role yesterday with Mata out (The role which Mata had been playing). I wonder why he kept playing left midfield, rather than him pushing a little more forward and Herrera a little deeper.

3242~~~
I wonder if part of the issue is that LvG likes two #8's in his systems and Rooney doesn't want to play as a pure #9 it seems as he likes to be more involved.

3243~~~
And? Last year our captain wasn't arsed to help the team fighting for top 4 when we had the worst season in PL era and just decided that he will leave us on a free transfer. On top of that he told the media he is leaving mid-season and distanced himself from what was happening to us.

To much is spoken about he is captain and should do that and this. The truth is he underestimated our opponent and didn't give all he could in that game but he was not the only one who didn't. He is stil probably our most important player and the one who is leading by example in most games.

You should probably watch other games from yesterday.For example all City players were not arsed until second half.

3244~~~
I guess my vision of seeing him in a counter attacking and interchanging front 3 will never happen.

There was a compilation of his best 100 goals in this thread and the amount of goals he has scored on the counter is amazing. Definitely the best British counter attacker I've seen.

3245~~~
I think he's done alright considering he's also played all bar 12 minutes of our last 6 games in just 21 days. 528 minutes. 

He's looked much better when his partner performed though. A fatigued Carrick or Fletcher give him a lot of running to do. He's much better when he can time his running better and use his energy efficiently.

3246~~~
I thought he was not good enough for his last 2/3 games. He was magnificent against Newcastle and great first half against Spurs, but he runs too much in this position and probably played too much recently.

I think that we need him higher on the pitch, and his inter playing with Mata and Herrera is very interesting but we desperatly lack pace with them.

3247~~~
The question is who will be dropped if he moves forward, looks like it would be rather Falcao than RvP. Nevertheless, I'd prefer to see him play as a striker

3248~~~
Completely wasted in midfield. A couple goals / assists don't hide how unsuited he is in the middle of the park. He's a world class  striker on his day and that's where he should play.

3249~~~
Surprised he wasnt rested yesterday. Getting a lot of football at the moment, 90 minutes in most games every 3 days will take its toll. Not that its looking that way. But against Southampton we need him to be at it, as they have a really solid midfield. 

Hopefully he's not tired. But will need a rest at some point not too far away. But as LVG said in pre-season ''his captain plays 90 minutes''

3250~~~
He played wonderfully just recently in midfield. He can do the job there, hardly completely wasted. Though, I do also believe he's much more useful up front.

3251~~~
Yep, he’s hit and miss in midfield, but that’s to be expected as his best position is up front. If Rooney continues to play in midfield I’ll be concerned that he is only playing there to ensure that he is in the team. LVG needs to start playing players in their best positions, if that means dropping certain players then so be it. He has said many times that the team comes first, it’s about time he showed us that in his team selection.

3252~~~
Team selection and in the transfer windows. When you sign a player with Falcao's profile, the intention is obviously to start him. Thrown in Van Persie and Rooney (who would both be expected to start games) and you're stuck with three strikers competing for two (arguably one) slot. Van Gaal created a rod for his own back the moment he agreed to sign Falcao.

3253~~~
....after spending the summer complaining about a lack of balance in the squad.

3254~~~
The whole thing stinks of a manager who's always worked with a DoF being led by the nose by a new CEO who felt he had a point to prove and got ideas above his station.

3255~~~
Actually his balance complaint was about too many number 10s playing behind the striker, not too many strikers. If you see Rooney as a number 10 then (pre-Falcao) our options at number 9 were RvP & Wilson.

3256~~~
Fairly sure, he complained about having too many strikers and too many #10's in the summer. He played Rooney exclusively as a striker until QPR after which he hasn't played there.

3257~~~
Going into the season with Rooney RVP and Wilson as the strikers wouldn't have been wise. Especially with Wilson being an unproven talent.

EDIT: Hernandez wanted out and he didn't rate Wellbeck as he said. Also Will Keane had his chance in preseason and LVG said he wasn't ready

3258~~~
He may have said something elsewhere, but I definitely remember the four number 10s quote, since we were all trying to figure out who he counted as a number 10.

3259~~~
Yeah it seems that way, it leads to me believe that Falcao was not a van Gaal signing, but a Woodward one.

3260~~~
Yeah I remember that, Rooney, Mata, Herrera and Januzaj I believe was mentioned on here.

3261~~~
Kagawa would also have been included in the "too many number 10s" comment in pre-season.

Still, it's obvious to everyone that Rooney can also play as a 9. It's certainly less of a stretch to adjust to that role than it is to ask him to play in central midfield.

Van Gaal's early season comments about Rooney not having what it takes to play as a striker ring particularly hollow when you consider the performances of RvP, Wilson and Falcao in that role ever since (for different reasons, obviously). As it turns out, Rooney is joint highest scorer despite being mainly played in the deepest role out of all of them. Go figure.

3262~~~
Woodward certainly benefited an awful lot more from our summer than the team did. People were calling for his head right up to the final few weeks of the window and then he pulls the galactico-lite signings out of the bag...

3263~~~
why cant we play him upfront <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3264~~~
Rooney did struggle quite a bit in central midfield. It's as if he's at his best playing more of a goalscoring role than a playmaking one. Him dropping deep to receive the ball seems to be more down to him wanting to be involved in play and bringing the ball forward. If he's told to play as a central midfielder, he restricts his movement and positioning quite a bit and rarely drifts around vertically. His vision and technique isn't good enough for him to play as a central midfield playmaker. He's much better suited to playing a more goalscoring role regardless of what position he takes up on a formation on the paper.

His style, attributes, and skill set all indicate that he's best in a goalscoring role with a striker ahead of him. He hasn't consistently played well as a leading striker since the 2009/10 season, and as a leading striker, he struggles when there aren't any other goalscorers around him who can make runs beyond him (see Everton away last season). Even this season, against Swansea at home and Southampton away, he has struggled when playing up front like a leading striker when not given the freedom to drop back, drift around, and get involved. He can't play as a proper #9 like Falcao or van Persie of today, but he can do well as a 9.5 beside a proper #9 or with a goalscorer or two in the team (Herrera, di Maria, and/or Mata).

3265~~~
Rooney is clearly not a midfielder, although the man deserves praise for filling in nobly.

The problem is "three striker/two slots".  Now that Mata and Herrera are both fit, and Carrick and Di Maria are in good form, Louis needs to decide between RvP or Falcao for any particular match.

If he perseveres with a back 3, this:

De Gea
Back 3 plus whoever is fit for wingback duty
Carrick
Herrera (or Mata) Di Maria
Rooney RvP (or Falcao)

I'm not a big fan of the 352 for all the reasons others have discussed.  So if we go back four then this:

De Gea
Back four (problem at RB with Rafael out again)
Herrera Carrick Di Maria
Rooney Mata
RvP (or Falcao)

Rooney and Di Maria will roam wherever they wish to roam.  With their experience and guile I would trust them to get it right and not abandon their defensive duties.

We don't need to win every single game.  We're out of the hunt for the prem trophy but third place is definitely within reach and it would almost take an epic collapse to drop down to fifth place by season's end.  So now would be a perfect time -- before we meet Chelsea and City again in April -- to experiment with different formations to see if we can improve on our dire form in the 352 formation.

3266~~~
And you honestly think I hold the merceneries at City as benchmark for how players should behave?

3267~~~
Especially given his reluctance to bench RVP. I don't have a huge problem with signing Falcao (although it does smack of Woodwardian dick-swinging,) but playing Wayne Rooney, one of the best strikers in the world, out of position is just mind-boggling.

3268~~~
Hes not the first manager to play him in midfield though tbh, there must be something in it.
Also LVG mentioned he couldn't bench RVP earlier in the season because Falcao wasn't fit enough.

3269~~~
I really want to see that. Send Falcao back( I don't think we need another poacher style striker), and RVP can be rested for some games.  Play it against a minnow team and completely batter them
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3270~~~
I have no doubt Wayne Rooney can be an effective midfielder (or even a decent winger, as he was towards the end of Ronaldo's time,) but he's a top 5 striker (in my opinion,) so why in the hell wouldn't you play him there? As for the second point, then why not play Rooney up front on his own, ala 2009-10? Perhaps with Mata playing just behind him?

3271~~~
I think Rooney played up top in a few games and the gaffer wasn't impressed, he said as much. I would prefer him up top too tbh.

3272~~~
Yeah I guess we'll just have to trust LVG's judgement on this one.

3273~~~

I think he's been brilliant. Gets box to box. Defending incredibly well. Still manages to break. He's never going to be a brilliant playmaker but I honestly think we're getting the best out of him, given that we have better strikers

3275~~~
Well said.

3276~~~
Who are these better strikers? I haven't seen much coming from RvP or Falcao in the past 5 months that makes me think they are better options up top than Rooney. He has done pretty well in midfield for sure, but I also really liked his last games for England where he played in a very fluid front 3 with Welbeck and Sterling, that is what we should be building towards IMO, Rooney in a front 3 not as a CM or a loan #9.

3277~~~
He's either got a long term future in CM, or he's completely wasted. Make your bloody minds up lads.

3278~~~
Do we have better strikers? RVP - although he has improved, has been inconsistent, Falcao has yet to really get into the groove, and Wilson is a kid developing. So, no we do not really have better strikers.

3279~~~
Whether or not we rate him there I think we're likely to see him in midfield for the remainder of the season, the squad is still unbalanced and will take another couple of windows to rectify. I still want us to go 4-3-3 with Rooney as the striker, using van Persie a little more sparingly.

3280~~~
saying this again. he can play in midfield for the home games.. liverpool and newcastle were 2 examples how he did well there, making those late runs into the box as we are expected to dominate more at OT.

however, recent away matches at villa, spurs, stoke and even yeovil, we are not dominating much thus rooney will spend most of the time in his own half and which obviously did not suit his game at all.

3281~~~
I think he's only playing there as much because our other box to box options are so lightweight, and it's making his role too defensive as well as he's the one being more disciplined positionally than Mata or Herrera.

3282~~~
Bit of a change from my captain always plays 90 minutes.

Asked about Rooney's selection by MUTV, Van Gaal said: 'It’s dependable on how the balance in the team is. I need balance in the team. I’m looking for the balance. 

'I hope to perform better because then the game shall be more attractive. I don’t know if I shall use him always because it’s also dependable of the form of the strikers. 

'He’s also a very good striker so I can use him on different positions and I like that because I like multi-functional players. I normally buy more multi-functional players than specialists.'

Van Gaal went on to proclaim his interest in developing the younger generation at Old Trafford.

'I have had the time to know all my players,' he continued. 'That’s another exciting time because that’s why I became a manager. 

'I want to work with young people. It keeps you young and you can make a team out of it. Now we are still building up and in the process.'

3283~~~
The penny might be dropping. Thank feck.

3284~~~
Yep! 

Hopefully, when Felliani returns (I never thought I would ever say that!) and obviously Blind, then Rooney will either be the striker, or behind the front 2 again... please!

3285~~~
I wouldn't even be too happy with that. Mata's been our best player in his last two appearances IMO.

3286~~~
Rooney needs to be upfront. Its not other midfielders accommodating for Rooney, its Rooney who is having to accommodate for RvP and Falcao. And neither have been good enough to continue their warrant upfront.

3287~~~
Rooney's best position for me is behind the striker, but I think our current crop of strikers might not be most suitable for him, or at least van Persie isn't. I would like to see him for few games behind Falcao to see if they might compliment eachother (altough, Falcao didn't show much to warrant a place in starting XI for me, but it's not like van Persie is great either).



I think he means "I don't know if I shall use him always - <i>as a midfielder...</i>"

3288~~~
Agreed, he seemed pretty categorical at the start that his captain always plays, if there is a change it is more likely to be in where than whether he fits him in.

3289~~~
We have better 9s. If someone in here said Rooney was a better 9 (not 10) than falcao 18 months ago he would have been perma banned

3290~~~
Lets not go into specifics here, you said strikers. We really do not do we? He's currently joint top goal scorer with RVP whilst Falcao has 3 and Wilson has zero. He also has more assists than RVP, so Rooney has been our best so far this season. If he weren't playing in midfield mostly so far, he would probably have had more goals. The fact he has scored as much as RVP playing mostly in a deeper role show's your opinion up to be honest.

3291~~~
Right now... no, we don't have better 9s. If we played Rooney as a 9, he would be better than the current RVP or Falcao or Wilson.

3292~~~
Based on when hes played as a 9 this season that might not actually be true (not saying it isn't)

3293~~~
How I miss the good ol' day when our striker can give consistently good (occasionally brilliant) performance week in week out. Now we have one that started to show that, and he's been dropped to CM for the other two who only there based on reputation alone.

I used to 'despise' Rooney's consistentsy, but these other two are even worse.

3294~~~
I think its harsh to blame rvp and falcao when we just knock the ball around our 5 defenders for 90 minutes. They're on the move all the time but we're not allowed pass it forwards until a team has 11 men behind the ball

3295~~~
Yeah, but the Falcao on display right now isn't exactly the same one from his Atletico days. RVP also isn't what he used to be. So I would say that Rooney probably is our best number 9 at the moment. For me, it's his best position - he was fantastic there in 2009-10.

3296~~~
Based on what though? You are basing it off a season in 09/10? He's been as inconsistent as RVP this season.

3297~~~
Full disclosure: I haven't been able to see all the games this season. How many times has Rooney started up (in the number 9 position)? Genuine question, as I really don't know.

3298~~~
That's not what I'm saying though. Where is the evidence that Rooney would be a superior number 9, other than his stats up there almost 5 years ago. RVP is our most consistent scorer in the past 2 and a half seasons. Fergie obviously didn't see Rooney as an out an out number 9 either considering he barely played him there.

3299~~~
But I sometimes wonder if Rooney's versatility works against him. Once Chicharito, and then RVP came in, perhaps Fergie felt he could get maximum effect from playing Rooney a bit behind, a position he has also excelled in. All I'm saying, is the one time I truly thought Rooney was a top-5 player in the world was when he played that position in the year after Ronaldo left. I've always wanted to see him back there, but like you said, Fergie and LVG seem to think he's best utilized elsewhere.

3300~~~
His versatility certainly does, because when he's playing deeper his inconsistent form hurts the team more than him playing up front away from the heart of our play. I really dislike seeing him deep in midfield because he doesn't offer us enough there. Keeps things too simple and slows our attacks down. I'd much prefer him off a main striker but that probably wont happen anytime soon. He has racked up alright stats this year, but then he's always been like that hasn't he?

3301~~~
As well, even though he's quite inconsistent, the one aspect of his game that is relatively reliable is his finishing. So even on an off-day, I'd back him to bury a half-chance; whereas he can be a liability playing further back when his passing radar and his touch is off.

3302~~~
I agree with this. In fact, if Van Gaal wants to play both RVP and him, I'd rather Rooney be the 9, with RVP dropping deep. Rooney's finishing has been more consistent than Van Persie this season.

3303~~~
His annual inconsistency is back.

3304~~~
4 games of shite since Newcastle. So annoying seeing him stroll around in midfield. He's not very good there!

3305~~~
He was crap but he's not a midfielder and he's been run into the ground over Christmas.

3306~~~
Why on earth wasn't he taken off instead of RVP? Rooney seems to be the only undroppable one no matter how bad he is playing.

3307~~~
Why in the world of feck is he a)playing every game with no rest b)playing as a fecking cm?

Brainless from Van Gaal.

3308~~~
Been said before but for a supposed top player his bottom level is shocking, I see a a better standard at my 5 a side weekly league, and those players pay a fiver to play every week, they don't receive 300k.

3309~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

<a class="username" data-user="21966, @UnofficialDevil" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/21966/">@UnofficialDevil</a> and others who I can't remember.

3310~~~
He looked tired. Shouldn't have been with a week off between games. 

Needs to step it up again.

3311~~~
I do not know why Di Maria and Rooney did not just switch positions.

3312~~~
He's been terrible for a while now so today wasn't a surprise. Hollywood passing or not he'll never be a midfielder. Not a good enough one anyway.

3313~~~
Never a midfielder. Play him upfront. Drop RVP if necessary or better yet, ditch the 5 man defence and go with 2 upfront in a 4-4-2.

3314~~~
Should be upfront. We have enough fecking CMs now.

3315~~~
Not a midfielder. The blame goes to Louis for insisting that he plays there. No excuse for shit passing and offering nothing though. 

Didn't receive much service up front due to our lump ball tactics.

3316~~~
Are you like...happy or something?

3317~~~
But hey hey hey, he is our best player, captain elect, someone who can't wrong no matter what he does and has the same goalscoring record as Aguero since the latter joined the PL.

3318~~~
At the result? Of course not.

At being right? Always.

3319~~~
But you're still wrong.

3320~~~
He's had more good games than bad games this season, but was poor today in midfield that performed abysmally.

3321~~~
Ok.

3322~~~
Up there with one of the worst performances of the season. Again. This belief that he has been amazing needs to stop. He played well vs Newcastle but that has been it really as a midfielder since the Villa game for me. 

Looked very fatigued and I would drop him from the next match. Passes were poor all game long. He had the opportunity to make so many final balls and failed so badly so often. 

Mata was moving and offering options to Valencia, Rooney was not and left Shaw too often. He also let play go on around him without any drive, again a fitness or fatigue issue perhaps.

Sorry if this ruffles feathers but I'm allowed to voice an unpopular opinion.

3323~~~
Waste of a player in midfield.

3324~~~
He's more Stevie Me than Paul Scholes when played in midfield.

3325~~~
He's lost some of the strikers instinct IMO.Even in the last 10 he was hovering too deep. He has all the tools to be a top striker again, clearly he needs more game time as the main forward.

3326~~~
His passing has always been inconsistent and his movement off the ball in midfield just isn't up to scratch. Puzzles me how some believe this is his future; particularly when he's so bloody good in front of goal.

3327~~~
Needs to get back up top or to the bench, he isnt a good enough midfielder but he's by far our best striker.

3328~~~
Clearly this is essential because we don't have anybody else to do that job....

3329~~~
I prefer Rooney to RvP. Rooney doesn't get bogged down to the point it's like having 10 men. He will keep trying. Not going to discuss Falcao as there always seems to be something going on with him.

3330~~~
Nope you aren't the only one. I said exactly the same thing in Matchday and got pissed all over by some child called SqueakyWeasel for being a Rooney hater.

3331~~~
Well, yeah, we don't.

3332~~~
Also, the ref didn't pick up on any today, but some of the challenges he makes when defending could easily result in a goal. And he does this looping back header into no man's land (between our back 3 and DdG) that puts us under pressure. Doesn't play sensibly, imo.

3333~~~
He isn't a quarter of the midfielder Gerrard was.

3334~~~
That tackle in the first half on Davis was easily a yellow card, right outside the box too. Bit of a naughty one.

3335~~~
He looked angry and confused today, just play him up top for fecks sake. I guess now RvP is injured he might actually get the chance.

3336~~~
It like some people in here can't wait for Rooney to have a bad performance. That said, he certainly wasn't our worst performer today.

3337~~~
Should play every fecking game as striker. Just wasting him in CM. Just like Di Maria btw. 2 of our best players, both being wasted.

3338~~~
He's confused as to why he wanted to leave for playing out of position but now he's captain, and on a big fat salary he's happy to play anywhere, until things stop going his way on the pitch.

3339~~~
Awful today.. Its shame that he is undroppable.

3340~~~
Why is he being played as a f<i>u</i>cking midfielder?

3341~~~
Its alright lads, im taking him out of my fantasy team now so he will return back to to his normal self next week.

3342~~~
It's interesting that LvG used him in midfield once again, when he had Fellaini, Herrera available and at the same time played Di Maria as a striker. He's been decent/good in midfield but I thought it's a temporary solution. Very poor today anyway, he seems allergic to short passing.

3343~~~
He's pretty much same as Gerrard when played in the midfield IMO. People kep praising him but we actually keep playing as shit boring and predictable football.

Attacking wise he can do things that are impressive but actually means nothing for the team. For example, his crossfield passes to Valencia, first of all they are inconsistent, in one game they are Scholesy esque but in next game he keeps failing finding his target, but yet he keeps trying them. Those passes actually make our game predictable, slow our play, and Valencia rarely does anything from them apart from winning the corner.

Defensively, he runs a lot but in reality most of our midfielders runs less but are better defensively than him. Considering how much he covers you would think his defensive numbers are high, but it's actually quite clear even from watching the game that he doesn't intercept much balls nor wins any more duels than some other players. To cover that with numbers, he intercepts 0.9 balls per game, and he is in 14th position by interceptions in our team(Blind, Carrick, Herrera, Fellaini - our all midfielders are all ahead of him, Fletcher is just one spot behind him). Mata is on 0.5.  Tackles wise, he is in 15th position with 1.1 tackle per game. Again, all our midfielders are ahead of him, only Mata from midfielders is behind him, but not by much, he makes 0.9 tackles per game. Compare that with people calling Mata defensive liability and praising Rooney like he is Roy Keane in disguise defensively.

I don't like this stats game too much, but it's nice to see that it backs my opinion of him a s a midfielder and his "extraordinary" defensive game everyone is talking about.

Of course, there are good things with playing him in midfield like his goalscoring abilities, but I think there are too much negatives in this case.

Btw I am not criticseing Rooney, it's not he who plays himself in midfield.

3344~~~
Wasted in midfield and then played up front with Fellaini with our team just hoofing the ball. LVG said Rooney was very happy when playing CM against Newcastle but you can tell he's far from happy playing the position with his post match interview.

RVP doesn't play against Yeovil, we play Wilson and Falcao up front. Falcao doesn't play today, we play RVP and a midfielder up front instead of Rooney. It takes Falcao not playing and an injury to RVP for LVG to play Rooney up front which is quite worrying. Don't see the logic in having your joint highest scorer playing centre mid, especially when he hasn't been good there for a fair amount of games in a row now as well as the alternatives up front not being great.

3345~~~
Whether it be Falcao, RVP and now Rooney, whichever striker hasn't been given a chance up top recently suddenly becomes our best striker. He was no better than RVP when he moved up top. The grass is always greener and all that...

3346~~~
Nah, he's quite clearly a better striker than those two for me, didnt know why he was shifted to midfield, as he began the season quite well.

3347~~~
LVG decided that he didn't like Rooney as a striker and that he felt RVP and Falcao could do the job better, despite being Rooney being our best striker form wise at the time. Although that wasn't saying a lot.

3348~~~
Cannot believe some people mention him and Scholes in the same breath.

edit, exibit a:


Words fail me.

3349~~~
Not a midfielder. This shoehorning of players into positions that they are not best at for the sake of playing them has to stop.

3350~~~
he had a few good games in midfield, but it's probably time to push him further up now, especially if VP is out.

3351~~~
As someone said Wayne looks tired, or is it that LvG said they will be tired after all these games over Christmas. The fact he is playing in the supposed powerhouse of a team, the midfield, when he isn't a midfielder. He needs to be up front. Unfortunately Wayne might also be in the middle of his slumps. You can almost set your watch to them.

3352~~~
Might be an unpopular opinion, but he should either be starting as a striker or not starting at all. He doesn't work as a midfielder.

3353~~~
Like everyone else has said, he is not a CM. Maybe with RvP out he will be moved back up forward.

3354~~~
He is not a midfielder and he is notoriously weak in the second half of the season.  I think he needs a break for a few weeks.

3355~~~
I'd probably give him a break too. But "My captain shall always play." - LvG.

3356~~~
The Rooney project is failing. Rooney is not consistent enough to play every game like sneijder, some games he can do it all but there comes a period where nothing goes right for him. I hope LvG has realised that.

Play him as a 10 behind the striker or 9, that is where he has earned his bread and butter for most of his career.

3357~~~
Play him as a striker or dont play him at all.  He doesn't take on players with his dribbles and bursting runs anymore.  All he does during the game is looking to put cross field passes to the wingbacks. The Moyes syndrome is still in him.

3358~~~
In fact, I would say this is a very popular opinion as far as I can remember. Rooney should be an all and out striker or nothing at all.

3359~~~
Who said that? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3360~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That quote! You'd swear some people never saw Scholes play. 

In his prime, he had everything a midfielder needed. He could do everything that Carrick, Blind, Herrera and Rooney does as midfielder. Scholeas could receive a ball and play it first time on the turn to our strikers, peel off and receive the ball again. He could switch play in an efficient manner, something Rooney has proven time and time again he can't do on a consistent basis. Scholes could also play little one twos, freeing his team mates up. Heck, he even got forward once or twice to score goals. He could do all this, with the added bonus of knowing when exactly to do which one of them.

Basically, the more I see Rooney in midfield, the more I miss Paul Scholes. I mentioned "in his prime" in the last paragraph, but a 36 year old Scholes is a better midfielder than Rooney is currently. Every United manager deserves a Paul Scholes, which is too bad for Moyes and Van Gaal.

3361~~~
Rooney has always been very average in midfield going back a few years when Fergie played him there for a while.

3362~~~
Seeing Barca play and Suarez be dangerous as the 9 on the break reminded me again that before we bought RVP I had no doubt they best move for us was to use Rooney as the 9 and buy quick, technically skilled players to work off of him. Herrera and Di Maria are a good start.

Let Falcao go back to Monaco, sign a great wide attacker and the best CM we can get and we'll be buzzing again with Rooney as our 9.

-----------Rooney--------------------(RVP, Wilson)
-<b>Signing1</b>------------Di Maria------(Mata, Januzaj, Nani)
-----Herrera---<b>Signing2</b>----------- (Di Maria, Mata, Fellaini)
-----------Blind--------------------- (Carrick)
Shaw-------------------------Rafael (<b>Signing 3</b>, Valencia/Young, Blackett)
------Rojo------Smalling----------- (Jones, Evans, McNair)
-----------De Gea------------------- (Valdes)

It's not perfect and we might well need a CB upgrade as well as a 2nd wide starter to let Di Maria play centrally and rotate for 2 spots with Herrera, but this is the basic, normal thing that most continental managers would do with out squad, right? Get another box to box CM to solidify the midfield, give Di Maria freedom even if it means forcing him wide more than he's best used at, play Rooney as the creative 9 who doesn't just clog the middle up and minimize the number of static footballers out there.

3363~~~
We're going to turn him into another Alan smith should we persist on playing him in midfield.

3364~~~
He can be gobshite at times - just utterly rubbish. His passing and time on the ball today are just atrocious. He's so much better playing as a striker.

3365~~~
Not great today, in midfield he gives the ball away far too often and goes for the wrong pass.

3366~~~
Put him back upfront where he needs to be, put di Maria deeper and get Herrera in midfield. It's not even something really hard.

3367~~~
Did a good job refereeing the game today.

Would be nice if he could start playing football again, mind.

3368~~~
We've taken a 30 goal striker and completely blunted him.

His pass to Valencia for the opener was evidence that he should always be stationed at the sharp end of the pitch - brilliant vision.

Why don't we just buy a proper midfielder seeing as we have loadsa money?

3369~~~
Didn't look angry or confused today, just miserable and that turned to sloppiness time and again.

3370~~~
Poor today, but that's understandable HES NOT A F*CKING MIDFIELDER. 

I swear, if Van Gaal keeps playing Rooney in MF and Di Maria as a striker, im going to commit seppuku with a butter knife

3371~~~
The poor streak continues. Newcastle was a clear anomaly. Passing a continual bum note throughout. This must be seen and recorded by LVG and his staff. 

Energy was good today. That has to be commended as it was a concern previously. Needs to be swapped with Di Maria positionally for me now. Let him play alongside Falcao if RVP remains sidelined.

3372~~~
Was shit today.

Email this post to LVG please.

If people from the caf can see this, then it should be fecking obvious.

3373~~~
He was fecking terrible today. Stop trying to be clever and put Rooney up front, Van Gaal.

3374~~~
This x15 billion

3375~~~
Waste of his abilities. Let him focus on making a difference in the final third. 

It's fine for the odd game the way fergie did it but considering him as your main central midfielder, is laughable.

3376~~~
Mixed performance from Rooney today. Made some simple errors (wasn't the only one) but at times, made some really nice passes, i.e., one that led to the first goal. Like many have said, though, get him up top.

3377~~~
So LVG has taken our highest combined scorer/assister and put him in a position where he's not doing either and we're looking worse. What is more worrying is that he has made the position permanent now and we have to look forward to more poor/average performances in midfield from him rather than the guy who was looking like scoring or assisting every game. 

Why is he doing this? Our midfielders are back from injury so I have no idea. Seems like he just wants to boost his own ego by having a player change positions and for it to come off. He thought he was a genius after the Newcastle game but now its clear it isn't working and he's too stubborn to let it go. On this form in midfield, Rooney shouldn't play. Same goes for Di Maria and playing up front.

3378~~~
He can't spot a run to his left, it's like he is blind on the left eye, every pass, every instinct seems to be aimed at the right flank. Curious habit, shares it with Gerrard.

3379~~~
Some of his passing was simply awful today.

3380~~~
He was horrid today.

Play him up front or don't play him at all, simple as. We can see it, LVG can't.

3381~~~
Get ball. Pass to Valencia. Rinse and repeat.

3382~~~
you've got a guy who is quickly closing in on being the top scorer in Man Utd and England history, and we're playing him so deep he has next to no chance to score.


It really is odd. A game or two if need really be, but not every game

3383~~~
MotM simply for not kicking LVG in the nuts

3384~~~
I've noticed that too, it's amazing! Drives me nuts.

3385~~~
Yep. He's a less-genius Totti who's more of an aerial threat. We should surround him with pace and technical skills.

3386~~~
Our most integral player over last 3-4 years in terms of goals and assists, and always consistent in both respects every season, now being pushed into midfiled, makes no sense

As hes not good there, and when you have herrera, di maria, mata, fellaini, blind, carrick why does Rooney have to play out of position?

3387~~~
It goes for his defending also, the number of times QPR were allowed to double up on Blind while Rooney is nowhere to be found was driving me insane.
Agreed.

3388~~~
I can't believe the clueless pundits compare him to Scholes.

He is miles behind Scholes as a midfielder and will never be as good. 

That chance at the end of the first half, where he could have shot, but just passed it straight at the defender summed him up as a midfielder. 

Play him striker.

3389~~~
Thought there would be more posts in this thread. He really was wasteful with possession and poor overall. Clearly not a midfielder and needs to be moved back up front. But will it actually happen? Most likely not.

3390~~~
This.

Anyone comparing Rooney to Scholes is just insulting the Ginger man himself. One thing people need to understand, coaches and pundits alike, is that Rooney is totally useless as a midfielder. Until the very end of his career, Rooney should and must play as a striker.

3391~~~
I'm in the Rooney up front camp but that statement is just wrong. He isn't totally useless in midfield, he has proven he can play well there.

3392~~~
If we talk about ball retention and the ability to make good passes from deeper positions, would you ever ask Didier Drogba, Luis Suarez or Zlatan Ibrahimovic to play in midfield because they have some of those "qualities" to play in midfield? They would be the first to tell their managers to go "F" themselves if something like that happened.

Rooney, like any other striker, is a much bigger threat up front than anywhere deeper. LVG is not helping anybody by playing him in a position where he will never be among the best.

3393~~~
That has absolutely nothing to do with your statement saying he is totally useless in midfield. I agree he should be up front, that's not what I was questioning.

3394~~~
Yeah he's not totally useless there but I'd have herrera or fellaini ahead of him as a midfielder. Rooney should only start if the others aren't fit. It's an insult to our other midfielder to say that a striker in the team is a better midfielder than them.

3395~~~
Based on what I saw of him against QPR combined to the way he performed in the previous 5 matches (after Liverpool), that should be the end of that silly stint in midfield for him. Using Rooney in midfield should only come as a last resort when injuries strike us down hard.

3396~~~
Hoping Rooney plays in his best position, so if he doesn't perform, I can have my usual moaning about him.

Now the moaning of his average performances feels a bit unjustified, because he's clearly not a CM but still work hard on the pitch. Bah..

3397~~~
With all the fecking notes LVG takes, you'd imagine he'd have noted the number of times Rooney has given away the ball or been dispossessed in Midfield. He's not a CM for feckssake! Play him upfront!

3398~~~
Apparently he "hasn't impressed" as a striker apart from the finishing of course.

3399~~~
It has probably something to do with him not being able to act as a targetman which is something LvG requires of his striker and he doesn't have the pace like Di Maria and Wilson for the second striker position.
We have to use him as a #10 then, that will mean Mata getting dropped.

Bit of an issue dropping Rooney since he is the captain and always have to play.

3400~~~
Another poor performance yesterday. That makes it what, 4th or 5th in a row?

3401~~~
When he's this bad, it's hard to remember that he's actually any good. I've never seen any other player with such a disparity between his peak and trough - and the cycle repeats itself every season. He's out of position but that's no excuse: executing basic five yard passes should be independent of positon.

3402~~~
77% pass completion is shite for a CM. He's getting worse and worse at playing a position he shouldn't be playing in the first place. All the more so with Carrick, Blind, Mata, Herrera and Fellaini all fit and available. This absurd experiment needs to stop.

3403~~~
He can have one or two good games as a CM but overall he really isn't one and cannot be expected to have regular decent performances. If LVG wants ADM so badly up front, then play him with Rooney then. At least both of them would have that pace so important to him.

3404~~~
Indeed. And in fact, he can be allowed to get away with such stuff when he's played upfront. Such performances are criminal in midfield though. Especially when the idea is to have a possession based system.

Spot on. For some reason people think he's doing well. He's clearly not, these are bang average performances at best.

3405~~~
Rooney isn't a CM but he isn't that bad either. My two cents: He has tried to prove too much - by being everwhere on the pitch, helping in defence, getting on the end of crosses, becoming our leading goal scorer while plaing as a CM, being an impecable captain, etc. Therefore, he run himself in the ground and now he isn't fresh enough both physically and mentally.

He wouldn't make a significant difference up front. He is more dynamc than RvP but his ability to hold up the ball is limited. Still, he is a striker and should play as a stiker. I'm not sure that he would improve us up front, I'm skeptical about that, <i>but he deserves</i> to get a chance to show what he can contribute as a striker.

3406~~~
If only we had a £30 million midfielder with good movement and passing to play possession football...I can't believe we are watching Rooney play in central midfield after spending so much money in the summer.

3407~~~
Looking at his body language, he seems to be giving that seen before message that he is not happy playing there....

3408~~~
He always says the opposite in his interviews.

3409~~~
Yep. Put him up front and he'd be just as bad. He needs to be dropped/rested; we have plenty of options for his position.

3410~~~
He's a good option to bring off the bench when Radders is tiring.

3411~~~
I think he said in 2013 that he's happy to play there to help out, when we're short of options. But he doesn't want it to become his permanent position at this point in his career. And at the moment, it looks like it might be. So I wouldn't be very surprised if he isn't happy, and that this is affecting his performances.

If the management are then going to say 'But we no longer think you're good enough as a striker or a 10' (which would be rather harsh, considering he's still our joint top scorer even while playing from deep, and Falcao and RvP have hardly been pulling up trees themselves), then that's probably when he gets itchy feet.

'If you no longer feel i'm good enough to start in the position I want to start in, then sell me to a club who do'.

Of course that's the melodramatic interpretation. Another is that he's now club captain, is prepared to shoulder the responsibility of playing out of position, isn't playing well at the moment because no-one is - least of all among our star attackers - and will pick up when the team in general does.

3412~~~
You should check out his current interviews. LvG and Rooney both are willing for the latter to play in the midfield, not because he is a stop gap but because they do think that he would be better in that role. Well, at least according to them, Rooney brings in a kind of physicality which Herrera lacks. That would also explain why Herrera isn't starting and Rooney is still playing CM even though Falcao/RvP aren't really banging in the goals.

3413~~~
Okay, but they're hardly going to say anything different in public, are they?

3414~~~
Get him out of midfield and put him up front.

3415~~~
Either play him up top, or drop him. He's not a midfielder, and he doesn't look particularly happy playing as one (probably angry and confused tbf).

3416~~~
Well he should have left then, considering he was apparently not happy about playing "out of position" under Fergie. It's not like it's the first time this has happened. He seemed fine a while ago but seems like he doesn't know what he wants now, and his performances on the pitch are showing it. Putting him up top wont guarantee better performances either. Funny how when LVG came in Rooney was happy to play anywhere for the manager, coinciding with him getting the captaincy but now he looks as though he's sulking.

3417~~~
I think those two games in two days have drained everything out of him. He played all of those festive fixtures and now just seems below par. It isn't a lack of effort either I iust think he needs a rest. Our next PL game is Leicester on the 31st. Surely we can get past Cambridge without him and give him a week off.

3418~~~
Here's Rooney's exact quote from October 2013 anyway:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/09/wayne-rooney-reasons-leave-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/09/wayne-rooney-reasons-leave-manchester-united</a>

Do we think his attitude towards playing in midfield has changed substantially in the space of a year?

Of course even as a Rooney fan boy, I would argue that it's his job as the well renumerated captain of Manchester United to set an example and just get on with it. Which is what he's been doing, to be fair.

3419~~~
So many assumptions based on nothing.

3420~~~
Well, he did throw a tantrum under Fergie.

3421~~~
Except quotes from Rooney himself? He said in 2013 he was wanting to leave because he wasn't playing upfront, then when LVG came he said he was happy to play anywhere. Wonder if the new contract and captaincy had anything to do with it.

3422~~~
Not publically though. It was Fergie who let slip that he'd apparently asked to leave, rather than Rooney.

3423~~~
He's got a couple of poor games lately, but other than that he was very good playing in midfield and behind the strikers. 

Every time he's played striker this season he was shit, but people keep calling for LVG to play him there because he was amazing 5 years ago. I think his best position is behind the strikers and he showed it every time he played there this season, but LVG prefers to play him in midfield because Mata is doing really good lately and he can't be dropped.

3424~~~
You're just assuming he isn't happy to play there now though and is sulking. He's said nothing of the sort recently. No more than a week ago did I see an interview with him on MUTV saying he's happy to play in midfield.

3425~~~
Here's what Rooney said about playing in midfield in October 2012:



And then have a look at the quotes above from October 2013. It turns out he hadn't actually wanted to play there at all.

3426~~~
I don't care what Rooney said about playing in midfield in 2012. The post I quoted suggested: 
"He seemed fine a while ago but seems like he doesn't know what he wants now, and his performances on the pitch are showing it.... now he looks as though he's sulking."

It's pure assumptions. Anyone want to read the quote about him being happy to play in midfield from last week?

3427~~~
Still a tantrum...

The point remains though. No idea what fruit this experiment would bear though.

3428~~~
He looks like a frustrated player out there. Why wouldn't he be though, considering he chops and changes his mind all the time.

3429~~~
But that's the whole point: he said publicly in October 2012 that he was 'enjoying' his 'new midfield role', then admitted in October 2013 that he hadn't actually wanted to play there at all.

What footballers and managers say in public, and what they actually think, can often be diametrically opposed, because they have to play the P.R. game.

3430~~~
I don't think we're actually disagreeing. My point is that just because Rooney says publicly that he's happy to play in midfield, it doesn't necessarily make it so. He might well be happy to play in midfield, but if so, it means he's had a major change of heart within the space of a year.

3431~~~
Does he? He looks fine to me. A tad tired at the most which is entirely feasible given how much he played over Christmas. You're just making assumptions to suit you're agenda. There is no reason to suggest he is sulking.

I'll provide a little context shall I. Early in the 2012/13 season he was playing in a midfield three with Carrick and Cleverley and was the most attacking midfielder. He posted that tweet after the Newcastle away 3-0 game iirc when he played at the tip of a midfield diamond (with Carrick, Cleverley and Kagawa). 

At the end of the season he was playing in a midfield two next to Carrick. It's entirely feasible that he liked the former and not the latter.

Some of Rooney's behaviour has been annoying at times but to assume he's sulking now about playing in midfield is a bit far-fetched. LvG even said against Aston Villa away he was too defensive so he told him he needs to be more attack minded and get forward more and he did that the next game. I don't think what we are seeing now is anything more than a little tiredness.

3432~~~
I'm not sure but I think he didnt play any games as a striker this season. I may be wrong.



People making thins up again - like he is frustrated, not happy and is sulking.

Nothing new then..

On the other hand, after we've spent some money for midfielders it doesnt make sense that he plays in the midfield. He looked the best as nr. 10 and although Mata has been decent maybe Rooney should be brought back to that position instead of him or of course should be a striker.

3433~~~
Looks like this has turned into pro-Rooney vs anti-Rooney, I don't think it's like that personally, I just think he's sick of spending more time chasing back than he is attacking, and the tireder Carrick gets the more running backwards Rooney is having to do.

The real issue though is that he's not a CM no matter how much he's played there, at best he could play as an AM in a midfield 3, but the stupid thing is he's stuck in the role because we lack any box to box CM's, so our best striker and Captain is not playing in the role where he can help the team the most. He'll still be our first, and maybe only, player to get double figures this season though, but just imagine if he was actually playing as a striker, he'd likely already be there and we might have a few more points.

3434~~~
I don't know if it is or isn't the case. But I would argue it's not far fetched at all, given that just over a year ago he was openly talking about how he didn't want to play there, and how this had affected his performances.

3435~~~
We all know he can't pass 5 yards but I think he's doing okay in the middle, gives us lots of drive and contributes loads defensively. Makes good runs

3436~~~
He played at least 5 games as a striker this season, most recently Soton away.

3437~~~
That's a myth. Energy does not equate to what we need in midfield. Sure he hounds the ball, but he does so in a mindless fashion that makes us lose our shape in midfield. Also, contrary to what you said, he does not make good runs. Hell, he has no idea how to exploit and occupy space that looms large in front of him. Go rewatch our games and you'll find him standing next to Carrick or in line with him, many times unnecessarily standing in a clear passing line between someone else and Carrick asking for the ball. 

All of these would be inexcusable if he was a midfielder by trade. What IS inexcusable though are the basics that he's fecking up such as misplacing simple passes and losing possession. I would go so far as to say that even his lack of intelligence in exploiting space should be questioned; strikers should know how to do that.

3438~~~
Van Gaal probably knows better than you from his 1000s hours in training whether he plays midfield well so I'm not too worried about your sweeping absolute statements

3439~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Yes and look how well that's doing for us. By the way i gave specifics, not sweeping absolutes.

3440~~~
He's scored plenty of goals from midfield this season, a number of them involving well timed runs from deep - quite the feat, when he apparently isn't any good at this.

3441~~~
Really? I can only think of Newcastle and Liverpool. Not being sarcastic but please remind me of more. In any case, he really stifles us in midfield. Anyone can see that.

3442~~~
Newcastle, Liverpool, West Ham, Arsenal - that's 50% of his goals scored via runs from deep.

3443~~~
The point being. We need to play him up front, not in midfield. I am very sure I'm not the only one who'll say that he's not cut out for it. I'm not hating on him; it's not his fault he's not a midfielder being played there but he IS rubbish at it. For many reasons that have been stated many times on this forum.

3444~~~
I don't think he's "not cut out for midfield". I want him to move up front simply because for now, that's where he is best at. 

One day in the future, then I can see him being a midfielder. But he's 3rd in the club's goal-scoring record, he needs to be up there.

3445~~~
He's been really poor in midfield lately. I don't think his passing range is as good as people think it is. For me, he shouldn't be in midfield, at least not at the moment. 

If it was the 90th minute and you had to pick which one of our players had a one-on-one to win the match, who would you pick? Because for me it would be Rooney every time. Against Arsenal, against Newcastle, I was basically celebrating before he even scored. 

I understood wanting pace up front, but putting Di Maria up there and Rooney in midfield is just wrong. Di Maria, running with the ball from those deep central positions, is one of the best players in the world.

3446~~~
I can't stand the *Rooney to Valencia* pass that seems to happen every 2nd time he gets the ball.

3447~~~
If the pass is successful - which they usually are - why can't you stand it?

3448~~~
Support striker or lead striker. Did LVG not watch Rooney destroy his Bayern side in 2010? Did he not see Rooney and Chicharito embarrass Chelsea in 2011? This is really frustrating and almost as bad as watching Di Maria up front.

You can tell Rooney looks lost in this midfield. He is trying to be conservative which is not his instinctual self. The creativity is lost from his game completely because I think he is afraid to lose the ball in bad positions.

Rooney has always been prone to giving it away (like Giggs, Nani and other creative players) because he always tries to unlock the other team. But when he is a striker this doesn't hurt as much because he is further up the pitch.

The no pace argument is bullshit. He is still really fast. Not really fast running with the ball (never has been) but running on the counter attack or getting in behind the defenders or getting on the end of a ball he is still really fast. Speed doesn't just go away at 29.

3449~~~
very true.

as much as i want to see rvp and falcao both starting it is obvious it should be rooney plus one at this moment.

3450~~~
Good post.

I don't mind him playing the odd game in midfield and he's clearly nowhere near as bad there some try to make hm out but it's such a monumental waste of his talent and ability. I don't think Fergie ever played Rooney in CM for as long as Van Gaal has. I really thought this bs with playing players all over the place would stop with LVG but he's taken it to a whole new level.

3451~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

3452~~~
It's ridiculous watching Wayne Rooney shackled in centre midfield while <b>at the same fecking time</b> Di Maria is stuck up front!

It's actually this issue (or two issues, if you will) that are really annoying me about Van Gaal - much more than the formation, or selling players I like.

It's just sabotage. Rooney should be up front in some capacity running defences ragged with Di Maria running from within our own half with the ball.

Obviously Van Gaal knows way more about football than me, hell, most of the posters on here know more about football than me! But on this issue, he's wrong. Spectacularly wrong.

It's as if he does something controversial once and then is so stubborn and vain that he has to then stick with it until it produces <i>some kind</i> of positive result, so he can then say, "I told you so".

Conversely, if the controversial action goes well to start with he then sticks with it anyway cuz it's gone well!

So, basically, we've got a manager who makes lots of controversial decisions - and then sticks with them indefinitely!

This is how we've ended up playing a ridiculous formation, with our best striker (yeah, he is) in centre fecking midfield, our best creative midfielder (ADM) as a centre forward, our best centre midfielders (Herrera and Fellaini) either on the bench or in the box having long balls flung into them, with Phil Jones taking corners...

It's a mess. It really is.

I like Van Gaal, and I really want it to work out with him. But the guy is just getting more and more erratic with this shit.

It's like being managed by a fecking avant garde jazz musician or something.

3453~~~
He's average there. That's been my biggest beef with LvG here. Rooney is our best striker, playing in CM. Our best CM is playing as striker.

3454~~~
And it's not just him. Half our best players are playing out of position at the moment. Di Maria up front, Mata and Rooney in CM, Carrick spending half his time at CB. I think the basic substance of our football is better than under Moyes but the shape is absolutely killing us, and not just because 352 is so clearly not working.

3455~~~
Yup I got that wrong. Perhaps in a different midfield he could work but when he us asked to be the main man in a weird formation, he is lost and is not playing his game.

3456~~~
Considering it usually means our attack is dead, why would anyone stand it? It's very predictable. Teams have figured it out. If we had a decent player on the right I could understand. Rooney though, obviously still thinks it's 2009 and Valencia is able to cross.

3457~~~
The best days I've seen of Rooney were in 09-10 when he tore Milan, Bayern and many English clubs all a new Arse hole. I don't know where that Wayne Rooney is anymore but he definitely isn't still around imo. This was the same Rooney who would shoot with his laces over the side of his foot. 
The new Rooney (from 2013) onwards is a midfielder imo. I think he gets more pleasure being a playmaker, creating chances and scoring whenever he can. You can see it in every aspect of his persona. He's the leader, he's matured, he has a responsibility and he enforces that through attacking and defending. He's the best in our team in that role, maybe Di Maria can surpass him but not yet. So why move him upfront?

I genuinely loved seeing Wayne upfront but I think he is destined for midfield.

3458~~~
Definitely was at the start of the season. Since turning to that formation directly from hell I'd argue we have looked any better at all.

3459~~~
Also he's currently our best finisher.

3460~~~
God help us

3461~~~
We were actually woeful at the start of the season. Really really poor.

The only run of half-decent football was most of the 7 games with a back four I analysed in the ass-twitching thread. That and some isolated games in the run of twelve 532s that followed (Hull, Newcastle and maybe Palace)

3462~~~
Of course, it does not usually means that, and what's he supposed to do, ignore Valencia completely? I'm sure LVG would love that.

3463~~~
No, he's supposed to vary it up. You know, like what most good players do?

3464~~~
I thought our football improved though. Had some woeful results but I could take that as we looked the part going forward and footballing wise, definitely an improvement to our hoof-football last season. Imo that is. Thought we look much much worse now with somehow being able to grind out results. Don't think Palace was good to watch neither. Hull I'll give you but they were so incredibly woeful it was unbelievable.

3465~~~
The first half against spurs was 532? Seem to recall we were pretty good in that half and should have been well ahead.

3466~~~
Which he does...? You make it seem like all he does is pass, pass and pass to Valencia. In last game for instance, he had 5 passes to him to the right, all successful, out of his 80+ passes in the game.

3467~~~
I generally think he ignores closer and perhaps better alternatives through the middle with that pass. He is still in striker mode with his back to goal, thinking that sweeping the ball wide will result in a cross he can finish off. 

In midfield you need to have more of a picture about you, sometimes Mata is free right next to him, or a striker is ready for a 1-2 but they are all ignored. Our play generally coincides of a few passes around at the back, into Rooney who shifts it wide. We then trundle up to the box which when the rubbish cross is put in, either get's headed straight back out or put out for a corner. It's just not exciting or creative in any way.

3468~~~
It means Valencia ends up seeing the ball more than most of our XI on the pitch, which spells big trouble for us considering his attacking play is almost non existent. A successful pass doesn't mean anything if we lose the threat directly afterwards. Opposing teams know how to deal with it, infact it's rather simple for them. Swansea on the first day was the worst. Their left back intercepted at least 5 of those passes out wide. Where did his other 70 odd passes go? Did he do anything creative with them? Can't really remember seeing any cutting penetrative passes to create a chance. He seems too comfortable in keeping things ticking over, which should be Carrick/Blind's job when they play there.

3469~~~
Can't remember the one for the goal even?

And for other 'issues', think you'll have to be a bit more angry at LVG, than Rooney/Valencia.

3470~~~
The idea that all Rooney does is pass to Valencia is a hilariously wrong. He has more assists from passes through the middle than Mata does and has played some very good through balls already this season. He's well capable of that as is very obvious. With the pace we play with though, sometimes that's the only choice we have. Certainly a better option than lumping it up top to RVP and expecting him to pull off miracles. Kroos is a fantastic CM and all he did in the Copa Del Rey game this week was spray the ball to the wide men. It's a bummer that it's Valencia out wide but there's nothing we can do about that with Rafael crocked as usual.

3471~~~
The pass for the goal, come on. It's like when some were saying his free kick against Southampton was an outrageous cross. I am angry that he plays in midfield, but this is hardly something new considering he's been lumping the ball to the right for years. Yes it's a bummer Valencia is out right, so why the feck does he always look to pass to him? People think he's destined to be a midfielder ffs. Kroos can play that pass with his eyes closed, and the difference for him is he can play it anywhere on the pitch such is his wide array of talent.

3472~~~
They're obviously exaggerating to make a point but it's fecking ridiculous, I agree.

One thing's for sure. He's not been playing well at all in recent weeks. Been arguably our best player this season but has gone completely off the boil over the course of that long run of games in central midfield.

3473~~~
So Rooney can't pass and when he does it's only to Valencia, he's got no pace, he's not worldclass, his first touch is crap, he keeps losing the ball....etc blah blah blah, what utter nonsence!

I'm sorry but I see a completey different player who <b>is</b> worldclass, who can pass long or short, who scores plenty of goals aswell as creates them, who is deadly on set pieces, who is deceptively quick... blah blah blah etc

3474~~~
When did you last see that player?

3475~~~
I lay no blame on Rooney's door for him playing poorly in midfield. He shouldnt be playing there.

3476~~~
Less than a month ago. What team have you been watching?

3477~~~
He hasn't really, but he has played very well. Probably our best attacking player, but De Gea and Blind have been better than him.
EDIT: And Carrick

3478~~~
1 in 6 then, not bad. Almost Nani esque. You're right, he was good in the Newcastle game. Been garbage since though.

3479~~~
Agreed about Rooney's go-to ball out to Valencia - it does get a tad predictable and over-used. He does generally have a decent range of passing, particularly his long-range game, so it's a shame when he constantly opts for the safe ball to Valencia's feet. Given Valencia's curious loss of confidence in taking players on since a few seasons ago, more often than not our attacks end up fizzling out: either when he turns back out and plays it to one of the back 3; or when he piledrives the ball into the opposing left-back's shin-pads. 

I don't think the decision to play Rooney in midfield is inherently a bad one. But it is puzzling when you have a ready-made pass-and-move midfielder in Herrera twiddling his thumbs on the bench while we make do with both Rooney and Mata playing and sometimes struggling in unaccustomed roles. Van Gaal talks about how the players haven;t adapted to the new system but he doesn't half make it hard for them to, by not only changing the formation but playing many of the players in completely different roles than they're used to.

3480~~~
Let Herrera / Di maria / Carrick / Blind / Fellaini be the "2" in midfield, and leave Rooney to battle it out with Mata for the AMC position. He can still defend and help the midfield from that position, but also helps him get into the box a lot more.

3481~~~
Just wanted to say that I agree 100% with this post of yours <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3482~~~
Honestly, sometimes I get the feeling LVG is pulling one huge prank on us all. Phil fecking Jones taking corners, Rooney in CM and ADM upfront <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3483~~~
Nice feedback.

3484~~~
I fecking hope not.

3485~~~
I would say 08/09 was the last season he did that frequently. In 09/10, we saw a new Rooney who was brilliant and added that composure, consistency and clinical sidefooted finishing which was very nice to see. He took his game up a notch and thrived on the responsiblity without Tevez and Ronaldo. It was his best season IMO and I firmly believe we could have won the EPL (the Chelsea 2-1 loss) and made the CL final (the Bayern match <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>) had it not been for Rooney's injury in the business end of the season. He was in a top 3 strikers in the world form at that period. He was excellent in the 11/12 season as well and some might argue, even better.

It's just a shame that after those 2 great seasons, he has a spectacularly crap international tournament and proceeds to have a disappointing season in which he wants to leave the club <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

Anyway, he should be used as a striker, plain and simple. I don't get why LVG isn't impressed by him as a striker. He wasn't too impressive there at the start of the season but so was RVP who got chance after chance. At the very least he can play him as a second striker or an att mid whereby he can still contribute to the midfield with his physicality and industry by dropping deep. Has LVG gone in depth about why he's using him there?

3486~~~
Let him play as a striker and Di Maria will always find him just like he found Ronaldo a million times last season in Madrid.

3487~~~
Club captain, "talisman," "Heartbeat of the team," "He plays every game," is not in the squad. 

Interesting

3488~~~
He's been looking jaded and Van Gaal's given him the week off. Nothing to see here. Move along.

3489~~~
Wasn't suggesting for a second anything controversial.

Just a bit surprised he's not there....

3490~~~
It is a surprise. Good management though. He's looked quite out of sorts. Plus it means we can actually play midfielder's in midfield!

3491~~~
The mere fact you actually had to say that is a disgrace on LVG's part <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3492~~~
Yay! Midfielders in midfield!!!

3493~~~
Sigh, indeed...

3494~~~
That's because I wasn't speculating about the past or the future in it! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Apparently we're useless without him

3498~~~
why cant we fecking play him upfront, its getting criminal now. Use mata or di maria or januzaj as the 10.

3499~~~
Well, there were decidedly less long balls - at least it seemed so to me while watching - which is something that happens a lot with Rooney in midfield and half the time this just gifts the opposition possession, which against PL opposition is ridiculous and has cost us points this season.

In fact, we didn't look <i>unbalanced</i>, just blunt.

I actually think there was a lack of decent movement up front from Falcao and Wilson. It's all well and good repeating the 'feeding on scraps' mantra after pretty much every game (and I know that you lean in this direction, Rossi), but the two of them just had no <i>hustle</i>. And their pressing and harrying from the front is so weak.

But back on topic, I actually think as poor and dull as that game was it was still a step in the right direction to have midfielders in midfield!

3500~~~
Sorry.....I've read what you wrote....It makes sense....

But, last night has yet to hit me....I'm still in the 88th min, thinking, "ah we'll score. Doesn't matter how shit we are"

Await my thread tomorrow when it hits me......Titled, "OH MY GOD WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!!!!!!!"

3501~~~
RvP and Falcao both got a chance each last night that were fairly easy for players of their standard (RvP's probably more so) and you just know that if Rooney got those, playing upfront, he'd probably have scored one.

3502~~~
Miserable first half. Its not fair on the guy anymore. Regardless of others performance's today, you have to find a place for him up top. You can only get away with him in CM for so long. Find the best place for your captain Louis.

3503~~~
Good in the 2nd half. Lovely pass to Di Maria on the volley

3504~~~
Way too sloppy. Should have got 2 assists today tho.

3505~~~
Poor performance, nothing to do with the role. He's had poor performances up front too

3506~~~
I've found it painful to watch him hanging around the center circle in this match. Misplaced passes, poor crosses, some light jogging. His free kick didn't clear the first man and his corners have been low/short. He does not look like a dangerous player.

3507~~~
Awful first half, got better in the second. Can we not play him as a midfielder, please?

3508~~~
What's that now, like 6 or 7 in a row? He was better in the 2nd half but it's clear that we would be better as a team if we played with proper midfielders instead of him in there. I'd much prefer him fighting it out with the other 2 up top.

3509~~~
Doesn't even seem to be playing as an advanced CM at the moment. 

Would like to see him joining in with the attack more, but he's hanging back an awful lot. Which is a bit of a shame, when you consider that he's a threat to the oppositions goal from anywhere within 25 yards of it. Indeed, that his finishing is one of his biggest assets.

RvP and Falcao have been hit and miss this season, but have always been awarded the privilege of playing in their favoured position. Rooney rarely has. But then I guess the captaincy, and a near guaranteed start when he's fit, is a privilege in itself, and that's what LvG has given him.

3510~~~
Not a CM by any means

3511~~~
We've got to stop playing him in midfield. He was terrible there today. He just doesn't have the close control or sure passing of a top centre mid.

3512~~~
I mean, ask RvP or Falcao to play in midfield for 7 games running, and let's see how well they do.

3513~~~
I'm not saying I disagree, but I can also see the merits in LVG's thinking using him there. Today Rooney didnt really do what he's shown he can do from the position earlier this season. As far as I can remember he only broke forward the one time where he won the ball and was then played behind the defence and he tried to chip it over to Falcao and it was the tiniest bit too heavy for him, but Falcao should have done better. Other than that I can't remember Rooney making a good run forward to try and affect the scoreline.

He was just happy to sit there and play over 100 passes, with plenty of them being very dodgy. He wasnt trying very hard to do anything other than that. So its not the role, it was his attitude. Today he played with the attitude of a holding midfielder

3514~~~
x100 this. Wayne is obviously trying his best to play in midfield, but he is just not a midfielder, and it is not his fault. Wayne is a 30+ goals a season striker and should be played to his strengths.

3515~~~
Definitely agree with that. I Think that one reason that we keep him there is to fit everyone in but also because aside from Carrick we don't have anyone in midfield with his range of passing (despite how inconsistant as it is.).

3516~~~
He's playing way too deep. At times he was deeper than Blind.

3517~~~
Predictable that he'd play as a midfielder when the squad was given out by Bates or whoever the feck did it on twitter. Idiotic to say the least with 2 midfielders sitting on the bench.

3518~~~
He's just such a wasteful midfielder; in fact he's a pretty average midfielder, but he's a top class striker. I believe we would have played much better with Herrera on the pitch today. Is Rooney generally better defensively than Herrera either? I have my doubts.

3519~~~
He was very, very poor and I am a big fan of the greedy bastard.

3520~~~
Agreed. Even his telegraphed pinged balls to Valencia seem to have gone to shit.

We do need a bit of physicality and work rate in the middle at times and Rooney provides that. We didn't need it that much in this game, without really much of a battle in the middle, with primarily the threat of counters to deal with. He should really just play up top in his best position in most games like this one.

3521~~~
He's not a midfielder. Its just a complete and utter waste.

3522~~~
We have to play him as a striker, and not a striker who has to come and get the ball, just as a pure striker. He adds close to nothing in midfield.

3523~~~
He has gotten deeper and deeper as the season has gone on. At this point with Di Maria in the free role and RvP/Falcao/Wilson all getting the strikers spots between them, he is basically playing as an orthodox CM, something he hasn't got the patient passing or variety to do effectively, at the very most playing as an AM like De Bruyne for Wolfsburg is the most he should be asked to do. I guess right now LvG just trusts him over Herrera and Fellaini to help Blind.

3524~~~
I'm all for playing Rooney as a striker, but I wouldn't say he adds nothing to midfield. In, my opinion, he made us a lot more solid, with his great work rate and willingness to get back - something we didn't have when we played Leicester away. He also demands the ball off others, keeps the ball ticking and has a great passing range.

Today Rooney made 107 passes, with a passing accuracy of 86%. People sometimes get annoyed with his constant long balls out wide, but in such a narrow formation, against teams that defend compact, they can prove to be very effective, as it often create's one vs one situations. Today Rooney completed 13 of his 19 long balls. 

I wouldn't even mind Rooney playing in centre midfield, just as long as he's the more advanced one - similar to how Lampard was played for Chelsea. 

Next season, if we can see a three of say Blind, an all round box to box player and Rooney, where he can venture forward, knowing he's got enough protection behind him, then I think he'll shine. At the moment, he's playing too deep.

3525~~~
Fair enough, but he loses the ball too often, his touch isnt good enough in those tight spaces and his positional awareness just isnt that good, other than that, we're wasting his qualities by it, based on his last 7 performances, I wouldnt even think he's a world class player. He isnt very creative for a midfielder and he doesnt rase the tempo. Herrera is a far better option for midfield imo.

3526~~~
He'd give us some of what we lack as a striker and allow us to play an actual midfielder in midfield.

Makes too much sense to do it I guess.

3527~~~
It's a shame seeing him in midfield. 1, because Herrara does his job 5 times better and 2, he's much better up front alongside RVP.

3528~~~
I wasn't impressed. I'm still of the opinion that giving him that huge deal was one of the biggest errors of recent years (though not quite a Moyes level blunder). 

Rooney is a good player, no better, no worse than that. He certainly shouldn't be in the team regardless of form. In midfield he seems to have some games in which his late runs into the box are more than the opposition can cope with, while other times I wonder how he got selected.

3529~~~
People keep saying about him scoring goals from midfield, he has scored 8, the last two against Newcastle on Boxing Day, 5 from a midfield position. 8 goals from a Wayne Rooney in any position isn't great. When the forwards aren't scoring then he should be picking up the slack. This could end up his worse goal scoring season ever, can't see him being happy about that.

3530~~~
That diagonal ball to Valencia/van Gaal was something else, I thought even him isn't capable of something that stupid.

3531~~~
He is no midfielder. 

It is funny that many are so critical of him in this role though as it is often used to help him win many a comparison debate. 'RVP is the better striker but Rooney is a better player. I'm sure Persie couldn't play midfield'. I think it is becoming clear that neither can Rooney at the top level.

3532~~~
Just want him playing behind RvP again.

3533~~~
Either play him as a forward, #10 or don't play him at all. Its not his fault really but it's so obvious he's not a Midfielder

3534~~~
This.

3535~~~
This. 1000x this.

3536~~~
A 25-30 goal a season striker being played in midfield is fecking madness.

3537~~~
It's absurd isn't it? I mean I sort of get that Van Gaal wants Falcao/RvP (although he should see by now it's not working very well), but why not Rooney as the AM and Herrera in the team deeper down? Why Rooney in CM? It baffles me.

3538~~~
He's not a 25-30 goal a season striker anymore.

3539~~~
Add the fact that there was over £90 million worth of midfielders sat on the bench today, and it makes you want to cry. 

I don't have a problem with Rooney being played in midfield in times of need (suspensions or injuries) or when he gets older, but right now he should be in his prime, up top, doing what he does best. Playing him in midfield just smacks of trying to find a way to fit in all the 'superstars'.

3540~~~
Not really Rooney's fault but he is an average midfielder.

3541~~~
He absolutely is. Best finisher at the club. The last time he played as an out and out striker he scored 27 league goals in 34 matches. Just saying.

3542~~~
Look at the position he was asked to play today mate. At times he was closer to the CB's than Blind! LVG's tactics and team selections right now are questionable to say the least.
Spot on!

3543~~~
When he plays in midfield there's too many occasions when he receives the ball facing the defence and plays the ball first time either sideways or backwards, often straight back to the player who passed him the ball, which slows our build-up play. On many of these occasions he is actually under little or no pressure and has space to turn with the ball and then start an attack. As a striker he is probably used to having no time on the ball and so it is instinctive for him to make that choice. It's things like that which need to be coached out of him if he is to adapt to that role and it's just one example of how changing his position so often may hinder his instincts.

Scholes, for example, would always receive the ball on the spin ready to play a penetrating pass and would only play sideways or backwards once he had decided the forward pass wasn't on.

3544~~~
That was four seasons ago and he's regressed physically since then. Plus successive managers haven't thought him good enough up front any longer.

Granted some of it is the lack of bodies in midfield so he's not had a hugely consistent run but I don't think he's got it in him to lead the line and be amongst the leagues top scorers anymore.

3545~~~
Whether right or wrong I actually think they feel he's too good to be wasted playing on the shoulder of the last defender.

3546~~~
LvG can't play him as an AM now as he's decided to use Di Maria there as his passing is way too erratic to actually play in the midfield.

3547~~~
Thought he was our worst player although did improve slightly. He just isn't a CM. Like has been said it is a complete waste to play him there. It helps no one either. The team would be a lot better with Herrera or Fellaini in that role. Rooney should be competing with Falcao/RvP for a spot. But LvG doesn't seem to have the guts to drop one of them (at least not for a sustained period).

3548~~~
Said it before and I'll say it again.

We have better midfielders, better #10s and IMO better #9s.

Rooney being made captain and thus starting every game was a mistake, and a major elephant in the room. 

Perhaps not as big an issue at the moment as it will be the next few seasons.

Ferguson wanted rid, and to be honest, if he had managed to get rid and bought wisely we'd of been better off for it.

3549~~~
I thought after the Newcastle match that LVG may have been on to something giving him a box to box role.  I was wrong, he looks like a poor man's Gerrard out there.  

If he isn't good enough to play as a striker he needs to sit on the bench more often, because we would be better off playing actual midfielders in their proper position.

3550~~~
I get the feeling LVG wants his one last special individual project to turn Rooney into a full time midfielder. I also get the feeling LVG is an idiot.

3551~~~
Play him up top and he will be.

3552~~~
He's a 30 goal a season striker whenever he's playing as a striker. Play him in central midfield, and well, he won't score more then 15.

3553~~~
What proof do you have of that?

I'm basing my hunch on the fact he's slower, less agile and generally less mobile than he was before. That's due to age, that's the same reason why RVP and Falcao (well, plus the injury) aren't what they were. You can't fight it and I think Rooney will be more susceptible to age deteriorating his physical traits than most others.

I don't have proof either but at least it's solid reasoning. He's not what he once was and LVG knows that, hence he plays in midfield.

3554~~~
I don't think RVP or Falcao are better than him right now. RVP has lost a step and Falcao is in some sort of Torres-ian existential post-injury physical and mental funk. I think Rooney is the best 9 we have these days.

3555~~~
If he is declining physically like you suggest then wouldn't that make playing him in midfield even more silly? He needs mobility and agility to cover the pitch in that box-to-box kind of role.

3556~~~
Anyone think LVG might offload him in the summer?

Just a thought....It's not like with Fergie where we were used to things and saw it coming. We don't know with LVG

Obviously it's just me speculating....Anyone think the same?

3557~~~
I doubt he'd offload the captain.

3558~~~
Dunno now....Many of us thought Fergie would never offload Becks....Not to mention Keane, who we all thought was close to Fergie.

As I said it's just me speculating. The fact we're trying to shoehorn him into midfield and it's not working kinda made me think this.

3559~~~
It would indeed. But there he is, looking like a fish out of water in midfield so obviously this doesn't matter.

3560~~~
I'm one of those who thought Rooney would fall out with van Gaal when LVG wouldn't play him as a striker, so my judgment is a bit biased against our captain.  Offloading Rooney would solve a lot of problems for van Gaal.  We have too many under performing big names that can't be fit into a "balanced" 11 and he doesn't seem to rate Rooney as a striker.  I think Fergie saw him becoming a long-term problem due to physical decline and Moyes didn't take the opportunity that Fergie set up for him to get rid of Rooney without being blamed for his exit.

3561~~~
This. Ferguson's retirement came at the right time for Rooney's United career. Wasn't Ferguson a known admirer of Lewandowski?

3562~~~
Completely agreed. I mentioned the same in the unpopular opinions thread.

3563~~~
I agree. And the bought wisely part is very important. 

Rooney really isn't our best option for any position he plays. He's not a midfielder and playing him as one of the two strikers rarely works. But last summer I wouldn't have want him to leave as we had enough change already. But Rooney isn't captain material and he hasn't particularly earned his automatic starting position.

3564~~~
So we are now on our third successive manager who won't drop Rooney when clearly out of form, does he have pictures of the chairman blowing sheep or something?

3565~~~
He is not a midfielder. We need to get him in spaces where he can score goals.

3566~~~
Couple of so-so games in an unfavoured position, and he's back to being over the hill and should be sold.

Don't ever change, Red Cafe.

(And next week it'll be someone else)

3567~~~
Completely agree.

3568~~~
This. 100% agree.

3569~~~
Better #9s? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Jesus. Just days ago they were both over the hill and fecking useless. Both scored at home against the lowest team in the league and they're back... I don't see what Mata does better than Rooney at the #10 than having a better first touch, either. He's very passive in possession for the most part.

3570~~~
Rooney is our most important player and has been for a number of years. There really is no other player like him, what other player is so clinical infront of goal, yet has the passing range that he does and is so willing to be adaptable for the team? His first time finishes are amongst the best in the world, so incredibly underrated what an asset it is. Mata had a class game again Southampton (I think) but his inability to hit a ball first time, like most attacking midfielders, saw him miss several golden opportunities and essentially drop points.

Rooney vs Liverpool is calm, sorts his feet out quickly, gives the keeper the eyes and makes what was by no means an easy chance look so simple. I don't think people would realise what a negative effect it would have on our side if we didn't have him.

3571~~~
RVP is a better #9 certainly. His better hold up play and touch with his back to goal sets him apart from our other strikers even if Rooney is probably the better finisher. Falcao has been gash more often than not but apparently it's all bad luck so I dunno,

Mata is definitely not a better #10. People confuse elegance with effectiveness. I've never seen Rooney afforded the same excuses Mata has been when he's not creating and Rooney's created far more clear cut chances from a deeper position.

3572~~~
Pub Rooney showed up yesterday. So disappointed, and he should have been subbed off for Herrera. Herrera's a better midfielder, no doubt about that.

3573~~~
I'll possibly give you RvP, but he has looked really laborious at times this season, and we seem to have a trend to games like this or the game against Southampton, to the three or four really poor ones inbetween. 

I really do agree about Mata, many will bite our heads of because he's a nice chap and very loved, but in honesty the best things about his play are positioning himself in goalscoring opportunities and having a fantastic first touch. Rooney scores and assists as many as he (normally more) whilst having the added physicality from that role, so what is the point of Mata?

3574~~~
Falcao has been good id say, his movement is amongst the best I've seen. To me, it seems like he's just simply not comfortable with finishing when he's under pressure, he has less time than he would if he was in Portugal or Spain; reminds me of Forlan in that regard. He's better than him though, so I expect to see improvements as he becomes more accustomed to the premier league.

3575~~~
After <i>surviving</i> the Summer of 2013, when 95% of Caftards wanted him out, this is all harmless.

3576~~~
It's funny how starting Rooney  is a big problem but everytime he don't start we miss him badly. More than every other player.

3577~~~
Big call to say Falcao is better than Forlán. I don't think I'd agree, both were amazing at their best but I'd say Forlán is better because he was more rounded.

3578~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G3zyG8cWKTc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
Still hurts?

3579~~~
Upon reflection it probably was, it's a lot closer than I made out. I suppose it's easier to make a case for Falcao because Forlan first made a name for himself where he struggled in the Premier League, whereas Falcao still has time to make his time here a success.

3580~~~
Are you talking of their peaks?

3581~~~
Yeah. Don't think there's much wrong with rating either higher than the other though, both have their plus points.

3582~~~
Falcao at his best is comfortably the better striker. It is easy to see with Falcao that if the Falcao of old was in this league, he'd be tearing it apart. I mean even this shadow of his former self, looks a decent goal threat in every game he plays in, it is just he isn't sharp enough to warrant that price tag. It is a shame, there are moments where you see glimpses of his old self and you think what a player, but the guy isn't what he used to be.

Forlan was a good player but Falcao was at one stage the number one striker in the world.

3583~~~
I don't really agree but fair enough. I don't disagree with what you said about Falcao, just that I think Forlán at his best was a lot better than 'good'. He wasn't the world's best but he wasn't far off. Could ping one in from 35 yards with either foot, formed an amazing partnership with Agüero (after ripping up Spain with Villarreal), great technically.

But anyway...Rooney!

3584~~~
Forlan is more talented, more complete.. I agree about that. But Falcao in his prime, he really was a monster.. he was considered by most people to be the best in his position. The one striker who was competing with the Messi/Ronaldo phenomenon. Forlan never attained that status for me but obviousl deserves huge credit for his performances in the world cup 2010. 

I just think prime Falcao - if he had played for United, he'd definitely have ended up a legend here, no question.. he had that mentality and class to play for the big boys. Forlan never had that in my opinion, he enjoyed being a big fish in a small pond and I always questioned if he could make that step up.

3585~~~
How was Falcao comfortably better at their peaks? Falcao's scoring records are boosted by the Europa League but in the league alone Forlan scored 30+ goals something Falcao has never matched. That's without even going into how Forlan's all round game is better than Falcao's.

3586~~~
Louis van Gaal recognises he offers far more than a 9 and if played up top he might lack the discipline because it's in his nature to help out defensively, he doesn't have the playmaking qualities of a 10 in a 4-2-3-1, I'd prefer Mata or Herrera in that role, I'm not convinced Rooney will perform to his potential when Falcao and RVP are ahead of him.

He could perhaps perform the support striker role in a flat 4-4-2 but we don't play that, in the diamond his tendency to drop will mean he gets in the way of the 10 and also in a flat 4-4-2 he would likely need a more pacey striker which we don't have and even then he might find himself clearing balls outside our area and then by the time he sprints back up the counter is dead.

Louis van Gaal recognises his talent and probably thinks he could bring the best out of him as a box to box midfielder but adjusting to a new position will take time, he has goals in him and the more chances we start to create the more goals he'll start getting from midfield. At this point we now would have goals from a central midfielder in addition to goals from the 10, two 9s and potentially the other central midfielder too.

Retraining to a new position will take time, he has the qualities to be effective however he needs to reduce the errors and I also think he needs to improve his short passing and the weight he puts on passes. His passing range is good, his long passes are good and even his short passes however we are talking about operating in dangerous areas, if you lose the ball then you possibly give the opponent a goal scoring opportunity.

Louis van Gaal probably sees the potential, when you look at Rooney he is complete, it actually makes sense to play him there when you look at his qualities but of course he is not going to instantly retrain to that position but when he does he could be one of the best at it and we all know how hard it is to come by a complete central midfielder these days. Furthermore due to his long shots and finishing he could contribute many goals and arriving late into the box will make him hard to mark, he can pop up in the space to take his shot.

It's probably a long term plan.

3587~~~
He'll be 30 in October. I cannot see that aspect of his game improving and I'd rather have a top class specialist for that for that role for the long term.

3588~~~
Of course you can improve it. You get put in a different position and you don't have the same awareness of what's around you. With experience, you become familiar with the surroundings, what balls to play in certain situations and how best to weight them. Doesn't matter if you're 29 or 19.

3589~~~
Probably at 19 but not at nearly 30 at the top level.

3590~~~
The only difference is that at 30 is that you're more developed technically already, so in theory it should be easier to improve. The problem isn't that it's out of Rooneys technical capability to play short passes and weight balls, it's his understanding.

3591~~~
Forlan did that once. 32 in 33. Falcao's best league season is either 25 in 28 at Porto or 28 in 34 at Atletico. I don't really think it's such a huge reference point.

I'm not disagreeing with the point that Forlan had a bit more about him though, but when you consider that Falcao is about 40 goals shy of Forlan's record overall in just shy of half as many games played, you've got to give him some credit.

3592~~~
I don't think he's lost his agility or pace as much as he has lost his role. Playing in a position that is not natural to you and being forced to do so (I mean he doesn't run all over the pitch anymore the way he used to) would make a lot of players look like they're a bit lethargic and lost ability. I'm also reffering to 09/10 as proof of his ability. 

Besides, it would be one thing if RVP and Falcao were firing goals left and right. It just frustrates me that we aren't using Rooney as a striker anymore. 

SAF bought all those strikers because well he always liked to have around four strikers. About his first touch, whenever I see him playing up front his first touches seem to come off really well rather than in midfield which could be because he's a natural goal scorer and finds it easier to set himself up to score. I wasn't saying he should play only because he's a natural goal scorer. 

Calling him a "jack of all trades" really is an insult to Rooney and I get the feeling that it's because of his versatility that you and many others have that opinion.

3593~~~
Who would you rather make Captain? It's really disappointing to see United fans not rate Rooney as a very important player. I'm pretty sure if Rooney went somewhere else last season we'd be in the second half of the table.

3594~~~
He's becoming a problem and it's mothis own doing either. Game after game he looks a complete misfit in central midfield because well, you know, he isn't a midfielder. LVG has basically got himself into a corner now with rooney being told he isn't good enough as a striker and everyone told that the captain must play. Time for him to bite the bullet and go back on this stance of his.

Personally I'd play him as one of the two strikers. Or in the number 10 role behind the two in the diamond but not in midfield.

3595~~~
He really needs to play upfront. He's been horrible in midfield and our coaching staff should have seen that by now. Either play him upfront or not at all

3596~~~
This!

If he's not good enough for the striker spot then better sit him on the bench than trying to find him place in the team just because he's captain.

Personally think he's better than both Falcao and RVP, just LVG doesn't like him up-front for some reason, but he doesn't like Herrera as well so it could be there's no real logical explanation with Rooneys omission from striker positon just like Herrerars from midfield.

3597~~~
Long term just means it's the role he'll be playing for seasons to come, so even if his performances have not been quality Louis van Gaal will persist because he wants to give him a solid chance of showing he can do whatever he wants him to do. This is an assumption on my part, it could just be a short term thing.

His short passing probably is fine, I mean't improve his decision making when passing which should come as he gets used to the role and gets more games there. A slightly heavy pass or under hit would be considered an error, I would imagine the errors will reduce as he also gets used to the role.

I do agree with you we should just look at signing a younger player for the role and move Rooney up front especially since RVP will get old and Rooney will get goals. That said if Louis van Gaal genuinely thinks Rooney could start performing fantastically well as a central midfielder then he has got to stick to his judgement, we'll see what happens, I wouldn't expect much consistency until he gets more time in that position.

Louis van Gaal is playing a dangerous game though, part of his philosophy is always planning for the future, that is to say building a team that will be champions both domestically and in europe but also leaving behind a very good basis for the next manager to build on. It's a dangerous game because if he doesn't get top four he will get sacked, but it's a game he likes to play.

3598~~~
The main elephant in the room is, why not playing Rooney as one of the two strikers; just to accommodate 'lesser' strikers there.

3599~~~
The amount of passes he overhits and misplaces are just come off awkwardly isn't good enough for a central midifelder I'm afraid. At best we can afford one midfielder who is risky with his passing and that has to be di Maria everytime because he can do things with the ball at feet the others simply can't. Rooney has to be further forward focusing on assisting and scoring,and not on running the game.

3600~~~
Despite being a big Wayne Rooney fan, i wouldn't want to see him in our midfield in his 30s, i think he still has 2 seasons to offer us at least 12 goals each but other than that i think giving him the captains armband was the perfect way to usher him out of the team and perhaps help him secure a big move to end his career, with that being said i still think despite his so far average performances in the midfield he deserves to play behind the strikers due to that extra something he offers the team.

3601~~~
IMO you don't need to be Pirlo or Fabregas to pull off short passes. It's basic football. Very basic, and it's shocking how he fecks it up so often. 

He's lethal in the box and that's where he should be played. In a way it's a shame we signed Falcao because this season could've been used to forge an understanding between him and Persie built around a new philosophy. Our third striker should be a squad player like Hernandez rather than have 3 we feel that we absolutely have to jam into the squad.

3602~~~
The problem is not his passing or technique. He doesn't really have the awareness to play in a midfield 2. The further forward you play, the more instinctive your passing is and you can see it in the way he passes the ball. You need to be a bit more calculated when you play as deep as he's been playing recently. 

Now it's entirely possible that given enough time he might get used to the role (I doubt it though) but I don't see any benefit of turning a 30 year old Rooney into a CM when we already have better midfielders sitting on the bench.People bring up Schweinstiger but he was an average winger. Rooney is a brilliant striker. Play him as a #10 or #9 and he'll get you an excellent haul of goals and assists.

Playing him at CM benefits no one.

3603~~~
That daft volleyed pass he attempted to play back to Valencia in the first half (Schlupp should have hit the target) is exactly the sort of thing we will see with relative frequency the more we continue with Rooney in midfield. It does his confidence no good whatsoever and it will cost us when the opposition player is better than Schlupp.

3604~~~
On one hand it's clear that he just shouldnt play in midfield but then again you really wonder how poor he can play there and messes up the simplest of tasks like short passing, control of the ball etc.

3605~~~
He is a quality striker and an average midfielder get him up top with Falcao!

3606~~~
Extremely pedantic but was Rooney the only United player not to pay their respects to Munich on Twitter? Even the new lads did.

3607~~~
He did on Instagram.

3608~~~
1) imo, judging someone over that is in poor taste. Paying respects is a personal expression, not something you put on a checklist
2) He did, on his Facebook page. Don't think he uses twitter all that much anymore

3609~~~
It doesn't matter.

3610~~~
I know its a personal choice to pay your respects,  I was just wondering, and now I now know after posting on here that he did.

3611~~~
Hasn't had a shot on target this year.

3612~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Really? 6 games, right?

3613~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

3614~~~
Not a midfielder

3615~~~
About at pointless in midfield as you can get. Such a waste. 

Van Gaal best sort this shit out. Either don't play him or put him up front if he gets privilege being his captain.

3616~~~
Just play him as a false 9 ffs, its such a waste playing him so deep in the midfield. I'm losing patience with LVG.

3617~~~
What position is he actually playing in?

He's not even getting into the box in the last few games. Too defensive.

3618~~~
He's probably been our best midfield in this game mind you - but thats more due to the other 3 being absolutely useless. Still, he shouldn't be playing there considering the options we have on the bench.

Blind in particular has been really poor considering his recent form.

3619~~~
It's simply not working for him in midfield. It's getting worse if anything.

3620~~~
Offers nothing offensively, just a Valencia in midfield. Needs to be benched if there's no place for him up front.

3621~~~
Almost like a deep lying playmaker.

3622~~~
He's actually been our best attacking player btw despite being shit.

3623~~~
He's being completely ruined by his manager. I don't see how this is helping the team nor him to play him. Never mind being a CM, now it's even worse, it's a diamond and he plays in the RCM role which is also another role for him to learn.

3624~~~
He's not a fecking midfielder.

3625~~~
Be nice if for just one half we could play him in his natural position and have an actual midfielder where he is now, is that so much to ask?

3626~~~
He really is our Gerrard... more a problem than a solution.

3627~~~
There are two strikers who should be benched before Rooney.

3628~~~
Does anyone actually see anything that LVG must be that makes him play him there? I genuinely have no idea in the point of him being there.

3629~~~
Because of where he is playing, not his actual abilities.

3630~~~
I was wondering that too. Logically it should be the right hand side of our diamond, but he's been all over the place.

3631~~~
I wish he would get a chance to play behind RVP. Falcao and RVP should not be playing together unless we are at Old Trafford.

We could easily have Rooney drop deeper at the point of a midfield 3 and have Blind and Herrera sitting behind with Januzaj and ADM on either flanks.

3632~~~
Right centre midfield, half a CM, half a winger I don't know <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Basically it's another position.

3633~~~
This Falcao loan deal is probably the worst thing we did this summer. We are probably obliged to play him because of contract details, he isnt good anyway and what with RVP being undroppable our best player is being wasted.

3634~~~
Lately,yes.

3635~~~
This exactly.

We say play him up front but the problem is he doesn't stay put when he's there. He's got no discipline ad I doubt he can change at this late stage in his career. So what do we do with him?

3636~~~
He's not a midfielder and he shouldn't be playing there but he's running out of excuses for how uninvolved he is in games.

3637~~~
I would sell him. I actually respect his recent effort and what have you but in terms of ability, he is not good enough for either club or country. He needs to be sold. This club will not progress in terms of playing style until we see the back of him, RVP, Mata etc.

3638~~~
What is it about him that great managers like Fergie and LVG don't trust him up front, when 90% of us on this forum want to see Rooney up there (preferably on his own IMO)? Either play him as a forward or sell him, simple as.

3639~~~
Yeah I don't doubt his recent efforts but I think someone needs to decide to sell him. Also the psychology of making him think he will start regardless is wrong. Rooney rises to the occasion when he feels threatened.

3640~~~
So answer to the slump is selling our top 3 scorers? Right.

3641~~~
Feck me, everytime there is an obvious outlet for a forward pass, he passes it back to defence. He is actually a negative midfielder.

3642~~~
Basically being turned into Scott Parker.

3643~~~
He's not a midfielder!! Ffs, we have actual midfielders on the bench. Completely wasting Rooney in this role.

3644~~~
This is why LVG likes him

3645~~~
He's been pathetic today. No wage next week.

3646~~~
Absolutely fecking awful. Get a proper midfielder on and sort this shit out.

3647~~~
He's got to be dropped, he's supposed to be the creative midfielder and he creates absolutely nothing.

3648~~~
Now he's playing him on the right. He's ruining him!!!

3649~~~
LVG won't drop his captain, I don't think he rates him as a striker so I guess we will be seeing a lot of him as a midfielder.

3650~~~
Along with the other three in midfield he was very poor in possession.

It's not that I want him dropped, it's that I'd rather see an actual midfielder in that position.

3651~~~
He's had a few underpar performances of late, and i've said as much. I didn't think this was one of them. Looked like one of our only players determined to get forward. Meanwhile, the 'better no.9s' continued to miss good chances, despite being given the privilege of playing in their best positions.

3652~~~
Average midfielder, don't play him there. We lack pace and power up front, makes sense to have him there, where he is also much better.

3653~~~
anybody mention he's not a midfielder yet?

3654~~~
Drop him full stop. He's well out of form and needs a massive kick up the arse.

3655~~~
what. 

Impacted the game at the zero to negative level today.

3656~~~
He has no idea what to do in midfield

3657~~~
When have we played well when he's played in midfield this season? It's getting beyond ridiculous now, to take a very very good striker and play him out of position for what reason? Our strikers aren't playing great and we have much better midfielders on the bench. He wasn't the worst playing on the pitch today but he has been in the previous games and one of the main reasons our play has been so poor. If Van Gaal wants to play all three of our star strikers at the same time then move him back to the top of the diamond like before where he was playing well and scoring. At least that way we can have actual midfielders behind our foward line.

3658~~~
Easiest millions I have seen anyone earning.

3659~~~
More key passes than any other of our players, and the most of any player on the pitch. Joint most successful dribbles along with Di Maria. Never lost the ball once through an unsure touch (as compared to 5 times for Di Maria, and 3 times for Falco).

Wasn't excellent by any stretch, but it was an improvement over recent weeks - and it's hardly his fault if the people playing in the position he should be/would like to be keep missing chances.

3660~~~
I actually thought he was our best player on the field, bar De Gea. He was still shit, but the best of the worst.

3661~~~
Sell him.

3662~~~
Key passes? Tear your eyes away from stats and actually look at how we performed. Di Maria was shiteous for all his "successful dribbles" stat. If this is your idea of an improvement over recent weeks, I have no words. Also, gave the ball away a few times in dangerous areas (yet again)

3663~~~
His key passes are shite over hit passes that force our players out wide.

3664~~~
When RvP got his form back and Falcao looked like he might be regaining some form i thought playing Rooney in midfield was perfect. Now given the other twos form it has to be the stupidest decision LvG keeps making (yes ahead of 352)

3665~~~
His style of play is so predictable and shite.

3666~~~
Am I the only one that thought he was one of our better players?

Okay we didn't have many stand out performers but Wayne showed drive and took the ball under pressure when other players in the middle went hiding.

3667~~~
I watched the game, and the stats just quantify what I saw. He looked like our most threatening player for long spells of the match, although that's not saying much given the overall team performance.

3668~~~
People saying he's not a midfielder, and I agree, but he was far from our worst player today. Januzaj was pretty anonymous, Di Maria was awful and Blind got run ragged, due to very little protection. 

It's easy to just come into this thread and say Rooney's not a midfielder, but I can guarantee you our problems lie much deeper than Rooney playing there, at this moment in time.

3669~~~
Sorry for being a dick, but yea he had a couple of driving runs, which ended up in feck all. Most of the time he was pretty anonymous.

3670~~~
Alan Smith mach 2?

3671~~~
STOP PLAYING HIM IN feckING MIDFIELD.

3672~~~
Well it Is a problem since he sees more of the ball than any other player and continues to pick easy passes out wide and ignore strikers runs. He's predictable and slow on the ball and other teams find him easy to play against. Don't know if he would even be that good up front right now. Been crap since newcastle.

3673~~~
I'm not going to blame him for the performances when he's way out of position, this isn't even an AM or CM role, it's RM, Becks old role.

3674~~~
Makes for a totally useless midfielder. Really hate seeing him there.

3675~~~
Was absolutely fuming on the pitch. Can't blame him. You can tell he really wanted to win the match but the formation/tactics and personnel mix was completely wrong.

Just can tell how frustrated he is becoming by playing in a midfield position whilst LVG doesn't have the balls to drop RVP or Falcao. It should be Wayne upfront on his own or with ONE of the other strikers as his partner. Plop ADM on the wing and put Herrera in midfield then watch us score goals for fun.

3676~~~
Less touches than De Gea

3677~~~
It's a bit maddening at this point. 

He's not a midfielder. Herrera? Fellaini? They're midfielders. Feck... Juan Mata... JUAN SODDING MATA is more of a midfielder then him.

What makes it worse is that are two starting strikers are crap as it is. Rooney would be an instant improvement up there.

3678~~~
Shouldn't spout bollocks about being happy to play anywhere If that's the case. Why should he be guaranteed to start?

3679~~~
I had to rewind it when Carragher said that, shocking.

3680~~~
Out of our attack minded players, who was much better?

3681~~~
Yes, it was another position he was asked to play. It's one thing to sacrifice yourself for the good of the team and another to make a change for changes' sake.

3682~~~
He's not playing in midfield. The few games where he played well there he had a properly defined role. He was a proper box to box CM.

Now he's playing in some sort of hybrid DM/AM/Wing position.

3683~~~
Couldn't believe it myself

3684~~~
Arguably, Persie.

3685~~~
More than De Gea, according to WhoScored, and the 3rd most of any of our players after Di Maria and Valencia.

3686~~~
The problem with Rooney in midfield is that Rooney scores quite a lot of important goals over a whole season, match winning goals at times as well. We are obviously missing that with him in midfield which makes this whole situation even worse.

3687~~~
His main job is to finish chances - he had a couple of good ones, and didn't.

3688~~~
What runs?

3689~~~
No excuses, his finishing was piss poor. But his overall play was better. Made the runs expected of him, and held up play well, played in Falcao for a simple finish.

3690~~~
I see so many blaming him, plenty of us have said for ages he doesn't have the passing game to play in midfield so there should be no surprise he's struggling out at RM, he's so far out of position he looks lost.

3691~~~
In our last 6 seasons hes probably been involved(assits + goals) in average 20 goals per season

Now hes not providing that, plus hes anonymous in midfield and is taking up a proper midfielders place, and imbalancing the team, and our play

Not his fault of course, LVG thinks hes found the next schweinsteiger

3692~~~
And Van Persie, as has been said, was <i>playing in his favoured position</i>. Rooney wasn't, and hasn't been for a good a whole. This is surely some important context to be taken into account when assessing their respective performances. Even then, RvP hasn't been looking much better, if he's even been looking better at all.

3693~~~
He loses the ball in dangerous positions nearly every game. He really isn't good enough for that position.

3694~~~
He must be sad right now, wiping his tears with 300k he's getting this week. Next week he'll be a different improved player.

3695~~~
His passing is average but can be good at times, which was a bonus when he was playing much more advanced as an attacker. In midfield, consistency is everything and he is the least consistent passer of the team.

3696~~~
I'm not blaming him for being played out of position. I'm simply pointing out, IMO, that he was very poor today. Some mistakes like giving the ball away in our own half the way he did are inexcusable from anyone regardless of where you're being played. His lack of awareness and intelligence in midfielder that hampers us is on Louis since he insists of keeping the actual midfielders on the bench.

3697~~~
He was comfortably our best combined assistor/scorer per 90 this season as well, until LvG decided to start playing him as an orthodox midfielder. You can hardly blame him for not racking up his usual numbers when he seems to spend as much time defending his own box as he does attacking the oppositions.

3698~~~
For a player who earns as much as he does and is so highly rated by many he should be performing much better, whether he plays in midfield or not.

3699~~~
I probably worded it wrong, but yh what I meant was hes not providing that anymore due to LVG playing him in midfield

3700~~~
Exactly, playing CM is about the percentage pass most of the time, moving the pieces around and creating the angles and picking the right time to make the cutting forward pass, it's a role for patience and accuracy, Rooney has a nice inside-out long pass and a chip pass that work for a SS or an AM, put not as a proper CM.

3701~~~
Needs to lead the line on his own, with Di Maria and Adnan supporting him as inside forwards.

3702~~~
I just feel our poor attacking zombie football over the recent years has coincided with him being made the focal point of our team. When he's played as a striker over the last seasons he has mostly been a poacher, his first touch is mostly awful, he doesn't seem to be too clever in tight situations. He seems like he's programmed, only does what he knows best, mostly passing it to the right flank.

In midfield he stifles our already poor play, everytime there is an obvious short pass, either sideways or forward he seems to look for the easy back pass. He isn't the pacy physical beast he once was, he has become overrated and now he seems yet again undroppable.

Granted we look almost equally inept without him, but thats down to our attacking play being set up at a slow pace with every one of our strikers awfully slow. For me we just need a total revamp of our front two, we should go for pace and power that just seems beyond the reach of RVP, Rooney and Falcao. Pace is  so important in the modern game.

3703~~~
Time for him rvp and falcao to go, no more big undroppable names, we need players with some hunger and desire to prove themselves

3704~~~
He is a striker and that's exactly where he should be playing.

3705~~~
This midfield experiment needs to stop, for the sake of balance and options to our defence. 

Rooney provides very little in midfield but for a burst of energy going backwards after he balls things up. He's not mobile enough to support Valencia with roaming options to pass to progressively, and Lord knows Antonio needs options. 

Sadly, nor is Rooney an astute enough passer of the ball to justify the times he gets it. It's either a Hollywood ball sideways or lay it off and either run at goal with his strikers instinct or watch everyone else try something.

Drop one of Falcao or RVP and stick him up front. Bring Herrera in and try progressive midfield play and balance for the next few games, or Fellaini for physicality. The only worry with Fellaini is that his link up with Valencia is woeful at times.

3706~~~
Being criminally wasted particularly when you see the two has-beens we have playing where he should be.

3707~~~
For the first time ever I would actually agree with him if he were to have another one of his stroppy episodes.

He's being wasted. It's difficult to criticise him when he's playing in a position he can never excel.

3708~~~
Maybe we need to put it on a banner and fly it over the stadium?

3709~~~
back to his absolutely worst performances. Looks like pub player in his 40's at times. Should be benched anyway and if he needs to play bench Falcao and Persie and play Rooney and Wilson up front. Rooney was good as striker with any of his partners so I guess he could work well with Wilson or at least better than this shite..

3710~~~
Adnan can support him from the sidelines. Rooney up top with Mata and Herrera behind and Di Maria on the wings.

3711~~~
Its not his fault.

3712~~~
Was reading an article in the Observer this morning where Van Gaal was talking about converting Reiziger, Rijkaard and Davids to different positions. I really think we just have to get used to Rooney the midfielder now.

3713~~~
Thank you Pexbo. Drop him and watch him come off the bench all firing. He's too bloody comfortable at the moment knowing he's not fighting for his place.

3714~~~
Rooney has positively killed West Ham as a striker in recent years, yet he's so far behind play up front today that he's frozen out of the game.  He also needs to quit with those blind lobs towards our defenders when he has no outlet.

3715~~~
Tbf Rooney does more often than not ignore the strikers runs (however few they may be), I've seen it. He passes it back or out to the wings and the attack breaks down.

3716~~~
Best long side passer in the world.

3717~~~
Another shocking performance in midfield today, not surprised really. He isn't a midfielder and should not be playing there, the experiment by LVG has failed. 

The worst thing for me is that Rooney, alongside RVP NEVER get subbed no matter how bad they play, Rooney should of been replaced by Herrera today and RVP should of came off for Wilson.

3718~~~
In his defence, he'd already brought Fellaini on and we only played for 94 minutes. That's not enough time to make 3 subs.

3719~~~
No its not difficult, he is playing shit regardless what his position is. 

There was a time today we were countering and he had the ball, he had an easy pass into Di Marias path but he somehow managed to over hit it. I couldnt believe it..

3720~~~
Wait till he plays up front again and everyone gets to see how sloppy his touch is. To be honest, he isn't as creative as Van Persie, isn't as good technically at all. I think Van Persie is a better finisher also. Rooney needs to play up top with another striker, no point playing him there by himself. Personally, I want to see him up top instead of Falcao and fit Herrera in. Rooney is average in midfield, but he isn't the full shilling up front either. He's in his usual run of 7/8 rubbish performances at the moment too.

3721~~~
Why are we wasting Rooney in midfield?

3722~~~
Doesn't even look fit enough to play CM. The constant moving, screening of the defence and movement off the ball is different so what he's used to. All his work is so inefficient. He's a couple of seconds behind the danger which leaves Blind doing practically everything. So they both end up doing nothing. 

Van Gaal is making a right mess of this situation.

3723~~~
He looked quick at times, which bodes well for his inevitable return to striker. Wonder if we'd have won with him upfront and Herrera in his spot today.

3724~~~
I'm a massive Rooney fan. I think his contribution is over-looked on these forums and by fans in general but right now I am beyond frustrated. He's being turned into shit and he's playing like utter crap as well. A blind man can see Rooney is not a bloody midfielder. 

RVP and Falcao are missing sitters upfront and we have a proven Manchester United striker giving away possession in midfield.

3725~~~
To shoehorn RvP and Falcao in the side. Apparently van Gaal doesnt care about reputations though <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Biggest myth about him it seems.

3726~~~
The product of being technically underwhelming and an average midfielder. That's what he is and has been for years now. Rooney is a striker and until he plays there I don't expect anything other than what we see in midfield right now. He can't be something he's not.

3727~~~
He needs to be not played in midfield any more! For his sake and ours - we're ruining him in midfield! Please lvg, get your head out of your arse and sort this mess out!

3728~~~

3729~~~
He's a great finisher that will guarantee you goals if you play him up front. In any other position we have better options than him and  so he shouldn't be played anywhere else than up top. It's so obvious to everyone bar Van Gaal. It's infuriating.

He really was dreadful today I thought, he hasn't played well since Christmas but he's not playing in the right position so it's to be expected.

3730~~~
How many shots has he even had in 2015? This midfield role is severely limiting him.

3731~~~
Completely frustrating use of him.

3732~~~
In his United career it seems that the better Rooney's finishing, movement and awareness in the box has become, the further away from goal we've moved him.

3733~~~
If he continues to play in midfield, i doubt he will surpass Sir Bobby's record. Go on Aloysius, thats probably his main aim.

3734~~~

3735~~~
He was absolutely terrible today - he just cannot play this role.

I wouldn't mind seeing him the furthest forward of a three in midfield with Blind and Herrera, with Januzaj and Di Maria on either wing, in a sort of 4-3-3 / 4-2-3-1 hybrid with van Persie up top. I think that would have potential.

Heck - I'd even prefer to see him on the wing like Fergie used to do rather than this role he's being asked to play at the moment.

3736~~~
Now he's Jamie Oliver. You've got to feel for the guy. I'm sure he had such high hopes in August.

3737~~~
I'd like to see RvP dropped for a few games, Rooney up top with Falcao, and Herrera back in the team. Using Rooney in midfield long term is fecking stupid, he's better there than most strikers would be, but it's still totally counter productive.

3738~~~
Hopefully the fans and the media will demand Van Gaal to push Rooney further forward, as they did when it come to getting rid of the 352. He's at best as a number 10 or a second striker. Please use him there.

3739~~~
I don't care if he plays or not...I've lost confidence in all of the so called 'big name' players.

I just want to see midfielders in midfield. His passing is so illogical at times. 

Stick him in there to do a job here or there, that's fair enough. But when you have two forwards who can't score goals, a forward in midfield and two midfielders on the bench, something has to give.

3740~~~
Rooney is not a central midfielder and never will be one, he may look good the odd game, but to get the best out of him and the team he has to be played further forward, at the moment would probably be the best striker in the team if he was played as a striker as the other 2 just waste chance after chance, id like to see him up there again he would be more energetic than both of them playing him as a striker would help bring balance to the diamond formation and incorporate Mata into the side.

3741~~~
How is that not a pen!?

3742~~~
Its not really that much to ask for is it? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3743~~~
If that's the case, then he shouldn't be playing, because in such a role he's totally one-dimensional. He lacks the touch, vision and passing ability needed to play what is probably the most influential position in the attack. Instead, his pathological firing of the ball out to Valencia regardless of whether there's better options has become an unfortunate trademark of his.

Rooney starts as a number 9 or he shouldn't start. The less he can influence the build up, the better, honestly.

3744~~~
He's getting slated on here, I feel for him. It's an unnatural position for him and he's doing his best. 

Ideally, if Mata isn't playing, Rooney should be at the tip of the diamond. Makes perfect sense and you can have Herrera/Fellaini as the RCM.

3745~~~
I feel sorry for him a bit. I mean I get the criticism but it's not his best role so he can't help his poor performances. We are not getting the best out of him, he needs to be moved up-front. There were a few times where RvP was peeling off his marker at the back post but Rooney opted to play the simple sideways pass too. Frustrating stuff all round. He wasn't our worst player out there though.

3746~~~
He's been playing that position for most his career at United, which has seen us have a lot of success. He just needs someone lively, who's good at, both linking up and running in behind. This is why I felt he and Welbeck were awesome together.

3747~~~
Absolutely maddening that van Gaal plays him as a midfielder.

3748~~~
Same old story. had a few good games in midfield and had a few bad games. The same consistency he showed when he was a striker. He'll do no better than what RVP and Falcao have been producing of late. He has been shunted out to the wing for defensive duties (not offensive) because he has no other attribute apart from his so called work rate. The only thing that has surprised me is he hasn't squeaked a word about it to the manager unlike previous seasons.

3749~~~
Because a still doesn't give you a full description of the situation.

3750~~~
Doesn't matter. I will yellwrite this sentence until a pen will be awarded.

3751~~~
I will join you if you allow me. We don't get penalties anymore <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>, where are our divers ?

3752~~~
It's bizarre. Only us and Villa haven't been awarded one. There's one awarded every 5 games.

3753~~~
He just gave up after we lost the ball on one attack in the final minutes. He looked visibly frustrated. The player was near him, Rooney of old would have chased the man down full length of the pitch.
Can't blame him when two people are taking your primary position who can't score to save their lives.

3754~~~
Is Phil Jones our dedicated penalty taker?

3755~~~
What a waste of talent to be running around covering ground when he is most potent in and around the opponent box. I am not sure why LvG can't see that he is clearly not suited for role. Apart from cross field passes to Valencia, he really don't have the vision to make defence splitting passes.

3756~~~
I am one of his biggest fans but he was quite bad yesterday. If LVG thinks Falcao and RVP are better strikers then fair enough bring Rooney on as sub when they get tired or we need to try something different, however there is no point playing him in a role which is not No 10 or 9, specially when we have Blind, Fellaini, Hererra etc who are better suited there.

I think Rooney's performance is also getting affected because he has started realizing that his shift to midfield is probably not a temporary move in eyes of LVG. Not only is he competing with Falcao and RVP but also with Di Maria, Fellaini and Wilson (who have all been preferred up top in some recent games). The funny thing is that none of these players have shown any sort of goal-scoring form playing up front while Rooney was scoring quite a few when he was playing in No 9 or 10.

LVG was right to try him in midfield. But Rooney is not being effective there and our strike-force is not effective up front. Its just a no-brainer now that we drop one of RVP/Falcao (or even both) and try Rooney upfront with proper midfield players behind him.

3757~~~
Rooney has plainly been better up front, yet Van Gaal persists with him on the right side of the diamond. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

You'd understand if Falcao and/or Van Persie were in brilliant form but they're not. Wayne deserves a run up front.

3758~~~
He was pissed off today. Only a matter of time before he rebels. Painfully obvious this isn't working.

3759~~~
Thought he played as well as he could do in midfield really, but that pass when countering to Di Maria was so bad it was damn annoying. It just needed a little touch and he was in, but he overhit it badly and we lost all the momentum. Little thing's like are what makes a good midfielder or not IMO.

3760~~~
I don't think those stats really show that he's been "plainly" better up front, I'm surprised with the amount of chances created from midfield to be honest. That he'd score and assist more from a forward position is pretty logical given his position in the diamond. 

Having said that, you only have to watch the games to realize how ill suited he is to this position in midfield. He's a guy who can do a job there if needed now and again, but making him an out and out midfielder when he still has it in him to be a great goalscorer is a bit silly.

3761~~~
He's useless in midfield. He just isnt good enough so either he plays upfront or not at all. LVG always speaks about balance but Rooney in midfield probably creates the most inbalance

3762~~~
He was right because at the time our CMs weren't fit and in form. Rooney can cover for a few matches and help out for sure.

3763~~~
I don't see many runs into the penalty box where defenders could potentially make a mistake. I think 2 things needed for most penalties (apart from ref's proper view of incident): 

fast runners into the penalty area at full throttle causing panic or through balls cutting across defense where defender have to foul the attacker to avoid 1-1 with GK. Too many crosses United is playing now for defenders to panic, it's easy to settle down and clear crosses.

3764~~~
Sadly too true.

3765~~~
Actually I'd say the further away from playing as a striker that Rooney gets, the more fans overrate his ability as a striker. People forget that he isn't a great striker; thinking that he must be as he's a great player and he isn't a great midfielder/play-maker. People forget his patchy form and positional indiscipline up front caused most people to declare him a great number 10, but merely a good number 9 a few years ago. Then when he was played as a number 10 his poor first touch and average link up play meant he was a poor number 10, but a great number 9. Basically he's great in whatever position he currently isn't playing.

The fact is he's a versatile, hard working but inconsistent player wherever he plays. Being played out of position isn't a reason to regularly fail to make basic 10-15 yard passes. If he were making those basic errors when linking up with a striker he'd be equally poor and frustrating (possibly more so as he'd be spurning good opportunities).

At the moment I agree he should be playing up front, but not because he's some great striker. Mainly because we have better midfielders and our current centre forwards are in poor form.

3766~~~
That just isnt how I remember it at all. In 2011-12 he played up front and scored 34 goals, he was fantastic. When we signed a new striker and pushed him back the following summer some people spoke about SAF not having forgiven him for holding the club to ransom, like it was an act of vindictiveness. Others said, "when a player as good as RVP becomes available you just have to go for it." Either way, people werent talking about us needing a new striker because the one we had wasnt up to it.

3767~~~
Everyone can see it's not difficult to rectify. LVG is acting stubborn for some reason only he knows. You have ADM, Herrera who can easily make those runs, Mata can try those through balls. All it needs is consistent team selection and a formation which players are comfortable with. IMHO

1. Let go of 2 striker theory, just play any one of them.
2. Play either of Rooney/Mata bit advanced, behind the striker. 
3. Hererra, Blind, ADM, Fellaini, Carrick can easily be made to play as part of midfield 4 based on availability and opposition. 
4. Defence as per the best available choices. I think that's good enough for top 3 spot. 

I don't understand what's wrong doing the obvious, one shouldn't act oversmart for his own good.

3768~~~
The pace of his passing is so slow.  He never fizzes a pass to feet.  We all know about the big long slowly floated ball over to valencia but now when he's making a 20 yard sqaure pass to Di Maria / Blind / Januzaj they are floated over to them....knee height straight at them.  So the recieving player has to stand still, take a touch and then look forward.

Its this type of pass that is constantly slowing us down.  The amount of times players have to stand still and wait for passes to trickle / float towards them is redcilous.  It stops all momentum and pace to our attack.  Rooney is by no means the only culprit of this but he's certainly the biggest.

If we are passing to feet we need to be move the ball so much more quickly and really pinging it about.  When countering / going forward it needs to be into the on moving players run so to not break their run / momentum.

This to me is blatently obvious school boy type stuff which we are getting terribly wrong.

We always looks like we are playing in a pre-tournement international friendly on some slow rock hard bobbly pitch.

3769~~~
Rooney's passing is so damn sloppy. He's too slow in the middle, play him up top ffs.

3770~~~
Rooney has played up front for several lengthy periods and has had mixed results. He played a large chunk of the 06/07 and 07/08 seasons as a number 9 and didn't set the world alight. He also alternated the position with Berbatov for the 08/09 season and the start of the 10/11 season and went through lengthy periods of poor form (before Hernandez started playing). The 11/12 season he played up front often as well, on the whole he played very well but again he was inconsistent (if I recall he went through a couple of baron spells where he looked poor mid Sept - mid Dec and end Dec - end Jan). He basically started the season fantastically and finished fantastically which made the season seem brilliant on a whole. The 09/10 season he was great throughout.

Overall people remember the great periods of Rooney as a number 9 and forget the lengthy periods of inconsistency and mediocrity. They forget his positional indiscipline, forget his inability to play as a sole striker, forget his inconsistent first touch and remember maybe 50 games out of the 150 that he's played up front that he was in great form. 

However I watch Rooney and I see a player who when on his game is a 10/10 player in central midfield, as a number 10 or as a number 9. His first touch is immaculate, his finishing phenomenal, long passing is fantastic, work rate/drive/determination are brilliant and short passing is very good. On the top of his game he is Shearer as a centre forward, Scholes in central midfielder and not a million miles away from Messi as a number 10.

The problem is he attains his absolute top level quite rarely and sustains a top level not nearly enough. For his ability Rooney plays a 5/10 infinitely more than 10/10.

3771~~~
That's true for all strikers, not just Rooney. We watch Rooney every single game and at the same time presume every other top striker never goes through a barren spell. Rooney's barren spells are even tougher to judge the likeliood is not all of those games were spent playing as a striker. We have another striker at the club in RVP who goes through his share of barren spells.

He's only had 2 seasons where he's pretty much consistently played up top and he scored 30+ in both the seasons.

And 50 in 150 is a ridiculous figure, one you've pulled out of nowhere.

3772~~~
What is his price and who could afford him? PSG? Surely Coleen likes Paris..

3773~~~
The reason he hasn't played more often as a number 9 is because he's often not been great there. I disagree that he's only had 2 seasons there, after Ruud left he played up front consistently until RVP was signed. The 06/07, 07/08, 08/09, 09/10, 10/11 & 11/12 seasons had Rooney playing up front far more often than not, 4 of these 6 seasons he didn't play great there which culminated in Hernandez playing himself into the position half way through the final season. During that period he played with Berbatov alongside him, Tevez alongside him, Ronaldo behind him, as well as briefly Saha and Hernandez ahead of him. Over this period you could point to 50-60 games where he showed consistency as a number 9: which was all of 09/10, a couple of months at the start of 11/12 and 3 months at the end of 11/12.

Hernandez form in 2010-2011 is a prime example of how playing brilliant will get you a place in the team, regardless. Unfortunately Rooney hasn't shown this level of form in 3 years. The only argument for starting Rooney up front is "everyone else is in poor form and Rooney was great 3 years ago".

3774~~~
That was poor from him yesterday. I think generally he's done pretty well in CM, although sitting too deep. BUT yesterday was poor. Herrera should have come on and him go up top at half time! Falcao or RVP could have been subbed, given Rooney a chance up top and then if that not worked then bring on Fellaini as what happened anyway. (Or even Fellaini into CM at half time and then further forward later if required). 

If he doesnt go up top against Leicester I think LVG is being stubborn once again, cos he cant argue RVP or Falcao had a good game so why they should be rewarded with another start, and cant argue Rooney is doing well in CM at the moment as he's been average the last few games. Why not switch it round.

At home I would hope we wouldnt start Fellaini up top and play long balls against Burnley, I'd hope wed have enough to white wash them with attacking football.

3775~~~
Disagree with this, after Ruud left Ronaldo, Tevez, Berbatov and even Saha were playing upfront while Rooney was often shunted to the left wing because Ronaldo was a liability playing on the wing. Yes he did play the odd game upfront in that period but he wasn't consistently played there for 30+ games, when he did he was pretty good.

3776~~~
Youre going back 7, 8, 9 years to assess his contribution as a striker. At that time, yes, he looked more like a second striker. But for me it is largely irrelevant considering his most recent spell up front dispelled any doubt about where he should be playing. His inability to play as a solo striker? He proved himself more than capable of playing that role then. Some people felt the rest of his game suffered when playing up there which is a separate argument, but in his primary task of scoring goals he excelled. 

Maybe he had a bit of a lull in the middle of the season but I dont remember it being a huge one, his stats for the season were very good. As <a class="username" data-user="69862, @akash02" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@akash02</a> said, that happens to every striker. I really dont think this is a case of rose-tinted hindsight, all things considered the facts point to his best position being up top.

3777~~~
The only thing he lacks as a number 9 is the ability play well with his back to goal. Which is where his indiscipline comes from. If the team is playing well he'll stay up top and not drop deep but the worse our performance is the deeper he comes. I prefer him as a #10 in an any case even if it means fewer goals.

It's pretty much a fact. He's only had 2 season of consistently playing there. At various points, you've had Saha, Larsson, Tevez, Berbatov, RVP all play in front of him. Then there was also the period where Fergie stuck Ronaldo up top and played Rooney out wide although this was mainly in the CL games.  Not that he hasn't played there at all. He has but not had a long run of games there. So unless you can come up with some sort of stats of how many games he played as  #9 and how many goals/assists he has in just those games, it's all a bit pointless.

Or you could aalso say, Rooney was great the last time he played there. He also started last season playing up top and scoring goals before moving deeper as the season went on.

3778~~~
Again this is a myth. Berbatov and Rooney both played a 9.5's the majority of the time, Tevez and Rooney both played as 9.5's more often than not. You could count the number of games Ronaldo played as a centre forward on both hands and during the stated period Saha started around 25 league games.

And you're using a period 5 years ago to assess his ability as a centre forward, or looking very favourably on a season 3 years ago.

I could understand one manager having a blind spot to his qualities as a centre forward; but all three of our managers have dismissed the option of playing him up front. Fergie tried him there after Ruud left and with mixed results signed Hernandez and then RVP; Moyes tried him there but he ended up playing in other positions more often than not and now Van Gaal has tried him anywhere but the strikers position. Fans must accept there is something these people don't see in him that they do (or vice versa)?

He lacks many qualities to be a great number 9. He can't play with his back to goal, his first touch is too poor to play as a lone striker, his short passing often breaks down quick attacks and his positional indiscipline means that frequently he isn't in the box when you need him to be.

Again I don't agree that it's a fact he's only played 2 seasons as a number 9 and he wasn't great last time he played there, he was inconsistent. Which is exactly the problem with Rooney in any position he plays. I accept that almost every striker goes through dry patches, but with Rooney it wasn't just his failure to score during these (too frequent) periods, it was the fact that his level can drop to such a low that negatively effects the team far more when you're the focal point.

In my opinion a wide forward role  would probably be the most forgiving for Rooney, given his inconsistencies but terrific work rate.

3779~~~
His first touch is quite good. Just because he has the odd stinker does not mean he has a poor first touch. Breaks down quick attacks? That's just complete nonsense. Some of the best counter attacks and fast paced goals we've scored have involved Rooney. His short passing is more than good enough when he plays as a #9 or #10 because it's mostly based on instinct. It's when he plays CM that it becomes suspect. Again, his positional indiscipline only comes to the fore when the team is playing shite and he feels the need to drop back.

You may not agree but it's the truth. Also, not the word consistent. He's only had 2 seasons of consistently playing there. That's irrefutable.

He's best as a #10 where he brings balance to the team while contributing plenty of goals and assists.

3780~~~
You have to bang your head against the wall when you go to a place like west ham and play Wayne Rooney at centre mid. Shocking. We should've played a three man midfield yesterday of Blind, Fellaini and Herrera. Rooney up front on his own, Di Maria and Januzaj on the sides. We were bloody awful and LVG is starting to get on my nerves.

3781~~~
To be fair, he scored 34 goals in 43 games, with a midfield of Cleverley, Anderson, Carrick, Young, Giggs and Park supporting him. You can call that 'inconsistent' if you want, but it was a fantastic return.

3782~~~
I just occassionally laugh at the fact that we have the current leading Premier League goalscorer who will most likely go on to break not only our record but the Premier League record for goals sat as a defensive central midfielder. It's pathetic.

3783~~~
His first touch is very poor. Di Maria, RVP and Mata have a good first touch, it is one of Rooney's biggest flaws.

He's only had 2 full seasons playing 100% a number 9 because of form, nothing else (although I class playing as a 9.5 as no different to a centre forward; I certainly wouldn't say Cole and Yorke were playing out of position). You can't play someone in a position for a full season, if for 3-4 months they look poor and/or inconsistent in that position, particularly when it is arguably the most important position on the pitch. Rooney is fortunate in the sense that when he's out of form as a striker, he drops back as a number 10 or number 8 to take him out of the spotlight. Most player's when out of the form get dropped back to the bench, but Rooney's qualities mean he is a benefit to the team wherever he plays.

I've said many times before: Rooney isn't at his best in any particular position. Rooney is at his best when Rooney is at his best. When he hits this form he's a joy to watch as a midfielder, wide forward, play-maker or centre forward. Unfortunately he's a player who has never been able to sustain great form. In nearly 11 seasons at the club you could probably point to 3 great seasons, 3 good season and 4.5 mediocre seasons. One of those truly great seasons he was a number 9, one he was a number 10 and one he played both. Likewise with the 3 good seasons and likewise with the mediocre ones.

3784~~~
Falcao up front is costing us points now, and RVP to a degree. It's obvious we are struggling to create chances, so the chances we do create <i>need</i> to be scored. Rooney does just that. For the next game I would like to see Rooney pushed up with RVP and Falcao dropped. Fellaini and Blind into midfield with Herrera, Di Maria and Mata playing behind Rooney. Make sure Rooney stays up top, because that heat-map from BBC is showing that Falcao, Di Maria and RVP are getting in each others way.

3785~~~
Im using one period, which is the most recent one available where he played in the position in question. That strikes me as being more rational than leapfrogging it entirely and looking at 2 or 3 seasons before that where he was played in a number of different positions and was still developing as a young player. 

However I will concede your second para does pose problems for me. In isolation each manager's treatment of Rooney can be explained easily enough but taken together, as you said, it does look like the managers see something the fans dont.

3786~~~
Doesnt change the fact that all three managers, who have made a living managing football teams and doubtlessly know a lot more about football than I do, look wrong from where Im sitting. So I will continue to hope (though with almost zero expectation) to see Rooney played up front on his own in the next game, and in every upcoming game until the facts change - i.e. till Rooney has been tried there and has failed, or until one of the other strikers makes himself undroppable.

3787~~~
They see a squad that is profoundly flawed with a talented, versatile and extremely hard-working footballer able to help try and paper over the cracks?

3788~~~
We don't even know if our squad is flawed, we keep picking players out of position rather than trusting the specialists we have.

Shunting Di Maria and Rooney as our best two attacking players, and leaving Mata (our next best) out of the team is unforgivable IMO.

3789~~~

3790~~~
Was thinking Engalnd game may be a good thing to get him back up top.

However with Kane and Sturridge (Who could make a good pair) - will Hodgson mix Rooney up in CM for England?

3791~~~
He used him out wide at the World Cup to play Sterling through the middle, I'm sure he'd do similar to get Kane and Sturridge in.

3792~~~
Evidently. God knows where they are getting that from. 

Seriously though. Three managers have successively declined, on the whole, to play Rooney up front which is where I think he plays best. I dont find his midfield performances as awful as many on here do but let's face it, it isnt optimal for him. If the problem is there is nobody else in the squad with the qualities he has in midfield, there have been windows when this could have been addressed. But I dont think that is really the problem. We can cobble together a midfield without him in it, the reason he isnt playing up front is Van Gaal doesnt fancy him there, not that he cant be spared from midfield, IMO.

3793~~~
I was looking at his career as a whole, but yes I agree he was good the last time he played as a number 9 consistently. However I also think he was one of the better player's last season as a number 10.

I think it's also pertinent that fans still argue where Rooney's best position is after watching him for 11 years. If there were a straightforward answer it would have been conclusively answered half a decade ago. A number of them say it's as a number 9, quite a lot say it's as a number 10 and then there's people like myself that think it's neither. Rooney is the only Footballer I can think of that doesn't actually have a position.

Rooney is a bizarre hybrid of several types of player's, which actually makes him good but not great in almost any position. If you could swap a couple of his qualities with a couple of his weaknesses you could have the perfect number 8, number 10, number 9 or wide forward. Bizarrely however he has a (or a couple of) key weaknesses for each of these positions, whilst possessing an array of strengths which aren't natural to a player of these specific positions.

3794~~~
That's how I feel: versatile player who can help out if needed for a few games, but his default position should remain CF.

3795~~~
It's hard to believe that a player as talented as Rooney is being used as a utility man. Egregious. 

And he is genuinely average in central midfield.

3796~~~
This is how I feel about Rooney too.

3797~~~
It takes a full season to make him a natural CM at Football Manager 2015. Calm down guys. <span style="color: #ffffff">Lolz</span>

3798~~~
Does anyone remember these quotes from Van Gaal, in regards to letting Welbeck go?

"He played here for three seasons after (his loan to) Sunderland, but he doesn’t have the record of Van Persie or <b>Rooney</b> and that is the standard".

If that's the standard, then why are we playing one of our best goalscorers so fecking deep?

3799~~~
I know stats aren't everything, but on paper that shows what a bloody good go he is giving it. Taking the captain's duty seriously and rolling his sleeves up. Good to see.

He should be playing up front though, at least we should be trying him there whilst we are in this slump.

3800~~~
Agreed, right now he should definitely be playing up front just to get us a bit of momentum if nothing else, but I think those stats highlight the fact that, if RVP and Fatcao were scoring from the chances we create, it wouldn't be a problem that he's playing in CM.

3801~~~
It would, he is still giving the ball away far too much and already has cost us a goal because of it.

3802~~~
Other than the fact that he's crap there and we would be better off playing actual midfielders? It's hindering the team playing Wayne Rooney (oh, he's not playing up top, yet his touch and awareness continues to be shocking for a player who's meant to be the answer up front). It's all well and good saying that the manager sees this and that in training but when it's plain obvious to most people that it's not working game in and game out then the manager's just being stubborn and refusing to drop big names like Rooney and Falcao. Seems like shoving him in midfield is the only way to put the 3 main guys in the team right now, and if we replaced say Rooney and Falcao with Herrera, Fellaini and/or Mata the performances would no doubt go up a notch, along with a proper right back who has cojones. I'd actually love to know what happens on the training pitch because surely this can't go on... It's almost torture to watch and we continue to be one of the most boring teams to watch with some of our better players sitting on the bench.

3803~~~
So almost a goal/assist a game when playing in forward positions and yet LVG drops him for misfiring forwards. If we miss out on top four it will be down to this. Turning your most competent offensive threat at the time to a holding midfielder is ridiculous.

3804~~~
His most productive game this season came as a midfielder against Newcastle. He scored 2 in 5 up top, so hardly much of an improvement is it?

3805~~~
What?

3 goals and 1 assist in 11 apps as a cm with most of that coming in one game vs 5 goals and 3 assists in 9 apps as a striker/no10 isn't a big difference?

Rooney as cm in the Newcastle game only worked as he was allowed to get into the box, Van Gaal has him playing as a holding mid now. No wonder he hasn't registered a shot on goal this year.

3806~~~
Yes, he registered his best game for us this season as a midfielder. He was not any better than our current strikers when he played there, that's what I meant. God knows why he's holding midfield just now. Just makes no sense. Probably why LVG's doing it.

3807~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B9aFwQEIIAAQLPx.png" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B9aFwQEIIAAQLPx.png"/>

3808~~~
Rooney's best season was when we played him alone on top. Best game, this season is so subjective. I think we should drop RvP/Falcao and move Rooney up.

3809~~~
Of all the times he's thrown his toys out of the pram, I'm surprised he hasn't done it yet. A stronger manager than Hodgson wouldn't pick him for England with Kane and Sterling doing well. They'd pick players in form playing in those positions.

He's not a CM. He doesn't have the patience and the concentration for it. He barely tackles. His contribution is to sweep the ball out wide in a team that doesn't play wingers.

I really hope he's still doing the things in training he does as a forward, because I'm worried he'll get a chance there, look rusty and then he's back in CM again floundering.

3810~~~
Hey, cmon. He might be slow, he might be lumbering, he be past his best... but that's out of order!

3811~~~
That would be a bit short sighted. Form should have its say in NT selections, but if you base it uniquely on that, you're never going to achieve any semblance of team game as you'll have randomers picked up now and then. Rooney is the captain of the national side, unless it's under extreme circumstances (and I don't think the current situation really registers as such), he should be called up.

3812~~~

3813~~~
Just get him the feck out of midfield.

3814~~~
I hope this is true...

3815~~~
Scholes just said Rooney should be playing as a striker and is being wasted in midfield.

3816~~~
It's just stating the obvious at this point, haven't a clue why LVG keeps persisting with it.

3817~~~
United playing non-risky football 

Scholes: BT Sport

3818~~~
Teams are good as their 2 strikers. United's front 2 have not been good enough.

Scholes: BT Sport

3819~~~
He's right, obviously.

3820~~~
Would like to see a midfield of Herrera, Blind and Di Maria, with Mata at the top of the diamond, and then Rooney playing just off of either Falcao or Van Persie. Has to be better than what we've seen so far.

3821~~~
Please yes!!

3822~~~
He also mentioned balls. I'm not sure he meant United players lacking in these or was referring to another team.

3823~~~
3rd in the club's all time top goalscorer list.

He needs to play up front.

3824~~~
Ffs should've happened long ago. Play the real midfielders in midfield please. Falcao should be dropped.

3825~~~
Centre back it is then.

3826~~~
I reckon I'll be celebrating like we scored if he's not in centre midfield tonight. Come on Van Gaal, make it happen.

3827~~~
Playing as a DM now that Herrera's come on. All so Falcao and RvP can sit up front. It's mental this.

Surely it'll start being addressed by more people soon?

3828~~~
Pure stupidity to play him in midfield. He messes up the easy passes nowadays, it hurts watching

3829~~~
Would be pissed if I was him.

3830~~~
He isn't a striker nor an attacker in LVG's mind, that much is clear now. He is a midfielder.

3831~~~
He's not anywhere near being in his most comfortable position, but still, he can't even pass the ball 5 yards right now. In atrocious form.

3832~~~
Wayne of all trades is now being asked to play as Pirlo.

3833~~~
Weren't fecking far off. Defensive midfielder now. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

And people wonder why he gets pissed off, when he could more than likely be at a top club playing up top.

3834~~~
He'll end up in goal soon enough.

3835~~~
I don't care if he's in midfield, he has been dire. His touch has been shite and his passing awful too.

3836~~~
New Scholes they said...

3837~~~
Common sense. De Gea AND Rooney in goal, Falcao and RvP up top. 

Philosophy, mate.

3838~~~
He's bound to soon be feeling angry and confused again

3839~~~
This is something Moyes would do. Shocking.

3840~~~
At least 10 games still to play defense.

3841~~~
Defensive midfielder. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3842~~~
Totally warranted in this case. If the CM nonsense continues throughout the whole season he'd be mad not to look elsewhere.

He's being totally wasted here right now - sacrificed for inferior players.

3843~~~
Not only is he in midfield, he's also in his annual crap patch.
I don't believe he's quite <i>this </i>bad in midfield. But add his 'can barely control a high ball or pass first time' mode, and it's painful to watch.

3844~~~
Working his cock off but just wasted in midfield.

3845~~~
Man marking Danny Ings ffs.

3846~~~
This is hilarious tbf<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3847~~~
Funnily enough, I thought he did a good job defensively all said and done. Just looks so awkward though

3848~~~
Rooney to play DM in the next game?

3849~~~
Can't complain about his drive or how hard he tries, but he's just better in front of goal as Striker/AM

3850~~~
He wasn't bad, but it's a waste. A total waste. Fellaini, Mata, Januzaj, Di Maria, Falcao, Van Persie, Wilson. They've all been given a go as a striker or a no.10 in recent weeks. The only one who hasn't is the guy who has been averaging a goal/assist per game in those positions for years.

3851~~~
Did he pass forward once today? The amount of times he tries to spin on the ball and play the hospital pass back to Jonny fecking Evans is unreal. His passing stinks.

3852~~~
Falcao got an assist today. He's almost 0.75 goals/assists per starts y'know. Stats

3853~~~
Too many misplaced passes and not a midfielder's movement. Let's hope he plays upfront and our other strikers get benched

3854~~~
If Rooney had been putting in striking performances as poor as the ones RvP and Falcao have been in recent weeks, you'd be among the first to slate him. Fact is, at this moment i'd back him to do better in the role than both of those two currently are. But he's not even being given the chance, because he's apparently of more use playing just in front of the defence.

3855~~~
Horrible today, he needs to be moved close to the goal.

3856~~~
Better than Falcao maybe, but who wouldn't?

3857~~~
Awful tonight but supposedly had to do a job. But not his fault - he's not refined enough to play there. Back up front with RVP for Preston please, with Mata behind them and Blind, Herrera, Di Maria CM.

3858~~~
He'd be an improvement on Van Persie as well probably, who's hardly been pulling up trees - indeed, RvP's goal return from open play is only marginally better than Rooney's, despite him playing as a striker every week.

3859~~~
Pity that redcafe doesn't allow negative ratings because both him and Falcao would get negative for today

3860~~~
But that's just guess work isn't it? RVP would play better too if he wasn't playing alongside a useless Falcao.

3861~~~
Difference is one's a striker/no.10 playing as a defensive midfielder, and one's a striker playing as a striker.

3862~~~
My point, though, is that Rooney isn't even getting his turn up front. I could understand if RvP and Falcao were setting the world alight, but they're not. Far from it.

3863~~~
I would like Rooney to play as a striker but it still doesn't mean that he makes such silly basic errors that no professional football player should be making

3864~~~
Yeah but for whatever reason, no matter what form he's been in, whenever Rooney goes back into midfield his whole game goes to shit. He's just a completely different player up front and in midfield, happens every time.

3865~~~
Stop pissing about with him in midfield it is an absolute waste. A passenger in the game, Charlie Adam would do the same job.

3866~~~
I feel sorry for Rooney, he has spent virtually his whole career playing up front. Its where his intuition and instinct have been built up of years of working up there and now he is having to work in midfield to the point of having to drop back to DM. I thought he was working hard today but making the sorts of mistakes that we would expect to see RvP or any other striker make if they had to play as a DM.  I appreciate his effort but its not fair on him to make him do this job.  I doubt he is enjoying this and most players play best when they play with a bit of enjoyment.

3867~~~
He would do better.

3868~~~
Too many people are excusing him. He was awful, a terrible display. Nothing to suggest he would improve our attack either. He looks slow and his touch is rubbish. 

Selling him in the summer would not be a bad thing.

3869~~~
Worked is arse off but couldn't pass water tonight.

3870~~~
You really don't think being played as a defensive midfielder is any kind of mitigation at all? 

Sacrificing his own game for the good of the team, and getting dogs abuse for his trouble.

3871~~~
Can be checked in my history record that I'm hardly a Rooney fan/defender but the way he's playing at the moment, 90% of the fault goes to LVG's drawer for me. 

Especially given that our strikers aren't tearing the teams a new one each game and Falcao looks really bad.

3872~~~
Imagine how pissed he will be if he misses out on the Utd goal scoring record because of this. You could argue a lot of Utd fans wouldn't want him holding it anyway, but missing that record will hurt him bad.

3873~~~
He's a terrible midfielder. He really has no range of passing. The only decent pass he has on him is his the predictable cross field ball to Valencia on the right wing. Apart from that he can't and absolutely refuses to play balls between the lines. It must suck being a number 10 and playing infront of Rooney because you know you will never get the ball.

3874~~~
He did better as a defensive midfielder than a conventional midfielder. 

Don't get any ideas Louis..

3875~~~
At this rate he will end the season in goal.

3876~~~

3877~~~
He wanted to leave last summer, he didn't care about it then, he stayed because we are paying him 250k per week.

3878~~~

3879~~~
There was a moment today in the middle of the second half where Januzaj had the ball and was waiting to make a little 2-3 yard run to get in to space, Rooney just stood there and eventually Januzaj had to try to dribble his way out of trouble. That sortve sums up Rooney in midfield to me, that and he can't pass or take care of the ball when under pressure.

3880~~~
I'm waiting for the game where LvG rotates Rooney at every outfield position.

3881~~~
In our last two Premier League games I've heard the commentator talk about how Rooney can play anywhere, and it's quite common to hear this, but the simple fact is that he can't. Not to the standard we require, anyway. He's decent defensively, especially for a striker, which is presumably the only reason people say this. He doesn't know how to play the midfield role properly and he's wasted the further away from goal he gets

3882~~~
It's simple really, he is just an awful passer of the ball, the only passes that look good are those long ones to the right, his biggest preference is Valencia, but those passes are so easily read and often hit so that the receiver has to stand still to get it, take it down and build up speed after that and that just takes too much time to come to anything. 

Should be played upfront but only by default (as our other strikers are poo) , all though we should simply have a better allround player than the current Rooney in our starting line-up.

3883~~~
I'm absolving him from all blame for this idiocy. He'll be in goals by Easter. Lunacy.

3884~~~
I fail to see how. He is not a midfielder! 

One thing that annoys me is the constant crap said by the British commentators "We know that Wayne Rooney can play any position..." no, he can't. I mean anyone can play there if they are forced to but he doesn't play it adequately. He is a striker FFS.

3885~~~
and watch him playing striker and being awful.. He is better as striker tho but in the two strikers system quite useless. He would need to see somone pacy like Wilson next to him but that will never happen because we would need to bench both Falcao and RVP.

Van Gaal also said in the early stage of the season that Rooney's best position is as CAM, and I agree with that just because we played with fellaini two good games and than he got injured he decided for no reason to drop rooney deeper to get "muscles" and balance there. Such a BS from old man. 

IMO Rooney should play as CAM in this system - that is the last position he can play for us. If we switch to 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 than may he play as striker not as a 10 where technical ability is needed and what he really lacks. Right now as ten he is good option because he still has got some energy about him and can press the defenders up front unlike very slow mata, and actually can do some job defending but not that much when he plays deep like now and make good runs to the box in which he is very good as well as shooting from distance which he sadly don't show at all as he's getting old..

3886~~~
At this rate he's going to end up being De Gea's replacement.

3887~~~
Watching him play in midfield was as bad as seeing Jesus suffer in <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>. This madness has to stop soon.

Has Sir Bobby ordered Van Gaal to make sure that Rooney must not come near his goalscoring record or what? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Not trying to defend Falcao. Rooney is very negative in midfield and seemingly the only forward pass is his infamous diagonal which every full back reads.

3889~~~
The new Vidic?

3890~~~
More like that scene with Monica Bellucci in Irreversible.

3891~~~
looks like he'd be close to offside but ffs worth a pass. he's a striker not a midf.

3892~~~
Fair enough. Just pointing out some very obvious limitations in his abilities as a midfielder.

3893~~~
That was a very tough one to watch too.

3894~~~
I have a sick friend who has what we could call a 'r' section in his extensive DVD library. That is in there along with I Spit on Your Grave, Last House on the Left and other such titles. Oh, and Island of Death, if you've ever seen that low budget shocker.

3895~~~
Well it isn't worth a pass since he is offside. There is no point trying to pass to someone who is offside.

3896~~~
Credit to him for not throwing the dummy out the pram, he's willingly done everything instructed of him, patiently watching over our poor strikers non existent performances and played practically every position on the pitch whilst he really should be chasing Bobby Charlton's record.

I really wanted him to take the penalty instead of Robin Van Persie, I was surprised he didn't.

Nevertheless, I hope this experiment is over, Herrera should be playing if we want a midfielder with balance. Rooney should be #9 at the moment and Mata should be brought back in as #10.

3897~~~
Midfield or no midfield, since he got the armband he's showing great maturity. Always doing his job without any comments and generally putting in some solid performances even in positions he is not used to playing.

3898~~~
He used to play those passes to Hernandez when they struck a partnership in 2011. Its sad to see him completely castrated of all creativity in his current role.

3899~~~
He is about as creative as Tom Cleverley when played in midfield.

3900~~~
Watching the game again, defensively he did an excellent job. Tracked his runners, pressed players, tackles, interceptions, discipline etc.. were all to a fairly high level but what was very obvious was that the deeper he went, the worse he looked on the ball. When he got the ball he couln't wait to get rid of it and about 90% of the passes went backwards (or so it seemed). I don't understand how Van Gaal can't see this. Like most attacking players, Rooney relies on instinct and his instincts fail him when he's playing so deep. Another fairly obvious observation was the way Herrera and Rooney received passes. Herrera instinctively knows what's around him and hence has more time to pick out the right pass. Rooney doesn't appear to have a clue and hence all those backward passes when he receives posession.

3901~~~
Can't remember the last time Rooney had a shot on target! Yes he is playing in midfield but plenty of midfielders score goals so Rooney can do better than he is showing currently.

The United Scoring record books might not have his name at the top! if his new life in midfield is anything to go by.

3902~~~
Not a midfielder, dont play him there.

Number 10 or as a Striker.

3903~~~
It's bizarre isn't it? Apparently professional Footballers suddenly lose the ability to play simple 5-10 yard passes, be able to link up with their teammates, can't trap a bag of sand and become thick as pig muck in terms of pass selection merely because they are 40 yards deeper than they'd prefer to be.

If he were up front at the moment we'd be lambasting Van Gaal to move him out wide or to the bench, because on current form every one of our attacks would break down when the ball was played into him, or whenever he tried to link up with his strike partner. I really don't understand why people think that even though he can't make a simple pass in midfield, but he'd suddenly be great further forward linking up with Di Maria, Januzaj and/or RVP.

He's just going through his annual 4-8 weeks of playing like a pub player, which happens regardless of where he plays every season. If he continues to play in this position by March people will be saying "he's finally learning the midfield role", when in actual fact he will have just gotten out of his annual stink.

I bet Rooney is over the moon at the moment, as his crap patch can be blamed on his position. A bit of a get out of jail free card really.

3904~~~
Louis' happy with his midfield performances
I don't see how there is a "problem in midfield". Herrera, Mata, Di Maria, Fellaini, he could even play Pereira since he has given some of the other youngsters some opportunities. They are all actual midfield options. Mata isn't exactly a central midfielder either, but I think he would use the ball better in midfield than Rooney has. Rooney <i>is</i> the midfield problem. He hesitates and hesitates, then just smacks it diagonal, and it's usually too short. He doesn't posses the skill to pick his passes and release the ball quickly. Herrera looked much more effective in that role when he came on.

3905~~~
But those quotes confirm that Van Gaal *knows* Rooney is better as a striker, but that he's asking Rooney to sacrifice playing in his best position to help the 'balance of the team'. Rooney is doing this with no complaints, and generally getting stuck into the 'dirty jobs' (hustling, tracking back, blocking, clearing, tackling, etc) - and as I said previously, getting dogs abuse for his trouble.

Maybe we should be lauding his professionalism, unselfishness and versatility.

3906~~~
Van Gaal obviously doesn't see it that way, and playing any of the other options may present their own set of problems, which are 'on balance' worse than the ones we get playing Rooney in that position.

3907~~~
I agree with that. I'm not slagging Rooney off when I criticise his midfield performances. I'm a big fan of him and think he's a great forward, but it's clear that he is way off what he is capable of in this position. I find it worrying that Van Gaal prefers a restricted Rooney over our actual midfield options.

But you're right. Rooney has gone about his duty with no fuss, which is something that wouldn't have happened in previous years, and that's a credit to him. I'd be interested to know if he is happy playing this role, or if he is keeping it under wraps because of his responsibility as the captain. He's said before that he wants to be scoring goals, and I can't imagine that will have changed.

3908~~~
I commend Rooney for doing what the manager tells him and not complaining, being a good captain.
However him playing in midfield is worse than the other options for me, he has already cost us a goal by giving the ball away and almost did again yesterday, and has also done it a few other times.

Its not really a critisim of Rooney tbh, its not his fault, that is where is he being asked to play. The stick should be directed at the manager.
We have underperforming strikers up top, decent midfielders on the bench, and a top class stirker playing in midfield. At no point during that kind of setup (except maybe against Newcastle and first half vs Spurs) has our team looked balanced. Infact I would say we look even more unbalanced now with this setup.

3909~~~
Totally agree with your last statement.

I just find it so worrying Van Gaal sees "balance" with Rooney in the midfield.  like I have mentioned in numerous other posts... what is Mata, Fellaini and Herrera thinking when they see these statements?  I mean how does Van Gaal still have the dressing room?

3910~~~
4 years ago to the day <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3911~~~
I think he reached rock bottom last night. Both he and Herrera seemed to be playing as holding midfielders when Blind went off. Why did it need them both? LVG's "philosophy" and set up to not lose games rather than win them.

Yes, he's showing professionalism, unselfishness, etc. and he's "doing a job". But so is Valencia when he plays right back, yet he continues to play there (though not last night) like Rooney in midfield. How many players remain in the team "doing a job" for LVG, "helping the balance of the team", when there are others who actually play in those positions? Crazy. Rooney slows everything down, all the moves, turning back, shielding the ball, before passing. He is not and never will be a midfield player. He is the cause of all our problems in the style of play.

Stick him back up top with Falcao or Wilson as his partner.

I love Rooney as a striker and because he gives his all, but please Louis not in the midfield!!!

3912~~~
Can't even get a shot on target these days though.

3913~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> 
I remember watching this at Footage in Manchester, felt like the whole place was going to collapse when that happened! great memories.

3914~~~
I miss that Rooney.

3915~~~
He was really quite crap in that game, but then he came out with that. As he jumped up I remember quickly thinking how stupid it was to even attempt it, then it just went into the net. Glorious <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3916~~~
At this rate he will end up in the goalkeeping position. Hey atleast we have a replacement for De Gea should he join Madrid. But hey seriously, Way Rooney can play any position. Or something like that.

3917~~~
really - RVP scored in an offside position so did ozil. let the lino make a call. sometimes they f it up. hence it's worth it.

3918~~~
I have been saying that he shouldn't be blamed due to lvg using him shockingly. But sometimes I do wonder if we should have given him the huge contract we did. He's not really one of the world's best week in week out. He's seemingly lost the mobility to play uptop according to our manager (although I'm not sure about that) and he's such a mediocre sloppy and static central midfielder.

3919~~~
He is being extremely professional, doing something he is obviously not confortable with without complaint, but, and through no fault of his own, he is awful in midfield, if LVG is not going to play him upfront then sell him.

3920~~~
A goal I never tire of seeing.

I love that little slump of the arms Berbatov does. Probably annoyed that Nani didn't pass it to him instead.

3921~~~
I really wonder what reason Van Gaal has for playing him there (midfield). Pretty much everyone talks about how poor hes been there, so why keep it up? Is it to shoehorn RvP and Falcao into the side? It's mental, because right now, neither of them deserve to be starting. Next game i would like to see

-----Defence + DDG-----
-----Blind-----Herrera----
Januzaj---Mata----ADM--
----------Rooney---------

4231 or 4411.

3922~~~
LvG's latest comments make it pretty clear he doesn't rate Fellaini or Herrera all that highly as CM's. I don't think it says much about how he sees Mata though as Mata is not a CM. I'd also say the fact he had Rooney and Herrera play so deep suggests he has very little faith in the CB's and in truth they haven't given him any reason to trust them. 

I think people are going from one extreme to the other though pushing Rooney all the way up to a pure #9 role, he's only played there one season and has said numerous times he likes a deeper, second striker role, hence why he seemed to enjoy the partnership with Hernandez so much.

3923~~~
To be fair on the centre backs. The whole decision not to use our actual midfielders places so much more onus on them. It affects their performance. If we actually played a real midfield that could contest the middle instead of this bizarre line up that makes it non-existent, the pressure on the defence would be so much less. Right now we subject them to unnecessary threat because we play a midfield line up that can't control the tempo or screen the back line.

3924~~~
Link?

3925~~~
Who are the members of this fantasy midfield lineup that can control the tempo and screen the back line?

3926~~~
This is what baffles me.

3927~~~
Good grief Pogue you're testing my patience here. Are you on your period or what? As it is right now Rooney's lack of positional awareness both in defence and link up really hurt us. This isnt helped when we play Di Maria and Januzaj who are purely offensive players alongside him. Playing Blind at the base of midfield seems more like a token effort to make our line up resemble a proper midfield. Having players like Ander, Carrick and yes Fellaini who an actually hold up the ball and know how to position themselves would go a long way towards establishing some control.

3928~~~
The really annoying thing is that as well as Rooney not being a midfielder and as a result really struggling since he's having to play in central midfield, the fact is we could really do with him up front.

What ever else you might think of Rooney, he's still a really good finisher and he'd be more mobile and dynamic up front than RVP and Falcao.

3929~~~
That really tested your patience?!? Sure you're not the one feeling hormonal?

Carrick's been crocked for almost the whole season but we played our best football when he was fit so yeah, having him in the team definitely helps. Feck all use when he's not playing, mind you. Fellaini gives us a lot more presence but controlling the tempo and screening the backline are probably the two weakest aspects of his game.

Which leaves us with Hererra and Blind. Blind has been great but isn't the quickest and won't win many headers in midfield. Herrera loves getting forward and seems more comfortable as a 10 than playing any deeper. They're both handy players to have (especially Blind, who seems to have adapted to the PL much quicker than Hererra) but it's obvious to me that our options in central midfield are a long way short of where they should be. Especially when you compare them to the teams ahead of us in the league. We've a bunch of players with different qualities but are clearly missing a touch of class and it's no surprise that we haven't found a settled and effective midfield combination this season.

3930~~~
IF we buy a top class midfielder in the summer, can we see Rooney being played more forward next year, just in behind a (new) striker?

3931~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It was that and another thread. 

Anyway. Yes Blind isn't the quickest, but like Carrick, his awareness more than makes up for it. Both of them are very good at closing off passing lanes with their positioning and their anticipation allows them to get on opponents quickly enough. I'll grant you that Fellaini isn't the best at screening the back line but that's what Blind and Carrick are there for. They, however, require other players like Fellaini and Ander for the presence and intelligence required in the middle. Ander looks to prefer to roam and keep himself around the ball wherever it is IMO. He's a very good mobile creator who offers us excellent vision and movement. Not sure why we can't play Blind/Carrick, Ander, Di Maria and Fellaini together in midfield. It pisses me off to no end that we're trying to shoehorn Falcao, RVP and Rooney. Personally, Falcao should be dropped without a second thought. Rooney needs to be playing up front. 

I agree that this still leaves us far short when compared to the teams ahead of us. We could bring in better midfielders but the concerning thing is how we would use them. We already have a decent midfield and yet we're choosing to feck around with our selection and our play style.

3932~~~
See I'd agree with almost all of that. Especially the bit about dropping Falcao. Although I can understand why he's giving him every chance to prove himself. Partly because he was a monster of a player fairly recently and is still only 28, partly because Mendes kicked up an almighty fuss when Falcao was dropped earlier on in the season and we're trying to keep him sweet so we can get De Gea's new contract across the line.

3933~~~
Worry with that is DDG may not sign before the end of the season for other reasons. I think <i>IF</i> this is a major reason for playing Falcao, then we should grow a pair and drop him to try out different personnel in his position.

3934~~~
I can see LVG holding out for Falcao to help him find his form. But the problem goes deeper than that. Our "style of play" doesn't exactly help Falcao rediscover form either because we're not putting chances out for him. Heck we're not even playing attacking football for any striker to benefit on a regular basis. I'd imagine Falcao would have much less of a problem getting back to his monster mode if he was in Costa's position at Chelsea. 

Louis' philosophy, so called, is the root of most of our problems. I'd prefer it if he just told us to be more direct and stopped with the bizarre line ups.

3935~~~
Have a good look at that video again and check where Falcao is when Rooney receives the ball. Falcao is 2-3 meters offside at that moment. Rooney got it exactly right. That example is a very poor one to use.

3936~~~
The guy at the top is playing Falcao on.

3937~~~
Watch the footage of the game again on a full sized screen and you will see that Falcao is 2-3 meters offside when Rooney first receives the ball. I thought the same as you when I watched the gif but went and watched the full sized replay and its really clear. Rooney chose the right option.

3938~~~
Falcao wouldn't have gotten to a through ball anyway.

Depressing that Wayne didn't try it though.

3939~~~
He probably wouldn't have, but then it's a pass that Di Maria, januzaj and Herrera would try. I'd say Rooneys probably told to keep it simple but he tries cross field balls quite often and they barely come off anymore.

3940~~~
The thing I realise I should have clarified earlier is that the point people are making about us being too safe and cautious I completely agree with, just dont think this is a fair example

3941~~~
Some players do try to express themselves more. Some say LVG is stifling the creative players and in some ways it's true when Rooney is passing sideways and backwards all the time and Herrera, Mata are sitting on the bench but Januzaj, Di Maria still try things. Unless they are given permission to take more risks.

Fair enough. I'm not going to look for the video so I'll take your word for it. While it might be a poor example, this sort of thing happens a lot when I can see the pass on telly and Rooney turns around and plays it back to the defender.

In fact, more than a criticism of Rooney, I'm beginning to wonder if that is the specific job that he's asked to do; it probably explains why Herrera who is a more forward thinking player is benched.

3943~~~
You kinda do have a better view though.

3944~~~
Lord save us from people with a video editing package and a penchant for <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urUEeDsCRnk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Big Massive Arrows</a>.

It's all just so simple when you can watch the play over and over again, in isolation, and in slow motion, isn't it?

3945~~~
Januzaj and Di Maria are both wingers, so by definition they are required to take more risks than Rooney who was pretty much playing as the 3rd CB against Burnley for most of the game.

Also, his recent move to an even deeper role has coincided with the negative passing. Watch the Hull, Liverpool, Villa, Newcastle etc. games and his passing is anything but negative.

3946~~~
Well hats off to him for not complaining about his new manager totally ruining him and his goal scoring chances playing him completely out of position for two out of form strikers, he is doing a good job supporting his new manager and doing what he's told to even though it must be extremely annoying for him game after game.

3947~~~
It's a sad day when Roy fecking Hodgson is better at managing one of Manchester United and England's best players rather than the actual Manchester United manager.

I think this is the first time in a long long time the England team might be better than the United one.

3948~~~
Same as he did under Moyes as well. 

He's an awesome player to have, I hope he retires here after becoming our top scorer - he deserves it.

3949~~~
I've already admitted that this may or may not be the ideal example and it was something I found on Facebook. But anyway, I do think Wayne Rooney is conservative with his passing and that's my view. That's an observation, not a criticism and there are several instances over the last two games when I really thought there was a pass on and Rooney chose to turn back.

There is nothing wrong with what Rooney is doing, its just a style of football. If you want expansive football, then those passes should be going into strikers even if there is a chance of offside.

3950~~~
Not sure if you're being sarcastic, can't tell.

What I really meant is...it seems like a pass is on but Rooney opts for safety. He's not a central midfield and when you're just doing a job, its fine to play well within yourself.

3951~~~
Jesus fecking Christ. Another reason the game is slowly turning into a circus

3952~~~
Any old excuse to post these:

He's definitely got the sublime defense splitting ball in his locker. Maybe not to the extent of the absolute best midfielders, but he can do it. It just seems that at the moment he's under instruction to play like Daley Blind.

3953~~~
The tweet on the page before my post, where LvG says if he takes Rooney out of midfield it loses balance, to me that says he pretty much sees Rooney as our best CM as he could have paired Fellaini and Herrera many times and played Rooney up top, but he hasn't.

3954~~~
They come off about one in twenty. And hopefully those aren't his intructioms because he's never going to do it as well as Daley Blind.

3955~~~
Gets an awful lot of assists for a man who apparently can't spot a killer ball though, doesn't he?











And so on.

Must just be luck. Ten years solid of it.

3956~~~
if only I had said he can't spot it.

His passing is inconsistent. But his vision has always been good despite issues execution. None of that is an issue when he plays as a striker like he should. It does when he plays as a midfielder taking heavy touches and over hitting passes left right and centre. Keep him forward where he can impact the game with an assist or a goal, rather than be the creative hub.

3957~~~
Be that as it may, it's still good enough to put him among the top assistors in the league, when he isn't being asked to play like Daley Blind to help the balance of the team.

3958~~~
First off, I agree with the bit in bold completely. 

I used that example to illustrate how conservative Rooney is playing in midfield. I'll admit, based on what other posters have said, its a poor example but the point remains that in general play his passing has lacked ambition, its mostly safety first. That's not to say, he lacks vision or is incapable of playing 'defense-splitting' passes; the fact that I'm calling it conservative means that I acknowledge Rooney has the ability to open up a team from midfield as well.

3959~~~
But, but...80 of those are probably from set pieces.

3960~~~
And we're playing him as a DM to accommodate two completely out of form number 9s...what the feck's goin' on behind closed doors for this nonsense to be tolerated?

3961~~~
Yeah, I mean people rave about his pass  for the Van Persie volley in the title winning game against Villa. But they've just fallen for the English media's hype. Anyone who knows anything about football will tell you that it was Kagawa's 3 yard sideways pass to Rooney that *really* made the play.

3962~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3963~~~
i was new to this message board a year or so ago, and when i was reading a steady stream of that sort of thing about kagawa i honestly questioned if i really knew anything about football at all.

3964~~~
This is why all these formations with him as a #9 are not going to happen, hopefully though we will see him return to the front 4 once we get in CM's that LvG rates.

Maybe LvG has asked Rooney to do this until he can get the midfield sorted in the summer and Rooney, as Captain, has chosen to put the team before himself as he has in the past.

3965~~~
Must be incredibly frustrating tearing in on Charlton's record and basically having his goal threat colossally reduced for the foreseeable future.

3966~~~
Personally I would rather have Bobby as our record scorer than Rooney.

3967~~~
Louis van Gaal says he plays there because he offers more balance in the 8 role, his competitors are Fellaini and Herrera, Louis van Gaal probably feels he is a little more suited to what he wants than Herrera and feels Fellaini's best work is in the final third (a sort of super sub for now anyway).

I can see his point, when a player is not played (in this case Herrera) the caf tends to be of the opinion that player will be our saviour. In the diamond at least the 8 role is important in terms of helping Blind out, the 10 might be too far forward to come back immediately once we lose possession, perhaps Louis needs somebody not so optimistic as Herrera and to be honest defensively I can't have complaints since Rooney has been there.

I think if the manager is still in a job come this summer then he will buy a proper 8 or two and play Rooney as a striker.

I also would like to see classic 442 if he wants to play Rooney in the middle because he loves the ball to the flanks therefore having Young / Januzaj and Angel di Maria in addition to overlapping full backs will get more out of him.

That said if we go classic 442 then Herrera might as well be the 8 because Januzaj and Di Maria will be wide midfielders who will come back to defend and also unlike the diamond the full backs do not need to go so high up the pitch so soon therefore the 8 doesn't need to be as positionally disciplined.

3968~~~
Nice sentiment, but the team is suffering along with Rooney during this bizarre behaviour from Van Gaal. It's not as if Rooney's a good midfielder who wants to play as a striker - he's a very good striker who's being wasted in midfield at the expense of proper midfielders...

3969~~~
Why? Wouldn't you rather watch history being made in your own lifetime than simply paying lip service to a time that you (probably) didn't even experience?

Rooney's been a great player for us and proven during the Moyes and Van Gaal stints that he's far from the spoilt brat Fergie tried to paint him as.

He's shown far more loyalty during times of genuine crisis than many players who are regarded as greats - like Ronaldo, for example, who fecked off after the classless flirting with Real Madrid. Or Keane, who's bitterness and public disrespect of the club is ever-present.

Rooney's shown his true colours during this rough patch and I'd love to see him make history and become our greatest ever goal scorer.

The team should be built around him imo, and instead he's playing out of position so that lesser players who've been with the club for a fraction of the time he's been here can enjoy starts in his position.

3970~~~
Well that's an opinion, but clearly LvG doesn't see anything in Fellaini or Herrera to trust them in CM and prefers Rooney there, whether he's wrong or not will be evident in time.

3971~~~
Or maybe he realised he isn't getting similar money elsewhere and he won't get another club that'll put up with his antics and suck his cock when he needs it like we did last year.

3972~~~
Which is odd because when Falcao and Rooney were both injured Fellaini played in CM against Chelsea and shepherded Fabregas out of the game for 90 mins - arguably our greatest midfield performance (given the opposition) this season.

We looked a balanced side in that game with Fellaini in CM and RvP leading the line and I find very difficult to believe that Van Gaal can't recall this.

I wouldn't say that it's 'an opinion' that playing Rooney in midfield and two out of form number 9s up top is hurting the whole team - I'd say it's pretty much a given.

3973~~~
Didn't Chelsea make a bid for Rooney the summer that Moyes took over?

Rooney could go to a lot of top sides and walk into the team as a 2nd striker. We're lucky to have him.

3974~~~
Louis van Gaal said after the game against Burnley that Rooney gives our midfield more balance. That's his opinion, not mine, it's his reasoning.

You do realise most of our premier league opposition aren't Chelsea? Fellaini will perform a specialist role however Louis van Gaal prefers Rooney's distribution in most games and also he prefers Rooney to Fellaini in the diamond.

3975~~~
Absolute fact. Crazy to me how many people on here don't realise how lucky we are.

3976~~~
That was one game though, Fellaini had other games afterwards that were more clunky and less fluid, my guess is out of him and Rooney, LvG prefers Rooney's mobility and engine. 

I meant it was an opinion that the other options in midfield would be better, they might well be and I think RvP and Falcao are absolutely woeful up top, but I can see where LvG feels more secure with Rooney workhorsing in midfield than with the other two options. The thing I don't get is why he doesn't play Mata up top with one of the strikers, he's no slower than either and could feed the 9 in, where as RvP and Falcao are just in each others way.

3977~~~
He also likes Rooney's long passing, his ability to switch play.

And on your point regarding Mata, if he were to drop Falcao and I think Falcao has given him enough reason to do so, then Mata should just play as a 10 with Young / Januzaj and Angel on the flanks.

3978~~~
Mata as a false 9? Personally I'd rather give Wilson a shot with Mata as the #10 behind him.

3979~~~
We need to squeeze every point we can in this race for top four, he is probably better off getting his run next season, as for now RVP might perform better as the lone striker and should be given a game or two in that role first. If he fails then Rooney.

RVP can still raise his game for the big matches, his experience will be vital during that mad run which is coming up after the next three games, he has it in him to be a match winner and also he should be able to bring others into play. I'm not sure giving Wilson his run when we have the likes of Spurs, Chelsea, Liverpool, City etc. around the corner is the best timing.

3980~~~

3981~~~
MEN - don't they literally make stuff up?

3982~~~
Bit of a rubbish article. Essentially reads like it was written by one of the posters on here.

3983~~~
Yep.

3984~~~
Makes sense though. He's never fit with any of his striking partners, always looked better up top on his own in 09/10. RVP and Falcao are done and Wilson isn't fully ready yet.

3985~~~
?

I've always thought that one of Rooney's best qualities has been his ability to link up well with anyone you throw him with. Hernandez, Welbeck, Tevez, Ronaldo, even Van Nistelrooy on certain occassion and most particularly Saga, have all struck up a decent partnership with him on the field.

3986~~~
So initially he didn't rate Rooney as striker and now he thinks he's our best striker?

3987~~~
Honestly fed up of his bullshit.

3988~~~
From reading some of the quotes coming from Van Gaal, it seems that once we get an all rounded box to box midfielder, Rooney may get played up top.

3989~~~
I'm sure he'll find some ridiculous reason why he can't put him up front. Probably play him at left back or something and claim he needs to be there.

3990~~~
Well I'm comforted by the knowledge that the manager hasn't cracked.

3991~~~
Ye. Balance and all that.

3992~~~
So Louis van Gaal said "Rooney is maybe the best striker" when asked if he isn't good enough for that position but explained he needs his qualities in midfield which shows how highly he rates Rooney and hints once he gets an 8 that can offer what he wants then Rooney will be moved up top.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31477919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31477919</a>

3993~~~
Yeah he's all over the place. In some ways LVG can seem very honest and straight talking but then at other times it seems like he's most interested in portraying his own decisions in the best possible light, rather than admitting he made a mistake.

3994~~~
I missed few last pages, so sorry if anybody else already asked this, but why Rooney isn't putting transfer request? The last time he played 2 games in central midfield two years ago his agent and PR guys from media went on blabbing on how he is unhappy to play there, how he wants to play as a striker, so that was the reason hehe wanted out of the club. So, why isn't he expressing himself as unhappy, and why he isn't asking for transfer request this time?

3995~~~
More than likely it wasn't the real reason back then, which was obvious since he hardly played in midfield back then.

3996~~~
I do think he offers more to our midfield than some of the midfielders we have available.  But at the same time, he's offers more than our strikers are right now.

However, he's an absolute engine in midfield and it's just a precaution playing him there at the moment.  In due time he'll be back up front.  I f@&£ing love the guy though, the things he does for us...

3997~~~
I don't see what everyone is complaining about. 

He thinks Rooney is our best striker, I don't think anyone can argue with that, but he also feels he offers something in midfield that is much needed and that no other player he has availiable currently offers.

3998~~~
That is what people are complaining about, because maybe they disagree.

3999~~~
Because that thing he thinks Rooney offers in midfield that no one else can, is simply a figment of his imagination. We all know as fans that Rooney in midfield just isn't working at all.

4000~~~
I don't particularly like him there myself but, especially without Carrick, we don't have anyone with his range of passing which is also combined with physical power, solid defensive contribution and pace on the counter. 

As I said in another thread, Herrera (who I think is obviously superior) offers very different things to Rooney. His short passing game is superior, as is his eye for a through ball but he doesn't switch the play quickly like Rooney does and he struggles to win the physical battle. 

There's no denying they are different players and it's those differences that Van Gaal currently looks to employ.

4001~~~
Herrera doesn't switch the play as much yes (no one does tbh), but he has the range of pass to do that. Its about instructions in that sense, if thats what the managers wants him to do, then he should just tell him that, thats the managers job.
With regards to physicality yes, thats about the only reason I can see, but Herrera actually wins the ball back or turns over the ball and starts attacks very well his tenacity in the midfield is also very good. If he dropped one of his donkey strikers and put and extra mad in midfield (like Felliani), it would actually also help with the physical battle. Issue is he is clearly looking for the solution that doesn't involve dropping one the the strikers.

4002~~~
The way Rooney won the penalty against Preston went a long way to showing what we miss when he doesn't play up front. Besides Wilson, none of our strikers has the acceleration to get around a defender and force a goalie to commit themselves in a way that draws a foul. Throughout the first half he was making the right runs off the back of the Preston defence, showing he's lost none of his striking instinct playing in midfield. In retrospect, with the way Rooney was running across Preston and beating their offside trap he was always going to get in eventually. Van Persie and Falcao have had months to prove themselves up top, both have failed. Now its Rooney's turn. Rooney must start at centre forward at Swansea.

4003~~~
He had a much better second half than first and I was glad to see him back on the scoresheet.  He just doesn't look as quick as last season, though, which is what I've feared in his return to striker.

4004~~~
Movement was good for the most part but other than that was fairly average throughout. Couple of good cases of link up play but evened out by a few sloppy passes.

Was beginning to get frustrated with himself late on as well so glad he got the goal. You could tell that the "No goals in 2015" stat might have been weighing on him even if he's mostly played in midfield.

4005~~~
He still looks quick, I think he is just out of sorts with link up considering he has not played striker all year really.  He had great movement and showed quickness to get behind the last line of defense it just seemed his runs were off or the midfield didnt know what to do.. He was able to get behind the last line twice, maybe three times but wither he was out of position or the midfield didnt recognize the runs.  His build up the the "penalty" showed he can still dribble passed defenders but he doesn't do it consistently enough to make him look quick. His last real dribble reminded me of the year after Ronaldo left minus dribbling past the goalie and scoring.

4006~~~
Just play him striker. That last bit of play to earn the penalty was good and showed he's not slow. Falcao or RVP wouldn't be able to do that.

4007~~~
Decent performance but we're going to need a better striker in the coming seasons. Hopefully Wilson can be exactly that.

4008~~~
Thought he did really well. Won a pen and got us a goal by being off-side, both of which entail a player being in the box bothering the defenders and pulling them out of position – situations we have seen far too little of this season for my liking!

4009~~~
He needs to play upfront or not at all

4010~~~
I like how Di Maria and him seem to understand each other quite well. Towards the beginning of the season, I seem to recall we saw the beginning of this partnership, but since then they've been positioned in a way where they can't really link up. Last night, I thought Di Maria spotted Rooney's movement really well and I think if they got to develop this a bit more, it could be quite lethal.

4011~~~
That link up was a real highlight of the game for me, we acutally began to look dangerous, albeit against a League 1 team.

Needs to play up front from now on, it's just a real shame that we are missing Carrick.

4012~~~
Yeah, the two best passes of the night were Di Maria to Rooney (first half, threaded through ball down the left channel) and Rooney to Di Maria (second hand, lofted ball down the right channel which the keeper raced out to clear)  They're clearly on each others wavelength and should both spend as much time in the final third together as possible (Di Maria wide and Rooney central) Especially with creativity being an issue for us.

4013~~~
Wasn't exactly the same, but reminded me of the one against Yeovil, I think it was. The keeper read it well though, shame.

4014~~~
Di Maria's passing would work better if we had a player with proper pace running on to them. Something all of our strikers lack.

4015~~~
Except Rooney. Although entirely predictable that you can't see this.

4016~~~
I thought he had a good game, one of the better players. He's a bit more involved in the general play than Van Persie and Falcao, even when playing up front and I think that helps.

4017~~~
Although predictable that your favourites shall never be criticized for anything ever. Rooney was average until he dived to win a pen. Remember when you said anyone could play well against QPR in the Rafael thread yet you go overboard because Rooney won a penalty against Preston. Strange

4018~~~
Twas a nice dive.

4019~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> "overboard"

4020~~~
The amount of coverage this 'dive' is getting is ridiculous. Fergie really did a number on some of these ABU idiots.

4021~~~
Yes but he wasn't average due to lack of pace to get onto passes was he.... He was bang average, but he had the pace to get in behind and Di Maria picked him out a few times, if Rooneys touch was better, or Di Maria's passing more consistent would have led to a few goals.

4022~~~
Is it true that Wayne had 0 shots on target last night, except for the penalty?

4023~~~
I clearly remember one that was blocked in first half.

4024~~~
Blocked by the goalkeeper?

I say this because it was the same for RVP last game I think, zero shots on goal except for one penalty. And then there's Falcao who had 0 shots on target against Burnley, and now last night I'm not sure but it wasn't much.

That's three of the biggest name strikers in the world having 0 shots on target from open play in two matches. Quite worrisome, and it has been like this for big chunks of the season, I remember Southampton away when Rooney played as a striker, he also had 0 shots on target. Van Persie scored 2, but from a mistake and a set-piece, not from a proper chance.

4025~~~
It usually has to do with the fact that we start risking more when we bring Fellaini in, while when we play with our regular strikers, we don't even try to create something, but play it safe. Look at Fellaini before the tactical changer, he was horrible, but when we started risking it more, he got better as would any player playing upfront.

4026~~~
his running and movement were light years ahead of Falcao last nite 

pair him with RVP/Wilson please in the next few games

he has the ability to drop deep and work hard when needed anyway - he'll always try and get involved in the game in constrast to RVP and Falcao who have looked isolated and haven't been able to get involved for one reason or another

4027~~~
Thats not the only issue though tbh, Rooney got in a few times yesterday before we started risking it more. Just his poor touch and Di Marias inconsistent passing that let us down.
What helped was that Rooney was making runs in behind, into the chanels and stretching the play, his pace was a threat.
TBH Di Maria is one of the only players who looks for those passes

4028~~~
Yeah, I do agree with this, I am just pointing out that even with RVP and Falcao, but more risk we would create more (Falcao and RVP both had to great chances against West Ham, but it happened after we started risking it more).

4029~~~
Someone from defense actually. Guess that might be the reason why they didn't count it as a shot on goal. Silly statisticians, it was a shot on goal surely.

4030~~~
Its only a shot on target if the goalie has to make a save, or if its cleared off the line me thinks. Getting the shot past the defender is part of getting it on target.

4031~~~
Yeah. Got some grief this morning and I honestly thought (and still think) it was a penalty - even with no contact.

The keeper came out with his feet and made no attempt to pull away from the tackle and got no where near the ball. Surely a dive is more of a term used for a player trying to deceive the referee that the defending player was attempting to make a challenge - in this case the keeper gave the ref very little option.

4032~~~
Look at the hype his <i>dive </i>is getting. Ridiculous. 

I've never really disliked Rooney, even during the two Rooney-leaving sagas. I'll (possibly rightly) get slated for saying this but I understood his potential want to leave on both occasions. But regardless of all that, the more people hate/ridicule/slate him, the more I actually like/respect him. Look how much attention he gets for doing something 90% of players up and down the country do. It really is a joke. 

It irritates me how people love to comment on his mistakes/errors, but the same people stay quiet when he does the good things.

4033~~~
It's because it's Rooney, the Captain of England and Manchester United, it's because they <i>(the media</i>) are struggling to find a stick to beat us with, it's because they know they will get hits to their shitty little links, it's because rival fans will cry conspiracy if everyone doesn't condemn him (<i>see Roy Hodgson</i>) it's because everyone hates us, and in truth, I'm loving the outrage it's causing.

4034~~~
Why do you even bother? We all know he can't praise Rooney for anything. He could score a hat trick and Orton would find a fault in it.

4035~~~
Or maybe because people like yourself and pogue and the usual Rooney fanboy crew can't say a bad thing about him regardless of how he plays, yet a few runs against a league 1 outfit and he's the answer to all of our problems. Looking through the thread his game has been way below par all season and that's when he was playing further up top too. Even the likes of Scholes came out and said as much about Rooney peaking a few years back. He's basically our Gerrard now. Van Persie may not be as good as 2 years back but he is still a better striker than Wayne Rooney. He's been getting pelters all season from yourself and the others that don't need to be named and that's even when he's played well. It works both ways. They both need Falcao out of the way for good, as he's a hinderance to the whole side.

4036~~~
That's a mind-boggling attitude. You reckon he's fit for the MLS? Ready for pasture? Incapable of influencing the big games? A non-essential starter? We all have our favourites but that's a nonsense, buddy.

4037~~~
Rubbish. Having played in his favoured position all season long, with Rooney having spent most of his season in midfield, he has scored 2 more league goals than Rooney (I haven't bothered looking up goals in all competitions). 1 of these, was a penalty. Now, I'm not one of those who thinks Van Persie is finished, but this is just rubbish, to claim that he's better than Rooney. All evidence points to the contrary.

4038~~~
...

4039~~~
When <a class="username" data-user="33806, @Sparky_Hughes" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/33806/">@Sparky_Hughes</a> is giving Rooney props, you <i>know</i> he's on form!

Shame there's still some caftards so blinded by their own bias they can't recognise what's happening on the pitch, right in front of their own eyes.

4040~~~
He was definately in a good run of form earlier this season, not back to his best but he had some very good games and got goals too.

4041~~~
Some good games, like Van Persie. More bad ones though.

4042~~~
Nah, when used up front he was definitely having more good than bad games. If you include his midfield performances, then yes, but considering he's not a midfielder..

4043~~~
Does an excellent starfish to be fair

4044~~~
I think after last night, shoehorning him into midfield for Falcao will be a thing of the past.

4045~~~
The first 4 games of the season he played as a striker I think, and I reckon it's a bit hypocritical of Pogue to say anyone can play well against QPR then use it as a game that Rooney played well in <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He was anything but good in those first 3 games. The QPR game was probably our best game of the season at home. Most comfortable anyway. Rooney's best run of form was after the suspension, well from the Arsenal game till Newcastle. Since then he's really not been good.

4046~~~
The RVP - Rooney partnership hardly set the world alight but right now it's probably the best way forward, with Fellaini as plan B.

4047~~~
Everyone was pretty terrible in those games though so I don't think you can really use it as a barometer. I think from the QPR game onwards up until after boxing day when LvG made him a midfielder, he was mostly very good, certainly up with Blind as possibly our most consistent outfield player (discounting DDG, of course).

4048~~~
I'll never understand why people want to bash one of the best players we have, one we'll definitely look back on as a club legend in time.

4049~~~
Yeah, Rooney (before Van Gaal tried to Schweinsteiger him) was playing great and was our best performer after De Gea and Blind.

On midfield he didn't look good, but that is because he isn't a midfielder.

I wasn't ever his fan and actually wanted us to sold him (when SAF retired) but he has completely proven me wrong with his performances, and this year with his leadership (bar that stupid mistake when he sent himself of). And yesterday he looked better than Falcao (or RVP this season). If he only had a decent first touch...

4050~~~
He was shit in the first 3 games like everyone else to be honest. However, from QPR to the first half against Spurs he was one of our best players. His form dipped after that but I'd partly put that down to Van Gaal moving him even deeper.

Rooney, Di Maria and Young/Januzaj behind RVP is the way forward imo.

4051~~~
He was nothing special yesterday, but I feel he did enough to start as a striker instead of Falcao next game.

He looked very pleased when he scored, I'm happy for him.

4052~~~
RvP/Falcao annoy me when they get the ball and immediately turn backward because they won’t even try to beat the defender. Rooney does it, he’s not as fast as he was before but this makes the defenders step back a little towards their goal, and in effect there is more space between the lines. If you play 2 slow strikers up top every EPL defence will sit high because they can’t hurt them with their speed anyway.

4053~~~
This place has gone to the dogs if I'm the voice of reason!?!

4054~~~
It isn't possible to criticise him while at the same acknowledge that he's one of our best players of all time? He was very poor yesterday and topped it off with a blatant dive. Still we get stupid comments like "Shame there's still some caftards so blinded by their own bias they can't recognise what's happening on the pitch, right in front of their own eyes." Comments like that could easily backfire, or even better, be said about those that defend a club legend clearly in decline. He's a shadow of his former self. But he does look better upfront than in midfield so hopefully we won't see him in midfield again.

4055~~~
It's amazing to see people trying to find fault with Rooney last night, it wasn't a spectacular performance but he gave us endless running, movement in the channels and didn't just pass it back where he got it from every time he got it, that alone was a huge step up from Falcao and RvP.

4056~~~
It never has worked and never will work. We need to play Rooney upfront alone with Mata in behind or beside young Wilson.

4057~~~
As poor as the first hour was, it felt really good having him back up there.

The prospect of wasting him for half a season was insane.

4058~~~

Hilarious actually

4059~~~
You could see Rooney and the 'keeper laughing about it at the end of the game.

Anyway, it was either dive or get absolutely snapped in half.

Think we should put it to bed.

4060~~~
Wazza having a few late night bevies?

4061~~~

4062~~~
I'm pretty sure Stone Cold tweeted back too.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4063~~~
Seems he was responding to Wade Barrett's comments after the Preston dive:



Odds on the FA charging Rooney with threatening behaviour on Twitter? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

4064~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4065~~~
He wasn't anything special against Preston, yet it was still miles better then anything we've seen from Falcao recently. RVP to an extent too.

4066~~~
Ha-ha! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>



So this is Wings, LvG's favourite "English Restaurant"

4067~~~
His first time passes have been pretty tidy. Fellaini and RvP have been too laboured, though.

4068~~~
Just listening to commentators you would think he's had a terrific first half when he's been ok at best. Clearly much better than any of our other strikers though.

4069~~~
Why is RVP always the one that drops deeper? Don't understand the logic in that. It should be Rooney playing between the lines and instead of Fellaini we really need to throw on a winger to stretch the play.

Seriously why is it we have to stick to a diamond formation when it clearly doesn't work?

4070~~~
He's played quite well. Everything's been neat, tidy and first time.

Shame Fellaini has been shite

4071~~~
Link up play has been pretty good, but because he likes to drop off and link up play, we need someone playing attacking midfield who will run in behind when he does so. Fellaini isn't that guy, although I think his hold up play has been pretty good.

4072~~~
Not impressed, offer very little offensive threat. Rvp isnt playing great either but he has offered some offensive threat.

4073~~~
Rooney has lost all his fire. 

Obviously he still has some of his talent. But I think he gets too much sponsorship money, is far too big a name now and too comfortable.

The difference between this Rooney and the 16-22 year old Rooney is astonishing. He simply doesn't look like he cares any more.

4074~~~
He needs 4 or 5 touches before he can play the ball. Still our best striker and should play upfront with someone else behind him like Mata or ADM or Herrera. Just not RvP or Falcao

4075~~~
Very average today. Lots of misplaced passes and bad touches. Couldn't even spot him in the second half.

4076~~~
I thought he played ok given how little he had in regards to movement around him, Rooney at his best was Rooney partnered with Tevez or behind Hernandez IMO.

4077~~~
7% of the forum thought Rooney was our best player today.

4078~~~
it's funny, he was shit but still better than the other two clowns who usually play up front and he was away from midfield which is a good thing. but yeah a standard Rooney performance, little or no impact on the game but plenty of huff and puff.

4079~~~
I don't think it's about caring, it's more about mellowing I believe. 

I agree on the lost fire part, he still works his socks off for the team. He just doesn't have that ruthless edge anymore which we sorely miss, in all our attacking players in fact (bar Di Maria and Young).

4080~~~
He was decent, got the ball to spread it to the wing but other than that nothing much offered.

4081~~~
Considering how much praise he got in the last game, I thought we will see different United with him up front in  bit more competitive game. It obviously didn't happen.

His overall play was decent, but he barely showed any goal threat at all. Average performance.
Van Persie is far from his best partner, and he is far from great as lone striker either, so to make the best out of him he needs pacey striker next to/ahead of him. Which we don't have.

4082~~~
He was okay. Didn't like how the commentators were saying how he never gives away the ball when he did it at least twice in the first half.

4083~~~
He just is not that good, he hasn't been for a few years. A player who's best features were physicality, pace and power and looked like a grown man at 16, it isn't hard to see that he has lost so much of which made him stand out. He developed and peaked early.  Put him in any other PL team and he would be found out, he's in a bubble at United where everything that he does poorly is down to circumstance, f.x. he needs X amount of games before he can play well, he needs this player and that player to be playing alongside him.
He even escapes media criticism for the most part, absolutely clueless punditry today where he was said to be brilliant in the first half and that he did a wonderful job in midfield in the last few games.
He's nowadays an okay player, far from the world class player that we need in that position, especially now that he has the armband that excludes him from being substituted.

4084~~~
Doesnt strike me as an above average player for weeks, his supposed world class talent is nowhere to be seen.

4085~~~
The day when both van Persie and Rooney (and obviously Falcao) have moved on will probably be the day this team can really take new shape.

4086~~~
He only had 3 shots, one on target, one blocked and one off target.

4087~~~
Thought he was poor today. I wouldn't be upset to see him go in the summer in the summer tbh, think Fergie was right about him, he saw the decline coming. Maybe I'm being harsh though.

4088~~~
The commentary are embarrassing when discussing him. Make him out to be much better than he is.

4089~~~
He is a striker and isn't scoring many goals this days.. I have had enough of him, Falcao and Persie.

4090~~~
He's got the same disgruntled look as he did in the latter stages under Fergie, also performing worse then he did under Moyes so make of that what you will.

4091~~~
He's finished. Don't see why people clamour to have him in the side. No danger is he a creative enough player to be #10 and he just isn't much use as a #9 any more. He hasn't played that role consistently for years.

4092~~~
People who say he looks like he doesn't care. I say it's the opposite. He's trying too hard to do everything. . Some things he has never been expected to do, or frankly good enough to do. Play him as striker, take some responsibility off his shoulders. His best form comes in the final third. His work rate and grit comes in handy as an addition but it shouldn't be used as his main purpose.

4093~~~
He suffered because of van Persie today. He needed another striker up front, who'd pull the other defender away from him and give him more room to have an effect. Kept the ball well in the first half.

4094~~~
That's been my thinking for a while…. Fergie was ruthless. If he felt the player didn't have more to offer, he would get rid. However, I think it's Rooney's lack of consistency that's the problem more than anything, and I don't think he's a leader. But what are we going to do? LVG does not have any power at this moment because he hasn't won anything, and top four looking shaky for the time being- imagine the uproar if he left him on the bench.

4095~~~
I couldn't believe my ears the way he was getting praised by the commentators.

4096~~~
Always the excuse. He was rubbish by his own accord today. Rvp has nothing to do with him not being able to control the ball or shoot at goal.

4097~~~
Yeah that was weird. One appeared to have a raging hard-on for him in particular. I thought he was alright though. Our best attacking player. I would like for him to gett a run of games up front. Hopefully van Gaal doesn't just move him straight back to midfield but I can see it happening.

4098~~~
meh

4099~~~
He could be definitely in my top three worst players this season for us... he is almost useless, he only argues with refs can't control the ball isn't suited to any position in our team(having better player for every position he plays).. but I would try him at CAM again where he was decent in this system before we sell him

4100~~~
Should have let him go.

Fergie knew.

4101~~~
Didn't do much in front of goal, but to be fair he wasn't supplied anything today. No one created a single chance for him. He did well for Herrera's goal.

Average performance.

4102~~~
Yes, I would love to see Rooney have several goalscoring chances in a match as a striker. I think he would score more than Falcao and RVP combined.

4103~~~
Do we have anyone worse at passing the ball over 5 yards? I've never seen a player give it away so much as him. The amount of attacks he fecks up with his shit passing is a joke.

4104~~~
Well Blind, Herrera, Di Maria and Falcao have all been guilty of sloppy passes this season, both short and long, but shhh, we're not aloud to mention them.

4105~~~
Has he forgotten how to be a deadly forward player? Today he looked clueless in the final 3rd, like he has no bite left.

4106~~~
The commentators were literally wanking him off. Do they even watch the game when they come up with some of their crap about him?

4107~~~
Fergie always knows <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4108~~~
These

4109~~~
This really is it. Fergie knew this about Rooney. The problem with Rooney is that he's a Jack of all trades master of none, and with his status being as it is in English football managers are pressured to play him...somewhere.

4110~~~
Agree about RVP and Falcao but Rooney is more useful than either of them and should be kept.

4111~~~
Everyone's mentioned that to be fair.

4112~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Its a depressing Sunday.

4113~~~
Did anyone else think it was a carbon copy of what Falcao has been doing this season?

Back to goal, dropping deep, holding up and laying off before running away from the ball.

4114~~~
Poor Wayne. Peaked early, run his socks off for the club for years, managed to get goals galore. The moment he started to decline, in came Louis van Gaal and tried to convert him into a midfielder. That did not work out, so he is back to playing as a second striker, however due to limited first touch and ball control abilities, he slows down our play in the final third. Would still have him over Robin or Radamel.

4115~~~
I have no idea why either him or RVP are getting so much stick for yesterday. Rooney did alright. Made a few good runs that weren't picked out but on the whole had no service to work with. He actually kept it fairly quick yesterday, opposite of slowing it down. Rarely took more than a touch before he trued to pick someone out.

4116~~~
I heard that comment too. Laughable. If he found a teammate with passes twice in the first half hour I would be surprised. He lost the ball almost every time he touched it. He got better later in the first half and in the second until the hoof ball started. Still nothing special though. RVP looked much more likely to score.

4117~~~
Baffling comments in this thread.

4118~~~
Baffling comments on most threads these days.

4119~~~
The latter two have been taking pelters recently for their poor form. It's not as if Rooney is being exclusively targeted or anything.

4120~~~
He hasn't scored from open play since that Newcastle game, where he actually played better in CM than he did in the last two games playing as a striker. It's been so long that I think it's inevitable he will score next match. Doesn't even matter what position he plays.

But then again I also thought he was going to score a brace against Burnley, when in the end it turned out to be Smalling who got the two goals.

4121~~~
So suddenly 'we should have sold him' posters are back in force?

4122~~~
Didn't look 'past it' when he was on one of them scoring streaks and was our best player until Van Gaal permanently played him as a defensive midfielder. Play Van Persie or Falcao for two months as a holding midfielder and then see how they play up front straight away. Still think Rooney would be best in the number 10 role though.

4123~~~
Our best player... Maybe that's why we aren't that good.

4124~~~
Are they never not in force? Someone is always good for a 300k, granny shagger or doesn't want to play CM comment.

4125~~~
He didn't play 2 months as a holding midfielder either. That was about a game and a half. If he's our best player why hasn't he had a good game in 2015? His best game of the season was newcastle on Boxing Day and he played midfield that day. Best player though. Really shouldn't have given him the new contract. Like I said in the other thread we will witness his decline each passing game over the next 4 years. He is 30 this year, and people say Falcao and RVP are too old yet there's like 2 and a half years between the 3 of them, and 2 of them won't be here come 2016. Watching other top sides you see forwards with different qualities and right now our 3 lack pretty much all of them. You're screwed when your "best" player can't even play 5 yard passes consistently and has one shot on goal in about 900 minutes of football.

4126~~~
Rooney may have been made our main player since Ronaldo left but he has rarely been our best player. He can be a good contributor in a great team but he is not going to lead us to glory. We have won two prem titles since Ronaldo left, '10-11 and '12-13, in neither year was Rooney the main reason why we won. In the former season Nani, vidic and even Berbatov were more influential, in the latter, hands down RVP was the main reason.

4127~~~
It's just his second game playing further forward recently isn't it? It's not like he's been disastrous or anything in both these games. Granted, he was just decent and obviously more is required of him.

Tbh even I have niggling suspicions whether he could replicate his earlier form up front but hopefully he proves me wrong. Trust me, we need him firing with Falcao and RVP mucking about and esp with our chances of making top 4 heavily hinging on him.

4128~~~
Rooney's touch and hold up doesn't really warrant him a striker role. He is best as a support striker who drops deep to pick up the ball and help the midfield.

4129~~~
He was our best player in 09/10 and 11/12. In the former season, he was absolutely integral to the team and hands down our best player. I'd even argue that he was more vital to the team than Ronaldo in 07/08. When Rooney got injured everything went to shit. We lost that title decider against Chelsea without him and lost the CL quarter finals against Bayern with an unfit Rooney being hurried back for the second leg (exacerbated his injury if I remember correctly). I have no doubts in my mind that we'd have won the league and made the CL final if Rooney was fit and firing for the business end of the season. Berbatov was extremely underwhelming during that season and when Rooney was injured iirc. Rooney was on course to match/beat Ronaldo's 42 goal mark before his injury as well.

I wouldn't say it's his fault that we threw away the league in 11/12 when he was fantastic and brilliant once again.

IIRC Rooney was pretty good in the second half of the 10/11 season as well. If anything Berbatov's contributions tend to be overplayed. He scored 5 goals against Blackburn and 3 goals against Pool (a great achievement and loved that overhead kick myself), almost half of his entire goal tally in 2 matches. Not trying to downplay his performances but he was never influential throughout that season and 'led' us to the title. In fact he didn't even feature in the CL final.

If you want to beat Rooney, use a different stick but don't try to wrongly belittle his previous contributions.

4130~~~
You jumped the shark in the bolded part.  No one who knows anything about football would make that argument.

4131~~~
I'm not sure I agree that Rooney in 2009/10 was more important to the team than Ronaldo in 2007/08 but it's hardly an outrageous claim. In 2007/08, we had a variety of goal-scorers, the best defence in the world and a very strong squad. Clearly, Ronaldo was our main man and we wouldn't have been nearly as successful without him, but we still had a great team. 

On the other hand, in 2009/10 we were a far weaker team. We truly relied on Rooney to make things happen for us and - as pointed out above - when he got injured, everything fell apart. 

Without Rooney, the 2009/10 team showed that they couldn't cope in his absence. Look no further than the 0-0 draw away to Blackburn - a match which could have potentially swung the title race our way - as proof of that. In contrast, the 2007/08 team without Ronaldo would probably still have challenged for the title. As I said, it's a difficult comparison to make, but it's not crazy.

4132~~~
It is a controversial point and I can see how you can struggle to understand the point I was trying to make, by just taking that statement at face value. 

Did Rooney have a better season than Ronaldo or was better than him? Absolutely not. The 07/08 team was an excellent team with an excellent supporting cast for Ronaldo in Rooney, Tevez, Scholes, Giggs, Carrick etc. We did rely on Ronaldo for match winning performances but not to the same extent as Rooney on 09/10. If memory serves me right, we were ridiculously dependent on Rooney to drag us through that season with many players not being great overall. Valencia was good that season but I'm struggling to think of many more. Nani in the second half of the season I think? Most certainly not Berbatov or Owen...

Put it this way, I would have been much more at ease going into a match in 07/08 with Ronaldo injured than Rooney in 09/10. Just look at the business end of the 09/10 season when Rooney was injured and you might begin to comprehend the point that I was trying to make. That's all not to say Ronaldo wasn't integral to the 07/08 season, he obviously was. However, I don't think it is ludicrous to claim that Rooney was more important to the team in 09/10 than Ronaldo in 07/08.

4133~~~
Once again, average at best for at least 10 matches in a row, doesnt deserve to start every match for me. Does he have a little bit class in him? And why does he have to complain/shout to the ref everytime he whistles, so pointless.

4134~~~
Captain,Leader,Legend.

4135~~~
Well done Rooney!

4136~~~
Another penalty. Overtaken RVP in penalties this season.

4137~~~
10+ Goals in 11 straight seasons

4138~~~
Things Rooney is better at than Messi:
- Penalties
- Heading the ball into open goals

4139~~~
Poor today. No doubt about it. Falcao offered much more movement. Scored a penalty and a rebound header. Ignore the headlines tomorrow.

4140~~~
He is a forward, end of.

4141~~~
Falcao was terrible in the first half, the only good thing he did was conceding a penalty, Rooney had an average performance and scored 2 goals, RVP and Falcao can't even score on their best days

4142~~~
Now Louis me aul' flower, there's your 20+ goals a season striker, two in one game today. You didn't know it but you had him all along.

4143~~~
Our only capable striker... Hopefully he actually starts up there on his own from now on.

4144~~~
This.

4145~~~
Good to see him scoring again, keep him playing striker and more will come.

4146~~~
Two goals, but a very average performance, at best. Good to see him scoring though.

4147~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Your agenda is ridiculous.

4148~~~
What, he played as bad as Falcao yet a couple of goals will mask that again. Ultimate stats player.

4149~~~
May 10 more come this season!




Falcao was way worse.

4150~~~
Penalty and rebound other than that not special. But it can also be that he'll go on a decent scoring run from now on, lets hope that.

4151~~~
Agree, thought he was particularly poor first half and he picked up in the second slightly but not great. Happy that he got a couple of goals.

4152~~~
Well we need strikers who score goals. Rooney scores goals. Let's keep at it with him up front.

4153~~~
Don't know why everyone dismisses the penalty, it was 0-0 he's not exactly flowing with goals and he dispatches it brilliantly, a lot of other players would have bottled that. He should be playing upfront from now on, he brings goals and movement, I don't know what game some idiots on here were watching he was constantly making runs and creating space in there and with a bit more composure with the crossing we could have had another few from that. It seems some on here do have agenda's when it comes to certain players I think we were good today alot better than we've been in terms of style of play, it probably took the bit of stick from the crowd earloy on to get us going but the width in our game made us create panic in their box, like I said before just need to improve that final ball.

4154~~~
Much needed confidence.

4155~~~
Thought he did well today even without the goals. Some dodgy passing here and there but generally a solid performance.

4156~~~
Play him up top or nearer to the goal and he'll score. That simple.

4157~~~
I couldn't give a feck how, but Wayne scores goals, even he plays average at best. Play him on his own upfront and we will be better off at the end of the season.

4158~~~
Yep.

4159~~~
I have come to terms ages ago with his all round game not being as good as it used to be. But at least you can't argue with his stats. Plus he is just not a midfielder, full stop. 
You can also not expect him to perform wonders when most of our other players seem to be clueless and our manager plays him in every thinkable position bar defence and gk.

4160~~~
I am no fan of Rooney. His overall play today was unimpressive but goals win matches and that is what we sorely need. As poorly creative as our midfielders are we need someone who can still manage to put the ball in the net. He is not as skillful as RVP or Falcao but he does seem to find the net so he deserves to be the main striker at the moment. The Valencia cross to a delayed Rooney entrance into the box has in the past yielded some goals.

4161~~~
His second goal is what we've been missing all season. His movement is excellent and you can bet he'll be in the right place at the right time more often than not. The further up the field he plays the better he will be.

4162~~~
That sums up Wayne Rooney today and for the last few years. I think his all round game is nothing special but he pretty much guarantees a decent goal return when he plays up front. Hope the midfield experiment is over. We need his goals up front.

4163~~~
He puts them away. Well done Wayne.

4164~~~
10 league goals despite playing most of the season either in CM or stuck behind our two static strikers. Play him up top and he'll guarantee you goals. Did well to stay on and be in the right position at the right time for the second goal. Also a read a stat that he becomes the first player to score 10+ goals for 11 seasons in a row? Not bad for a mediocre striker!

4165~~~
Not a particularly good performance overall but did the job in two key situations which is what you need from your big players.

4166~~~
Good performance from him today I feel. Not only because of the two goals but also because he always offered a passing option for our midfield.

4167~~~
I'm usually bricking it when I see Rooney stepping up to take a penalty, but the last couple of pens have been well taken by him.

4168~~~
I thought Rooney had a good game as he looked lively with the ball. He actually got by defenders a few times with nice moves while receiving the ball.

4169~~~
Les be honest, the best thing he does now is put the ball in the net. Its the only 'world class' attribute he has left.

Madness to be wasting him in midfield.

4170~~~
Play him as a striker or don't play him at all. He is by far our best striker and there he actually looks a class player. I hope Van Gaal plays him there all the time.

Our best player after De Gea this season? I think that it is between him and Blind for our second and third best player (based only on performance).

4171~~~
The only player in the history of EPL to have ever done so.

He'll go as a legend of both United and Premier League.

4172~~~
England?

4173~~~
Dunno. He didn't deliver when it matters since 2004, but he'll probably be the all time goalscorer.

4174~~~
No player in his generation delivered to be fair, England haven't gone past the quarterfinal stage of any competition(major) since 1996. If he becomes the all time goalscorer for his country, i see no reason why he shouldn't be considered a legend.

4175~~~
I would not agree to this blindly... however... <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

When you consider we have Mata on the bench it makes no sense not to push Rooney up the field and sit Falcao.  Think about Rooney, Mata, Herrera, Blind all moving off the ball and making supporting runs... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>!!

Now add some width to give them more space and you can really see a dangerous team and one I think could compete against the top two.  We are never beating Chelsea and/or City playing Falcao or RvP the way they have been playing.

4176~~~
He wasn't that good, but he delivered. Delighted for him, we need players that can deliver when things don't go our way. 

He was much better after Falcao went off and he was moved in front.

4177~~~
He needs to stay up top from now on.

He doesn't have the creativity or vision of a #10, but he doesn't have the sharpness, movement, ball control, and speed of thought that he had as a proper #9 in the 2009/10 season. Ever since the 2009/10 season, Rooney has struggled when playing up front on his own, and he's only world class when he has a strike partner to play off of. If he plays as a deep-lying forward a la Muller under van Gaal at Bayern, then we can see the best of Rooney. However, he won't be effective enough in anything else.

Rooney's quite a paradoxical player. On one hand, he's very versatile and can bring in 6/10 performances from almost anywhere. However, he's at his best only at the very specific free-roaming central forward role with a strike partner. At this rate, I cannot see Rooney playing up front as he's lost the traits of a proper #9 after the injury against van Gaal's Bayern, and he cannot play as a proper #10 like he did today as it exposes his lack of creativity and vision.

Rooney's role model is Litmanen, and I only wish he can play now like Litmanen did for Ajax.

4179~~~
Play him a bit further forward and he scores twice, who would have thought?

4180~~~
Every game he looks reasonably mobile and turns well enough I am happy. Stick him at the 9 and he'll be fighting with Aguero, Sturridge and Costa for whatever the feck we call the Pichichi for the next few seasons.

4181~~~
He wouldn't have scored the penalty if he was played in midfield?<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

But yes he should be played up top or not playing at all. His good movement as a forward, his finishing and frankly any lack of finesse to his play don't allow him to play a position other than a striker. He has some worrying weaknesses to his game and is prone to being absolutely woeful and because of that he shouldn't be undropable for the sake of the team. For the time being he should be battling Falcao and RvP for one position and based on performances up top he should be starting as a striker now.

4182~~~
He should be a striker or not playing. It really is that simple.

4183~~~
He's a strange one. Doesn't do anything overly impressive but then ends up with two goals and has to be considered for MOTM. Anyway, he's a goalscorer - that is something that cannot be disputed. Should be played as a striker from now on.

4184~~~
Still not looking comfortable, like most of our players, but he's effective and that pretty much sums up our performances this season. Keep him high up the field because he guarantees goals, something none of our strikers can do.

4185~~~
I've never seen another striker that can consistently score a brace while being average to below average for the rest of the match.  Wayne up front isn't pretty these days, but like you say he usually puts the ball in the net.  That cannot be said for our other two big name strikers this season.

4186~~~
He's due for a testimonial at the end of the season and hope we play against Madrid.

4187~~~
Any gif of that penalty? That was as perfectly taken penalty

4188~~~
Nothing special but got the job done, what we've been lacking for most of the season from our forwards.

4189~~~
He's such a polarising figure at the moment for me.

On the one hand his donkey like first touch and lack of finesse is a major part of the reason we look so slow and devoid of ideas in the final third. We've been ignoring our strikers' runs all season because as soon as Rooney gets the ball its either going sideways or out to Valenica.

On the other hand he scored twice, as he often does, one with as good a penalty as you'll ever see. 

I cant decide if i think his pros outweigh his cons.

4190~~~
How you perceive his performance depends on what his role from lvg was. If he was put in the team to score and finish off moves he had a decent game, anything else and he was wank.

4191~~~
It's simple, the cons are not easy on the eye, they are frustrating, they are repetitive.

His pros simply win us games. The pros win.

4192~~~
Sparky the guy is awesome for continuing to get goals for us. Stick him up top for the rest of the season and our chances on making top 4 increase greatly.

4193~~~
I actually think people overstate this or rather concentrate so much on it they they ignore the times he actually doesn't do this. He's played plenty of excellent passes through the middle this season to our strikers, more than any of our actual AM's bar Di Maria.

And it's become increasingly obvious that he's been under instruction with that pass to Valencia over the last 2 years. Which is fecking stupid given that Valencia is wank.

4194~~~
Two simple goals, a pen and a tap in disguising another poor performance. He is lucky he is competing with RVP/Falcao. Once they leave, he is going to stick out like a sore thumb in the future.

4195~~~
Let's remember he was useless before Falcao won us the penalty. As useless as any of our striking performances this season. Penalty later though and he's the great hope to top 4.

4196~~~
I agree and if that's all he is being asked to do his season will be a success, if he is expected to contribute to our overall play not so much

4197~~~
As if his touch is *that* bad. Nowhere near. Like a guy who's been playing up front and as a No.10 for one of the best sides in the world for over a decade can't trap a football, or instantaneously create a yard of space for himself.

Going by this season alone, he's lost the ball through a poor first touch an average of 1.1 times per game. That compares to Falcao's 2 times per game, Januzaj's 1.5 times per game, Di Maria's 1.4 times per game and Van Persie's 1.3 times per game. And yet certain people will swear that all of those players have a much better touch than Rooney.

And if we go and look at other top players in the league, Sanchez has lost the ball through a poor first touch an average of 2.4 times per game, Ozil 1.8 times per game, Aguero 1.7 times per game, Silva 1.4 times per game, Costa 2.2 times per game, Hazard 1.9 times per game, Sterling 2.5 times per game, Coutinho 1.7 times per game, Kane 1.9 times per game, and so on.

Again, some would have you believe that all of the above players have a first touch that is so superior to Rooney's it isn't even funny.

Now, my point here isn't that Rooney has a better first touch than all of the players above, because he doesn't.

It's that to talk of his 'donkey like first touch' is sheer hyperbole, and an absolute myth that has somehow been allowed to take hold and pass without challenge.

4198~~~
If we play him upfront with either Mata/Wilson as his partner we might actually stand a chance of getting 3 points at newcastle.

Sadly, I don't think this would happen because Falcao was probably taken off early to be saved for midweek.

4199~~~
It's also the most important attribute in all of football.

I don't care if he walks backwards with less pace than Berbatov. If he kicks the ball and it ends up in the net - he's automatically our best choice striker.

4200~~~
Rooney having a rubbish first touch is just some trope that reached critical mass on the Caf and then became public "knowledge"

4201~~~
Absolutely. His ability to score so frequently, even when playing poorly, is his one big selling point. He should play upfront because he almost guarantees goals.

He's just not good enough to play in midfield.

4202~~~
He offers goals on average performances, win-win

4203~~~

4204~~~
I think Rooney is especially better than RVP and Falcao at reading what his teammates are doing and adapting his runs/positioning. Saw it yesterday with the 2nd goal. If RVP doesn't get the ball where and when he wants, he's rarely on hand to clean up for others. Falcao showing similar though I think his problem is more physical - doesn't have the burst to do the holdup job and then run back into the box - and lack of familiarity with our creative players.

4205~~~
Fantastic perseverance for the goal!

4206~~~
Thank you Sir!

4207~~~
That was great pressing for the goal, fair play to him.

4208~~~
Thought he played well all game. Looked sharp, received the ball well, laid it off well, and had a perfectly legitimate goal wrongly disallowed. Then some typical Rooney perseverance helping to create the winning goal.

The one blot on his copy book was missing that dinked chance early on, but he kind of made up for it. And i'm not sure we'd have seen RvP or Falcao pressing that hard in the 88th minute.

4209~~~
Good pressing for the goal. He had a decent enough game overall, and looks better up there football wise than RVP or Falcao do, but he should've buried his earlier sitter.

4210~~~
I was split between Rooney and de Gea for the MOTM vote. Went for Rooney as I feel he contributed to the win throughout the game a little more than de Gea was given the opportunity to.

Great relentless chasing which led to the goal, but I thought he played as well as could be expected up top given the overall performance.

4211~~~
I thought he did everything he could with poor service for the most part again. One of his better performances this season I'd say.

4212~~~
Like RvP and Falcao, he was fairly starved of chances today. However, unlike RvP and Falcao, he chased things down, showed strength and pace even in the dying embers of a game and made something happen.

4213~~~
Worked hard, and was wrongly flagged offside in dangerous positions twice. Created the goal from pressing hard. Good header in the 2nd half from a cross which had now pace on it. Got it low and forced a good save. Kept the ball well and held it up. Good game for him.

4214~~~
Looked sharp. Still room for improvement, but I thought he kept their defence on their toes all night.

4215~~~
Our best number 9. Still prefer him playing behind a decent number 9

4216~~~
Looking more and more like a captain.

4217~~~
We scored cos Rooney went chasing a lost cause deep in the game. That's more than enough for me. Led the line well and was very unlucky not to have scored his header thanks to Krul's heroics. There is no argument for switching his position again right now. Play him up top.

4218~~~
Never give up, never surrender.

4219~~~
Fantastic pressing for the goal.

4220~~~
Great determination for the goal. Scored a legitimate goal as well, shite ref ruled it off. Should have scored in the first half though, probably twice. Clearly our best striker though, by a distance.

4221~~~
Anyone see him running back after Herrera was tackled and Cisse put it wide? Absolutely phenomenal work.

Please someone GIF it <a class="username" data-user="32240, @Olly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/32240/">@Olly</a> ?

4222~~~
He had one laid on a plate for him that he squandered, and another that he should've arguably done better with, but agree that his overall game is much better for us up front than RVP or Falcao.

4223~~~
Yes, good pressing for the goal, but quite average overall.

4224~~~
Loved his performance, tireless work across the front line, good hold-up and link play, drove the channels, had a couple of runs with the ball, made good runs off it, just a joy after months of Jurassic Park 1 & 2 up top. My MOTM.

4225~~~
Should have scored a long time ago but good to see him making runs and once a ball finds his foot or he isn't offside.... I can only dream

4226~~~
He wasn't great but his desire to get to the ball won us that game. That's why I'll always pick him.

4227~~~
He got us out of jail tonight! He should have scored earlier, but can't really criticise when he saves our arses like that.

4228~~~
Very good performance, unlucky with the offside call.

4229~~~
You really do miss seeing him expend his energy in the forward areas. Our goal tonight came about because he hustled Krul into making that mistake. He's our best striker not just in the intelligence of his movement but the pressure he can put on opposition defences.

4230~~~
He did score earlier. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>


As for that huge chance in first half, those 4-5 Newcastle players simultaneously raising their hands calling for offside must have confused him a bit.

4231~~~
Showed a determination today that was befitting of the shirt.

4232~~~
Difficult first half but hats off to him for the spirit and fight he showed to keep that ball alive at the end of a tiring evening where many players would have lost their head along the way. 

I don't praise Wayne Rooney very often but that had every element of the qualities to be a brilliant captain for Manchester United. Well done to him.

4233~~~
Unlike RVP and Falcao he held the ball up well and made things happen also made runs behind the defense, he needs to play upfront every game and not waste him in midfield.

4234~~~
Better than falcao or rvp

4235~~~
Can't help but be really impressed by his work for the goal - that's the Rooney I love in a United shirt.

4236~~~
decent performance from Rooney, didn't receive too many passes in the box but he never gave up.  The lack of creativity is evident and when you see Rooney dropping back to receive the ball it's a definitely a worrying sign

4237~~~
Feckin linesman, that was a very nice goal.

4238~~~
Be careful saying that around here. <a class="username" data-user="19613, @Orton" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19613/">@Orton</a> will accuse you of being bias.

4239~~~
He missed 2 sitters.

4240~~~
I'm pretty sure Ashley Young scored the winner. I'd personally be thanking Tim Krul for that one. Worst goal kick of the season.

4241~~~
Plays like he still believes. 6 Newcastle players around him when he took the shot that set up the goal. Did what was needed to secure the win.

4242~~~
He created the goal with his pressing.

4243~~~
The real kieto Mark 2.

4244~~~
Fair enough, I actually had in mind the 2nd half performance during which we were dreadful in terms of creativity.  Just pissed it around as if we were winning 3-0.

4245~~~
Looked sharp I thought. Still room to improve but still our best striker I think. The goal would not have been scored without him either, his desperation was tremendous. Good game.

4246~~~
sharp is the right word to sum up his performance. I liked him today but should have scored, he worked the only goal of the game though

4247~~~
His finishing and touch let him down today, but he compensated with very high work rate. 90% of the goal is because of him. 

Much better performance than in the Sunderland game.

4248~~~
After so many poor performances up front as a striker for this season and the last, this was much better from Rooney up front. Since the 2009/10 season, I haven't seen Rooney perform this well as a lone forward up front. He was sharp, his movement was great, his energy levels made it tough for Newcastle, and he took up nice positions. He was also not sloppy on the ball like he normally was up front, which allowed us to continue on with our attacks.

After doubting whether Rooney would be good enough to play up front, this performance makes me feel more confident about him up front as the lone striker. Hopefully, this isn't an anomaly. Rooney, at the moment, offers more up front than van Persie and Falcao, and we need more of these sort of performances from Rooney to get some more goals in the future matches.

4249~~~
Did great for the goal. Typical Rooney really. Never give up and thankfully we capitalized. 

Along with that, though, I also felt his general play against today was very neat and tidy. He threatened in behind a few times and was unlucky not to have a goal.

4250~~~
You've got to admire his part in the goal, he never gave up and that's exactly what you want from your captain.

4251~~~
I disagree, I think the biggest reason for the goal was the poor decision from the defender to pass it back to Krul, it wasn't an unforced error due to Rooney's pressure but the defender still had the basic task of clearing the ball and in most cases that's what would have happened.

Rooney was ok today, we are reliant on him to score though, as of now going into the big matches I am concerned we do not have a player that we can rely on to get a goal out of nowhere. I hope Rooney will be that player because somebody needs to go on goal scoring form but I was hoping he'd get a goal today and with the two good chances he had I was disappointed he didn't take them.

In the big matches as a striker he will probably have minimal chances so he really needs to take them.

4252~~~
I don't think he was particularly good today, but he is mobile and making the runs that no one else has been making for us all season.  His threat to break the offside trap will be important in these top 6 fixtures that are coming up.

4253~~~
No secret that we create chances when he plays upfront. His movement and ability to bring others into play in the attacking third is excellent even when he misses his chances like did today.

4254~~~
Our best player by a mile. He created the goal. He would have scored too, if not for non-existent off sides.

4255~~~
Top 4 is on his back and dependant on his form, it's really down to him getting us the results and continuing like this.

4256~~~
We're not gonna get it then going by the historical times when we've relied on him.

He was good today though, just keep RVP and Falcao away from the first XI and we'll do much better.

4257~~~
Apart from the two missed sitters, I thought he played well today. Its understandable as well that he lacks sharpness in front of goal after playing in midfield for a while.

4258~~~
Last time we 'relied' on him, he fecked up by only scoring 34 goals, including what could have been a crucial winner away to Sunderland in the final game of the season. And then by instructing QPRs defense to collapse in the last 180 seconds of their game against City.

All entirely his fault.

(Point being here that, were it not for Rooney, that 2011/12 team wouldn't have even got anywhere near the title)

4259~~~
I'm just saying history isn't on our side when Rooney is the main man. Not his fault.

4260~~~
Agreed. Also, people don't take into consideration that when Wayne Rooney is the main man, he doesn't have a Wayne Rooney to rely on to do the business when it isn't his day. He's been our most important player for years in that respect, even when he wasn't the stand out player at the club.

In terms of yesterday, it was encouraging. His touch was a lot tighter around the box, he committed players, took players on, ran with the ball, ran in behind, all that was missing was a goal. He should have really got it when he tried to dink Krul, but I sympathise with him on the other chance, the pull back was diabolical from Di Maria and went behind him so he'd have done well to adjust.

4261~~~
There's a lot of praise for a striker here who missed 2 huge chances, made good runs, pressed and passed a bit. 6.5/10, maybe 7/10, nothing more.
Just because the rest of our attack was shit does not mean we have to glorify what was average.

4262~~~
Do you not understand that Rooneys pressure is what caused the defender to make a poor decision? Just baffling logic by you.

If rooney stops chasing the defender doesnt make that mistake. Fact. but because he chased it and followed it it lead to the mistake. Because the defender was rushed. I.e Rooney had a significant part in the goal.

4263~~~
He didn't have a great game but his performance highlighted the benefit of having a more mobile centre forward whose pace was a threat, who ran in behind, ran into the channels etc. He should be playing up front every week and falcao should remain on the bench.

4264~~~
7/10 performance is "average"? If only...

4265~~~
What were the 2 chances he missed? One was the Young headed pass. What was the other one? The Di Maria pass to him was behind him so not sure how that counts as a chance.

4266~~~
I also don't think he should be blamed for that chance di Maria "set" him up because it was a shit pass.

I don't doubt he would score it because his finishing is usually good, but Krul went off once the flag went up.

4267~~~
Depends on your agenda really. To a bunch of people on here that Di Maria pass behind him was a "sitter", unsurprisingly.

4268~~~
He showed why he's captain, but he also showed why he isn't a centre forward and should get his chances from midfield/from behind a striker.

4269~~~
His movement demonstrated exactly why he's a centre forward. He missed a nice chance in the first half, but that happens. His finishing is routinely excellent, enough to compensate for the odd miss.

4270~~~
He had a great match, his control was great with his back towards goal(which is normally an issue with him) and he did some neat and tidy stuff when we got him on the ball. Our movement in attack was pathetic though, only he seemed to know where he should be and what he should be doing. Our wingers hugged the line as if they were related to it and didn't take advantage of the space in behind caused by Rooney's hold up. This just tells me the quality of coaching has just been poor. I'd also like to see him take more shots instead of always trying to link up. The hard work stuff is just mandatory if he's playing. 

We need mata on the pitch though, him and rooney would make a good partnership up top. RVP and Falcao just won't be leading us to the top 4 so its time for something new.

4271~~~
I don't see how anyone can a) blame that on Rooney and b) not be at miffed at Di Maria for screwing up a piss easy pass. What made it worse was that he played it - for no apparent reason at all - with the outside of his foot.

4272~~~
So let's review the post that you just commented to:

Now ask yourself that question but this time read the bolded part.

The defender despite Rooney's pressure simply had to clear the ball and it was easy enough, to say Rooney was 90% responsible for the goal is wrong, even if Rooney had pressured defenders like that in most cases the ball would have been cleared.

Newcastle were far more responsible for conceding that goal even though Rooney gave them a decision to make it was still very basic stuff to deal with it so let's not act as though Rooney used voodoo to make the ball move backwards.

I've already credited Rooney for his pressure in my post, I am saying however his pressure was not responsible for 90% of that goal, if you think that then watch him pressure defenders in future and also observe how often the ball is cleared.

If that is our sole chance of scoring a goal against the defences we are too face you know Rooney pressuring the defence then may god help us, for surely we need a miracle, you will however be of the opinion his pressure will cause them to make many errors but actually even when he pressures you'll find them just clear the ball.
It's not a fact, the defender even without pressure could still pass it back, at that point it's an unforced error. Please explain to me how it's a fact? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard, you don't possibly know what would happen for the scenario hasn't happened, I do accept had Rooney not pressured it was more likely the defender would clear the ball but let's not act as though that goal wasn't gifted, Rooney did what any good striker should but in most cases the defender would have just cleared it, we were fortunate.

4273~~~
I thought Rooney's response was admirably restrained. Di Maria's seems to be fast taking on Nani's role as "<i>player most likely to drive his team-mates up the wall with inexplicably bad decisions</i>".

4274~~~
His first touch and passing can be frustrating at times but he did really well to force the mistake that led to the goal.  It's churlish to suggest otherwise.

4275~~~
I thought Rooney was excellent last night. We look far more dangerous with him up there. I still don't think we will get a top 4 spot but we have more chance with Rooney as a forward.

4276~~~
All I know is that had Rooney not chased the ball, the goal would have never happened.

4277~~~
I've been one of those on Rooney's back a lot over the years, but he is slowly but surely turning me back again. I was dead set against him being made captain, but I think he's excellent in the role, and made me eat my words. This clip from last night just sums it up, just watch him bust an absolute gut to try and get back and save the situation

4278~~~
Awesome. Evans did well too in that sequence. As much as he can against 3 Newcastle players.

4279~~~
That's the sort of thing that managers love, yet some of our fans who can't see past an occasional heavy touch refuse to acknowledge.

4280~~~
I don't really understand your point.

It is a fact that if Rooney was not there, the defender would have easily been able to clear or be calm. Yes he may still have back passed it. However Krul wouldn't have had to make a snap pass if rooney wasn't there. He would have had yeons to clear it peacefully. It is directly because rooney pressed them both that the situation panned out like it did. Whether it was 90% involvement in the goal I don't know.

I can't forsee that if Rooney wasn't there that they would or wouldn't make the same mistakes but I can tell you for a fact that it would have been significantly more unlikely. Furthermore just because Rooneys pressure will not always lead to a goal, it doesn't mean he isn't responsible. Every time he does that he creates the opportunity for a mistake. Just because a mistake isn't made every time doesn't therefore mean that when it is made he isn't that responsible for it. 

Anyway, we are debating intricacies of "how much" Rooney was responsible. The fact he was was my main point, anyway. Your initial post seemed to make it sound like it wasn't totally insignificant but largely insignificant which is what I disagreed with.

As for the rest of your post about relying on his pressure to score goals and God help us if so, it has no relevance to what I'm saying. Don't even know where that fit in.

4281~~~
I have already told you to and shown you in my post the credit was given to Rooney for pressing. If this was United who conceded the goal the blame would be on the defender who made the error and not credit to the attacker who pressed. Defenders often are pressed and usually they deal with that pressure from the striker.

And as for the 90% point, why then respond to my post? I responded to a post that said 'His finishing and touch let him down today, but he compensated with very high work rate. 90% of the goal is because of him.' I disagreed Rooney was 90% responsible for the goal…

So now you're just repeating what I said in the very post to which you are responding?


I've already addressed this in previous posts.

And to the very post you are responding to:

Despite crediting Rooney for his pressure numerous times now you still don't seem satisfied...

You must put a post into context, when the post to which I am replying says '90% responsible' and then I say I disagree then it probably means I disagree with the very statement in that post, I did not mention how responsible he was, I made clear his pressure made it a forced error but I still maintained it was an error by the defender.

You assumed I mean't largely insignificant but that's not my problem, I didn't say that, it's yours for assuming. And also the fact I referred to it as a forced error due to Rooney's pressure makes it quite clear I didn't think his role was largely insignificant, I'm not sure how you came to that conclusion.

4282~~~
This debate is utterly pointless, so if it makes you happy, you win.

4283~~~
Nah he doesnt. It was 90% Rooney.

4284~~~
Every debate on here is pointless.

4285~~~
We can pretty much agree there!

4286~~~
A reminder that Rooney has basically been around forever, and is still only 29 (bearing in mind Di Maria isn't really young either):

4287~~~
He is making strong case each game to stay in what is his best position. Long may it continue.

4288~~~
That pass to Di Maria was class<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Better than the goal itself.

4289~~~
Wtf was that chip about though? When did he last score one of them actually? It must be around 7 years.

4290~~~
Great header for the goal.

4291~~~
This is why you play him up top. As Shearer said, 'it's a no brainer'.

4292~~~
Looking very sharp tonight. If we can get him more involved he can win this.

4293~~~
Makes you wonder if we might have had more points if we'd played him up top instead of the Jurassic duo for most of the season......

4294~~~
10/10 performance from him this half. Let's hope he continues that in the second.

4295~~~
Yeah, an in form striker might have papered over a lot of the cracks we've been seeing all season.

4296~~~
One of the positives for us tonight if there are any.

4297~~~
Nice header. Barely involved apart from that. His free kicks need to improve. Always hits the first man or skies a shot.

4298~~~
Reminded me a bit of 09/10 Rooney. The headed goal, the hold up play, the surety of touch. And to think, we've been playing him in midfield for 70% of the season.

4299~~~
Our best player tonight. Keep him as a #9

4300~~~
Some of the comments are over the top since he's been nothing special. Not by his fault mind you, he can't play alongside Fellaini, that's clear as a day, but still, he was average apart the goal.

4301~~~
Touched the ball about 10 times and was fed in twice but still was by far and away our best outfield player. This possession lark is ridiculous if we can't create chances for our strikers.

4302~~~
He was average at best. Can't fault the players up front when it turns out the philosophy is to hoof it up to Fellaini.

4303~~~
Been the story all season for our strikers. Absolutely zero creativity and all about possession.

4304~~~
Yep. Horrible tactics

4305~~~
He was very good in the first half. Did everything you want from your striker.

Barely noticed him in the 2nd half except for when he tried to bail out our divers. Should be giving them diving lessons in training.

4306~~~
Lovely finish, beautiful ball for adm, wrong person to take the free kick near the end, should have been a left footer in that position

4307~~~
I thought he did all he could, our best player behind De Gea.

4308~~~
Did good with the service he got, but there's no one behind him to create chances for him.

4309~~~
If only we played him up top all season! We would be comfortable top 4 team

4310~~~
4 goals in 5 games since he went back to being a striker. Man is a goal machine.

Why would there even be a DVD about him called Goal Machine if he wasn't, eh!? Ahh! Stumped you with that one, haven't I hater?

Joking aside, while I won't say he's been out of this world since his return to the front line, he has looked far more dangerous than RvP and Falcao were looking.

And . . . well, frig it: LvG has to take some blame for not deploying him correctly this season.

He basically said after the QPR home game, in which Rooney started as a forward, scored and got an assist, that Rooney had been 'good', but not 'spectacular', and that others could perform the role better.

Those others being Falcao and RvP, presumably. He then stuck with Falcao and RvP as his front players, while Rooney 'did a job' in midfield. When it became clear the Falcao/RvP combo wasn't working, Fellaini, Mata, Januzaj and Wilson all got a turn playing up front as a #9 or #10.

The only one who didn't is Wayne - at least until very recently, when he's as if by magic started to score goals and look threatening again.

4311~~~
Busted a gut tonight, fair play to Wayne. Still our most important player aside from De Gea.

4312~~~
It is a pity how Van Gaal has treated Rooney this season. Had he played as striker since the start of the season, he will be battling aguero, Kane and costa for the golden boot.

4313~~~
Thought he was our best player (equal with De Gea). Led well as a captain and was generally solid in his game (freekicks aside). Would keep him as the #9 - should have been there all season.

4314~~~
Only good outfield player we had tonight. Acted as a true captain and never stopped. Brilliant header too. 

It was quite funny at the end of it all when you see the moment he realises ADM fecked up with that referee shirt tug.

4315~~~
Same things been said for the other strikers hasn't it yet it was all their fault? Simply the team is broken. Don't see anything changing this season regardless of who is up front. Using Fellaini to partner a striker is horrible to see. We've become the Everton of old without the good set pieces. So disappointing.

We need a striker who offers more and can take players on. We simply don't have one. Rooney is a good finisher but he lacks a lot of qualities now and struggles to influence matches.

4316~~~
He always delivers against Arsenal - Performance,goals,heart etc Its just sad to see him play with these lot as opposed to Vidic,Ronaldo,Rio and the rest

4317~~~
Not really. Rooney in a few games has up top, has been a lot better than Van Persie and Falcao, who had Di Maria, Rooney, Mata and co. there to create. They just didn't move.

4318~~~
They also played as a pair which never worked and was a complete detriment to the team. Just find it funny seeing the same excuses getting churned out again. Rooney goal came from the best cross of the season from any of our players in this same game. Like I say he's a good finisher but his performances since going back up top haven't changed much.

4319~~~
He was probably our best outfield player overall today, definitely looking quite good again up front.

4320~~~
He wasn't that great today, but he scored and also setup a decent chance for Di Maria.
Apart from that though, didn't hold up the ball well enough and gave it away a bit. So so performance

4321~~~
One chance one goal, the type of finishing we have been missing all season, the biggest problem is we hardly create any chances.

4322~~~
When Rooney played as a pair with either Falcao or Van Persie, he was also very good. Games I can think of are QPR, Hull.

4323~~~
Has pretty much everything you could ask for in a centre forward when he's on his game. Frustrating that it's taken us until now to play him there consistently.

4324~~~
There's no middle ground when it comes to Rooney. I'm seeing excuses being used for him already in his games up top. He wasn't good against Sunderland or Swansea recently, the goals obviously make It look better for him. Posts like this though...
Completely overrating him. So he's a complete center forward now? No chance.

4325~~~
Was class today. Shame the rest did feck all in the second half. At least it looks like he'll finally get an extended run up front, hopefully until the end of the season. He's by far our best striker and is our best player when played as a striker.

4326~~~
It's infuriating what we've done to him this season. Playing him in midfield for so long disrupted his momentum but thankfully he's getting it back now. He was one of our brighter performers with the quality of his link play and movement up top. We still lack potency but it was worse without him up there.

4327~~~
What aspects you look for in a centre forward doesn't he have? He may not be the best in all of those areas but he is good in them all at the very least. Fairly fast, excellent finisher, more than capable passer in the final third, can score headers too and has good movement in the box, as well as occasional moments of magic. I suppose he isn't a great dribbler these days so I'd agree with that if you were to point it out.

4328~~~
Has been good of late, and our best outfield player at the moment, along with Young. I'd still upgrade him at any point in the next 15 months should the opportunity arises, as I don't think he's good enough overall, and is a level below the top forwards out there. That he's our best player says as much about us really, he isn't good enough to be the best player at an elite side for my money. The issue is, the next generation coming up are probably not quite there yet either, although you never know one of them could hit the ground running if we brought them in. 

I just think he needs more speed and individual, selfish brilliance about him. Goals out of nothing, having defenders quaking when he's turned and running at them etc. That is the standard that is being set now at this level of the game.

4329~~~
Please...just let him be. Let him stay in his current position for the rest of the season. Don't ask him to fill in at CM anymore, don't push him back when RVP returns. Just let him get his goals and work on his runs, he'll help us

4330~~~
He'd have way more goals for the club if he played up top his whole career, sadly the managers saw it differently. His movement is wonderful with a complete set of finishes.

4331~~~
Rvp and Falcao can distribute coffee and water at the club, Roo should up front. He looks like he's still got something in him, if we have to build a team around someone, its him.

4332~~~
Fast but not with the ball, his dribbling is lacking as is his passing and touch. Finishing is the only great aspect he has left. He can stretch defences but struggles to hold up play and get others involved, something rvp is still very good at. I would love a pacy striker who isn't afraid to go past a centre back. Sturridge, Kane, aguero and costa are all well ahead of our lot at the moment.

4333~~~
Listen, i'm not going to sit here and say Rooney has been out this world since he's been moved up top, but despite it not being particularly hard, he's been easily better than Van Persie and Falcao, both when up top on his own and part of a front two, in my opinion.

4334~~~
Such a shame that he's been bizarrely dumped in CM for most of the season.

If we'd played Rooney up front all season I honestly think we'd be sat comfortably in 3rd right now.

4335~~~
Did someone put a weird voodoo curse on him at half-time?

4336~~~
I think we should be aspiring for more. A complete forward is something we lack.

4337~~~
Our problems lie much deeper than that. Get the right players around Rooney, and he can be as good as any forward in the league, in my opinion. He's scored 4 in his last 5 with limited service. Other strikers, especially Van Persie and Falcao, would have struggled to make that sort of impact.

4338~~~
He was in all the right places today and would have scored more if someone could just get a pass through to him. Keep him upfront even though as a midfielder he plays better than any of our midfielders did today.

4339~~~
Wouldn't have any other forward in the league over him (including Aguero).. I am sure most won't agree though but that's fine.

4340~~~
I just want someone good to partner him.

4341~~~
Well if Rooney was playing for City, i'm sure he'd have just as much goals as Aguero, given the the creativity he's got around him.

4342~~~
Who's available that's better than Rooney?

I'd put Aguero over him but that's it.

4343~~~
We just need to surround him with a #10 and a winger who has that ingenious spark about him. De Bruyne + a wide forward like Depay, for instance. Rooney will indefinitely provide a side with goals and assists from upfront, and has a good few years left within him.

4344~~~
Which "more complete forward" should we sign?

4345~~~
Played half the season in midfield and yet has what, 13-14 goals for the season despite us having no CL football? That's a brilliant return and he's the "20 goals a season" striker LvG wants. As for getting someone better, I think only Aguero and maybe Costa are better than him in the role and neither are available. The likes of Benzema and Cavani aren't anywhere as good as him.

4346~~~
Showing that once he gets a run up front on his own he can be a world class striker. He showed it every time he had one for us over the years, but has constantly been moved around for other players because he's versatile and works hard. 
His versatility was really more of a burden for him IMO. If he was only a striker, he would have long ago became our all time top scorer and would be without a doubt one of the top 3 strikers in the world every year. Hopefully van Gaal doesn't try and move him around again, not even as a #10. Hes at his best up front without a doubt. RvP can go as a #10 and we'd be better off for it when he comes back.

4347~~~
To be fair, half of that 'service' has been uncontested strikes from the spot.

Out of curiousity, why do you think most won't agree?

4348~~~
He had a good game. His problem though is his inability to beat a defender or to create space for a shot. And he knows he has this weakness as he shies away from taking defenders on. One sequence had him with the ball dribbling towards the box and 1st defender, makes his one move, doesn't get around defender, takes another dribble to his right, and then ends up going backwards to pass to a mid. 5 years ago Rooney would have blazed past the first defender and shot.

4349~~~
This season alone kane, aguero, costa, Sanchez, Icardi, lacazette, griezmann, benzema would be better. Berahino, bony about even and even Ings and Austin have been better overall. Pointless 
discussing with you though because you will never find a fault in Rooneys performances, just like you will forever criticize rvp since you didn't want him to sign for us.

4350~~~
Spot kicks don't count the same for other players though.

4351~~~
Benzema has been mediocre. Berahino, Ings and Austin over Rooney? Wow you really do hate the guy. Rooney has barely played as striker and has 13-14 goals this season. Kane has had half a good season so I'm not sure I'll take him over someone who's been performing for a decade. Aguero and Costa are the only ones who are better than Rooney in your entire list and they're unattainable.

4352~~~
Sanchez has been better out of that list as well. Although to be fair, even if some of the others have had a better season, I agree that I probably wouldn't take a lot of them ahead of Rooney since having a better season than someone doesn't automatically make them a better overall player, especially when Rooney's generally been a major player for a good number of years now.

4353~~~
Rooney is as good as any of them with, the possible exception of aguero  and better than most of them. I am still laughing at the last 5 you mention.

4354~~~
I'm not sure he was being serious. But it's Rooney so it's definitely possible.

4355~~~
You are laughing because I suggested they are having better seasons than Rooney? Fair enough. Hardly a wild claim is it when none of our attacking player have set the world alight and are ageing.

4356~~~
How many strikers playing now are great finishers and can make their own chances too? 

Not many. And none that are available. Fergie and cows and fields and all that.

4357~~~
A lot of those guys are younger and will only get better whereas Rooney is not as good as he used to be and nearing 30 whilst he has lost a fair bit of his ability from 2009/10 when he had his best season for us.

4358~~~
Brilliant header. Pressed well too at times. I wish he had a partner to link with though, somebody like Wilson maybe? He would benefit more than trying to figure out where the knockon from Fellaini is going.

4359~~~
Wilson isn't anywhere near good enough to start for us. Probably prefer him to Fellaini though.

4360~~~
It was hilarious to see him running around in circles trying to figure how where the knock downs were going.

4361~~~
No agenda at all, eh.

4362~~~
Miles better than RVP or Falcao up front. Needs to be starting as our lone striker.

4363~~~
TBH I dont think Wilson has been given a chance. I dont even think Falcao has been given a proper chance.

One thing you can see at the game is how much Rooney works. The problem is the lack of movement behind him and how slow the ball comes to him. Its a reason he drops so much to try and get the ball (this was more evident second half though)

4364~~~
Yeah, Benzema has been mediocre but Rooney is great. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4365~~~
Christ that's an awful list. You know what "complete" means, right?

Think you have me confused with someone else btw. I was delighted when we signed Van Persie and thoroughly enjoyed his first season at United. The only difference between you and me is that I can see he's been wank for most of the last two seasons but you're still besotted with him, for some strange reason.

That and your frankly deluded opinions on Rooney.

4366~~~
There is no 'possible exception ' about it.

4367~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You probably haven't even watched half of them this season, yes this season, where none of our attacking players have been standing out but of course anything bad said about your golden boy you have to jump right in there and get all defensive about it. Same in the Valencia thread, been the same for years. So wank yet still had a better goal to game ratio than Rooney, yet you bang on about Rooney's stats all the time trying to prove he's up there with Aguero.

4368~~~
Charlie Austin,Danny Ings,Wilfried Bony and Berahino over Rooney?

4369~~~
I clearly said they have had better seasons than him.

4370~~~
Pretty basic stuff this, play him up top and play Mata behind him. That's the only way we're reaching top 4 imo. Anything else will see us gracing Europa league of our presence. Hopefully LVG figures that out in time. He'll get us the goals, we all know he bangs em in for fun when he plays there. He also has a good all round game but what I'm more interested in is him putting the ball in the back of the net so we can start collecting enough points for 4th. We should be looking to sign a second striker in the summer to play behind him if we aren't convinced by Mata, and a new manager will do nicely.

4371~~~
Christ. Berahino, ings, Austin, bony, griezmann,  Icardi Kane better strikers? You're out of your mind if you think that. Even benzema isn't better but has had a better season since Rooney has been moved around so much. Only costa and aguero are better strikers then him. You can't say this season when he's hardly played as one, but when he has played hes scored anyways more or less.

4372~~~
Even when RvP comes back from injury, and if he has to come back in the team, I'd rather keep Rooney up front and put Van Persie in the #10 role. Who knows, it might actually work a lot better then Rooney behind van Persie.

4373~~~
See stuff like that reveals you to be a bit of a cretin. Sorry but there you go. It has to be said. You know he's played most of the season in central midfield, right?

4374~~~
Last season.

4375~~~
He is the best striker we have, but that doesn't mean he is good enough. For now he'll do but he needs replacing in the next 2 seasons IMO

4376~~~
That period of playing Rooney in midfield is looking increasingly more stupid by the game. Can't believe it took this long to move him forward, LVG & Giggs' biggest mistake so far IMO as its cost us a lot of points over Christmas/Jan period IMO. Does anyone have Rooney's goal scoring stats when he has played up top, can imagine them being good reading.

4377~~~
Has he has lost a fair bit of explosiveness, flair, the ability to consistently fashion chances for himself and the threat on the ball which made defenders back off him before? Yes, no two ways about it and it is natural given that he's not a bustling 22 year old Rooney anymore but rather a more experienced 29 year old.

However, he's still extremely clinical, more composed, retains the same industry without the fieriness, possesses good hold up play and link up play (up front). He might not be the most technical of forwards granted but for all his flaws, he is still ridiculously productive and has so much more going for him.

I doubt if we will ever see the Rooney of 09/10 and 11/12 of old up front again but he's good enough to lead the line for United as it is. Besides there is hardly a viable and better alternative out there is there? If someone like Lewandowski becomes available, then I'd agree with you but what are the chances of that?

4378~~~
According to whoscored.
He has played 7 games as a FC and has 2 goals and 2 assists.

His best position this season has been playing at ACM/10 where hes played 4 games with 4 goals and an assist.

4379~~~
19/40
18/28

You are correct.

Still, would like to mention, completely unrelated to anything, that Rooney also had 21 assists, while van Persie had just three.

4380~~~
Not sure I agree with whoscored there. Off the top of my head he's scored vs the following whilst playing up front: Arsenal theother night then Swansea (H), QPR (h), Arsenal (a), Hull (h), Preston (a), Sunderland (h) x 2

4381~~~
Hardly unrelated, in a discussion about "complete strikers".

4382~~~
I know, I was just teasing Orton. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4383~~~
He played as #10 at QPR (behind RVP and Falcao), was a CM at Arsenal (Di Maria and RVP played up top) and was some sort of hybrid CM/AM against Hull.

4384~~~
Not how I remember it...

QPR - was up top with RVP with Mata behind until Falcao came off the bench, Rooney had scored by then.
Arsenal away - yes he started deep but RVP then got subbed and Rooney moved up top and scored.
Hull home - he was up top with RVP, maybe playing slightly off RVP but would still classify that as up top.

4385~~~
Yeah, you're right about QPR. My bad.

Not sure about Arsenal or Hull. I seem to remember Wilson and Di Maria still playing up top after RVP went off.

4386~~~
At least he's working hard, getting into good positions to score goals unlike RVP and Falcao.

4387~~~
You are potentially correct re Arsenal, I didn't enjoy that game one bit so probably blocking it from the memory. All I remember was Rooney furthest forward for his goal so thats maybe blinkering my view!

Hull at home I should really know as I was there but was quite hungover, all I remember is that Hull were pathetic !

4388~~~
I've always felt it would work better that way than how we've tried it. Van Persie is better at creating his own chances and has sensational hold up play. He's also imo a bigger threat from range. Rooney will stretch teams better and is a better box striker. He's also got the workrate to give the defenders and keeper a hell of a lot of problems. I'd be like having the Cole-Cantona combination again. 
-------------Rooney-----------
Young---Van Persie---DiMaria would be potent imo.

4389~~~
That would be great if we had good enough midfield to back it up.
Rooney lacks the dicipline to play that role and allow RVP the space to do his thing in behind IMO I may be wrong, but Rooney will always drop deep even when playing as a 9.
RVP lacks the mobility to help out with the defensive work required from our team when you play as a 10 (because the midfield is light) This is also why Mata is on the bench

4390~~~
He'll always drop deep but if given clear instructions to lead the line he'll do just that. He just isn't a static striker who stands there all game plus he's always working so gets dragged out of position, but has great mobility so will get back in there. He's done that for the past few games since being reinstated as our striker and he's lead the line well. Dropping deep when he needs to, and staying up when he doesn't need too. Its pretty simple, if he feels the team isn't doing well in terms of build up, he's coming to collect it. If they are, he'll stay up top. Intelligence of movement has always been one of his strongest points imo. 

A Carrick-Herrera midfield will do. Not the strongest, imposing of midfields but the league isn't blessed with many great direct through the middle teams so they should cope. Van persie will need to play with more effort to make it work, and I doubt he'd refuse to follow instructions from van gaal. I'd preffer van persie over mata cause he's a bigger goal threat, better in the air and he holds it up better. Mata wouldn't be a factor in a physical battle. We're gonna need goals as our defence has more holes in it than a shower head. 

----------------Rooney---------------
Young------VanPiersie------DiMaria
---------Herrera--Carrick----------
Shaw------Rojo--Smalling----Valencia
-----------------DDG-------------------
Could take us to even 3rd place if the effort is there. We saw in the first half against arsenal that even with the limitation of having the talentless Fellaini our team can dominate the play in the middle of the park.

4391~~~
The main problem though is that RVP's workrate from that position would be quite limited. Granted he'd be good <i>on </i>the ball, but he wouldn't be able to dictate the play in behind the striker in the same way players like, say, Silva or Hazard potentially could. You'd be relying on the midfielders to do a lot of work to get the ball to him.

4392~~~
Not every team needs a silva(don't know why you mention hazard as he's playing nothing like someone who can dictate anything) 
We'd play outside in, rather than inside out. By that I mean the midfielders should get the ball to the wide men, and they'd find van persie instead of playing through van persie unless we're in transition where we could dump it into van persie and he'd turn and pass it to either young, di maria or Rooney.

4393~~~
Fully agreed. It's always been very clear that he only drops deeper when the team is playing shit and he can't get the ball. If everything behind him is going smooth he can stay up top.

4394~~~

If you have 30 minutes of spare time, all his goals for United! Saw it off reddit.

4395~~~
4 goals in 5 games since moving back up top I think, stop dicking him around and play him as the center forward with mata in behind him. The way he brings everyone into play, not to mention his workrate is phenomenal.

4396~~~
Based on the opinions posted in this thread (and many others).

4397~~~
He's showing the kind of form that made him a beast in the 2009/10 season. Get Mata in behind to provide service and we are on to a winner.

4398~~~
<3 I didn't really have 30 minutes, but I watched the whole thing anyway. He's still the heartbeat of the team.

4399~~~
Would anyone here actually swap him for any other striker in the league?

4400~~~
The only ones that cross my mind would be RVP 13/14 or an injury free Aguero. But that's like saying I'd like a Rooney with a better bottom level of performance who never tried to pull off the 12/13 contract shenanigans.

4401~~~
I don't think there are up to 10 strikers in the world i would swap Rooney for

4402~~~

4403~~~
I think its a bit shallow to get hung up on the sex appeal of our players to be honest.

4404~~~
I said possible and meant it, there seems to be a lot of our 'supporters' that do not rate Rooney highly. I can only think they have only seen him on TV or have a lack of football knowledge. Every manager in PL would want Rooney if he was available tomorrow.

4405~~~
Aguero, Costa, and Sanchez without question.  I would consider Sturridge and even Kane.  We have gotten the best from him and it is downhill from here.

4406~~~
Sensible post.

The amount of stick Rooney gets on here is ridiculous and has been for years. He's the only outfield player who has any balls about him and he's done more for us over the past 10 years than most anyone else. Take Rooney and DDG out of the team and we wouldn't even be contemplating a top 4 finish.

4407~~~
Saved us from becoming a complete joke after Ronaldo left.

4408~~~
Rooney is far more clinical than Costa and Sanchez goes hiding in big games. I'm not going to take Kane or Sturridge as serious suggestions.

4409~~~
One of few players to still show saf style fight and passion since the boss left. So much more effective than rvp or falcao upfront, in fact both of them should be booted out of the club at the first available opportunity.

4410~~~

4411~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> spat coffee over your keyboard ?

4412~~~
Yes and he put up Ronaldo-esque EPL numbers aswell, just 4 shy of Ronaldo's 31 goals in one of those seasons

4413~~~
I know some you really like Rooney but to have him as our main/ player striker will result in us winning nothing, just like the England national team. Some would rather get rid of RVP, Falcao and even DiMaria, technically gifted players who are truly world class. With the exception of RVP, due to age, top teams would be glad to have them over Rooney. LVG needs to find a way to get them performing at a level we know they are capable of, specifically, providing them with a truly complementary midfield.
We are Man Utd not Rooney Utd. We won a lot of trophies with him in the team but he was never the main reason why we won any of them.

4414~~~
You'd rather have Falcao than Rooney..... yeah ok.

4415~~~
If we lose Falcao we will probably see him recover his form and regret losing him. RVP and Falcao like the ball played to them in a way they can control, beat a player and shoot. He is world class our central midfield is not.

4416~~~
I hope Falcao does get back to his best, but for 43m and at the age of 29 not at United thanks.

4417~~~
A national team that also included Rio,Terry,Cole,Lampard and Gerrard, but yeah Rooney is the only one to blame for England's woes.
Don't think anyone has ever referred to the team as "Rooney UTD", and his work ethic,goals and assists have been critical in our successful seasons, the 2 seasons he scored 25+ goals, we finished 2nd, which is 3 places above where we would have ended up without his goals, you will never get a better star striker who can successfully make that transition to a supporting role to allow players like RVN,RVP,Berba,Saha etc to operate effectively.

As for your "technically gifted players" they have struggled to do anything this season, the only outfield player in our team that would get into another TOP team right now is Rooney, being consistent in scoring numerous goals and assists in over a decade is NOT a fluke.

4418~~~
Our Central Midfield hasn't been world class in a long time, hasn't stopped our strikers from getting 20+ goals though.

4419~~~
United is such a silly, not top team.

4420~~~
Only Aguero.

4421~~~
If we'd played him up top all along we'd be better off than we are now. Leave him up there the rest of the season.

4422~~~
Only Aguero from that list (and even then I'd be hesitant given his injury record.) Costa and Sanchez need to do it over a longer period of time to show they'd be worth swapping Rooney for. Remember how good Torres was in his first few years? Imagine if we'd had the opportunity to swap Rooney for him? As for Sturridge and Kane, I simply don't think either is as good as Rooney, simply as that. 

If I had to draw up a list of who I'd have over Rooney, it'd probably be:

Messi (he is a striker, is he not?), Ronaldo, Suarez, Aguero, Neymar (although I wonder how well he'd do in the Prem,) and...... I can't think of anyone else. Perhaps Ibrahimovic?

4423~~~
You do realise that Falcao's control this year has been shocking and neither he nor RVP have got pace nor any spring from their knackered legs to get past anyone?

Full story. It's meant to have happened earlier this year. Rooney's improved recently, so I wonder if it's worth making Falcao and Di Maria fight Bardsley as well?

4433~~~
Kane.

4434~~~
Since Aguero has come to England, he has played 7 mroe games than Rooney (on all club competitions).

Would undoubtedly swap Rooney with him, while would have been tempted to swap him with Sanchez and Costa (if he wasn't the biggest cnut in universe). Sturridge and Kane might be better in long term, but now I really don't think that they're better than Wayne (or would be better for us than Rooney).

Around the world, then Messi, Ronaldo, Bale, Neymar, Reus, Suarez (if he wasn't the second biggest cnut in the universe), Robben, Muller and Lewandovski.

4435~~~
Boxing celebration for sure.

4436~~~
Pathetic. What a stupid thing to do, he's very lucky he didn't smash his head of the chair behind him.

It's out if order that one of his "mates" that he let in his family home has the cheek to leak the video.

4441~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> A fecking jab knocked him out.

4442~~~
What with all the phone hacking that's gone on for ever, it's possible that no one actually leaked this.

4443~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> No wonder his boxing career never took off!

4444~~~
His head was very close to the table when he fell down.

4445~~~
Of those Messi Ronaldo best 2 in world - Suarez close behind. The rest all have question marks as far as i am concerned.

 Neymar - not sure he would handle PL
 Reus, Robben, Bale and Muller are more attacking midfielders than strikers, mainly playing wide.
 Lewandovski not one of my favourites, misses a lot of chances everytime i watch him play.

4446~~~
Bardsley has pop!

4447~~~
Rooney has turned into such a shite athlete over the past 5 years. A 19 year old Rooney would have smashed his face in.

4448~~~
I, for one, am shocked at the idea of a couple of young guys - who happen to be footballers - doing something mildly daft.

4449~~~
Totally agree. I remember a time when Rooney used to get punched in the face in his kitchen and he'd just laugh at them and go out and score the winning touchdown in the Super Bowl 10 minutes later. Sell Rooney, buy Brooklyn Beckham

4450~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4454~~~
Having a laugh with your jobless lazy mates is fine...but don't challenge a professional athlete to a round of boxing ffs!

Bardsley might be an average PL player but he will still be in the gym every week, in the words of SAF "he could have been killed"

4455~~~
How embarrassing. We couldn't even beat stoke at home!

4456~~~
What the actual feck?!? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4457~~~
Bardsley's got some moves. Impressive.

4458~~~
We pay him 200k+ and made him Captain of club and country in the belief he would know better than to do this kind of crap.

Every time i start to warm to him again he does something like this.

4459~~~
Can he get in trouble for this? You can bet your bottom dollar that the FA are scrambling through the rule book now.

4460~~~
The silly bugger. If he's hit his head on something he might have died.<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> Although if I was there I would probably have been more concerned about the crockery in the background. That's a woman for you.

4461~~~
Juan Mata for captain. Literally the only guy in the team I can't imagine doing something similar in his "own" time. Rooneys just hounded and sells papers.....this is nothing for me, genuinely strange that United fans are the only ones seemingly taking it so seriously. He deserves a bit of stick for it and that's pretty much it.

4462~~~
Can he demand a rematch?

4463~~~
Exactly, we all know he's a bit thick, no harm done, move on.

4464~~~
Must be killing everyone on RAWK that this embarrassing video has The Sun all over it.

4465~~~
Not sure I want him in the trenches with me if that's the best he can punch. My seven year old can probably pack a better one.

4466~~~
It's just a bit of fun.

On a general level it's incredibly stupid to do it on hard flooring next to a dinner table, mind.

He should have moved his sofa's about to make a ring instead.

4467~~~
He wouldn't have felt the need to box if Van Gaal had just played him more in the box.

4468~~~
The horror, THE HORROR!!

4469~~~
Let him have a crack off Butterbean.

4470~~~
You just know Bardsley is going to be playing this up for the rest of his career.
Seriously though, who gets knocked spark out by a jab?

4471~~~

4472~~~
Woah, didn't know you had it in you, Beardsley. Nice punch.

4473~~~
I know you're not being serious but we criticise footballers, managers etc every week. Doesn't mean we'd actually do any better.

4474~~~
I know it is supposed to have happened a couple of months ago, but will all this servicing today you can bet your bottom dollar that this will affect him today.

4475~~~
If he scores today he should have his celebration as someone knocking him out

4476~~~
That would be comical. He has to do it.

4477~~~
What I don't get is how he get knocked out clean by a otherwise fairly harmless jab? Glass chin.

4478~~~
A young Rooney knocked Sol Campbell out in the tunnel. Scholes is right, peaked before his peak.

4479~~~
Watched this over the past few days, such satisfying viewing. The amount of absolute crackers in there is impressive, a Rooney top 20 goals would be a sight to behold. I know his City goal will always top any rankings like that, but I think the Newcastle goal is my favourite.

4480~~~
Well, it would have been the head banging against the floor that knocked him out.

4481~~~
Are people actually outraged? Seriously? Wow.

4482~~~
I find myself liking Phil Bardsley a lot more all of a sudden.

4483~~~
I don't know if you ever boxed or practiced martial arts but you can't judge a jab on video, and you can knocked out someone who doesn't have a good chin with a jab or a check. Bardsley could also be a heavy striker.

4484~~~
Outraged isn't the right emotion.

I am sat here thinking they're both utter tits though.

Look at the way he fell - could've been quite nasty had his head collided with a granite work surface, or something of that ilk.

They're just silly feckers with too much time on their hands. Rooney and Bardsley are both nearly 30, and yet they're sparring in the kitchen. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4485~~~
It's just more ammo for the usual suspects.

4486~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> thread title

4487~~~
At least it wasn't Coleen with the rolling pin.

4488~~~
The way he goes down is very satisfying to watch for some reason. 10/10.

4489~~~
I'm shocked personally, I'm fine with the fight but doing it in the kitchen is very dangerous, they should have done that in the garden.

4490~~~
That's not real, is it?

4491~~~
He went down like he had been hit by a Shawn Michael superkick. 10/10 for the sell.

4492~~~
I love it. At least it wasn't bare knuckle.

4493~~~
Nah man, kitchen boxing has always been fake.

4494~~~
What?

4495~~~
Very surprised at the comical nature of the reactions in here.

Rooney's head was extremely close to hitting that wooden furniture above his unconscious head.

Thus very well could have ended fatally. He's more dumb than I thought. Pity he's such a good footballer.

4496~~~
I'm trying to work out how that friendship has come about.

4497~~~
Thank God he didn't hit that table. 

Would have been the most tragic, and yet the most comical death ever.

4498~~~
They both played for the same team and are a pair of idiots?

4499~~~
Played together for a couple of seasons here.

4500~~~
More puns, please.

4501~~~
Manchester 1 Liverpool 0

4502~~~
Boxing in the kitchen ... IQ is way to strong in some.

4503~~~
Can see him getting the hook today

4504~~~
Does Van Gaal say something to Rooney about this? 

On one hand, Rooney is a grown man and this was in private, on the other hand it's his captain and I can't imagine players are allowed to box in their spare time.

4505~~~
£10k worth of weave and he still gets lumped!

4506~~~
Campbell refused to shake Rooney's hand during the Pizzagate game and then Rooney knocked him out in the tunnel, reportedly.

4507~~~
When it comes to fighting captains Lawman, Keano and Eric beat him hands down (or up).

4508~~~
I've never heard of that before - surely can't be true? Sol's a mountain of a man, there's not a chance Rooney could take him out, and then for that information to never get out. 

Edit - googling 'Rooney knocks out Sol Campbell' and this thread is the third and fourth link. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4509~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

What the feck!

4510~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I've never heard that one before.

4511~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Some of you are massively overreacting.

4512~~~
One time I was playing Pro Evo with a friend, United vs Arsenal, I'm defending and lose the ball in my penalty area, I lunge with a defender and rip the arsenal player in half. It goes to the cut scene of the referee running up to show the red card and award a penalty, but he keeps on running...and running some more...until he passes the half-way line, reaches the other side of the pitch where Sol Campbell, standing in his own area, is given a red card! My friend exploded in rage, it was the most ridiculous and impossible decision to give, he was the second furthest player on the pitch from the tackle, and in the replay you can see him just standing completely still while the tackle happened. Anyway I won the game, Campbell got sent off and now I don't discount any story with Sol Campbell, no matter how ridiculous it is.

4513~~~
Let's hope he puts in a top performance today then after his world class return to the centre forward position with 4 goals (2 pens) in 5 games. Tottenham will be quaking in their boots at the thought.

4514~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that is a proper knockout. I was expecting a little stumble.

4515~~~
Why the fecking kitchen of all places?

Maybe Rooney is part Saiyan and getting his ass kicked makes him stronger.

4516~~~
Agree. Can't wait till half time when Falcao is doing his warm ups on the pitch so we can see if he can do one of his touches again. Breathtaking stuff.

4517~~~
Its scripted, not fake.

4518~~~
No, let's hope he plays really badly and we lose, just so you can feel personally vindicated in your bizarre campaign of bile and hatred towards the man.

Because that's what's important here.

4519~~~
It's still real to me, damn it.

4520~~~
If it gets a player sent off and ultimately wins us the game then why not. Just like Rooneys amazing work rate that won us the game at Newcastle and not his sitter he missed in the first half.

I'd love to see him play well today, then I'd actually understand why people are praising him so much for a few so-so performances up front like he's messi.

4521~~~
"Chin up, Wazza."

4522~~~
That clearly hasn't happened though so you're getting all wound up about it for nothing.

4523~~~
Ahh Orton is getting precious again! Got to admire his continued persistence. Always on the thread (and any Rooney thread) spewing out the same bile no matter how Rooney plays.

4524~~~
How on earth do these videos get leaked? Surely everyone in that room knew each other and therefore knew how controversial this footage is. Unless Phil said 'PUT IT ON FACEBOOK!' whilst the unconscious Rooney was swallowing his tongue I can't see how this got out. If I was paying an athlete 300k a week to be at his best physically and to display that on the football pitch I would be livid tbh. Funny as feck though imo as Waynes personal life seems to have one feck up after another <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4525~~~
Considering he's been praised so much since going up top and contributing 2 open play goals and not much more than the other 2 strikers then I think it's fair to say he's getting massively overrated again. Nice header against Arsenal but not so much praise for the creator of the goal with the most pin point cross of the season. Hope he does well obviously but it's weird seeing everyone rate his performances as brilliant just because Falcao isn't playing anymore, and also contradicting themselves saying he's better as a pure striker not getting involved in the build up yet still the heartbeat of the team? How does that one work

4526~~~
I expect that behaviour (organising a fight in the kitchen) from teenagers, but not from grown men (Rooney is a father).
If they wanted to practise their boxing skills, then they could've gone to a boxing gym, where they'd be taught properly to box and could've had a nice, long sparring session.
In the right environment, boxing is relatively safe.

And judging by Rooney going down to easily, he isn't cut out to fight, so should stay well away. I didnt think that a professional elite level athlete can go down so easily.

Can you imagine the furore which would've resulted if he hit his head and ended up in hospital.

4527~~~
Jesus that KO is brutal. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Can't believe what I'm watching

4528~~~
Fs

4529~~~
Any RKO outta nowhere gifs?

4530~~~
Up top, we have had Falcao, RVP and Di Maria.
All these guys have been dire. Falcao shouldnt be playing in the EPL. RVP - something is wrong with this guy and I'm not quite sure what. And Di Maria ran around like a headless chicken in the 2 games he played as striker.
Rooney comes in and immediately starts scoring.

You can understand why we are praising Rooney so much. We are desperate for a striker who can actually score.
Most of us are sick and tired of non-scoring strikers.

4531~~~
Orton really is hilarious. He just doesn't stop <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4532~~~
He's off his rocker, it's kind of tragic really.

4533~~~
Yes, sorry I don't rate precious Wayne as our best player. Must be mental whilst all of you lot fail to see any flaw in his game. When was his last massive performance again? Certainly don't see him pulling us through many games these days.

4534~~~
Strawman. The most people have been saying he's played better than RVP or Falcao, which he has. No one's saying he's been brilliant or anything of the sort (though I do think he was very good in the 1st half vs Arsenal).

Strawman again. That's pretty much all you on this thread. Build up ridiculous arguments and then talk shite to justify your position.

And you must not read this thread very carefully if you think no one sees any flaws in his game. Rooney's game is analyzed more closesly than any other player on this forum which results in him getting ott stick from people like you.

4535~~~
Like I said, you're deranged and reading things that aren't there.

4536~~~
Wrong, people said he was brilliant against Arsenal, why's that? Because he scored? The praise he received compared to the stick other players receive after games is strange. He was useless against Sunderland till they went down to ten but obviously since he scored a penalty which changed the game he's the best striker we have, right? Falcao has been crap, I haven't said anything otherwise recently, but praising someones contribution for scoring penalties when downplaying other strikers for doing the same thing (Leicester game) is just hypocritical.

4537~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> the faux outrage

4538~~~
WOOOORLD STAR BRUV, WOORLD STAR HEEM SLEEPY.

Seriously though, how the feck can you be friends with Phil Bardsley? Who's next, Voldemort from Swansea?

4539~~~
Imagining things I guess.

4540~~~
Didn't Rooney box a bit when he was growing up?
All the dancing about and then they just stand there trading shots..

4541~~~
Our 'captain' is an idiot.

4542~~~
Can't believe people are actually annoyed by this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I said the other week when 3 or 4 of the Everton team were getting in Bardsley face that I would fancy him to have them all...

4543~~~
After watching it for several times it looks staged to me.  He wasn't out at all he Cushing the fall with his arms and somewhat finds himself under the table.  No one is panicking either..

4544~~~
Big whoop

4545~~~
Yep 4 posts, only one of which says he was class which he was in the first half vs Arsenal.

Don't embarrass yourself. If someone sat down to multiquote all your posts in this thread it'd make the readings of a man desperate to discredit anything Wayne Rooney does.

You are as bad if not worse than all the people you accuse of having an agenda.

4546~~~
What is he doing being friends with Phil Bardsley? If that's the kind of company he's keeping, no wonder his performances have declined over the last few years. Embarrassing for a Manchester United and England captain.

Rooney to score the winner today. 

Papers to run with "knockout blow from Rooney"

Or we lose and " another knockout blow for United and Rooney"

4548~~~
Best player, better than our midfielders in midfield, complete forward, using the whole <b>we don't create chances</b> excuse for him... You see, that is the same excuse that was used for RVP and Falcao. What happened to the complete forward who creates his own chances?

4549~~~
Yes, you are <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4550~~~
Pink oven gloves <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4551~~~
He's still scoring, which instantly puts him above Falcao and RvP.

4552~~~
Faux outrage? It was a pretty silly thing to do when you are a professional athlete.

4553~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I'm surprised how easily he went down. Not surprising he didn't have the common sense not to be fighting in the kitchen. Lucky he wasn't badly hurt.

4554~~~
Ummmmm what ?

4555~~~
To be honest, he is quite lucky his head did not bounce off that chair. A concussion could mean a few weeks out..

4556~~~
Very surprised to see Rooney go down so easily. He looks like he could take more than that. 

So dumb to be sparring in the kitchen though. If he properly hit his head on the way down, imagine the outcome.

4557~~~
He's got a weaker chin than Amir Khan.

4558~~~
It was after the Swansea match....since then 2 goals against Sunderland + He has played a big part in our goal against Newcastle + He has scored against Arsenal = FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT WAYNE!!!!

This this this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

----
A lot of you are getting bent out of shape about what <a class="username" data-user="19613, @Orton" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19613/">@Orton</a> says, but he's actually correct on quite a few points. There's a lot of hyperbole about his performances. RvP scored two against So'ton and did very little else and got slated for it. Rooney scored against Arse and did nothing else but the way he's spoken about, you'd think he dominated their defence.

4560~~~
Will be banned by FA

4561~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he went down like a sack of shit, I could hear the thud from my headphones that are places about 2 feet away from me.

4562~~~
Can we add 'Ko's - 1' to his stat bar at the top?

4563~~~
It's something not worth the outrage, but, doing it in the kitchen was really dangerous, it reminded me of that turkish girl in germany that was punched by a guy in a car park, fell on her head and died.

4564~~~
He's always been an idiot so it's hardly surprising, good luck with any career in boxing when you get KO'd by a jab.

4565~~~
Fecking hell that's hilarious <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4566~~~
I'm baffled by this. So many questions.

4567~~~
Scott Brown is worst

4568~~~
went down like Ashley Young <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4569~~~
Just meant it was no surprise to find out he was an 'idiot', we already know that! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4570~~~
Oh right-yea exactly. He's never had sense!

4571~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What the feck? Great thread title too. Fairly stupid thing to do, as has been said. Could get hurt with the way he falls. Been said to death at this stage. Surely won';t be any punishment for this, other than to say cop-on. Also some "friend" to leak this to the fecking Sun.

4572~~~
I think it's clearly sensationalist journalism (ie. I've no doubt he jumped right back up after the video stopped.) That being said, is it really a good idea for our 250,000/week striker to be boxing (sans headgear,) during his free time?

4573~~~
Has it been confirmed to be a recent event?

4574~~~
I believe it was after the Swansea game?

The week later he scored a couple against Sunderland, so let's hope someone has knocked him out again recently.

4575~~~
Has anyone else on here heard this story before?

Something like that would be urban legend by now, surely?

4576~~~
It's interesting the way it cuts out so soon after he goes down. There's no way the dude on the video stopped recording. Wouldn't be suprised at all if he's only messing around and sits straight up. Sun being the Sun.

4577~~~
So far <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4578~~~
Glad I'm not the only one who thinks that.

It was extremely gentle sparring. No power at all in their punches. They both look like tidy boxers, who know how to spar (which is very different to an actual fight). They'd be well able to have a relaxed spar without headgear and not get hurt.

4579~~~
Best Striker in the league !

The celebration <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4582~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> His celebration.

4583~~~
What a goal! hahahahahah boxing him self out.. love him

4584~~~
Someone needs to photoshop Ortons face onto Rooney and Rooney's face onto Bardsley.

4585~~~
Loved that Wayne! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4586~~~
Good celebration <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4587~~~
Absolute legend! Get the feck in!

4588~~~
Well done, sir.

4589~~~

4590~~~
What a great goal. I love those goals where he 'hunts' the goal down. Hasn't done it enough in his later career, but where he can get the ball 25 yards out dribble past a few and score. He's done it at the Lane before as well.

4591~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fecking legend

4592~~~

Brilliant!

4593~~~
Couldn't have possibly responded better to what was a nothing story with a lot of faux outrage

4594~~~
The best celebration, ever! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4595~~~
A little bit. The video would have been much funnier if they were boxing naked.

4596~~~
Erm....

4597~~~
Great goal. Refreshing to see him run at players.

4598~~~

4599~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Its really refreshing to see the front man making runs and trying to take on players, I wouldn't mind if RvP and Falcao don't play again this season to be honest.

4600~~~
There's your 20 goal a season striker Louis. Or 25. Or 30. Or more.

4601~~~
For the love of everything keep playing him as a forward.

4602~~~
So much for the his finished/has no pace brigade.

4603~~~
Brilliant celebration <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4604~~~
Hasn't gone past players like that and scored in a long time. Great goal.

4605~~~
He's just great.

4606~~~
Wayne Rooney running at defenders is a wonderful thing.

4607~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Fantastic celebration, nice goal too

4608~~~
If he had played up top all season we'd probably be challenging for the title. He'd have another five to ten goals to his name.

A striker that runs, it's amazing.

4609~~~
class celebration <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4610~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4611~~~
Nice goal, and that celebration was hilarious, fair play to him. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4612~~~
He's been class, having a dynamic striker up top is a joy to watch.

4613~~~
Boom!

4614~~~
Needs to play up front. Has been very good so far

4615~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I like Rooney. He's a real character. We can all see how much he loves scoring and celebrating goals, so why mess with his best position?

4616~~~
He <i>really </i>wanted to score that goal so he could do that celebration. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4617~~~
It would be amazing if Bardsley had actually knocked him out like that...using a four punch mega combo to the face.

4618~~~
Needs 20 goals now

4619~~~
Brilliant goal and celebration <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4620~~~
That pass to Fellaini with the outside of his foot<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4621~~~
So I just saw this video, now I know what his celebration was about <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Now just twenty goals behind Sir Bobby.

4623~~~
Today, he was Captain Marvel! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4624~~~
Great response <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4625~~~
Lead the line brilliantly. Great to see him get a goal because usually a few more follow.

Should keep his place in the upfront regardless of RVP's fitness.

We need goals and he is the one who can provide them for us. Especially away from home. Hopefully him and Di Maria will continue to linkup next weekend.

4626~~~
The worst bunch of people on the Caf are those who hate/don't rate Rooney. Where are they when he performs like that? Fantastic performance, as a player and captain.

Quality hold up play, good movement, good goal and showed great commitment during the last 10 minutes to make sure we end the game with a clean sheet.

I adore the guy. Chuffed that he's doing well for us up front.

4627~~~
It's well known I'm not his biggest fan but he was fantastic today.

Just keep him up front in a 4-3-3 and the whole team will be better balanced.

4628~~~
Magnificent performance and celebration, his goal sums him up. Complete workhorse.

Rooney can't play upfront by himself?

4629~~~
Great post match interview, spot on with everything he said.

4630~~~
Superb performance.

4631~~~
That's whats most annoying. If LVG hadn't been doing all this shite to accomodate Falcao and RVP and had just played Rooney up there we wouldnt be in this scrap for 4th place.

4632~~~
Fair play to him he done well today. A lot sharper too.

4633~~~
That was a brilliant performance today, hats off to him.

4634~~~
Excellent performance, play like that till the end of the season and we can get 2nd! And <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> at the celebration

4635~~~
Great today, very dangerous, lively and things were coming off

4636~~~
Proving once again he's comfortably the best striker we've got at the moment. Quite an energised performance at times as well.

4637~~~
he's our best forward and our best player too, I just wish we'd played him up front all season.

4638~~~
It took him a few games to get re-acquainted with the striker position and now it's so obvious to everyone he's our best one and should be leading the line even if RVP is fit.

4639~~~
I'd love Van Gaal to simply keep RVP on the bench but cant see it happening. Hopefully its Rooney alongside him and not back in midfield, that'd be just mental.

4640~~~
Love him!

4641~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Brilliant performance today, must be our line leader for the foreseeable future.

4642~~~
I know LVG can be quite stubborn sometimes, but right now I can't see him dropping Rooney back to midfield. Would be an incredibly daft move for him to make. I'm not sure if RVP will get back into the team for a while if we can continue to play like this.

4643~~~
I think we'l see Rooney playing behind RVP. Hope to god I'm wrong though.

4644~~~
I could take Rooney in a sort of number 10 role since he'd be able to still pose an attacking threat there, although I desperately hope we don't drop him back to midfield.

4645~~~
Though the lesser evil, I dont even want him as the No 10. He's the only striker we have (bar Wilson) that has pace and that is v v important. I just want to see him upfront and nowhere else.

4646~~~
Yeah, I'd agree with that right now. He's managing to both score goals, while not being too isolated up front in that he's able to contribute to our overall play too.

4647~~~
Someone starts to walk in the opposite direction (i.e. away from Wayne) as soon as he goes down as well - there's no panic that he's hurt himself. It looks staged.

4648~~~
The blow from Bardsley has rejigged a few neural pathways.

He's like Homer Simpson after listening to the vocabulary tapes.

4649~~~

4650~~~
Exactly what I thought about it. They're just messing around and the Sun is being its usual self.

4651~~~

4652~~~
Not too pleased with the media by the sounds of that.

4653~~~
"our lawyers are watching"...is that from the Sun? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4654~~~
I think if we had played him up on his own the whole season we'd be up there with Chelsea. Speculation and hindsight I know, but he's just so good, always gets into all the right position and his finishing is so much better than when he was in his early twenties. Keep him upfront and we'll get top four IMO... I love van Persie, but he really shouldn't come back into it for now when he returns to fitness.

4655~~~
Yeah, LVG was annoyed with it too.

4656~~~
Well of course, who would be? It's fecking ridiculous, the whole thing, and so are the people on here who picked up on it.

4657~~~
He answered those questions really well post match.

4658~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Quality celebration, I knew he'd do something like that. It's a shame the media have to make such a big deal out of the video. I don't see anything wrong with what happened.

4659~~~
Superb today. It's incredible to think that he'd ever be played in another position. A real captain's performance today (and I've not often said those words about Rooney.)

4660~~~
Nice, he's been there and done it all on the biggest stage so hopefully he can use his experience to help the other players.

I agree that people not rating Rooney is stupid as he's clearly a quality player but what's wrong with people not liking him?

4661~~~

4662~~~
Fantastic celebration <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4665~~~

4666~~~
we should get phil to chin him prior to the dippers game.

4667~~~
I'm glad to say I've always been a big fan of Wayne. But I will admit that I thought his days upfront were coming to an end. I thought his best position would be midfield but he is clearly proving me wrong.

Lvg needs to see this so he can get it sorted for next season. As much as I want falcao to succeed I think we need to let him go, keep rvp and build the team around rooney as the target man.

4668~~~
Keep him up front and he will take us home but Van Gaal will stay true to form and bring his blue eyed boy straight in, costing us the season in the process.

4669~~~
And I'm not one to kneejerkingly have a go at people, who constantly criticises a player, just after they've played well but all rooney haters need to strongly re-evaluate their argument. It is moronic how much abuse he gets on here. Maybe it's his personal life and the contract situation (which imo was mainly down to his cnut of an agent, Paul Stretford).

4670~~~
Great game from him today and good to see he is taking the stupid knock out headlines as what it is, a big fat joke.

4671~~~
Letting this captaincy go to his head...and it's just we've needed. Brilliant today, and he can lift us if he keeps it up the rest of the season. Do it again at Angield and we'll be flying.

Fingers crossed LVG sees what's working and doesn't automatically go back to what wasn't when RVP returns.

4672~~~
I saw that on Sportsnet after the match too. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Funniest stuff I've seen in a while after his goal today.

4673~~~
Can't play as striker anymore apparently.

4674~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OVmOluFwAvn/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

4675~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

He's been a fantastic captain this season. Done everything he had to, has worked hard for the team and often been excellent. Even today, after putting in a great shift as a #9 he dropped back for the last 10 minutes and was crucial in ensuring we kept a clean sheet. De Gea has been our player of the season, but Rooney is really not that far behind.

4676~~~
He'll retire as the clubs highest goal scorer and go down as one of the best United players of all time. When Rooney is playing well, he is one of the best players in the league, however when he's playing as striker and has a bad game its not as obvious because he can still score. When he plays deeper and has a bad game is glaringly obvious. Is there another striker as good as him who is anywhere near as versatile?

4677~~~
Was just looking up Rooney's Manchester United goalscoring stats compared to some other great strikers of modern football and it makes for pleasant reading :

Wayne Rooney : 0.49 goals per match in all competitions.
Raul Gonzalez : 0.44 goals per match match in all competitions for Real Madrid.
Andriy Shevchenko : 0.49 goals per match in all competitions for AC Milan.
Thierry Henry : 0.56 goals per game in all competitions for Arsenal and Barcelona.
Filippo Inzaghi : 0.46 goals per game in all competitions for Juventus and AC Milan.
David Villa : 0.50 goals per game in all competitions for Real Zaragoza, Valencia and Barcelona. 
Zlatan Ibrahimovic : 0.48 goals per game in all competitions for Juventus, Internazionale, Barcelona, AC Milan and PSG.
Samuel Eto'o : 0.50 goals per game in all competitions for Barcelona and Internazionale.
Ruud van Nistelrooy : 0.68 goals per game for Manchester United and Real Madrid.

There are only two strikers who are substantially better in terms of goal efficiency from that list - van Nistelrooy with 0.68 and Henry with 0.56. And from that list, almost no other player has been more of a utility man or been played out of position more frequently or contributed more to the team's overall playing style both offensively and defensively. Which makes Rooney's tally all the more impressive when compared to strikers who were more classical finishers in the mold of Inzaghi.

Short term - Rooney is currently on 227 goals for Manchester United and 46 for England; and should be able to surpass Sir Bobby's total of 249 and 49 sometime next season. Plus, he is on 168 league goals for Manchester United and should eclipse Henry's record of 174 goals for a single Premier League club this season considering that there are still 9 games left to play.

More longer term - There is Alan Shearer's record of 260 Premier League goals plus Raul's benchmark of goals for a single club at 323 in all competitions. Surpassing both of them would be an incredible achievement and should finally put a stamp on Rooney's legendary career.

The solitary knock on him would be the relative lack of Champions League goals with just 29. Decent figures but considering how someone like Benzema has 41 and Drogba 44, Rooney should be better placed after almost a decade of playing in the competition. He still has time to make up for it and would do well to get somewhere around 50 by the time he hangs up his boots.

4678~~~
I wish I could archive all these posts somehow. Whenever Rooney goes through a bad patch/gets a kicking in the media and everyone suddenly agrees that he's always been mediocre and overrated and that we'd be better off without him, I find myself wishing I could quote the praise he rightly earns most of the time.

4679~~~
Keep him up top and watch all the records crumble.

4680~~~
Pretty sure that's what Bardsley's missus said happened.

4681~~~
Haven't been a fan of Rooneys performances this season, but really liked what I seen today. His best game of the season IMO. Reminded me of another brilliant lead the line game he had against Spurs away circa 2010.

4682~~~
And some people still try to claim he's not a top striker.

Figures like that and he's making three great headed clearances out our box in the 84th minute of a three nil win. Special player. We should be very glad we have him.

4683~~~
What's been wrong with his performances this season? He's been at least good all the time, despite having to play in CM half the season.

Does the man never just deserve some unconditional praise? For me, he's been a good player and captain all season and he was excellent today.

4684~~~
He's only three behind Andy Cole now in all-time Premier League goals.

4685~~~
I've been critical of him in the past, but he's easily our best forward. He shall play up front.

4686~~~
I'm glad we're playing him up front again, should take care of all this nonsense about Kane being the best English striker these days <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

Hopefully we'll continue with him up top for the foreseeable future as well. He makes shit happen, and he scores goals. It's basically all you need from your main man up top.

4687~~~
I think today's performance was his probably best of the season, I really like what I saw from him today. Waaay better than any of his recent ones which were bit overrated because he was scoring goals even though his all around play was very average. Still, even those were better than most of van Persie's and Falcao's this season, so there's really no reason to start any of those two ahead of him up front.

4688~~~
A little while in his career I thought he was finished as a lead striker, I really thought his touch pace had left him for good. It's great to see him looking settled and happy again, and I think that coincides with how good his form has been recently. He's definitely relishing playing upfront again, and is making those runs in the channel we have desperately lacked recently. I wish we stuck him upfront months earlier as we would comfortably be in 2nd/3rd place by now!.

4689~~~
A nostalgic aura around that solo goal from Wazza. As Benjamin Franklin once said :

 ‘’ Hide not your talents, they for use were made,What's a sundial in the shade?”

The decision to play Rooney in midfield was only limiting him in his strengths.  246 competition goals ( including Everton) , what makes people think that Rooney lost his edge ? He should be nowhere near a midfield position, perhaps in a later stage of his career. He thrives on his energy and finishing abilities and where best to do that around/in the 16 yard area.

4690~~~
I'm glad to see Rooney regain that sharpness and speed of thought that he used to have when playing up front during the 2009/10 season. I used to think that his best performances nowadays would come with a strike partner, but he's done very well when leading the line in the past few matches. This is the sort of striker we needed for so much of this season, and it's refreshing to see Rooney perform like this. His touches may still be a tad heavy, but he's really improved in controlling the ball in tight spaces, so much so that he's been very good at creating spaces all by himself.

This is a striker who's perfect for van Gaal's system (the ideal one). van Persie and Falcao have shown their potential up front here and there, but Rooney's been the only one who's consistently done it for several matches (since his last time up front against Southampton away when he was quite poor). He has to be our main leading striker from here on in with either van Persie or some attacking midfielder behind him. Either that or him playing with a strike/goalscoring partner.

4691~~~
The title <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4692~~~
Rooney was really good today and honestly has looked sharp for weeks. His mental game seems to have improved quite a bit imo. We have an exciting future if we play him as lone striker imo

4693~~~
His performance today shows why a new striker in the summer shouldn't be anywhere near a priority. Rooney as a lone striker up top in a 4-3-3 can score 30 a season.

4694~~~
Just an opinion. I said he was excellent today, just havn't enjoyed his performances this season in midfield or as a support striker. Been saying it for years but for me he's a number 9 all day long. Looked very dynamic today and was running at players which i havn't seen him do much this season.

4695~~~
Sorry Sir Bobby.....Rooney will get the record next season

4696~~~
Some people think he's best as a striker. Some think he's best in the hole. Some think he's destined to be a midfielder. I think they're all right to some extent. The way you get the most out of Rooney is to play him as a false 9, the way he was against Tottenham.

4697~~~
He's been a 9 for the last 5 years or so, at least. And he's very good at basically everything a 9 has to do. I wish the club thought of him like a Lewandowski or Benzema type. #NoMoreCentralAttackers

4698~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.gyazo.com/a66b207b9fb1fb0e5fad92b7231ae645.png" src="http://i.gyazo.com/a66b207b9fb1fb0e5fad92b7231ae645.png"/>

Dare I say it, watch out Shearer?

4699~~~
Great performance. Great response to that silly video. Spoke really well after the match too I thought. Really impressed with Rooney's attitude this season and is showing that he was right choice for captain. Should have been playing as the striker a lot earlier but glad van Gaal got it right before it is too late. Hopefully RvP doesn't come straight back in because he doesn't deserve it.

4700~~~
All depends on where he'll played in the future. If we keep playing him up top, he has a decent chance of catching Shearer, but he will likely need <i>at least</i> three more seasons as our first choice striker. Not sure I see it.

He should catch both of Charlton's club records, 249 overall and 199 league goals, within two seasons though. He's currently 229 (20 off) and 169 (thirty off). And he's off course just three goals off his England record, so he'll have that within the year.

4701~~~
Am I the only one who thinks it looks more like he slips because hes wearing socks on a hard floor rather than actually being put down by the slap?

4702~~~
Shades of old Rooney with his runs and touch on point. He should stay up top with that form and we should definitely keep playing with one striker. I've always been of the idea that him, RVP, and Falcoa should fight for the position.

I tried to pull a similar pass once to disastrous proportions. Mind you I'm stronger on my right foot but I attempted the pass from the right side of the pitch with my left <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>. I'm obviously a top player in my head <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>.

4703~~~
That goal reminded me of a young Rooney. Great celebration as well!

4704~~~
He needs 4 more 20 goal seasons to pass Shearer

4705~~~
time to make him number 9, permanently.

bring in a couple of top wing forwards next season and just play 4-3-3.

4706~~~
Depay <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4707~~~
His game against Arsenal in the league was as good as this one, imho. Although in terms of the quality of the goal, this is his best.

4708~~~
Couldn't believe he did it. I did a belly dance, celebrating that goal.

4709~~~
Great to see him leading the team the way he is. His goals will drive us to the top 4.

4710~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/XBwOvST.gif" src="http://i.imgur.com/XBwOvST.gif"/>

On other note, good performance today with a goal to show for it.

4711~~~
And Nani <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4712~~~
I think he should try a Fellaini uppercut before the dippers game.

4713~~~
Impressive performance.  Managed to strike a good balance of playing off the last man with dropping deeper to pick up possession.  I think he works well with Fellaini because they rarely look to occupy the same spaces.  I just hope LVG leaves him as the #9 when RVP becomes available.

4714~~~

4715~~~
God I miss Ruud, one of the best goalscorers in the last decade.

Ok fair enough. I personally felt he actually did pretty well in midfield given that it's far from his ideal position. He dominated the Newcastle game from the middle and still found time to score a brace, just for starters! Not many players can put in performances like that when out of position, so it seems a bit harsh to use that period as a reason to be disappointed with him this season.

There tends to be a bit of a trend on here that after a great performance we act as if it's the first one of the whole season. There have been a number of good games from us this year, especially recently - it's been our inability to produce more than one in a row that's cost us. And the same is true of Rooney. This was a good game from him but by no means an unusually good one or necessarily his best this season.

4720~~~
Yep, that was a beaut.

4721~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> 

Only 20 goals behind Sir Bobby as well now, I think someone mentioned? He'll claim the record early next season if he'll stay up front.

4722~~~
Would be great but I would go as far as saying there's next to no chance of that happening. Shearer's record is absolutely incredible.


Superb performance from him yesterday. My man of the match with Carrick.

Having a striker who is making runs in the channels and in behind then having a midfielder (Carrick) who is able to pick those passes out were the main reasons for our dominance. Have got a really good feeling that Rooney is coming into some form at the perfect time.

4723~~~
LVG has realised Falcao is not upto it so has kept him on the bench lets just hope he can keep RVP on the bench too he must be back soon. First time in the season we are actually playing well it shouldn't be changed.

4724~~~

Look at him how happy he is seeing that go in. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4725~~~
I reckon he had his celebration planned and was smiling with delight that he was going to get to do it.

4726~~~
That performance yesterday was as good as you'll see from any #9 in the league. Genuinely. It puts RVP/Falcao's performances this season to shame, to be quite honest. Touch, link up, pace, passing, movement, finishing..it had it all. Once he was through for the goal, was there anyone that <i>didn't</i> think he was going to score? He's showing that, as a striker, he's still one of the best, so just play him there.

 He's also become a fantastic captain to boot. I said the other week he's winning me round again, and yesterday just reinforced that. Dare I say, I'm actually starting to quite like him again.

4727~~~
Very nervous about what happens when Van Persie is back tho.

4728~~~
Hopefully Van Gaal is learning a lot from the recent games, I think he's spending the entire season trying to work out what works and what doesn't.

4729~~~
Yeah hopefully.

4730~~~
I said it several times, Rooney is a goalscorer nothing more, the fact that he is a complete footballer shouldn't let people assume that he is anything else, he is not a #10 not a winger, not a midfielder, he is happy when he plays upfront and he always scores goals.

4731~~~
He's most definitely a #10. Just because he does not play the role according to certain pre-conceived notions does not mean he does not play it very well.

4732~~~
He's not a number, he's a free man.

4733~~~
For him to be a decent No.10 it would be better if we had a decent No. 9, so until we do just play him as the main striker. His celebration was brilliant. Brought a smile to my face as did his and teams performance.

4734~~~
Oh I agree. Just saying that he clearly is a very good #10 as well.

4735~~~
Anyone who has seen me comment on Rooney knows that I'm not his biggest fan, nor will I ever be. However, that being said, he played a great match against Tottenham. He looks slow both in thinking and running when playing in midfield, but put him up top and he looks quite fast, and his passing is less of a let down, actually downright good at times. That outside of the foot pass out wide was sublime.

4736~~~
Not taking anything away from Rooney here, but don't you guys also think that RVP would benefit from having Carrick in the team?

4737~~~
Exactly right. He's one of the best strikers in the game and that's where he should play every week. Even in the media, there has been a reluctance to accept his best position for a number of years, with people trying their best to convince themselves that he's something more, something Paul Scholes. It was never the case and Rooney is proving that now.

4738~~~
Carrick's played 14 times this season. That was the first time (I think?) that RvP didn't get to play in the same team as him. Not once has he produced a performance as good as Rooney's yesterday.

4739~~~
Everyone benefits from having Carrick in the team so yes RVP would benefit. I dont think that should mean RVP should come back into the team. We need to be playing with 1 up front at the moment and Rooney is currently the our best striker so that leaves no room for RVP or Falcao. Its up to LVG though and knowing him he may put RVP straight back into the side and start playing 2 up front again which would completely be the wrong decision IMO.

4740~~~
lrbr2015

4741~~~
I'm not saying that he isn't good or very good in other positions but Rooney is at his best when he plays as a striker.

4742~~~
Great performance yesterday. He's a far better player when he plays in his actual position. His goal yesterday was Rooney at his very best.

4743~~~
3-0 comfortable lead, 80 something minute and who's there in our box having three awesome defensive headers? Yeah, that's right, Falcao.

4744~~~
Rooney's energy, intelligence, and willingness to work in a team even when it's not built around him make him a better fit for the current mix of players. He'll make runs to draw defenders and lay off passes that make it easier for Young and Herrera and Fellaini to a) get the ball to him or b) create a chance/make a pass to someone else.

RVP, at his best, makes the people providing him service look good when he's converting his chances. If he's not finishing precisely (like this year), he doesn't help the rest of the team provide him service.

4745~~~
Not once has Carrick performed at that level this season either. RVP IS very good at making runs in behind the defense. After all, the Carrick-RVP combo was extremely productive during Fergie's last season.

4746~~~
Not disagreeing with this, but two seasons ago, RVP was clearly our best striker. He may or may not have regressed a lot since then though. This season, he has certainly been underwhelming, as has Rooney, but not in his proper position.

4747~~~
Must Watch!

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JRZ38jytQdg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

4748~~~
Rooney hasn't had an underwhelming season, RvP has.

4749~~~
Cringe-inducing and not funny in the slightest.

4750~~~
That's not true at all. You shouldn't even have to think very hard to come up with a similar performance. How about the away game against the same opposition? The game where RvP made a mess of a brilliant chance served up to him by, you guessed it, Michael Carrick.

Carrick had a run of good games when he first came back from injury. RvP was mainly meh throughout. You'd have to be seriously biased to think Rooney's performance yesterday was primarily down to a once in a season performance from Carrick.

4751~~~
Not taking anything away from Rooney I believe I said. My memory may well serve me wrong regarding Carrick though. Rooney has been good and there is no bias suggesting anything else. I don't think he is world class, but at his best he is a valuable player.

4752~~~
I think both have been poor. Rooney obviously has the excuse of having to play in midfield where he loses the ball far too much. As a striker he has been better than rvp has shown this season.

4753~~~
Laborious van Persie is finished. He may do better in a line-up like we had this week, but his dynamism has declined severely and is currently a few levels below Rooney.

4754~~~
That picture of him smiling is actually from Carrick's goal, I believe.

Just wanted to put that, great stuff. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4758~~~
He is in great scoring form but we all knew he'd score loads up front, except LVG for some reason.  

He's an emotional player so he'll be fired up against Liverpool and in his current form he could be the cause of us winning.

<b><span style="font-size: 15px">Wayne Rooney was acting and not boxing with Phil Bardsley says Jamie Moore</span></b>

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://img.skysports.com/14/09/496x259/jamie-moore-boxing_3201616.jpg" src="http://img.skysports.com/14/09/496x259/jamie-moore-boxing_3201616.jpg"/>

<span style="font-size: 15px">Wayne Rooney's boxing video was play-acting and the England captain wasn't injured, says boxing trainer Jamie Moore.

A clip of Rooney taking a tumble after boxing in his kitchen with friend and Stoke player Phil Bardsley caused a storm at the weekend - leading to his memorable goal celebration in <a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/313673/report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United's 3-0 win over Tottenham</a>.

But Moore, the Manchester-based former fighter and trainer of Tommy Coyle, insists he has been told the video clip wasn't as brutal as it seems.

He told <i>Sky Sports</i>: "I’m well-informed that, straight after the video clip ended, Rooney jumps up and he’s fine. They were just having a bit of craic, let’s just say it was a well-edited video.

"I think Rooney has been having acting lessons more than boxing lessons – for a start, why didn’t he parry Bardsley’s jab?"

Moore's claim echoes Bardsley's wife Tanya's claim on her Twitter account that the friends were playing and not fighting.

Manchester United supporter Moore continued: "I’ve known Phil Bardsley for years through Steve Foster Snr. I remember when he was 16 as a young apprentice at United he would come and train at Oliver’s with us. He’s always been around the boxing.

"He comes down to my gym to stay in shape during the football pre-season. So he knows what he’s doing boxing-wise! He’s been around the game his whole life.

"After the way Rooney played on the day that video was released, I’m hoping for Rooney v Bardsley II!"</span>

4760~~~
Called it (not that there was any doubt)

Good stuff from Rooney. The "They say he's a Legend" advert was class as well.

4761~~~
He's one of the best actors in the world, even though the haters will never admit it.

4762~~~
That advert has to be my favourite of all time

4763~~~
With Patrice in there as well! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> So good!

4764~~~
Hope he does another motivational speech on Saturday night... though perhaps "It doesn't f*in slip" will suffice?

4765~~~
When's RvP back? Interesting to see what will happen. I'd imagine RVP will be brought back into the starting 11, so will Rooney be moved back? 

I'd like to see RvP in behind Rooney.

4766~~~
He's been good since he played up top, but he's massively helped by Fellaini's presence playing high on the pitch. But I'm worried for Sunday because he's ususally very very bad at Anfield, and I can't remember a good performance from him there. 

If our captain, what is supposed to be our best (with De Gea) player is not good enough for this clash, it's going to be a difficult game for us. 

And Pool improved massively behind with their back 3, so I guess that it would be difficult for him also there.

4767~~~
I can't remember the last time I saw a player play as badly for Man United as Rooney has in this first half - to say he's been playing like a pub player would be to flatter him. He looks drunk/hungover.

4768~~~
It's crazy how inconsistent he can be. World class one game, pub team player the next.

4769~~~
Been brutal this half.

4770~~~
Is he drunk? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> He was embarassing himself in this first half.

4771~~~
That was as bad as his performance against Swansea a couple of seasons ago.

4772~~~
Pretty standard Anfield performance for him.

4773~~~
He can't seem to control the ball.

4774~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> why does he always stink the place up when we play in Liverpool.

4775~~~
And we're playing well in spite of him. He was really good last week but jesus what was that? Can't even do the basics right.

4776~~~
Typical Goodison/Anfield performance. I'd take him off if he doesn't improve by the 60th minute. He's just never going to have a good game here.

4777~~~
Yeah, Goodison too. Maybe too many old memories flow through the brain.

4778~~~
A bit hit and miss so far. If we are to come out with 3 points we need him to score. Needs to come out and lead us in the second half. Mata and Herrera surely cant sustain this type of pressing for 90 minutes can they?

4779~~~
If he can get his game together second half there's another goal in this for us.

4780~~~
Horrible match, fecks up the easiest touches and passes.

4781~~~
Standard performance in his home town.

4782~~~
You must have a very, very short memory...

4783~~~
It's not really horrible match. 3 (I think) poor passes, but other things are going well.

4784~~~
He has actually had a couple of decent moments but mostly been sloppy

Not sure he deserves anything close to the stick he has received

4785~~~
Struggling to get into the game at the moment, it's not sticking when it gets to him, not sure what those suggesting taking him off are on though, who would we put on to play up top?

4786~~~
He will wake up in the second half.

4787~~~
It was over ten years ago since he last scored at anfield. Must be some sort of mental block.

4788~~~
Some huge overreactions in here, and the worst thing is that it comes at a time when we are leading our biggest rivals away from home!

4789~~~
3 passes that have led to them counter attacking. And simple lay offs too.

He also seems to be half arsed with his pressing of them. And being offside, when he shouldn't.

4790~~~
He's under the spotlight today because everyone else has been so good. Hoping for a massive improvement in the next 45.

4791~~~
Anyone is better than what we saw from him in first half.

4792~~~
This.

It would not be so bad if he could at least get the basics right.

4793~~~
His form scale is ridiculously wide. He's one of the best in the world on his game, but off it he becomes a ket head trying to dribble a lead balloon through a bog.

4794~~~
It's a Falcao esq performance. He was getting absolutely slaughtered for it. Luckily Rooney has time to improve today.

4795~~~
Shit on the ball today but he offers more off it in comparison to the possible replacements. The run in behind is massive for us and he's pressing well.

4796~~~
Been so poor today but if he picks it up we will start clicking really well. 

Just like at Barca, when the false 9 isn't playing well the team isn't playing well. We don't really have another option on the bench tho

4797~~~
Woeful.

4798~~~
This has been the main issue. He's done it when we are transitioning and trying to get men higher up and Liverpool have men left up the pitch.

I think their one good chance was when Rooney misplaced his pass and Blind had gone motoring up the pitch. It wouldn't be so bad if he'd do it when we had been camped up in their half with lots of men back behind the ball.

4799~~~
We're counting on you after the game!

4800~~~
Wank today. Real disappointing considering the occasion.

4801~~~
this. please wake up wayne

4802~~~
It's bizzare! He can be in great form before it and go back to great form after it but it's like the self pity city is his kryptonite!

4803~~~
Anfield Curse <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4804~~~
Seriously bad game.

4805~~~
He was fecking awful today. We won in spite of him, not because of him. Absolute gash. What a shockingly shit penalty.

4806~~~
Terrible game,Terrible penalty, 3 points.

4807~~~
It was 10 vs 10.

4808~~~
Comfortably our worst player today, and that penalty miss was just a winnit on the smelly arse of his performance.

But before people pile on, let's remember that our uptick in form has coincided with Rooney going back up front, and we've produced our best performances of the season with him there.

Never good at Anfield, and there's a case for simply leaving him out in this fixture, but let's just move on, because we got the 3 points, and i'm sure he'll be back scoring goals in the upcoming games.

4809~~~
Bit of a knob to not let Mata take the penalty to be honest.

4810~~~
Pretty sure Mata returning to the side has had something to do with these 2 massive results too. Can't believe how shit Rooney can be in merseyside. Really don't get it.

4811~~~
He is always shit away at Liverpool or Everton. Just something we have to live with.

4812~~~
The Mata and Herrera link-up has played a big part as well, I agree. But having a forward who will run in behind, chase, harry, and generally be a bit of a nuisance even when he's not on top form also has.

We seem to have stumbled onto a set-up that works, and apparently it doesn't include RvP, Falcao or Di Maria (our three best players on paper, some might say).

4813~~~
I'd say Di Maria can play a massive part, just has to be a bit safer with his passing and style sometimes to prevent so many turnovers. He can obviously pick a killer pass and it looks brilliant when it comes off.

4814~~~
Typical piss poor showing away to Liverpool. I honestly don't understand how he can be this consistently crap against them (and Everton away).

4815~~~
Very poor today, but it was predicted. Nothing to see here though, and I expect him to continue his fine form in the coming weeks. 

Just as he is typically bad against Liverpool away, he is typically very good against City, and I expect hi, to be so again in a few weeks.

4816~~~
To say he wasn't at his best today would be kind... fortunately, he didn't have to be.

Wish Mata had took that pen!

4817~~~
He was shit.

4818~~~
I was really disappointed in him taking the penalty. Should have been Mata. Thought our captain should have stepped aside, even with his shoddy pen record.

4819~~~
He was wank, as he usually is vs the scouser teams, but the most annoying thing was that he didn't let Mata take the penalty.

4820~~~
Always shit against Liverpool, had a feeling he'd miss that penalty.

4821~~~
Very disappointing. Not just because of the wank performance and missed penalty, but not a lot of leadership from him when we were a bit wobbly after the gerrard sending off. I know its probably nitpicking but should have had a word with Jones for his rash challenge and probably ADM for being wasteful.

4822~~~
Was bad but, taking the penalty was the right thing even though he missed.  Still provides so much more than RVP/Falcao with his energy.

4823~~~
One to forget for Rooney.

4824~~~
I thought it was a good penalty, but just an awesome save from Minge.

4825~~~
He was rotten today. If we had a center forward who had bothered to turn up I reckon we could've really embarrassed them.

4826~~~
Not bothered about him taking the pen, he is the designated taker after all. Had a feeling he'd miss though. His penalties are hit or miss, like his performances.

4827~~~
Terrible today, I'm annoyed he didn't let mata go for the hattrick too.

4828~~~
Even I didn't expect Rooney to score. Glad him missing didn't affect the result though. He usually takes 3-4 good penalties in a row after missing so hopefully he scores when they matter. Anyway, no qualms with him taking it over Mata, you don't change your designated taker so someone can complete their hattrick unless you're comfortably winning.

4829~~~
He wasn't terrible at all. I'd much rather have had him than RvP or Falcao.

4830~~~
haha so true.

4831~~~
He was crap. Has he ever had a good game against the scousers? The only one I rememeber was that goal goal against Everton in '07 but in general he forgets he's a footballer in these games. Worst game of the season.

4832~~~
never ever seen a penalty which was good and which goalie saved. That's nonsense like Rooney's contribution to the game. Play him up front they said! If we had a pacy striker we would have won that 4:0

4833~~~
If ADM knew how to pass, we'd have been 3-0 before they ever scored.

4834~~~
Yes of course that's a given, I arent a fan of either of those players he's definately better than those but in this particular game he didn't offer much at all and he really should've let mata have the pen but never mind we won so it's alright.

4835~~~
Well, guess today's the first one for you!

4836~~~
You can turn that around any way you want it though. If Gerrard never lost the plot, if Rooney had a good game etc...

4837~~~
Come on, you can't knock him for taking the penalty to be fair, every single United fan wanted Mata to take the PK (me included), sometimes it happens sometimes it doesn't,a designated PK taker is supposed to take the kick regardless of the outcome of the game and/or his performance in that game, he has done it to RVP, Lampard has done it to Drogba, Messi does it a lot in Barca, Ronaldo in Madrid - it always happens in football.

He was terrible today though, would have come off if Herrera wasn't on a yellow.

4838~~~
Don't know why people are on his case for taking the penalty instead of Mata. He's our penalty taker at the moment and you don't step aside just so someone can have a hatrick.
Agree with the crap performance sentiments though.

4839~~~
It wasn't a good kick...was it?

4840~~~
also true, the guy can't make 5yard pass, I know it's all about confidence but Nani wouldn't be more wasteful. Big stars disappointed today..

With all this criticism I don't want to sound negative. I think it's a fantastic win today and well deserved, anyway we were lucky that Ballo wasn't send off I guess we will have underestimated them even more ..

4841~~~
Dunno if he's happy about it, or van Gaal, but looked fine to me. As said, think Mignolet was fabulous there unfortunately.

4842~~~
With all respect I guess not.

4843~~~
He read it well, what way did Rooney go on his last penalty? I sometimes would like a player to just smash it down the middle. Lampard used to be brilliant at it.

4844~~~
Wasn't great today (typical Anfield performance) but I have to say the penalty was an excellent save from Mignolet.

4845~~~
I know, I was just teasing, we don't have all the same opinions, and that's a great thing. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4846~~~
common. goodison and anfield has never been his hunting ground.

4847~~~
Last three (this one included) all on the same side, left. Superior ones last two though, might be because there was no save. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4848~~~
This shit again, we have this debate on here every time a player is on a hatrick and we get a penalty... What happens in 99% of cases? The designated taker takes the pen, because there's a reason we have designated penalty takers and the game was far from won.

4849~~~
yeah, I agree but in addition to that I am off the same opinion of Roy Makaay or whoever said this that Penalty can't be caught but only badly kicked which was the case today, hope rooney kicks on, cheers

4850~~~
The Sunderland one was low wasn't it? Hmm, probably go to the keepers left next time then.

4851~~~
Rooney is shit at penalties and shit at Anfield, Mata IIRC was a designated taker at Chelsea and was on a hat trick.

4852~~~
He was very poor for the first 37 odd minutes but then improved somewhat but still a poor performance. However, it's nothing unexpected from him at Anfield. Important thing is that we won at Anfield, hope he's back to his best vs Villa and City.

4853~~~
Awful awful game from him.

4854~~~
You don't change your designated taker for a hat trick unless the game is safe already. I remember Ronaldo not giving Tevez a penalty (who is better at it than Mata is) to complete his hattrick as well.

4855~~~
Rooney shouldn't be our taker IMO either.

4856~~~
He was carried through the game today but I won't lay in to him too much, he's been brilliant for us so far this season and he just can't get going against pool at anfield, I am really annoyed though Mata did't take that penalty

4857~~~
Rooney isn't our first choice taker. It's RvP

4858~~~
What's Mata's pen record like? I remember him missing in the CL final and Lampard was Chelsea's taker.

4859~~~
Wayne Rooney is a brilliant player, but him playing poorly at Anfield is just one of the constants in the universe. 

He'll torment Villa next weekend.

4860~~~
True, had a quick google doesn't seem great tbh.

4861~~~
So in the middle of the match at Anfield the players should have a debate on the relative merits of each player from the penalty spot and strip Rooney of his designated duties? If Rooney is not good enough then Van Gaal needs to change his designated taker, not expect Rooney to hand out the task to any player who fancies it during an important game.

Also Lampard.

4862~~~
Rooney isn't great at them but with RvP out, he's our best penalty taker so it's right that he took it.

4863~~~
He should have given the penalty to Mata. A hatrick away to the Scouse on their doorstep is the dream. Especially as Mata is such an accomplished pen taker (and Rooney isn't) and the fact there was 1-2 min left to play! It was selfish from Rooney.

4864~~~
Rooney went to his favourite side but didn't quite get it in the corner this time.

Could tell after five minutes he was going to have a stinker.

4865~~~
Horribly subpar performance.

Anyone notice how LVG moved him back into midfield after Falcao came on?

Hope he picks up his form the next game.

4866~~~
There doesn't need to be a debate, he could have given the ball to Mata, I think I'm mostly annoyed because I had no confidence in him scoring. In the end it made and makes little difference I suppose.

4867~~~
It always feels like he's struggling away to both teams in Liverpool so this perfomance was hardly surprising. Hope he gets back to his Tottenham form next match.

4868~~~
Putting the penalty to one side for a moment, he was absolutely dreadful today. I'd definitely persist with him as the lone striker in a 4-3-3 for the remainder of the season though.

4869~~~
Thought it was to protect Herrera who was on a Yellow, no natural midfielder to come off the bench at the moment with Blind at LB.

4870~~~
Koke in the CL last week is the best I can think of.

4871~~~
Mata scored just one penalty goal in his England career. Could be 1 in 1 though, not sure.

4872~~~
This is the kind of shit this thread attracts. As shit a post as Rooney's performance today.

4873~~~
I guess so, we didn't have many midfield options on the bench to be fair.

4874~~~
It was a bit of a mix for me. It was undoubtedly a very good save, but Rooney's penalty was one you'd expect any decent goalkeeper who managed to guess the right way to make. Fairly poor penalty as well as being a good save.

4875~~~
He was shocking today but he always has one of those now and then and it was bound to come at Anfeild. He should still keep his place over RVP and Falcao unless he plays like that again the next game.

4876~~~
I'd agree with this. If he has another bad game or two, <i>then </i>I'd consider dropping him, but for now we should definitely persist with him up front because until today, he's generally offered a lot more in his striker role than RVP or Falcao have.

4877~~~
He was absolutely awful, but his attitude was terrific. The amount of times he put the Liverpool defense under pressure was great to see. Other than that, he got everything else wrong.

4878~~~
An accomplished pen taker? He has scored 4 in game penalties in his career compared to Rooney's 24. What are you basing this accomplished penalty taking skill on? Hes hardly ever taken any.

4879~~~
I know people keep saying oh it's Rooneys usual shit performance at Anfield and we should accept it.

But he needs to step up in games like this. He's our captain. Shocking he hasn't scored there for 10 years.

4880~~~
We never do tha,  I remember Ruud wanting to give a penalty to Forlan who hadn't scored in a while and Fergie didn't allow it. Same happened once when Tevez was on a hattrick and Ronaldo still took.the penalty as he's our designated penalty taker. I don't blame Rooney for this, there's no room for sentiment in football, he missed shit happens.

4881~~~
Poo penalty, but good save.

4882~~~
One thing I will say in Rooneys defence is - who else could we have played who would have done better? 

I don't think RVP or Falcao would have done anything at all today. Rooney has formed an effective partnership of sorts with a Fellaini, and his energy and pressing helped us control the game. He may have missed the penalty and it certainly wasn't his best performance, but in my opinion Rooney contributed decently to the overall performance and result.

4883~~~
I agree. 

I mean, I don't think Rooney should take our penalties since I don't really trust him with them - but when he is the designated taker then he obviously have to take them. No gifts.

4884~~~
It was the exact height that keepers love. If lower he probably scores. Rooney was good today because his hold up play with Fellaini was good.

4885~~~
Will have to look at it again, I thought it was a great save but seems like I need another look.

4886~~~
Absolutely atrocious today. If that had been a RVP performance, people would be fuming and saying he is way past it. He looked slow, cumbersome, couldn't control a ball at all and his passing was completely shit. His penalty was the icing on the awful cake he had made himself. Good against Tottenham, shit today.

4887~~~
It was a terrible penalty - if a goalie goes the right way he has to save it.

4888~~~
I wouldn't blame him for not giving penalty Mata to take it, I am not sure van Gaal would allow it. 

However, I blame him for the penalty itself, it was typical Rooney penalty of three or four seasons ago when he missed them regulary because he made it too easy for keepers with the height. They only needed to guess the side and they would usually save it, same as today.

4889~~~
His performance sure backed up that article about his short comings at Anfield. Its just one off those things I guess because he's been good since leading the line again.

4890~~~
he really misjudged it. Probably the hype before the game, but you can see that it's so obvious the goalkeeper is going to go to his right. You can see how pissed Rooney is. He wasn't great today, but bloody hell does he try and work like most other players don't. He never gives in.

4891~~~
RVP probably, I didn't think Rooney was that poor, but it's obvious he should play with someone in front of him. The penalty was well saved, but it was way too obvious he was aiming for the left corner.

4892~~~
He might have recognized that Mata was burying his chances while he was having an off game. Don't give it to Mata for the hat trick, but because he has a very high confidence and an excellent chance of scoring.

4893~~~
The penalty was the worst thing he did all game I felt.

Don't think RVP would have been any use though (and I still rate him) - we needed some energy and pressing up front today, and again it would be unwise to break up the Fellaini/Rooney partnership in my opinion.

4894~~~
Knocked his score down to a 6 after the penalty save, too easy for Mignolet that. His penalty record is poor, maybe Falcao should've taken it.

4895~~~
Generous!

4896~~~
You really thought he was that bad?

4897~~~
First half woeful, much better 2nd half until poor penalty.

4898~~~
The thing is, he's actually been quite consistent from the spot in the last few years (I may be wrong of course, so please feel free to disprove that.) I wanted Mata to take it because I love the Spanish teddy bear, but Rooney is the designated taker, and was also badly in need of a goal at Anfield. I thought he was pretty bad today, but I don't really hold the penalty against him.

4899~~~
I thought it was his worst game for quite some time!

Pretty much everyone had a good game apart from him, from what I saw.

Opinions!

4900~~~
Very, very poor today. Only plays because we have an injured striker and another one who is woefully out of form.

4901~~~
such a shame he missed the pen, as it'd have been the perfect way to end that drought.

Not to mention let the rest of us get our heart rates down after almost giving them a chance in a game they were never in!

4902~~~
He definitely has, but I always feel that he has a miss in him. However, today the miss meant nothing.

4903~~~
I was surprised Mata didn't take the pen.

Not really Rooney's day, but Mata and Herrera made up for that.

4904~~~
Crap penalty capped off a pretty crap game all over really. 

Ah well, we still won.

4905~~~
You're suggesting he wouldn't play if RVP were healthy and/or Falcao were in better form? Today apart, Rooney has been excellent when played in his proper position.

4906~~~
He was correct to take the penalty, he is our penalty taker and it wasn't as though we were winning 5-0. But he shouldn't be our penalty taker. I think I read somewhere his conversion rate is less than 70%, which is appalling. I don't know who else could take them though. 

As for today, he was crap, but still worked hard. Encouraging we can play that well at Anfield with such an important player having a stinker.

4907~~~
True, but it's been a while since we had a penalty who I didn't feel that way about (perhaps Ruud, but even he went through a cold spell, at the beginning of the 2003-4 season, I believe.)

4908~~~
I was always confident about Ronaldo. He missed two high profile penalties, but he also scored a bunch of high pressure ones. Other than him it probably goes back to Cantona?

4909~~~
RvP has been slaughtered for performances better than Rooney's today. The difference is of course the victory, and the way the whole team plays. But the way the team finally manages to play in the weeks RvP is injured, would suit him certainly more than Fellaini, and it could well do with more technical players in general, because a lot of them don't really have the technique to play one touch. They try and they manage to get the ball quite near where it should be, but it's not solid. But maybe it's not wise to change it immediately, the ambition should be to get more technical players in and relie less on Fellaini's headers. Also steady partnerships aren't that important under Van Gaal as under most managers. 

What's his conversion rate? These days often strikers and creative players take the penalties, because of their goal scoring stats, but often miss half of them. I always prefer those midfielders or defenders of the hard working nothing special type who normally don't score but just know how to convert a penalty. The ref has blown his whistle, and we can already count the goal.

4910~~~
I'd be interested in a source for this too - Penalty stats are always a nightmare to look up.

4911~~~
Wasn't great today. Never is against Liverpool, to be fair. Lost the ball sloppily in the first half and failed to hold it up. Felt he improved in the second half, though.

4912~~~
Unfortunately it would appear that if RVP is not playing then Rooney will continue to take the penalties. Because he's captain I suppose it does give him that opportunity to pull rank.

4913~~~
The difference (between Rooney today and RVP) is the overall contribution to the game. Rooney works harder, defends more, presses more etc than RVP. RVP is very much one of those where if he doesn't score or assist, he likely does nothing. Rooney can still have a good game without getting on the scoresheet (not saying today was a GOOD game from him mind you).
Your comments about Fellaini are bizarre at beat given he has been one of our best players in the last two games. He is arguably the biggest beneficiary of our current formation and style of play. Based on your post it sounds like you are one of those in the "If Fellaini is on the pitch then it must be hoofball" camp. My thoughts on that are well documented in the Fellaini thread.

Your argument then basically is that Rooney behind RVP would have been more effective for us today than Fellaini playing off Rooney. I disagree entirely, as Rooney has shown in recent weeks that he offers a lot more as a #9 than RVP/Falcao, and Fellaini has been one of our best players recently.

4914~~~
Agreed. Mignolet has got across well, but it's at perfect height for saving. If you ask a goalkeeper where they'd want a penalty to be put, they'd probably say exactly where Rooney put it. Normally Rooney goes low and hard and puts it right into the side netting, but it was a really poor take.

Low and hard, or towards the top corner. Never in between.


Think he did okay today. His hold up play against Skrtel was decent, but his lay offs were sloppy in the first half. That improved a lot in the 2nd half but I think he struggled not having someone playing close to him when holding it up, as Fellaini was in the channel and Mata was out wide. His runs in behind were poorly timed and he needlessly strayed offside a few times. He could have papered over that if he scored that penalty. Shame. Overall I think 2-1 flattered Liverpool.

4915~~~
I don't know, I always felt a bit nervous with Ronaldo from the spot; I'd say I have about the same confidence in Rooney that I did in Ronaldo. Neither of them a patch on the likes of Gerrard, Lampard or Balotelli when it comes to the inevitability of scoring from the spot.

4916~~~
Boots on the wrong feet today, the kit man must ensure that Rooney knows which is his right boot and which is his left. Maybe the manufacturers could help him with some nice logos.

4917~~~
As a striker, sorry.

He had a good game against Spuds, but was pretty average against Arsenal and Newcastle before as well.

4918~~~
Just had another look at the penalty, shit effort.

4919~~~
The penalty itself was fine, the problem is Rooney's walk. If you angle your walk so much you got no chance to shoot in the other corner unless you completely bend your body. Its incredibly easy for a goalkeeper to chose a corner if you take it like this.

4920~~~
Shh, don't say that around here, they'll say you have an agenda. Today's performance was the exact thing RVP was getting slaughtered for, and at worst he can usually hold the ball up against a centre back. Rooney struggled with the basics today. Spurs was easily his best performance of 2015, but you would think he was showing world class performances week in week out the way some speak. We might be playing better but I don't think it's mainly down to the striker being Rooney, considering we won in spite of him today.

4921~~~
Don't see him scoring at Anfield again tbh, he's lost when he plays there. Good thing the penalty miss didn't bite us in the arse though.

4922~~~
It was terrible, absolutely perfect position for the keeper, just like Agueros in the week.

4923~~~
No, actually I think a lot of tall player's technique is underestimated because they don't move smooth and elegant, while their control of the ball is fine. I rated Fellaini as quite a good allround midfielder years ago. Nontheless, technically RvP is among the best in the world, and Fellaini isn't. 

A lot has been changing over the last few weeks, throughout the whole team players have this click, think quicker, decide quicker, play quicker, start their runs earlier. That's the type of game that suits Van Persie much better than this slow posession game from the last few months where he has to shield the ball or walk back with it because there's no one to play it to with one or two touches.

4924~~~
Nothing new, always has a stinker at Anfield. Held the ball up well though and made good runs and worked hard so it's still good when you compare it to the striker "performances" that RvP/Falcao have given this season. His pens are the same as usual really, he always hits it at that height just this time Mignolet guessed right. We shouldn't change anything regardless of players coming back.

4925~~~
Rooney, why didn't you let Mata get a hatrick you moron?

Rooney was awful today, but he is still a brilliant player. He is going to be perfect foil for Ronaldo next season <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4926~~~
No it isn't good at all. Sorry but how is having an absolute stinker of a game good? Using it even more against RVP who has put in some decent performances this season, Falcao fair enough but sorry he played a bit rubbish today which is a shame considering he looked like he was working his way into some really good form.

4927~~~
I mean like it's still better for the team then the average RvP game this season, he worked hard, closed down constantly and fought with Skrtel all game. His passing was way off and he should have scored but his movement was fine and he made those unselfish runs down the flanks to drag defenders out that was a huge problem with the other 2 strikers which they never did. Obviously for his standards it was shite, but it was for his standards also a normal Anfield performance. Always has a below par game there for whatever reason. 

Don't think this will affect his confidence in any way though as we did win the game.

4928~~~
The average RVP game also came in a run where he was partnering a past it Falcao and we played like shit for ages. I don't see how RVP couldn't have done any worse today than what Rooney offered. I'm just wondering if we will see the pair of Rooney and RVP together once he's fit again. Kind of warming to Fellaini playing in the first XI.

4929~~~
Yeah true. And I said a few weeks ago that I'd be interested in seeing Van Persie as a 10 behind Rooney in a 4-4-2 against Villa to try it, he has the extra bit of technique and quality on the ball in tight spaces that perhaps Rooney lacks while Rooney can stretch defences with his physicality and extra pace. Rooney behind RvP never worked, could work the other way around. But the way we're playing now with these players in the 4-3-3, we really shouldn't mess with it in the big games. If someone loses form then we can change, but two games in a row where the whole team performed well (for the most part).

4930~~~
With his woeful first touch and inconsistent short passing, surely it's better that  Rooney is the furthest forward so he does not disrupt the creative balance of the team.

4931~~~
Very poor today compared to last week, but i can't for the life of me remember a good Rooney game in the city of Liverpool. Hes always shite at both Anfield and Goodison.

4932~~~
Yep, think we would have struggled today had he been playing deeper. Least furthest forward his poor game today didn't effect the performance of our midfield who all played very well.

4933~~~
Usual Rooney performance at Anfield.

Rubbish.

4934~~~
Thought he was poor in the first half, never really got going in the second either but his hold up play was better.

4935~~~
He was a bit shit today. Shame because the midfield was genuinely excellent today. Hope he gets back on track next game. We need one of iur big name strikers to go in a run.

4936~~~

4937~~~
Really poor today but that hopefully fires him on for the next game. Also, his penalty was poor

4938~~~
His penalty wasn't that bad, it was a decent save from Mignolet.

4939~~~
You won't hear 'agenda' from me (I hate that expression - why would anybody other than a player's agent/family or the player himself have an agenda regarding the performance of said player?) I'm also not the biggest Rooney fan, but I feel he's our best striker at the moment (damning with faint praise, mind you.) I feel RVP has become too lethargic, and Falcao too bereft of confidence. Rooney has always had games like today in him (frustratingly they usually seem to happen against Liverpool or Everton,) but history suggests that he'll bounce back with a strong effort or two in the coming weeks.

4940~~~
Should be taken off penalties.
18 out of 26 is shite

4941~~~
Doesn't Falcao have a great penalty record? Why isn't he taking them over Rooney?

4942~~~
Just his usual Anfield performance, so not too worried. He'll be fine the next game.

4943~~~
Bad game but how can anyone argue that RVP or Falcao should be playing.  Besides his goals we are simply a better team with him as striker.  It's so obvious. That debate is over. We look a proper team now. Can't change it now.

4944~~~
As long as he has a good game against Villa and City now, all will be forgiven. 

he started the game like he was hungover and ended it with a horrible penalty. It was delivered that he was going to put it in that side imo. Saying that, he finds the corner like he did last penalty and its 3-1. Just the execution wasnt great at all. Keeper dives the wrong way and we dont care either.

He needs to up his performance though. Our first 35 minutes were great, but in that period id love to see how many times he actually touched the ball.

4945~~~
Totally agree. Is 18 out of 26 just in the league? I'm sure I remember the last time he missed one in the cup against West Ham they said it was his 10th missed penalty for Utd. So it would be his 11th today.

He shouldn't be taking them any more, he's not reliable enough. We've been incredibly lucky though in that I think we've gotten away with it every time he's missed one. We should act now before his crappy penalty taking technique really costs us.

4946~~~
Agreed.  We need to look for someone who can improve on what he brings us up front in the summer, but he is the best option for us until we buy someone better.

4947~~~
With no Robin van Persie on the field, Rooney should continue.

4948~~~
Rooney's missed penalties:

Dec 2004 - Crystal Palace (H)
Oct 2007 - Aston Villa (A)
Mar 2010 - Liverpool (H)
Dec 2010 - Arsenal (H)
Sep 2011 - Chelsea (H)
Jan 2012 - Man City (A)
Jan 2012 - Bolton (H)
Nov 2012 - Arsenal (H)
Jan 2013 - West Ham (H)

Any more between Jan 2013 - Mar 2015?

EDIT: 25 scored? So, if no more than yesterday's in that period between J13-M15, he's on 25/35. Five in last six tries. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

4949~~~
I genuinely don't think he was as bad as is being made out.

Things weren't working out for him, but his movement, mobility and hold up play were still very important to how the team as a whole played.

4950~~~
*Should have <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

4951~~~
Pretty poor yesterday and his peno was a gift for Mignolet.

4952~~~
He was pretty crap. Really really poor in the first half (when everyone else was on fire) but, to be fair, picked it up in the second half. Still, not a good performance overall.

His Liverpool/Everton hoodoo is weird. His goal=scoring record in big games is second to none, so you can't accuse him of being mentally weak. Yet somehow his home town is his kryptonite....

4953~~~
Agree with most on here. That he was poor yesterday. The thing he does do well even when playing badly is occupy defenders, take up good positions and put himself about a bit. Which he did. But he was hardly involved in the game at all, which was a shame considering the performance

4954~~~
I wanted either Mata or Falcao to take it. Never feel confident with Rooney on pens.

4955~~~
Imagine the backlash if Rooney did what Gerrard did. Dropped from the side, comes on in the derby sent off after 45 seconds. He'd be slated! Gerrard getting away with it a bit in my opinion.

4956~~~
Not great at all yesterday, Goodison and Anfield are his kryptonite. Better towards the end in midfield I thought. Not a good performance, but not to the extent I'm seeing by some on here ('worst performance by a Utd player' or whatever). He'll be back to his best next week. 

As for the pen, he's admitted he regretted not letting Mata take it, but even so, I don't think there's much wrong with it. You have designated pen takers, if he'd let Mata take it and he'd missed, he'd be blasted for it as well. But I agree that it would have been a nice gesture, esp. if Mata had got an Anfield hat trick.

4957~~~
He was awful yesterday. Should have let Mata take the penalty to get his hattrick.

4958~~~
9 times out of 10 he shoots in the left corner. He didnt shoot well this time and the GK saved it. Thats the risk, i thought he should have just smashed it through the middle, but i saw it coming. 

Penalty aside. his performance was atrocious. Probably our worst player on the pitch. He wasnt even defensively on top of his game, just thought he looked a bit uninterested yesterday, which is a bit weird considering we played Liverpool. His pressing was ok, but against Spurs he pressed faster, this time he jogged.

4959~~~
Agreed. In such moments it's best to just smash it under the bar in the middle. It's easy to say he should have given it to Mata in hindsight though. He was the captain and it was to finish off the game.

4960~~~
I didnt think he was as bad as a lot of people are making out. Not among our better players on the day, not one of his best or most influential performances, but not the liability some are making out. And he was totally justified taking the penalty, even if he didnt take it well. No need to dwell on this, he's been fantastic in recent games and Im sure will be back to his best against Villa.

4961~~~
So the united fan in the kop was just someone being creative with the photoshop. I was wondering how anyone can be that daft.

4962~~~
I thought Rooney saw him at the game.

4963~~~
He wasn't good, by far our worst perfomer, yet he kept on trying, bullying Skrtel and their defence and didn't completely sulk down.

4964~~~
He really wasn't that bad, and he would have had a certain goal if Di Maria could just complete a simple short pass to him without fecking up on that counter.

4965~~~
If anything, it's kind of refreshing that we don't need our striker to be having a good game to - a) put in a good team performance and b) score goals... we've been so reliant on our strikers in recent years.

4966~~~
We do need them to work as hard as Rooney did yesterday, mind you. Crap and all as he was on the ball he ran the channels and dragged their central defenders out of position. I don't think either of our goals would have happened with RvP or Falcao playing instead of him.

4967~~~
I wonder how Rooney is going to fit in next season? Is he good enough to play the lone striker role, even when you consider the other strikers on the market we might try and buy? I mean he's our best striker right now, but he has his limitations in a lone striker role. I certainly dont want to see him back in midfield either, at least not in this 4-1-4-1 style formation we've been playing.

4968~~~
Haven't we been playing 433? I think he'd be good all across the front three. He's always tended to drift left when playing up top anyway. Seems to like to attack from that area of the pitch.

4969~~~
I wouldnt say so. Like all these things it depends on how it unfolds in real time, and from game to game the formation could end up very different in the end. Our team starts with a flat 4 in the middle though, with Young and Mata out on the wing. Obviously Mata drifted a lot and the formations are a bit academic once the game is in motion. Young was certainly playing as a winger though.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/81831000/jpg/_81831820_manutd'sstartingxivsliverpool.jpg" src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/81831000/jpg/_81831820_manutd'sstartingxivsliverpool.jpg"/> 

That formation above was how I saw the game.

4970~~~
It's 4-3-3 in attack but 4-1-4-1 when we defend. At least that's what LvG said.

4971~~~
Potatoes, po-tah-toes. I saw Hererra, Fellaini and Carrick playing as central midfielders, with Rooney, Mata and Young ahead of them.

Like you say, though, formations are only fixed on paper. The same adaptability which has seen Mata play Rooney as a CM regularly this season, means he'll get his game next season regardless. Even if we sign a superstar loan striker. As per my previous post, I think he'd be good on the left of a front three.

4972~~~
Hmm, not sure I'd agree. Look at the heatmaps and Young, Herrera, Felllaini and Mata definitely played in a line, with Young and Mata playing quite wide. Obviously Mata was the one that got forward yesterday to good effect. Last week it was Fellaini though.

4973~~~
TBF Van Persie takes them when he's fit. Asides from Rooney yesterday we had an out of form Falcao and a Mata whose only other penalty I can remember was dumped straight into the goalkeeper's hands in the 2012 Champions League final; no-one else that readily takes them and was also on the pitch springs to mind.

4974~~~
Had a bit of a shocker (as usual) on Merseyside yesterday. Its got to the stage where he should just be dropped for games away at Liverpool/Everton. It was obvious he would miss the penalty.

Hope this doesn't lead to him being pushed back into midfield though.

4975~~~
Really? Pretty sure Fellaini had a big part to play in occupying their defenders too, and only you would use Rooneys performance yesterday as something to have another dig at our other strikers. Pretty sure those goals wouldn't have happened without mata on the pitch. Do you remember the last Liverpool game when RVP was one of our best players?

Unless of course you think Moreno didn't lose his man for both goals? Don't see what that has to do with Rooney playing personally.

4976~~~
Yep. Can't remember our midfield scoring as many goals as this year since Ronaldo left. Mata has 8, Herrera and Fellaini have 5 each, Di Maria has scored 4, Bind has 2 and Carrick has 1. 25 goals from central midfielders, quite good return. Usually it was only strikers and wingers scoring goals for us.

Saying that, Rooney was shocking yesterday. There is some black magic spell on him for this game, it always happens.

It's not a tricky concept to grasp. What might help would be reading the post you just responded to. 

By running the channels and dragging the CBs out of position that creates space for other players to exploit. The space between Moreno and his CB, for example, that Mata ran into when he scored his first goal. Even a crap performance from a striker (and that was a crap performance) can be mitigated by hard work and a willingness to run around a lot. The latter two qualities being notably absent from almost all of RvP's performances in the last 12-18 months.

4978~~~
Agreed and this is roughly what I have been saying regarding Rooney's performance yesterday and again I will pose the question - who else would we have played who would have done better [than Rooney]?

4979~~~
You are just blatantly biased when it comes to describing his performances and If you watched many Liverpool games you would see their centre backs getting pulled out of position more often than not and it's something that was picked up on earlier in the season them leaving huge gaps. Nothing to do with Rooney playing. I like how you conveniently compare his game to RVPs worst performances when the team was disjointed with a crap midfield and past it Falcao up top. Funnily out best 2 games of the season are when we have a proper midfield who can play together. How are you meant to know how van Persie would have played considering he's not had the luxury of playing infront of the proper midfield we had yesterday and last week, without Falcao hindering the team? I'm saying that and I liked Rooneys game against Spurs but come on to say the goals wouldn't have happened if he wasn't playing? Surely you don't believe that.

4980~~~
That's not the point. He said the goals wouldn't have happened if Rooney wasn't on the pitch which is just clear biased nonsense.

4981~~~
Its impossible to say one way or another. However I dont think it is outlandish to say that with RVP or Falcao up front instead of Rooney, we would not have had nearly as much movement, and our ability to press Liverpool would have been diminished also.

4982~~~
It's just another stick to beat them players with when they didn't have the luxury of playing infront of a balanced team. RVP has showed plenty in the past that he can cause centre backs lots of problems, heck he done it last time he played Liverpool, and the best defence in the league (this season) earlier on when he didn't have Falcao up beside him. Rooney's always rubbish at Anfield, we all accept that by now but lets not pretend he was instrumental in yesterdays win when he clearly wasn't. Liverpool's defence is always there for the taking.

4983~~~
That all depends if we do go out and try to buy more strikers. If we keep Hernandez when he comes back, we'll have Rooney, RVP, Wilson, and of course Hernandez too, presuming we don't extend Falcao's spell here. That combination of four, while far from perfect, is fairly decent. I'd argue that central defence, potentially right back, and maybe even central midfield which still has its weaknesses will be seen as greater areas of priority in the transfer market. Unless Rooney's form really goes to shit, I can see him being our main striker up front next season, although obviously a lot can change.

4984~~~
I have never claimed that Rooney was instrumental, simply that he offered some qualities that our other strikers dont, and that he did contribute to the win despite not getting on the scoresheet and missing a penalty. I think I rated him a 5, my second lowest (lowest was Di Maria) from the team.

Regarding RVP, he is deteriorating due to his age and hasnt performed well since the world cup, really. Some of this may be due to our poor form for the first half of the season, but RVP at this stage of his career is a pure poacher. His movement in and around the opposition box is probably still good (match fitness issues aside), but he doesnt have anything like the same energy or workrate as the likes of Rooney or Fellaini. I like RVP as a player, and he has some of the best technique in the world, but I dont think we can really justify including him in big away games like Anfield.

4985~~~
He possibly is deteriorating, and he isn't able to play week in week out, but I don't see why he should be judged so harshly for the failed partnership with a past it Falcao, with Rooney and Blind sitting in midfield when the team were clearly struggling as a whole. RVP has had some games this season which were fantastic  and some where he was invisible, and he's never been the kind of striker to chase down defenders and run about all match. Heck, Rooney's work rate wasn't as good as it usually is yesterday. RVP does guarantee good hold up play though, and not giving the ball away to lead counter attacks for the opposition. He still has something to offer.

4986~~~
RVP definitely has something to offer, and I would be happy for us to keep him next season. However I feel my point stands that he is not a player we want to be starting in tough away matches at the moment. Simply put, in games like Anfield we cannot have any passengers - everyone on the team must be able to contribute and work. I think that with Rooney, even when he has a poor game, he still contributes and influences the match. With RVP on the other hand, if he has a bad game we may as well be playing with 10 men. For what its worth, I put Mata into that category as well.

4987~~~
Yeah, has he ever had a good game there? Not that i can remember. Lets just hope he shows up for the game against City

4988~~~
He's done well since we've at last moved to a one striker system but yesterday, in our biggest game of the season against our fiercest rivals, his performance was totally unacceptable. It really is inexplicable how suddenly his entire game can go to shit and we ended up winning in spite of him. By all means he deserves to continue in the same role and I have no doubt he will put in a better performance against villa but yesterday was another reminder IMO that Rooney is indeed a player in decline and if united really are as serious about swiftly getting back to the summit of the game as they say they are then I do honestly think that trying for a top quality centre forward e.g. Lewandowski this summer is the right idea. If not then (considering the business we intend to do to strengthen all our other areas that need reinforcing) I think that the striker position could be a weak point for us next season when we move to the 4-3-3.

4989~~~
This wasn't a good performance as he was quite sloppy on the ball and not so good with his passing. However, he wasn't a total liability up front and still contributed to stretching Liverpool's defence and causing them problems. Quite often, Skrtel had a tough time dealing with Rooney, and him and Sakho were getting attracted to his movement quite often. Two of those moments resulted in the two goals we scored. I'm glad to see that, even if he was not performing well, he was still sharp enough to cause Liverpool's defence problems with his movement and positioning.

Still, though, that doesn't excuse the fact that he didn't have a very good performance. His sloppiness on the ball was quite annoying to see.

4990~~~
I watched the game back last night and he was even worse than I remembered. I criticised Di Maria for repeatedly giving the ball away when he came on but Rooney was just as bad in the first half. It's amazing that we managed to play so well in despite him being so poor.

4991~~~
Definite 433. From van Gaal's mouth and also those graphics that show a players average position throughout the game.

4992~~~
Not sure why there's such a big discussion on Rooney's performance. It's Wayne Rooney, he serves up this type of performance every so often and has done since forever.

He'll score against Villa.

4993~~~
I posted this elsewhere but think it deserseves a mention in the Rooney thread...

I agree Rooney did not play well yesterday. But watch this video esp around 4:42 mark where we see all the work Rooney put in that goes unnoticed most of the time. But because he was willing to do that work, even when his "A" game was missing, allowed us as a team to impose our will for the first 30 mins...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.lfc.vn/motd1/motd-liverpool-man-utd-s15-w30/2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lfc.vn/motd1/motd-liverpool-man-utd-s15-w30/2/</a>

*Also if you watch carefully you can clearly see us line up in a 4-1-4-1 defensively,

And yeah I know it is a Pool site, sorry about that <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>.

4994~~~
Agree. He was actually very efficient off the ball in pressing and closing down the channels, won a few knock downs against Skrtel for layoffs to partners, and as someone pointed out, would have had a goal had Di Maria not completely missed his pass on the break. He wasn't a liability at all when moved into midfield I thought, did what he had to to finish off the game. 

I agree his passing was off though, and the performance was below par compared to the rejuvenated stuff we've seen recently, but then again that happens at Goodison and Anfield, whatever his form of the moment is. 

Yep, had no idea LvG confirmed it, but that's what I thought as well, the shape is different when we're defending and when we're on the ball. 
Actually, loads of players, including top players, have bad games.

4995~~~
Yeah, but considering his history, being an Evertonian, and then a United player, it's quite amazing how consistently poor hes been against Liverpool. Even more so, when you consider he was on fire against Spurs just a week ago. It's quite clear he hates them, and considering his mentality in big games, it's weird he never shows up against them.

4996~~~
Indeed. Few top players look as bad as Rooney does though when he's having one of his bad games.

4997~~~
Perhaps he tries too hard?

5001~~~
lol-grow up.

It was selfish. It's selfish to want to take a penalty if your record isn't good and you deny a teammate a hatrick away at your biggest rivals. Selfish. Please understand this. If it was Phil Jones on a hatrick, then I can understand Rooney taking it. If there was 20+ min to play, then I can maybe understand this as well.

The fact is, it was deep into injury time, Rooney had a shocker so far, Mata was having a good game, and he's technically proficient, and he's on a hat trick away to our biggest rivals. Even Rooney admitted after the game he should have given it to Mata...so the striker himself admitted he was selfish.

But thanks for your contribution. 

It's widely known that AVB wanted Mata to be Chelsea's primary penalty taker. In fact, there's an article about it. I even remember there being a discussion about it on the pitch between Lampard, Droggers and Mata (against I think Man City). I doubt AvB would choose an incompetent penalty taker for Chelsea, especially considering the amount of penalties they get.

Mata was also the 2nd in line penalty taker at Valencia (after David Villa), so again, I doubt he'd be given that position if he was crap at penalties.

Mata is a gentleman-I remember in a League Cup game for Chelsea, he offered the penalty to Torres as he was on a barren run (which he turned down), so it's not much surprise that he didn't complain much when Rooney took the ball.

I agree to an extent, but I stand by what I said, as does Rooney.

5002~~~
I guess people will see what they want to see in that case. I see 4231 in the first half (Carrick and Herrera are deeper with Mata, Young and Fellaini further forward) and quite an obvious 433 in the 2nd half.

5003~~~
Nah. You're just talking crap. Normal service for you in the Rooney thread.

5004~~~
Again, I think you need to grow up. Even Rooney admitting he should have given it to Mata, and you're still going on like a fool.

5005~~~
Total myth. He wasn't as bad as people are making out in here, anyway.

5006~~~
Oi bruv, why'd you tag me innit?

5007~~~
I don't think it is a myth at all. When he's bad he's truly bad. Everything just seems to go. Agree re the 2nd sentance though. 

I didn't watch the game live so watched it with the thought already in my head that Rooney didn't have a good game but I don't think he was anywhere near the levels some were going on about.

5008~~~
Nope. He was the designated penalty taker. End of story. If Rooney scores then we don't even have this utterly pointless discussion.

Your posts on Rooney are normally shite at best and not even limited to Rooney threads unfortunately. You like to spread your crap all over.

5009~~~

5010~~~
Nope-wrong again. In fact, most of my posts about Rooney have been quite reasoned. You're probably one of many who thinks he's world class despite playing atrociously, which is why you get so butt hurt when someone has the audacity to criticise him.

But, I cba arguing about this anymore.

5011~~~
Let's sell Rooney because he never became as good as Ronaldo or Messi <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

One bad game and the knives are out. I can't remember the last United player subject to this kind of scrutiny.

5012~~~
3. Liverpool, Arsenal, Newcastle. That was when he was played in his <i>best and preferred</i> position. And not to forget all the games that he played in the middle.

5013~~~
That actually sums up quite well how I feel about Rooney. Especially the latter paragraph(s). Don't agree with the midfield analysis as this isn't his best position.

5014~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Strawman alert. I criticize him when he plays shite, like against Liverpool and praise him when he's good. You criticize him when he's poor and when he's good.

The fact that you think your posts are "reasonable" sums you up. Absolutely clueless.

5015~~~
So Rooney doesnt score and many goals when in midfield and has spent a lot of this season in midfield. And because he hasnt scored as many goals this season - because he's been played out of position in midfield - we should sell him. With an obligatory reference to the two transfer requests, of course. 

What a fantastic read.

5016~~~
Out of all the strikers we have, he has performed the best this season. So why should he be sold really?
RVP and obviously Falcao should be out the door before Rooney.
Rooney needs to stay, thats not to say I think he is the top level elite no 9 we need, but he is the least of our worries in that department.
He will get us goals, and gives us energy and a threat up top, for now thats enough, but summer of 2016 he'll likely need to be replaced.

5017~~~
He scored against Arsenal and looked excellent in the first half before it all went tits up in the 2nd through no fault of his. Ok against Newcastle and played a vital part in our goal.

If all our players were subject to this kind of scrutiny we'd have to end up selling everyone for not being good enough. But let's single out Rooney eh.

5018~~~
Cool, man.

5019~~~
You also missed the part where it's mentioned his numbers are decreasing, his influence in the team is on the wane, and that shifting him to the midfield had United producing some very poor performances.

Btw, that article is just randomly written, so don't shoot the messenger!

5020~~~
What a load of crap, another Useless article to start the day.

5021~~~
That Beeb article you linked also showed <a class="externalLink" href="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/81833000/jpg/_81833435_juanmata'stouchesagainstliverpool.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this graphic</a> of Mata's touches on the ball. That is clear as day the positioning of a right sided (left footed) attacking player. The overwhelming majority of his touches are wide right & close to the by-line, with a smaller number in the inside right channel, representing when he cuts onto his left foot. He manages two touches close to the box (impressively scoring two goals) but you can see that those are the exception.

To go back the original point, Pogue was saying that Rooney could play in any of the attacking three positions in a 433. If we played like, say, Barcelona, with a proper attacking trident of strikers, who just use wide areas as a place to start their runs to goal, then maybe, since you would expect him to spend as much time close to the box as on the wing.

But by no stretch of the imagination did we play <i>that</i> kind of 4-3-3. Whether you call it 4-1-4-1, 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 is not the point here, the point is that the wide players started really wide, and spent most of their time there. That really wouldn't suit Rooney, or at least hasn't done before.

5022~~~
Not at all, it certainly isnt your fault that you posted a link to an article that I think is almost entirely without merit. I dont even blame the journalist particularly. I just reserve the right to give my own assessment of it.

Sorry I bolded that line because I didnt think I did miss that bit out. But then I guess I did. I thought it was implied, but I guess you could argue it wasnt. He doesnt play particularly well in midfield, and that didnt affect only him, it affected the team as well. 

Does nothing to increase my regard for the article though.

5023~~~
Agree with all of that.

5024~~~
The whole of the Arsenal game was scrappy to say the least. And he played a major part in it. Too many misplaced passes. If anything, he is turning 30 this year. And his overall value is only going to lessen in the coming seasons. 

At max, he has been a decent-to-good player for us. His usual trait of going 8-10 games missing at a stretch was again shown up this season. At one point of time, he really talked just behind Ronaldo and Messi. Currently, I don't think he even features in the top 10 players list.

5025~~~
It's the same every damn year. Just muppets being muppets.

5026~~~
It's the standard drivel you keep hearing from a segment of holier than thou fans who are determined to use their dislike of Rooney as a means to show how much more authentic they are than other fans, on the basis that they will never warm to someone who is a) scouse and b) once considered leaving. It's really fecking tedious.

5027~~~
Heh. For a player who is the highest paid footballer at the club and one of the highest in the world, his performances aren't even in touch with the top 10 players in the world. And that doesn't include him being a) scouse and b) twice* considered leaving.

5028~~~
How much is it now, 350k?

5029~~~
250k. That's what I think he is at. It's still the highest at the club.

5030~~~
Give them enough time and it will be 350m.

5031~~~
Lol, one bad game and the "wage boys" are up and running again, let it go boys, let it go.....

5032~~~
The one thing about Rooney's position at the club I do feel a bit uneasy about still is his role as captain and more specifically the fact that this makes him undroppable. 

I am not saying I think he should be dropped at the moment, because he may or may not have been a bit forgettable against Liverpool. I think he has been as instrumental as anyone for our revival. But I do think we need to stop thinking of him as this player who can play anywhere, who can go back into midfield, on the wing, up, down, left or right and still perform at the required level. He is a lot more versatile than most but he still has a best position and he isnt as good as other people in the squad in other positions. 

But if he has to play every game that leaves us in a tricky position when it comes to our striking options. It means if we want to freshen things up in attack we need to either drop Rooney back into midfield in some capacity, which is probably the best of the bad options, or play two up front, which is a complete no-no for me. 

I think Rooney as things stand deserves to play on merit but next season Id like to see more competition for his place. But given he has the armband I find it hard to see it being taken away, so Im not sure how that is going to go. I expect we will see him remain as captain and play either up front or as the attacking midfielder but I think that is limiting and as good a job as Rooney has done as captain - and I have no complaints about that at all - I wish we'd gone another route for that reason alone. 

Last summer I advocated De Gea for 3 reasons: 1) It may help lock him in with us long term. 2) I think keepers and defenders are well placed to be captains because they get a good view of the game. 3) He is one player who absolutely should be playing every game. I would still give it to him to be honest, as long as he is staying. But as I said I think now Rooney has the armband we are kind of stuck with it. That does worry me a bit.

5033~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69862, @akash02" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@akash02</a> , fyi.

5034~~~
You make good points, but giving DDG the armband might be detrimental to the team when he leaves, Rooney is best suited for that role, if he has lasted this long with the armband without the Caf calling for his head or for his demotion, then i think its fair to say he has done a good job, trust me as a Rooney defender™ this forum is never an easy place for Wazza, you find yourself having to defend him ALOT, i once said if Rooney was having the season Di Maria is currently having, we probably would have already had 100,000 signatures to legalise Lynching to lynch our captain.

Ah...yes, the 350k wage bill never gets old, people don't seem to remember that the club isn't just paying Rooney the player but Rooney the brand coupled with Merchandise,his face,endorsements,appearances and all that corporate crap, its easier to bash Rooney than to praise him.

Imagine if Giggs was chasing Bobby and Shearer for the goalscoring records, there would be a designated forum for him and someone would actually devote himself to  updating the countdown, but its Rooney so its not our problem.

5035~~~
True. If DDG is leaving then it is a bad choice. I hope he doesnt leave. 

And I agree, he has done a good job as captain. I just dont think its healthy for a player to be told he is undroppable, especially a striker. Although Rooney does seem to have found it helpful from a motivational perspective.

5036~~~
1) Haha, you really need to read up and see again what is posted. 

2) Giggs didn't hand in 2 transfer requests because he wasn't being showered with attention at the point.

5037~~~
Yes, Rooney sent in 2 transfer requests, i would too if i was a striker  constantly being played out of position - even Fergie admitted to it - the most important thing is he stayed, we don't know what goes on behind the scenes, a lot of players hand in transfer requests and if Giggs didn't do it then he is probably the odd one out with Scholes (probably).

Why are we still crying about his transfer requests 2 seasons later though? Anti-Rooney clan i presume?

5038~~~
I don't think he <i>sent in</i> a single transfer request. And maybe he just had a bad day the second time.

But it's weird how fans demand loyalty, yet so often show none. Just look at Fellaini, Valencia, Nani, Young, Cleverley, Evans, Büttner, Anderson, and so on and on.

5039~~~
Oh call me whatever you want to. Go create a group with Poster of the year 2008 calling yourself Rooney's Army. 

Rooney was played as the main striker and he scored 26 goals. Next season, he handed in the transfer request and that's when SAF realized we need to have equal replacements in the team if anything happens. And that's when he bought Kagawa and RvP, when again he threw a hissy fit because he wasn't the supposed focal point in the team.

5040~~~
And you know that how?

Even the first time wasn't about him being a focal point in the team.

5041~~~
Yes, 2 seasons ago, lets dwell on that shall we ?

5042~~~
The first one was about Ambition. The second one was admitted by SAF, and I will side with him.

5043~~~
Bad game against Liverpool, why don't we open the book of sins and bash Rooney some more, this isn't even about liking Rooney its about being reasonable, what is the point of digging up stuff from the past to criticise your captain when every single individual in the club has moved on ?

5044~~~
I'm still a firm believer that RVP is a superior no.9 to Rooney, unfortunately it's been well documented that Rooney was never a gym freak and relied on his natural talents too much, in the big games he looks sub-standard physically and never has dominated these games as we thought he would when he burst on the scene all those years ago, which is such a shame when he looked like a headless chicken Sunday.

Let's be honest if RVP  shown hid title winning form or Falcao showing form of old, Wayne would still be in a deeper role and we wouldn't be having weekly debates that he is our best no.9 which he clearly is not, in fact I do not know what his best role is anymore, Jack of all trades master of none springs to mind.

5045~~~
But they aren't that's the point.  RVP and Falcao were given countless chances up front and they didn't perform.  In fact for a run of games Rooney was a bigger goal threat than either even though he was playing in midfield.   If RVP was to show his best form again I'm sure no one would have a problem moving Rooney further back but RVP has no performed for close to 2 seasons now (Rooney was dragging us through certain games last year too).

Funny how this reaction comes off a bad game against Liverpool considering before this Rooney has shown form far far superior to what either RVP or Falcao have this year.  If they want back in the team they need to earn it, but Rooney's performance against Spurs (in one of his 1st games as a striker in years) has earned him the right to be given a run up top.  RVP can be a good option from the bench and if he starts performing again then I sure as hell will want him playing more.  Until then Rooney is simply our best option.

5046~~~
Yep Rooney should really leave, and while we are at it, lets sell Carrick and De Gea too.

5047~~~
TBF I haven't been part of the Rooney no.9 crowd for a long time, like Ferguson I thought and still think he has lost the attributes to play that role,a club of our size and ambition could replace him with a superior player and give him time to make the transition to a midfield player. Granted with hindsight we never knew RVP form / injury woes and Falcao not being able to tie hid laces together, which in my eyes have raised Rooney stock as a no.9 and covered over his huge limitations as a no.9,again not his fault but there are far better options out there for next season which looks like a champions league season after Sunday.

I mean you even admit in your comment that if RVP was on form then Rooney should drop back, which surely kind of nullifies your whole point about Rooney as a 9?

5048~~~
I have always preferred him as a second striker too and I believe the quality of our midfield and the drop in quality of our wingers affected his performances too.  I mean look at Ronaldo when Madrid aren't playing well, look at Messi when Barca are struggling: their levels drop.  Now Rooney isn't at their level so it's obvious that our drop in qualities over the years would effect him.  I agree we should be looking for a striker this summer, possibly with the view to allow Rooney to play Fellaini's current role. However right now he is the best option up top.  I also disagree he looked like a headless chicken against Liverpool, his movement and pressing were pretty good and if not for Di Maria's bad pass he would have scored.  For me the main thing is that he currently looks more likely to get us a goal than the other 2 do.  The fact is because of the form of our other strikers he is the best one we currently have so we have to stick with him for the rest of the season unless one of the others miraculously find form.

To make it clear I'm taking about the here and now and not what we should be doing in the summer transfer window.  It's the same sentiment as saying that Fellaini and Mata should stay in the team over Di Maria and Janujaz etc because they are currently playing better than the others.  Also it pains me to say it but the longer this version of RVP continues the more hope I lose, Rooney has been called finished for showing a few months of bad form before but RVP has been out of form for 2 years.  I really hope he can find it again but currently it'd him I'd sell if I had to choose between him or Rooney.

Edit; I should reiterate that I think RVP should be given chances before the end of the season as it finally looks like our team is beginning to function so maybe this can lift his form.

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Wayne Rooney ready to enter record books and overtake Bobby Charlton at Wembley</b></span>
<span style="font-size: 15px">
Wayne Rooney leads England out at Wembley on Friday night, knowing that he strides towards the record books. He needs four goals to become England’s all-time leading scorer with 50 and will expect to step closer against Lithuania in a Euro 2016 qualifier before heading out to Italy for a tricky Turin friendly.

Rooney was in a very good mood at England’s hotel on Thursday, even revealing that his famous boxing celebration had been re-enacted in the school playground by his son Kai. Rooney’s own focus is more on joining the heavyweights of his trade, passing Gary Lineker’s 48 goals and Sir Bobby Charlton’s 49.
</span>
<span style="font-size: 15px">
Rooney’s sojourn in midfield, a surprising decision by Louis van Gaal, was a compliment to his versatility. 


Rooney was so laid back that he even made a joke about film of his being laid out by Phil Bardsley’s punch.

5050~~~
Edging closer

5051~~~
How many goals does he need?

5052~~~
Two to equal Charlton

5053~~~
Clever header, shame it didn't go in.

5054~~~
Could have sealed the record then and there. Solid performance though, was glad to see him utilizing his speed on the chance that hit the post in a "pace race."

His ball for Sterling was really great too when they interchanged positions. Top assist.

5055~~~
I thought he was motm for England tonight, not Welbeck. Scored, hit the woodwork twice and had a good assist for Sterling.

5056~~~
Glad that he's shaken off his Liverpool performance, regardless if it's for England or United.

5057~~~
He was always going to get over the Liverpool performance. Anfield and Goodison are write offs anyway.

5058~~~
Incredible how that's the case considering how he's performed in the big games throughout his career. Clearly a mental thing.

5059~~~
I did too. Both him and Sterling where better than Danny I thought.

5060~~~
Cant believe no player has ever scored 50 goals for England

5061~~~
or maybe liverpool ground just don't accept Wayne Rooney <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5062~~~
He played well tonight, shows how suited he is to a fluid front 3 where the two wider forwards can interchange with him at will, if we get our business right in the summer we are going to rip teams up next season.

5063~~~
Great overall performance from Rooney yesterday, topped with a goal and an assist.

5064~~~
Our top scorer is not even a striker either...

5065~~~
It is a huge number, at the time there were not so much games, and for example Henry is the french top goalscorer with 51 goals.

5066~~~
Yeah, I agree. Just noting how our strikers haven't really been able to reach silly numbers, though I guess if Owen had been able to stay fit/in form he definitely would have.

5067~~~
Also a good pass for Delph which would have been another assist but for a good save. I really liked his cross for Sterlings goal though. Put it into the right position, but it was bizarre that Sterling made the run and not Welbeck given Welbeck is meant to be a striker.

Rooneys header though was smart and really unlucky. Really wanted to see that go in. Hell get the record within the next four games imo.

5068~~~
1 goal and an assist against Lithuania is hardly 2 goals and an assist against Bahrain...

<span style="color: #ffffff">Hehe</span>

5069~~~
You would think England would have had strikers with a 100 goals with the way Wazza has been touted as a failure

5070~~~
Seems like Telegraph will print anything that sells...wait...of course they will..that's their entire business model...very amateur article.

5071~~~
I'm not sure what annoys me more. The continued and tiresome agenda of the still butt hurt fans, or that needless visual graph representation of United's top scorers.

5072~~~
Rooney won't leave until he gets the record. And like it or not, he is still unbelievably famous all over the world and on pure marketing the owners want him here no doubt.

I think he has 5 more years with us. Then he will have his swan song with Everton. Yes I know they hate him but like Lebron James, his former team would be so happy to have him back they would kiss and make up.

He will most likely end his career as a deep lying playmaker spraying passes all over the place.

5073~~~
I really think as he ages he should just stay as a specialised striker with his exceptional positioning and ability to score goals. Save the running around for others too, he's done enough of it for the past 12 odd years.

5074~~~
I never really watch him for england but its pretty impressive that hes available for every single game that comes both for them and us.
You see half the squad pulling out for the next match and he wouldn't be breaking any records if he didn't show up for every game, every week, for 90 mins, every time.
I think we're lucky to have him tbh. Hes not on ronaldo or messi's level but hes not that far off and hes been on that level for a decade.
Like hes been either our best or second best player every year for ages with one 'weak' season when he only scored 15 or so goals and a similar number of assists.
I don't get the hard time he gets, maybe he'll be looked on more fondly after hes gone.

5075~~~
As weird as it may sound, for some, I have the utmost respect from the man, as a professional. The line that irritates me the most, from the article linked above is: "The numbers – 229 goals in 472 matches – tell only part of the story. Rooney should have been so much more this past decade – a peer for the, albeit peerless, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Rooney’s focus and lifestyle, one suspects, <b>robbed United and England of a critical fraction of his talent</b>", particularly the bold part. I feel, and many others probably do too, that we've done our best, although not consciously, to hinder the progression of his career. To name a few - being behind Ronaldo and then RvP in the pecking order, having to play in midfield among others. I don't think he'd have reached the insane heights set my Messi and Ronaldo, however, he's about 70-80 goals behind where he should be, and that's on United and, to some extent, Fergie (forgive me, your greatness). Regardless, in my eyes, he'll go down as a legend when he retires, and the most deserving to break Sir Bobby's goal scoring record. Wayne Rooney, oh what could have been...

5076~~~
He could still be knocking about in 5/6 years time playing for us. What could still be <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>
Im not convinced he'd ever have been the kind of goalscorer that ronaldo or messi are. He has a lot to his game that isn't going to really show up on stats though.
I dont really want to get into the comparison tbh but whatever he could have been he HAS been great for a long time. 
The versatility and managers making use of it is a bonus imo, even if it doesn't help much with breaking goal scoring records.

5077~~~
Over the last two seasons I have learned again to appreciate Rooney. I have been critical of him, and will continue to be when he plays badly, but I appreciate the way he has knuckled down and led the line over the last two seasons. Especially given the way others, at times, have been given that responsibility and failed.

Rooney has been the only striker to really 'show up' for United this season. Wilson's a youngster so can't be expected to be brilliant, but Falcao and Van Persie have both underperformed. Rooney is not even at his best, and in my opinion he hasn't been for years (although there were signs of a renaissance against Spurs e.g. the outside of the boot cross field pass to Fellaini). However, just Rooney's willingness to run the channels, play with his back to goal, and harry defenders have massively contributed to our recent turnaround.

To be the #9 in the Louis Van Gaal 4-3-3 requires a certain set of skills that few players have: You need to be able to occupy defenders, you need to be able to press from the front, you need to be able to bring others into the game, and occasionally win games single handedly. In world football few players fit that bill. Some strikers may be able to do two or three things but all four? You're talking an Aguero, Costa, Suarez, Tevez of a striker. Rooney has been that for us before, in 2009-10, and he can be that again if Van Gaal continues to trust him up front.

5078~~~
HE started off as a striker didn't he?

5079~~~
Jimmy Greaves probably would have done if he kept focused on paying football.

44 goals in 57 games at international level. Greatest goal scorer to ever play the game.

5080~~~

'I would absolutely urge all those youngsters in the squad, such as Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane, to watch and learn off Rooney from this day onwards.

'They are extremely lucky to be on the same training pitch as this guy and they must make the most of it. It will be a real waste if they do not.

'They must try to copy him. In terms of his dedication and the way he plays. I would also say this to the young lads at Manchester United.
'To play well for six months or a season in football is nothing. To do so for over a decade like Rooney is extraordinary. I know what it takes and it isn't easy.

<b>'Trust me, people talk about him outside of this country. In Spain and France, he is appreciated as a top, top player.'</b>

It's a shame our own fans are incapable of doing the same.

5081~~~
Yep this is true. I have lived in Spain and Greece and he is regarded as one of the best in the world.

5082~~~
He is one of the best in the world, even still, and there's not another striker I would trade him for. He's been an absolute asset for us for s number of years and despite all the scrutiny not only from other supporters, but our own as well, he always manages to produce and react positively. It'll be a sad day when he eventually parts ways.

5083~~~
Which he is. No doubt.

5084~~~
Not really.

5085~~~
Gerd Muller I would have thought was the greatest international goalscorer...

5086~~~
Hopefully he stays with United until he retires. I'd hate to see Rooney leave.

5087~~~
He really is under appreciated in some parts.

5088~~~
Rooney is very popular in foreign countries though.

5089~~~
I kind of feel like his unattractiveness is the problem, he doesn't look,talk or act like a star, if he looked like Nick Powell he would be a god by now.

5090~~~
Yeah, I hate to see Rooney not being truly recognised as an elite player. Whenever I tell my mates Rooney is up there with the best (bar Ronaldo and Messi), I always get laughed at. He's better than Lewandowski and up there with Aguero and Suarez IMO.

5091~~~
In France, I don't really have this problem. Most of my mates that watch football regard him as one of the best players around.

5092~~~
100% agree. Rooney's has performed superbly for us for 10 consistent seasons, and yet some fans don't want to appreciate him because of what he's done in the past, despite him still being here, unlike some players that move to Real Madrid. The guys an absolute legend, whether people like it or not.

5093~~~
How was he on Tuesday evening? Didn't get to see the game!

5094~~~
He was pretty good. Arguably the only attacking player who performed in the first half, and then at the centre of all our best football in the second. Unlucky not to score (must have had a couple saved and a couple off the woodwork). Worked hard, and his long-passing game was in full flow. Produced the pass of the match with a flat, raking 50-yarder floated over a defender and into Walcott, who really should have found the back of the net.

5095~~~
Subtle dig noted.

That aside, it is a shame how he doesn't get the credit he deserves. Henry is spot on, opposing teams on the continent respect him as a player, and they know what he brings to the table.

5096~~~
Cheers!

5097~~~
<b>Ander Herrera feels Wayne Rooney's leadership skills are helping to inspire Manchester United ahead of the run-in.</b>

The club captain gave a passionate speech to the squad following the disappointing FA Cup exit to Arsenal and it had the desired impact with top-drawer performances accounting for Tottenham and Liverpool in two tough Barclays Premier League outings.

5098~~~
Sell him.

5099~~~
Second game in a row where he hasn't impressed at all. Both games have highlighted his really bad first touch.

5100~~~
Under pressure, he doesn't know how to control the ball.

5101~~~
Has ruined almost every bit of good play, but he's working had and creating space.

5102~~~
Done much more than Falcao and rvp would do. 

Caf logic when he plays crap.

5103~~~
Rooney is a very good player, but we should still look to get a new youngish Striker in (and get rid of RVP)

5104~~~
Didn't really do much in the first half, expect him to score though.

5105~~~
No, he's done absolutely nothing, and no more than the two you named.

If he's not playing well, we are entitled to call him out and discuss.

5106~~~
Playing such a disjointed line up earlier in the year with 2 up top clearly hurt our strikers form. They won't be afforded a run up front as a lone striker anytime soon though.

5107~~~
He's just fine today.

5108~~~
I think for games like this we need someone like Mata behind him or Di Maria

5109~~~
How, just how do you come up with this? 

He's been probably our worst player today, barely involved, and lost the ball most of the times due his poor touch, just how is it possible that this is considered as fine?

5110~~~
I have lower standards than you. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

EDIT: What a shit shot, no longer fine! :X

5111~~~
Woah!

Boom!

5113~~~
More than makes up for 75 mins of crap.

Outrageous

One of his best. Just pure class.

His hustle is impeccable.

5127~~~
hahahahaha boom...

5128~~~
Good game by Wazza, scored a superb goal and played a large part in us getting a third one.

5129~~~
If I hear any more Rooney baters I'll go mad. No he doesn't always play brilliantly during a game all the time, but you keep him on for the reasons he proved...a bloody great goal and determination to win the ball to feed Mata. For me, he is the heart of our team...with his work rate, determination and that never want to lose attitude. He's United through and through, regardless of falling out with Fergie...not as though others haven't. He has dedicated his whole bleeding career to us..that has to say something.

5130~~~
Clazza

5131~~~
Not a great game by Wazz today, but a superb goal. Absolutely class.

5132~~~
What a goal that was. Was poor before the goal but much better afterwards. Typical Rooney. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5133~~~
Always gives us a goal and with him closer to opponents penalty area, he is always going to be a threat

5134~~~
I very nearly posted about five minutes before his goal that he'd been sloppy and poor and it'd be typical of him to score a screamer like the overhead v City. Glad I didn't say anything and jinx it <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5135~~~
'Get Falcao on for him'

Not the biggest fan of Rooney myself but people are off their tits with statements like this, great taken goal, needs to sort his shit out when things don't go his way though, he should be the leader on the pitch and not sulking for whole half after a pen's not given (although ref's been incredibly frustrating, yes).

5136~~~
I probably rated him too highly on today's game reading through the thread. Only saw the second half and he seemed fine enough to me. Some heavy touches at times though.

5137~~~
I thought that he was awful before the goal, but what a strike! The man is a genius. Played better after he dropped deeper to Fellaini's position. Again, the strikers dilemma?

5138~~~
Was crap the entire game, then scored a brilliant goal that won it and created the chance practically all by himself to seal it.

Edit: And drew a penalty and red card at the beginning that never was.

5139~~~
Absolute beauty <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> We need a gif stat

5140~~~
I just don't understand why people aren't a fan of Rooney, apart from the problems he had with Fergie. He doesn't always produce brilliantly throughout a game, but then again, nor do loads of the players. But I would always keep him on...no matter what. Because invariably he produces that one piece of magic that can change a game, plus he never really gives up. He's given his whole career to us....

5141~~~
Great goal and great determination for the 3rd. This is why he is our most important player

5142~~~
Looked much better when Falcao came on and he was moved behind the striker. Fantastic goal and determination for the third!

5143~~~
Player, capital 'p'. Captain, capital 'c'.

5144~~~
The goals against Newcastle and the 3rd today are something only Rooney in our squad can cause. His enthusiasm and work rate even at the end of games in invaluable. People get frustrated at him showing his frustration on the pitch or "not being a leader" and needing to calm down but that determination for the 3rd goal was because he felt aggrieved and angry over the drop ball.

5145~~~
I just wish he was as exciting and explosive as the young Rooney:

5146~~~
Sensational goal.

His finishing is absolutely world class.

5147~~~
First player to score in 125 different matches for the same club.

5148~~~
Fantastic goal. Very average other than that.

5149~~~
That sounds...weird. Surely more players did that, right? Or is it just the league?

5150~~~
Average performance but a great goal and made an important contribution for our third goal.

5151~~~
Just the league

5152~~~
Wanted Falcao to replace him around 60th, to give Falcao a bit of responsibility and sit his ass down after a thoroughly average performance but then he pulled off that beauty of a goal plus the hockey assist to Herrera's second.

5153~~~
Worked hard as always and scored a cracker, but trying to deny that he couldn't get the ball to stick at all during the first half seems weird to me.

5154~~~
Typical Rooney. Bitty performance and then scores a <b>banger!</b>

Considering how impotent our strikers have been at times this season, I'll have that.

I was disappointed with him, to be honest.  Yes, he was ripped off of a penalty but he was seething long after that and it was hurting his performance.  You need to be better than that as captain.  Goal, though, was undeniably great.

5157~~~
One of these players has only played 37% of his league games as a striker, compared to 100% of the other two:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s4.postimg.org/a6qgvw7x9/roon.jpg" src="http://s4.postimg.org/a6qgvw7x9/roon.jpg"/>

5158~~~
2 of those players played in an imbalanced side with 3 at the back and Rooney in midfield. Falcao's such a better assister than Rooney did you know.

What site/app is that by the way?

5159~~~

5160~~~
He was awful today, first touch of a rhino. Clearly affected by not getting the penalty and let it get into his head the whole game.

What a goal though.

5161~~~
It's Squawka's comparison matrix.

But yeah, 2 of those players did play in an 'unbalanced' side. Part of that imbalance was down to the fact that the two of them were about as threatening as a soggy lettuce up front, and their lethargy made us look blunt, despite all of our possession.

Since Rooney went back up top, he's looked a much greater threat as an individual, and as a team we're producing our best form of the season.

Probably not a coincidence.

5162~~~
He always comes up with a couple of stunners a season.

5163~~~
The imbalance was trying to fit in 3 players that clearly could not all fit into one team, and having a midfield without a midfielder in it whilst we watched Mata/Herrera sit on the bench for weeks, not to mention an unfamiliar system with 3 at the back for ages. I'd argue that if RVP was in the side at the moment (as the lone striker) he would make an impact, he has shown glimpses in some games and is sure still handy to have around. This is the most balanced our side has looked all season and why's that? Players are mostly playing in proper positions, and ones they are comfortable with, so it makes sense for our best form to come with it.

5164~~~

5165~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5166~~~
Was nowhere near as bad as some are making out.

5167~~~
Most importantly, he score goals when playing up front. Sixth in eight games since LVG came to his senses and moved him up.

5168~~~
Agreed

5169~~~
Quite honestly, we are lucky that Falcao has been absolute crap.  Whether LVG wanted Falcao in that ridiculous setup or not (he may have been forced to by the cost of getting him), the decision to not play him was made up for everybody with his poor performances.  Even if RVP wasn't injured, there was every reason to bench Falcao and put Rooney back where he belongs, at striker.  I don't think we would be playing quite as well without Mata and Herrera together, but if we just had Herrera in the game and Rooney-RVP up front, we still would've improved.

5170~~~
He's always been a great goalscorer of great goals. World class.

5171~~~
Was wondering when we'd see his customary worldie goal this season.

5172~~~
Couple more in the locker yet as well, I reckon. Hopefully being reserved for City and/or Arsenal and/or Chelsea.

5173~~~
So, he can't control a ball played into his feet, but give him one when it's about 8ft in the air that's no problem?!

What a feckin' goal.

5174~~~
I admire his determination, he kept driving for victory. His persistence has created some goals this season. He has proven to me that he deserves to be captain for his spirit as much as his performance.

5175~~~
Rooney is a mysterious player. I cannot think of a player who can have performances ranging from Sunday league player level to world class like him. Great goal, the power generated from a not so easy position was impressive.

5176~~~
Needs 6 more for 300 career goals as a professional (club and country). 17 for Everton, 230 for United, 47 for England.

5177~~~
However shit he may debatably have been besides the goal, we are better off as a team with him up front vs RVP or Falcao. Every match without them just serves to underline that.

5178~~~
Very poor game, outstanding goal though - up there with Angel as our goal of the season.

5179~~~
Juan says hello.

5180~~~
A stunning, stunning goal, didn't think he was too bad overall either. Loved the celebration after the goal too, the team seems to have a great spirit.

5181~~~
Reminded me of this goal:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uAZpQ8ktwQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Sensational finish.

5182~~~
Average game but more then made up for it with that stunning goal. Impressive.

5183~~~
loved that era.

5184~~~
My lord, the compilation of 'Rooney's greatest goals' once he retires is going to be absolutely incredible.

5185~~~
I actually thought he was decent today, and I'm not his biggest fan.

5186~~~
I didn't see the game but after watching the highlights I think the ''Rooney was poor'' posts are a bit over the top,  he should of had a penalty early in the game, he scored a unreal goal and assisted our third goal after fighting and winning the ball.

5187~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I thought the exact same!

5188~~~
Not his best game but great goal. He's a brilliant finisher.

5189~~~
Terrible performance, ridiculously good goal.

5190~~~
Rooney was just electrical at that time. He was still young so you wondered just how far he could go. Every time he got the ball in the final third he would run at defences and they'd shit themselves.

5191~~~
Played like shite then scored a screamer. That'll do.

5192~~~
Rooney was absolutely electric throughout that game.

5193~~~
Ruud, Rooney, and Ronaldo all in one side. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5194~~~
His second half performance was better compared to first and what a stunning goal was that.That was clear penalty but he goes for excessive appeal for which referee in any case never going to change his mind his desicion.

5195~~~
That's why they call them highlights<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Only joking, his effort is not questioned, but him, Fellani and Carrick seemed to give the ball away, or be a bit lethargic for most of the match.

5196~~~
Utterly brilliant finish. He is absolute top quality, could play for any team in the world and we are a much much better side with him in it.

5197~~~
You just cannot replace his influence. Rooney always delivers. Goals, assists, energy, determination. 
Yeah we all get frustrated with his touch and his passing but goals are whats most important.
6 goals in 8 games is simply brilliant and if we shove Rooney up front all of next season, he'd bag a cool 30 with ease. 

I'd like to be in James Wilson's boots. Imagine asking Rooney to explain how he scored that goals against Villa.

5198~~~
This. People are crazy. It wasn't his best game, but he was okay, had a certain influence throughout, and was decisive when he needed to. What a bloody goal!

5199~~~
Yep, agreed.

5200~~~
The good thing about that though is for them players once in form its rare for them to have bad games, the only one I'd worry about losing confidence is Rooney but how could he leave after that goal and assist without confidence? 

Getting the once-off bad game out of the way for 3 of our big players against a lower team that we beat is very good. I expect them all to be fine after a week of training to batter City.

5201~~~
Yesterday he scored when he was moved to midfield. I don't get it, was Fergie stupid not to move him up front all those years? Why is it when a player scores a lot of goals from positions an attacking midfielder should get in, he should be 'promoted' to central striker?

5202~~~
Could've had a 30 goal season this year if we lined up the same from the beginning of the season

5203~~~
I think he will be moved behind the striker when RVP will be fit. He's managed to score quite a few goals since he's the main striker, but his all round performances have not been that good.

I think he needs to be involved more, take yesterday for example, he had a shit game, but when Falcao came on and he was moved behind the striker he looked like a different player.

5204~~~
He didn't score because he was moved to midfield, though, as his position was that of a forward when he slammed the half-volley into the back of the net. What Sir Alex did with Rooney has nothing to do with what I said; it's a rather moot point in all honesty. 

The premise here is that we have a 20-goals-a-season striker in Rooney. Considering the fact that Falcao looks way of the mark and RVP is injured, then instead of insisting with playing said 20-goals-a-season striker as a midfielder, van Gaal realised that he should keep him up front as a forward and at the very least, a supporting striker.

5205~~~
No, he came running behind Falcao, Falcao was up front, but DiMaria played the ball backwards to the midfielder who was in the right spot for a midfielder, instead of closer to gaol to find the striker. The striker should and did go for the ball to slide it in or something if it would come nearer to the goal.
I sense that people want Rooney up front because that's his natural position. If it is, was Ferguson wrong not to recognise that? "Van Gaal came to his senses" sounds to me like he didn't know what he was doing when he didn't play him up front, and it should have had nothing to do with RVP beeing injured. 

A supporting striker in 4-4-2 and an attacking midfielder in 4-3-3 is usually the same player and generally the same/most alike role. If you have an only 20 goals striker, you'll need a lot of goals from midfield, and that's gonna be hard if your most prolific midfielder plays up front. I'd rather have a 15 goal midfielder and a 15 goal striker than a 20 goal striker and a 5 goal midfielder, for example. But I think Rooney should be a 20 goal midfielder, because that's what he does best, running into to box, not beeing there already. It's by no means a demotion, the 10 position is the position where a player can be most important and score a lot of goals. Especially with Van Gaal it's not unusual for the attacking midfielder to score more goals than the centre forward. 

Maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree here, and did I mistake your for someone who thinks Rooney should stay up front, no matter the availability of (other) strikers. But still, I think he has scored typical for an attacking midfielder, both on position and skills required.

5206~~~
This, a thousand times this.

Rooney is without doubt one of the best strikers on Earth, for whatever reason fans on here don't seem to grasp this until he gets played upfront for a prolonged run of games and then everyone's like, 'oh feck, yeah, he's brilliant isn't he?'.

5207~~~
Rooney has always scored goals when played upfront but I don't think he performs aswell. 

For example, he scored 34 goals in 2011/12 but I would argue he performed better in 2007/08 where he got half that total. 

Overall though it's worth having him upfront just because he does score lots of goals. Especially when we have players like Mata to go in behind.

5208~~~
Rooney's goal against Spurs was awesome, even better I would suggest than the Villa game, where he received the ball with four Spurs players around him and he nutmegged the one defender and scored. That's the type of player that Rooney is but he also does so much more in that he will chase back right through to the back to defend a ball.

I have criticised him at times in the past but I felt he deserved it, this season and specifically these past few games when he has played and been marked heavily, he still is able to score.

5209~~~
Brilliant goal on Saturday. The touch was top class.

5210~~~

5211~~~
A greater one than Roy Keane, anyways.
<span style="color: #ffffff">Ready, set, go!</span>

5212~~~
Looked online recently and according to statbunker Rooney is close to being the second best assister and goalscorer of all time in the Premier League (Fabregas is pretty close to him though in terms of assists and will probably overtake him at some stage).  This is a crazy achievement and for me cements his place as an all time great.  

Where would people place him in regards to Shearer?  For me Rooney should be regarded as clearly the better of the two.  I remember Shearer quite well and he was a great player but regardless of if Rooney catches him as top scorer I just don't think Shearer was as rounded a footballer as Rooney is which is backed up by the assists stats.  Obviously people will state Shearer played at an inferior club but Rooney has played a lot of different positions and I believe he would have already overtaken Shearer's goals scored if he had played up front for the last few years.

5213~~~
Not sure if serious.

Edit*

*flops wetly on a boat deck*

5214~~~
This is a post I found in the van Persie performances thread about Rooney in the Fellaini role. I'll also add in my response to this post here.

Plus, Rooney's also suited to coming in from the left given how often he played as a left-sided forward in Queiroz' 4-3-3 and Sir Alex's 4-4-2.

The more I see Fellaini perform in his freer role, the more I believe Rooney can be well-set for it. He, like Fellaini, normally draws in two opposing players on the ball. Like Fellaini, he combines well with players, particularly the winger. Also, he's quite energetic and aggressive off the ball, and his defensive positioning, whilst still loose, is improved under van Gaal. My only concern is that his touches are inconsistent (often heavy, then often sweet, etc.), plus his vision and pass choices aren't the best. Also, he's played this role before in the exact same 4-3-3 formation against Man. City and Crystal Palace and wasn't effective enough on both occasions.

However, given how we've settled, I think he can do well in that role. His positioning and movement in a more withdrawn role is immaculate, and it makes the most of his strengths and style of play whilst minimising his weaknesses. Still, we should only do that if we get a striker who's dynamic and can occupy defenders every time in just same way Rooney does for us at the moment.

5215~~~
Not sure who would be a good available candidate. Lacazette?

5216~~~
A bit irrelevant but apparently he only has one goal away from home in the league this season, the Arsenal one... Weird. 11 in 13 at home though which is class.

Anyway, hopefully he has a good game tomorrow, has a pretty decent record vs City.

5217~~~
Rooney Question and Answers:

Best footballing moment: Winning the Champions League in Moscow
Best PL moment as team: Winning the game against Arsenal (8-2)
His Best Premier League Goal: Goal against City(bicycle kick)
Captains looked up to: Roy Keane, Neville, Vidic, Beckham, Gerard(gave various reasons for all).

5218~~~
What exactly does he offer that RVP does not? He doesn't score many goals as a striker and he isn't fast. He did have a fantastic flick though, I'll give him that.

5219~~~
Why?

5220~~~
He's a lot faster than Van Persie, he pressures the opposition a lot more, better in the build up.

5221~~~
Watch the game you daftie.

5222~~~
Whilst I don't agree with Rossa, this is hardly a game that disproves his point.

5223~~~
His overall play and contribution has been much better than RVP's this season lately.

5224~~~
I gave him the flick - he has done nothing else, has he?

5225~~~
And he defends more than RVP.

5226~~~
Oh, right...

5227~~~
Utterly daft post that stinks of someone having a serious agenda Rooney. Ridiculous.

5228~~~
This season RVP has been hit and miss, no doubt, but to say that Rooney is a huge upgrade is just rubbish. He had one good game but then settled down to mediocrity. Fact is that he is no longer a world class player.

5229~~~
Or he has a different opinion to us. While I don't agree with him and think Rooney offers much more than RVP up front at the moment, people could at least attempt to refute his point and understand that not everyone shares their views.

5230~~~
He isn't a lot faster - that's based on things in the past. In the same game both players had exactly the same run against the same player; RVP closed him down a lot faster than Rooney did - I agree that Rooney is faster, but not by much. It's not Navas vs Blind.

5231~~~
Yeah, sure.

5232~~~
He's had a fair few good games lately though. Not been great today, and he's not perhaps been at his very best, but his overall game and contribution has been very beneficial up front for us over the past couple of months.

5233~~~
We know what usually happens now . . .

5234~~~
Not having an agenda, but I don't think that Rooney is good enough anymore, and I don't see him as a massive upgrade on RVP. Neither scores enough goals, and Rooney's ball retention and short passing are worse than RVP's.

5235~~~
Rooney will definitely score - I know<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5236~~~
He did have a couple of good games, but so did RVP. He has always been a little hit and miss.

5237~~~
I don't need to. He has history of anti Rooney nonsense from previous threads. Really sad that people spend their time waiting for Rooney to slip in the smallest of ways so they have a pop at him... Oh well

5238~~~
Rooney's generally been excelling in leading the line for us for the past couple of months now. RVP had some okay games here and there, but I don't think he's really had a sustained spell of very good form over the season.

5239~~~
Ah right, didn't know he had history. Even then though, better to address the post itself.

5240~~~
What the heck are you on about? And what about addressing me instead? Cheesy is having a good discussion. I asked a serious question. I didn't say that Rooney was utterly garbage and should never play a game in his life for us never again, did I?

5241~~~
That was an opportunity when Fellaini headed the ball to him. Don't know why he didn't turn and shoot rather than hook it.

5242~~~
I'm a massive Rooney fan but his hold up play is got to be better as it's been dire. The same as it was against Liverpool. Come on Wazza!

5243~~~
He does appear more grown up, but I always get the sensation that he is a handy player when things are going well, but he often sulks when things are not going well; the last couple of months, the team has played well, and subsequently he looks better, and leads the line better as well, but are you satisfied with him when the going gets tough? 

Anyways, as a striker, It's probably his best position, but I just fail to see how he's a major upgrade on RVP. Am I bashing Rooney more than those who want Rooney over RVP are bashing RVP? Bizarre logic that.

5244~~~
His vision isn't good enough - people compare him to Scholes, but no doubt would Scholes have seen Fellaini there.

5245~~~
He's been poor on the ball but he's taken Kompany out of the game.

5246~~~
You must have an agenda against Rooney then <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> 

It's weird though, because when he was younger, his hold up play was terrific, so strong.

5247~~~
I do think you've got a decent point with the first part in that a lot of his good form has perhaps coincided with ours, however from watching us over the past couple of months, I'd have to say there's a clear difference in play between him and RVP when Rooney's in our side. Works harder, and contributes more to the team as a whole. RVP can get away with that only if he's scoring a superb number of goals, I think.

5248~~~
He's been relatively quiet, similar to his last few games; won't stop him from running and hassling their defence.

5249~~~
Yep strong but it's his touch that's been dreadful when his back is to goal.

5250~~~
He does work harder and is much better defensively. However, I don't think RVP is as poor defensively as people claim. He often sprints back to make an intercepting tackle; he does seem a little more at loss in taking up positions whilst defending than Rooney. A weird thing is that RVP is stronger at hold up play than Rooney, but much, much weaker in dueling for the ball. Agree with your last sentence; I'm not quite sure what happened with RVP's finishing. 

I'm not convinced with Rooney's movements up front - no runs in behind the defense.

5251~~~
Agree - that and his short passing leaves a little to be desired. I never fully understood how one can master 40 yard passes, but not 4 yard passes.

5252~~~
He only ever looks to the right hand side of the pitch.  Fellani was through in the goal if he just turned around and seen him.

5253~~~
Third game in a row, he can't hold the ball to save his life at the moment, but he'll probably come up with a late goal which will make people say he's been good..

5254~~~
The last counterattack just before the HT whistle, when he chose to switch it to Val with the entire City defence on that side rather than Fellaini free behind him was the most depressingly inevitable thing I've ever seen.

5255~~~
Not today perhaps since it's not been his strongest game, although this is arguably something he was adding to our team that RVP didn't when we started playing him up top again.

5256~~~
To be fair his all round game has been ok and he is full of energy but if he held the ball up better we would be thumping City.

5257~~~
It's too drilled into him. I said in the match day thread, Rooney to Valencia must be up there as one of the most played passes in football history.

5258~~~
The first couple of games he was great - I was very happy with him, but his form has fallen since then, I think. He wasn't good against Liverpool at all, for instance, and I don't recall him being good against Tottenham either. I didn't watch the Villa game though, maybe he was great there?

5259~~~
He was superb against Spurs but since then he's been poor, 10 minutes against Villa aside.

5260~~~
What a sheltered life you've must lead.

Come on Wayne lad, let's have 'em eating their words!

5261~~~
Well he did get that excellent goal against Villa. And he was one of our key players against Tottenham. Worked hard, and got a goal too.

5262~~~
If he plays well in the 2nd half I'm sure he'll get credit for it. Come on Wayne.

5263~~~
You're probably right - Tottenham game being too far back for my aging memory. Closing my laptop for the second half and fit to resume the discussion afterwards <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5264~~~
Yeah, most of our team was superb in the Spurs game, to be fair.

5265~~~
What I will say though as I have said in other threads is that I see RVP as a better #9 purely because of how good his hold up play is. I don't think Rooney is very good with his back to goal and is a lot more comfortable playing from deeper positions and is a better finisher.

Sorry for snapping but it's annoying to see people take pot shots at him for no reason when he's playing quite decently.

5266~~~
That post was entirely serious.

5267~~~
Did ok there in fairness didn't he?

5268~~~
Delayed the pass a bit too much, it's good the linesman didn't see <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

5269~~~
Glad he went left that time.

5270~~~
Having a Di Maria type game ( ok/average performance and an assist), would be interesting to see what the Di Maria defenders think about this.

5271~~~
That's ok mate - don't think I've seen you done that before <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Agree with what you said. I don't think Rooney played well today. He worked his arse off, and bullied their defenders with all he had; he even had a sweet assist, and thus he is hard to criticize. I just feel that he loses the ball far too often, too easily might I add. Also, he needs to stop dropping so deep and rather get into good scoring positions.

Edit: btw, my average rating of Rooney is 6.2 as is that of the entire CAF - not that much of an agenda then perhaps? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5272~~~
Agree that he was a little meh today? Great assist, but he just loses the ball far too often.

5273~~~
Oh yeah, I'd definitely say he was fairly average today.

5274~~~
88% pass accuracy. Only Mata did better.

5275~~~
If we had Aguero up front we'd have won by 10.

5276~~~
Not his passing, that was fine, but the amount of times he had a poor touch. Those can hardly be denied can they?

5277~~~
A couple but people over emphasize when it comes to Rooney. Mata for example fecked up a couple of touches which halted our momentum going forward but you sure as hell won't see that mentioned in that thread.

5278~~~
Your agenda is ridiculous. You think Rooney's been fine but you are critisizeing Mata. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Another shit game for Rooney, we would be even better if he was any better in last three games.

5279~~~
Rooney was average today no doubt..... but, Centre Forwards usually have these type of games, his defensive ability and work rate gives him the edge over the Colombian and RVP.

5280~~~
I agree.

5281~~~
Because Mata rarely does that - Rooney has a poor first touch, and it is something I find it weird that commentators don't pick up on.

5282~~~
Learn to read you muppet. I'm not criticizing Mata at all and that should have been obvious if you could read.

Shit game and apparently I am the one with the agenda<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5283~~~
Wasn't at he's best today but I think that's more down to that the three City center backs throughout the game kept him at an arms length. That said the pass for Juan Mata's goal was sexual.

5284~~~
We wouldn't have.

People are just absolutely crazy when it comes to Rooney. Had a very good game as a #9 today, did what he had to. I'm sure Van Gaal was very happy with his performance.

5285~~~
I'm not sure he did. He was just okay today after being largely crap for the first 50-60 mins. It certainly wasn't one of his better games.

5286~~~
He really didn't to be honest.

5287~~~
Didn't have a major direct impact on the game but didn't need to.  Still played with passion and no doubt affected the game and the way we played indirectly.

5288~~~
Rooney was playing further forward, with his back to goal, while being tightly marked by centre backs who are bigger and physically stronger he is. It's hard to bring the ball under control in those circumstances.

Certainly harder than receiving it in midfield, where there's a bit more time and space.

That's probably why when Rooney dropped deeper, nothing got away from him. And why during his period in midfield, his losses of possession per game via a bad touch <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/wayne-rooney-2014-2015-knock-out-performances.393849/page-105#post-17172240">compared favourably</a> with Aguero's, Sanchez's, Hazard's, Costa's, Ozil's, etc. That's a fact borne out by the stats.

Speaking of Aguero, I thought he did nothing today apart from the goals.

That's a pretty big 'apart from' though, and is really besides the point. He is in that team to score, and he did, twice.

The point i'm making is that it's not only Rooney who can look a bit 'meh' while still contributing goals and assists. But Rooney, because there's a greater focus on him, gets far more harshly criticised for it.

5289~~~
He's been hit or miss as a centre forward to be honest. Looks like he'd rather play deeper and be more involved, but that would come at a cost as our midfield has been so much better since he hasn't been in it. The Spurs game was great but since then, not been very good at all although the Villa goal was a cracker. One thing he always offers is high work rate, but his ability on the ball has been mediocre.

5290~~~
He kept the CBs occupied, managed a few flicks to partners when he finally got on the ball and wasn't wasteful at all in difficult positions. It was a very hard game to play and he was very good in the role he was meant to play.

5291~~~
Got an assist, constantly pressed and occupied the defenders... Didn't have a huge on the ball impact but it's his work rate and off the ball work which is streets above any other striker bar tevez.

5292~~~
He's better than our other forwards but that isn't saying much. If a Suarez or Aguero type forward was on the market I'd snap em up as soon as possible and relegate him to our back up striker.

I really appreciate Waynes endeavour this year.. his charisma and energy has been top notch but in terms of technique and athleticism he isn't world class any more throughout a game... he has moments of brilliance but in terms of beating players and having a consistent touch under pressure .. very hit and miss.  He is a hard working centre forward now but to take this team to an even higher level we need a world class player up top - if indeed one is available.

5293~~~
Yea he kept them busy and he got an assist which is always important, but he had a very heavy touch and a few things fell apart due to him. It wasn't a very good game for him by any stretch, and it's undermining him to suggest it was.

5294~~~
Having watched the replay of their 2nd goal, he's actually at fault, given that he was assigned the DM role.

Overall, he wasn't great, but hasn't been required to do much.

5295~~~
I wasn't clear. I don't think he was excellent or anywhere near our best player, loads of others had better games than him. But he was deployed in a very specific role in which he was not going to shine, but was ultimately really important in ensuring that the gameplan went as planned, and that other players shined. 

And yeah, getting that assist for the third goal was very important. Put the game to bed for us.

5296~~~
Some loose first touches today but he pressed their CB's relentlessly and got a quality assist for Mata's goal.

5297~~~
I don't think he was overly great today, but I agree that people can be incredibly reactionary when it comes to Rooney.

5298~~~
Please. Great assist, but sexual? Berbatov's 360 spin for Ronny was sexual.

5299~~~
No, Berba's was pornographic. Wayne's reserve pass today was brilliant also.

5300~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Would never have used that term. To each his own! But I think you're overrating the assist. I'm not doubting its quality because it was.

5301~~~
If he isn't amazing, then fans aren't interested in what he has to offer, they just brand him as crap, which is funny because an assist is usually enough to vindicate a crappy performance from Di Maria....but not for Rooney.

sometimes I wonder what this thread would look like if Rooney played like Di Maria this season.

5302~~~
Who is vindicating Di Maria now? Pretty sure most of this place wanted Young to start over him today. Always have to bring other players into it when Rooney has a poor game. It's either no service, marked by the defenders, always an excuse. Everyone laughs at the quality of Kompany and Demechelis these days, and don't even mention Mangala, yet Rooney couldn't get an inch out of them all game. The assist was great yeah, clear offside though and he wasted 2 big chances in the first half with that weird touch and ignoring Fellaini's run. Like I said and others say, his work rate is second to none, but his actual ability is as inconsistent as it gets. Bordering Falcao levels today until that assist.

5303~~~
shhhh! he only reason we're winning games is because Rooney is doing some Rambo - one man army - stuff. Everyone with good cop-on knows Roone isn't very good technically and doesn't have great vision. What he will give you though is much better pressing off the ball, okayish work rate down the channels and he's one of he best poachers in he game. Unfortunaely for us, RVP has great technique and touch, but doesn't have the pace and work rate of Rooney. If we could get the best of both we'd have the ultimate number 9. It's hard to find strikers to be the perfect lone striker - Benzema and Lewandowski are the best by far.

5304~~~
Well, you try to talk about Di Maria's crappy performances and fans throw his stats at you to vindicate him, why shouldn't Rooney be vindicated in the same way too ? It's not like we were hitting City with that direct play from the Middle, our strategy today would have left any CF dormant,this is where Rooney comes in, his work rate and ability to play like a midfielder helped the teams fluid attacks, Rooney could easily have been at the end of that ball to Smalling.

This is not to say he wasn't poor at times, he still offers more to the team than any Striker we have.

It's like with Rooney "its score a brace or you're crap", Aguero just came off a 6 game goal drought,don't think Rooney can be afforded such luxury on here, you see some people calling for Falcao...... To do what exactly?

5305~~~
In the first half alone I don't think he held the ball up under pressure once. Doesn't matter who you are playing against that's pretty shocking. Our attacks are fluid because we are playing proper midfielders and playing with loads of confidence.

Who was calling for Falcao exactly?

5306~~~
Rooney was poor today, again. Deal with it lads and move on because we beat City 4-2 and even I can get over this performance after that result.

5307~~~
He was just fine today.

135th assist, 100 of them in PL. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

5308~~~
Completely agree.

It's as if people don't understand the role he actually plays and the effect his tireless pressing and movement causes the opposition.

Replace Rooney with Falcao or RvP for the Liverpool and City wins and you'd see a very, very different game play out...

5309~~~
I thought was good. Not great, but he worked hard, made a lot of runs which made the other players space. It's not easy playing as a lone striker but he's doing a good job of it.

5310~~~
Great assist, besides that I thought he had an ordinary game. Some of the touches in the first half were horrendous, second half was a bit better.

5311~~~
RVP hasn't had the luxury of playing in this perfectly balanced team, so making assumptions like that are daft. Rooney was one of our worst players in both games, yet we won both with possibly our best 2 performances of the season. Must be all Rooney.

5312~~~
Are you in any way suggesting we bench Rooney for RVP?

5313~~~
Van Persie couldn't press from the front as Rooney does, and that's what would make the difference that I'm talking about.

To suggest this team isn't benefitted <i>massively</i> from Rooney's work rate is idiotic - likewise to suggest RvP or Falcao could do a similar job is just laughable.

5314~~~
He's a bit mental when it comes to Rooney vs RvP. Well, I say "a bit"...

5315~~~
I haven't really followed any of the argument and I understand Rooney had an average game today but there is no way Van Persie could do the role we're asking Rooney to do. Our pressing game from the front really  relies on Rooney just being on edge constantly. Given we're playing Mata and Fellaini behind him you really need someone like Rooney up front.

5316~~~
Nope, I'm saying he's been inconsistent recently.

5317~~~
I never mentioned Falcao. I'm saying the team is finally settled and RVP didn't benefit from that earlier in the season.

5318~~~
Very good game?

He worked very hard and did well off the ball but the quality just wasnt there on the ball. It was an average performance. Glad he atleast picked it up in the 2nd half. 1st half was poor.

5319~~~
Quietest attacking Utd player on the pitch but he did get better as the game went on, nice assist for the 3rd goal.

Nothing special today but who cares. Celebrate the victory!

5320~~~
Mental is claiming we wouldn't have scored 2 goals against Liverpool if it wasn't for Rooney. Wonder who came out with that...

5321~~~
I thought he was good. He worked hard and kept bringing into the game, which gave us a great platform to build from.

5322~~~
He was average today, had some poor touches but his work rate always proves to be valuable, relative to RVP who can be really anonymous when he is having a bad game. Still managed to create a goal albeit it being marginally offside.

It is the same scenario though, you will have a few odd comments being overly critical of Rooney making him seem worse than he actually was and a few other comments trying to compensate for the anti-Rooney bias and trying to make him look better than he was for that match.

5323~~~
Still better than RVP and Falcao and can still snatch a goal or an assist in his worst performance, i do however agree with your point about RVP not playing in this winning team yet.

5324~~~
Removing him from the midfield and our build up has been one of the catalysts for our change of form.

5325~~~
Orton posts in this thread and the RvP thread should just be put on auto ignore. The bias is unreal in both cases. RvP has been woeful but the constant excuse is that he never played in a balanced team. Rooney has played half the season in CM <i>and </i>an unbalanced team and done far better. RvP should get nothing more than a bench role at this club till the end of his contract now. Even when Rooney is "rubbish", he's better than RvP the way we play.

5326~~~
Thought he was perfectly fine today. Nothing spectacular, but contributed well enough.

5327~~~
Got to admit, slightly worried with his form.

Then again, knowing Wayne he'll score 6 in the final 6.

5328~~~
What is wrong with him? He is decent to good technically, not some pub level footballer. So why on earth does he have games at times where he loses every single ball and some of them even under no pressure at all?

5329~~~
Lets be honest, his workrate is amazing and he has his useful contributions even with an assist or goal at times.

But he has been the weakest link in our team for the past 5 matches.

I can see RVP easily outperforming Rooney in the current team.

5330~~~
Poor first half but good 2nd. We are undoubtedly a better team with him up top stretching defences, he could be doing better with his back to goal at the moment though

5331~~~
Great workrate today, chased everything down. To be fair City pressured him well and he didn't have much space against Kompany. I thought we didn't do enough to find him if I'm honest.

Beautiful assist when putting Mata through, solid performance overall.

5332~~~
He's been very average since the Spurs game, which is the type of performance that should be regarded as good/very good. To be content with his performance today is undermining his ability. He's capable of far more than those incredibly poor first touches we've witnessed since the Liverpool game, however, he displayed (today) two pieces of brilliance which demonstrate what he can offer - the free kick and the assist to Mata. Can you fault his effort? No way, but it's not enough. Luckily for him, and us, the team has gelled and is playing with absolute fluidity. 

The question we should ask is how much better can we be with Rooney at his best? Frightening, if you ask me.

5333~~~
Disciplined performance by him which served us well. In matches like those when he's playing upfront he normally ditches being a forward and drops deep which leads to the opposition defence pushing up leading to more pressure on the mids. Instead he stuck it out despite how tough it was in there, especially with Kompany on. 

In terms of on the ball he was on and off. It was really tough in there and at times he'd receive the ball with 3 around him, he's hardly going to win those. When he received it with a semblence of space I thought he did well. Some nice turns and flicks. Pretty much like how aguero was struggling to get any change from our backline when we got a firm grip on the game. The line leading striker relies a lot on service, and if the ball to him is a hail mary then its going to either stick or not.

5334~~~
The same RvP who doesn't bother running, who has no pace to stretch defenses, who wouldn't ever put the sort of pressure that lead to goals vs Newcaslte and Villa, who doesn't bother doing much defensive work and the same RvP who has looked way off the pace all season? Maybe a new striker could do a better job than Rooney but none of the other strikers at our club can do this role better than Rooney is doing. RvP of two years ago maybe, not this version who doesn't look fit beyond the 60th minute.

5335~~~
Thought he was effective today. Not brilliant by any means but pressured their defence and held up the ball decently well.

Move on to Chelsea.

5336~~~
It's the simple things he does, like running the channels to give full backs/wide midfielders a passing option when there's nothing else on, that make us actually work as a team. 
Whether or not Rooney's at his best at the moment is irrelevant; neither Falcao nor RVP have done the things the team needs when given a chance this season.

5337~~~
He was fine today. Holding up the ball against Kompany and Demichelis is always a battle and they've gone in tight on him before. But he worked hard, showed good energy and had no sloppy lay-offs which normally creeps into his game when he isn't involved on the ball as much as he'd like.

5338~~~
Was about to type out a post but this sums up my feelings well.

He's doing an unsung job at the moment and our other key players are getting the goals, assists and plaudits.

He'll want to be among the goals but the man is our captain now and we're playing great.

5339~~~
Really poor today, and the assist (which has put a gloss on a shoddy performance) should've been ruled out for offside, purely for Rooney's delayed pass. When he turned I thought he was once again looking for a switch to the right flank, he  put Mata through when he realised that it was the only passing option. When Fellaini was clear at the end of the 1st half, he switched to Valencia from the same position. LvG needs to teach him to use both halves of the pitch, not just the right flank.
Besides that his hold-up play was off today, he kept losing tha ball under minimal pressure and Falcao showed him up on that front (I don't think he lost the ball once after he came on)- not a sentence I would ever expect to type.

5340~~~
There is absolutely no reason to think that Falcao wouldn't be able to perform to at least same level as Rooney did today, his couple of performances when he had match sharpness were better than last three Rooney's performances. Saying that, it means nothing when Rooney was poor in last three games, probably our weakest player, plus I don't see any reason to start Falcao anymore this season anyway. But still, saying that Rooney is the best at this role with this form isn't true, both Falcao and van Persie had better performances than this even while we were struggling with our play and formations.


Your reasoning is wrong, the main reason why van Persie played so many games was exactly for those same reasons. He understands what van Gaal demands from his players and he understands his role in pretty much every formation we've played. Van Gaal talked about that many times, and that is the last reason why van Persie shouldn't play.

5341~~~
Absolutely laughable. 

I <i>almost</i> hope Falcao starts a game up top on his own again just so you can see how idiotic what you're saying is.

5342~~~
We are better with him. Pretty obvious. The nit pickers can feck off after today.

And rooney is better then benzema for the record.

5343~~~
Love Wazza but he's been shite today, Villa and against Liverpool

5344~~~
Okay performance but I'd still have him as our main striker over the others. He's mobile and scores goals.

5345~~~
It's the same names over and over (as it is defending him, but then we're right, and they're wrong).

Saying he didn't play well is one thing. But it's just blatant revisionism to say Falcao - this version of Falcao - could do just as well.

He had numerous chances earlier in the season, and was by and large unconvincing, which is why he's been indefinitely relegated to the bench.

Don't like it, take it up with LvG.

5346~~~
Pretty much this. He wasn't great, but just because he wasn't great doesn't mean he was bad, and vice versa.

Rooney's movement and positioning caused Man. City's defenders problems, particularly with Fellaini overcoming Yaya Toure. Him dropping deep meant that there was space for Mata and Fellaini to run into, and him dropping deep allowed for lots of spaces to be created behind him, which Valencia exploited very well in the second half. In the second half, Mangala couldn't even contain him, and as a result, Rooney was causing quite a few problems for Man. City. His touches were inconsistent, and his hold-up play wasn't good, but I still think he put in a decent performance, individually, and a good performance for the team.

5347~~~
His pass to Valencia at one point to free him was brilliant. Fantastically weighted. Two 'average' games recently but he has a goal and an assist in them. Let's hope he actually plays well next weekend, eh? <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

5348~~~
I think so too. And I absolutely love Benzema.

5349~~~
What was laughable? Did Falcao lose the ball? Did Rooney not? Was it not unexpected? What part was laughable?

5350~~~
I don't think your posts on the matter are any more objective. Quite the opposite really.

5351~~~
Falcao did lose the ball, yes, more than once in 10 minutes for what it's worth.

To say Falcao could've done the job that Rooney did today (or did against Villa or Liverpool) is what's laughable, along with this quote...

If you think Falcao 'showed up Rooney' in anyway at all today in his superfluous 10 minute cameo, I'd question either your sanity or your integrity.

5352~~~
No chance. Hes lazy. Rooney is valuable to our high pressing game. His movement in behind is so much better than rvps, creates space for others and gives defenders something to think about.

He did score a worldy last week as well, can't remember him having a shot today.

5353~~~
He showed him up in terms of keeping the football with defenders on your back - holdup play, part of a #9's job, an incredible important part which will be minutely looked at in case he doesn't score in a game, and an area in which Rooney was at his worst today.
I didn't see the Villa game but Rooney was equally terrible vs Liverpool.

EDIT: Falcao in this form was never going to score the goal Rooney scored vs Villa.

5354~~~
Oh, and <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/829741/Live" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/829741/Live</a>

Rooney lost the ball 5 times to Falcao's 0. Whoscored - Insane and dishonest.

5355~~~
Rooney was on the pitch for 93 minutes, Falcao was on the pitch for 11 minutes when the game was already dead. Strewth . . .

5356~~~
Still want more from him. I just think the main striker at a club of our size should threaten the goal far more. He does a lot of great work for the team, but I want him to scare centre halves shitless when he picks it up, and I want him having more purposeful efforts on goal every game. The sort of return Bent eke has had in recent weeks, our main striker should be capable of that sort of stuff.

5357~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> you do realise Falcao played 7 minutes to Rooney's 90?

5358~~~
Rooney haters in force tonight. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Not to mention some insane posts.

5359~~~
Steady on. No need to take a crazy risk like that. Their posts are plenty idiotic as it is.

5360~~~
I like how you both picked his post and ignored that it was an answer to JUPITER's: "Falcao lost the ball more than once today".

5361~~~
Don't think he was shite against Villa at all, unless we have some extraordinary high standards

5362~~~
*Sigh*

Rewatch the last 10 mins, there were 2-3 times when Falcao had Mangala/Demichelis on his back but still found a pass. Rooney failed at it today. 
Am I saying Rooney should be dropped? No. Do I think Falcao would do a better job? No.
Did Falcao demonstrate a better touch in his tiny cameo? Yes. Do the stats back up what was obvious to my eyes? Yes. 
Is this something that can be pointed out? Not without being called insane and with everyones favourite green smiley being thrown around. I don't understand what people would lose by admitting that Rooney's touch was horribly off today while Falcao's (to the extent we can judge) wasn't.

5363~~~
Rooney for me summed up what was wrong with City, one of our most influencial players not doing anything outstanding but worked non stop for the full game, toure, silva stopped working after 15 minutes

5364~~~
He was overall, but that goal really "saved" him and made people think of it as a good performance. The way he's playing he should score more to afford it, I think he should do a lot better than he has done recently. It might be a bit harsh thing to say, but getting Rooney out of that midfield has really helped us. He's a striker, but he hasn't shown anything to suggest he's nearly as good a striker as he used to be (09-10, 11-12).

5365~~~
Because you aren't really comparing apples with apples. Falcao came on when the game was already dead, he was fresh, he was up against tiring defenders, and he didn't have time to do much of anything at all, good or bad.

Comparing his stats from that brief cameo against the stats of someone who played 90+ minutes isn't really fair.

But I guess we could check their season averages for the number of times per game they lose the ball through a poor touch. And it looks like this:

Rooney - 1.3
Falcao - 1.7 (the highest average in the squad)

5366~~~
FFS. I will quote myself:
Really poor <b>today</b>
Besides that his hold-up play was off <b>today</b>, he kept losing tha ball under minimal pressure and Falcao showed him up <b>on that front</b> (I don't think he lost the ball once after he came on)- <b>not a sentence I would ever expect to type.</b>
Rewatch the last 10 mins, there were 2-3 times when Falcao had Mangala/Demichelis on his back but still found a pass. Rooney failed at it <b>today</b>.

5367~~~
Our furthest man back during city's break after our corner that somehow stayed out. Can't fault the man's work ethic.

5368~~~
I don't see Rooney as an automatic first choice centre forward for Manchester United in 15/16.  He is still a good player but surely with the money that we. Are reputed to have to spend why wouldn't we get a top 5 younger CF?

5369~~~
Well, okay then. Falco didn't lose the ball in his ten minute cameo when the game was dead, and this really showed Rooney up. Just like the fact Falcao had a worse pass completion than Rooney in that ten minute cameo really showed Falcao up. Or something. Because those ten minutes are all that matter.

5370~~~
He doesn't half jump into people during celebrations... It's almost Phil Jones like!

5371~~~
Whats the point of having more pace in Rooneys advantage when he cannot hold up a ball, dribble or beat his defender infant of him? Atleast RvP can. And why stretch a defense with pace when RvP has the ability to connect and link up far better then Rooney? 

I honestly don't think the stuff Rooney is doing is more valuable then what RvP can offer us. You are judging RvP on a bad streak when he was totally out of form (everyone was including Rooney). The team is stable now, and in a stable team I believe RvP to be superior to Rooney.

The problem is more, where would Rooney play if RvP gets in. Because this midfield atm is better without Rooney.

5372~~~
If theres any striker in the world who has excellent movement its RvP. Rooney actually gets slaughtered for his bad positioning making spaces narrow by hugging others last season.

5373~~~
No extraordinary high standards but he couldn't trap a bag of cement that day. It wasn't only me who thought that but half the stand where I was watching were groaning. He did score a wonder goal though. Ps I'm not a Rooney hater I think he's our best player but his touch has been dreadful of late so let's be honest.

5374~~~
I can't recall the opponent ( i think Arsenal), but i remember a Van Persie goal last season at home where he jumped on Van Persie and it looked like his neck could break at any moment.

edit : Against Arsenal indeed, when Vermaelen made that defensive error.

5375~~~
Oy, this thing about Rooney's touch. You're talking about passes that no-one else on the pitch has to receive, because Rooney's our only striker. He gets the ball fired at him with his back to goal and a big CB breathing down his neck. That heavy touch away from the defender is how he controls the fizzed passes without getting his pocket picked. If Mata spent all game trying to field those passes, his first touch would look much less impressive too. But he doesn't, because he's the one providing them.

5376~~~
People are entitled to opinions, which you'll find will differ among a population of more than one. Certain people established that Rooney's performance wasn't great, some thought it was shit; not sure how that constitutes to hating him. The criticism is in order, as well, he hasn't be impressive over the last few games.

5377~~~
Wasn't just the goal but the fact that he kept the Villa defence occupied all game also helped, that and the "assist" for Herrera's second as well which came about because of Rooney being a nuisance. I don't think that goal would have come about if we had Van Persie playing instead of Rooney.

5378~~~
Aye... could have killed him.

5379~~~
I have maintained that RVP and Falcao have been unfairly criticized and that their poor performances is due to a lack of creativity by our central midfielders. Now Rooney is playing on top the same thing is happening to him. As much as people seem to love Mata he rarely turns and faces opponents while looking for through passes. Only Carrick seems to actively look for and delivers said through passes.
I am not going to complain too much because I just want to make the top 3 (4) and it looks like we are going to achieve it but to be honest I think we have been quite fortunate in terms of recent results considering our lack of midfield creativity.

5380~~~
Wasn't great, but he did get an assist. He works harder than RvP and Falcao though, and so for me that should keep him in ahead of them.

5381~~~
If you truly believe that then you are just incredibly pessimistic... Fortunate with recent results? The feck are you on about. We've played City, Spurs, Liverpool and Villa off the park each time.

5382~~~
Didn't have a great game but wasn't bad either, got an assist and worked hard. Hopefully this means he'll have a great game at SB.

5383~~~
Not talking about our general play just our creativity. The key point to my post was a lack of midfield creativity making our strikers, even Rooney, look poor.

5384~~~
We've created plenty of chances though in recent games... And Rooney for the most part has played well, apart from the Liverpool game. Today the chances didn't fall to him but they fell to young, mata, fellaini, Carrick even. That was a fair argument a few months back but not really anymore I don't think.... Also Rooney as he was today and against Liverpool is still better then what falcao and rvp served up. The off the ball runs, pressing, hold up play and constant battling with defenders and dragging them around is just stuff van Persie and falcao didn't do to a good level.

5385~~~
It's nothing new from him as well.

Skip to 6:10 to see what I mean. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5386~~~
Ridiculous pass

5387~~~
Funny you should say that. After today's match, I was wondering about his role in the team next year and the year after.

The midfield experiment failed, and that was supposed to be his future role. He's effective as a striker and offers many other qualities as a forward but honestly is a notch below the kind of player we want in that role. He's old enough to start experiencing a decline in his ability, pace, and fitness. We should be buying a top striker soon - what do we do with Rooney?

5388~~~
Brightonian that's his job and I'm not judging him against Mata but against Giroud, Costa, Sterling, Kane and the likes who are all playing up top through the middle. Rooney has massive other attributes on these players but when it comes to the ball sticking to him with back to goal he has been poor of late.

5389~~~
He could have died there. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5390~~~
Rooney and Kane have both scored 7 goals in their last 11 games for club and country.

Based off this, one's the new Shearer/Batistuta/Van Basten, and one is an old fart who's past his best and  possibly needs to be replaced in the summer.

And it's been this way for 5 years now with Rooney. He's been 'in decline' since he was 23.

5391~~~
Well, I don't see explosions that often anymore.

5392~~~
Yes, it's quite ridiculous.

If Rooney had been playing up top the entire season, there's no doubt that he would be challenging Kane / Costa / Aguero for the top scorer title.

5393~~~
Yeah it was an okay performance from Rooney. Another demonstration of why I prefer him to Falcao and RvP. When he's not playing well he still does the minimum things I expect of a forward, the other two don't.

5394~~~
This is just ridiculous. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Excuses for Rooney are incredible, now our midfield is bad too because they aren't feeding him with the balls, even though he can't control even half of those he gets into his feet and even though our midfield is dominating every team we are facing at the moment. Yeah, everyone is shit except Rooney. 

I blame de Gea for not playing Rooney one on one with the keeper at least once per game.

5395~~~
If Rooney plays as our default #9 next year, in a settled team, he's going to have a blistering season.

5396~~~
Well he did explode against West Ham and people wanted his head to roll following that...

Considering half your posts in this thread are calling Rooney shite, terrible, average, most uncreative player in our squad and probably a bunch of other garbage, you would be wise not to accuse anyone else of bias or making up excuses.

Probably the worst poster in the thread. But then again you were the guy who thought we were shite at Anfield...sums you up really.

5397~~~
I am not calling Rooney shite, I think he is our second or third most important important player, I just can't stand how people can be blind to his poor form. Last three games are obvious example, he is easily one of our worst players during that time yet people like you are saying he is doing fine. But yeah, I am the one who is biased.
I never said Rooney is crap or anything like that, I say from time to time that his form is crap, but he is definitely very good player in general.

Btw calling me out when the guy above said that our midfield is at fault for Rooney's poor form is just idiotic.

5398~~~
French TV pundits were raving about him yesterday. Ginola seems to be in love with him, he's in the studio for Canal + (handsome bastard) and he was going on about how if he was a coach, Rooney is the first player he'd sign. Absolutely loves him, he was explaining how his palette of skills is pretty much unique in world football. 

The commentators love him as well, and were very insistent about his importance in the team effort.

5399~~~
I agree.

5400~~~
I would like him to score before RvP gets back just so van Gaal doesn't consider moving him back to midfield.

5401~~~
David Ginola...? Haven't they heard that the experts on Redcafe have decided that Rooney was 'shown up by Falcao' yesterday!?

They clearly have a lot to learn about football!

5402~~~
Heh, Falcao has done nothing to suggest that he should start ahead of Rooney. And I don't even think Rooney played well yesterday. His all round game can still be poor for large chunks of games, and I still think we could do with a new striker, but at least unlike Falcao he's getting goals, not looking depressed and luckless, and is mobile. Rooney wins anyday right now.

5403~~~
Hmmmm this is a tricky one. For me right now the pros and the cons are even with Rooney and for the simple fact that after soooo long of not having a settled team that plays good football I would be very very hesitant to change things up. LVG obviously rates him highly and the other players have gone on record to say how well respected and important he is the to team. He works his arse off, is undoubtedly the most mobile of our strikers, and always has a reasonable/good goal return. 

However i do think that this current single striker system would also suit either Rvp or falcao as well. People have gone way too far in writing both their obituaries as valuable strikers and it is hard not to see them both doing good with the team playing this well. Posters who do not think Rooney has been poor in our last 3 games (2 of them massive matches against our two biggest rivals which is disappointing)are watching a different game to me and it consequently causes me to be curious about seeing the other two have a go instead. Just inherently don't like the idea of fcking with a winning formula though. 

There's a definite chance we could see be seeing both falcao and Rvp leave this summer and I think it would be a real shame to see two world class operators not get to properly play in this talented and newly coherent Manchester United side,

5404~~~
Surely you're not going to just look at 7 games when earlier you made a point of looking at the season stats of how many times Falcao and Rooney have given the ball away through poor touches. 

Let's look at how many goals Kane and Rooney have got through the whole season.

5405~~~
This is growing arms and legs? Where did I suggest any this? I just said he needs to be holding the ball up better than he has been for the last 3-4 games!

5406~~~
He's looking at the last 11 games. I presume this is because Rooney's played the last 11 games as a striker but wasn't beforehand.

5407~~~
The pass for Mata's goal was great, but apart from that he was poor, and has been the last few games.

Rooney being captain is a massive elephant in the room. He's no longer a world class #9, and isn't suited to playing deeper in the midfield. The next few years when he declines will be a nightmare.

5408~~~
Great idea, Rooney has spent the majority of the season in CM, and we all know that, but feck it, it'll make him look worse.

5409~~~
Kane is having a magnificent season, does Rooney *have* to catch him?

5410~~~
As long as that elephant keeps leading the herd as they stomp all over the wildebeest, rhinos and lions, it's alright by me.

5411~~~
Would still prefer him behind a new striker, i don't trust Rooney on his own for 38 games + UCL,LC and the FA Cup.

5412~~~
I thought Rooney was pretty bad yesterday but I still wouldn't even remotely consider sitting him for Falcao or RvP.

5413~~~
I'm aware of that and that was kind of my point in the first place. We can all pick and choose stats that make players look better or worse, or how we want them to look in truth. 

If we wanted to be really pedantic we could look at the stats he posted earlier of Rooney giving the ball away 1.3 times a game through poor touches and Falcao giving it away 1.7 times per match through poor touches and then say a striker is more likely to give the ball away through poor touches as he is getting ball fizzed into him and then has a huge CB baring down on him. But then I could say well, that is the job of a striker isn't it...

Again, I'm just pointing out how easy it is to manipulate stats to make players look better/worse etc.

5414~~~
Actually, I would be interested to see how many times Rooney gives the ball away per match through poor touches when he plays as a striker as opposed to a midfielder. I'd like to compare that to Falcao and see if the stats match up to what seems to be the general consensus.

5415~~~
I don't enjoy seeing Rooney's name up front as the lone striker, it makes me cringe as i don't think thats his best position, i always think he needs a SS, whenever i see his name there as a lone striker i always think its an F.A cup game as we can afford to do that in those kind of games.

Rooney playing as a lone striker this season is the only logical option, Falcao is well.... Falcao and RVP has been injured and doesn't do as much work as Rooney - at least from what we've seen this season, we have a winning system that can only accommodate 1 striker and it should be Rooney at least for the first 60 minutes.

5416~~~
2 goal and 1 assist in last 4 games. Not that bad hey.

<a class="username" data-user="69151, @Annahnomoss" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69151/">@Annahnomoss</a>  So if I'm reading that right, Rooney loses the ball more, gets dispossessed more and has a worse passing accuracy than Falcao?

5419~~~
Per game. You have to take into consideration that Falcao often plays less minutes. Then you have to take into account that Rooney has dropped down to midfield for some matches and that his passing accuracy should benefit from that etc etc.

Just statistics, if someone wants they can further refine them by turning it to "per minute" instead of per game.

5420~~~
Yeah, a per 90 minutes would be ideal. 

Either way, Falcao's seems to be in and around Rooney's which is interesting as a poor first touch and constantly being dispossessed are two criticisms constantly thrown at Falcao. Thanks for the stats.

5421~~~
If Rooney were to perform in a similar fashion to yesterday for an entire season, would we be content with him? I know I wouldn't. I appreciate his effort, determination and energy, however, he's going to have to do much more if we are to challenge on all fronts, next season.

5422~~~
No worries! I would say Falcao has quite a significant amount of more failed touches than RVP and Rooney considering he's came on very late in most matches and that counts as "one game" while he still has as many lost balls per game. 

That said Falcao averages a goal/assist every 115 minute. 
Rooney averages a goal/assist every 130 minutes. 
RVP averages a goal/assist every 166 minutes. 

As a starter Falcao has scored/assisted by far the best amount per minute of the lot with only one goal/assist coming from him as a substitute. 

So his goals/assists per minute would drastically decrease and be even more superior if we based it on starts. 

Again this doesn't mean anything except exactly what it means, it is just statistics.

5423~~~
The MNF analysis made me appreciate Rooney more so for what he did for the system (even though he only had like 35 touches).

5424~~~
He doesn't get nearly enough recognition for how disicplined and tactically astute he is. Just takes a couple of heavy touches and everyone's saying he's been crap. Good thing managers (and Neville) are more perceptive.

Not blowing my own trumpet here, by the way. I also thought he was a bit crap yesterday!

5425~~~
Neville's analysis on Rooney was amazing, I thought Rooney had an average game as well but couldn't understand the heavy criticism considering how we tore City's defence apart. Even if you're not as perceptive as Neville, and I'm certainly not, you must surely link that our front striker would have had some influence on the game beyond just the token assist and heavy touches.

5426~~~
I thought he was decent. Now, what do I win?

5427~~~
Great to see Neville talking through how good Rooney's performance against City, highlighting his tactical awareness and the importance of his positioning and running.

It was <i>really</i> bothering me seeing people under-rate his contribution to the game and to this team in general - he's so important to this system working and is playing so well up top on his own.

5428~~~
But his first touch, people!

5429~~~
Just seen the analysis too and of course you have to get Rooney credit. Though I thought Neville went a little over the top with his praise. In terms of his performance in the City game. Obviously I'm not sure but surely he's been doing what he did against City in our recent games of good form.

5430~~~
Even when Rooney has a bad game he does so much to bring the midfielders into play with the way he holds the ball and plays 1-2s. He's also often the first one to sprint back to defend on a counter. When you compare that with other strikers who tend to be a net negative when they are not scoring and its not debatable how important he is to the team.

5431~~~
He's not been great in the last two games but there's currently no justification for replacing him in the lineup with RVP, and especially not with Falcao.  He should start against Chelsea barring injury or fatigue.

5432~~~
Neville on Rooney's performance Vs City:

But Rooneys Inverse Fan Club know better. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

5433~~~
He also called Rooney's performance against City <i><b>"a silent domination"</b></i>, which I thought summed it up brilliantly.

5434~~~
Here's what I said about Rooney's performances in November:

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/wayne-rooney-2014-2015-knock-out-performances.393849/page-59#post-16733991">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/wayn...out-performances.393849/page-59#post-16733991</a>

Now, i'm not saying i've forgotten far more about Rooney's career and the finer points of his game than most of his detractors will ever know - but, well,  I have forgotten far more about Rooney's career and the finer points of his game than most of his detractors will ever know. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5435~~~
Was a very insightful summation from Neville, got to say I do enjoy MNF analysis. Must have really stuck in Carraghers throat to have to praise United's defensive set-up straight after too!

5436~~~
It's petty to brag about being right, NessunDorma...

But I too am a petty man! Here's what I said about Rooney's performance against City in the tide of criticism he was getting on here...

5437~~~
Assistant manager praising his captain and friend shocker. It's like using Jamie Jackson's article to prove that Hart is better than de Gea.

If that yesterday was Rooney's best United performance then I actually feel sorry for him.

I would think that being <i>lead striker</i> for a team like Manchester United means being lot more than just tactically excellent. Van Persie was tactically our best player in the first half of the season because he was the only one getting van Gaal's philosophy and yet we all wanted to see him dropped because he was crap, I rarely remember anyone praising him because he was <i>tactically</i> excellent. But yeah, this is Wayne Rooney we are talking about, even when he can't control the ball he is still doing great things nobody can see because who really cares about how good an attacking player is with the ball really.

5438~~~
Positional Discipline.

5439~~~
Ever since Rooney's moved up front, he's always been playing really well for the team even if his individual performances weren't up to par. His movement and work rate always gives central defenders a tough time, and it's one of the reasons why we perform as well as we do as a team. Rooney's energies are now all focused on working for the benefit of the team, and you can see that the team still plays well even if Rooney, individually, isn't playing as well.

The way he occupies the central defenders means that Mata and Fellaini can get into space and make themselves dangerous. It also allows players like Herrera to ghost into positions into the box and score goals. Not only that, but Rooney makes central defenders reluctant to charge up and try to win the ball, and if they do, then you get Mata's goal against Man. City.

Individually, for the past several matches, Rooney has been below average. For the team, however, he's been great if not world class.

5440~~~
Watch Neville's analysis again. 

It isn't biased, it's tactical insight and it's educational.

5441~~~
I still can't believe people have been comparing Falcao to Rooney. That's absurd even by the levels of madness you see in this thread.

5442~~~
Indeed. Especially when one's using specific examples from the game, and other just his opinion.

5443~~~
And it was only 9 days ago that he was doing this:

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/eButH1pzr0F/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

5444~~~
Quality player and like many of the Utd leg before him, won't realise how good he was until he's not here anymore..

5445~~~
Examples of him being tactically good? Well I can take examples of Hart's game against Barcelona and de Gea's game against Villa and say that Hart is better keeper. Where are the examples of Rooney being good at something else yesterday, like being good on the ball, something that's actually very important for attacking players? I don't remember anyone saying he was poor tactically yesterday, everyone who said he had a bad game said that his hold up play and some other important things were missing, and rightfully so. Most of our players were great at everything yesterday, great with the ball and excellent tactically, yet Rooney is the only one being praised by Neville for some/known reason even though he was probably one of our worst players in general yesterday.

5446~~~
I know its a while off, but replacing Rooney in a few years time will be one hell of a challenge. Player of his quality, same determination and grit, energy.. All on the forward line - combined with the passion of playing for United etc

5447~~~
You'll find yourself in a minority here. Most on here seem to think he's a pub footballer who's somehow scored 230 goals for us and should be replaced sooner rather than later.

5448~~~
Have faith in Wilson.

5449~~~
I can honestly see us giving him 1 year rolling contracts til he's 35 like Carrick because we're still waiting to find the perfect replacement. As much as Rooney has had his issues with the club in Fergies days, its obvious to see he loves playing for the club and his quality is so clear to see. Especially of late with our much improved performances. Rooney will always have the odd off game - but he plays for the shirt more then anybody and replacing a player combined with his quality will be hard.

5450~~~
To replace Wayne Rooney...?

No disrespect to Wilson, and I hope I'm wrong, but I don't see in him the same brilliance that Rooney had as a 19 or 20 year old.

5451~~~
No doubt, but Rooney was already scoring hatricks for United at his age. He will be a legend in 30 years time. Wilson would do well to reach 50% of what Rooney has achieved with us.

5452~~~
Anyone who would start falcao over Rooney is so deluded they should be sent to Rawk, they would for right in

5453~~~
I wonder if the Daily Mail pay Neville for stealing his MNF comments for their own website hits.

5454~~~
I'm gonna, cos I'm a petty person! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>


Ah! 
Yeah I remember us both agreeing on here. People are so focused on his 'touch', it's become an incredibly boring leitmotiv, and it was really enjoyable to watch Neville analyze the subtleties of his game. 'Silent domination' was an excellent description of it.

5455~~~
Agreed. Neville's gone completely overboard there. Most of the stuff that Rooney's doing now is something that van Persie had already been doing for van Gaal before he'd even came here and that's carried on throughout this season. It is strange that he got absolutely no credit for that. I really don't think it's ludicrous at all to suggest van Persie could perform similarly well in this team now everyone else has started to understand their role. Rooney obviously offers a level of mobility and energy that van Persie doesn't have in him any more but the positioning, movement, hold-up play and all-round understanding of the role is something van Persie is still very, very good at, and his more intelligent use of the ball compensates for his lack of mobility.

I think Rooney's been very important in the past couple of months and don't think his form warrants him being dropped at all but I also don't think there'd be a significant drop-off if van Persie was brought in. Our #9 this season has been asked to play a very selfless role and that is true of Falcao, Rooney <i>and </i>van Persie. They've genuinely had to feed on very few chances, they've had to do a lot of hard running and they've been asked to be more disciplined than any of our strikers in a long, long time. It's the kind of thing that we saw from our strikers in the odd big game where they were asked to be the focal point, the dummy runner and first line of defence and very little else, but this season they've been doing it consistently. They all could have played better individually, no doubt, but I think they've been given very little credit for a very tough role - easily the toughest role in the team, IMO.

5456~~~
Not having this by Neville what a lot of rubbish. Yes Rooney occupied the centre backs and held a more disciplined position but his touch has been dreadful for the last few games. I'm a big Rooney fan but this is a case for me of the analysis (Neville) taking this to far to suit his narrative.

5457~~~
Neville in continuing his pub level and ridiculously pro England players commentary shocker.

5458~~~
To be fair to Neville - he never specifically said that he thought Rooney had a good game, what he said was a) He's impressed that LVG had been able to manage someone like Rooney to follow his tactical approach and b) that due to how he operated EXACTLY how he was meant too tactically, that LVG would have loved his performance - which, to be fair, isn't an outlandish thing to think at all, as LVG bloody loves it when people do what he's told them to do.

5459~~~
If Neville said that Rooney played a disciplined game but needs to show more quality as an attacker, it would've been a fair assessment.  Like he typically does with England players, he went absurdly overboard with his praise.  Doing your job tactically is the minimum expectation for a player at the level we aspire to compete at in the future.

5460~~~
Our striker doing what he's told to do is nothing new, though. What he's presented there as "Rooney's best performance in a United shirt" under LvG - from LvG's perspective - is something that all three of our strikers have done before and it's barely warranted a mention.

5461~~~
I suppose it has more meaning/looks more "impressive" when everything around him is also working as it should - with Mata/Young drifting wide and Herrera and Fellaini pulling into spaces on their sides of the pitch. I agree that it's a bit OTT, but I think he's probably got a point that LVG was very happy with his performance whilst the rest of us thought he wasn't great.

To be fair to Neville again, I seem to remember him doing a peice on RVP earlier this season that he was making intelligent runs and looking for the ball in good spaces, but just not getting it... I may have totally made that up mind you.

5462~~~
Yes, that was my point from the beginning, I never said Rooney should be dropped for Falcao or van Persie, I just said I think they would be capable of playing better than how Rooney played over the last three games and they already did. Hell, I even said I don't see any point in starting Falcao at all anymore in first place, but people see what they want to see.

Btw, cheers for the rest of the post, it's easier when you have someone who is seen as someone who likes Rooney agreeing with you, because I couldn't believe people were actually falling for Neville's "Rooney's best game for Manchester United", because frankly, it's stupid, being tactically good doesn't mean you had a great game.

5463~~~
Nonsense. RvP and Falcao have never put in a shift like that under Van Gaal. Wilson might have matched the effort but wouldn't have caused the opposition as many problems on the ball.

5464~~~
RVP cannot put in a shift like Rooney though. The way continuously harasses the CBs and closes them down isn't something I can see RVP do.

5465~~~
I don't agree at all. I think that has more to do with appearances than anything else to be honest. Van Persie worked very hard in most of his games and I'm amazed anyone would criticise Falcao's work-rate. He was compared to Forlan and Tevez because of his workrate at various points. Perhaps he's gone into his shell a bit in recent times as he's lost all kind of self-belief, but there's absolutely no doubt in my mind Falcao worked every bit as hard at the start of his United career. Others seemed to agree at the time:




Since then opinions on Falcao have soured and his self-belief has hit rock bottom so all of that is quite easily forgotten, but I do think Falcao in many games this season worked as hard and as selflessly as Rooney did. He never looked fully fit but he worked his balls off.

Is there any way we can quantitatively measure the work-rate of our three strikers? I'd be very, very surprised if Rooney yesterday covered more ground than the other two at any other point this season. I didn't think van Persie's performance against Chelsea this year was any less disciplined, effective or hard-working than Rooney's against City, for example.

5466~~~
Also, can we stop this 'Rooney has spent most of the season in midfield' thing? It was the same thing unobjective people used in the Ronaldo debate, claiming he had spent years as some sort of left-winger. At a push, he started about 10-15 big games on the left when Ronaldo was here, and that's probably being generous - and off the top of my head, has probably started about 7 or 8 games max in central midfield this season.

Other than that, both while Ronaldo was here and this season, he has played as either the 9 or 10.*

*My figures have not been researched and will probably be miles off now!

5467~~~
Oxymoron?

Even if RvP and Falcao covered, blade for blade, the exact same bits of the pitch as Rooney did on Sunday they would be less effective because they're considerably slower across the ground.

Not to mention that he's a very smart, well-rounded footballer who knows which runs to make and when to make them. When we're attacking <b>and</b> when we're defending. That's why three different managers have been willing to play him in such a wide variety of different roles, something no other striker in our squad has previously shown themselves capable of.

5468~~~
So, limiting Rooney's involvement deeper on the pitch mean we play better as a team? I've been saying that for years.

5469~~~
in one of the recent games he was playing midfield, while we were all saying he was terrible the opposing manager (cant remember who it was) admitted Rooney's movement was causing them all kinds of problems

5470~~~
Persie certainly did away to Southampton. And for the surrounding period when he was 'back'. He worked his socks off at St. Mary's, won so many 50/50s, and held the ball up well under a battering from the centre-halves.

5471~~~
Rooney had to come deeper because we were worse as a team if he didn't because our midfield and organization was rubbish in comparison to what it is now.

5472~~~
I was impressed by Rooney's contribution on Sunday, and, at the end of the game, I wanted to point out to my mates how he gave such an understated, but brilliant performance.

Might have been a tad too inebriated though; ended up struggling to find the right words, and only mumbled something about "fecking Cavani".

5473~~~
That Southampton performance stands out as a shining light in a sea of mediocrity, going back 18 months or so. Van Persie did play very well in that game and got unanimous praise for doing so. I guess the point being made here is that Rooney can be below par (as he was on Sunday) yet still put in an incredibly hard-working and effective performance. When Van Persie isn't on his game he's a passenger. Just seems to stop trying.

5474~~~
I wouldn't think so. The intensity of Rooney's pressing is a little bit higher, sure, but the analysis Neville did showed most of Rooney's work was not done at sprinting pace or anywhere near it. It was just about understanding your role, where to be at all at times and having the discipline to stick to it. Van Persie has done that very well all season. He's just lacked the finishing touch and quality on the ball to take it from being a good #9 performance to a great one. The same is true of Rooney at the weekend.

Honestly, I'm surprised that so few others agree that absolutely everything he said about Rooney there is everything that van Persie has done both this year and at the World Cup. The same is true of your description of Rooney there - the only difference being that versatility, but this role requires the least versatility of any attacker. You're forced to stay as the focal point of the attack, occupy the two centre backs, bring others into play and stretch the defence. Van Persie'sdone that all season. That's been the reason he's been a van Gaal favourite.

As AN said earlier, Neville actually did a very similar piece of analysis for van Persie against the very same opponent. All that stuff that he showed earlier for Rooney - <a class="externalLink" href="https://youtu.be/ewFBzMk-w3Y?t=64" target="_blank">occupying Kompany to create space for Fellaini</a>, <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewFBzMk-w3Y" target="_blank">pushing the centre backs further and further back to create space for the midfield runners</a> - it's right there with van Persie too, as you can see in the clips. That is what he's done all season. The service he was receiving was just not good enough, and that's something that Neville acknowledged at the time during his only criticism. You could quite easily find a clip showing Rooney doing exactly the same thing on Sunday. The difference is the narrative. He's playing up to the United euphoria and praising England's talisman.

They're doing the same thing. It's just Rooney's being utilised better because we're playing better. The biggest part of that is we now have Carrick and Herrera in there too and they just use the ball much, much better going forward. Carrick and van Persie have a great partnership but have barely had a chance this season to play together, and with Herrera now added into the mix and our entire team in sync it's hardly a leap to say that van Persie would be playing much better.

Perhaps it's true that Rooney is the better number #9 when we're not playing well but now that we are playing well, I firmly believe van Persie will fit in very nicely.

5475~~~
This. I feel like people are grasping at straws here. Rooney is out best striker hands down, and i would not switch him for any of our other strikers currently, but claiming he had "a great game" vs City seems absurd to me. His touch was heavy and he looked like he was on the back foot pretty much the whole game. He should start vs Chelsea this weekend, but i hope he delivers more than he did on Sunday

5476~~~
Good post, and I agree. Rooney also has the benefit of having a lot more room to move into. I don't think we've played RvP as a sole #9 this season, without having Rooney or Falcao up beside him, thereby limiting the space he can move into. RvP in the current set up would do really well, imo.

I also think he'd hold the ball up better, in the final third.

5477~~~
While I agree that this type of role will fit RVP better, I'm not really convinced that he has the fitness left in him anymore to make him a viable option. That lone role is a hugely demanding one that involves making run after run that no-one ever sees and spending the whole game being double teamed by the opposition centre backs. If he can show he does have the vitality left in him to keep troubling centre backs for 90 minutes for an extended run of games then there's a debate to be had, but he's looked very heavy legged to me for a lot of this season.

5478~~~
He's looked a shadow of his usual self. Heavy legged but also seeming to lack the strength (or desire?) for any of the physical battles. Far too easily shrugged off the ball and not winning near enough of his share of headers.

5479~~~
Agreed. I said this is another thread I think but at least two of our recent goals, one against Villa and the winner at Newcastle, we simply would not have scored had it been RvP playing instead of Rooney. He just does not press and harry defenders like that. High pressing is a very important tactic in the modern game, both offensively and defensively, and Rooney does it very well.

5480~~~
I must concede that I think Rooney has become the best option for us now. While I think Persie is the better and more talented individual, Rooney bridges the gap, and then some, with his physical superiority.

Ultimately, I still think we need a better contribution than any of our strikers give us to take the step to being one of the most dangerous sides in Europe. A striker who can go on a scoring run, frighten defenders, and win games on their own would be fantastic. Heaven knows who though!

5481~~~
We need Rooney in the team this season (as a striker), we don't need him to be a star though, don't think he is capable of being a star anymore.

5482~~~
He's not disciplined or tactically astute though, and he's becoming so now, which is what surprised and impressed Neville. Long may it continue.

5483~~~
Not consistently over a season anyway. He still has moments though. And could string a good stretch of games together.

5484~~~
Yes, a formidable team with quality players in a system that works is better than a team filled with Stars IMO.

5485~~~
Thought Neville's analysis was spot on. Rooney's positional play was excellent. These things don't show up in stats.

5486~~~
I like others have complained loudly when Rooney's dropping back into midfield constantly. He did his job well yesterday and we won/played well because of it. Deserves praise for that. Looks to be having a positive effect on the squad too,who aren't playing like they need to rely on Rooney all the time.

5487~~~
Ya, as Gazza said...."silent domination" <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

5488~~~
Silent domination meaning he done what the boss told him to? People are reading way too much into Gary Neville's analysis. The same guy who lambasted de gea after one mistake against Spurs a couple of years back yet people took what he said as gospel. A striker playing up top alone doing the minimum requirement that he was asked to is now his best match in a United shirt? Unreal. Imagine he actually played well.

5489~~~
I think Gary was clearly over the top in some of his comments. However some of the things he said do have value. I think Rooney has started playing with some tactical discipline to his game, and the examples Neville talked about were true.

5490~~~
Yeah.... no this is false. He has always been one of the most disciplined players we have had. How many strikers in Europe have had the skillset to play anywhere along the front line and have a significant role in the build up play, <i>while </i>racking up goals? (Yes, Messi and Ronaldo are not included here)

5491~~~
We can't have every striker as good as Falcao, it'd be too unfair.

5492~~~

5493~~~
I've never seen this video. I think it was on youtube but Sky must have taken it down because of how bad gary looked in it.

5494~~~
Never liked what he used to say about De Gea -- don't remember much lambasting thou -- and also Gary is full of it concerning diving.

Spot on on Monday though. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

5495~~~
Yeah, some fans are still hooked on his poor disciplinary record many years ago.

5496~~~
Was it even really bad? Just checked, and in his United career he has 84 yellows, 2 reds via second <span style="text-decoration: line-through">red</span> yellow, and just a single straight red card (West Ham). That's not that bad, I'd say. 474 appearances.

Naughtier for England. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

5497~~~
Yeah, the media pretty much made him look like the devil, doesn't help that he has a boxing background and he looks like a hobo.

5498~~~
feck yeah! This should be played in the dressing room before the Chelsea match - United are rampaging back.

5500~~~
So insipirational.

5501~~~
<i><b>Wayne Rooney</b>'s team talks have been a source of inspiration before recent wins over Tottenham and Liverpool, and before United took on Manchester City on Sunday, the Reds skipper told <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/programme" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">United Review</a> about his motivating speeches...</i>

<b>Louis van Gaal said recently about your pre-match team talks before the wins over Tottenham and Liverpool. Do you enjoy that part of being captain?</b>I've always been quite vocal in the dressing room before games and I felt at the time it was right for me, after we’d lost to Arsenal in the cup, to put a few points across to the players which I thought might help the team. I’m not saying that’s why we won the games against Tottenham and Liverpool! [Laughs] But it certainly didn’t cause any harm doing it. It just felt like the right time for me to say something.
<b>
<b>So your dressing room speeches can be quite impromptu?</b></b>
Yes, it’s not something I do before every game. I’m always talking in the dressing room and giving my opinions to try to help the players get ready for the game, but on those occasions it was just something a bit different and something I felt was right to do.
<b>
<b>How does it feel when you hear comments like Ander Herrera saying you are the epitome of everything United is about as a club?</b></b>
It’s nice to hear but it’s not just me who speaks in the dressing room, there are a few of us. The most important thing is that the team keeps winning – that’s all everyone is focused on.
<b>
<b>Our record in big matches has been excellent this season – why is that?</b></b>I think we’ve been very well prepared going into those games. We put a lot of work and effort into making sure we’re in the right shape and set up in the right way to
play those matches and that’s obviously helped us a lot because we’ve done quite well in them.
<b><b>
<b>Does it work in our favour, then, that we’ve got to face such high-profile opponents during the run-in?</b></b></b>
I don’t think you can ever say that really because they’re always tough games. We have Chelsea away, Everton away, Arsenal at home…they’re hard matches. We just have to make sure we’re ready and fully prepared for them and hopefully we can pick up maximum points.
<b><b>
<b>What’s changed in the last month or so for everything to click into place?</b></b></b>
I think the performances have been coming. We’ve been getting better and, certainly over the last few games, people have seen that we’re playing good football, creating chances and controlling matches. If we continue to play like that I think it will be difficult for any team against us.
<b><b>
<b>How important is it to not only secure Champions League football, but also setting a marker down for next term?</b></b></b>
It’s important of course, but we have to take each game as they come and win the match that’s in front of us so we can try to end the season with the biggest points tally we can get and finish as high as we can in the table. That’s the main aim.

5502~~~
I'd actually like to see stats for other lone strikers in the league.

Per game over season

Rooney - Unsc Touches = 1.3, Dispossessed = 1.8, Passing = 84.3%
Costa - Unsc touches = 2.8, Dispossessed = 2.1, Passing = 76.5%
Giroud - Unsc touches = 1.8, Dispossessed = 1.9, Passing = 67%
Aguero - Unsc touches = 1.9, Dispossessed = 2.6, Passing = 85%
Kane - Unsc touches = 2, Dispossessed = 2.7, Passing = 75.1%

Not sure if you intend you show your biased against Rooney but you can't compare Rooney over a 6 game run and then our other Strikers over a season.

Anyway, think this shows Rooney probably gets some unflair stick over his touches and passing. Maybe it's because we set the bar quite high for him, maybe it's because we're want to still see him doing a million things with energy like 8 years ago, but he's a quality player for us. 

Ofcourse he's going to lose the ball more than most, he's playing as a lone striker in the final 3rd of the pitch. He's got two central defenders on him, and possibly a defensive midfielder. Not to mention when the ball gets to that area of the pitch, everything is a little bit quicker, pressure gets that more intense. He's going to have quiet games, he's going to have games where he loses the ball alot, but that's the position. Fact is with looked better than we ever have all season him playing that position, not because of his on the ball work, but he's actually offers some movement and work up front. I really do think some people still have a grudge against Rooney for his contract sagas, or some people hold him to a crazy high standard and will nitpick at everything, but every time i come in this thread it seems his best games are average, his average games are his worst and if he does have a bad/quiet game, hell he's no longer the guy to play upfront for us and should be replaced next season...

5503~~~
Nice Stats <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>!!

I do think at times Wayne is a victim of his own versatility.  If he is not doing *everything* then he did not do enough.  Like Neville said he did his job against City keeping the two CB occupied.  Push Fellaini up and have the rest of the midfield making runs... and City couldn't handle the pressure <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>.

As for him being undisciplined, I think some of his actions in the past could easily be perceived that way.  Throw in Gary basically confirming that historically... well I won't be arguing.  Although I do think his red this year mark a turning of the page.

5504~~~
Rooney hasn't played as a lone striker all season and I started counting since the team started clicking - in benefit of Rooney.

Rooney has played 11 out of 28 games as a central forward. He has more games as a central midfielder with 12 and then 4 as an attacking central midfielder.

Why the feck would you compare the passing percentage of a central midfielder with strikers and then use it to claim he's a better striker? Central midfielders are also less likely to be dispossessed and suffer from unsuccessful touches.

Carrick has been dispossessed 0.1 time per game in average and he 0.3 unsuccessful touches and Carrick/Herrera/Blind all have a passing accuracy of roughly 90% as our midfielders. So it is a lot easier to rack up these statistics from a central midfield than as a lone striker.

5505~~~
He's always struck me as more in line with the description Neville mentioned, despite the exaggeration on his part, of a "street footballer". Someone who will leave his position to go get the ball. Someone who is all action, which has its huge benefits and flaws. A bit like Gerrard who was a great player but maybe not the <i>most</i> discipline. That's why Neville was championing the change lvg has brought about. Why else would he single Rooney out when others are also following lvgs instructions to the tee.? He seemed to believe that with Wayne it's a bigger achievement to get him to do that. I agree with him, to an extent.  Not that I'm saying that rooney is <i>ill</i> disciplined or anything.

5506~~~
Yeah those stats are indeed misleading. Even so I'd imagine Rooney would have a better pass completion percentages in other seasons too because he likes to get involved in popping it about and is usually a second striker as opposed to the others who play right up top mostly and hence less likely to get into short passing interchanges.

5507~~~
I never said he's a better striker, I just compared to him to other strikers. The biggest complaint about Rooney on here seems to be about how much he loses the ball, through bad pass or poor touch. Just outlining that against other top strikers in the league, he's got similar stats. Fair enough he's played as Central Midfield, but he's doing a job there and we all know that not his natural role, more Van Gaal trying to shoehorn him in alongside RVP/Falcao.

You can say his stats are distorted to the variety number of positions he plays. How ever if you look at his stats over the last 5 years, he's in line with other players in his position. If you take 5 years, according to whoscored he's only had 1.1 bad touches per game and only dispossessed 2.2.

Point still remains though, i think Rooney gets unfair stick on here.

5508~~~
Games can pan out where the strikers will not receive possession for prolonged periods, so you only have a few chances to do something with the ball. RVP may have had a better touch in the final third but what he does after that was next to nothing. His off the ball contribution was terrible, his positioning and movement is so easy to read from defenders, he takes too long on the ball and his ability to compete with defenders is bordering on laziness. 

Shooting, technique, goal instinct, first touch he may have the better of Wayne in those departments but that not all you need to warrant a place in the team. What displaced Rooney from striker to midfielder was RVPs sharpness and awareness to see chances from a mile off in Ferguson last season. The difference is now, he has lost that ability and no longer influences the games like he used to. 

For Rooney, I think for me the Liverpool game was really his only worst game out of the last few because he was not trying to make it difficult for the defenders and I think he was over thinking things a bit too much which does creep into his games at times. But as a team player and his selfless attitude, I don't think there's many better. He has the qualities of a number 9 (<i>not quite on the level of RVP</i>) and a number 10 and I think that the players around him respond to that as opposed to RVP's orthodox Striker mentality where the team should service him at any given moment.

5509~~~
- One of the players to have played almost every single minute of all of our recent good performances including some very tough opponents
- Has been a handful and kept the center-backs busy despite playing as a single striker up front
- Has scored quite a few and assisted a few
- Has been praised by the manager as well as team mates and also has been a worthy captain with his captaincy again been widely praised
- Has provided better quality up front compared to the other strikers and links up better with our other forward players

But this being caf we are all very objective and we still find enough to complain about. One okay performances and if the response here is not 'Sell him and buy someone better' then its a begrudging 'has been average and wouldn't mind if he is benched'. I think our expectations when it comes to Rooney are not in the right place. Manager after manager has persisted with him as our key player up front but obviously they all do it because we have to sell the shirts. If RAWK is one extreme of supporting the players we are the other one (or at least in Rooney's case). Either its the bad first touch, or the fact that he only passes to the right side, or the fact that he only scores goals and assists but does nothing else, or because he shouted at someone for defending badly. Welcome to the Rooney thread.

5510~~~
Rooney must be the most discussed player in the team/league.

5511~~~
I think he should have actually done a bit more because from the looks of it, Herrera is the deeper cm, and Rooney's doing the Herrera role.

We've not seen the sort of interplay on the right side that we've grown accustomed to these past weeks.

5512~~~
Very rarely plays a forward pass. Always spraying it sideways which is a problem with him in midfield, his failure to spot runs. Done decent enough otherwise. Hopefully back upfront next week.

5513~~~
I thought he was good, one of our better players today IMO.

5514~~~
Felt he was average today, again. but hey, that's just me.

Should have scored though, no doubt that!

5515~~~
Rarely links up with our main striker when he plays midfield. No one-twos, no dummies and rare if any through passes.

5516~~~
This is the problem for me. His first instinct is always to open his body up and play it wide.

5517~~~
Had a good game and the kept the ball ticking. He and Herrera did a pretty good job of covering for Carrick.

5518~~~
It slows us down too often on the attack, and Chelsea were happy to let us dominate because we rarely played anything towards the box.

5519~~~
I liked how he was taking the ball on the half turn most of the time and getting us going straight away, but his lack of variety in passing is why he's not a CM, but his defensive discipline was again good and he was often there helping Herrera. Shame he didn't bury that cut back from Shaw in the first half, it was a good chance by his standards.

5520~~~
He had a good enough game but he needs to go up top next week. It's a pity that game is Goodison where he'll be useless.

5521~~~
Chelsea sat back which allowed Rooney and Herrera plenty of the ball, problem is they did little with it where it mattered.

5522~~~
His miss could have changed the entire complexion of the game, and then missed another golden opportunity, from the corner.

Don't think he was bad, but not that good, either. Average performance, worsened by the missed chances.

5523~~~
Great goal. Pretty average performance... he's just not a midfielder.

5524~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

5525~~~
The header wasn't easy. Probably expected the defender to clear it. That shot at the start though. Ugh, if that went in...

5526~~~
That finish from the edge of the area. Superb finish, I was celebrating for about 5 minutes.

5527~~~
De Gea, though! If only...

5528~~~
Yeah, I thought it went in as well - as did de Gea!

But I agree with you, he's not a midfielder.

5529~~~
Golden opportunity from a corner<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You do love criticizing him for missing difficult chances. I'll give you that.

5530~~~
Thought he did well under the circumstances, would have liked LvG to go for the bold move and replace Falcao for AdM then move someone back into defensive midfield support to allow Rooney to move up the top. We had nothing to lose as a team at that point by conceding another goal at the risk of scoring one … <i>but LvG might have felt he had personally</i>. 

That's something I must admit do hear creeping into his pressers lately that could be a little worrying … "a manager thinks this way because that is how he is remembered" or "as a manager trophies are what is important, not CL places" just sayin'

5531~~~
Thought he did a good job in midfield today, especially in the first half when he was able to get into dangerous areas.

5532~~~
He's not a midfielder and it showed. Touch, passing and positioning just aren't there when he plays further back.

Not his fault though.

5533~~~
Oh sorry, it was an incredibly hard chance. Did well to get his head on to it.

5534~~~
Forgot to add that you love your strawman's as well. Never change.

5535~~~
Why is it hard for you to just accept he wasn't great today?

Had that been Falcao, this place would be on fire. Why do the standards change with Rooney? 

He missed two good fecking chances in a game where we knew we weren't going to get many, and we didn't. Cost us points.

5536~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5537~~~
You know you've accomplished something by humouring someone. Thanks, buddy.

5538~~~
TBH I thought he did an ok job in midfield today. Should have absolutly buried that chance in the first half though, but having said that I though he did a good job.

5539~~~
Glaringly obvious that he isn't a midfielder now. Needs to be up front and we'll see the true player he is.

5540~~~
There you go. Another strawman. 

He should have probably buried the first one but the 2nd is a difficult and certainly not a golden chance by any stretch. You do love exaggerating and then using that to have a go at Rooney.

And I thought he was good today even taking into account the missed chance.

5541~~~
I actually thought he did well in midfield today. Wasn't the hardest of games though considering how Chelsea were happy to let him have the ball.

5542~~~
Did better than usual in midfield. 2 tough chances which he missed. Loves the long diagonal.

5543~~~
To be honest, what I highlighted and laughed at, you're right with that line. Just the other way around.

5544~~~
Strawman in your eyes, buddy.

If that's an acceptable or good performance, then you've low standards. In case you forgot, we lost and weren't that close to winning. Our best chance fell to Rooney and he fluffed it.

I don't hate Rooney, nor would I criticise a player for no reason. You, for some reason or another, seem to be incapable of seeing any bad in his performances, and just because someone else does, you insult them.

I called his performance average as he did nothing out of the ordinary, never created a chance, hardly passed forward and missed two good chances (the header was a free one against a team who rarely concede from set pieces; golden opportunity in my eyes). However, I also recognise the good in Rooney's performances, he kept the ball under pressure and kept it ticking. However, I expect more from a player who I rate quite highly. If you're going to resort to name calling, then please don't respond.

5545~~~
Played well, saying otherwise would be farcical.

5546~~~
Think a few people had already decided he'd had a poor game before a ball was kicked today.

I don't like him in midfield at all usually but he did well today. Annoying that we miss chances in a game of few opportunties but on his weaker foot with that many bodies in front of him it was hardly a sitter.

5547~~~
Good post. Agree with pretty much all of it. Ignore akash - his contributions in this thread are abysmal.

5548~~~
Shame the early shot didn't go in we would have won this with ease (forcing Chelsea to come out). I dont like him in midfield and that 30 yard floater he tends to always play annoys the shit out of me even when it finds a wide man.

5549~~~
What the feck are you talking about?



Point to me where I said, it was an incredibly hard chance? Or point to me where I said he was great? Or maybe you can point to me where I insulted you perhaps?

And no, it was a good performance considering he's not an actual midfielder. Had it been Rooney who had given away a pass like Herrera I know what this thread would have been full off. It certainly wouldn't be full of praise to put it lightly. Wonder what you thought of Herrera's performances. Not average I take it?

You make up something. Argue against something no one has said. And then throw a hissy fit. Rinse and repeat.

Quite easily the worst poster on this thread and possibly the site. Your Rooney posts are somewhat tame compared to the shit you spout in the CE forum. At least the Orton guy just dislikes Rooney. You have to resort to coming up absolute bollocks.

5550~~~
Thought he did really well today. Should've scored that chance though.

5551~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69862, @akash02" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@akash02</a> - You seem really upset. Why don't you get offline and relax for a while? It's embarrassing watching you post nonsense after nonsense without much thought.

5552~~~
Runs a lot in midfield so he tired quite a bit towards the end, which is a shame. He would probably need to learn how to conserve his energy if he was going to play in midfield more regularly but hopefully he will be back up front with Blind coming back (LvG said him and Jones weren't too far away for this game).

5553~~~
Playing Wayne in midfield is a double problem: you miss a proper striker and lack a bit in midfield. However, LvG seemed to have no option but to play Rooney instead of Carrick/Blind.

5554~~~
Thought he did alright, nothing special though. Pressured their midfield. Was tidy overall. It's painfully obvious it's not for him though - it's just unfortunate Van Gaal had no other option.

Hopefully Carrick or Blind will be back for the next game.

5555~~~
I'm fairly calm mate. Just pointing out how embarrassing some of your posts are in the forum. No offense.

5556~~~
Accomplished centre-forward puts in so-so performance as a defensive midfielder.

It's a testament to his talent that a manager as good as LvG even thinks he can play there.

Looked the most likely to score, but meh . . . he's not a f*cking defensive midfielder.

5557~~~
lol 'fairly calm'. 

Ok - continue swearing at reasoned posters making reasoned arguments. It'll serve you well, I'm sure.

5558~~~
He had a decent game, he didn't play as a DM though, that was Herrera

5559~~~
Yeah, I don't think anything you type can be described as reasoned...

Now if only you hadn't started any of it by getting personal...oh well. So much for reasoned arguments lol

5560~~~
A free header against a team that rarely concede from set pieces is in your eyes a difficult chance? The wonder goal Rooney scored against Villa was a difficult chance, the header today was easy as feck. How you see it any other way, I don't understand.

Good performance? Zouma is a defender and performed really well, for his team. In contrast, Rooney, who's played in midfield enough to know the basics, wasn't good, at best an average performance. Have you forgotten that we lost the game.

You're an odd poster, you are. In another thread you post this "That's twice Van Gaal has had 70% of the ball against Mourinho and lost whilst barely creating anything". Yet call Rooney's performance good, for creating f*ck all, all game... I have no clue what your ridiculously low standards for Rooney are, but I expect him to perform better than today, especially, if Blind and/or Carrick don't return, otherwise, we'll find ourselves in a position we don't want to be in.

Herrera out shone our Captain whilst playing as a DM for the first time in the EPL. FWIW, I gave Rooney a 5/10 and Herrera a 6/10, which illustrates what I thought of their performances.

The last part is funny because you failed to realise that my comment about the chance being incredibly hard was tongue in cheek, and then proceeded to throw a strop for your shortcomings.

5561~~~
Said already somewhere,today think he broke that triangle on the right side,never worked who it should from very start.Its not his fault for that nor he had bad game just he could not do Herrera`s role today imo,still i understand and dont have any issues.

5562~~~
Well okay . . . but still, Rooney is not a midfielder by trade. Herrera is. And Herrera, who I rate very highly, wasn't too great himself.

Just saying that it's unfair to lambast Rooney for not being great in a position that isn't his.

As I said in the pre-match thread, Rooney should have continued up front, AdM in Fellaini's place, and Fellaini in Carrick's place.

Do actually think we played quite well today, and who am I to question Van Gaal, but  . . . we'd have been more dangerous with Rooney as a centre forward.

5563~~~
What? He was probably our best player behind Shaw.
Also I already said, he (Rooney) had a decent game. Fellaini in Carricks place would have been a disaster.

5564~~~
Not a huge fan of him in Midfield but can see why we went down that route today.

We could really do with Carrick or Blind back next week though so we can get him back up front.

5565~~~
And those few simple, cross field, misplaced passes straight to Chelsea players were quite dangerous.

5566~~~
He did a very good job in midfield for us today, we all know his best position is up front but we really needed him back there today to keep things ticking over.

5567~~~
See this is the thing, he misplaced two passes all game but apparently didn't have a good game. Rooney gave the ball away in midfield twice too, one which led to a Chelsea counter, but apparently you choose to ignore that... right.

Most passes, most interceptions, best pas accuracy, but two mis placed passes mean he had a poor game?
I actually wasn't critising Rooney, I said he had a good game, but what is this nonsesne about Herrera not having a good game about?

5568~~~
Oh right. All I said is he Herrera 'wasn't too great himself'.

In the context of Herrera playing in midfield as a midfielder, and Rooney playing in midfield as a striker.

In know which one is getting the most stick, despite that context.

5569~~~
Herrera also played out of position btw (but yes he is a midfielder and Rooney isn't)
He still played better than Rooney, I'm not even giving Rooney stick, if you want to stick up for Rooney then do so, but why bring Herrera into it (one of our better players today for that matter too)
If you want a midfielder who didn't have a good game today, who is actually a midfielder, look no further than Fellaini.. who you say should have played inplace of Carrick... <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

5570~~~
I am not upset by his missed chances. That's the life of a goalscorer. What I do not like is his apparent lack of connectivity with our (other) strikers. He rarely passes to RVP or Falcao and as a striker himself he should know what type of passes they want. I am not expecting a link up on the scale of Cole and Yorke but God Almighty can we not at least have a few one-twos once in a while?
I wonder if during training if the strikers do not work on plays between themselves. Especially with the lack of creativity of our central midfielders I would think Rooney, RVP and Falcao would get together and work on some plays together.

5571~~~
I'm sure hes got quite a few assists by passing to RVP over the past few seasons...

5572~~~
Yes, good performance and I'm sick of explaining why. He's not a midfielder (unlike Herrera) for a start. He passed the ball well (just checked 93% pass completion) and kept the ball ticking against the likes of Fabregas and co. That's pretty good going in my view. 

As for the creativity point, that wasn't directed at this game in particular. Even the game at Anfield, we created about 2 chances in the entire game despite controlling it. It's a general problem that we could and should improve upon especially from the wide areas. Rooney's not all that creative from deeper positions as he's more of an instinctive passer which suits more of a #10 role rather than a #8.

My shortcomings? Not at all. Maybe if you stopped accusing me of saying things I never said..

5573~~~
You're free to read my contributions to the Herrera thread. Never criticised the boy, and have praised him lavishly. That's because I rate him highly.

Just saying, though, that Rooney was probably slightly better - even WhoScored ratings, which as everyone knows are infallible, put Rooney ahead of Herrera - than Herrera. And I know which one is getting the most stick, even though one was playing out of position, and one wasn't.

But in the popular imagination,  Herrera is the little brilliant cute Spanish boy band bastard, and Rooney is the fat scouse ogre.

Do the math.

5574~~~
Not sure about that but  even so look at the games this season. There is very little interaction I really wonder what do these guys work on in training?
When was the last time you saw Rooney involved in a one-two with a striker or even a nice dummy play? Those are the kind of moves that unlock tight defences.

5575~~~
They were both playing out of position, granted Rooney more so.
I don't get the reference to whoscored (who cares about their ratings system), I can only say from what I watched he was better than Rooney, that no criticism of Rooney though, I thought he had a decent game (Rooney that is)
Also 2 misplaced passes, from a player who played the most passes, had the most touches and had the highest passing accuracy means that most other players played more misplaced passes, unless they just wernt getting on the ball as much. So what whoscored marked Herrera down for I'm not too sure.
Anyway since you seemed to think Rooney was playing as a defensive mid today, I'm just going to take what you say with a pinch of salt..

5576~~~
Yeah . . . i'll admit I wasn't able to watch the game properly, due to child care responsibilities. Rooney was still in midfield though, and out of position. You yourself admit that he was more out of position than Herrera, and was generally okay.

What's our disagreement again?

5577~~~
You're right about the last point, but that is not really Rooneys game tbh which is a shame
With regards to passing to other Strikers, you seem to forget he was our top assister last season.

5578~~~
That Herrera wasn't that great and had a better game I guess.
Originally the only thing I did was point out that you were wrong about Rooney playing as a DM

5579~~~
Rooney will always be top in stats. Free kicks, corners last year etc but when you look at the actual games there really is very little interaction between him and his fellow strikers or even when he plays midfield. It would not be that big a problem if the highly touted Mata and Herrera would actually create more for our strikers but they seem more interested in their own scoring.
I am happily surprised with how well we are doing right now but next year, with CL football, our level of creativity has to greatly improve.

5580~~~
Why? You want him to try to pass the ball through a mou bus? That's a counter waiting to happen.

5581~~~
He just tends to do it all the time, it's so predictable and when he finds a man (usually Valencia or Young) the ball is so slow and expected the opposition are waiting for it. I mean it's not like he throws a 30 yard ball over the top and sends either of them on the break, the ball is usually brought down dead and just passed into midfield.

5582~~~
10 points for Gryffindor

5583~~~
When I'm saying he did well in midfield I'd think that would be the consensus - I hate him there! I thought his worst traits were suppressed today -- only gave the ball away twice needlessly, handled pressure well, passed short mostly, curbed his diagonals to an extent, and didn't foul pointlessly.

5584~~~
He did a job in midfield.

Thats all what you could expect

5585~~~

5586~~~
Pretty pretty good yesterday.

5587~~~
2014/15 2 (out of 6)
2013/14 4 (out of 21)
2012/13 4 (out of 13)

5588~~~
There's no space to break when a bus has been well and truly parked. The problem is our wingers can't do anything with a ball so it looks like a fruitless exercise. Give those balls to hazard and he's taking the fullback to the cleaners, give it to young and its recycled to midfield. You can't blame him for our wingers being inept. He found fellaini was some good balls in the channels, and he himself didn't do too much with the balls.

5589~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5590~~~
I thought that was probably his best midfield performance for us this season tbh. We missed him upfront massively though.

5591~~~
He played fine in midfield, but not playing him upfront totally ruins us in terms of breaking teams down, and creating holes for people to run into.
Van Gaal needs to address this because we can't have a couple of injuries completely dictate how we play.

5592~~~

5593~~~
Thought he was very good, crisp, sharp intelligent use of it in the centre of the field, a couple of unnecessarily sprayed missiles off target but otherwise, don't see how we could have asked for more.

5594~~~
Didn't understand this move by LVG, pretty disappointed about that to be honest - if Herrera was the one destined for the Carrick role (which he clearly was), there was really no need to play Rooney in midfield. He did nothing there that any other midfielder couldn't do, and almost all of his strengths were not being used. It also had the knock-on effect of forcing Falcao to start; I don't think anyone will be surprised at how that went. 
Here's hoping Rooney's back up top next week.

5595~~~
Which other midfielder could've played instead?

5596~~~
Poor phrasing perhaps; what I meant was that another player playing as a midfielder could have performed that role. Valencia, Di Maria, even Mata could have played as a slightly more advanced CM to Herrera. The right-sided triangle had been disrupted anyway, so I suppose the only question (for Mata/Valencia) is whether the number 9 was a more or less important position not to disrupt than RB and RW. I'd say it was more important to us creating opportunities than the other two, and also that our backups for those positions were more capable of replacing them than Falcao with Rooney.

5597~~~
we do have moyes to credit for that.

again, it almost seems like some of the best things moyes did happened after he had left (mata, fellaini, rooney)

5598~~~
Don't think he deserves any credit for Fellaini and Mata though, for all we know Fellaini might have still been crap this season and the Rooney deal was more about the big boys than Moyes - don't think Moyes had that much pull to spearhead a blockbuster deal for Rooney or convince him to stay.

5599~~~
oh jeez. so now that fellaini is doing good, he's no longer moyes' fault - in fact, he can't be given credit for it either? it doesn't work like that.

and of course moyes deserves credit for rooney staying - rooney said so himself.

5600~~~
I don't see how he deserves credit for Fellaini when he signed him as a star player for Everton and turned him into ......well you saw him last season, we were actually linked to Fellaini when Fergie was still around, Moyes just ensured that we overpaid for him.
Mata was signed by Ed Woodward.

300k a week would not have happened under Fergie, so of course Rooney would thank the Small time manager who let him have his way.

Not trying to hate on Moyes, I just don't see how he deserves any credit(been hearing this ever since Fellaini turned his fortunes around) for our players playing the way they were supposed to play in the first place, how about Fellaini deserves credit for his form this season ?

Rooney signed his deal in February ( when the board had allegedly agreed to wait for Moyes to mathematically fail to qualify for the CL so they could sack him), all he had to do at that point was smile for the cameras, he rejected a 20m bid from Chelsea....BIG DEAL, who the feck was going to sell Rooney for 20m to CHELSEA in the first place, would have been sacked before the season started had he accepted that bid.

5601~~~
I dont have time to reply to this because I want to take a nap and typing bores me, but again, Rooney credited Moyes for keeping him at United. There is no way around that. If you dont accept that, then there is literally nothing else anyone can say that can change your mind because clearly it's already made up.

One again, Moyes was instrumental in keeping Rooney at United. He mended relationships for Rooney at the club. Both Rooney and Moyes have said as much and I believe Fergie may have said something to that effect as well.

5602~~~
We know David, we know.

<span style="font-size: 15px"><i>"<b>Chelsea were close to taking him</b>," Moyes told The Sunday Times.

"Jose Mourinho was interested but we wouldn't do any business. <b>I had to fight to make sure he stayed</b> - and was at the heart, again, of what Manchester United were going to be moving forward."</i></span>

5603~~~
fergie saying something along the lines of its up to moyes if he wants him. moyes admitted he thought Fellaini would be our frank lampard, to make it even more of a calamity on moyes' head.

5604~~~
Jeez. You know what? Yes, I was wrong. So were Moyes and Rooney. You keyboard warriors have the vantage point of a high horse most of us dont have in our stables.

fecking hell.

Not everything Moyes did was terrible. Like any other human being he did a few good things, and Rooney was definitely one of them.

5605~~~
Enjoy your nap, maybe when you wake up you can actually find a single quote to back your argument, or maybe you won't as you stated "typing bores you".

Are we going to give Kenny Dalglish credit for Suarez winning the Player of the year award?

5609~~~
"Rooney’s initial mindset was leaning towards leaving United last summer after former boss Ferguson made public a private conversation that the player was not happy with his role in the team.

Rooney’s future at United was a ticking time-bomb handed down by Ferguson to United’s new manager.

But Moyes skilfully defused the situation." - from the article.

I guess the Mirror is the most 'reliable' source of information and we have David Moyes to thank for "skilfully defusing" the Rooney situation, which was said to be a "ticking time-bomb" especially after that 20m bid from Chelsea, we also need to thank Dave for masterminding our top 4 finish this season by somehow making the champions finish 7th to accommodate his sacking and Giggs' retirement/short stint as coach and LVG's appointment, which has made his signings to thrive enabling us to finish in the top 4....dont forget Guillermo Varela who was included in Real Madrid's CL squad this season after going to Castilla on loan- don't think Moyeseh gets a lot of credit for that too.

5610~~~
There are basic human truths and that everyone is responsible for some good. Why this concept escapes some of you perhaps speaks more about you as people than you'd like to admit.

Miyes was not a good manager for us. I'm glad he's gone, but if there was one good thing about his reign it was his work in defusing Wayne's desire to leave.

If you cant even give him that, youre fecking insufferable.

5611~~~
Right. Again, you would know. Did Moyes commit a war crime against your family or something because this is ludicrous.

Do you also argue in favour of the flat earth theory?

5612~~~
Also, do you believe you're right and that Neville is wrong on this matter?

5614~~~
I'm sorry, but anyone can diffuse Rooney's desire to leave by offering him 300k a week, something he doesn't deserve.

And as for making Rooney stay, personally I prefer those 30 million Jose was going to give us.

5615~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Kleberson coming on.

5616~~~
I am really glad that Rooney has stayed. 

He will become our all time top scorer! And his records will remain for a very long time!!! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5617~~~
well then <i>i'm sorry </i>that you're daft enough to accept 30 million pounds (from two seasons ago, no less) that would have seen us lose our top outfield player to chelsea, all for a sum of money we don't need. 30 million would literally have no affect on our transfer business whatsoever. but hey, at least rooney would then have played for chelsea last year and this, relieving us of his terrible burden. oh, and he'd likely have been enough for them to win the title last year as well.

ridiculous.

5618~~~
Ridiculous is the correct word.

5619~~~
there isn't a manager today on the face of the earth that would agree with him. not one.

5620~~~
You do realise I'm on your side don't you?

5621~~~
yup, i thought you were the guy i was quoting at first and then changed it from "you" to "him". woops! sorry <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5622~~~
Do you get a cut of those 30m?

And it's 400k.

5623~~~
400k do you have inside knowledge or just plucking a figure? We could have sold Rooney and bought Falcao outright brilliant signing much better player.......oh wait shit

5624~~~
I'm mocking the 300k figure.

5625~~~
I heard 500k

5626~~~
Pretty sure it's 350k and he gets a large percentage of Falcao's image rights. It's why the chap always looks on the verge of tears.

5627~~~
Not enough runs or movement going forward so far in the Everton game. Decent defensive work and pressure but when the midfielders have the ball he's standing and watching, not moving or looking for a through ball far too often. Thus slowing it down. Could be orders from Louis but it's no wonder Falcao was seen to be warming up.

5628~~~
I'm not seeing the dynamic striker others do. He's been shite again.

5629~~~
Not good enough anymore to bring United to a higher level on his own, been quite poor since Spurs.

5630~~~
Why is he so averse to making runs in behind?

5631~~~
I see Rooney doing very little, but at the same time, we seem to offer him absolutely nothing, as we did last week.

5632~~~
He doesn't have the ability to drag us through games like these. He's been crap for a few weeks now, silent domination my arse

5633~~~
He's been helped by being way better than Falcao and a fair bit better than Van Persie. He doesn't compare favourably to the forwards in the top sides around Europe, whom we presumably want to be one of again in the next couple of seasons. That being said, it would be very difficult for anyone up front given how slowly we're moving it and the lack of service they'd get.

5634~~~
The best clubs have a striker that nets them 25-30 league goals a season.  He'll continue to hold us back as we've committed to building a team around a 15-20 goal striker.

5635~~~
Standard Goodison bottle job.

5636~~~
Service has been poor to him. However, in a lone striker formation like this we need guys like Mata and Fellaini to really be in a supporting role and cause danger. So far we do not have any players that can take a ball, turn and run past a defender.

The one player that we have that can do that is sitting on the bench.

Top four is no guarantee with the amount of away fixtures we still need to play. At this rate Rooney better get his shooting boots on because we MUST win our remaining home matches and at least get results from our other away matches.

5637~~~
If this 433 thing is going to be permanent then rooney can't be our main striker, he simply isn't good enough

5638~~~
Anonymous again. He shouldn't be undroppable.

5639~~~
He's better than most other United players on the field.

5640~~~
He's never played well against Everton as far as I can remember.

5641~~~
If I hadn't watched the game I'd have thought he was terrible. As it is, he's had a decent game with zero service as has been the case no matter who's played up top. We don't create enough. Simple.

5642~~~
...wut

5643~~~
It's pretty simple sentence.

He's playing better than most United players on the pitch.

5644~~~
I understand the words, but in that order it doesn't make sense (definitely not based on today's game).

5645~~~
I'd put only Smalling, Shaw and <span style="text-decoration: line-through">De Gea</span> as being better today. Rest, definitely not.

EDIT: Actually, De Gea done nothing today.

5646~~~
He's been as awful as the rest of our team. 

Worst performance of the season (for our entire team).

5647~~~
Enjoying his annual stroll at Goodison Park.

5648~~~
Don't think he's been rubbish actually. In the first half he did quite well. I think we play too much sideways when he plays deeper, which I don't like.

5649~~~
Walk it off!

What a warrior.

5650~~~
The usual Rooney at Goodison display. Actually he's been slightly better than previous years in that he's not given the ball away as much.

5651~~~
Hate him in the deeper role, have for years. He's not offering much up top at the minute either.

5652~~~
Blessing in disguise...

5653~~~
Mirallas did better as a sub than Roo in the whole game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5654~~~
Injuries always are. YNW...ah, sorry. Forgot where I was.

5655~~~
His last decent game was Spurs? In really poor form.

5656~~~
Fecking shite he was. He is not a top level striker for me, his touch is so poor and his hold up play was non existent. Constantly beaten to the ball when it was played into him, we need a more dynamic striker up top than him, Falcao and RVP.

5657~~~
Silently dominated the game today. Can't wait for G Nevs analysis.

5658~~~
His form has dropped a fair bit the last few games. His status as captain and thus being immune from being dropped is an issue that will hinder us in the future.

5659~~~
Classy.

5660~~~
We desperately need a new striker. Rooney has alway been good in short bursts but he is past his best and only going to get worse over the next year or so, as RVP has.

5661~~~
Thought that was the consensus surrounding an injury? 

It was tongue in cheek, btw.

5662~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5663~~~
I hope that injury is not too serious.

5664~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5665~~~
thought he had played well..missed his chance like others. well marked.

desperatley need him fit for the next 4 matches.

how bad is the knock?

5666~~~
did I hear he'd only scored 4 against Everton in the 11 years?

Say that's in 22-25 games (not sure how many cup games), that's pretty poor. I know he's missed a few games, injured/kept out of the abuse, but still.

5667~~~
hasn't put in a really good performance since the Spurs match 

You'd expect more from him

5668~~~
He is going to be a hindrance going forwards but no one seems to see it.

5669~~~
I wonder if there's a striker in the world that would look good in the sole striker role in this system?

5670~~~
His touch and hold up play wasn't very good, but in a front 3 the 2 players left and right of him need to get much closer and they didn't all game, so he was isolated.

5671~~~
F all service.

5672~~~
Thing is, if you have little service, then you have to make the most of any situation where you have the ball/are affecting the play, and Rooney didn't do that... so yeah, pretty rubbish overall.

5673~~~
Seems to exist in this purgatory of too good to let go, but not good enough to truly reach the levels we need. Yet we persist, stuck in this long-term relationship that is not rewarding.

5674~~~
He's played at most 2 good games since he was moved as a striker. If Falcao or RVP would be putting in these kind of performances people would be asking for their heads.

5675~~~
He's done alright against <i>tougher</i> teams.

5676~~~
This.! Seriously disappointing! Not a captains display.

5677~~~
Was decent in the first half like most of the team.

Poor in the 2nd half like most of the team as well.

5678~~~
It would take a different kind of player, not one who is by nature more a '10' than a '9'.

5679~~~
Been saying all season that I think he needs to be improved upon, however I can't see it happening. I'm not even sure if there is any better on the market now, I just know that he's been left behind the great attacking players in the game today. 

He's too easy to handle by defenders who themselves are not even all that, and I also don't think he has enough of a goal threat these days.

5680~~~
You presumably think RVP and Falcao are past it then? See I'm of the opinion that both still have a lot to offer and would look different players in a team firing on full cylinders playing a system that plays to their strengths. I don't think Falcao will ever work here, but RVP has potential as he's not had a chance when we've been playing well.

5681~~~
He was fine in the first half. Poor the second, like the whole team. 

If I never have to witness that pass out wide to Valencia ever again I'll be a happy man.

5682~~~
Rooney is as clear a #9 one will ever see so we're in good hands.

5683~~~
Any word on his injury?

5684~~~
Probably 'Nike'.

5685~~~
I'd entirely disagree with that.

5686~~~
People have given him all the excuses in the world this season. But hes failing week in week out

5687~~~
not that he was any good at Goodison but he sucks for some games now and not even that fantastic as no9 tbh... still think we can get better player to lead the line...Can see Rooney being a problem similar to Gerrard and Lampard for Lpool and Chelsea respectively.. The only think which makes him look like a great striker is that Falcao and Van Persie are so dire. And don't take me wrong he's great striker on his day but too many frustrating performances and there are better options out on the market but he will be captain and finish his career here<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

5688~~~
He was very poor today I thought, even lacked energy at times it seemed.

5689~~~
If he isn't a #9 then he's up shit creek then. But I think he is. Phenomenal finisher, good movement, proven ability to score goals, can press well and holds the ball up to a reasonable standard. So yeah, I think we're in safe hands.

5690~~~
... What a disaster of a comment. Go away.

5691~~~
Let's be honest, he is a striker built for the 4-4-2 formation. We really need a Modern forward who is good at making space for himself in the box, being able to control the ball in tight areas and get a shot away under pressure.

5692~~~
Still waiting to see if its a serious one.

5693~~~
Falcao was beyond horrendous but Rooney wasn't that much better. RvP deserves a runout in the rotation of shitness.

5694~~~
Not a lot left this season, we need him till our place is sealed. Fingers crossed.

5695~~~
Well, no. He's played the majority of his career as a #10/second striker. He's at his most comfortable when he's playing off someone and that I think is fairly obvious. He's a very good finisher, so he'll score goals when played up top.

5696~~~
Why because im not a jarhead that nods along?

His form has been a disaster. In nearly every single game the past 2 months hes been a disaster. Yet he gets credit by people coming up with excuses, and even while on a long run of bad plays he still is the first name on the paper.

You all accepted mediocre a long time ago, thats why you don't complain.

If United wants to become among the best clubs of the world again then dropping Rooney completely is a requirement.

5697~~~
I certainly hope Van Persie isn't past it, but he has shown some physical problems. I actually think he has had a few very silent games this season, but on the whole did all right. Falcao has never been at his level, just a finisher with an insecure first touch and not cut out to play with his back to goal, and not a real top player anyway. 

I like Rooney, but not as a centre forward in 4-3-3. In 4-4-2 he should be second striker, and in 4-3-3 therefore a '10', attacking midfielder. It's a difficult job to play cf in 4-3-3, different from 'normal' strikers job. I know for sure Van Persie can do it, but not just any good striker.

5698~~~
This is why we need to sign 2 strikers this summer, but trust some people to say "we have Rooney,RVP and Wilson, we'll be fine".

5699~~~
Im just going to quote this to give it more exposure.

5700~~~
I disagree. His best ever season was when playing as the central forward. He's too predictable behind the striker, slows down the tempo and the way we currently operate under Van Gaal isn't conducive to the way Rooney has previously excelled in that position. So he's either right up top or on the bench, for me. I prefer the former.

5701~~~
Right up top under Van Gaal is a different job than up top under SAF.

5702~~~
Wherever Rooney plays, he always ends up needing to play somewhere else to get the best out of him, whether it's #9, #10 or midfield.

5703~~~
His best ever period of form was when he played behind Hernandez for me..as a #10. 

Whether he's predictable or not behind the front man generally depends on who he's playing with or how fast our tempo is. Play as we are, and he's not the only one passing it out wide though he's certainly the only to get constantly picked out for it.

As it is, he's no less predictable any of our other supposed creative players.

5704~~~
Van Gaal seems to like him where he is now. He said as much just before the game.

5705~~~
In poor form and really should be dropped for it but unfortunately our other strikers are Van Persie (injured/way off form), Falcao (useless) and Wilson who's a youth prospect and won't be displacing him. He actually might not make West Brom anyway depending on how bad that knock is.

5706~~~
Doing what? And he tackled his own player! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5707~~~
He's working with what he has, but I doubt he would buy him for the 9 role.

5708~~~
Higher tempo definitely seems to suit Rooney, but the problem then is that his general play throughout the build up tends to stand out for what it really is; laborious and untidy. Playing up top negates those weaknesses and better serves his strengths, albeit I think we're going to have to agree to disagree on this.

5709~~~
very good player who hasn't consistently (over a ten game spell for example) put in very good performances for years

I dunno about Rooney...... he seems to have really drifted in and out of games lately - I was hoping to see him try and bully Stones today but he struggled to get involved - he seemed a bit lethargic also

Falcao and RVP drifted in and out of games too.....is it a problem with our tactics? we can't seem to involve our number 9 in the game

5710~~~
Was terrible today, lack of effort and his first touch was all over the place. In his defence when he received the ball, no-one got close to him and he was isolated up there but for a top class striker he should be doing better.

5711~~~
You are acting like the ass kissing kid in class.

If you actually believe Rooney has been good the past 2 months then you are a clown.

You might support the club as a die hard fan, but that doesn't mean you should be oblivious for obvious problems.

I assume you found Valencia's display today amazing too right because of his positive attitude and workrate.

Because thats pretty much Rooney in a nutshell.

5712~~~
haha that's right, the problem is he's not best anywhere he's well rounded player who is capable of some brilliant thing ehwn everything clicks but apart that he can be very frustrating delivering too many 6/10  performances.. should have been sold imo, he's three+years past it.. ankle injuries and whatever else fecked his sharp movement, he's adapted quite well but not to be no1 at any position. Shame I liked Rooney and his potential but he's declining for years..

5713~~~
You had a pretty good post until you threw in the tiring, and completely unnecessary eye-roll at the end. There's nothing wrong with Rooney finishing his career here, or being captain for that matter. However, he is approaching 30 and would hardly be the first player to start going downhill at that age. I think a striker should be a priority this summer.

5714~~~
I would give RVP a run of games up front on his own the way Rooney is playing right now.

5715~~~
There were countless times Rooney showed for the ball today and we didn't find his feet. The few times we did, we created danger. For example, when someone played it into his feet and he laid it off to the on running Herrera.  

I think this is where we missed Carrick, though. He's the only player from deep we have who constantly picks out those passes and find players in between the lines. Blind, whilst being good on the ball, hasn't got that in his locker and spends too much time on the ball thinking about the pass.

5716~~~
Which is pretty much the problem. Rooney always relies on the team performing great in order to perform himself.

A striker needs to be able to make something out of nothing. And Rooney does this way to little compared to his younger days. And people need to start accepting/seeing that.

5717~~~
Not just Rooney, though. The 'team' performs better with Carrick. This is why Herrera, Fellaini, Mata and co. (basically players who play in between the lines) weren't as effective today either. Blind just plays it side to side, whereas Carrick find players in good positions, where they can create danger. 

Also, how you can say Rooney can't create something out of nothing baffles me. Sure it might be less than when he was younger, but he still do so. See his goal vs Spurs or Villa, for example.

5718~~~
He's suffering just like our other strikers were being starved of service, yet getting ripped into for being past it. Heck Rooney looks like nothing special at all in most of his run of games up front, but I don't really blame him completely. He's put in a top game against Spurs, and scored a few before that but really, past 5 games he's done very little and apart from a superb goal against Villa it's been just like deja vu with our other strikers most of the season. It's like clutching at straws saying he is doing all this off the ball stuff because it's nothing groundbreaking at all really. It's the standard stuff you expect when a guy plays up top and something Falcao done mostly last week, with both not looking threatening at all. The good run came because the midfield for me. They still don't connect well with the striker.

Look at this run infact,

Sunderland, rubbish game, 2 goals after a red card.
Newcastle, average, although had a part to play in the goal.
Spurs, top performance with a good goal.
Liverpool, pretty bad.
Villa, pretty bad with a goal out of nowhere near the end.
City, silent domination!!!
Chelsea, out of position, average.
today, pretty bad.

Quite the trend, and shows that the problem must be more than just the striker, rather the team not getting him in the game enough and the same goes for when RVP was playing.

5719~~~
I don't think he's past it, he has always been like that. Technically he has never been amongst the most gifted, he always had matches with lots of poor touches when not in form. He's a top player because he combines decent skill with agility, industry, fight and vison, not because he's as gifted as he was made out to be in his early years.

5720~~~
Rooney's problem is that he's incredibly streaky.  5 games on, 5 games off.  We'll see one more great run  from him before he heads off to the beach.

5721~~~
Apart from the horrible defending, naming 1 goal...5 weeks ago? Which was already a winning game hardly makes a difference.

Where was he against liverpool? city? today? If you cannot rely on your sole striker to net in his chances (and he had plenty) then GG

5722~~~
His usual useless game on Merseyside.

He's not played well for weeks but our other options are even worse so he's go no real competition.

5723~~~
how is he agile? he's everything but agile. He's no more top player,  which season are you watching, it's the general thinking and overrating because of his name on his back that makes you think this, surely that must be it.. there's no other explanation.. he was very different and much better player three/four years ago.. he lost yards of pace and agility which made him so lethal, he could beat a player, he adjusted quite well, it's true his vision's good but how many times he had all the time to make such creative pass? His technique lets him down a lot. 

Rooney's great finisher, has a good shot but long time I've seen him to release something which wasn't blocked or sent to stands or just to the hands of goalkeeper (his stupid chips). We have no better striker now but we can do better I am sure of it

5724~~~
Pretty much yeah, but i still rather have a RVP out of form then a Rooney out of form.

5725~~~
Pretty much this.

5726~~~
I presume that was on the game of FIFA you were playing because in the real life game from Goodison Park he was awful.

5727~~~
Well that's not a fecking shock, is it? At least when Rooney doesn't play well, he presses well and runs in behind. What the feck has RVP done in the last two years apart from moaning like a little tart? People thought it'd change when Van Gaal come in but he's been worse.

Horrible defending? Not sure Van Persie or Falcao would have done that.

Also, i'm not just talking about his goals, i'm talking about what he does that helps the team, i.e. pressing, runs in behind, etc. That's why Van Gaal said he is playing up top because its best for the 'TEAM'.

As for plenty of chances that's just rubbish.

5728~~~
No service.

5729~~~
Saw a 'blessing in disguise' post earlier here. 

We'll see how will that one feel if he's injured for a while. 

COuld be better but RVP and Falcao are even worse..

5730~~~
on the sunday supplement today one of the guys was saying how well Rooney played in midfield last week and seems to be getting better no matter where he is asked to play. truly mindboggling

5731~~~
oh I'm not one of these "rooney doesn't turn up in the big games" people by any means.
 I think he's been our most key player for years. even in the VP golden season.

It's the record away at Liverpool/Everton that is odd.

5732~~~
Honestly rather Fellaini start up front if both Rooney and RvP are unable to start next week. Any news on his injury yet?

5733~~~
And pray tell, who was so better than him today? Save for Smalling and Shaw (who also dropped in second half), who really?

5734~~~
Are they? Imo RVP's best matches this season were better than Rooney's best matches up top, and his worst matches weren't that much worse. But when he still played the quality of the team performance didn't leave any room for things like 'silent domination'.

5735~~~
How long on the injury do we think?

5736~~~
Don't think it was too serious, as he continued to play and jog for a few minutes before substitution. Would've been out asap if something really nasty happened.

5737~~~
I was thinking this - with the way that both Chelsea and Everton have set out to nullify Fellaini, sticking him in a striker role could throw a bit of a spanner in the works for the opponent.

5738~~~
I agree.

To be fair, he should not play in CM, but his striker performances has been sub par for a 300k/week striker. He does have the ability to do great things, but he has stinkers like today way to often in my opinion. The worst thing though, is even a out of form Rooney is better than our other options, which is just sad.

5739~~~
I'd still prefer Rooney on the pitch than otherwise. He's just one of those players who can pull something out of the bag..whether it's that pass that makes the goal...or the goal itself. He so wants Champions League football, no doubt about that.

5740~~~
To be fair Persie haven't played yet as lone striker... Neither has Wilson so its not right to say that other options are even worse... Its not like Rooney was better than all of them as striker in the 352 and 442 system.  Only Rooney and Falcao have played on the top in the 433 system..

5741~~~
Van Persie did in the games following Rooney's sending off vs West Ham.

5742~~~
Didn't Di Maria play with him as striker in those games??? I think we started the 433 system against Arsenal in FA Cup.

5743~~~
Falcao played v Everton, RVP started against WBA and Chelsea as a lone forward.

5744~~~
Still waiting on Gary Neville's analysis till I can properly judge his performance. I thought he quite poor, but van Gaal might have thought that was his second best performance this season.

5745~~~
The City game too I think. Rooney was in midfield.

5746~~~
Not so sure about that.

5747~~~
Looks like he's okay.

5748~~~
That is what I have always believed. He is a good player that performs well when the team performs well. He is not a superstar, in that, when things are going wrong he does not have the ability to take things into his own hands (feet ) and win us the game. This is why I have never wanted him to be the main man in our team. He just does not have that skill level.
Aside from this I am not surprised he was ineffective today, as I have said repeatedly, no striker can perform well with the lack of creativity we have in central midfield.

5749~~~
Wasn't good today but he doesn't deserve to be singled out.

5750~~~
Good news.

5751~~~
We badly need a top class #9 if we are playing one upfront. He isn't that sort of player, although id argue there isn't really a place for a player like him in the system we play.

5752~~~
Well he's only scored 7 fewer than Rooney, despite being injured a fair bit, and as for the moaning, I really don't get where that comes from. Apart from one comment last year where he complained about people being in his space, I don't recall any moaning from RVP. And I really don't find that comment any worse than Rooney's non-celebrating in the first game of last season. 

Just to be clear, I think RVP has underwhelmed over the last 2 seasons, but I don't think Rooney's been much better. He had a few good runs of form last season, but this season has been pretty patchy, as far as I'm concerned.

5753~~~
To be fair though, in his first season he showed us what a striker should be achieving in a Manchester United shirt.
26 goals in the league, will Rooney get to half of that this season?  Probably not, he hasn't done in half of the seasons since he joined us.
This is why people will be calling for RVP, fond memories of a striker that looked unstoppable.

5754~~~
The 2012 RVP was magical. Not just scoring too, his all round game was amazing that year.

5755~~~
I don't think he was bad today but considering his abilities as a lone striker he should be definitely scoring more goals to warrant place up front. You could always rely on his goalscoring abilities but in last three games against good opposition he barely had shot on goal even though we as a team played two good games, and he scored just one goal in last five games and that was against Aston Villa at home even though he was our most forward player during that time. Recently, he is definitely far from player opposition defences are scared of.

5756~~~
I wish I could shock him every time he does it.  He might look up for once and find a better option instead of mindlessly hitting it wide to Valencia every time.
Agreed.  We can't move the ball fast enough when he is in midfield against a team that defends deep.

5757~~~
At the start of the season I would have been happy if he got 10 goals and a couple of assists. He's over achieved in my books. We all know he's half the player he once was. I struggled to get over that fact, I moaned about it but there comes a time where you have to face reality. If you can get 20 decent games out of him in a season, then its worth having him around.

5758~~~
Rooney is a quality player and world class when he wants to turn up, but he simply is not repaying his salary on the football pitch. Obviously not helped by the fact he moves positions all the time but he isn't doing enough right now.

5759~~~
Good that he's not injured, we'd be up shits creek for sure if we had to start either of our other 2 #9's.

5760~~~
To be fair, we all expected RVP and Falcao to destroy defences,i don't think he has overachieved, his competitors have just been terrible.

5761~~~
No striker in the world would have done well with the service today. Appalling from DDG out.

5762~~~
He didnt see much of the ball. Really dissappointed we couldnt create chances for him

5763~~~
To back up(sort of) my argument:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3057408/Wayne-Rooney-scored-just-17-away-games-Premier-League-Manchester-United-s-striker-15-17-Old-Trafford.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...ster-United-s-striker-15-17-Old-Trafford.html</a>

Bit shocking to read this. He definitely wasn't that impressive in front of goal this season apart from few games in the middle of season, which was actually when he played in midfield. It's bloody annoying because if there is something he is good at then it's scoring goals.

5764~~~
Ferguson thought he was finished in his final year, nothing has changed performance wise to prove him wrong. Grossly overpaid, ransomed the club at every opportunity and offers dross performances on a regular basis. Should've got shot of him two years ago, not made him captain and increase his wages.

5765~~~
So he scores more goals at home - when the team has been playing well - than he has on the road, when the team has been playing crap.

Any other shocking revelations? Because those Daily Mail stats are positively mind-blowing.

5766~~~
Should be interesting if he misses a couple games and van Persie gets to play the lone center forward role.

5767~~~
Geez, I thought that people would be giving him a rest after he showed himself to be by far our best striker this season (and the last one).

5768~~~
He's doing a fine job up top but I'd love for us to add a forward with genuine dynamism who can cause some fear among defenders. Rooney has become a very very dependable finisher now, but it would be nice to have someone up too who's a bit electric.

5769~~~
Still doesnt make him good enough, he's better than RVP and Falcao but United want to go back to the very top, he hasnt shown that his level is over there recently.

5770~~~
Problem with that is he is a genuine liability everywhere else and looks like he's undroppable for LvG. So whatever striker you get will have to be good with being 2nd choice atleast for the time being.

5771~~~
I dont think he's a genuine liability. When he plays badly he can be really awful, that's just Wayne Rooney and given he's up top, it's less hurtful to us than when he was q number 10.

In general I think he's doing well. The only issue for me is that he doesn't strike fear into defenders. He doesn't burn them with his pace or twist them with his dribbling. That "wow" factor when he's with got the ball at his feet is gone. 

I still think he's fine as first choice but ideally I'd like us to get someone as second choice who has those attributes but not necessarily the dependability in front of goal that Rooney offers.

5772~~~
Like a wildcard sub that can just mix things up?

5773~~~
No, more like someone who can take over from Rooney in 2 years time. Someone with top class potential.

5774~~~
Makes sense to me

5775~~~
Benteke?

5776~~~
He needs to learn the offside rule first.

5777~~~
I agree. He hasn't been dynamic enough but our players seem too occupied playing in triangles and Rooney is left without the ball.

5778~~~
Him, Falcao and Van Persie could all learn it together

5779~~~
It's not about Daily Mail, it's about Rooney scoring just one goal away from home this season. Not that he scores <i>more </i>goals at home, he basically scores <i>only </i>at home this season. 

You are making it sound like we are shit away from home all the time, just last game we outplayed and dominated best team in the league at their stadium, few weeks before we outplayed and dominated Liverpool on their pitch and Rooney was our worst player, so you could admit one time in your life that something could be Rooney's fault and not someone's else. When he is scoring he is getting credit for being great goalscorer, but when he isn't it's the team who is at fault. As I said, I know people see me here as Rooney hater, but I definitely rate his goalscoring abilities, I said that many times here and praised him for. One goal away from home all season for our supposedly "best striker by a mile" is definitely something to be worried about, even if he's played out of position many times. Coming into the next season with even older van Persie and Rooney who is still hit and miss as striker and fighting in both CL and Premierleague isn't something to rely on IMO, especially if our wide players aren't great goal threat either, and Young has scored just two goals this season.

5780~~~
We <i>are</i> shit away from home. Have been all season. It's been a major and obvious problem. Two recent good performances doesn't change that fact.

If you want something to worry about, look at our away form <a class="externalLink" href="http://m.premierleague.com/en-gb/form-guide.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> and (just for a week) take a break from slagging Rooney off. We've accumulated just 4 points more on the road than the team with the second worst record in the whole league.

5781~~~
No one is really that great away from home, just that teams like Chelsea get the results by scrappy goal or two, something we are missing. 
It's really not that big difference between the 5th and 10th place in that table. Rooney scoring against Chelsea(or anyone else away from home) could win us that game and we would be fifth in that table.
Look at City, they are even worse than us and yet Aguero is scoring quite often for them away from home. Proven world class strikers tend to score goals even when their team aren't playing that great.

And I actually praised Rooney just last week when majority here criticized him, I also said yesterday in the post before you quoted that I don't think he was bad as (again) majority was saying.

5782~~~
Aguero's record away from home has been consistently bad since he signed for City. His decent away record this season is as much of an aberration as Rooney's poor record on the road.

5783~~~
On anything other than the midfield the great man sure knew a thing or two about football.

5784~~~
It's not decent, it's excellent - he has scored 11 away goals this season. Last season he spent around 1/3 of the season injured and he still scored 7 away goals. Season before that was bit worse but still he wasn't that bad, total of 5 away goals but he scored just 12 goals in total anyway, and pretty much every one of those away goals was in games they won just by one goal, so he pretty much had 5 away winners last season. 7 goals in his first season at City, that's not bad either.
So, out of 73 league goals he scored for City, 30 were away from home, and that's bad for you but you are fine with Rooney's away record this season?

5785~~~
You are beyond delusional.

5786~~~
Not really. How many times did he get the ball in dangerous positions? Hardly any. He wasn't great but Herrera and blind and Mata  did very poor in a creative sense. Also the crosses were mainly shot all game too.

I think the striker position at United is one of the least worries at the moment.

5787~~~
I joined the café because I was really frustrated with our situation at that time. Moyes was in charge and he made Rooney his main man. I said then that I was willing to wait out both of them because I knew we would never win anything with that set up. Rooney is an untouchable and his fan base is so great and somewhat blinded by their devotion that unfortunately even under LVG our situation remains the same. Mata has now become a favourite as he links up better with Rooney than anyone else, however, Mata is incredibly uncreative. People will argue using stats well how about just actually watching their entire performances on a game by game basis. Putting the ball in the net is what this game is ultimately all bout, however, technical ability is what allows players to shine above their peers and results in team success. We have won when we had such players playing a major role in our team.
Rooney is a hard-working passionate player and self-sacrifices thus he is popular with fans and other managers but he can not, has not and will not lead us to victory.

5788~~~
He's the best striker in the last two season for United, but that doesn't mean much, does it? You and I know we need a better striker.

5789~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's always someone else's fault isn't it. 

"our players are too focused on passing it and don't find him in dangerous positions"

"when he doesn't score it's because the team isn't playing well" 

"silent domination" 


Has been anonymous for a good run of games now. For me our strikers don't do enough to move defenders around. They're always receiving the ball with their back to goal and end up being instantly dispossessed because of how tightly marked they are. Against Everton who defended so deep and packed, the lack of midfielders who were willing to make runs into the channel didn't help with this. Rooney looks more like a pivot now than the pacey bulldog  he was when he was younger; receives the ball, looks for a pass to an advancing option. We need an Aguero or Suarez.

5790~~~
The Mirror suggesting that he's out for the rest of the season. Shame that he's likely to miss the Arsenal game in particular.

5791~~~
Yes, that is bad for me. Up until this season. As I already said.

5792~~~
If you say so...

5793~~~
In that case I hope RVP will start next games and all the other.

5794~~~
Him until CL place is confirmed and then give Wilson games!

5795~~~

5796~~~
That was my absolute favorite. In a game where he had some horrendous touches and struggled throughout, the great Carra-Neville analysis team declared it ""Silent Domination". Some of the shit these pundits come up with is hilarious. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5797~~~
Apparently he's out for the final four games. Good thing that RVP is back

5798~~~
Glad with Liverpool's loss even more now. Could have been another damaging injury otherwise.

5799~~~
Fuuckk.. He's played so much this season, this was coming though..

5800~~~
Thankfully RvP is back just at the right time, scored twice for the U21s last night didn't he?  He will deliver when the chips are down, I am sure of it.

5801~~~
Shouldn't this be a new thread rather than on the mega thread?

5802~~~
Might not miss him, too much. Hasn't been great, recently, although none of our strikers have been. 

We might even be better off playing a midfielder up front, as they seem to know how to score.

5803~~~
Boss said Rooney's fit to play. Praise Odin!

5804~~~
With Shaw's injury should we be expecting/fearing that Rooney will be in midfield tomorrow with Blind moved to left back?

5805~~~
With Rojo also out, the only other option at leftback is Ashley Young. Van Gaal has only used Young at leftback once this season, and that was when he was forced to bring Shaw off because of injury. Not sure if a left side of Young-Di Maria will be good enough defensively.

Rooney is also one of the few players who van Gaal deems good enough to be a defensive player so he has his balance. So it's very likely that Rooney will play 8 and Herrera 6.

5806~~~
He really needs to dribble/attack spaces more. He is so easy to play against I feel.

5807~~~
Why is he undroppable, dont see what he brings to the table.

5808~~~
Anonymous again.

5809~~~
How close are him and rio? Wonder if his mind is elsewhere today.

5810~~~
The fact he's on similar wages to messi and ronaldo is sickening tbh. He's shit, he has one decent game in 5 or 6 games.

5811~~~
come on man, don't bring Rio into this.

5812~~~
I'm not blaming. Legitimate comment. I thought they were close mates. It would be understandable for rooney mental state to be affected if the families are close

5813~~~
or maybe he's just shit.

5814~~~
Right before West Brom's break for the free kick Rooney was on the ground protesting for a free kick when the ball went right past him. Should've just got on with it. Always seems to let stuff like that get to him. Nice dive late on too, but obviously it wasn't jonny foreigner.

5815~~~
Did not look like he gave two shits today... a disgrace of a performance

5816~~~
He just offers very little of extra class and doesnt look like the elite player he was before.. Hope he gets his form back, we need another scoring streak.

5817~~~
When will Gary Neville analyse his performance? Another crap performance.

5818~~~
Gone missing.

5819~~~
He gets paid £300k a week, he's our captain, he's meant to be leading by example and yet still he's got a million apologists defending him when he's found anonymous again.

5820~~~
Lets be honest here. He's a very good player, but trying to build a team around him after Ronaldo left has been a poor decision

5821~~~
Where the feck was he in that second half?

How can an out of sorts RVP play better in that no10 role than him?

5822~~~
He offers nothing deeper except workrate, if not used as a #9 he's not going to offer us a lot in a tightly packed game.

5823~~~
Wank today. Did barely anything on the ball, didn't even work too hard off it, sloppy passing throughout. Needs to get back in form, he's been poor for his standards for a few months now really.

5824~~~
When he plays in midfield we always lose while always dominating possession. He should be nowhere near midfield ever again

5825~~~
Why is he a holding midfielder at home against West Brom?

He plays on instinct not nous. Every time he's in midfield he tries too much and becomes a clogger. He should have been further up where he can go up against their defence. Not covering ours.

5826~~~
Crap again, either play him upfront or dont play him at all.

5827~~~
I'd rather see Pereira at cm than Wayne. He's just not a good midfielder.

5828~~~
He should have stepped up and taken the penalty. Really disappointed that he deferred responsibility to a player who hasn't scored in months.

5829~~~
He didn't even offer work rate today... Didn't look bothered at all.

5830~~~
Such an overrated player. He's not exceptional at anything. The sooner we get rid, the better.

5831~~~
Not a midfielder. Just doesn't have the dynamism or the guile. He's not quick enough in the head. You see Mata and Herrera using the ball with split second decisions, and it makes Rooney's overall play look like a slow-motion replay.

I still think he's a solid centre forward, but that is all he is. I just don't know what all these pundits are seeing when they say that they see Rooney being a midfielder in the next few years. If anything, I see it going the other way, and I predict he'll be more of an Inzaghi centre forward into his 30s, limited involvement and just playing on the shoulder. I think he'll always be a good finisher, but his mobility and quickness of thought will wane, and I don't think he's too strong at the latter anyway.

5832~~~
I'll say it again he is not the player we thought he would develop into, today he was awful, too safe that dynamic spark long gone.

5833~~~
Agree, but he can be very useful without being exceptional at many things. We can't afford to sell him until we get a player of his ability/potential.

5834~~~
He's shite in midfield but I find it hard to criticise him too much, simply because he's being played out of position.

5835~~~
Dire today, no supprise as HE IS NOT A feckING MIDFIELDER

5836~~~
He's not been a good centre forward really this season either. People were falsely led into believing it because we had what looked like a solid team that's now been found out because Carrick is injured and half of them aren't that good.

5837~~~
He is not a midfielder and shouldnt be used in this role.

5838~~~
Isn't his penalty record actually quite poor?

5839~~~
If I recall, Van Persie took over responsibilities for penalties from Rooney. Of course this was under Fergie's last year.

Given he missed his last pen he probably wasn't best placed to demand an immediate change either.

5840~~~
He doesn't know how to play as a midfielder, like at all. He has one idea, ping it to the right wing. Maybe he still thinks we have Ronaldo playing there <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5841~~~
Rooney doesn't have a future in our team(As a starter) if we are looking to contend.

5842~~~
That pass out wide to the right spoils my football-watching experience every week.

5843~~~
He's not a centre forward either, at least not good enough.

5844~~~
I don't understand people claiming he's not a good midfielder - well he's not <i>that </i>good a centre forward either! He'll have to earn his place in the coming years IMO unlike this year when he has been an automatic starter.

5845~~~
Sadly, i agree. He's a good CF, but imo, hes been on the decline in about 5 years now and i don't see him getting any better. His technique, has always been mediocre, but he made up for that by having God-like physique and fighting spirit. I fondly remember the days when he could just glide past players and brush off center backs with seemingly no effort.

What he delivered today, was embarrassing for a United captain. I know very well that CM is not his position, but that does now excuse his complete lack of effort, desire and leadership today. All he did was drop back, pass sideways, drop back, pass sideways, make a meaningless crosspass, drop back, pass sideways, repeat ad infinitum

5846~~~
He is.

5847~~~
He is unable to control the tempo of central midfield so that is why he should never be there. His success as a striker is based on pace, aggression, good positional sense and a good eye for goal. It's his natural position. We look like a pub team when Rooney plays in midfield. If you put Van Persie or Mata in central midfield than you get a similar result..you get a player that is like a fish out of water...controlling the tempo in central midfield is a very specialized role that very few players like Carrick, Keane or Scholes specialize in. Giggs wasn't bad at it. Rooney is atrocious at it

5848~~~
He thinks he is Scholes. Scholes did the cross field pass perfect and at the right time.

Rooney does it and it's a slow loopy ball. Which allows opposition to retreat back. It's like Scholes in slow motion.

5849~~~
I love the aggression and energy he provided today...

5850~~~
Scholes also had more in his locker, the cross field pass was just something he was very good at.

Take for example scholes assist to Rooney in the game Vs Milan in 2007. Rooney simply doesnt have the vision for that kind of pass.

5851~~~
He's shit in midfield, it's nothing new. He can't control the tempo and his passing is nowhere near consistent enough.

5852~~~
We want to be at the top of the world, he isnt level Suarez/Aguero or Lewa/Benzema/Costa anymore.

5853~~~
So poor lately. All he contributes is sideways passing. If van Gaal insists he must play then play him wide and move Mata infield.

5854~~~
Not always true. He really pinged in some great balls to the right today (sadly that is all he can do at the moment). The difference is Scholes had Ronaldo and Valencia at his peak to pick out. Rooney has Mata who can't wait to pass the ball back in the direction it came from.

5855~~~
He can try something else you know, like pass forward.

5856~~~
LVG is not a fool he sees what is going on. There is no way our present set up could have any form of success in the CL. Next season Rooney's role will be greatly diminished.
Finally people are seeing what I have said all along about Rooney or at least more are getting brave enough to speak up without fear of being branded blasphemous.

5857~~~
I completely agree and this is becoming obvious to everyone two years after Sir Alex knew it. I hope that he leaves the club soon or accepts a limited role.

5858~~~
If you put him on the right then he's just going to stand there pinging the ball into the crowd. He has nothing else in his locker but a long pass to right at the minute.

Edit: Bollocks I've quoted the wrong person. Apologies.

5859~~~
Agreed. Wouldn't hold my breathe though; he's been like this for a while.

5860~~~
He has gone from a 'Silent Dominator' to just being silent. Seems like both on and off the pitch. What happened to those famous pregame speeches? Needs to start giving them again.

5861~~~
He is one of those players that will be a bit of a mystery to me. I honestly cant make up my mind if he is a great player, or a good player in great teams. He will go on to be United and Englands top scorers and I will still think, he could have actually been so much more.

5862~~~
He can't play in this conditions, kick him out and put in Wilson

5863~~~
This seems like the best time to cash in on him to save his legacy imo.

5864~~~
Not according to Ferguson appearently. 

But if he is, at what level? What I have seen from him lately as a centre forward, there won't be much offers from big clubs.

5865~~~
If he's not upfront, I would drop him.

5866~~~
Perhaps his knee injury playing a factor?

5867~~~
When Rooney plays well, he plays well but god when he's average he's just plain average. He's having less and less of those good games as he's getting older. Let's all remember that he will be 30 two months into the new season.

5868~~~
For me, this is one of my biggest beefs with LVG this year: this rod he's created for his own back, insisting that Rooney must play. In the future, that simply can't be the case.

5869~~~
Watching him in midfield is just painful but since we have no one else really, what can we do? We seriously need to strengthen our midfield 3 for next season. Bring in Gündogan and Xhaka or Schneiderlin and we will even get through a Carrick injury without having to suffer Rooney in midfield.

5870~~~
I predict he will be sold to an MLS team this summer or the next for decent money.

5871~~~
At 29 years old? Behave.

5872~~~
Problem isn't Rooney. It's the fact that we don't create much. Young and Mata, even during their impressive patch, hardly created a chance for our forward/s. It's no surprise that RvP looked better when playing in midfield, he was actually able to exercise his left foot from outside the box.

5873~~~
The Rooney era needs to end. Should have ended a couple of years ago.

5874~~~
He clearly can't play for us anymore. Not a midfielder and not scoring enough to reach the top level. He's holding us back and doesn't merit a regular starting place.

If we want to sell him, there won't be many takers for his salary/ability ratio. MLS is a great fit where he can have a big salary and lots of attention in a Beckham Mk. II type of deal. We could even get a decent fee out of it.

Maybe Portland Timbers? The climate would be very familiar. I'm sure Colleen would love it there.

5875~~~
I am inclined to agree. As a striker he simply isnt prolific enough - compare him to any of the main strikers for other top teams and he comes up short.

In midfield he is just not very good. His performance today reminded me of how cleverley used to play

5876~~~
His performances bother me less than his role as captain. I thought he was meant to be fiery, a born leader, an on-pitch manager? I know we don't watch his every move for 90 mins, but I see very little of this when shit hits the fan.

5877~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5878~~~
Should be playing CF not Van Persie.

5879~~~
His numbers have been and are fine ffs. We barely create openings for our strikers and people expect to bin them and for a new one to somehow instantly come in and score. Fellaini is a hindrance to the forward in that sense, Mata has never been amazingly creative - he is more of a second striker and in this set-up creates very little, and Young's end product is spikey.

5880~~~
He's a better centre forward than he is midfielder, that's for sure. But, either way, he's in decline and has been for a couple of years. We need a more dynamic, younger centre forward.

5881~~~
You can't think of Rooney as a player like RVP that looks after himself and can play into his 30's at the top level.

5882~~~
True, Sir Alex saw it. For some inexplicable reason Moyes tried to build a team around him. Apparently selling him to Chelsea would have made us look weak, instead we weakened outselves by handing a player on the decline a massive 5 year contract. We should have swappened him for Mata in the first place.

5883~~~
Needs to play upfront if not drop Fellaini and play him behind the striker, really wasted in midfield simply not good enough there.

5884~~~
So we are back to the same type of posts we read about Rooney in the summer. For a while it looked like Rooney finally won over the Caf.

5885~~~
It's not because of his age and by the way he will be 30 at the start of next season. I think he's having too many average performances when it really matters.

5886~~~
He fails to impress over a season these days. Doesn't turn up in many matches. He is getting the same treatment Giggs use to get. It is not that he is a bad player, he just doesn't have the consistency that one would expect from someone we thought would be WC. How I dream of the Rooney that joined us, fire, raw passion, fearless. Maybe I am too biased, I just see someone in his comfort zone, knowing he isn't going to be dropped, so doesn't put in the extra few % that he has stored up.

5887~~~
Hes useless for our team when hes not in the box as he kills our momentum moves. 

As soon as he gets the ball, no matter where he is on the ball, you know what he will do, ping it out to the wing, mostly to Valencia. Even if hes on the edge of the box he will ping it out wide to a player who cant cross the ball lol.

5888~~~
He has not been great in recent weeks but, that is explained by two factors that have been constant since he has been here. One he is crap in matches player in Liverpool and he is crap when played in midfield. So I am not overly worried about his recent form. I think one of the main past times here is to say Wayne Rooney is past it so some are overreacting to his recent performances.

5889~~~
He is not past it by any means, but he is very indisciplined. Even when he is up front he often comes out of position, looking for the ball ...etc. Fergie said that is why he moved him to the side and midfield. LVG said Rooney may be the best scorer, but he does not play the striker role well.

5890~~~
TBF, he wasnt great against City or Liverpool either. And except his fantastic goal against Villa, I remember people saying he wasnt great against them either (think his first touch gets slated a lot mostly cos its fair)

5891~~~
Finished as a elite elite player for me. Needs to be benched next season whether as a forward or midfielder.

5892~~~
I honestly do not know how we become an elite team with Rooney as a focal point. He is a good CF and an average midfielder.

The same could be said for England. He is just too inconsistent to be a true attacking leader of a great team.

5893~~~
Probably agree. I think he's good enough as a striker for a team challenging for a top 4 place (which is what we completely are right now). But if you're looking for more from a striker I don't think Rooney has it. Having said that he should never be playing in midfield, seems to hamper everyone else who plays there.

5894~~~
Yep those were my thoughts at the time. You get slaughtered on here for having a go at 'The White Pele' but our eyes do not deceive us. A good all-rounder and we have more or less got our money's worth from him but just does not have the top quality any more that is required to be a striker for one of the 3 biggest clubs in the world.

5895~~~
Well him struggling against Liverpool would fit into his general tendency to struggle in matches in Liverpool. We scored 4 goals against City so even if he was not great he definitely did not hinder us. And his first touch is inconsistent that is something you have to just accept especially if he scores a goal like the one he scored against Villa.

5896~~~
He is a hindrance for this club going forwards if we want to play dynamic winning football. We need a fast technically gifted striker not a cumbersome former great player who can nick goals but isnt going to cut it at the very highest level

5897~~~
Oh no doubt, id rather see him up front and if hes not up front, then not in the team at all (if it means we play an actual player in their proper position, even if its a youngster). Hes not the Rooney that we signed. I wouldnt be scared to face him if I was a defender. Every time he gets the ball, you know what he will do or where hes looking to pass it.

5898~~~
Do MLS teams even sign well known players from Europe that are still within contract? Likes of Beckham, Lampard and Gerrard have all moved there at the end of theirs

5899~~~
Still better than the younger version of Rooney. With the younger version of Rooney the defender did not know what he was going to do with the ball but, then again neither did Rooney.

5900~~~
Is it though? That Rooney would give us movement, would run at players, and woudl occupy players freeing up space for others whilst also look to link with the striker rather than ping it out wide in slow motion to the winger.

5901~~~
He would also commit a lot of stupid fouls, give the ball away more and was not a consistent finisher.

5902~~~
He had a better first touch, could shoot / score from outside the box, was better one on one with the keeper and didnt have to play in the box to be effective. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> <a class="username" data-user="77930, @Keeps It tidy" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/77930/">@Keeps It tidy</a>

5903~~~
Qatar it is, then.

5904~~~
This.  The question is though, what club would buy him and give him half the wages he gets at united.
Truth is we are stuck with him.  He'll hold us back for a while yet.

5905~~~
It made me really happy when he did that Kagawa style fake move through his legs against Mulumbu and started great counter-attack, only to make me cry two seconds later when he ruined everything by trying stupid and pointless long ball to Mata which was intercepted despite having few players running through the middle. It was such an idiotic decision for which I would sub him off immediately.

5906~~~
Rooney is a tough player to judge. Great career which was/is full of superb moments but he's too often completely ineffective.

Maybe it's an element of playing out of position but IMO the praise he gets from many people, pundits especially, doesn't match with the player I see every week.

He's not finished by any means and is an important member of the squad but I think we should at least look at other players (Mata for instance) in his no 10 role.

5907~~~
I'd take him in a heartbeat at Chelsea. Can take Oscar's place in our first XI and play as a second striker just behind Costa. Think he'd score loads for us and has great work ethic when he's arsed.

Mourinho loves him as a player from what I've heard too. No chance it would ever happen, of course, because if he joined us and became world class again (which I think he would) it would make you guys look terrible.

5908~~~
You were only interested last time because his contract hadn't long to run and you thought you'd get him cheap.  No way would Chelsea spend more than £20-25 million on him.

5909~~~
He'd be an absolute steal for that price. We'll have more money to spend than ever before with our new sponsorships and increased revenue and prize money from winning the league. Plus the new TV money soon.

5910~~~
Yep he'll be the last to go from the guys who need replacing. The only club who would come in would be arsenal but considering the direction they are headed we can not strengthen them in any way.

5911~~~
If you think he would be world class playing as a number 10 behind Costa than you clearly haven't been watching much of Mr Rooney these last few years. He's a decent number 9 and that's it. And there's no chance of him usurping costa there. Unless you are mental.

5912~~~
Chelsea would play him up top, supported by Hazard, Fabregas and Matic. Without the burden of creativity on him, he'll be a very good player for them.

Our problem is, we're trying to make him something he's not. Playing him in midfield does not get the best out of him. A few years ago he was a wide forward and supporting Ronaldo but I doubt he can do that nowadays. He's just a very good striker these days.

5913~~~
He's very poor in midfield,  largely because he isn't really that good a player anyway in my opinion. Persie is obviously the more technical and skilful player, hence even he performing  better in midfield. He is a better manipulator of the ball up front, and naturally the same in midfield. 

I've maintained all season that all three of our strikers are not good enough anymore. Watching Rooney play up top, yes - he isn't awful but you still wouldn't get the hype if you had only read of his profile. If I had a choice I would even rather Benteke lead the line for us, and even he is only Benteke. 

Rooney has a bigger profile than the likes of Suarez and Aguero, and is paid similarly to Messi and Ronaldo. He is vastly overrated, and an 18 goal striker at best today I'd say, and that includes penalties.

5914~~~
None of that is true, and just rhetoric his apologists have used for ages. He doesn't have the 'burden of creativity ' in this team, he hasn't been turned into a midfielder, there are obviously circumstances, and a few years ago, he was no wide forward. He was always a striker, bar the few games he switched with Ronaldo for tactical reasons. He was simply a striker that was being g outscored by a (very exceptional ) winger.

5915~~~
This.

5916~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

5917~~~
He's not a midfielder. He's not even close to being a midfielder.

5918~~~
Can we get this started on Twitter or something? Portland Timbers preparing a surprise summer bid for Rooney, funded by local business Nike. Massive commercial potential with the Rooneys given their own family reality show in the mold of The Osbournes. We'll play Portland on the summer tour and Rooney will play one half for us and one half for them as a final goodbye. Will need to happen before we change over to Adidas.

5919~~~
I think there is some truth to the posts that say it's difficult to build a modern attacking brand of football around him at nearly 30, but he's captain and unlikely to be going anywhere so the best case scenario is we keep him as the #9 and flank him with pace and creativity, we have to avoid him in midfield at all costs.

5920~~~
Like nearly every week, ill go into this discussions in the hope that one day the jarheads will say "myeee hes pretty average nowadays".

Rooney played shit, this week, the week before, the week before that and that that that.

In an ideal world, Man United would be without Rooney. He isn't world class as a sole striker anymore, he is nowhere near world class in CAM. The only spot he can actually truly be world class in at this age and with his play style is a box to box midfielder in a 3 man midfield which he and the fans hate. Where does this leave him? On the bench.

Get a new striker, and for godsake get someone creative in the spot of Fellaini.

What we are doing is patching a broken tire with a bandaid both with Rooney and Fellaini in the team every week. Just buy a goddamn new tire.

5921~~~
I am far from a Rooney apologist. I actually wanted him out last season. But he is (was?) a very good striker. The season after Ronaldo left where he was more of a traditional striker was a good season for him in my opinion.

Playing him in midfield is a terrible idea that only the people who buy into the Rooney hype think will work. I'd play him up top, but I prefer RVP as striker. But Van Gaal's captain is never dropped, so there's a conundrum for you. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5922~~~
Why stay in a loveless marriage?

5923~~~
i don't expect rooney will leave because he has nowhere to go.  rooney onward should only be treated as another squad member just like young, fellaini, mata, herrera... etc despite he still enjoys a privilege to start a game if everything in par

5924~~~
Silent domination.

Neville got the silent part spot on.

5925~~~
Because he was never ever a good 10. His creativity only goes as far as that right wing floated ball to Valencia. Throw in his Shiteous close control and touch and it's easy to see why Persie is better

5926~~~
To be fair, Chelsea are smart people.

5927~~~
He shouldn't be insulted like that, its better to sell him.

5928~~~
Though it's not his fault that the manager plays him in midfield. He should be played as a #9.

5929~~~
His 56 assists for United suggest you're talking out your hole. 

Feck knows how people saw Van Persie as playing any better in midfield yesterday. He did feck all. Not that Rooney was any better. He was gash too. Turns out playing specialist strikers in central midfield isn't a great idea. Who'd have thunk it?

5930~~~
One of the worst desicions moyes made was giving him a wage to rival messi and Ronaldo.

Hes been declining for awhile now and because of his ridiculous wage we are stuck With him now. We should've sold him the second time he spat his dummy out.

Yes he's been good for us in the past of course but we ain't getting the 24-28 year old rooney back. It's only downhill from here.

5931~~~
135 all comps!

5932~~~
We should sell Rooney and get that Japanese lad from Dortmund and build around him.

5933~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Wasn't that what Ferguson wanted to do?

5934~~~
Ah, Not Allowed was great.

5935~~~
Don't be blind Pogue. I know you love him but it's clear as day that he's not suited to anywhere but the strikers role. So what if he's got 56 assists? I can't remember for the life of me his most recent DECENT (I'm not asking for much here) number 10 performance. He's played for us for a long time, the statistics of course are going to look pretty. It's not criminal to state facts; he's nowhere near the level we need him to be, and certainly let not up to par with other players in the same position. You'd honestly take him over Silva/Coutinho/Oscar/Aguero/Sanchez? Come on get real

5936~~~
Alimony?

5937~~~
What? Rvp was miles better in midfield mate. He actually raised our tempo and played a key part in the period where we actually threatened them and played with urgence, passing forwards and not the usual floated ball to Valencia. I doubt Rooney has done something noteworthe for the passed 3 games.

5938~~~
Who are these Chelsea?

5939~~~
It's a football club in London.

5940~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Pretty much.

5941~~~
He'd be very good for you in your current style. 

Playing as a No 10 in a possession based system doesnt suit him especially when the opposition park the bus, he's not good enough creatively.

5942~~~
I would absolutely love to see Chelsea sign Rooney and play him in a creative role. 

Imagine Hazard standing on the left wing looking confused while Rooney spends the whole game booting the ball to the other side of the pitch.

5943~~~
Exactly.

His creativity is just a cross field pass to Valencia. 5 assists this season is appalling for him. Di Maria has managed twice as much and he has been worse.

5944~~~
But but they've all been mishit shots and crap passes.

5945~~~
Chelsea can take Rooney and give us Costa instead.

A RvP who has been out for ages was miles better yesterday than Rooney. And RvP wasn't actually great yesterday, just much more useful than Rooney.

5946~~~
Some are just too stubborn. We all have our favourites but there comes a time, for the good of the team that we all love, that we face the fact Rooney is just not the player many think or hoped he would be.
Use stats, argue as much as you want but the fact is Rooney is not a skillful player. We no longer have a world class defense or midfield so its up to special players to come through for us. De Gea saved us a lot this season. Carrick is not very skillful but he obviously has a good understanding of the game and is creative. Rooney is hardworking and passionate but please for the good of the team his role has to that of a subordinate. Not a leader and definitely not our main man. I am tired of the hyperbole. If he scores or has an assist he automatically becomes WC. If he does not contribute he is crap. The reality is that he is a good player with certain strengths and certain weaknesses. Definitely not WC and cannot be the focal point of a successful team.

5947~~~
It would be a terrible decision by us, alright. Won't happen though.

5948~~~
He may have a future at United but United won't have much of a future with him as a main main. 09-11 was his peak as a player. He is declining but this is not obvious to his fans because he is still capable of playing very well for 2-3 months per season. Generally, he's been poor/average in the second half of the season several years in a row. Last season, after having a good first half of the season, he slumped into mediocrity in the second half. This season, he was good for several months (November-January) and then became average again.

5949~~~
What? You are never happy when some player does a nice dummy?

Van Persie was better for 60 minutes as a striker than Rooney was in any of his last 5 or 6 games and was better in midfield for the last 30 minutes than Rooney was even though he looked really tired in those last 30 minutes and this was his first game after injury. But you'll never admit that even though everyone agrees with it.

5950~~~
I won't admit it because its nonsense, believed by idiots. Carry on.

Which is not to say Rooney has been anything other than poor in his last two games. Which he has.

5951~~~
You just say Rvp wasnt better, but you dont argue why. Who looks like the idiot by doing that, when most people agree Rvp was fairly good and Rooney has been poor?

5952~~~
He wasn't great yesterday, but I think it's a little harsh to over-slate him when he's not playing up front. It's not his fault that he's being forced to play in midfield with Carrick out. There aren't many other options.

The sooner he's back up front, the better.

Not sure why he didn't take yesterday's penalty too. I know it's easy to say that in hindsight, but I was surprised that he's given up penalty duties.

5953~~~
They were much of a muchness in midfield. RvP was better as a striker than Rooney was against Everton. But that's not hard. 

Bizarre that people are feeling so vindicated by such a mediocre performance. Obviously, Rooney was worse but people are really clutching at straws with the praise Van Persie is getting where he so obviously failed in his primary job.

5954~~~
He didnt score, that's true. But you have to admit he was really threatening, hold up the ball wel, made good runs and was fairly good on the ball. I dont think people said he played great, but he played well I think and showed composure in the match (bar the penalty ofcourse), with all the criticism he's got this season, it's also fair to give him praise when he plays well. (Not great).

5955~~~
Which Rooney failed in his 5 out of last 6 games?

5956~~~
Ah the Rooney out brigade is back then. Good to see

5957~~~
Not per se Rooney out, peole think he should get a lesser role and not be our focal point.

5958~~~
Unfortunately, the many poor performances we've seen this season (and last) means it will take a really good performance to allay concerns that he's a busted flush. A much better performance than we saw yesterday, anyway. I wanted him to start and I really hope he can turn things round again. I'm no more confident about that now than I was before kick off. Which is disappointing and makes it hard to understand the positivity in the RVP thread. 

This is the Rooney thread, though. He looks to have hit a wall. Not been good for a while. Just a pity there's so little top class competition for his place in the team. Even playing out of position. That's a worry.

5959~~~
So it's nonsense because you don't agree with it? No one is surprised he had yet another stinker CM, and that's not his fault, that's on Van Gaal. The thing that bother people, was his complete lack of desire, commitment and leadership yesterday. Are we holding Rooney to a higher standard than for example Herrera and Young? You damn right we are. He earns 300k/week, is our captain and supposed main man. 

Everyone has poor games now and then. That's alright. What is not alright is our bloody captain not looking arsed when we are losing at home to WBA and CL football is a stake.

5960~~~
You mean Rooney brigade as everyone with healthy eyes except you and Pogue?

5961~~~
He's been poor for a while now wherever he's played. It's crunch time of the season, he's a senior player, a captain and he's been absolutely anonymous - and against big opposition too. 

Didn't offer anything yesterday. Not even hard work. His only notable contribution was slowing the play down by spreading it wide (often needlessly) and not even executing it well. 

2? 

Liverpool, City, Villa, Chelsea, Everton, West Brom. That's 6 straight performances where he was mediocre at best (Villa - because of the goal).

5962~~~
Also, I find the narrative that Rooney has had a good season, only held back by playing in midfield to be mind-boggling. I see it a lot in here but through the media too.

He's been a good captain, I'll give him that. Though he's hardly lead by example of late. But past that - it doesn't matter what position, what system, what role - he's offered up no semblance of consistency, he's barely performed in the big games, and he's hardly ever made the difference that you'd expect him too.

This isn't meant to be some definitive prove of his poor season, but I find it interesting that on Whoscored he's been our MOTM just once this season. Last season, 6 times. It's probably an easy thing to dismiss, but if you were to consider who the most influential players are in the league, they've all got plenty, bar Fabregas - but he's had to compete with Hazard, Matic and Costa.

5963~~~
I agree.

5964~~~
Mind-boggling? That's exactly what's happened. He's had good and bad games as a striker (like most strikers) but having to repeatedly drop back into midfield has obviously been hugely detrimental to his form as a number 9.

In midfield he's had a handful of quite good performances but generally been a bit meh. It's blatantly not his position.

All of which contributes to an underwhelming season, mainly through no fault of his own. That's not a narrative, that's actually what happened.

EDIT: although if your issue is with him being perceived to have had a "good season" overall then fair enough.

5965~~~
Except your conclusion is an underwhelming season because of being in midfield, whereas the one I referred is a good season - despite the games in midfield. 

He's been moved around the pitch and played the deeper position plenty under Fergie and Moyes too and would still win us games and put in MOTM performances. He would be frustrating, but he was still influential and effective. The only real mitigating factor here is that Van Gaal has taken the first-touch and poor passing frustration away by making him more cautious and more possession orientated.

However, he had what - 6 consecutive games up front? Arsenal, Newcastle, Spurs, Liverpool, City, Villa - the last 3 he was poor, despite being given a consistent run. I think the midfield being detrimental to his form up front is a guess at causation with no real substantial proof. Particularly in light of your 'no excuses for Di Maria, two 30-minute appearances should be enough for a player of his quality', another player constantly moved about, taken out the team, being given different roles - what's Rooneys excuse?

5966~~~
His long lofted pass out wide right is too predictable. I mean, the opposition LB could start running to cut off the pass before Rooney even gets the ball. He's such an instinctive player in other positions but in CM he seems robotic and just bland.

5967~~~
Rooney is certainly not finished but is also not good enough to be what we build our next side around, he should be a part of it, not the heartbeat. 
My biggest issue with Rooney isn't actually Rooney, it's his managers, from saf for most of his time, to moyes to lvg to Capello to hodgeson, not one of them drops him during his annual spell of poor form, not one. They all trot out the "he needs games to find his form" schtick, so do most players but they don't get that luxury.
Mata and Herrera, both dropped when they aren't playing well, our record signing and most creative player...likewise. Rooney? No chance in hell, not even against Everton where even his biggest supporters can't deny starting him is like playing with ten men.

5968~~~
6 games up front. Excellent in half of them. That'll do. Not as though he was missing handfuls of chances in those other games, the barometer that is usually used to judge a striker. 

Re Di Maria, if he'd put in a single performance against decent opposition as good as Rooney against, say, Spurs then I'd be much much happier with his United career to date.

Not to mention that Rooney's cv at the club speaks for itself. So it's weird that you're drawing comparisons with someone who may or may not succeed in the Premier League at all, never mind make a similar impact to Roney. Rooney has nothing left to prove, so it makes sense to look for mitigating circumstances if he's not hitting his usual heights. Di Maria still has it all to prove and, like I said, if he'd come close to matching Rooney's performances in - for him - an underwhelming season then that would be plenty good enough. Unfortunately, he hasn't done that.

5969~~~
Bang on mate.

5970~~~
One of my biggest fear was LVG putting Rooney back into midfield. Lo and behold..

5971~~~
Just play him upfront. Even when he's off his game he still regularly scores a goal (Villa) or gets an assist (City). Plus his work rate and pressing is invaluable for forcing errors and winning the ball high up the pitch. Things that directly contribute to chances and goals.

It was such a massive plus for us when RvP got injured and Van Gaal was forced to play him upfront. Amazing how quickly he's gone back to his failed experiment rather than continue with what works.

5972~~~
Rooney offers nothing. Time to cash in me thinks.

5973~~~
Not going to happen, I don't see any elite clubs needing him right now and his ego/greed wouldn't allow him to take a step down

5974~~~
As soon as Moyes gave him that deal we got ourselves into a poor position. We have a commitment to 'build our team' (can expression I hate) around a player who is struggling to cement a place in even the second tier of top players in the game.

He is paid at the level of a Ballon D'or contender, and he's further away from that award than Fabien fecking Delph in reality.

5975~~~
To be fair to Van Gaal, his hand was forced by the injury to Carrick and lack of a decent alternative in central midfield. Although his responsibility for this fiasco depends on how involved he was in assessing Di Maria's ability to become a reliable PL midfielder on his debut season.

5976~~~
He's the elephant in the room.

He isn't the top class #9 we need if we want to kick on, and he isn't that good in midfield.

5977~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You are my favourite poster ever. I don't think even Cal defends Ronaldo that much, and Ronaldo is on another planet to Rooney.

5978~~~
He'll always keep up highish scoring and assist numbers playing up front. Problem is we need more from him. The one up top playing for Manchester United will always rack up decent stats. (Look at Hernandez or Berbatov). It's just painfully obvious he just doesn't cause defenders too much to worry about these days. His best attributes for me was always pace and power, that seems to be less of a feature in his game now. This current version of Rooney is painfully overrated and this bullshit about LvG's captain always playing the 90 mins has caused us problems. There are just so many excuses that are afforded to him that arent given to other players, f.x. he needs 4-5 games to get back into rhythm, he isn't playing his position.

5979~~~
There's a middle ground, I think we have dug a hole for ourselves by making him Captain as now he always has to play regardless of form. To me he still has plenty to offer as a striker but not in any of the other roles he gets shoehorned into because he has to play no matter what.

5980~~~
Shhh! We only deal in extremes here.

5981~~~
He really needs to show more. He's been shit recently

5982~~~
I am starting to feel this way as well. Compare him to the main strikers for other teams - Aguero, Costa, Sturridge, Kane, Sanchez (sort of)...Rooney just falls short unfortunately.

There is no way he would accept being relegated to a squad player at this stage in his career though, especially after LVG made him captain this season. For me, I would see if we could attract a big money offer from the likes of PSG, and look to buy a top quality #9 to lead our line.

5983~~~
Rooney is not going anywhere. You guys are just going have to accept that

5984~~~
I agree. But since he is captain he is guaranteed a starting spot. It's a bad situation really.

5985~~~
He needs to up his game again. He's been poor recently and not offering enough movement or creativity.

5986~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/man-utds-wayne-rooney-robin-9173961" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/man-utds-wayne-rooney-robin-9173961</a>

LVG has effectively taken out both Rooney and RVP of penalty duty.

5987~~~
Looks like this is heading into the same situation Liverpool have with Gerrard. Club legend who's in decline carries on getting picked as he's the captain. Not say he's as bad as Gerrard but it looks like he will carry on playing for the next four years regardless of form.

5988~~~
Good.
I am very interested to see how long his patience lasts' with Rooney. Seems to be losing a bit with his friend RVP. Rooney is simply not consistent enough nowadays and this is a problem for us. This is actually the reason why SAF wanted him to go - he could see what would happen. Also, him playing regardless of how bad he is will cause a bit of resentment from his team mates who are dropped the moment they stop performing. I don't know what we do, it's a big expensive mess and I doubt Rooney will want to play a bit part in the team.

5989~~~
Planet? Try universe

5990~~~
I'd say the mess was created by Moyes but honestly, Van Gaal made it worse by making him his undroppable captain. I wonder if that'll change.

5991~~~
I still think its part of LVG's original plan of giving everyone a chance to prove themselves. He gave Rooney an entire season to prove he was worthy of an undroppable status. Having failed I don't think anyone will complain when Rooney's role is revised for next season.

5992~~~
Yeah I would say that is a pretty good comparison actually.

5993~~~
I think the time has come for rooney to be demoted to a bench player. He can't affect games like he used to. 

It's time we got a proper striker in the costa, aguero and benzema mould. We need a striker that can guarantee 20+ goals a season, none of our lot can anymore.

5994~~~
Neither him, RVP or Falcao deserve place up-front, for various reasons.

He's good at captaining, our players like him and he's well respected among players from other clubs, but captain armband gave him undroppable status which no one should have, especially not in the team like United where you only play if you're good enough, not for some sentimental or other reasons.

5995~~~
When Rooney has the ball in midfield, you can be sure that it will end up at the feet of Mata or Valencia.

5996~~~
I'm pretty convinced that if he was played at #9 all the time, he's be getting 20 goals a season. Messing his position around is really annoying, to me. He's not a midfielder, and if we really wanted to turn him into one, it'd take a whole season, not a streak of 5-6 games before being put back into the attacker's position again.

People are harsh on Rooney and don't take into account how disturbing it must be for a pro player to play in radically different positions on such a frequent basis. 

I agree he shouldn't be a starter in midfield though.

5997~~~
He's got 14 this season and still been largely shit. Scoring goals isn't the whole problem, when played as a striker he's been anonymous and his hold up play has been so shockingly bad that we have to play Fellaini up there with him to actually hold the ball up. So even when he is up front he is hampering the midfield because we need to play Fellaini instead of a more creative player to make up for Rooney's shortcomings. If he could perform well in one of his positions he might not get moved around so much.

He's a good finisher and will score goals when given chances, but so will a lot of other strikers that offer more than Rooney currently does.

5998~~~
He's not been largely shit.

5999~~~
Moving positions from month to month (week to week on some occasions) must really make it difficult in some senses for a footballer, especially when you are not proficient or well practised in one of them. This can explain tactical and positional confusion and even a loss of confidence but goes no way to explaining a drop in general footballing skills. Poor control and touch can't be excused by this and they remain some of the core criticisms of Rooney. Many people go over the top but he is performing significantly below his best.

Wayne could bag 20+ goals a season as a striker but so could Hernandez, Rooney needs to up his game and start showing a lot more if he wants to be the main man in the future as it is becoming increasingly difficult to paper over his short comings with the occasional moment of magic he produces. I don't think he has it in him but would be delighted for him to prove me wrong.

6000~~~
Don't even bother. Some average games in midfield and the revisionism is going to start again as far as Rooney is concerned.

6001~~~
I do think his all-round game has gone down but his work-rate is still top notch (he was uncharacteristically underwhelming in this aspect in the last game though - the knock having an effect on him?) and his ability to combine with players (up top) is still very good whilst he is still clinical. I get that many will claim that work-rate isn't a quintessential quality for a top notch centre-forward but it isn't too bad a quality to have, esp when considering how our midfield lacked a reliable defensive presence during the mid stretch of the season. Granted, he wasn't the best player on the ball in midfield (naturally, since he isn't a midfielder) but I thought he was solid defensively and you always knew what you were getting with Rooney in midfield (immense workrate, ability to track runners, decent one on one defensively etc).

I was actually surprised at the tactical discipline he showed as a central midfielder; he wasn't constantly making needless runs forward, in line with his instincts as a striker but rather showed restraint and stuck to his responsibilities fairly well. We did not properly utilize his qualities fully in midfield but I always did find him to be a fairly solid if unspectacular presence (one could argue that was exactly what we needed during that particular stretch where the other midfielders were fairly porous off the ball - if you will). If anything his work on the ball has been overly criticised (justified to a certain extent) but his off the ball work during his stint in midfield has gone under gone under the radar imo.

I do think some do have a point in that he isn't exactly someone who you build the team around in the way you would around a talismanic Suarez, Aguero, Ibrahimovic etc but he can be a valuable player without necessarily being the star player. I can still see him being a quality player (one of the best in the league in his position without necessarily being the best) with a good supporting cast behind him. Rooney doesn't have the sheer dynamism or the same awe-inspiring ability to take a game by the scruff of the neck that he did before but there is no need to make him out to be a 'squad player' etc. He hasn't pulled up any trees during his stint at centre-forward this season (tbf to him he has constantly been rotated in different positions and hasn't had a consistent run up front) but he was still adequate enough in most of those performances. Obviously he needs to show more up top but I'll wait till he has a constant run up top with a balanced and quality set-up - which he obviously has to contribute to and not just be a part of - before completely writing him off as being past it.

Btw for all those saying we should replace him, who out there is available? Not Lewa, Benzema, Aguero, Suarez etc. I've seen many mention Dybala and Vietto but they aren't proven at the highest of levels and are budding youngsters - who you can't just put straight into the first team and expect results straight away.

Agreed. People are being overly harsh on Rooney - statements like him being a squad player/need to be sold etc are simply over the top.

6002~~~
His best game was against Tottenham. Otherwise, during <i>that</i> run, he wasn't anything like our best player. In fact, he was pushing Valencia for least impressive player. He was completely anonymous against both City (don't care what Neville says) and Liverpool. Aston Villa - he scored a beauty, but his overall play was average.

It wasn't because we had Rooney up front that we played better, it's because we didn't have Rooney in midfield. I think people underestimate how bad he is there.

6003~~~
He's been really poor lately and couldn't complain if he's benched. What really irks me though is to see him play without fire and not really fighting and giving his all. That's not like him

6004~~~
Sure it has been discussed but what do we do with him? Not a top class striker anymore, and never was, or will be a top midfielder.

Surely he can't be benched as the captain, and highest paid player, so if we get a top class striker in the summer where is he going to fit in?

6005~~~
That's totally like him. Like a clockwork, year after year he's always had this period of not being arse in games. Even if he breaks Charlton's goalscoring record, he'd never be a United legend for me (although I'm not sure he'll lose sleep because of that <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>).

6006~~~
We're not going to get a top class striker in the summer. He'll play as the default #9 next year and will shine in the position. We'll reinforce other areas of the team in the summer where we need stronger options.

6007~~~
Rooney has been in gradual decline for a few years now, and this is not going to reverse.  A combination of body shape, lack of fitness-discipline and 'miles on the clock' mean that this decline is a bit sooner than players like RVP.

If we have any ambitions of challenging for top trophies we need someone younger and more dynamic up front.  Whether Rooney is willing to stay in more of a squad-player capacity without the captaincy (and really, on lower wages) is up to him.

Edit: he's still been our best striker this season (not saying much) but this is not the same as being good enough

6008~~~
Pretty much this tbh. Still our best striker this season, but I think we need to go and look for a good youngish player to come in for Falcao to push Rooney and RVP

6009~~~
Easily our best bet as striker and we're unlikely to get a better one either. Should be nowhere near the midfield though. Let's hope carrick/blind being fit solves that.

6010~~~
Good post, I find it unbelievable that peoples standards have dropped so far that Rooney is still seen as an elite level striker... having the likes of Falcao/RVP as competition has made people think we still have an Aguero/Suarez level striker on our hands. He is far from that.

I am grateful that we still have him for this season but by this summer, we need a brand new strikeforce, it is imperative that Rooney becomes a squad player for me as he is not the guy we need up top if we want to be winning the title or making a mark in the Champions League.

6011~~~
Agreed. I was called crazy a while ago for saying that Rooney should be phased out... because apparently this is his 'peak'.

But I completely agree. Let this new team really take shape, and rid ourselves of Rooney and van Persie. Unfortunately this wont happen, but it should do. If Rooney has to stay (which I guess he does), I'd phase him out.

I'm looking forward to the day Rooney and van Persie have both gone.

6012~~~
Totally agree, they are absolutely not worth their wages at the moment and I think they're hindrances rather than assets going forwards.

I am all for keeping experienced strikers but a guy like Drogba who features here and there when Costa is out is very different to having a slightly past his peak Drogba featuring week in week out based on his past reputation. 

Rooney has something to give no doubt, but he is not a starter for a elite club in europe material, he is just a decent striker now and unless he is willing to take a pay cut and accept a role as a backup, I would get shot of him for a decent fee while we can.

6013~~~
x 9999

6014~~~
haven't gone through this thread but people here still think that?

Because it's daft. Rooney isn't at that level and hasn't been for a long time. He simply doesn't have the dynamism right now. Hard to see him gaining it again too. I can see him at best giving us regular goals, and being sensible in his play. A top top striker does a lot more than that, for me.

6015~~~
He'll eventually find form and people will be singing his praises again, it's Rooney.

6016~~~
Decent is very harsh IMO. He's obviously still very good. Play him upfront all season and he should give you 20 plus goals. It's just that he has nothing special about him all apart from the decent strike every now and then. He can't run defences ragged. I can't even remember the last time him saw him and felt he destroyed defences, which all the top top strikers do.

But he's a level below IMO, and still a very good striker. Decent striker is what mid table strikers are

6017~~~
I don't really know what makes some posters so sure that Rooney will magically blossom next year as the default number 9. Why could he not do it this season? More specifically In our recent run of form when he played most games as a number 9 and was largely poor? And this was when the team was actually functioning properly and playing good stuff.

He is strong, works hard and holds the ball up well (most of the time) but his pace, ability to go past defenders and to stretch the opposition are and have been in rapid decline. But no it's the merseyside curse/ it's the silent domination/it's the rustiness from being the next thing to Gandhi and sacrificing himself by playing in midfield. Please, this is a 250k a week forward we are talking about.

He has become the jack of all trades and the master of none. That is not good enough for this club and where we are/want to be.

6018~~~
Wishful thinking though. I don't think there are many arguments to support that. We saw this season only that he can score from time to time, but he wasn't even consistent at scoring even though it's his best attribute. He scored one goal in his last 5 games as a striker. In few games where we actually played well he hardly had any shots at all. Same goes for season before this, and before this under Fergie. Basically, he hasn't showed in last three seasons that he is a top striker at all.
I think he is a good striker but he is far from top, top striker all top teams have. You have probably watched Juventus yesterday, and saw that Tevez put better performance than any of our strikers put this year, and that was against Real Madrid. Our strikers didn't look that lively even against shit sides.
I want to think we have top striker in Rooney too even though I like him because I don't see many top strikers <i>available </i>we could buy to push us on the same level as other top teams, plus it would mean that we would worry more about solving other important positions such as right fullback, or replacement for Carrick, but unfortunately we should definitely think about strikers position too. Or at least find a good back-up to Rooney who will at least offers us something different and is ready to replace him when he isn't in good form, which happens few months in every single season.

It doesn't help either that van Gaal doesn't prefer him as number #9 at all, and not just because he is great in midfield because we all know he isn't.

6019~~~
Spurs, at Old Trafford. Just over 7 weeks ago. 

Not aimed at you, personally, but that's typical of the goldfish memories on here. Ashley Young thread is similar. A handful of mediocre performances and it's as though everything that happened beforehand has been wiped from the record.

6020~~~
Mata's too.

It's been a recurring theme recently.

6021~~~
It was one good run but he just doesn't do what Suarez and aguero do, for me, which is frighten defenders at times. Costa did that for atletico too. Which is fine because he's still a very good player.

6022~~~
He has unfortunately become what Alan Shearer was to Newcastle United in his latter years. It remains obvious that he still has plenty to offer as a player but it is also obvious that he simply isn't the best at that. As a team we need far more dynamism in our play, particularly in the attacking third and sadly Wayne hasn't looked like providing it for at least three seasons now. Decisions to displace a powerful (both on and off the pitch) member of the squad like him are always incredibly, and rather paradoxically, difficult especially for stop-gap managers with less affiliation to clubs [than the player].  

Perhaps Rooney has become complacent over the years with his guaranteed starting spot, relative longevity, power in relation to having the ear of the management and marketing etc. This may indeed what SAF foresaw in his last season and tried to rectify by providing him with some competition and apparently relieving him of some "privileges". Having said that, however, Rooney just doesn't strike me as the sort of a player that responds well to a gauntlet especially at this late stage in his career. 

LVG needs to cast aside sentiments when he evaluates the squad at the end of the season, much like he swiftly did with the sale and/or loaning of several other long serving players last year. If the club truly wants to regain its place at the summit of world football then only the absolute rather than comparatively best players ought to be in our starting eleven. Finally, Rooney is not alone in this lull, it could be argued that our entire strike force needs replacing by the very same token, which is arguably more difficult in practice than in principle.

6023~~~
I've said it several times; he doesn't have the attributes to be a great player in any position. He goes through purple patches where you think that he's finally found his position and role, but then a month or two later he'll revert to type.

His biggest strengths aren't specific to any position and his biggest weaknesses are also none specific. This means he'll be a £25m solid player in any one of about 5 positions. The problem is we don't aspire to have merely decent-good players in any one of the front 5 positions, we aspire to have 5 great player's. Unfortunately Rooney is not a great player; he's a solid, versatile one.

I still think that he's fine as a second choice striker, he's fine as a second choice number 10, he's fine as a second choice inside forward and he's fine as a second or third choice number 8. The problem is none of our managers have yet had the stones to treat him as second choice. Fergie was going to before he retired, Moyes merely pandered to every big name and Van Gaal made him captain which as he said made him un-droppable.

Unfortunately we will see another 2-3 seasons at least of Rooney shoe-horned into any position that he's decent in and playing every week. Personally I'd stick him up front as at least he's a good finisher and works hard. He certainly is completely unsuited to playing Van Gaal's possession based game, so any other position isn't really viable.

6024~~~
It would be great to have a striker as good as Suarez or Aguero (minus the injuries) on our books, I agree. Very hard to sign that sort of quality, though. We've definitely lacked stardust since Ronaldo fecked off and Rooney's a bloody good player but not someone you build a CL winning team round. So yes, we're lacking a real superstar (and that's presumably why we signed Falcao and Di Maria) My beef is the way so many people are so quick to label Rooney a busted flush. It's ridiculous.

6025~~~
Moyes/Woody screwed us with that ridiculous contract, at least from a footballing perspective - although I maintain it was the right thing from an off the field point of view. If Fergie had stayed, Rooney would have been sold, most of his defenders on here would likely be like 'yea, he was passed his best', as it never the wrong decision to sell a player on here, although always wrong to criticise them and say they aren't great before they are sold.

Rooney going under Fergie would have been fine, because Fergie = stability, and he wouldn't be the first star he has sold before. However, under Moyes, and the narrative of 'United in crisis' - big 'names' losing would have sent a terrible message. It would look as if Rooney doesn't want to sign a new deal because of United's decline, and the wrong message would be sent.

I think we are deceiving ourselves though if we think that, in this Aguero, Costa, Sanchez etc age that Rooney can be enough of a danger to fire us back to the top? People are now coming up with the whole 'we need Bale/Depay and more goals from wide' stuff to help Rooney and mask the fact that his return is not good enough. At least the perfect mitigation was provided for those who want it in the shape of 5 or so games in midfield (in which he scored 2 of his 12 goals this season anyway if I'm not mistaken). Before that, they had multiplied his 20 max games out wide by 5 or 6 and changed the story to him being a winger while Ronaldo was here.

This will be LVGs biggest test over the coming yearsas to whether he is strong enough to drop his skipper. What is certain is that we need better, both in terms of goal output and approach play.

6026~~~
I've not been in the Mata thread, but I don't know how anyone can claim Mata has had a good season. For one, he's barely started, lest we forget he was certainly not in LVG's favour pre-Tottenham. Then he played during <i>The Run</i>; the Tottenham game he was outshone by Fellaini-Blind-Young; he was brilliant against Liverpool; he was good against City; he was good against Villa. That's three good games - and I think he had a few good ones earlier in the season (Liverpool at home) - but that doesn't qualify as a great season, by any stretch. 

And it's the exact same with Young. If you were to look at his games on a game-to-game basis, over the whole season, rather than during a little bit of a streak, you'd see he's had an average season by Manchester United standards, but a good season by Young-Of-Last-Two-Years standards.

6027~~~
You should really have a browse of the Welbeck and Pogba threads..

6028~~~
Thing is, for all of Rooney's flaws, there's really no benefit to selling/sidelining him. Which <i>attainable</i> striker out there is better than Rooney?

6029~~~
Welbeck has been laughed at and ridiculed all season on here, almost from the very week he was sold.  To be honest, I actually found it a bit disgusting the way many seemed to turn on him all of a sudden and come out with the 'yea, he was never good enough' stuff, although before hand, he was never on anyone's list to get rid.

Pogba probably started off similar. We all wanted him to stay, then once he left, there was 'well good luck to him if he wants to sit on Juve's bench behind Vidal, Pirlo, Marchisio etc', and how we are ell rid and he obviously thinks he's much better than he is. Bit ridiculous to maintain that  kind of rhetoric now though, hence the change.

6030~~~
Ever since he moved to midfield, we haven't been able to score goals. He may not have been scoring, but maybe his presence up top was helping?

6031~~~
Likely, or the other side to the story being, maybe with him not in midfield, the midfield is able to create... swings and roundabouts. Its likely to be some of both tbh

6032~~~
Agree with all of that.

I would like to see us try and sign someone younger who can be backup to rooney and stretch defenders and put some fear into centre backs without being as dependable. Sortof like Danny Welbeck without being anonymous in the final third.

6033~~~
Thanks, that's cleared that one up nicely for me.

6034~~~
Indeed. The best we've seen of Rooney at United was when he was able to link up with players that push defenders deep because they're frightened of pace. For all his flaws, Welbeck has been a far better foil for Rooney than any of our more senior strikers. I still think/hope Wilson could be that player and there's been glimpses of Rooney and Di Maria complementing each other on the pitch. We definitely need another option, though.

6035~~~
You're welcome, you don't even need to tune into the transfer forum this summer now! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6036~~~
No that's perfect, I can now focus on doing something more constructive in the summer.

I don't suppose you tell me the score for the game on Saturday too please? It's doing my head in wondering what's going to happen, so best just to get it out of the way.

Cheers

6037~~~
Wow, did I touch a sensitive nerve? You do realize I was only stating my opinion, yeah?

6038~~~
I was joking, & seriously expecting you to come back with a score.

No nerve been touched here just having a laugh..... o the wonders of the faceless Internet.

6039~~~
Ah sorry, misread you there! 

3-0 this weekend. Hat trick from Rooney, of course. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

6040~~~
Good on you.

You'd better be right though! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6041~~~
That is the thing, it is a very difficult question to answer but that is why we have a scouting team. They have to produce the goods here.. it is not good enough to just wait until a superstar pops up like a Suarez at Liverpool, we need to be buying guys like Suarez when he was at Ajax or Aguero at Atletico.. take an educated gamble on a striker who has the hallmarks of being the best and capable of adding genuine dynamism to our attack.

6042~~~
Every thread I enter people are saying we're shit, our players are shit and we need to sign a bunch of players.

6043~~~
"we're so shit it's unbelievable" was actually being sung on Saturday.

6044~~~
He still has 12 goals in the league even though he has spent half the season in midfield. I am perfectly fine with him as a CF. We just need to never ever play him in midfield again.

6045~~~
Hear here heer.

6046~~~
OP: change "knock-out" to "average/good" in the thread title.

6047~~~
He's been poor this season for me, but will probably get 20 goals next season if we sort out everything behind him and play him up front. Not many other strikers around you can say that for.

6048~~~
An average striker that is a stones throw away from becoming Manchester United's all time top goal scorer.

6049~~~
Even Giroud can. Giroud has as many goals as Rooney bte since Fergie retired. (PL). Every decent striker can score a fair amount with good service behind him, from Charlie Austin to Kane to Giroud, a great striker however, can force things out of himself and has the consistency to keep scoring. The run like Aguero made vs Spurs, Rooney hasnt been doing that for a while.

6050~~~
Also, most strikers are actually played in their position on a consistent basis. But let's compare stuff that shouldn't be, why not.

6051~~~
Remember how many headers he scored when our wingers were amazing?

We was like a mini Peter Crouch. 

It's still there.

6052~~~
Nope. You'd never see Rooney scoring against a team like Spurs with a run from deep.

6053~~~
Its about the run behind the defence, not a run with the ball. Aguero constantly creates chances for himself, by exploiting the space behind the defence. Rooney doesnt.

6054~~~
He's still heading the ball often. Though, it's mostly in our box!


Great defender. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

6055~~~
I think he has been playing with that knee injury that was supposedly cleared. I doubt we will see him play again this season.

6056~~~
Will he be back for the Arsenal game? Place your bets now.

6057~~~
Falcao played well towards the end of the game as he got more involved with the all round play. Hope Rooney doesn't rush from injury so that Falcao might finally get going( even if it is a bit late).

6058~~~

6059~~~
Rooney is finished as a top class footballer. 

He looks about 40 and plays like a drunk.

6060~~~
I wish I was being paid £300,000 per week at work and deliver like this <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6061~~~
Abysmal today. Again.

6062~~~
So much for the "he's better as no.9" shit...

6063~~~
We badly need another striker. Rooney has barely outscored Danny Ings this season.

6064~~~
He really is going to be our steven gerrard. If Fergie was here he would sell him.

6065~~~
Unfortunately I agree.

6066~~~
At some point, LVG will have to give Rooney the same treatment Mark van Bommel got when the latter was no longer fit to carry on at Bayern. Captain or not, he should not be invulnerable to the prospect of being benched.

6067~~~
Has to be a priority

6068~~~
He was awful today but it is pretty funny how in a game where so many others played poorly his is the only thread that instantly shoots the top of the section.

6069~~~
As bad as I've seen him play. Did nothing right.

6070~~~
As has been said a million times before, Rooney brings a lot more than goals.

I agree though. We're in dire need of another prolific goalscorer

6071~~~
Typical with Rooney, great on form, absolutely useless when off form. His consistency has always been a massive problem, you just never know what you're going to get.

6072~~~
Probably something to do with him being a mainstay in the starting 11 every week when playing crap more often than not.

6073~~~
Defenders find him easy to deal with now. He can't run behind and isn't a physical threat anymore.

6074~~~
What has be brought recently?

6075~~~
He was dreadful and even had a petulant kick out as well.

6076~~~
We need a striker.

6077~~~
He usually is bad after coming back from injury though. And the match was meaningless so I will cut him some slack.

6078~~~
I'm really worried about him being undroppable. He's been shite for weeks now.

6079~~~
Piss poor (again)....sometimes I wonder if he just can't be bothered anymore!!

6080~~~
He missed one game.

People will mention his goal record a United but he is regressing as much as our other strikers and it's becoming a problem. Even more so when he has to play every game.

6081~~~
He's the only one that LVG deems an automatic starter on the premise that he's captain. Both having that philosophy and making him captain are poor decisions in my opinion.

6082~~~
He wasn't really great in our six match run. Unless you listen to that nonsense from Neville about silent domination.

6083~~~
Ok? Still coming back from injury though. Anyway, I am just as worried about him as everyone. I was just pointing out some possible explanation.

6084~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Aand we didn't have to wait long for this one

6085~~~
Yeah I agree with that. This system simply doesn't suit a striker like him unfortunately.

6086~~~
LOL at the people boasting he's better than RvP when played upfront. After next season, he shouldn't be an automatic starter.

6087~~~
Yes in the past, occasionally. Play Rooney up top and he was supposed to be our best, most lethal striker. Been a good player for us but way past his best now.

6088~~~
Another awful performance, hope we replace him ASAP.

6089~~~
But is this typical of the current version of Wayne Rooney? I'd argue that he very rarely puts in great overall performances. On form he scores, but overall performances have been lacking quite consistently,

6090~~~
4 goals in 14 games up front, not good enough.

And brings more than goals - what and when? Not up front and not for a while.

6091~~~
he used to be a player who lifted all team now he's player who is absolutely dependable on team, he's useless now, his wonderstuff doesn't ake up for his Conference north league Touch and below that league movement. WOnder who could be slower RVP or him, we are really fecked as wee desperately need striker and if we get half decent striker than Rooney who shall play no matter what will be in midfeld again.. Should have got rid 3 years ago, every year he's more and more useless..

6092~~~
'When you play him as a no. 9 he'll get you 30+ goals.'

6093~~~
After next season? He shouldn't be an automatic starter now and shouldn't have been all season.

6094~~~
Aye, pretty shite today. Doesn't look fit, is he carrying a knock?

6095~~~
Honestly, I agreed with him getting 20+ goals until a few months ago up front. But he's had plenty of opportunity there, and even in our best form of the season performance wise he was fairly anonymous. 

System doesn't suit him and it's gonna be tough to find a striker who can the role Van Gaal wants well - but Rooney isn't the man for me.

6096~~~
He's been shocking for months.

If we go into next season with him as our main striker I fear for us.

6097~~~
As the captain he needs to lead by example.

Alas the team followed his example today in being completely half arsed.

Any sense of fire and passion appears to have disappeared from his game and that concerns me even more than his erratic control and passing.

6098~~~
Definitely now on the decline. He's only going to get worse from here.

6099~~~
Later guys I am just going to stay off this thread until next season starts. It is going to get ugly here. It always does in the summer.

6100~~~
I said it earlier in the season: when Rooney is on form he's on form, not matter where he plays.

This season he's just been pretty shit consistently and his worst attributes have been abundantly clear throughout (The odd game aside).

Unfortunately he'll be given all next season to regain his form as first choice regardless. Him and Valencia must have something in their contracts.

6101~~~
Does it suit any striker? They've all been shite. If Van Persie was embarrassing last week I'm not sure what this performance qualifies as.

6102~~~
Every year that he is our main man is going to be another year without trophies. When he got the new contract under Moyes I told my friends that I was wiling to wait 5 years before we start winning again. I waited 26 years so what is 5.
Use all the stats you want, I watch every game and Rooney has never been a highly skilled player and I never bought into the " white Pele " hype. I did not mind keeping him if his role was ancillary but if our game is going to revolve around him then it does not matter who we bring in, we simply wont win anything.
Somehow I believe LVG is going to do something about this.

6103~~~
He'll score a hat-trick or an important goal and we'll all go back to praising him.

6104~~~
He needs some real competition for his place, but he's too good to write off just yet.

6105~~~
He's dropping off but it's not as if we weren't warned.  I think when SAF brought van Persie in, it wasn't just because of Rooney's contract situation.  He also must've noticed in training and matches that Rooney was starting to lose the advantages that made him such a dangerous player - that his intensity was starting to diminish and he was losing that half-step ahead of defenders.  He is only 30, but seems much older than that.  We had signed Kagawa to play as the attacking midfielder but Rooney ended up in his place.

6106~~~
Yesterday, Chelsea had the league wrapped up whilst it was also clear United was going to be fourth. Before today's meaningless fixtures I think it looked like this:

Rooney (12), Van Persie (10), Falcao (4) scored 26 Premier League goals combined ---> Manchester United finishes 4th.

Costa (19), Remy (5), Drogba (4) score 28 Premier League goals combined ---> Chelsea finishes 1st

Now of course Remy and Costa have scored today, but there's still not a big difference in goals between their strikers and our strikers. You could say some of Rooney's goals have come from midfield and discount them. But to me the numbers mainly show that our strikers haven't really been the problem this season. Of course they could've done better in some matches, but for me they're not really to blame. I'd say it's the rest of the team who needs EDIT: to raise /EDIT their level if we want to compete for the league next year.

6107~~~
I agree. While I don't condone Rooney's performance today, I do think we lack the ability to open up teams, at times. I mean, today we were happy with just passing it from side to side, without any real penetration through the middle. 

I think next season Van Gaal needs to look at ways we can get our strikers involved in the game a lot more and how we can create more goalscoring opportunities.

6108~~~
Another leaden-footed display. Poor touch, wayward passing, one-paced and little-to-no goal threat. He needs a top striker pushing him because, best case scenario, he's become very complacent. Worse case, this is his terminal decline. We can't afford to assume he'll come good or we'll be lumbered with more of the same next year. A top striker is almost as important as a top centre back this summer.

6109~~~
Not sure he can keep his best level up anymore. He's not been on top form for too long and even though we are not creating much, he constantly loses the ball and is never involved.

6110~~~
Many still look at Rooney and rate him in the same way they used to rate him 6 years ago, he's lost many aspects of his game which made him really dangerous. He hasn't aged well at all. He has 5 top games each season but the rest he's either bang on average or even a liability when he has a really bad game like today. 3 seasons back he used to have these bad games but he would still grab a goal every now and then. He's even lost that. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

I think we need a striker that can be dangerous when running with the ball and keeps defenders on edge. A young Rooney. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6111~~~
I think it's time for Wayne to part ways with the club personally. He's a great career with us. He's won a shed load of trophies. I have been critical of him in the past, and that's just because I don't see 'it'. And by 'it' I mean what everyone on this thread seems to see, or promises we will see.

There will be shortage of suitors, and he can get one last handsome contract, (probably not 300k...), but yea - I think he's peaked and we're seeing his decline. I'm happy to be wrong about this, but his performances aren't conducive to the team.

He's still a good player, but I don't think he's right for the team going forward.

6112~~~
He has lost so much pace over the years. That play in the corner vs the McShane is a good case in point. Rooney has the ball and cuts back with the outside of his foot towards the touchline, his touch his a bit heavy, and the defender beats him to the ball fairly easily. Afterwards he really should have been booked for the petulant kick-out.

Unless RvP has one last season in him I don't see how we compete without buying a top-notch striker for next season.

6113~~~
Terrible overreaction as usual in this thread. I hate this place sometimes.

6114~~~
how?

6115~~~
Difficult to judge him on this seasons performance. Doing a job in various midfield positions for the team. Still top scorer at the club.

6/10

6116~~~
A decent season overall, although not spectacular. He generally looked better when played up front, mainly because we didn't really have anyone else who was decent at putting the ball in the net, or looking at all dangerous up front. His performances in midfield were often quite mixed.

6117~~~
Can't blame Rooney when we don't ever create anything for the most part. All of our strikers have struggled because of lack of Chances. Obviously Rooney needs to take some responsibility for that as well as everyone else.

6118~~~
I don't think he's good enough to be our number one striker anymore.

6119~~~
Agreed. And we're gonna have a problem if he doesn't step it up next season. LVG needs to realise that Rooney needs competition - it will get him fired up. Call it reverse psychology or what but he always fights harder if he feels threatened. This 'undroppable' stance by LVG is no good for Rooney. How he hasn't noticed that or someone hasn't pointed it out to LVG is beyond my comprehension. Rooney's just not consistent enough nowadays, and to start with him as our focal point next season will be a big mistake.

6120~~~
Yep. His flicks, touches, dribbles just don't come off anymore and he rarely looks dangerous for the opposition. Rooney is capable of the one off performance still (against spurs for example), but like you say he is just not consistent enough at all. Making him captain was a huge mistake IMO.

6121~~~
Yeah this is true, but there's nothing to stop LVG from taking it back off him. It would probably benefit him in the long run. Don't get me wrong, I think he's handled it all right, but unfortunately it seems to hold him back in some ways....
We need an intense bastard as captain to be honest, someone who can inspire not for only a few select games but for the duration of the season. Unfortunately, not sure we have anyone else at the moment...

6122~~~
I hope he's one do two main strikers next season, with the other one being a new singing. Depending entirely on him as the main striker doesn't make sense right now. He's too far behind the top strikers.

6123~~~
<a class="username" data-user="61387, @kid777" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/61387/">@kid777</a> there's no overreaction, we are 2 years beind Sir Alex in wanting him gone.

The time to sell is now, before his decline becomes obvious to all. If we can find a taker.

6124~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6125~~~
If he's the best striker we've got come September 1st, we're in trouble next season.

6126~~~
I am puzzled about his best position these days. It feels like a catch-22 situation, there are better numbers 9s out there, same goes for 10s.

6127~~~
Problem is that he is more or less undroppable. Even if we get in a better striker than him, we will still play Rooney. No idea where but he'll play when fit, no matter how wank his form is.

6128~~~
LVG is the one manager that I think is strong enough to make the right decision concerning Rooney. Rooney is still King in most supporters' minds but LVG must know that for us to be successful Rooney's role must be diminished. He will do what he needs to do for us to be champions, his ego will not succumb to fans wishes.

6129~~~
He has 14 goals to his name despite playing in midfield a lot. He's not the player he once used to be, but can always get you a goal. I don't see the reason for all the negativity regarding Rooney. If you want to talk about a steep decline, look at Falcao and now even van Persie.

6130~~~
No one helped him and made any proper movement. Not saying he played well though, he was trash.

6131~~~
Ive saying he's a massive problem going forward last season and throughout this.

It is ridiculous Moyes got to give him that contract. Ferguson would of sold him, and rightfully so. Rooneys best days are long past him.

We have to hope he can adapt to a midfield role, because he isn't the answer as a #9 anymore, and him being captain thus playing when fit is a problem unless he can adapt to midfield.

6132~~~
If we sign the right players behind him. I think he'll have a good 15-16 season. He's a great finisher and a better creative mind than most number 9s.

6133~~~
When he signed that contract last year, I'd mentally prepared myself for a few more years of seeing him put in below par performances with a few high points sprinkled in between. No surprises here. Still a good player but one on a wane.

6134~~~
He seems to be happy with the current situation so there's no need for him to initiate a move and I can't see LVG binning his captain anytime soon. Also selling him won't be an easy task as the clubs who can meet his wage demands arguably have better strikers in their first team, buying Rooney and making him the second / backup option would be a rather expensive move. He might prove some of us wrong and bag 20+ goals but the chances of him doing that until 2018 are slim.

6135~~~
His season has tailed off badly. Very poor again yesterday and offered little.

6136~~~
Creative mind is fine but you still have to retain the ball, hold it up and not mess up your touch, to be able to use your creative thoughts.

I agree that he'll have a good season if the team is better next season. But I still feel we have to have proper alternative that is more dynamic and explosive while not having Rooney's maturity infront of goal.

6137~~~
I don't know what happens, but pretty much every season he is very poor after the new year. Last time I remember him having a good second part of the season was 2011 and then he basically missed almost all of the first part with his shit. Our very own Fabregas.

6138~~~
Rooney will get you goals. His calmness infront of goal ensures that. So if anyone thinks he is finished they're overreacting for sure.

However, does that automatically mean him alone being relied on is enough for us to win the premier league next season and challenge for big honors consistently? I dont think so.

Finishing aside, his all around game has steeply declined, as has his explosiveness. If you look at the other teams and the guys they have upfront - Costa and Aguero and before this season Suarez at Liverpool - Rooney is far below them. His game is passive in nature and his all around game usually just about does enough or really clearly doesn't. Even his physical presence simply isn't there anymore. Rarely does he bully defenders with his physical attributes or frighten them with his skill. But he does give you mental strength, calmness infront of goal and now, a bit of leadership.

I think getting a top striker would fantastic. But given that's usually not easy, we need to invest in someone with proper explosiveness upfront, someone who can turn centre backs and put fright in them, who isn't necessarily fully developed and matured and hence not a top striker. But hopefully we can take him there in a year or two's time.

6139~~~
Also, I want to focus on Rooney's physical presence. Why is it now so poor? As a young player he used be known for his "power" play. Now, he seems a bit feeble really, and defenders are able to dispossess him far too easily. He doesn't win nearly enough "battles" for me and that's essential for a number 9.

In his last top top season as a centre forward when he got 30 goals and his injury hurt us towards the fag end, I remember that he used to hold the ball up excellently and really play physically like a centre forward should.

I don't want this to be seen as an inane bashing of Rooney but does anyone else feel he could do more in this sense? Or has his physical characteristics and him as a football just changed now.

6140~~~
I am probably in the minority on here but I think it's time to consider letting Rooney go, the reason being that since being made captain he plays regardless of form or formation, just where is his best position ?
Number 9 ?( no chance while we play a lone striker), Number 10 ? (Not for me unless we get the ball forward quicker) midfield ? ( not disciplined enough).
I think he has lost his spark, even become complacent ? Maybe its time for a new challenge.

6141~~~
Fully agree with this.

6142~~~
Love Rooney.
Great all round game

Part of me thinks he's holding us back <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6143~~~
me too tbh.

6144~~~
Rooney was our best outfield player this year! Again! 

He will definitely be the most important part of our forward line next year. And the captain of our squad. 

I hope that he will score enough goals to become our best ever striker!

6145~~~
I hope that people are starting to see what I have seen for a long time - that is is (and has been for some time) in decline. He has far more mediocre games than great ones these days. Nowhere near strikers like Aguero or Suarez that are needed to even challenge Chelsea.

SAF had obviously seen it 2 years ago.

6146~~~
Like I said above, I think his all round game is very good, I just don't think he really excels at anything.

He doesn't always seem to have the positional disipline to play as a lone striker (Muller)
He doesn't have the speed to cause problems (Aguero)
He doesn't have the technique to dribble passed players (Suarez)
He doesn't have the height to cause problems in the air (Crouch <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>) (especially with all our crosses late on in this season)

He can do a bit of everything, he just doesn't seem to really have a stand out skill. Well, his long range passing is exceptional

6147~~~
Rooney's finishing is not the problem, the problem is relying on Rooney to both create and finish. Start creating chances and he'll score.

6148~~~
He's been great for us over a long time, and he's scored some vital goals. His contribution and effort cannot be understated, but I really would not mind him being sold this summer. He would be a great squad-player, but I just cannot shake the feeling that we need better players in any of the positions he can fill. I highly doubt that he wants to stay on as a rotation option though, but he's honestly not good enough to be starting for us, neither as a #9, nor a #10 or any other position.

6149~~~
Not sure why any of you are wasting your time saying he should be sold

It is not going to happen.

6150~~~
I totally agree with all of this.

6151~~~
Indeed.  He's captain,  he's undroppable. 

As others have said though,  the main problem with rooney this season has been the good awful service. 

A good example of how important that is can be seen with Chelsea.  Costa isn't brilliant, he's probably about the same level as rooney can be when he's arsed enough.  Is the standard of service he's received at Chelsea which has been exceptional

6152~~~
Costa is a lot better than Rooney.

6153~~~
Yeah, I’m not really getting why people want him to be sold. He wasn’t magnificent this season by any means, but he was still one of our better outfield players, and managed to finish as our top scorer despite sometimes being lumped into midfield. Unless we strengthen there in the summer, he’s going to be the best forward we have available. Definitely not someone we should sell at the moment.

6154~~~
He definitely is, and I’d say the same for Aguero obviously. I do think that Rooney’s not been at his very best for a few years now, but he’s probably still the best option we have available up front.

6155~~~
He is, which is why we should consider getting a new signing, someone on the up.

6156~~~
Don't know how you can say Costa isn't brilliant. When he's actually fully fit he's easily one of the 3-4 best strikers in the world.

6157~~~
Yeah, I’d say we should be looking to sign a new striker. The only problem may be as to whether it’s a priority area – we need a new GK if De Gea goes, and a new CB, as well as a new right-back potentially. We’re probably going to need at least one of a central midfielder or winger, so if LVG sees them as more important, we may not add any strikers.

And even if we did add one, I don’t think it’s Rooney who should be sacrificed and sold. He arguably offers us more in overall play than RVP does, and obviously Falcao is likely to be heading out.

6158~~~
Definitely. He was actually the possibly best player in la liga during 13-14, and he's been great in the premier league but hampered by injuries.

6159~~~
It's probably not an area we can afford to spend big on given we have Rooney and need to make other signings, but I hope we let falcao and Rvp and pull off a shrewd buy. Like juve did with tevez, or a younger striker with not long to go before reaching top striker levels.

6160~~~
Ashley Young Ander Herrera and Chris Smalling all say hi.

6161~~~
layman would say we've got all these top class strikers looking at these names: Falcao, RVP, Rooney, all of them massively declined, all top teams and some midtable ones have better strikers than us. we should do something with it, I hope LVG has got balls to sell rooney to MLS or anywhere, even with his wages we would have 3+ great players.. 

The biggest BS people say here that he needs service, he's not getting the best one but we are surely not that bad and he needs to do better up front to get to those chances.. I don't say welbz was better, he wasn't good finisher but he could operate in tight spaces could over sprint anyone, actually press the defense and goalkeeper. I think even his hold up and link up play was better.

Rooney's so slow it's unbelievable, last game he was chasing the ball and I thought myself "Is he going straight from pub"? he can't control the ball well and his wonder skills he shows from time to time and quite creative thinking are too inconsistent and doesn't make up for his terrible movement and touch.

When you look at Costa, Suarez, Aguero, Kane... they do so much more than finish, the days of pure no9 strikers are all gone, we shouldn't settle for that rooney is only going to finish chances.. sell him before we can get some cash for him

6162~~~
This is correct. 

When you look at players Like Shaw, Blind, Rojo (LB); Young, Mata, Fellaini, Herrera (CM/AM) and Valencia (RB) i.e. the most prominently featuring players over the last 10-15 games, its truly not hard to understand why our strikers performed so poorly this year. The above mentioned players let us down, to some extent, with regards to their creativity; they quite simply do not create enough which is why we scored only 62 goals this year. It's also not helped that our most creative player was left to rot on the bench for two months or so, and the fact that we seem the only be able to play cohesive football whist Carrick is on the pitch. 

Right now, I don't believe that RvP, Falcao and Rooney turned into terrible strikers in the space of a season. We clearly turned into a terrible team within two.

6163~~~
Where is this notion that he is creative coming from? When he gets the ball he either tries to turn back, sprays it to the right wing or shoots. That's if he gets it under control at all.

6164~~~
Leadership, finesse, doing things that others simply can't.

I agree he hasn't been brilliant in the last few games, but most of the season he has.

6165~~~
If he's been brilliant for the most of the season you must be seeing things I simply can't.
Finesse for instance, hasn't been a part of his game when I've watched him. He quite simply looks burnt out, his best attributes, power, stamina and pace seem mostly gone, and frankly he hasn't added enough to his game to warrant an automatic selection. Over time he's improved his finishing but his overall game, leaves a lot to be desired when we aspire to win the league.

It reminds me of the emperor's new clothes when people are defending him. The argument is mostly: If you know anything about football you see how good he is. There isn't any actual things to notice about him but it's there.If you can't see it, you are clueless<i>.</i> Those of us who constantly see him miscontrol a pass, slow down attacks with his uninspiring passing, or struggling to outpace even the most lumbering centre half, are just missing the bigger picture.

He was one of my favorite players, I've long let go of the transfer request thing, he just isn't delivering anymore. Played one up top he'll probably keep up fine goalscoring stats, but the way I see it we need more pace, more running behind, and quicker passing in this position. He (or our other forwards) don't worrydefences anymore, they can push up higher and that leads to our constant sideways passing.
That brings us to the question who can we sign to challenge him, maybe Lacazette but it's slim pickins this summer it seems.

6166~~~
I don't think there's that many 9s out there that are better than Rooney that we could sign. Are Lacazette and Kane the best young strikers who could still move to a better club?

I just think the gap between Rooney and the other 9s at the top clubs is far less than the gap between Valencia and their RBs, Jones/Rojo and their LCBs, Valdes and their keepers, Fellaini and their LCMs and Young and their LWFs. 

Benzema and Lewandowski are younger and more mobile and are more reliable holding up the ball, but they typically have the 25-30 goals in about 45-50 games I think we'd from Rooney playing alone up top.

So, at highest, I'd say replacing Rooney should be 6th or 7th priority. And presumably we don't want a truly insane amount of turnover and with strikers being so expensive, I'd probably shelve this issue until next summer at the earliest.

6167~~~
I think this is exactly what will happen and for the reasons you have stated. Replacing him simply isn't as high a priority as fixing our problem positions, if we did that and neglected those positions then we will remain where we are and if we tried to replace him and fix our problems we are inviting problems caused by too much turnover of the playing staff.
I'd say make the team solid and get it playing cohesively whilst Rooney and RVP slug it out for the starter role and then replace both in 2016!

6168~~~
Well yesterday he received a nice pass just outside the area and had about 7 yards of space in front of him. What did our dangerous striker do? He took one dribble forward and then decided to cut back away from goal to safety. Oh yeah, and he lost the ball because he wasn't aware enough to know there was a defender closing him down in that direction. I can't think of many good strikers taking that choice in that situation.

As I see it Rooney does this because he knows he really can't take on defenders with much success anymore. Most often he is stripped of the ball pretty easily and is embarassed. I really think he is not bold anymore because he will be found out. Is this the kind of striker that could lead us to a EPL title?

6169~~~
Has he added weight?

6170~~~
The hell? Don't tell me that's a new style. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6171~~~
The waistcoat is dreadful.

6172~~~
He has been average at best.

6173~~~
Taking the piss now. Not only has he lost the ability to score goals, now he cant even dress properly.

6174~~~

6175~~~
Would be quite astonishing how quick it happened this year.

6176~~~
It's one of the great myths here. People will probably dump assist statistics in your face to justify it while completely ignoring what actually goes on when he plays.

6177~~~
For a 9, he's reasonably creative in that he isn't selfish, has a good range of passing, isn't static (though Van Gaal likes a more static striker) and can combine in short spaces on the deck. 

But yeah, he hasn't created a ton of attacks with his back to goal since we were beating Arsenal on the break with Park and others rushing past him. 

I think people are overrating strikers in general here. The best teams have brilliant wide attackers and very good strikers these days, not so much the other way around.

6178~~~
Awesome username btw <a class="username" data-user="94362, @Art Vandelay" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94362/">@Art Vandelay</a>

6179~~~
I remember when I used to read that Mata doesn't play well on away games. Captain Fantastic hey.

6180~~~
Bloody hell, that's worrying.

6181~~~
Brilliant may be a bit strong, but he hasn't just been average. We're still a better team with him on the pitch that we are without, in my opinion.

I'd have no issue if we brought in a younger, fresher striker to play instead of Rooney, but I think he still deserves a place in our team.

6182~~~
He's just the sort of bloke that forgets to button his trousers. Scouser.

6183~~~
Not only will some use statistics to justify their opinion of his greatness but he is often attributed with these intangibles (above ). Sometimes I wonder if there is a different Rooney out there other than the one I am seeing.
Once he is on the field ultimately a lot of our play will go through him. If he is up top then we will lose out on neat sharp interplay around the box, if he is in the midfield its going to be a lot of side and back passes with switches over to the Right wing for him to delay his entry into the box to hopefully meet a cross.
Who are we going to beat with that style of football?
Right now I think his supporters are worried he wont break Utd's goalscoring record and would like him to break Shearer's prem record as a Red. I understand their concern, he is their hero, but at what cost should we acquiesce to their wishes? I am sorry but football success is about the here and now and not sentiments we need to give ourselves the best chance of winning every year because you never know when a drought may arise, 1967-1993.

6184~~~
He's been fecking poor this season in all but a handful of games, which just happens to be a handful more than any of our other strikers.

Best of several bad options, we wont win the title with him as our main striker.

6185~~~
Get rid.

6186~~~
Cheers. It was either this or Dr. Mantis Toboggan.

As much as I'd love to see us get rid of Rooney, that stat might be a bit unfair as we have been fairly crap away from home in general in that time. I'm not defending him at all, I think we were absolute mugs not to get rid of him when we had the chance. I just think that stat isn't the thing he should be bashed for.

Interesting insight into LVG's penalty taker philosophy in that interview.  Like Neville says, you'd think it'd just add more pressure, or I guess maybe if a player wants to stay #1 he'll practice so much that missing becomes less and less likely.

6189~~~

6190~~~
I don't think Rooney is good enough to justify his weekly wage any more but who to bring in that would be guaranteed better is a hard question to answer.

6191~~~
Perfectly put.

6192~~~
He's not been good enough for his weekly wage since he first kicked off and got a mega deal way back when but we're not the ones paying it I guess.

I do believe it'll forever be looked on as a mistake to give him the 5 year contract that we did, but then last year was so full of mistakes it'll get lost in the malaise.

He's a problem. As others have said he has a series of things that he's good at, but none that he's great at and they're only getting worse but because he's undroppable he'll forever cause the problem.

Better than our other strikers though.

6193~~~
His season for me has been mixed, playing CM to a decent level but often holding filling in for us wouldnt have helped. For me last yr under Moyes he looked really good. He then got a run up top and looked sharp again. He then dwindled off towards the end and looked isolated and wasteful. 

I dont think this style suits him. 

When he played no10 under Fergie and scored his most goals, we were quick on the counter Valencia crosses for him to head, shots from distance that he could poach etc, there was space around the box. Now its awful for a striker, we get the ball to the edge of the area in just enough time for all 10 of their players to come back and find positions, some would argue this is where a RVN or a true no10 makes their money. But we have just been flinging in a lot of hopefull balls etc or losing possession with poor passing.

I think Wayne will be fine next yr with more stability and no reliance on him in CM, with Herrera, Carrick and Blind available plus maybe a signing. BUT he is going to be 30 and thus some say prime some say starting to lose a bit. We will see. He's passionate about getting us back to where we need to be, I think no10 under LVG requires a lot of understanding of what he wants though, as there clearly is not a lot of freedom of expression on the field in the current tactics.

6194~~~
I agree. It's easy to forget what Rooney's strengths are when watching him in the current system.

He is a world class counter attacking player. His decision making on the break, and ability make runs into the box at the right time is second only to Ronaldo.  I can easily see why Mourinho would want to work with him, they'd be perfect for each other. What he is not particularly good at, is finding an opening in a tight defense... which is what we've had to face almost every single game this season.

I don't think he's likely to get us +25 a season goals under LvG, but if our wingers start chipping in with goals, I'm sure he'll be very useful for years to come.

6195~~~
Although I have said above that I hope we sign a new striker, I do expect Rooney to have a good season in 15-16.

6196~~~
His recording scoring away isn't too good but as a club - especially this season we've been poor. I think it's systematic of that. It would be worse if we had played GREAT and hadn't been scoring but away this season, we've not got going. Against Hull, I thought he did well at times and other times sloppy. He had a great effort that his the bar so with a more dynamic confident team, we'll see a better Rooney. Especially if LVG is telling him to stay up top. You still need good tempo and good service though from other people and that's hopefully what we improve on

6197~~~
He has been average for the last three seasons and that is a fact. We aren't going to win anything with him as our number 9

6198~~~
When he played as a striker during our best form as a team his performances weren't great, Spurs aside. Villa, Liverpool and City particularly he was largely anonymous. As a CF I wouldn't say he's been clearly better than van Persie and we'd still get good money for him whereas RVP would be sold for no more than £12-15 million at most.

6199~~~
Problem is what do you want to do with him. Sell him? Bench him as captain and 200k a week?

6200~~~
That is an astonishing stat. I don't think he's good enough anymore to be a nailed-on starter for us. That doesn't mean he should be sent packing - he's still a good player, but for a club of our ambition, we need a striker playing at a higher level than what Rooney has for the last year or so.

6201~~~
I don't think he needs to remain captain. He didn't exactly invoke memories of Roy Keane out there. I'd strip him of the captaincy (give it to someone like Herrera or even Smalling,) and make him fight for a spot as a striker (none of this moving him back into midfield nonsense.)

6202~~~
Didn't he score against Arsenal at the Emirates in the Autumn, in the league?

6203~~~
That's the "one" goal he mentioned in his tweet.

6204~~~
Just realised he contracted till 2019 on that wage, wow, he'll be 34 then... do we really think hes going to have a another 4 years at the very top level?

6205~~~
No.

6206~~~
I touched upon this in another thread, and I really think we have a real problem on our hands here. He might be fine for another season but I can't see anything else happening other then that his decline will continue. 
For my money, Ferguson saw this coming (which is why he dropped Rooney for the Madrid tie) and tried to make it easy for Moyes to get rid - however, Moyes took it upon himself to revive Rooney (which he to be fair, managed to do to a <i>certain </i>extent but not enough to justify it imo) and gave him a big fat long term contract which we are now stuck with.

6207~~~
we have been pretty poor away from home all season in fairness.
something like 21 away league goals only?

would be interesting to see how many of the 19 games Rooney actually played as a striker for 90mins in

6208~~~
Ah yeah sorry, read the tweet too quickly!

6209~~~
If we sign a top class striker in the summer and one or two more quality midfielders, well then where exactly does that leave Rooney? I'm not saying he's a bad player, he's still brilliant when on his game, but his competition this season was a declined RVP, a next to useless Falcao and Wilson, a youngster. I'd imagine that will change big time next season.

6210~~~
I’m not sure. I used to think he’d eventually drop back into a midfield role permanently and perform fairly well in around 2011 when he was performing superbly as a second striker, but I doubt that’ll happen now.

He’ll hopefully still have a couple of good years in him though, and may remain a useful squad player even if he’s past his very best.

6211~~~
I remember thinking we'd have been better off selling Rooney when Moyes took over. Events after that proved me wrong though as RVP's form dipped along with that of the team in general and suddenly Rooney seemed an essential player again. His attitude and the way he embraced the captaincy has also impressed, I think.

Problem is, if we keep improving then we will eventually return to a point where we have better players in the positions he plays, which will make it difficult to justify starting him. We already have a better #10 in Mata imo and if we were to sign a top quality striker then Rooney wouldn't deserve to start as a #9 either (in much the same way RVP took the role when he arrived). Add in however other many signings and what happens to Rooney?

Not a problem right now but it could become one very quickly.

6212~~~
Rooney's been better as a 10 than Mata for us. 4 starts, 4 goals and 1 assist this season. Mata didn't play better when Rooney served his 3 match ban.

6213~~~
How do you solve a problem like Wayne Rooney. Hell of a problem to have though. I still believe he can be a 20 goal + a season number 9, but the problem we have is putting all our eggs in one basket as falcao is gone, hernandez isnt good enough and rvp seems long past it. so bringing in a young player as backup could be incredibly risky considering last year we just couldn't score any goals.

Whatever team we put out currently, is improved by Waynes presence, but oddly enough he isn't the best player we have in any one position and considering we could really do with a benzema/lewandowski muller level striker in the side, where do we put him? By reverting him back to a no.10 im not sure we have the midfielders to play effectively in a 2 man midfield, you would need somebody a bit sturdier than hererra to partner carrick in a 2, and hererra is too good a player to bench.

Maybe im overthinking things.

6214~~~
Still think Mata is the better player now though. He's younger and he's previously reached a higher level at #10 than what we've seen from him so far. 

If we're talking about including only one of them as permanent fixture in the first team for the foreseeable future then it should be Mata every time imo.

6215~~~
Give it a rest you lot. There are many bigger problems in our squad than Wayne Rooney.

6216~~~
Is Rooney good enough realistically to be our main striker in the formation we play? Does he score enough? If we wanted to mount a realistic title challenge next year, could we do it with Rooney as the main man?

6217~~~
His natural goal-scoring abilities alone would guarantee 15-20 goals in a season but IMO he looks to be slowing down.  I mean, he may be one of our quicker players up front but as a team overall we're slow.  LVG also seems to want a high-possession striker who can hold up the play and service other players moving forward, which is why van Persie played so much early on in the season even when he wasn't scoring.  Rooney's touch and ball retention abilities are bad these days, even Welbeck would've been better at it if we kept him.

6218~~~
He's the sort of striker like Benzema and Lewandowski, who can keep the centre backs occupied and who can provide assists or create chances for players like Memphis and Bale. If we use him like that, he's a very good fit, but I don't think he'll be the goal-scoaring machine he was in 09/10 and 11/12 again.

6219~~~
When was the last time he made a Ronaldo-esque run into the box? I can remember him doing this when Ronaldo was playing next to him, which is 5 years or so ago.

6220~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7FfOO1N8vQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

6221~~~
Right now, yes.

All we have to do is sign a striker who is currently better than Rooney though (Benzema, for example) and suddenly there's an argument that Rooney shouldn't get in the starting eleven. Given he's our captain and is on massive money that then becomes a fair problem.

6222~~~
This "problem" exists only in your mind! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6223~~~
He did it plenty after Ronaldo left too. His second goal at the Etihad game (2-3, RVP's injury time goal) comes to mind.

The way we played under Moyes and now LvG doesn't set him up in those positions at all.

6224~~~
Would like to see Rooney spear head a counter attacking system but most likely won't happen at United. Perhaps for England.

Rooney has also shown to be excellent as lone striker in a wing based attack.

He has shown this season to be average in a possession setup and RVP and Falcao looked even worse.

Will be interesting to see how LVG lines up next season with a summer to bring in more quality.

6225~~~
A lot of people saying they doubt his ability to get goals prolifically, yet he's scored 14 in 37 this season - a pretty good total if you consider he spent a hell of a lot of time in midfield. On top of that, when he's played up front, it's hardly been as part of a swashbuckling, attacking team. With additional games next season, a more fixed position in the side and the team generally performing better as an attacking unit, I see no reason why he can't get 20+ goals.

Rooney is one of the few hardened leaders and winners in our squad - we should think carefully before jettisoning that. The issue is more how we can keep Rooney in a position on the pitch where he's going to get goalscoring chances on a regular basis and the key is to ensure the other areas of the pitch are manned properly, so he doesn't need to be shunted around. Not to mention the fact that we need to inject the team with a couple of pacier players.

We scored 62 this season - Chelsea won the league with 73 goals, but they had a pretty good defence. If we say you need to score 75 goals to be in contention, we're looking for another 13. I don't see that burden falling on one player. I reckon Depay could make up a good chunk of that. What I do like about our squad is the ability to spread the goals around - Herrera, Mata and Fellaini (urgh) should all be looking to get near 10 goals, for instance.

6226~~~
Lots of sense here in a thread full of garbage for the most part.

6227~~~
The first paragraph is true for both Rooney and RVP though. The latter of which people have been lamented as totally finished all season. RVP has 10 goals in 27, whereas Rooney has 12 goals in 33. Rooney has played deeper more frequently, but RVP played far more at the start of the season when the whole team was diabolical and the system was a shambles. It'd actually be interesting to see Rooney's scoring stats in different positions, as this season in my mind he's seemed to score a similar amount from midfield, number 10 and striker (although that could be hugely inaccurate).

However I agree with a poster above that Rooney or the centre forward position in general isn't something we should be focusing on at the moment (unless Benzema becomes available). If we're creative enough Rooney and RVP will score 20+ goals next season if they get a full season. Also as you say Depay, Herrera, Mata, Di Maria & Fellaini should get another 30.

It's a somewhat pointless discussion anyway. Rooney will play every game he's fit for the next 2 seasons, pretty much regardless. He's Van Gaal's captain and our highest paid player with 4 years left on his contract. We have 4 options: him playing constantly in midfield, constantly as a number 10, constantly up front or a mixture of all 3. He isn't awful in any of these positions, but he isn't great in any of these positions.

6228~~~
Rooney hasnt spent that much time in midfield, it's getting really overplayed atm. He's scored 4 in 14 matches as a striker, and also has played as no 10. for big parts of tbe season. He's been the main striker since Rvp got injured, and he's scored like 2/3 goals in that period?

6229~~~
How so? I'm saying *if* we sign better players than Rooney in the positions he plays then his starting role comes under doubt. Given that we are being linked to (or already have) players in exactly those positions then it's hardly insane to wonder if/when that scenario might come to pass.

6230~~~
<b>Wayne Rooney has scored 1 away goal in the Premier League since March 2014. </b>[Football365]

6231~~~
Focusing solely in goals is not enough. Rvp scored 10 in 25. 

Not that I agree with selling him.

6232~~~
Unfortunately, one time a year doesn't make his performance next to Ronaldo. It is strange that he does well before Christmas and then falls off every year.

6233~~~
According to whoscored, he's played 14 games as a central midfielder, 4 games as an attacking midfielder and 14 games as a forward with one game as a forward on the left.  It looks like they are just breaking down his league games.

That's plenty of games as a midfielder.

6234~~~
My stance is that we should avoid doing a big overhaul of the squad. However if we do want to make a large number of changes then I would definitely support a 'changing of the guard' as far as Rooney is concerned. I dont feel that the club owes him any enormous measure of loyalty after his contract shenanigans - and I just dont think he is good enough to be the main striker for an elite club any more.

6235~~~
Its hilarious how he's seen as some big issue when we have a team riddled with much bigger ones than him.

6236~~~
I wish we could have Aguero or Suarez in our team just to see if it really is the strikers or the rest of the team. 

I have a feeling watching those 2 that they would create/score goals in any team in the world, where as with Rooney I don't feel that anymore like I used too.

6237~~~
That's exactly how I feel. I don't think he's got the physical attributes nor the intelligence to create space for himself anymore.

He's also lost the ability to turn his marker and make that extra yard to get a shot away in a split second like all top strikers do.

6238~~~
Yep. People say "but he needs service", he never needed service when he was younger, he could beat players and make room by moving the defence around. It's not his fault but his body is catching up with him and just can't run like he used too. Yes if the team is build around him and used as a poacher he will still score, but in this team we need more than a poacher.

6239~~~
I don't think we could lose Rooney even if we wanted too. He earns a huge amount of money. No other club can or will pay him the same amount of money.

6240~~~
Not worried about him tbh. A good rest this summer, then start him as a lone striker from day one of next season. We will definitely need cover if RVP is finished (I still think there's a good chance he can be a useful option but we'll see) because Rooney does pick up knocks and seems to take noticeably longer to recover from them than most players, which is the main area of concern. His ability is not in question for me.

6241~~~
I honestly think that Rooney is going to be a major problem next year. He isn't good enough to play in midfield at the top level, too often tries Hollywood passes rather than doing the simple thing, doesn't move the ball around quickly enough and is too one-footed (predictable). As a striker, I just can't see him playing the role that van Gaal expects from his centre forward. It will mainly be a season of playing with his back to goal acting to occupy the centre halves. He was praised for the way in which he did this against City but since then it hasn't happened.

I have always felt that once his pace and strength starts to go he will only be a good player, as opposed to a brilliant one. As he is captain I really cant see him being dropped but I can't see where he is going to fit in if we can bring a top striker in

6242~~~
It's hilarious how people ignore his decline too.

6243~~~
He's a huge issue because he plays in such a vital role and secondly because he is made captain, it is a big obstacle which gets in the way removing him from the starting XI. Everyone is easy to get rid off, he isn't.

Does anyone think there's a flipside to his versatility that is never pointed out? He can play across the front line and in midfield but in every one of those positions, he's <i>never</i> found the perfect partner or the perfect set of complementary players. He had flashes of form with van Nistelrooy, Saha, Tevez, Berbatov, Hernández, Welbeck and van Persie but none of them were genuinely great partnerships. We still have no idea who even complements him in midfield and over the years we've tried everyone from Michael Carrick to Rio bloody Ferdinand, and he's never really looked comfortable no matter what the setup was. Out wide he's always been nothing more than a stop gap. Some people say he had a great partnership with Ronaldo as evidenced by some great counter-attacking goals, but then others point to 07/08 being perhaps Rooney's worst ever season with us on an individual level in large part because he was sacrificed to accommodate Ronaldo.

He definitely can play a number of positions to a relatively high level from an individual perspective but most of the time it comes at the expense of other players. It's an odd thing to say about someone so selfless and versatile but I've thought for a while now that he's been one of the main players that restricts us. He's never had a fixed position nailed down that we could then build the team around. The major factor him being moved around a lot is his inconsistent form, not his versatility, IMO. If he played like he did in 09/10 on a consistent basis then the team would be moved around to accommodate him, not the other way around.

He's been a mainstay in our team for a decade now and still we don't really know who we should be buying to play alongside him to get the best out of him individually or where we should be playing him to get the best out of the team. That's quite a big problem that is never really discussed on here.

6245~~~
I'd love to pair him up with a forward up front. He's a good #9, but I think as time goes on the best way to get the most out of him is to play him up front with someone.

6246~~~
Well, I think the majority would probably agree his best role is playing at the speartip of a 433 or 4231 (no.9), failing that as a no.10 playing off another forward, and failing that left side or central mdifeld, in that order.

He's had a very, very mediocre end of season run in, not just in terms of goals but performances, which has reignited the <i>Rooney issue</i> I guess, for the fact he seems the first name on the team sheet, captain, undropable etc he's not been spectacular in any given role.
I mean that in the sense we could probably find better players this summer for each specific role... as no.9, no.10, no.8 on the market, for much, much less contractually than Rooney is paid.
Is he good enough to play no.9 reguarly for us next year?, yea... because we have so many other issues with the team that need solving first.

I just can't shake the continual feeling of disappointment with Rooney, it's alarming how long this has been carrying on in one form or another.

6247~~~
Our other issues can be largely resolved if we spend big money, whereas any problems with Rooney could be made worse by doing the same thing. And we *are* going to spend a lot of money, so...

6248~~~
Like a really, really, really high quality John O'Shea....

It is definitely telling that even after all these years the caf would probably still be pretty split as to whether Rooney is best used as a #9 or a #10. That sort of versatility makes it quite hard for us to plan ahead as we could conceivably bring in a better player than him in either position, yet his status is such that strengthening too much would cause its own problems. So the temptation then is to keep moving him from role to role as needed....

6249~~~
It has been pointed out a lot last season and season before that when he was paired with van Persie that he only works with quick strikers who can stretch defenses like Welbeck and Chicharito, hence his best form in last 4 or 5 years was during the time when he was paired with them.

The problem was of course that he was always inconsistent but we could put up even with that if we had someone more quality than Hernandez, but Hernandez simply wasn't quality enough to play in our first XI and Welbeck's problem was always lack of goals, and he never really got the time up front with van Persie's arrival after his good breakthrough season. I think he works well with pacey striker ahead of him but then the team also has to have quality wide players because Rooney's creativity isn't all that and as a somekind of number 10 he should be more creative. If I remember well, in one of his best seasons in last 4 or 5 years he had just 4 assists playing behind Welbeck/Hernandez, even Nani scored lot of goals that season but they were rarely assisted by Rooney.

As for him and his partners in midfield, it wasn't discussed because he never really showed that he can be quality midfielder, IMO. He always lacked few basic qualities (awareness, consistency, defensive nous) midfielders should have to be even discussed as a long term option in midfield.

Personally, my biggest problem with Rooney is that he was undroppable with pretty much every manager(altough, Fergie did know how to use him better than any other manager) which IMO is ridiculous because he is very inconsistent player whose bottom level is really low and I am not sure if there was single season where he didn't show that level for at least month or two. Also, his highest level very rarely happens so that's why I think he definitely isn't the player we should be building the team around.

6250~~~
Rooney's international career is comical to me. 
Name even one top class memorable performance from him for England since his goals at Euro 04 

At WC 06 he got sent off for stamping, he failed to help England even qualify for Euro 08, at WC 10 his touch and passing was abysmal even at walking pace, couldn't tell you anything about euro 12 and in Brazil last year he did nothing of importance that I can recall - didn't England lose 2 out of 3 matches?

And yet, he's going to be their highest scorer of all time soon and will be celebrated as a great <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6251~~~
I believe it all comes down to what kind of football you want to play and how you plan to create chances in the final third. Rooney is undoubtedly an attacking player who can offer a lot of things in the attacking third and most managers love to have players like him at their disposal. What makes him important, at least in my eyes, is his constant off the ball movement and his ability to create pockets of space both for him and his teammates in between the opposition lines. Now, that's a skill you usually have to pay lots of money to acquire. Furthermore, he collects many second balls, creates numerical advantages in the final third, he can pass and shoot while running with the ball (an aspect of our game where we lack talent)  and can score goals in many different ways.

What he can't do is out-muscle CBs and try to get to the end of (blind) crosses or get past two or three defenders because the wide attacking players rarely touch the opposition box. That's why i believe that signing Depay, an inside forward who can score goals, is a move towards the right direction. That's the kind of players Rooney needs near him when he's playing as a forward. Add a b2b CM to our left side and a RB that can cross the ball to our right (to create spaces for Mata) and we'll have a very strong team whenever we are on the ball.

He's not the only player who struggled during our last two seasons. If that was a clear sign of his decline, then we should be considering to kick the 2/3 of our squad out of Carrington. LvG has indicated that he wants to build a team around a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3 formation with inverted wingers and i believe Rooney will have no problem to play as a forward in such a team. I also believe that next season we'll see less experiments from LvG with players being used in different positions.

But we're still a work in progress, it'll be fairer to judge Rooney (and all the others) when LvG finally completes rebuilding the team. By then we'll probably have a midfield who won't need half a day to get the ball forward too, so our attacking players will have something to work with. But if we are going to keep playing the ball wide and putting crosses in the box, yes we should look for a different type of forward.

6252~~~
I wish he'd do more of this to be honest. He's become mature and more reliable but also really quite feeble. Doesn't win many tussles, and defended nick the ball of his too easily.

6253~~~
I think that's mostly due to his first touch, he keeps the ball too far away from him when turning. Even his first touch is really bad at times, it almost looks like a pass. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> When both him and Ronaldo played together in the early days, I thought they both could reach a similar level both Rooney has regressed so much and so fast.

6254~~~
This thread makes me lose faith in the average utd fan.

6255~~~
I think Rooney had a good season in 07/08, his quality got us over the hump in a few games in the league and Europe. And his partnership with Ronaldo was indispensable. I wish we scored <i>that </i>chance in the final, would have probably elevated the trio higher in United folklore.

6256~~~
I understand what you mean and while Rooney's never been a Drogba kind of forward, i believe he still has the pace to get first to the ball in the final third and hold onto possession. But it's true that making a turn to shoot when he receives the ball with his back to the goal or fighting to win a challenge in the box are things that aren't in his repertoire. That's the reason why i believe the best way to get the best out of him is by using two inside forwards on the wings.

I'm not trying to make any excuses for him, this season he's been quite mediocre. But he can score 'classic forward' goals, by making late runs in the box, he can shoot from distance, he can play one-twos near the edge of the box and provide key passes and assists in the final third. I don't understand how so many people think that we shouldn't put all of his abilities to good use.

6257~~~
I mostly agree, although Rooney strikes me as the type who wants first team football, so we if signed a new striker and told him he isnt first choice I could see him getting itchy feet.
Also I can imagine the likes of PSG taking him - or City might want to do it just as a statement.

6258~~~
He's so long in the game, his numbers are so high because of that. Even Welbeck could be one of United's leading goalscorers all time if he stayed here his whole career, lets say from 18 to 34 is 16 years, score 10 goals a season on average for the biggest club in PL and you have 160 goals, it's special that you could average that for such a long period, but it doesnt make you a great imo, in terms of the real quality that you portrayed over the years..to me, Rooney has been at the very top of the world for just 2 seasons, but so have so many many other players. I wont put Rooney in a bracket of the best strikers of all time,  the likes of Pele, Van Basten, Fenomeno, and I doubt I would rate him in the category below, Ibra, Suarez, Henry, Raul etc.

6259~~~
he slimmed down a lot for the world cup and has maintained that level. he doesn't have the bulk he used to (not a bad thing, he would be slower), plus he is hitting 30

6260~~~
He was faster when he was 'fat' imo, or he looked faster. He has barely outpaced a player this season.

6261~~~
yes but that was when he was younger. before the world cup scholes and other pundits were saying he has more mileage and past his prime while his age says he should be peaking. he is physically in decline to what he used to be but is the best he can be now

6262~~~
Would be a pity, his decline physically began after 2009/2010, aged something like 25? He's never been so strong and fast eversince.

6263~~~
yeah plus he chose not to keep himself tip top. cigs, beer, being sent to fat camp mid season. likely why fergie had enough knowing he had the best of him. he could have squeezed another 2 years in beast mode if he was smart

6264~~~
Nobody would ever accuse Wayne Rooney of being smart

6265~~~
So Valdes answered MUTV's quickfire questions and answers with Rooney ("Wazza") to the "Who's the fastest player?" question.

Just find it weird. Back in the day he was on the rapid side, and without the ball you can tell that his bursts are fantastic. It's just strange that he doesn't use it often on the pitch. I think his issue is acceleration perhaps. Bit slow getting off the mark but when he's in full flow, he's up there.

6266~~~
I think he fancies himself as an intelligent player, and sometimes when you try and play football with your brain, rather than your physical attributes, this happens.
Hes more looking for the intelligent pass, than getting the ball and looking to beat his man.
When we're on the break and hes in full flow, he does still look quick

EDIT: Also being quick over 100m in training is one thing, its an entirely different thing to be able to produce that burst of speed multiple times during a 90+min game (fitness) not that I am saying Rooney isn't fit btw, just an example

6267~~~
I go to games, and the crowd adores Rooney and think he's the key man.

I come on here, and everyone seems to think he's the main problem, is massively overrated, and is in severe decline.

Love it.

6268~~~
And people thought he would fall out with LVG but: 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/netherlands/18413/louis-van-gaal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Louis van Gaal</a> has praised <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/england/1681/wayne-rooney" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wayne Rooney</a>'s work as <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en/teams/england/97/manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a> captain this season, saying he is proud of the striker.

Rooney was announced as skipper following the Dutchman's appointment as manager last summer after a number of players were trialled wearing the armband during pre-season.

Van Gaal hailed Rooney's work rate behind the scenes and his versatility on the pitch after making more appearances in a deeper midfield role rather than as a focal attacking point.

"Wayne is a very good captain. I am very proud. I haven't had any disappointments this year with him," he told reporters.

"He is very good in the dressing room. He is always an example of the training pitch and when we play in matches, he always fights until the end.

"Wayne has also played a lot of positions for me without ever complaining. I like multi-functional players and the team needs more players like him.

"I think that I made a very good decision with Wayne because have fought right until the end in all of our matches. The team spirit has been great."

6269~~~
This summer, we need to find the perfect partner for him. Playing Rooney off a pacey striker is key, less pressure from defenders as they'd be more wary of defending against the pace of the other forward, meaning more space for him. 

I thought he had a decent partnership with Hernandez, it's just unfortunate that Hernandez lacked a few attributes.

Have we seen Wilson and Rooney paired up together yet? Maybe for a brief cameo with Wilson coming on, but not for a good period of time I believe. Would be good to see that on tour.

6270~~~
We have. Can't remember which match it was but Wilson found so much space many many times yet Wayne refused to pass the ball to him.

6271~~~
It was against Arsenal, I think.

6272~~~
Really depends on where you sit <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Where I sit he will get slated whenever he's shit and rightly fully so but if I have to sit in my brothers seat it's a Rooney love fest. To be honest Streety is full of some of the most fickle people you will ever meet, booing him and calling him a scouse bastard when he wanted to leave and then singing his name when he scores.

6273~~~
I think it was a home game.

6274~~~
Does'nt have the same fire in him like in his earlier years here, he had a great season in 2010, played up front as the main forward scored a bucket load, I know he has been moved around a lot but over the past few seasons his performances are inconsistent, no matter where he plays there is a certain standard to be met and he hasn't done it for a number of seasons, he does "well" and "ok" over the course of a season but he is on similar salaries to messi and Ronaldo, but you are not getting the same output as those players, SAF wanted rid and that was going to happen until his retirement and then moyes locked him in a ridiculous contract.  Think he has done well as a captain but his personal performances continue to underwhelm and his reputation is kept alive with a scattering here and there of impressive goals aided by favourable protection from the media as he is an England golden boy.

6275~~~
According to Valdes, Rooney is the fastest player in the team.

6276~~~
yep. and there's a difference between being multi functional (blind) than being put in a position and taking one for the team. with rooney as a supposed midfielder there are 3 teams better than ours

6277~~~
Interesting ESPN Article from LVG's perspective on Rooney's leadership.

6278~~~
His acting in that trailer park commercial was pretty solid. I found him very believable as a bearded slob.

6279~~~
Stand corrected....Not popular on here  but, I agree.

Can't wait till we discuss his 09/10 season again....Or the time we sent him to fat camp and he scored a bicycle kick

So true.

<i><b>Wayne Rooney</b> reflects on his first season as Manchester United skipper, discusses his relationship with Louis van Gaal and outlines his aims to lift silverware while wearing the armband...</i>

<b>What was your initial reaction to the appointment of Louis van Gaal as manager and how you have found working with him this season?</b>
It was exciting really, to have the chance to work under him. The record he’s got shows that he is a top manager and since he’s come in he’s been fantastic. He had faith in me and made me captain. Seeing the way he works and his different style of management, it’s clear why he’s been successful.

<b>Were the arrival of so many new faces and injuries to key players both reasons for the team's slow start to the campaign?</b>
The manager came in with new ideas, a new way to play, new training methods and we did find that difficult at first. The manager told us before we started that we were going to find it difficult and it just took a little time to transfer our work on the training pitch to the games. There were also a lot of new players who came in during the summer and it can be difficult for them to bed into a new league and a new team. It was always going to take a while for them to settle in. The injuries didn't help, but I still think we should have done better.

<b>How would you assess your own performances this season?</b>
I think my form’s been good. I’ve played in a few different positions and scored a few goals, but I could probably have scored more. Overall I’m happy with my first season as captain, glad that we’re back in the Champions League and I’m looking forward to trying to help the team be successful next season.
<b>
<b>How much have you enjoyed the responsibility of being captain and what does it mean to you?</b></b>
It was a huge honour to be given the captaincy, it was something I really wanted to do and hopefully I can be successful. There was no silverware for us this season, but it was really important that we got back in the Champions League, which we managed to do. Next season the focus will be on winning some silverware and I hope I can lead the team to doing that.
<b><b>
<b>How pleased are you to have finished in the top four?</b></b></b>
Top four was a must, really. We had to get ourselves back into the Champions League and we’ve managed to do that. Hopefully that will provide a springboard for us to go and fight for silverware next year.
<b><b><b>
<b>What are your aims and ambitions for next season?</b></b></b></b>
We haven’t discussed them yet. For now, we'll look forward to a good pre-season when I’m sure the manager will lay out what he wants from us. I think we have to try and win whatever competition that we’re in. That’s what we always try to do. It’s important that we push on and try to win whatever we're involved in.

6282~~~
Rooney, ADM and Wilson were brilliant on the counter against Arsenal. We really showed that day what we can do with some pace.

6283~~~
The fans that go to OT are some of the best in the world, the fans on here are arguably some of the worst in the world.

6284~~~
So the fans here are the worst in the world for voicing opinions that have actual truth to them? The same fans who would go to OT if they had the chance and cheer despite what they might say here? Don't be stupid.

6285~~~
Yet it's a fantastic forum.

6286~~~
"Every single one of us will stand by David Moyes" - remember that one?

Herd mentality.

6287~~~
What I find ironic is that the media made a huge push that Rooney needs to leave Everton to join United or Arsenal because it would benefit the national team. That worked out well aye.

6288~~~
On Rooney though. He seems to be highly spoken of by his fellow pro's and managers.  People love to dish out the Scholes quotes but I bet you could find similar ones for Rooney by some of the games greats. You will miss him when he is gone that is for sure.

6289~~~
Nothing wrong with supporting the manager while he's still at the club. As it should be.

I think he'll retire in this club.

6290~~~
Of course he will. 300k a week till he's 34 and past it. Who would touch that?

6291~~~
400k. Bound for a pay rise.

6292~~~
He'll be starting even if he's 35.

6293~~~
I believe that most people here believe that Rooney is our best player and he is and will always remain a legend. 

However, most people don't want to repeat this all the time, while the haters spew their vitriol constantly, even when there is no news. This gives the wrong impression but the truth is that they are a tiny minority.

6294~~~
I don't hate Rooney but there's no way he's our best player and I don't see how anyone could think that, let alone the majority. I mean De Gea has been better than him for three years in a row now, and not just slightly better, hugely better.

6295~~~
When thinking about Rooney our fans still have the image of a 25 year old Rooney and fail to see that the current Rooney doesn't even come close to any of the top players around the world. Even from our squad we have a few players that are better than Rooney. He did compare to the best 5 years ago but presently his overall game has declined too much. Sir Alex did predict Rooney won't age well and I suspect he would have sold him if Sir Alex remained manager.

I can't understand how so many can continue backing him and leave him free from criticism after games were he does nothing at all to help our cause while pointing fingers at Mata, Blind or any other player.

6296~~~
Even Messi and Ronaldo would struggle to score goals in this current United team. 

We just don't create enough chances for the strikers. For me it's been a combination of our midfield players being woefully shite in doing anything other than keeping possession and LVG's horrifically negative tactics.

Until we start playing free flowing attacking football ANY forward is going to suffer.

6297~~~
When LVG said we have the best fans in the world he wasn't referring to the numpties on here.

6298~~~
What about the fans on this forum that go to OT?

6299~~~
Shouldn't you be perpetuating the Messi Ronaldo, or some equally shit thread, with your 'analysis'? This forum can be good but certainly not due to the likes of you and your inane ramblings relating to the same old exhausted topics.

6300~~~
It's a bizarre statement, they arent judging players during the matches, they're signing out loud, and then those fans too after the match, or in the pubs etc discuss about certain things and criticise too. You cant compare these 2 sets of fans, because being United supporter while a game's on, isnt the same as being a United supporters who's discussing.

6301~~~
You sound like you're on your periods. No one cares about your pointless ranting and raving. If you don't like this place then don't post. None here will be missing out that's for sure.

6304~~~
You should get out of your house, and try and get laid tonight. It will do you the world of good and I'm sure the internet can cope without hearing your opinion on Messi Ronaldo for the 10000000th time.

6305~~~
Not sure what you're on about, mate. The reassuring thing is I think neither are you.

6306~~~
Back to that Rooney guy, eh?

Let's not let anger issues mess another thread up and divert it to nowhere?

Anyways,  think Rooney should do well next season. He's lost a bit of brilliance but is clearly having a good effect on the dressing room so I'm expecting good things. The move to him further forward and less involved in the buildup is a very good one.

6307~~~
It doesn't work that way. A forward has to create space, have a good touch and make intelligent runs so that he opens up opportunities to receive the ball in good positions. Chances can't be created if those 3 attributes are missing and Rooney was lacking in all 3 this season. 

Did Liverpool's playmakers suddenly turn to shit? Did Mata suddenly become bad at creating chances after being only 2nd to David Silva in chances created from open play before joining us? 

Rooney was never a 20 goal a season striker and he will never be. He only managed that tally twice in his career whilst when we brought an in form RVP in his first season managed over 30 goals.

The striker is the biggest part of the equation and you can look at any team for these kind of examples like Chelsea and Diego Costa from struggling to score goals, going to scoring goals for fun when he was fit for the first half of the season and then going back to struggling when he got injured.

6308~~~
I'm sure you don't!

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6309~~~
He almost hits 20 every season despite not always playing right up top, though? Not a stretch to think he could a few more.

I agree that he isn't as good a striker as Costa/aguero and isn't likely to have a 35 goal season, but he's definitely a 20 goal a season striker.

Or did you mean only league?

6310~~~
Take your fake laughing smileys elsewhere, saddo. They're bringing irrelevance to another thread.

6311~~~
Yes, league. I failed to make it very clear but I'm mostly annoyed by those 5 world class performances Rooney has in recent seasons. Why can't he do that every week? He goes from doing everything perfectly in one game to failing to control the simplest of touches the following week. I think this is why his league goal tally struggles. He is getting less consistent. The Rooney in those 5 games a season in which he shows up and the Rooney in the rest of the games are like totally different players.

6312~~~
To be honest, I expected more as well but I'm past expecting him to perform like a world beater week in week out. It hasn't looked like happening for a while now. If he can be a regular goalscorer for us who gives us composure in front of goal and maturity as a senior player, then I'm happy with him. I do have doubts about his general play and would ideally like us bring someone in to rotate with him, someone who has more technical class and raw impact on games, but I'm not sure we will. 

But overall, given this team has spent a season learning lvg's ways, like others, I think we will see a better Rooney next season.

6313~~~
I think managing that Tally twice (in the only 2 seasons where played upfront as the main man) makes him a 20 goal a season striker, Rooney was only a few goals behind Shearer's EPL record.

The only thing i agree with you on is his first touch, which is bad but not as bad as people make it out to be, it seems like the go-to Rooney criticism when all else fails.

6314~~~
Forums very rarely mirror the mentality of the game going fans.

On this forum you have threads about Fergie and Rooney and their mistakes and declines. Incredible stuff.

6315~~~
What does rating Rooney have to do with fans in the stadium? I don't rate him highly but when I am at OT and the crowd sings his name, I join in. Same with the Ronaldo song (well in contrast to Rooney I do rate Ronaldo very highly) but I would rather prefer frequent songs about current players, still I join in in stuff which creates good atmosphere. That doesn't mean that later in the pub or whereever ppl don't get annoyed with the same players' performances or don't discuss them.

6316~~~
Wow this thread is moving in a tiresome direction.

6317~~~
I support Man Utd. I want us to win every game and I do not care which individual scores once we win. This, however, does not mean I have to follow the crowd. It is human nature to convince oneself that one's own beliefs are correct and others must be wrong. My country is the greatest on earth, my race, my religion, my gender is superior to others who are different. Heck some even thought that their planet, Earth, had to be the most important thing in the universe and even the Sun revolved around it.
Therefore I am not surprised that the English public and especially most Utd fans bought into the feeling that Rooney is one of the greatest footballers in the world and a Utd legend. He is ours so he must be the best. This kind of thinking makes him highly marketable and thus his weaknesses are overlooked and the "intangibles" come into play, work rate, intelligence, leadership by example etc. His records are a façade. As I have said before any very good player consistently playing as an attacker for Utd and England would have as many goals as him. If some of the legends of English football played the number of qualifying matches that he has I am sure they would have more goals eg Charlton and Linneker and they actually performed well in the big international tournaments.
I undertand why most look at him with such awe but I am sorry I just see an above-average footballer with limited technical skill.

6318~~~
On top of that he also made Nani cry and made him leave United <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6319~~~
Two points.

One, the Internet is a place where every one has a voice and the ability to make it visible hence you'll always get stronger opinions and a greater volume of them, which leads to a large number of extreme ones. It's just the nature of the Internet and as much a reflection of the medium really.

Second, the stadium is meant for supporting. An Internet forum is meant for discussing. It's two completely different things. I wouldn't expect people at a stadium watching a game to be daicussing Wayne Rooney's decline over 5 years, or sir Alex's transfer success in recent times. I would totally expect it on the Internet. That's what this place is for.

Also, while I disagree with extreme views, why exactly wouldn't there be discussion on those two topics on a DISCUSSION forum? Unless you prefer this place being like RAWK where some things are bizarrely off limit.

Yeah I don't get the correlation either. I mean sure the Internet gets you a bigger array of strongly put opinions and hence you get loads of weird ones, but it's what you do on the Internet - discuss things to the bare bones.

6320~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He will never live that down.

6321~~~
I honestly think Rooney runs Manchester United from behind the screen.

Glazers and managers are just his puppets on the string who this brilliant, yet evil, mastermind plays as it wants.

"Limited technical skill"?

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6323~~~
Yea ok <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> been to countless OT games over the years where turds are criticising and laughing Giggs for half the game, turn up and expect to be entertained with a high and mighty attitude, there are bellends everywhere.
No idea why anyone would bring up the OT fanbase persepctive of Rooney as an indication anyway when they've booed him at times between his 2 public fallouts and booed him on the last title winning parade/speech.

6324~~~
SAF did want to sell him.

His plan was to get Kagawa and RVP as the striker and number 10.

6325~~~
You're linking us goals from very old performances and from recent top performances he rarely has.

I could link you a dozen full matches, not 1 or 2 touches highlighting how bad he can be when he doesn't turn up for a game, just from this season.

You're a case in point of those that still think of Rooney as the 25 year old version.

I love Rooney, I really do. I'm a big fan but when I watch a game I can tell when he's playing well or being below par and the former is becoming less frequent.

6326~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Why didn't Cathy persuade Ferguson to not retire again?

6327~~~
Cathy's sister died and SAF's hip went all shit.

I think most expected him to stay on, Ronaldo would of came back as well.

6328~~~
I agree with most of what you said there but to say he has limited technical ability is just silly. He's amongst the best in the world when it comes to that. How many other players could have scored just one of those goals?

6329~~~
Is it really that silly though? If you break down the key technical skills like heading, shooting and the long pass to the right, I'm sure Rooney is technically sound, but the other technical skills like a first touch, dribbling, beating a man, picking a slide through pass, ect he is absolutely woeful. Id say even his strong points like shooting from distance   has regressed. He may score the odd worldie now and again but not with the same consistency you would expect from some who is rated by his fans as world class.

6330~~~
Lol. They would both score 30 to 40 every season.

6331~~~
I know its hard for some to accept that which is clear to objective eyes but does anyone really think he can lead us back to glory? Maybe we all have different opinions on what constitutes technical ability, however, I think a really great player is one who you can just give the ball to and watch him work his magic and save the day. Whether it is him going on a solo run dribbling past a few players and slotting the ball into the goal or setting up a sitter for a team-mate.
When we are losing I do not get the impression that Rooney will come to our rescue with some World Class skill.
If he is too expensive or worth too much with respect to marketing I can see that it would be difficult to get rid of him but it will probably mean 2 or 3 more years of no trophies. I do not see anyone short of Ronaldo or Messi that can come to Utd and supplant him as the main man, Plus, if the Glazers are the kind of owners that I think they are I do not see them giving up the marketing bonanza that would occur as Rooney approaches breaking Charlton's record and even moreso Shearer's prem record.
It all depends on how LVG feels and how much power he really has.

6332~~~
He has been pretty average the last few games, but i also think it's because he is being told by LvG to keep the defenders busy, Rooney should be involved more in the build-up.

6333~~~
I'm Irish....Couldn't give a shit....

Big Dunc....Always have time for him

6334~~~
They'd score a ton still but a lot less then they normally would.. We don't create enough, or haven't most of the time this season.

6335~~~
Precisely the point I was trying to make

6336~~~
Yes, I do. And many other people rate him very highly (including Mourinho). He has been our best player in the past 10 years and he will probably remain so for the foreseeable future. Yes, Ronaldo and Messi are better, but in EPL? ... I would not replace Rooney with any other EPL forward.

6337~~~
He was not our best player this last season, De Gea was by far.
He was not our best player 2 years ago, that was RvP.
He was not our best player when Ronaldo was here his last 3 seasons.
He was not our best player when Giggs was still in his prime.
I also think Vidic was our best player one season not too long ago.

By my count that leaves maybe 3 seasons where Rooney was our best player. That's a great record and I'll forever admire Rooney in his prime. But please, don't say such silly things like he has been our best player for 10 years. It's just not true.

6338~~~
To be fair, Rooney undoubtedly played an important role in our championship seasons but my point is that he was never the main man when we won.
Even after Ronaldo left the 2 seasons that we won were more due to VDS, Nani and Vidic in 10-11 and RVP in 12-13.

Simply put we need a better player to be our main man.

6339~~~
I see it as an example where supporting an individual was confused with, and put before, supporting the club.

6340~~~
Rooney's a great footballer and we're lucky to have him.

The problem is with him being captain - he isn't a great captain and it doesn't bring out the best in his game AND he shouldn't be undroppable.

I personally still think Rooney with a proper midfield behind him will score 25 goals a season if played as a 9 all season, but if we start seeing the 'midfield experiment' again I think we can forget any silverware for the immediate future.

This team, playing Van Gaal's football...

------------------GK----------------
RB-----Smalling-----Rojo----Shaw
-----Carrick------------Schneiderlin
Mata----------Herrera------Memphis
----------------Rooney--------------

Would challenge any competition it was in.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6342~~~
He has been our best player in the past 10 years taken collectively. No other player has been as important as Rooney for the past 10 consecutive years. 


(Plus: Every player had good and bad years with us. Giggs, PVP, Ronaldo, even Vidic. Rooney did not have bad years. Every single year he is among our 3 best players. )

6343~~~
Just off the top of my head he wasn't one of our best 3 players in 07/08 and 12/13. I don't think he was last season either but that would be more debatable.

6344~~~
We need to get him to stop singing.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lovQNCJsX9Q?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

6345~~~
Those moments happen too often with him in position where a good control would create a good opening. It can so frustrating at times, specially when in certain matches you can see that his touch is just perfect. I don't think there is a player whose touch can go from being great to shit so regularly.

6346~~~
We're Manchester United, we might have had a bad season followed by a mediocre one, but we haven't sunk to the depths of being lucky to have an over the hill striker that can't consistently control a football. He's the lucky one in this scenario.

6347~~~

6348~~~
Guy's a pro.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/imTRekf.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/imTRekf.jpg"/>

6349~~~
Rooney and Kagawa would have been so much better, played consistently, and without van Persie. Throw Welbeck in too, and there was potential for great play.

6350~~~
Hmm, Rooney with a playmaker behind him, rather than him being the 10.....it's never really happened has it? Or am I missing someone for England or Man Utd? The times with Ander last year come closest or with deeper playmakers in Scholes, Carrick or Giggs, though they were mostly in 2 man midfields with Rooney dropping deeper for someone else.

Although Kagawa's pretty much the only one anyway in his time, I guess they pushed big for Sneijder to try this.

6351~~~
I think they showed a good understanding very early on. Even in the opening game, away at Everton. He also showed signs of a partnership developing with Welbeck the season before, with some great one-touch goals.
I think perhaps something like Welbeck up top, with Rooney and Kagawa as two second strikers. All of them having a degree of freedom.

van Persie, on the other hand, hadn't played in a partnership for years. He played there for a bit after moving from a wide forward position, I think. But his game changed quite a bit, and the van Persie who took on the main number 9 role for Arsenal was never in a partnership.
His whole approach to playing up front was that of a lone striker.

That's so typical Rooney. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6354~~~
From Rooney's facebook page:

"Delighted that me and <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/coleenroo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Coleen Rooney</a> have our 3rd child on the way"

Congrats Wayne!!! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Rooney scored a hattrick. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6355~~~
Someone must have said it already but I think we should drop out the 'knockout performance' part in the thread title. It actually makes him sound world class.

6356~~~
At the time of making, it was tongue in cheek add-on to the title for his "knockout, the performance act" video that circulated over the internet.

The thread is dead in a week or so anyway, 2015/16 Godlike Performances of the Captain coming up.

6357~~~
Change it to knock-up performances?

Kin'ell it's nearly all gone.

6362~~~
Just let it go lad.

6363~~~
Can't even do up the bottom button on his jacket. Fatty.

6364~~~
Hair today, gone tomorrow.

6365~~~
Not one of your best mate. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6366~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> True. I should be transferred to Fener immediately. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6367~~~
Pretty good one imo !

6368~~~
You are too drunk from celebrating our treble signing. Thankfully you have an otherwise great record, so this poor showing will be forgotten soon.

6369~~~
This is a good sign, this means he'll have a good season.

6370~~~
Obviously Wayne's hair fell out in shock when he heard of today's signings.

6371~~~
These are old photos from a previous Wimbledon final

6372~~~
That's a fashion "rule", you're not supposed to do the bottom button on jackets.

6373~~~
So obviously he'll be #1 choice lone striker next season.

I think he'll be due quite a lot of stick on here. He's going to have a lot of games where he's very quiet and not see much of the ball, i can see his role being the same as the one he played against City. Did not see much of the ball but kept defenders busy.

6374~~~
Best thing bout this weekend is that we'll never see him in midfield again.

6375~~~
I assumed so, due to lack of crushed Weetabix quiff

6376~~~

6377~~~
yup

6378~~~
Oh God.

6379~~~
Every player doing that drill was sloppy to be fair.

6380~~~
Oh my.

6381~~~
Do you have a link to a video of it?

6382~~~
Just sell him already. <span style="color: #ffffff">You had to check. That's how fecked up this forum is about Rooney.</span>

6385~~~
Darmian looks rapid.

6386~~~
He is. Coupled with his stamina, the guy is a machine. Will be an absolute beast of a signing if he can accomodate into life in England. He is made for the PL in my opinion.

6387~~~
Nah that touch is definitely intentional. The coach (can't remember his name) seems to clearly stop the drill to say something to Schneiderlin & Herrera.

6388~~~
Memphis' lay off as well as his first touch was very sloppy!

6389~~~
Looks nice the pitch and the surroundings. The players just started, all a bit rusty

6390~~~
Tbh it looked like none of them had properly got their heads around the drill (when to pass, who to etc), hence the sloppiness.

6391~~~
The players haven't played or trained for at least a month, so there's bound to be a lot rustiness to shake off. 

As for Rooney himself, his touch has always been inconsistent. Thats never going to change.
