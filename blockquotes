					Where are all those people who though we would look so much better with Mkhi on the right giving us width unlike Mata who always drift inside, and thinking Valencia is going to be more dangerous going forward too? Mata drifting inside and acting as a midfielder has so many good things people ignore to see, football isn't all about just staying wide and trying to get past the player. Once you play a player who actually stays wide you won't have much space on the right like we have when Mata plays there. He also gets the best out of Valencia. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, today's game was harder than last few games, but it's never going to be that simple as many thought it will be once we drop Mata.

</div>Its not what I'm saying. He's a nifty player who can play very well when pockets are created by pacey players stretching the defence. He can smartly drift into various areas (outwide and infield)and add more value when he actually has a competent partner on the same flank to do so. Every wide player depends on his full back to aid in creating space when there is an attack on, its just a shame Darmien is terrible at doing so.<br/>

If you put Mkhitaryan on instead of Mata, he would also look subdued on the flank because Darmien is that poor offensively.

</div>What I mean is that there are certain jobs a right winger/midfielder has to do. No matter how good they are at coming inside and finding space they still have to trouble the left back, stretch the play and deliver service from out wide. Mata can't do that and instead relies on his fullback to do so. So Mata's OK as long as somebody else is fulfilling his primary duties.<br/>
<br/>
Mkhitaryan would play better with a top class fullback behind him yeah, see goes for any player. However even with Darmian behind him he can still beat a fullback, cross with his right foot etc.

					This is a huge game for Mata and the club. Hope he plays well as a #10, presuming that's where he plays.

					Unfair that it comes to a do or die type situation ,whilst fatty was given 3 years to improve, but it really is a DorD for Mata today in my view.<br/>

He has to utilize the runners, pick the passes and unlock the door.<br/>

Over to you Juan.
