He is got to be to itching to come back. He is going to wanna get in on this fun. A new system, a new challenge under a manager he works very well with. Cant wait for him to be back.

2~~~
Say RvP is very eager to get back to working with LvG, there was talk of him about not wanting to take a holiday and return immediately but even though it's good to hear, with his injury record, wise decision to take a holiday and not rush back. 

Motivation for RvP this season will be high after a nightmare last year under Moyes.. Him and LvG seem to really get on and form a good working partnership. 

He should be fully fit and raring to go by the start of the season and one would believe with the opening run of games, that RvP will be high scoring.

3~~~
Hopefully he doesn't have another injury hit season.

4~~~
Part of that was Moyes, this season should be different. The quotes from the Dutch fitness coach are online.

5~~~
I really hope he can slot into this front 2 ahead of Mata effectively. At the moment Welbeck's energy and movement is doing wonders for Rooney, and RVP won't offer that to the same extent. Which would be fine if we had Januzaj buzzing around but obviously with this formation, no wingers...

I'm sure it'll be fine - LVG knows Robin's game inside out, after all. Just voicing a slight anxiety.

Puts Rafael's groin injury into a different light, doesn't it?

Will Van Gaal end the two-a-days once he's satisfied that his system is in place?

7~~~
Again that turd of a coach. Has an agenda against United it seems.

8~~~
It's said by Verheijen, he's a clueless twat who hates United. Anything he says should be put into the bin.

9~~~
He needs to get some games in pre season. I'm dying to see what hes like at United under Van Gaal.

10~~~
Someone's brought this up in the Welbeck thread and reminded me about it.

Of late have other people noticed how prolific Van Persie is at being caught offside?

Back end of last season and at the World Cup he was absolutely on fire. It's not as if he's trying to be clever about it with marginal calls against him and being onside a good deal too, he mostly just seems to be standing about 3 yards offside but still motioning for the ball. He was caught offside 9 times against Costa Rica.

Still love watching him play when he's onside, but don't remember this being so much of a feature in his game during his first season with us.

11~~~
Nah man I get annoyed just reading this, because people in Holland were going nuts after the Costa Rica game too.

While in reality his movement and awareness is better than, well basically every other striker around. Sometimes you're just unlucky.

And for the Costa Rica game: he was flagged two or three times while he wasn't offside or it was a marginal centimeter or something. He simply got the ball too late 3 times at least. Leaves 3 offsides in a very, very tight game with Costa Rica playing the offside trap to perfection.

Such a shame we don't have a Pirlo or something in our midfield, then we would see the true quality of his movement. I remember even Alex Song managed to give 8 or 10 assists to RvP at Arsenal from midfield, simply playing the ball over the defense at exactly the right moment. Fabregas linking up with him was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Clasie's pass vs. Ecuador comes to mind. He needs players who pass like that and players like Mata (noticed how he immediately found RVP in his first or second match for us) , well he doesn't need them because he scores a lot anyway, but that would truly get the best out of him.

12~~~
I really don't see it that way! The amount of times he was caught offside in the latter stages of the season annoyed me, so I focused on him at the World Cup and it was the same thing. To me he never seems to be looking along the line, so he really does rely on the perfect early pass which to be honest is rarely ever going to happen. Not everyone is going to be on the same wavelength or even close yet he never seems to hold his run.

13~~~
This is just so wrong, but if you feel that way, fine. Everyone has flaws, but like I said his movement and awareness are better than any other striker out there imo, as perfect as it comes. Yet somehow he never seems to be looking along the line? And he should stop moving so brilliantly because some players don't have the vision to play a good pass?

For me that's like saying Messi or Iniesta should stop dribbling, or start dribbling in another way because they lost the ball a couple of times when trying to outplay opponents.

14~~~
if you're talking about costa rica, that was the team that had 30+ offside calls in their favor over the course of their world cup journey so isolating RVP is just plain unfair

15~~~
I see it from your view, but if the pass doesn't arrive it's probably worth making an effort to get back onside. For me the lazy part comes from the fact he almost always refuses to do this, so then when said inferior player finally looks up and plays a pass he's just standing there in an offside position.

I'm repeating myself here, but I don't really think it's unfair to point this out when he was caught offside 9 times in one game. I've never heard of such figures before.

16~~~
yeah costa rica played a fantastic offside trap that game. perhaps you need to see it from more than one viewpoint.

17~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thescore.com/news/533117" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thescore.com/news/533117</a>  : Costa Rica exit World Cup with more than twice as many offsides <b>drawn</b> than any other side

Not unfair to point it out, but Costa Rica did really well and considering RvP was the only real striker, with Robben moving more sideways and into the ball and having a very different playing style, it's not that shocking.

18~~~
When is he back btw?

19~~~
On Monday

Also i'm surprised....i thought he will get a 4 week break

20~~~
No I think they mentioned three weeks. So I guess after the tour.

21~~~
I mean next Monday <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

22~~~
I want to see how Rooney and Van Persie plays together under Van Gaal. I have my concern about the lack of pace between the two/three(mata), but I am sure their quality other than that attribute would make it work out.

23~~~
A shame we haven't seen the best of both so far

2012-2013: Rooney was a lot injured and problems with Fergie
2013-2014: Van Persie was a lot injured and problems with Moyes
2014-2015: Hopefully both stay injury-free and happy threesome between Louis, Wayne & Robin

24~~~
Can't wait for him to be back playing for us, I think his all round  footballing ability is often overlooked when he goes on a run of goal scoring as people will only remember the goals. He'll have a lot more freedom expressing himself in a front 2 that being the main man in front of Rooney.

25~~~
agree with this, Rooney & RVP have rarely been used together as attacking players & when both are fully fit/happy with the manager

26~~~
Anyone think we'll see Rooney and Van Persie fighting for the same spot? Welbeck is a key reason why the 3-4-1-2 has worked successfully for us so far, in my opinion.

27~~~
With the lack of pace in the team, I personally think Welbeck is a must in the team. Not sure which way LVG will go.

28~~~
I think it's the way to go and might be better off for us in the long run, but I can't see Rooney or RvP being dropped.

29~~~
I think both would be fine with LvG occasionally dropping one or the other or substituting one to add a different dimension to our attack. I do think people go a bit over the top with the pace stuff, though. It isn't the be all and end all - as what Rooney and RvP lack in blistering acceleration, they make up for in brilliant attacking movement and general positioning.

30~~~
Looking forward to having him back with the squad. Hopefully he'll be able to get some minutes against Valencia.

31~~~
He's inherited the same problem up top that Fergie created and Moyes was unable to solve. For all their individual excellence, Van Persie and Rooney really don't look like a balanced partnership.

Quite looking forward to seeing how he resolves this. He won't be afraid to ruffle feathers, that's for sure.

32~~~
That much is true Pogue. They hardly combined for the most part last season when RVP was not injured. Hopefully the manager will have them working on combination play, and try to find a happy medium to get the best out them both.

33~~~
Its weird really, because instinctively they feel like they should work together. In playing style they remind me of Cole and Yorke - one a little more of a number 9, one a little more of a number 10, but both able to do both roles and swap according to need. But if Cole and Yorke are at one end of the scale in terms of personal chemistry and understanding, RvP and Rooney seem to be at the other end.

I guess the hope is that if Mata is the one directing their movement, by virtue of the passes he makes, then they may connect a little more neatly then in previous seasons. Rather than trying to find each other with passes, they're just trying not to copy each other's runs.

That said, the upside is that if they dont work, LVG is far more likely to drop them than Moyes ever was.

34~~~
Good point about the Cole/Yorke similarities. It <i>should</i> work but somehow it doesn't. Or at least it hasn't yet.

Rooney's previously shown (with Ruud and Saha) that he can perform well in a strike partnership. He also seems to click quite well with Welbeck. I'm not sure if RvP has much experience of playing as one of two up top, for club or country. So maybe it's just a matter of learning on the job and the more they play together the better they'll get?

35~~~
Strikers working together and linking up is overrated. Its very rare in football actually, thats why everyone makes it a big deal when two strikers form a good partnership. The so called SAS wasn't a great partnership either, it was just two top strikers in great form. 

As long as both RvP and Rooney are scoring and performing it doesn't matter how many times they pass to each other. Mabe it mattered when he was a no.10 but now they'll probably both be playing right along side each other so Mata and wing backs will be the main supply.

36~~~
I think it's more the fact that both Rooney and RVP feel like they are top dogs. Yorke and Cole while being brilliant were not exactly "superstars", I don't think they had the ego, and they certainly had the friendship. They both wanted to score, but were just as happy to see their mate score. 

With RVP and Rooney they clearly dont dislike each other, but when it comes to scoring they want their name on the sheet, rather than their rival.

37~~~
Van Persie will be 31 in a couple of days. Eric had retired by this age. Can't really get my head around that.

Anyhow, how many seasons can Van Persie have left as a striker at the top of his game? 1 or 2? He will obviously be an asset for longer though in a diminished role.

While him getting older sucks, it will probably make things easier moving to a 4-3-3 in time.

38~~~
Given his pace is not a key assest, I can see him being very good going into 35, just depends how he manages his injuries.

I see him more like a Bergkamp/Sheringham type player who doesn't exactly completely diminish with age.

39~~~
That seems feasible come to think of it and would love it to be true. He's never been a speed merchant. Let's just hope he can stay clear of injuries.

40~~~
Rooney has showed many times in the past that he's willing to play 'second fiddle' for the want of a better phrase. In many ways it suits Rooney's natural game as at his best he's the ultimate team player. 
For whatever reason there has been issues surrounding Wayne and his influence on the team during the past 2 seasons, I for one however am sure LVG will set it straight. So long as they are fit RVP and Rooney will both play and they'll be brilliant for us imo

41~~~
I don't think Rooney and Van Persie works in the same team unless Rooney is the number 10...and then there's no room for Mata unless he drops further back...and then there's no room for Herrera unless Carrick/Fletcher play as a centreback.

42~~~
I have never been a big believer in Rooney and Van Persie as a partnership but I think Van Gaal can make it work. The real issue with the Rooney/Van Persie partnership is that nobody seems to have given either clear instructions about how they should work together. Both Fergie and Moyes seemed to think that they could work it out on the field but Van Gaal is too meticulous for that. Van Gaal will give them both a very clear, very definite role and demand they stick to it. That will help them not to step on each others toes, and know how they should play off and with each other.

Van Persie spent weeks with Holland acclimatising to the #9 role in Van Gaal's 3-5-2, he won't need to learn it again. Plus, throughout pre-season, Rooney has being doing the role Robben played in the Dutch World Cup team. Its early days, but to my eyes, the Robben role has brought the best out of Rooney too. Provided they stick to their defined roles, and Van Gaal won't tolerate anything else with his match cameras tracking their every move, Rooney and Van Persie will function effectively together.

PS) I think a lot Rooney's improvement this pre-season has come from having a manager who gives him unmistakeable orders. There's no talk about playing off the cuff or relying on instinct. Van Gaal has a clear way of playing, all the players say so, and he is just putting square pegs into square spaces according to his philosophy. Rooney's loving it. He's not wandering off around the place, when he drops in Mata instantly exchanges with him. Rooney doesn't have to worry about how things are meant to go and as a result the hesitancy we saw from him last year is gone.

43~~~
I agree, I'm actually quite positive about their partnership this season, with Mata in behind too.

44~~~
Why not? they've never played up front with each other in a 442 or a 352 so how can you judge? I think they'll work very well considering they're not just goal scorers but very talented all rounded footballers.

45~~~
I can't remember the exactly stat but they went something like 24 games and only losing 1 when they both started together. Of course that was before Moyes fecked shit up.

46~~~
We've seen them plenty of times in a 4-4-2 have we not?

47~~~
Let's hope it's more Rooney to Robin ala Aston villa rather than Rooney getting in Robins "space".

48~~~
Tbf the SAS partnership didn't even have half the ability that Rooney and RVP posses. You're right in saying it's goals that count in the grand scheme of things, but with the ability both RVP and Rooney have, you would expect them to be able to play together with much more fluency than they shown last season. If they perform similarly this season, then one of them will be on the bench.

49~~~
They played up front together in a 442 a few times last season, and it was awful. Might be a bit different with someone in behind them but I just don't think it works in general unless at least one of the two can run in behind and stretch the opposition. Welbeck's the only one of the four who can do that. Hernandez sort of can.

50~~~
Fairly sure it was 4411, but even if they did play 442 last year with both of them injured and/or out of form and playing under Moyes its not really fair to judge them.

51~~~
Good post. For now it is all very theoretical (I know it doesn't need saying), with regards to the Rooney-Robben idea & the instructions etc, but I have to agree here. Square pegs into square spaces, as you say - Van Gaal is not going to shoehorn a big name into the side if he thinks it is going to be to the detriment of the side, so he will have his system and play his players in the right position. None of this Moyes business about Rooney being a CB, CM and CF at the same time, with RVP simply expected to 'deal with it' because they're both quality players and should be able to work it out on the pitch themselves. Van Gaal will give them defined roles & they won't spend half of their mental energy on the pitch trying to figure out what they are supposed to be doing.

Van Gaal actually knows his stuff, so I trust he will be able to create a system in which we will see the best of them, whilst also incorporating Mata into the side - if he fails to do this, he will not play the three of them together, and rightly so.

52~~~
In a 3-5-2 system it can be different though I guess. Rooney doesnt have to do the #10 tasks anymore, in which he isn't that good. He can stay further up front with RvP with Mata or Kagawa feeding them. This could be crucial imo.

53~~~
No there were a fair few games where they were both pushed right up top and it definitely didn't work at all.

Why is it unfair to judge them? It's definitely a better judgement for example, than assuming they can play in that system based on absolutely nothing at all.

Also, I can't think of any example of this working without either one striker playing as a no10, or one or both being pacey run in behind types.

54~~~
Please stay fit and bag 25 goals this season.

55~~~
I think it was a system issue. You can't put it all on Van Persie and Rooney when everything about our team was flawed. The team as a whole lacked fluency. The defense distributed poorly and hesitated under pressure, the midfield was non existent and we haven't had an inform winger since 2012.
Its easier to get into a good flow when your whole team is clicking. When everyone is passing well, moving well it opens up space for the forwards and it gives them momentum to carry on good moves higher up the pitch. As long as both strikers are playing well and scoring goals i couldn't careless if they passed to each other twice a match. Strikers are selfish and egotistical by nature so you can't expect them to be as selfless as a midfielder in and around the box.

56~~~
It wasn't just two top strikers in great form, there genuinely was a partnership there and this was something that clicked instantly when Sturridge went to Liverpool in January. You could just see this with their general play in runs, passing and off the ball movement.  Rooney and Van Persie at their very best would be fantastic, but still not have a partnership like that. Sometimes it just happens and sometimes it doesn't. But you are right, partnerships are overrated and as long our strikers produce the goods individually, we are good to go

57~~~
I don't think  it was tbh. They rarely passed the ball to each other and stats showed that in many games they only passed to each other 2 to 3 times during the whole game. If both Rooney and Van Persie start scoring goals galore next season and create the odd assist for each other i can guareentee that fans and the english media will be waxing lyrical about their so called partnership. Suarez and Sturridge didn't even like each other, Carragher has come out and said that Suarez bullied Sturridge last season.

58~~~
Agree with this post. If either of the two weren't as clinical, you can be damn sure the 'SAS' wouldn't have ever be coined.

59~~~
I'm not sure it was a system issue, though, because we all saw how good Rooney and Welbeck linked up in the few games RVP was out last season. 

Personally, I hope Van Gaal can get the best out of the two as a partnership, but like you said, as long as they're both banging in goals, it shouldn't really matter.

60~~~
So he is probably missing couple matches in Prem due to a WC fatigue and getting fit again routine.

Wonder what's up with Welbz if he is injured too, might be a late chance for Nani, Chicharito, even Zaha maybe.

61~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b> Manchester United's Robin van Persie OUT for start of Premier League season says Van Gaal </b></span>

62~~~
This.

First game that comes to mind is when we beat City away 2-3, Wayne scored two and Robin got the lucky winner. Both played excellently in one of the most difficult matches of the season. But under SAF there were numerous examples of Wayne and Robin linking up very well and playing together perfectly. We even played a couple of matches with Rooney-Chicha-RVP upfront and it worked out. But Rooney and RvP are so incredibly talented, in the right tactical set-up they'll perform for sure.

Also, Rooney played at bit more as a #10 for SAF when playing with RvP, while the 3-5-2 system basically forces them to both play a free role upfront. At the World Cup, I actually remember Van Gaal mentioning how Robben and RvP shouldn't waste too much energy on tracking back and all, because they need to stay upfront and make things happen there. So the moment they're both fit and have Mata or Kagawa or whoever behind them it'll be <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Suits Welbeck too, so if Rooney gets a knock, RvP and Welbeck is an excellent pairing.

63~~~
I reckon he'll make his first game of the season in the 2nd Round of the Capital One Cup (Between Matchday 2 & 3)

Btw when was the last time that he had to play in the 2nd Round of the COC???

64~~~
Van Persie has never had to play the 2nd round of the league cup <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

United last played it in like 97 or 98 I think, before they changed it so European qualifiers got a by.

I think it's sensible to keep RVP back till he is fully fit as well tbh, no point rushing him back only for him to get injured or not to be at his best, Rooney looks fit & on form so is bound to be the main striker, I would imagine with Wellbeck alongside him, not sure if Hernadez will stay tbh.

65~~~
<img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

66~~~
Welbeck-Rooney-Mata is working well, which means we don't have to rush RVP back. Ah, the luxuries of having a competent manager...

67~~~
F*cking hell, and it starts to hit home. Be dreading the middle of September.. when the CL starts.

68~~~
Just my two cents on the Rooney, Van Persie, Mata conundrum. Unless Mata has the freedom to play in the position that he's been playing in in these pre-season games with no one getting in his way; then there is absolutely no point in him being in the team, on the pitch, or even at the club. I don't think anyone can argue with that. 

My second point is more up for debate which is that as I've said many times before on here, for me, Rooney, Van Persie, and Mata just can't play together at the same time on the pitch no matter what system you play. Hopefully I get proven wrong because if they can it would be sensational. But right now, the way I see it, it's just not going to happen unless Rooney goes back to being an out an out striker. That's the only way they can all play at the same time together for me.

69~~~
He was voted Chelsea player of the year in season 2012-13 while Oscar played as the number 10?

70~~~
Van Gaal will get the absolute best out of him, I reckon he still has 2-3 great seasons in him. To think he'd very likely have been long gone now had Moyes stayed.

71~~~
Mata actually ended up playing a 10 role in a lot of games that season while Oscar drifted out onto the wing or further forward. And that was at Chelsea who play in a different system with different players. This is here. And last season the only games where Mata played really well were the ones where he played in his preferred role.

72~~~
So we have seen a preseason where Ashley Young has played well at LWB yet people still think players under great coaches can only play/be effective in one position?

73~~~
If he could play well for Chelsea and Valencia in other positions than 10 (indeed he played various roles at Valencia: on the wing, left midfield, 2nd striker; he only got the No 10 role when David Silva left Valencia), then he can do the same at United with the right manager and system.
He will mostly play as a 10 anyway, but make no mistakes, he is versatile enough to play well in different positions.

74~~~
31 today

75~~~
Happy Birthday, Robin. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Wonder if the club will give him a cake?

76~~~
God he is fecking old, hope he really does it for us in the next 2 seasons else he'll be way past it and his transfer will only have been instrumental for one season.

77~~~
Worth it - Even if it was just to piss Arsenal fans off.

78~~~
He's 2 goals from 50 at the moment, would be awesome if he hits 100.

79~~~
Sheringham was older when he was our top scorer, player of the year and crucial to us winning our third title on the trot in 2001.

For me Van Persie has already repaid his transfer fee by guiding us to the 20th title.

80~~~
RvP was worth his fee alone for our 20th title! Imagine if SAF had retired without winning the title back from City! That would have been horrible! 

Oh and I know some ppl love to point out that without RvP other players might have scored his goals - well they might or might not have, but RvP wouldn't have retired but most probably would have joined City instead to win them their 2nd successive title. 

Regarding his future prospects, he doesn't rely on pace and as he has had a lot of injuries and therefore was rarely overplayed (the injury bit being a bit like Giggs in his early years with us), I can actually see him on the top for 2-3 years to come.

81~~~
Panic over.

<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/rW2Lu6w-vk/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

82~~~
I forget how old he is. 31. feck.

83~~~
Yaya Toure likes this (and his agent says he´s a bit envious about it too).

84~~~
31, off the back of an injury hit year and not fit for the start of the season. Doesn't fill you full of confidence does it?

85~~~
Under LvG yeh it does.

86~~~
The only reason he's not fit for the start of the season is because he hasn't trained enough after being given time off following the world cup. On this occasion it's match fitness, rather than an injury.

87~~~
Indeed, though he did get injured at the World Cup and was fairly subdued for at least half the games.

88~~~
Happy Birthday Robin! Saw this and thought its creative:

89~~~
Phew!

90~~~
How does RVP and LVG <b>not</b> fill you full of confidence? You thought he was good before, wait till you see him this season.

91~~~
Apparently he wasn't fully fit for the WC in the first place. Hopefully the rest would have done him some good. Anyway as long as Wellbeck is fit, I don't think we need him for the first few fixtures anyway.

92~~~
Phew! *wipes sweat off brow*

93~~~
Doubt that not in the modern game, how many first choice strikers you know at top clubs being past 33 ? No this will be one of his last seasons I think were he'll be one of our first choice strikers after that we'll have to start looking at replacement, which is also one of the reasons I ain't totally put off by the idea of signing Cavani.

94~~~
RVP's technically fantastic, LVG will manage him well, I don't think RVP will drop off much despite his age. His game has never really about pace, he did seem to be getting caught offside a lot during the World Cup but I'll put that down to fatigue. I definitely think RVP will thrive this season with no midweek games.

95~~~
Drogba and Klose were decent enough with 33/34! It doesn't mean that RvP has to play a full game every 3 days with 33/34, but with a bit of rest between games he would still be great in certain games. Anyway, he is not 33 now anyway, only turned 31!

96~~~
Well yea, I didn't say he is past it, I said 2 years left in him, than he'll be past it however.

97~~~
He's only not going to be fit because Van Gaal planned it that way. He wanted to give him a full break after the WC. If anything that should make you feel more confident, because it means we're happy to rely on the (so far very effective looking) trio of Rooney, Mata and Welbeck in order to let Robin take his time. When he does come into contention he'll be super-fit and raring to go!

98~~~
I agree! At some point near the end of WC, RvP even mentioned he wanted to be part of pre season. But LvG knows exactly what it takes to fully recover from the hectic campaign. And then there's the dilemma as to hoe fit he is after being on holiday for three weeks. But when we have the luxury of not depending on one or two players fitness to start the season, it would only be a good thing. Let him get back 100% and he's lethal again.

99~~~
He will still be our main striker. Rooney had a good pre-season so the hype over him has gone overboard again but when the season starts things will normalize.
It may however, take a couple of games before RVP and Mata become in sync.

100~~~
Its not so simple as that is it, we all thought Giggs was past it at 33, yet he played on till he was 40. Of course not the same player, but it does not mean even after your peak you don't have to suddenly turn shit. Pirlo is still class at 35(?). He could well be the same player at 33 as he is now, you have to take into consideration if he has injury free seasons or niggling injuries etc.

101~~~
I'm looking forward to seeing a fully fit and refreshed RvP. Thinking back to our first season with us and he was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. Even if he never reaches that level again his price and us actually signing him was worth it just for the 20th title.

102~~~
Mainly from watching how RVP played in an LVG team at the world cup.

The obvious assumption is that he was jaded after a long season and this break will get him back to his best. He's extremely fit, so turning 31 shouldn't be a biggie but you can see why people might be a little worried about him getting back to his best. Especially when you consider that the WC followed on from a season where he more often than not looked a shadow of the player he was in his first year with United.

For me, the most important thing is steering clear of injuries. His terrible record at Arsenal must play on his mind when he's feeling a niggle and not 100%. Bound to make him inhibited. Just needs a month or two feeling really well in himself and he'll be able to put that behind him. Delighted LVG isn't rushing him to get ready for the next season. Very good management.

103~~~
He looked really well when I saw him in Ibiza last week. Beautifully maneuvering his jet ski.

He wasn't too pleased when I tried to hug him though.

104~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Don't suppose you gave Justin Bieber a slap while you were over there?

105~~~
Wish I did add to his misery, although getting slapped by Orlando Bloom really is the lowest of the low.

106~~~
Those are midfielders, it is a different thing as a striker for me. I can't see RVP as our main striker when he is like 33+, in fact I hope we still get 2 good years out of him and not 2 injurry infested seasons.

107~~~
He actually said him getting injurred for us was a blessing in disguise for his world cup as he was far better rested and fit to start it, so for me being jaded is no excuse for him not being at his best. The simple reality is that RVP is 31 and clearly reached his top when he was 28-29 playing those 2 fantastic seasons one for Arsenal which earned him his transfer to us and that magnificent last season under SAF were we won the title back. In my opnion that is the best RVP we have ever seen and I think it will be the best one will ever see, you know what phase comes after your top, decline. He might still have something left in the tank for us if he can stay fit, but for me it is clear he is slowly starting to regress and if he keeps on pilling up these injurrys the speed of his decline will just increase. My hope as our main man upfront for the coming years is not on RVP but on Rooney and I believe the club would be wise to look at a replacement for RVP in the coming years.

108~~~
All of that is definitely possible. I'm inclined to be optimistic in general about football, so I'd be hopeful you've got it wrong. No way to be certain one way or another, though.

Re the last sentence, absolutely. Once any player gets to the wrong side of 30, the club needs to start thinking about who will replace him. We dropped a bollock by not doing this with Carrick, who just turned 33. If we'd planned ahead a bit better his injury wouldn't be such a blow.

109~~~
With no European football he might be able to get in a rhythm of playing once a week more often than not, which might make all the difference to his fitness. Given that he still scored plenty of goals in a bad season last time around I'd be hopeful we can get him back to something like his best.

110~~~
Two reasons to be hopeful for this coming season. 

Firstly LVG is sensitive to his fitness - how easy would it have been for a new manager at a big club to give RvP a shorter holiday to get him back for his first game? But instead he insisted he took a full 3 weeks after the WC, even though it meant he wouldn't be fit for the start of the season. So we probably wont see him overplayed or brought back from injury too soon.

The other is that we have long spells this season of weekend to weekend games, with no European involvement. Indeed we probably only have one midweek game before Xmas, other than the league cup (which RvP would rarely feature in anyway). For a player the wrong side of 30 that can be very helpful. If you're carrying a niggle you can take a couple of days off, get some physio, or just do gym work or whatever, and still take part in proper training later in the week and be ready for the weekend. If you're playing midweek you just have to carry on playing until something goes, or start missing games or training.

111~~~
Robben has flourished under LvG fitness wise. If LvG has a similar impact on RvP and Rooney, we'll have the best attack in the league again.

112~~~
Yea sure us not playing as many games will be good for RVPs fitness in turn that will pay off this season. But if you already have to be so carefull about his fitness we can't hope he'll be our main man upfront for the coming years. As I said pray he stays fit and can replicate his best form for atleast one more season, hopefully two and than it is time to replace him.

113~~~
Basically the way I see it as well.  I think this might be his last season as our top striker as I am not sure RVP next season at 32 and with his injury record would be able to play two games a week(assuming we make the CL).

I don't see it as our biggest problem anyway.  If both Mata and Rooney are fit, we have plenty of players who can partner them.  My concern would be if we are missing two of those three, not one.

114~~~
Oh I dont think we should assume he can be our main spearhead for 3+ years. However we're in a funny position with strikers at the mo.

We can't justify buying more young potential, because Danny, Hernandez & Wilson all, to varying degrees, fit the bill and a decision still needs to be made as to whether they're good enough or not.

However we cant justify buying a top level striker either, because the fact is RvP can play a solid number of games, and Rooney is here to stay. 

Fast forward 2 years and those young strikers will either be going/gone, or will have shown enough to put them in the first team. Plus RvP will be 33 & Rooney 31, so ponying up for a top quality striker aged 26-28 makes a lot more sense. Either way its an easier decision then.

115~~~
Cavani?

116~~~
Possibly, but he turns 28 this season so may be a shade too old by the time we're buying.

117~~~
I totally agree with this, we're in a difficult situation indeed. I don't think we'll sign a striker this summer as we have to many other more urgent concerns to adress. Yet next summer I think we'll be looking at our options if Welbeck, Hernandez, Wilson don't look like they can lead the line by then we'll sign somebody I'd say. Cavani would be ideal in that respect.

118~~~
No excuse to buy, the way I see it. Van Gaal will back himself to be able to get Welbeck scoring regular goals, which is really the only thing stopping him from being a top class striker more than good enough to lead the line for us for many years.

Get Wilson game time (either a PL loan or regular appearances on the bench and in cup games for us), and if Welbeck's finishing never does come good, then by the time RVP is too old even to be back-up to Rooney, Wilson will be more than ready. (Usual disclaimer about no guarantees with youngsters, but anyone who's watched Wilson will tell you that he's as sure a thing to successfully transition to the first team as Januzaj was. If people want a young Lewandowski, look no further.)

In the meantime we should do our level best to keep Hernandez, so that if at any point in this transition we find ourselves lacking goals, we've got a guaranteed goalscorer just ready and waiting to step in for a bit.

The idea that anyone would want to buy Cavani seems ridiculous to me.

<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> Technically one of the all time greats imo. Immense compilation.

120~~~
Personally I think RVP aging and becoming a less regular starter will coincide nicely with us moving to a system (433) where we only play with one central striker.

121~~~
That was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
Hopefully under LvG he will feel as appreciated and important as he did here under Fergie. I remember Fergie saying it took our players a while to get used to his runs and his movement and to fully utilise him correctly. Unlike Moyes, LvG already knows how to get the best from him. Fingers crossed he can stay fit and have another excellent season because he's world class imo.

122~~~
His timing is insane. So refreshing to see a player who is better than others because of speed of thought rather than actual speed.

123~~~
When I look at RVP play, it always seems like his control while dribbling is a bit flukey. Like it comes of his shins and knee and he just doesn't seem as graceful as others. But its very effective.

124~~~
I think he's hit the post more than any other player lol, imagine how many goals more he could have had.

125~~~
You are thinking of Suarez there mate, He always seems to get rebounds etc of peoples legs when he dribbles. Scholes actually mentioned this in the world cup. RVP looks flawless, technically.

126~~~
I'm not saying he isn't flawless technically. He is. But It just doesn't seem as graceful as the other good dribblers around.

127~~~
Yeah he was firing on all cylinders at the World Cup.

128~~~
I've seen some people say we might only get a couple more years out of him, but I think he could still be very good at 34/35 for that reason. There's a few players like Ibrahimovic, Ribery, Robben, Toure who are all early 30's and don't look as though they're showing signs of slowing down.

129~~~
I've said this before too, RVP even more so as his game is not reliant on any physical attributes at all, he's a beast with it comes to technical skill and mentality which shows by how many goals he's scored getting in behind the defence regardless of being a 'slow' player.

130~~~
Van Gaal also looks to be taking steps to manage his fitness properly which is good. He was overplayed after coming back from a few games out in November which disrupted his season massively. To be fair to Moyes, the last injury against Olympiakos was from another player so he can't take the blame for that one.

Van Persie also got 15 assists in his debut season, but only 4 last year which to me was a result of the tactics and his injuries. I'd expect his assists to increase this year substantially, especially if Mata plays in his proper position instead of out wide.

131~~~
The prospect of Mata-Rooney-RVP working in tandem whilst being on form is mouth watering.. All three of them capable of scoring and assisting, going to be so nice to watch.

132~~~
Nah, he's just tall. If you get past the idea that all technically gifted players are small, he's actually very elegant on the ball.

He's actually much less capable of what I'd call 'reactive dribbling', where by reacting quickly you can ride tackles, fumble through challenges and survive a bad touch and keep going with the ball, even if opponents are getting a foot in here and there. That's what players like Messi and Suarez are so good at. RVP's the opposite, really: when his dribbles and skills come off, it's through very deliberate, perfect touches of the ball which never let the opponent get near it.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://media.giphy.com/media/TWVbKFIuFwbXW/giphy.gif" src="http://media.giphy.com/media/TWVbKFIuFwbXW/giphy.gif"/>

133~~~
I was pretty much going to post the exact same thing about him being tall that makes it look like he's less 'elegant'. But in truth the way he moves the ball looks amazing.

134~~~
It doesn't even make him <i>look</i> less elegant, if you ask me. It's just that post Guardiola's Barca people have become obsessed with all dribblers being small, and they think that only that low-to-the-ground, scurrying style is attractive. Which is stupid, obviously.

Zidane was built like Van Persie, and his style of dribbling was similar (obviously <i>better</i>, but he moved in a similar way), and he's renowned as perhaps the most elegant player of all time.

135~~~

Took this from Twitter. This happens with anyone. The person writing it could have at least done so in an eligible manner. 

I've met RvP, in Selfridges in Manchester last Ferbruary? He was honestly great, nice bloke, took his time answering a question I had regarding Moyes. If any of you want to meet a footballer from Manchester, go to the City Centre on an off day in the afternoon? They'll be in those expensive stores. I remember coming across Fellaini in Trafford Centre. Damn his afro is nice. He laughed when I said what conditioner he uses, top guy.

136~~~
No I agree with you mate :P I love his style of dribbling and how it looks, I was just putting across a reason as to why other people may not think the same <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

137~~~
Has he returned to training yet? Any pic of him training together with United mates at Carrington?

138~~~

139~~~

140~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Yeah, except that van Persie was Holland's captain and Robben had about 4 passes in whole World Cup, but hey, van Persie is a individualistic cnut.

141~~~
What was the "obvious lack of leadership"? He probably isn't perfect as a captain but that is a big statement to make.

142~~~
I highly doubt he cares that much, really. It's a good move by van Gaal because I think the armband would probably go a lot further towards making Rooney happy here (as he's a long term servant and our more recognized player) than it would've made RvP, who knows himself that he's only here two seasons and is now 31 years old. 

Keeping both players happy is of the utmost importance this season and I think giving Rooney the armband is a step in the right direction.

143~~~
Dont understand why anyone would be making an issue of RvP not getting the armband. Rooney is English, a club veteran for 10 years and will always start when fit so there is no reason for him not to be captain at least in the eyes of LvG.

144~~~
I rewatched the 12/13 season review last night. My god, he was in unbelievable form from the beginning of the season up to around February. Scored some great goals and seemed to score every game. If he starts anything close to that form, we will be in with a shout at the league.

Oh and defensively we were a nightmare for like 3/4 of that season.

145~~~
Thats nonsense to be fair. Kuyt came out and said Van Persie was the leader of the team in the dressing room. He was the one who gave an inspirational half time speech against Spain and also in many other games. Van Persie was unfit during the world cup so it was difficult for him to show some energy on the pitch.

147~~~
Will be good to see him back.

148~~~
Really happy to see him back, hopefully he'll get some playing time Sunday!

149~~~
Definitely glad he is back. Hope he plays some part. Would rather see Welbeck start though (if he is fit), he looked good in pre-season.

150~~~
Oh yes, RvP back up front with Rojo added into the defense and we could see some massive improvements over the Swansea game.  All we need then is Fletcher and Herrera to be on form and <i>should</i> be a comfortable win.

151~~~
Cannot wait to see him back and firing under LVG.

152~~~
Van Persie to Rooney: You're really our new captain?

153~~~
Jones is going in to headbutt Robin there.

154~~~
He's trying to hide his face from the cameras.

155~~~
Too early for him to start but hopefully he'll be at least on the bench. Might need robin to win the game for us.

156~~~
To be honest, I would prefer him to start and score two goals then get subbed at half time than have him come on when after halftime with us still 0-0 or 1-0 down to Sunderland.

157~~~
I miss his crispy passing and finishes.

158~~~
His arrogance is brilliant to watch. He isn't proper big headed, it's just he has this cool approach to things. His whole mannerisms like his walking, is brilliant.

159~~~
This is bordering on gay.

160~~~
If Welbeck is still recovering then i'd rather see RVP upfront rather than any other striker/attacking player.

Last season and maybe even more this season! United need there senior players to carry the team. Rooney has his flaws but in recent times he is the only senior player that has managed to keep a decent level. I really hope RVP has a great season!!!!! c'mon Robin

161~~~
any good compilations of him for his time at united ?

163~~~
Flip, I forgot how good some of those goals were. Truly a fantastic buy by Sir Alex.

164~~~
Great player and all its great that we have him, but was it really a great buy? Was pretty short sighted at the time, won us a title sure but in the process it screwed over like 4 other players. Rooney became unsettled, Welbeck was shifted out to the wing and Hernandez became purely a sub with no hope of starting, and then it also forced Kagawa out wide or to the bench. SAF basically ripped up any plans he had to build a squad that summer and decided to just sign him, which in the process gave us such a poorly balanced squad right now. He won us the title that first year and is a world class player of course, but I'm not sure if you can say its a fantastic buy because you could definitely be argue we'd be better off if we signed a midfielder in place of him that summer.

165~~~
He is the best striker we have and no Rooney isn't better. He also tracks back and defends well too. He is getting along but if he can stay injury free, he should start scoring like the first season.

Last season, Moyes clearly fcuked him and the rest of the team over. Yes Rooney is captain now, but that just means he should be the best team player because I doubt he will score more than Robin will if both play consistently and injury free.

Yes Welbeck deserves a chance but I would prefer a firing Van Persie any day.

166~~~
This.

167~~~
Without him City would have won the league 3 seasons in a row.

He was worth it on that alone.

168~~~
I'm not saying he was a waste of money, because he did win us the title. What I'm saying is would we be better off at the time if we bought a top midfielder instead of him and made Kagawa a #10 behind Rooney full time? Think our whole team would be better off and we wouldn't be in the state we are now. Signing van Persie won us the title that season, but sir Alex then retired and it then fecked us over having him, Rooney, Kagawa and now mata as well.

169~~~
That is like saying that we shouldn't have bought Mata so we could have Rooney up front with RvP and Kagawa behind as number 10. i.e. the formation LvG is trying out. 

I still believe Rooney was on the way out of a Sir Alex side and think the bigwigs decided to cash in on Rooney instead and asked Sir Alex to retire. And I believe RvP was brought in to either replace Rooney or to bring him back in line. Well Rooney got a 300 000 pound raise and still was rather mediocre last season even if he was our best player.

170~~~
I'm not sure if he is better then Rooney to be honest. Between 2011-2013 yes, but other then that in his whole career, he hasn't been. Actually I think 2011 was the first time Van Persie ever outscored Rooney in a season (Rooney had the contract issues and the awful first half that year) and it was 22-16 in Van Persie's favour, the next year both had great years, RVP getting 37 and Rooney 34 (in 5 less appearances), and then Van Persie's first season at united he was obviously class all year and Rooney had an iffy year. Other then that though, Rooney has always outscored him and has hardly ever been the main striker for us. 

Van Persie though I think just isn't as good as he was anymore, be it because of the injuries or just a natural small regression because of the age (he is 31 now after all). We'll see how he does this season, but he was pretty shite in the world cup bar the first game against Spain.

171~~~
Sir Alex's plan was to offload Rooney, play RvP as a center forward and Kagawa as the #10. He'd never have been in for Mata.

172~~~
But if we didn't sign him, he would have gone to City. Really can't predict these things, but I get where you're coming from.

173~~~
No we shouldn't have bought Mata either, though if we had a competent manager I doubt they would spend 37m on a player who wasn't needed at all. Great to have him but we slightly improved the strongest position in the team when every other position had weaknesses. 

I agree though, I do think Fergie after he bought RVP and couldn't really get them to play that well together, decided to get rid of Rooney and play Kagawa behind him instead of behind Rooney like he originally planned before he realized RvP was a realistic target. He then retired though so couldn't do it.

174~~~
He might have gone to Juventus who were strongly in for him at the time too. But then again, yeah you can't predict these things and it is all hindsight. If Fergie was 10-15 years younger and didn't feel he'd retire soon I'm not sure if he would have signed him though.

175~~~
If I remember correctly, Van Persie was injured a lot of the Arsenal seasons predating 2011. I seem to remember Arsenal fans complaining about all his injuries throughout his time with them except the final two.

Rooney became our striker of choice when Ronaldo left until RvP arrived.

176~~~
Yeah it obviously plays a part, but if you take into account Rooney time at United and Van Persie's whole career (gives similar appearance numbers and using Rooney at 16 in the premier league isn't exactly a fair measure...), their scoring records are almost identical, Rooney with 217 goals in 443 games and Van Persie with 202 goals in 431 games. Van Persie moved to

177~~~
BS you just made half of that up to suit your argument. How does buying the best striker in the premier league imbalance the squad lol? Welbeck and Hernandez were and still are nowhere near RVP's level anway so that's a stupid point to make anyway. 

Apparently "Fergie ripped up any chance to build a squad that summer"? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Erm what? 

Kagawa got plenty of playing time in that 2012/13 season, every time he played in the hole even under Moyes, he's looked far from convincing anyway. Rooney was far more effective through the middle so Kagawa was best utilized on the left anyway.

Van Persie was a brilliant signing.

178~~~
To be honest, I don't remember Rooney having a sterling world cup either. I believe RvP outscored him. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

179~~~
That point was just individually on Van Persie and my hopes that he'd get back to his best with Van Gaal, he still just looked out of sorts sort of. You can't read much into World Cups though. I hope Van Gaal gets the best out of him and brings him back to his form between 2011-2013, if anyone can, it'd be him.

180~~~
Yep, I certainly hope so. RvP announced on FB that he hopes to start the weekend.

*edit* oh wait, he said looking forward to the sunday.

Which I hope it means he is starting.

181~~~
What part did I make up? The part that Kagawa played a large part of that season on the wing, as did Welbeck (loads of times as just a sub), or Hernandez only being a sub or playing when others got injured? I'm not saying they are as good as RVP by any stretch anyways, I said he did screw them over a bit by signing Van Persie when both had very promising years in the 2 years prior and formed good partnerships with Rooney. 

Also, it doesn't matter how good he was, you look at the quality you have at the club already. Rooney had just come off the back of a season where he scored 34 goals, Welbeck had his first season at United as a first team player and was getting better, and Hernandez was an excellent 3rd choice. We had a shite midfield at the time (Carrick was good but nowhere near his 2012/13 form the year before), our wingers to be fair were in good form the year before but Fergie clearly wanted to strengthen and was chasing Hazard and Lucas Moura but eventually backed out of both because agent fees. After signing Kagawa, he obviously planned to sign a winger to go on the other side of Valencia/Nani (both excellent at the time remember), and use Kagawa behind Rooney. That's what I mean by his plans to build a new United team. Then Van Persie became available and he pretty much scrapped all that and just signed him despite him being 29 at the time. It's just short sighted thinking. He was the best striker in the league then, yes, but not too far ahead of Rooney to be honest. 

In the end, yes Van Persie won us the title that year, but there are certainly very valid arguments to be made that it came at the cost of the futures of a few different players here at United already and Fergie more resorted to just effective football to win one last title, rather then get a good style of play going.

182~~~
I don't think hes got his 2012 form left in him. If he does we could potentially sneak in a top 4 finish. We're really gonna need him at his mercurial best this season.

183~~~
Some of those goals go some way to explaining Valencia hitting the markers legs when trying to cross.

edit: Ooooooooooooof, that volley vs Villa.. Definitely worth the fee alone.

184~~~
Can't wait for him to return to full fitness. We need his hold up play and technical skill badly.

185~~~
It was good plan. And would have got rid of all the unbalanced issues we have in our attack currently. Rvp up top, Kagawa as a 10, with Welbeck and Hernandez both lined up as Rvp's successor in a couple of years time, and being cover for the striker position. Januzaj would probably have been Kagawa's cover and would also have gotten a few games in the front four as well. It was exactly the kind of team building and planning Ferguson was very good at.

186~~~
He should start, imo. Will give the other players a morale boost to have him back.

187~~~
This video has just renewed my faith that we could reach the top 4 with some extra strength in other areas.  He just scores from even mediocre chances, and surely teaming up with Mata with a manager who knows how to utilize them both we're gonna see more goals.

There's also a couple of excellent assists from Rooney in there, which again, renews some faith in our attack.

188~~~
Jones looks like Brienne of Tarth there.

189~~~
<a class="username" data-user="61592, @bosnian_red" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/61592/">@bosnian_red</a>
I see where you're coming from re RVP's effect on the team. Its a good point but you can look at any transfer like that.

190~~~
If Moyes & Woody had the balls, he'd have told Chelsea to up their offer to 35M and sold him when he demanded a transfer last season. That's one issue I think Sir. Alex could have put an end to before his retirement.

191~~~
LVG just said Robin is ready to play to MUTV.

192~~~
Robin is ready to play - LVG (MUTV)

193~~~
Good stuff. One positive after the Herrera news. Maybe he can come up a piece of brilliance or two to get us over the line on Sunday. Probably depends on how fit he is.

194~~~
Sky sports have just shown that we had a better win rate without Van Persie last season. However, these stats can always be misleading as the games we won were most likely the 'easier' games on paper, although we lost to the likes of West Brom, Newcastle, Stoke, etc.

195~~~
Indeed. We will compete for trophies this season & if we do, i'd be shocked if it were not because of Van Persie. I feel he'll be renewed & reinvigorated under Van Gaal, other people don't seem so hopeful but I think he's going to smash the league this year.



Indeed. People seem to have very short memories - the guy is undoubtedly class. There are so many brilliant goals in there (Wigan away, WBA, West Ham away, Fulham, Arsenal away, Stoke & his 2nd + 3rd vs Villa). Hope he has an even better season this time, he has it in him.

196~~~
I've changed my mind, he's starting to look old, done some great Hernandez impressions by persistently being offside when I've watched him in his last 6-7 games.

197~~~
Just don't think he's as good as he once was. Injuries took their toll. You can't use the not looking fit excuse forever.

198~~~
Everyone in our team looks old.

199~~~
He was OK I thought, especially for his first game.

200~~~
He's not going to age well here.

201~~~
We should probably wait until he's played for more than 60 minutes before we say we're using an excuse forever.

202~~~
Yeah but I'm saying people used it all last season and in the world cup where he had 1 good performance. He just hasn't looked the same since we won the title, and he gave 110% that season to make sure he won the premier league, which was his ultimate goal. Is he lacking that motivation now that he had that year to bring the extra quality out of him? It's a possibility I think.

203~~~
He's lacking a run of games. If he gets it and is still playing poorly then fair enough. I'd be surprised if that was the case though.

204~~~
Still looked more dangerous than Rooney

205~~~
People saw van Gaal coming and Moyes leaving, and many predicted (on the thread) that he'd score 25 goals plus. I just think we've seen the best of him. We'll still see moments of magic and he'll still win us games on his own occasionally, because he's gifted.

But I don't expect the van Persie of two years ago, personally - for a number of reasons. Not even with van Gaal here.

206~~~
This formation doesn't suit him fully.

It was a cheech like performance.

207~~~
Agree. Too slow and ponderous. It's to cautious which limits his service, and with Mata dropping so deep due to our poor CMs there is nothing.

He looked very isolated and poor in the WC too bar the opening game.

208~~~
It was his first game since the break. So he has an excuse. Just hope he finds top form soon and gets some good balls

209~~~
Really poor decision from van Gaal to select him IMO. Clearly isn't anywhere near full fitness even if he is past his best and he shouldn't have started ahead of Welbeck and Januzaj.

210~~~
I am not worried about him, his technique is just too good to keep him down for long. In the WC neither Sneijder nor Robben passed him the ball enough despite his numerous runs. Just provide RVP with the ball around the box and he will score.

211~~~
We've pretty much forced him today, haven't we ?

212~~~
I'm a little bit worried about him. He has the excuse of it being his first game back so I am willing to give him a chance. He just seemed disinterested and sooo slow a few times.

213~~~

214~~~
Not ready.

215~~~
Yes he's looked really rusty. Him and Rooney haven't linked up at all. His only good moment was when he controlled Di Maria's pass and Heaton pulled off a great save.

216~~~
Woefully out of form.

217~~~
If he scored that chance things may have been different. Quality save mind.

218~~~
He looked sharp at the beggining but turned into crap soon. Welbeck should be on at half time.

219~~~
Looks weak, slow and woefully out of form.

220~~~
His touch and control after that Di Maria pass were brilliant, excellent finish too.

Aside from that he didn't look sharp. Still he and Di Maria were the only ones looking dangerious and Robin actually managed to get a few attempts on target. Which is more than a fully fit Mata and Rooney managed in 70 minutes of play.

221~~~
Is he physically done?

222~~~
Agreed

223~~~
There is no partnership.

224~~~
Well he's back in training for what, 3 weeks now? Still was more of a goal threat than Mata and Rooney who had the whole USA tour and all. So no, I don't think so, but that's just me.

225~~~
This current Van Persie of the World Cup/start of this season is almost unrecognisable from the one I remember during his first season here (I fortunately missed most of last season due to living in an unfriendly timezone). Doesn't seem to get involved with link up play much at all, makes runs too early to compensate for being much slower and very indecisive when he finally gets the ball. Would much rather Welbeck got a run in the team ahead of either Van Persie or Rooney, and seeing as Rooney's the captain it would have to be for Van Persie.

226~~~
He looked dangerous to me. I was actually upset when he came off, I thought he was our only real goal threat.

227~~~
True. He was okay today.

228~~~
He looked good compared to Rooney. He did admittedly have one or two half decent chances. He is just sooo static for the majority though; and lazy. He has been offside a lot lately in completely un-necessary situations.

229~~~
He looks jaded to me. He needed more rest after the WC than we've given him.

230~~~
Useless today.  Needs fitness and desire.

231~~~
Looks out of ideas like all our players. His touch escaped him at times but wasn't really given much to work with today. I don't think he's fully fit, I think Welbeck needs a run or even Wilson. Fresh ideas needed.

232~~~
He looks so slow and cumbersome. He has no burst that he had before. Maybe it'll come as he gets fitter.

233~~~
Watching City vs Stoke, Aguero is soo much better than both of our supposed Worldclass Strikers(Rooney and RVp). He has soo much pace and power which allows him to go past opponents, and his touch is soo assured compared to these two. I would gladly trade him with any of these two.

234~~~

Knee operation delayed last season according to the mirror.

235~~~
Saw this as well. Not surprising. His fee was re-paid when we won the league in his first season. Hope Robin can get back to close to that level again.

236~~~
Yes, it's the #2 most clicked article in a top 5 where this little piece of brilliant journalism is #1:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-winger-adnan-januzaj-4136000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-winger-adnan-januzaj-4136000</a>

FWIW I don't really see why we would be playing him now if he has to have surgery, with Adnan, Welbeck, Chicha, Di Maria all being able to play. You'd say if it is necessary to have  surgery immediately, he would've gotten it already after the World Cup.

RVP went to see an orthopaedic <b>surgeon </b>in Holland to recover, same dude also fixed Zlatan and all, conveniently also reported in the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-uniteds-robin-van-persie-3272341" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-uniteds-robin-van-persie-3272341</a>

Pretty sure they know what they are/were doing, but it's just a better story to imply that LvG is caught in an 'ironic situation' or something.

237~~~
This is shocking if true. Why wasn't he operated on during pre season?

Physically he just never looked right since returning from injury. Looks weaker and slower. Struggles to hold up the ball, movement is limited.

238~~~
He appears to be in terrible form at the moment, but then you see him controlling the long pass from Di Maria yesterday and was only denied a goal by a good save. Then you realise it is only fine margins and a goal and 1:0 win yesterday would have fans saying he is <i>back</i>!

239~~~
I always say this to my Dad. In football there are such fine margins between woefulness and brilliance. 

I personally think we need RvP to be our centre forward with Rooney and Mata just in behind, making supporting runs in beyond at times. I just think the two striker thing isn't working.

240~~~
There are usually multiple ways of handling the same problem all with different costs in terms of initial time out and benefits in terms of recovery. At RvP's age it gets even more delicate a balance because recovery times after surgery tend to be longer.

In other words, if it is true that surgery was advised (and The Mirror didn't discover that information in this morning's random rumour generator) I bet another doctor recommended a more conservative approach and a third one said to start off with rest and rehab, and go to surgery only if it doesn't work.

241~~~
Our centre forwards are getting the worst service to them in years. Long balls knock downs and crosses from 40 yards out. If we make chances for this guy he will take more than most.

242~~~
Feeding on scraps - but are clearly unfit and not at his game. Should have buried the first half chance. And isn't really getting around the pitch. Looked knackered in the second half.

243~~~
Has he been called up to the Netherlands squad?

244~~~
We shouldn't write him off just yet, once we get better service to him and Rooney I'm sure we will see the goals coming in.

245~~~
When the team isn't playing well, he's not the best player to have on the pitch. He thrives on good support, and right now he's not getting it. He was slipped in one or twice by Di Maria and Rooney yesterday - but he just doesn't look as if he can take the game by the scruff of the neck and pull something out of the bag at the moment.

I hope we drop him for the next game. The second Rooney is playing dodgy then, he can come in for Rooney. We saw moments of clicking yesterday between them, but on the whole I just can't see them doing it.

246~~~
it is all connected. Attackers clearly lack some sort of service but they need to provide movement to show they are availible. If they cant run and press the opposition then I am afraid they should be benched. They often gave the ball away too. If welbecks on the pitch he can make chances out of nothing. Often put defenders under pressure and wins the ball in final third which means we are capable to set a quick counter. Unlike when we sit back because players up front are too lazy and uncommited to win the ball so we go to attack opposition from deep thus often opposition defense is set and we have no world class players to break their defense. I dont care if it is van Persie Mata, Rooney or Januzaj, play some hungry players who wants to win who will not be jogging all match with no desire. Bench rooney and Persie.. Mata got injured so I assume it is sorted..

247~~~
Out of all the papers claims on United over this entire summer, I hope the talk of him potentially needing a knee operation is gash.

248~~~
Agreed the movement needs to be better. But I disagree about the pressing. I think they have been instructed to let the opposition have the ball in their half, whilst we get in a compact shape in theory it should allow us to stay solid but it isn't really working yet. 

The two strikers split and defend out wide whilst Mata comes into the middle and defends centrally. 

I think it's unfair to judge the strikers when we haven't had our first choice midfield play one game yet.

249~~~
Is it true that RVP needs a knee operation?

250~~~
Blessing in disguise if it is true. With him out, Welbeck or Januzaj would add the pace and dynamic movement needed to our attack...but, then again our system does not look to be working in the bpl.

251~~~
If it is true, they should do it now while we have a 2 week break.

252~~~
Careful. The last time some ppl on here claimed that - after he had just saved us from total embarrassement with a hattrick against Olympiacos - our season turned from bad to worse!

253~~~
We have Di Maria now and the extra pace and work ethic upfront will only be beneficial and complement a natural finisher in Rooney and a playmaker in Mata. I doubt I would have to be concerned about that. In fact, i am willing to put a wager that we will perform better.

254~~~
Time will tell. It's not like Rooney or Mata are in the form of their life right now.

255~~~
Rooney and Mata will look better with runners, players who can draw defenders by their movement and players who are willing to work hard upfront. Characteristic van Persie does not have. Although, Van Persie will also look better if played with such players, so it is not a case of doubting his quality, but finding the right balance in our first eleven.

256~~~
Precisely.

257~~~
But then again if van Persie got fit after a run of games then we'd have one of the best strikers in the world up top...

258~~~
He would not look like that if playing alongside other static players and passive midfielders.

259~~~
If true, why didn't he do it straight after the world cup?

260~~~
If he needs a knee op, please Van Gaal, keep Welbeck and play him up front. If he fails with RVP out then fair enough, do what you want with him in January/next summer. I know he is capable.

261~~~
We better not lose 2 strikers to loan and one more to injury.

if we keep Welbeck then I am fine.

262~~~
As much as it'd suck to lose him for a knee op, could be a blessing in disguise if we could revert to 4-3-3 with Rooney upfront and Di Maria, Adnan on the wings. It'd buy Van Gaal some time to make an inevitably tough decision between Rooney, RvP and Mata.

263~~~
where are people getting all this knee op stuff from out of interest, haven't seen it anywhere.

264~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-uniteds-robin-van-persie-4136086" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-uniteds-robin-van-persie-4136086</a>

265~~~
cheers

266~~~
What's this about a knee operation then? Has this been confirmed by anyone or just rumours?

267~~~
If he needed knee ligament surgery, he didn't look like he did in the WC, also if it was the case, do you not think he would have had it done straight after the WC, particularly as LVG was going to be the new manager of Manchester United.

268~~~
He faded pretty badly in the WC after the group stages I thought. He still didn't look 100%.

269~~~
Not good news.

270~~~
If it's true that RvP needs an operation from the pre World cup injury, then heads need to roll. Why did they delay the operation until later, when he could have had it after the World cup or his holiday and be on the mend right now.

271~~~
So what date is the operation?

Fairly obvious now.

272~~~
The falcao deal makes me feel that the rumors about rvp needing an operation are true.

273~~~
As great as his first season was, it was always likely to end this way. Well, apart from the bit where we replace him with Falcao.

274~~~
Have the Arsenal rumours started yet?

275~~~
This...

Where is this coming from?

276~~~
He had a really good game there. It wasn't a one man show though, I guess most people are just seeing that we need a shake up, I think Falcao will provide that. Whether or not we need to see a striker injured for Falcao to really get his shot and <i>compete </i>for the starting positions I don't know. I would definitely like to see what could happen with him leading the line with Rooney behind though. With RVP out he should see a run of games, no rotation.

277~~~
So what's the deal with him? For various reasons I cant see Wayne being dropped so it means RvP is on the bench or really out for a long time

278~~~
He's not looked fit for a while imo. Didn't look very fit through the World Cup so needing surgery wouldn't be a surprise. For us to jump on Falcao like this means imo that it's a true.

279~~~
Most likely and would explain his below par performances recently

280~~~
Well, although Van Persie's knee operation hasn't been confirmed, the Falcao loan signing suggests to me that there must be some truth behind it. He could possibly be out for 2-3 months.

281~~~
so if this is true why not have the op right after the WC ?

282~~~
He hasn't looked fit at all since he's returned. He's clearly in need of this surgery if he says "he's been in constant pain for 6 years" or something along those lines. That's not healthy isn't it?

283~~~
It's possible that they only made a decision about surgery after seeing how he coped with pre-season and our first few competitive games.

284~~~
With Hernandez gone, and possibly Welbeck to follow, is it unrealistic to say Falcao would come in anyway regardless of the rumours about RvP?

Is he in the Dutch squad? If so I find it hard to believe he is injured.

285~~~
Most pro players are rarely pain free. Edgar Davids said he didn't play a game where he wasn't pain free. Its envitable that you'll always carry knocks with you when you play week in week out and train 3 times a week with no real time for full recovery.

286~~~
I love RVP's play when he's at his best, but for my own sanity (and to cling on to my belief in the club's sanity) I almost hope he does have fitness issues, otherwise nothing bloody makes sense anymore!

287~~~
I hope it's not true, if it is, why are reports of surgery only just coming out now? How do reporters know anyway? They are just guessing in my opinion.

I think United signing Falcao, is for 3 reasons.

1) Not strengthening our rivals
2) Losing both Welbeck and Hernandez, we need someone else.
3) If a world class player is available, you get them (like we did with Di Maria/Mata).

288~~~
Well, I've always had the impression that Van Gaal will use Januzaj up top, leaving us with Rooney, Van Persie, Januzaj and Wilson as back up. Now that we've got Falcao, I struggle to see where Januzaj will fit in.

289~~~
I think Januzaj is much better out wide.

It all depends what LVG decides is our formation now. I am hoping we go more 4-3-3 when we get our players back.

290~~~
There's enough room for Van Persie considering we play with an attacking midfielder and two strikers. 

Three of Mata/Rooney/Van Persie/Falcao can play at any one time so there is more than enough room for rotation there. It'll be best for Welbeck to go out on loan though, because he'll definitely struggle for minutes as will potentially Januzaj.

291~~~
Or we could bin the 3-5-2 and play a 4-2-2-2 with Falcao and one of Rooney/RVP ahead of Di Maria and Mata/Januzaj. We now have too much attacking talent to justify playing the extra defender, which effectively what we would e doing in a 3-5-2, we need an extra creative outlet and I think City's formation allows us to play our most dangerous team.

292~~~
I think if we ditch the 3-5-2, which I don't expect us to do straight away, then we would just push one of the centre backs 10 yards forward and play with a defensive midfielder instead - so Carrick or Blind in a diamond formation.

The basic style would be similar to a 3-5-2 and most of the players wouldn't change their positions, but it would no doubt be easier for the defenders who really are struggling to adapt to a three man backline.

293~~~
Yeah I agree with that, a diamond is also a great option to try out as it allow Di Maria to flourish in a hybrid CM/winger role that he fashioned out for himself at Real and Herrera wouldn't be too shabby as a RCM . Both Di Maria and Herrera are excellent in pressing which would enable them to protect Blind. The key though is that the player at the tip of the diamond and the two strikers must not be too static which has been the case with a Mata-Rooney-Van Persie trio.

294~~~
That's the thing, though. I don't think Van Gaal will be moving to a 4-3-3 any time soon, otherwise surely he wouldn't have bought Falcao? I personally think he'll stick with the 352 formation and utilize Adnan either up top - similar to how he played Robben, or behind the forwards, as a attacking midfielder.

295~~~
Any news on whats going on with this supposed knee op?

296~~~
Was he called up for Holland?

297~~~
I don't imagine he will need an OP for us to have let both Welbeck and Hernandez go.

298~~~
Just saw he is in Dutch squad for the Italy friendly, I thought he is going to have a surgery?

299~~~
It will be scheduled more like

300~~~
it is understood that the Holland forward does not require an operation and that he is merely still searching for full fitness following an extended break following the World Cup.

Latest on him apparently... that's by a reporter though

301~~~
Why doesn't he retire from Holland to extend his club career? He is not going to win anything with them anyway. He has done well for them and now needs to take care of his knee.

302~~~
This. Maybe he just one last push for the EURO but he should retired.

303~~~
Not sure he is going to be fit for the Euros with the way he is going. Also good luck beating Germany in the Euros even if he plays in the Euros.

304~~~
Jaysus, if he <i>doesn't</i> need this knee op then I really am worried about what to expect from him from now on.

305~~~
I suspect it will be painful viewing RVP over the next 2 years. Occasional moments of class in amongst rather too much anonymity, rarely getting away from defenders, rarely looking fully fit, his productivity way down on his peak years.

306~~~
Cheers. If this is true now the signing of Falcao makes even less sense

307~~~
Well, we only have Robin & Wayne as strikers other than him, Rooney hasn't played up top properly for a few years either...

308~~~
Not really, we've still resigned to losing Welbeck and Hernandez and Rooney/RVP have been pretty dire up front. We've been missing some power and pace up front and Falcao delivers on that front.

309~~~
So dropping one of them makes sense? You think they'll be okay with that?

310~~~
Why? Sure he's looked well rusty but in terms of preparation he's still in the equivalent of his pre-season.

311~~~
I'd be more worried about ya boy wazza who has a full pre season under his belt yet is still performing like he is on the verge of retirement. Van Persie will be back to his best after a run of games.

312~~~
Chances are they won't all be available for selection.

313~~~
What's the point in that? We have Ashley Young and Valencia starting for us while when all fit one of Mata, Rooney, RvP, Falcao might end up on the bench.

314~~~
I don't think the team, particularly the midfield, is well equipped to carry a front three or front four of Robin, Wayne and Falcao and/or Mata in one team. One preferably two of that quartet must make way in order for us to have balance in the side. Atm it's Robin and Juan that have the weakest claim from a performance perspective but all the same it will be a tough decision for LVG to make.

315~~~
If our squad is mostly fit then Ashley Young and Valencia won't be starting, that's for sure.

316~~~
It's not up to them, I'd never play all 3 unless they have Carrick, Blind and Herrera behind but there is no width, but that's not always a bad thing... it gives us another option, but I suspect only 2 of the 3 will play unless we play the diamond and Rooney puts up with CAM

317~~~
He's back in training for three or four weeks after being rushed to fitness, so he could play a <b>full</b> and extremely intense World Cup. Wtf is the problem with people on here?

I expect great things from RVP and I'm 100% confident that he will deliver. He's not a selfish player/striker at all, and I hope I don't have to post some random youtube video up here to show how good he is at other things than scoring goals, so in that regard I think there would be no problem for him playing together with Falcao and possibly Rooney.

318~~~
I think he was generally poor last season and - Spain game aside - not much cop in the WC either. Looked absolutely miles off the pace in his last couple of games in Brazil. 

I couldn't be certain if this was down to too much football or too little. Hopefully the former and his recent performances are newfound rustiness rather than a continuation of whatever's been going on for the past 12 months or so.

319~~~

320~~~
Okay so that's not true then. I think Van Gaal has realized that Van Persie isn't what he was and is well on his way down as a footballer. Don't think he sees him as first choice this season.

321~~~
Hilarious how people are writing him off. Absolutely ridiculous, his movement is as good as ever but he needs service. Without service he isn't going to score.

322~~~

323~~~
This pretty much confirms we will use the 3-5-2 formation. Rooney will be a midfielder, RVP and Falcao up front. 

I this will be another case of lack of service up front. If we do happen to create chances, then we will score goals. We just need practice crossing one successful ball.

324~~~
He was out of sorts in his last two games, I hope he can come back and prove me wrong but I feel he's on the decline.

325~~~
Rooney in midfield means even more pointless crossfield passes and even more losses of possession. Really hope it doesn't happen.

326~~~
Rvp and Falcao upfront <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
If you told me that the day before we signed RVP I would have laughed in your face.
On paper that is arguably the best strikeforce in world football. Whether it goes swimmingly is another mata.

327~~~
Won't Rooney more likely drop into the no.10 role, where Mata has been largely ineffectual this season?

328~~~
But I've been told Mata is <i>so </i>much better there.

329~~~
I doubt that Van Gaal will have been impressed so far. We'll see though.

330~~~
We have to play 4-3-3. This 3-5-2 nonsense will never get the best out of our strikers. Falcao and RvP are pure strikers. They had their best games and years playing alone as the main man. With them in the team, it is like defending with 9 men. Putting them together wont work just like Rooney with RvP. Even worse with Rooney behind them.

331~~~
Exactly, he had two decent chances against Burnley, very intelligent off the ball. More passes like the one from Di Maria from midfield and he will be back in the goals in no time.

332~~~

333~~~
If that is the case then Mata is on the outs....its between Rooney and Mata for the #10 role.

334~~~
So if Van Persie says he's not injured or having surgery where do they all play?

335~~~
One of them will be dropped, which forces that player to make the most of his sub appearances. Competition is good, as SAF always demonstrated. 

My money is on Van Persie being dropped.

336~~~
They won't all play. Someone will be dropped and have to start fighting for their place. That's a good thing.

337~~~
I don't think he'll be impressed with Rooney there once Rooney struggles to even control the ball. 

In a way it's a little bit of a shame that RvP doesn't need knee surgery. At least there was an excuse as to why he looks so off the last few games. Now it just looks like natural decline.

338~~~
You guys forget that RVP wasn't fully fit and hasn't had a pre season so he's a bit rusty. Wait a couple of more games before you write him off.

339~~~
Old Trafford, until Woody sells them to Arsenal.

340~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

341~~~
Does LVG really believe that a front-three of
works?

To make that work the players would need to actually link up and not just wait for the wing-backs to join the attack and then cross to them.

If RVP is not injured I'm really interested to see how that will work out, 3 potentially world-class strikers.

342~~~
<b>Van Persie warns Falcao</b>





Manchester United striker Robin van Persie has warned new colleague Radamel Falcao that he faces a fight for a starting place.



The Colombia international's £6m loan move to Old Trafford dominated transfer deadline day as Louis van Gaal continued to splash United's cash - but Van Persie was bullish about the prospect of falling down the pecking order.

The Netherlands star, 31, said of the Monaco forward: "I welcome his arrival, he makes us better.

"At a top club you should always go for the best, which also fits my philosophy. Falcao must fight for his place, as I also have to. We must duke with Wayne Rooney and James Wilson to see who is playing."

Initial rumours had suggested 28-year-old Falcao had been signed because Van Persie will be sidelined for a significant portion of the season by knee surgery - but the former Arsenal star has quashed the claims.

Van Persie added: "I am impressed that people can pick up the imagination to invent something like that.

"I do not know where it comes from and can say with my hand on my heart that I won't be in a hospital to have the operation."

Nothing like good competition.

343~~~
Amazes me that so many people seem to be forgetting this man.

Oozes class and a definite starter in our side for me. Glad to hear his knee is fine and he is simply lacking some match fitness after the WC.

344~~~
Agree. Look how he was against Spain – when he gets the service.

345~~~
Is he with the national team? He could use some minutes there to get his fitness back sooner.

346~~~
I think RVP is very effective behind the striker. It's not his best position, but I think he's got a better short game than Rooney.

347~~~
Saw his goals again for us thus far, absolute class. With all the transfers, especially Falcao and Di Maria, i forgot how good he was and still is. If fit and on form, give him the ball in a good position and he bangs them in. I stillt hink he will be back, he is just fantastic.

348~~~
Read a few saying he was real bad for the dutch again today in a different formaiton. Something right now is off about his form totally. Hopefully finds his mojo/confidence back soon.

349~~~
I just don't get the Falcao signing.

350~~~
Wait till he rattles 20 plus for us.

VanPersie should be worried,as Falcao as a leading the line striker is a better player.Dont get me wrong i love the dutchman bur hes gone off the the boil over the last year.Hopefully vanGaal can help him back to the form of 2 years ago.

Im sceptical though,and envisage vanP becoming the one on the bench.

I just hope hes ok with maybe having to readjust to sitting out a lot this year.

If you dont keep moving forward you get left behind as our current catch up year is proving,but its a build with an eye on the team for the next 2 years.

351~~~
The problem there has been that both Rooney and Van Persie are good 'link-up' players, and hence often seem to be getting in the way of each other. As RVP once said:

That seemed to be the precise problem, both of them occupying the same areas (dropping deep when not in possession, in the box in similar areas when in possession). That possibly also explains why they don't pass much to each other.

Theoretically, Falcao should work better with one of these two dropping deep and Falcao on the shoulder of the last defender, providing the best finishing touch.

352~~~
I haven't watched, but I saw they were man down for pretty much entire game.

353~~~
I watched the game. He was pretty terrible. He just looks a shadow of his usual self. You'd think he'd back refreshed after the longish break at the end of summer but it seems to have been almost counter-productive. More rusty than rested.

354~~~
Isn't this his 3 or 4th game while other players have had 6 or so games of pre-season under their belt?

355~~~
Football fans tend to forget what a player can do when he has 2 bad games even after 2 very consistent seasons van Persie had. The one that should be dropped right now is Rooney, he's been one of our worst recent performers. It isn't even a question of not being on form, he's been that bad.

356~~~
All the football geniuses who are writing off RVP, saying we wasn't good last year (while he simply wasn't fit, when he was fit he was excellent like always) should look at his Holland stats and compare them to the strikers who they think are so much better than RVP


RVP stats since august 2012 (when Louis van Gaal took over at Holland).

World Cup Qualifiers: 9 matches 11 goals
World Cup 2014: 7 matches 4 goals
Friendly matches: 12 matches 6 goals

So that's 21 goals in 28 matches, a 0.75 goal ratio. And if you disregard the friendlies where I remember him just strolling around, trying to not get injured it is a very slick 0.9375 goals per game ratio for the World Cup 2014 + World Cup Qualifiers.


Big part of those stats come from last (2013/2014) season. So please don't tell me he's on the decline. He's only 31, as long as he stays fit he is brilliant for at least two more years. The moment him or Rooney pick up a knock or are out of form, we'll be thanking God we have Falcao. It's a win=win=win situation.

357~~~
I dont think people are writing him off,its just we re excited we have a better no 9 in Falcao.

He and Rooney/Mat will have to slug it out who plays in the ss/10 position and this is a good thing to build for next year as it should bring the best out of them all.

The onus will be attitude,Falcaos ability will guarantee him a position of that im certain,vanP is trying to hard and has hit a slump but his attitude with vanGaal at the helm should get him through.Leaving wayne,and we all know thats a knife edge when things arent going his way.But feck it its a great problem to have.

358~~~
Meh, I very much doubt Falcao is better than the RvP we saw in Fergies last year. Not saying he will get back to that level but we all assume hes better when he's yet to play in the league and had a whole season out injured. Let's wait and see.

359~~~
I agree. To me there is no way rooney is better than RVP. I cannot think of any skill in open play where Rooney is better than RVP. The one argument people make in favour of Rooney is his goal scoring record, never mind that it has been inflated by years of playing in the top team in England. Well in 2 of the last 3 years RVP was the prem's top goalscorer and last year he was injured and unfit for a long period of time.
Even internationally, Rooney's number of goals are due to the number of years/ games played and the quality of opposition in the qualifying rounds. we all know his record in the actual big tournaments.
Those in favour of Rooney are just stubborn. I am sure some will speak about his long pass ability when really it is pinging the ball out to the right wing. RVP could probably do it as well but why as a striker would he want to do that?
There really is no comparison between the two, RVP is a class above Rooney.

360~~~
Do you mean "is better" or "will be better"?

361~~~
It's not that Falcao's 'better' necessarily. But his style of player is better suited for the way we should be playing. At least in my opinion.

van Persie has the best control and technique of the set of strikers we have - that's in no doubt, but it's the speed he plays at and the lack of movement. He doesn't release the ball quick enough, he can't stretch teams, which makes him less suited to the lone role. He holds up the ball accurately, but again it slows down the move. Something like what Lukaku did against Arsenal is pretty much out of the question for van Persie.

Falcao is capable of that sort of aggressive, positive hold up play, and he trumps van Persie in all the other areas above, and is one of the few strikers who is just as capable of scoring from nothing and scoring acrobatic goals as van Persie.
Other than set pieces and control (with isn't the be-all and end-all) I don't see why van Persie should start over him.
It would just lead to more disjointed, slow football.

And I don't see van persie as one to really partner anyone. He just doesn't play like a partner. He's not like Berkgamp, with out of this world vision and passing and intelligence in the final third. And he's not the player he was years ago when he played wide for Arsenal, so wide in a 4-3-3 is out of the question.

362~~~
Will be better.

363~~~
Quite a different opinion to me there Speak. Interesting.

I'd say he comes across as a forward who would operate better when he is tasked to occupy the lone striker role....but in a completely different way to Falcao. Even though he's done it for the majority of time he's been with us, he seems a lot more uncomfortable with someone playing off him or next to him. I think the way van Gaal used Robben and van Persie at the WC is the only way you can have RVP in some sort of partnership. In fact he'd probably have been the one banging in the majority  ofgoals if Robben was one of those players who didn't shoot everytime he can (which isn't a bad thing, fair play to him for taking his chances!).

In a 4-3-3 with no Mata or Rooney with a 3 man midfield of Carrick/Blind, Herrera and Di Maria would suit his strengths best, though we would be lacking Di Maria's guile and pace on the wing.

What we have is three very different forwards. I think Rooney is the most all-round effective player. No matter how bad he plays he guarantees 30 goals and assists a season. Falcao is a predator, his mindset is purely on getting into the best position to score a goal whether it comes from carrying the ball himself and using the runners as decoys, or a classic forward finding pockets of space in the 6 yard box. van Persie is a very quick thinker, one thing he relies on is speed of thought and when he gets that right he is absolutely devastating - but it relies on the passer also seeing that perfect ball. He's never running in behind when it takes 25 passes before someone considers passing forwards. 

The big task for LVG is does he use 1, 2 or 3 of the 3, or which of the 3 does he use to ensure the other 9 or 10 players in the team are performing effectively. I think Rooney is a constant culprit of slowing down play and that naturally makes certain players look poor, particularly midfielders. At the same time, his diagonal pass to Valencia has most pundits in the world brainwashed into thinking Valencia is still great. van Persie can play within himself, and whilst he has excellent technique, his work really should be limited to within 25 yards of goal, because that is where he is best placed. Falcao will contribute even less to the build up play than van Persie, but if it stops Wayne Rooney from slowing down play then I'm all for it. 

It's quite intriguing to see what we do with the 3 forwards. Question marks over all 3 for completely different reasons, yet on their day they are all absolutely class acts.

364~~~
I suspect for the next 2-3 matches, once Falcao is match-fit, RVP will start on the bench.

365~~~
There is no better strikers than van persie when in form. However he didn´t show anything last year and this year he has been shite. Would rather have kept Welbeck and gotten rid of RVP.

366~~~
I agree with this bit in bold actually. He's a lone striker. And I didn't think Robben and him worked that well as a partnership. They'd have been better off with someone with a bit more movement and pace, to bounce of Robben, to come short and interchange at times, and to create space for him at other times. 

He's a lone striker which is fine. But it's the type of lone striker that creates the problems. Unless you have speed merchants on either side, van Persie is likely to slow things down to much for my liking. And the lack of energy and movement jsut makes us predictable and slow. It makes it harder to create good angles and open teams up. 

You mention it taking 25 passes to get to him, but I actually think he contributes to that. He's very much become a player who only wants it into feet, which alters how the team can play and where the passes can go. 
It's not as bad when he's up top on his own and has a bit more space, but Falcao has the ability to turn and run with the ball on the break, as well as good snappy hold up play. 

I actually think Rooney is very energetic, quick and snappy on the ball, when given a similar partner (Kagawa, Welbeck, first season Hernandez) and someone like Falcao - who moves the ball on quickly and gets moving - will potentially be a great partner for him, and see him raise his game and stop trying to be too precise and measured. 

Like you said, at least we have options, and it'll be interesting to see what happens. But I think putting van Persie in a partnership with Falcao or Rooney will be no good.

367~~~
I heard they were playing with 10 men which is always difficult. On top form RvP is our best striker and that includes Falcao. How both of them and Rooney will do this season noone knows. RvP hasn't had a pre season, Falcao has come back from an injury. It's Rooney who doesn't have any excuse but is playing like he hasn't had any football for 6 months (well can't really blame him much as we indeed hardly played any football under Moyes).

But once RvP gets his fitness back he will be on a great run again, no doubt. It's only a matter of time (unless he indeed needs a surgery).

368~~~
It's a problem throughout the squad...there aren't many players who seem to complement one another. I've never seen two players who complemented each other more than Ferdinand and Vidic so it's finding the balance in the whole team as well as finding a balance between the proven class players in the forward roles. Get it right at the back and midfield and I think things become a whole lot easier further up. It's fair to say the forwards possibly contribute to some of the uncertainty we see at the back but for me you build your team from the back and the confidence works it's way forward. 

So far this season we've seen our defence as a very unbalanced unit and my own opinion on the effects of that is it's prompted more talented players such as Mata and Rooney to be a bit too safe when they get it. Hopefully Rojo, Shaw and Rafael returning can add some balance to the back and steady things up for us and get players like Mata, Rooney and RVP feeling a bit more relaxed.

369~~~
Watched him closeley tonight, and he was able to go full throttle for the full 90 minutes. Good to see, because in Brasil he seemed exhausted after 70 minutes in most matches.

Really don't see why people are writing him off except for the fact that they are a bit thick. The way he looked tonight, he will be up and running for us in no time. Unless someone kicks him and he gets injured again.

370~~~
Dafuq, the only thing he did is drop back and bring the ball backwards, just terrible. He lost almost all his duels.

371~~~
No he didn't. And no he didn't. 6/10 or 6.5/10 if you want my match rating, 5 would be unfair and a 7 would be too much. Only made comments about his fitness levels by the way, and I'll bet my life on it he will be up and running for us in no time, but I already said that.

372~~~
I'm a little unsure. Think of that van Persie in the final year for Arsenal and the van Persie in the first year for United. Comparable to any great striker of any generation. Truly devastating. That van Persie seems a million miles away and I'm not expecting him back.

I hope I'm wrong. But I think he's on the decline.

373~~~
Up and running, he should be fit long time by now, he hasnt been injured and is training for like a month, that's not the problem, the problem is his play which is dogshite. He didn't add some individual quality to the team once again, just like vs Italy.

374~~~
Ever since after that first game in the WC he's had almost the same type of performances over and over again.

He's not getting on the ball enough. He stands in the box and is easy to mark because he hardly moves. His hold up play is frankly shocking right now. He looks weaker.

375~~~
That's what I mean. You really understand feck all about football if you honestly believe a 31 year old player who played a World Cup while not being fully fit (scored 4, more than Robben by the way) and had no pre-season 'should be fit long time by now' after four or five weeks of training.

Based on tonights game there was nothing that would suggest he's lost his magic touch and I don't really see how he looked 'weak', since he was never Drogba or anything.

376~~~
A lack of energy, movement and speed.
Nothing new.

377~~~
WTF, you think it costs players 2 months to get fit? Or even more? And I'm saying fit, not in form, after a holiday, you train 5 weeks, already have played matches, his 4th now, still cant expect he is fit? Footballers are spoiled nowadays then...

378~~~
Dude...

I'm outta here before I really get annoyed.

379~~~
Just taking a while getting going, he now has genuine competition for his place at United now, so he either ups his game, or warms the bench, all nice and healthy for us.

Personally reckon he'll be banging them in again soon enough, and be our top scorer this season.

380~~~
Lol at people writing off van Persie. He will be our best striker this season and best player along with di maria. Falcao and Rooney will be cleaning his boots

381~~~
Shouldn't be near the first team in this form.

382~~~
He will not age well from here on in.

383~~~
He will. He never relied on pace and power. All he needs is fitness and sharpness. He will adapt better than most.

384~~~
Interesting watching United In Press discussing him talking about playing until he's 40, and aiming to be involved in Russia 2018 - tbh the look of him recently you could be surprised at that since he's not exactly looked amazing for a while now.

385~~~
Ageing well is one thing; ageing so well that he's still one to build the team around is another.
He's not like Bergkamp - he doesn't have the vision, pass or link-up ability on that level. It's just not his game at all.

He doesn't rely on pace and power, but that doesn't mean that losing pace and power wont still have an effect on his game.

386~~~
Fitness is not something you keep forever either you know. These days he looks fecked after 60 mins of a match, and he hardly runs much anyway. He is class and I expect him to recover but we may have seen the best of him.

387~~~
RVP's problem has always been that he is injury prone. No one before has ever questioned his skill level, as recent as 2012/13 he was one of he best strikers in the world, I for sure am not giving up on him.
Getting Falcao and Rooney being captain makes me think that RVP will start on the bench for the next few games but I don't think it will take long for him to be a consistent starter.

388~~~
I think you need to watch RVP more closely.

389~~~
True this. He peaked. And boy, did he peak hard. He pretty much singlehandedly won us the title, I don't think we'd have gotten anywhere near top 4 that season without van Persie on our side. I don't think you can expect much more of a player. His performances paid off for his transfer fee. And then some. But we have to come to terms that the RvP during 2012/13 is long gone. He's old, he's lost his touch and he shouldn't start ahead of Falcao in any game that matters.

I'm sentimental saying it too. I want to keep singing that Oh Robin van Persie chant forever. Even if he spent all that time in Arsenal, he's as United as they come. A born winner who dominates the opposition. I was in love the second I saw him in a United shirt. But age gets to us all. We owe him a few appearances off the bench, he's done enough for us to deserve that, but he's just too slow, off the pace and not clinical enough anymore to be our first choice striker, especially with Falcao on board.

390~~~
Well of course he peaked. He is fecking 31.

391~~~
Directness has gone.

Languishes with his back to goal when he should be trying to make goalkeepers work.

Form is temp though,,,hopefully.

392~~~
He's not even on Berbatov's level in that regard, let alone Bergkamp's. Great technical ability, but I don't see vision, close link-up or final third passing of that level. Berbatov trumps him on final pass and deft through balls and general link-up. Bergkamp had a better brain for the role.

Some say that van Persie doesn't rely on pace and will turn into a Bergkamp-esque 'walking' second striker, but, despite his technical ability, I just don't see that in him at all.

He'd be capable of producing moments of magic, but doing the overall role properly? Na.

393~~~
His movement is far too predictable these days. The amount of nothing goals he bagged for us and Arsenal through positioning was brilliant, he doesn't seem to have that at the moment. I also agree he has lost a lot of his build up play, just two/three seasons ago he was almost as lethal with his back toward the defender as he was facing them. These are traits that do go with age, and are exmplified through injuries. I hope he pulls through it but I do feel he's on the decline rather fast.

394~~~
I agree with the majority of this. I remember away to Madrid in the 12/13 season he was brilliant with his hold up play and his back to goal. Now he doesn't seem to do it well and loses the ball or gets bullied off it. I hope he's just in bad form and not actually declining badly. We'll just have to wait and see.

395~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Zlatan says hi!

396~~~
Christ! If you think Robin fecking Van Persie doesn't have the vision or the link up play then you haven't watched him enough. If you think he is not an intelligent player, then you have gone mad. Here is a video that shows a snippet of what he is. He is so much more than just a #9, than just a goal scorer. He gets involved in the build up and often drops deep to help the team out. In fact he performs that role much better than Falcao does. I posted a video a in RVP's other thread (maybe last years?) while back that showed just what he does for the team. I can't find it. Maybe <a class="username" data-user="49620, @Damien" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49620/">@Damien</a> can help me find it. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9i5kdksA3Ww?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

397~~~
Whats so funny?

398~~~
I'm not saying he's not intelligent or doesn't have vision - Of course he does.

But I don't believe that it's so so good that when he's slower and even less robust and that needs to become the main part of his game, that he'll play that sort of role that well.
Again, he has great technique and he can pick a nice pass, but even now, when he's looking a bit in decline, his movement is poor, he's barely looking for the short link-up, he's making his own runs, he's not releasing quickly enough. And he's only going to be less mobile in a few years.

There are some players who I could see threading passes, bouncing off others, and dinking through balls with one touch even if they decided to walk all game, and he's just not one of those, for me. I don't even think he looks to link up in that sort of way.
It's usually apparent when a player is like that, and bounces well off others. But he doesn't seem to enjoy/do that well playing with a partner.
He'd need to change his game up quite a bit.

It was always clear that Bergkamp could work well with others; Same for Berbatov (who I bring up, because he often slowed the play down at United and lacked movement too, but had a superior short link-up game and generally had the ability to bounce off people better)
Not so much with van Persie, and I think he may struggle when he no longer has the legs to be scoring the goals himself.

I also think both Berbatov and Bergkamp had a spring to their step that van Persie doesn't - which helps.

We'll have to see, I guess.

399~~~
Lmfao. When RvP is on form there isn't a CF in world football who can match his link up and hold up play in the final third. He has the best touch and control of any striker in Europe

400~~~
I don't deny he has a great touch and control. But having the best touch and control doesn't make you the most suited to a second striker role. There's more to it than that. van Persie's link-up is very good, but it's not of the short and snappy kind that'll make him a Berkgamp-type player as he ages.
I don't think his vision/eye for the final ball is so good that a team could go through him, and I'd also disagree about his link-up being the best in the world.

Again, I've yet to see him strike a great partnership with anyone other the years. He doesn't strike me as a provider or someone who likes getting close up to team-mates and bouncing off them.

I'm not saying that he wont still control the ball better than anyone else, and that he wont contribute anything as he ages, but I don't see him being this crafty link-up guy who demands a key role as he ages.

401~~~
fecking hell, that to me is absolute footballing porn <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

It would be a travesty if this man is done. I honestly don't think there is a striker in the world that I prefer to watch then this guy on form. <span style="font-size: 12px">Aesthetically s</span>peaking, he's just a beautiful beautiful footballer.

402~~~
I agree. Unfortunately I think he might be done <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>. Or declining rapidly. Hope I am wrong though and it's just fitness.

403~~~
Phrasing <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

404~~~
Too early to say much with RvP, too much quality to be written off, once we get going hopefully he will as well.

405~~~
He was pretty poor yesterday.

Just doesn't seem as fluid as he was. Loses most battles with his back to goal as well.

406~~~
Well over the top now and should seek new challanges in China or the USA. Can't see him coming back now, also considering his age and his ability to get injuries form about anything that exists... Poor lad, should have ended it on top...

407~~~
I hope you are being sarcastic.

408~~~
Will someone tell me what that green mark is on the Right upper area of my posts means.

409~~~
When RvP signed, everyone was quick to say Rooney is done at this club and shouldn't be playing etc. Now we sign Falcao and looks like RvP will get the treatment. He's been woeful off late but lets not write his obituaries yet.

410~~~
That you are online... and no, no sarcasm.

411~~~
That the poster is online I think.

412~~~
ffs

Get a grip.

413~~~
Ok. Thanks I was getting a little paranoid, however, I cannot believe you think that RVP is spent. The man has a great first touch can get off a great shot with either foot. There are lot more goals in him.

414~~~
I think one would need the evidence of a whole season to make a judgment. The guy's not back in his rhythm yet - a late start back after the World Cup then the international break straight away.

415~~~
Agreed. It could go either way but why should some think negatively? I expect him to show his class, a precipitous drop in class is unlikely for such a motivated player.

416~~~
I have a grip. He peaked his first season, can't see him peak again, not at his age and injury history.

417~~~
He doesn't have to peak, he only has to score his fair share of goals. If all the strikers do that they will all have done their job.

418~~~
So this is the spirit of "the worlds greatest club"? I thought the standards were higher than "score a few, then we are good". This is not what this club needs now, and I think you know that as well.

419~~~
He still scored 18 goals last season.

Let's wait and see how he does this season before we right him off. Remember, he did not even have a pre-season so it will take him time to get back to full fitness. Him playing for the Dutch is probably a good thing for us right now.

420~~~
Please don't put words in my mouth - if you're going to quote me at least have the courtesy to quote what I actually said.

What I said was "their fair share" - which is entirely different from "a few". Their fair share of what the club needs in order to be successful.

421~~~
So erm, RvP who was an absolute God on here during the 12/13 season, is now past it, crap, useless, etc - meanwhile, Welbeck continues to be remembered as a far far better player than he actually was. Only on the Caf.

422~~~
It seems like his hold up play is completely gone in last 5 or 6 months , and it used to be his strongest attribute. I remember the Real Madrid game and how well he kept the ball with players at his back, involving others into play in the meantime, allowing us to play deep and to attack on break, but now he can't keep the ball with player on his back to save his life. What the feck has happened to him, every time he has the ball he looks like he is playing with fear of injuring himself again. Still early for this season though, just few weeks ago he was on his summer break, but he didn't look any better before the break either, altough he was playing slightly injured during that period, but still...

423~~~
Was never intended as quotation of you, so if you felt that I put words in your mouth i sincerely apologize. However, I still stand by what I said. He is simply not needed anymore, and I think it was clear when Falcao arrived. Also considering the fact that Mata is still here which forces Rooney to play striker, this is of course of I am completely wrong and Mata WANTS to warm the bench...

424~~~
18 goals last season + 4 WC goals. But no, we should sell him to China apparently.

425~~~
The type of service Falcao needs to be a success RVP needs as well. He hasn't had that in nearly 18 months. He's only just turned 31 & until Falcao or di Maria prove otherwise he's still our main man.

426~~~
It's a bit of a mystery and really concerning. Last season you could it down to the whole Moyes effect that made so many good players look terrible. Plus that whole "over-training" thing. Then he goes to the world cup and puts in <i>exactly</i> the same type of performance. Fair enough. Perhaps he's played too much football. Lengthy break after World Cup, reunited with the manager who knows him best and will make sure he gets his preparation spot on. Hey presto, we're a month into the new season and the performances are completely unchanged. 

I still think he's too young to write off. I wonder if this is all part of the aging process for footballers? I'm fairly sure Giggs and Scholes both had a lengthy spell of underwhelming performances around the big three oh, then adapted their game and had an Indian summer for the next few years. Same is true of a lot of footballers, when you think about it. Gerrard and Lampard would be two more examples iirc.

In terms of strikers, didn't Drogba go off the boil for a year or two when he entered his fourth decade? Any other examples anyone can think of?

427~~~
Poor man's Danny Welbeck.

428~~~
I think it's just a fitness issue with van Persie. When he is back fully fit, he will be banging in the goals for us.

429~~~
I can't disagree with anything you've said & the signs aren't great however i'm hopeful that once the team gets better he will too. The Dutch team & ours in the last 18 months haven't been good or suited to him & I find it hard to believe he's part of the problem although I may be wrong. If we start to look a good team again & he looks out of form then I may believe he's gone downhill but I still don't think he has.
We'll just have to wait & see. A bit of competition should bring out the best in him again but it can go both ways.

RE the bit in bold - it's worrying that i'm finding it pretty hard to think of any examples.

430~~~
Ruud? Henry? Shearer?

Genuinely can't remember the path their careers took at the same age.

Sheringham went fairly seamlessly into his thirties but his game didn't need any adaptation to cope with age taking the edge off his physicality.

431~~~
We should probably wait until our team finds form/itself before writing off players for good...

Unless you think we're generally going to stay this crap all season.

432~~~
To be fair, the last page or two was triggered by his last two performances for the Dutch team. Nothing to do with how he's played for United.

433~~~
Ah.

In which case I'll revert to my "early doors" defence.

It's still early-doors lads...

434~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dxGtKw1P_sk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Praising Wilson too, must have made a really good impression to the senior squad.

435~~~
Another player that praises him out of the blue, Mata was the first one I recall. Must say he's getting good references from pretty big names.

436~~~
This is not the same player, he had to be among the best 5 players in the world at that time, just amazing. Kagawa also looked really well in that vid. If we get RVP/Falcao at their best working great together it would be the best partnership ever.

437~~~
I wasn't talking about him keeping up that level of play. But I was referring to the point that he is more involved in build up play and has the vision and the skill to play a cross field ball if he needs to. I don't think age is going to take that away from him.

438~~~
Mad to think People are questioning his ability, in the last few months he's been unfit and still had memorable performances. Hattrick vs Olympiakos and the Spain game.

439~~~
Agreed, still one of the best.

440~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Sep/robin-van-persie-looking-fitter-than-ever-declares-van-gaal.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...oking-fitter-than-ever-declares-van-gaal.aspx</a>

OK, I thought he wasn't fit so he had anexcuse, but let's see how he does from now on.

441~~~
I was kind of hoping we'd find out he wasn't fully fit. The alternative is more worrying.

442~~~
Why don't give this guy a break. He is still a top player and hasn't lost his ability over night. One of his last games for us was hattrick against Olympiacos in CL to get us through.

He just need to find his form and playing in a team who is not yet on top is not helping. I am confident that he will become one of the most important players for us by the end of the season.

443~~~
Yeah, same here, but I was also hoping someone will reveal us that our whole team wasn't fully fit, because van Persie isn't the only one who was playing like he was. Anyway, we'll see him tomorrow, he can't have easier game to come back into form.

444~~~
I've tried explain that before but once the Caf gets something into their head there's no converting them back.

445~~~
Give him a bit better service and he'll still smash them in. He's still got it. Also I think the added competition for starting places will spur him on imo.

446~~~
Exactly. I can imagine it is not easy to play the striker role when the rest of the team has been playing shite for a long time.

447~~~
You know what's more frightening, that match and in the world cup vs Spain are like the only two matches he has played really good/excellent in the past half year.

448~~~
Lots of great players have bad world cups, Rooney is a fine example of that or both Ronaldo and Messi failed the score in South Africa. As for last years club football he scored 12 goals in 18 starts and 4 goals in 6 UCL starts,  that's no where near a bad record.  Not to mention he was plagued with injuries, was in the worst United season in the PL era and he had the likes of Cleverly, Young and Valencia supplying him.


Change the manager and those players with Di Maria, Januzaj and Herrera you'll see the best of RVP again. As for injuries it was often said that Moyes training was too tough so that could've been a problem with RVP's injuries not to mention he probably raced him back as soon as possible because we were losing so often.

449~~~
He contributes to the shite play.

450~~~
Big fan of him, but he needs to be dropped for a while. He is playing worse than Rooney.

451~~~
If he had the pre-season Rooney had, he would be fine by now.

452~~~
RVP is still a class player but he needs better service and our play has been so poor so far he just hasn't had it. Expect him to start tomorrow with Rooney and mata in the 3-5-2 but how much longer those three will start will be interesting to see, they just dont work together because there isn't enough pace and movement. Wouldn't be suprised to see him start scoring and keep falcao out of the team for a littler while at least.

453~~~
I can't go through another game watching us try to play 3-5-2, especially after the players we've aquired.. We need to get away from it, NOW. :P

454~~~
I know I can't wait to see the back of it either but I think we could be using for at least another few weeks.

455~~~
People probably don't realize that only played 2 games for us this season. The likes of Mata and Rooney played 9-10 each.

456~~~
Still looking poor. Getting worrying now.

457~~~
Has been poor again today so far yes.

458~~~
Yeah he's been really quite again, he better start improving soon else he will find himself on the bench.

459~~~
He's not been poor...just a bit uninvolved which is usual for him. A goal would do him a world of good though

460~~~
He desperately needs a goal I think. If we absolutely tonk these (and I swear to god it's been ages since we've carried on after a good lead and got 5/6/7) and he misses out then he'll get even worse.

461~~~
He's not been great, but there are goals in this game, who knows!

462~~~
He must be dying for an easy goal by now. Something to get him back on the scoresheet again.

463~~~
Nice to see him try to pass to Falcao at the end when he must have been itching for a goal himself

464~~~
I thought he should've taken on the shot.

465~~~
Me too, he'll come good but has to be said he looks off form.

466~~~
He just needs a goal to get on a spell again. He had a period like this with us in Fergies last season.

467~~~
I think he got better as the game went on which is promising. Got involved a lot more. Badly needs a goal I think though.

468~~~
Had a good second half imo. Very involved, looked dangerous

469~~~
Yep. Very good second half.

A goal and he'll be back to his best.

470~~~
I'll count that Januzaj's <i>something</i> as a Robin's goal.

Good goal, mate!

471~~~
He improved as game went on.but I'm thinking he will be the odd man out once Falcao is up and running

472~~~
Yeah, sharp from him today.

473~~~
well off the pace I thought.

474~~~
Thought he looked a lot sharper then he has so far this season.

475~~~
Was anonymous in the first 60 mins or so. Looked much better when Falcao came on.

476~~~
Certainly looks a bit better with his fitness and sharpness, held the ball well, but he's still not at the standard we'd expect. I'd bench him for Falcao next match.

477~~~
He's a brilliant player but I don't see a place for him in this United team.

478~~~
Looked like Falcao was a better partner for him than Rooney was. He looked sharper aswell.

479~~~
Oh come on ffs. If he had put away that pass from di maria in the top corner like we know he can do, then you wouldn't be posting that. Fine margins...

480~~~
Sorry but he needs benching now, he seems to lack effort and desire. He didn't do anything of note in this game.

Falcao to start against Leicester

481~~~
RvP will start scoring soon, mark my words. He's too good not to. World class player.

482~~~
overreaction.

483~~~
I think he is getting back his sharpness and had some clever movement, shame he missed a few chances. I think he will play a less prominent role from here on in but he will also contribute effectively once he gets going.

484~~~
He moved around very well and if he will be doing that and a play around him will be as good as today he will start scoring goals for fun. He was unlucky with his shot after Di Maria pass and the same happened at Burnley. If he would scored that two goals nobody will moan about him. He will score no worry.

485~~~
Get a hold lad. I've been of this opinion since Falcao's arrival. He's the least dynamic forward we have, the oldest, the most susceptible to injury and could potentially serve to the slowing down of our football. Again, he's brilliant, but we have other brilliant players, as well as a captain that will not be dropped and looks a better fit for the system. 

Van Persie will rifle in a scorcher some time soon, I'm fully aware of that, but I'm looking at the bigger picture here.

486~~~
See above. Been saying it all week. Well in.

487~~~
Got better as the game went on and I thought Falcao looked his better strike partner.

He'll get his chances in this set up, four senior players into three positions is the perfect amount to allow for rotation, injuries and changes in form.

488~~~
What would you like me to hold?

489~~~
he missed three big chances stole a goal from herreras feet.. looked better but i can't see why he couldn't be benched and his time should be given to someone like januzaj.. who needs those minutes to gain confidence

490~~~
Still does not mean its not total bollox. The more you say something does not make it true.

491~~~
As much as I like him Falcao should start the next game.

492~~~
Why is it bollocks? I think in Rooney, Falcao and Mata we have a younger, fitter - therefore more reliable - and more balanced attacking trio. Thus, I don't see a place for an albeit brilliant footballer in our best first team going forward.

He'll get chances, he'll most likely play very well when he does play, and he'll certainly score goals, but only a goon would think I was disputing that. A 31 year old that spent the majority of last season injured is certainly the player we should look to be marginalising, if that's what we have to do one of the much-discussed quartet.

493~~~
Much better in the second half on the left striker position. That backpass was one of the selfless moves I saw in recent years, I think every striker in the world would go for a shot there, but instead he opted for a to a man who might bench him.

494~~~
Agreed. I've also said a few times that I don't think he really fits the way we should be looking to play.

495~~~
Why change something that's working? It's not like RVP was bad

496~~~
He wasnt bad but he wasnt particulary good either. 
RVP-Rooney partnership doesnt exactly work.

497~~~
Can't believe he didn't shoot from that chance, he's been in those positions a million times and he always shoots.

498~~~
van Persie in any partnership doesn't work.

499~~~
They weren't playing as an attacking partnership today anyway.

500~~~
One thing that really struck me today was how far apart Van Gaal has them playing. Totally the opposite to Moyes. They were switching a lot and there was always a good 40 yards space between them.  Perhaps a tactic to  make them both effective on the same field.

501~~~
Now we have Falcao and RVP we need more crosses to service these 2 beast of players. RVP will start getting us goals we have to remember this is a new team who have only played 1 game together.

502~~~
They weren't exactly playing as a traditional strike partnership though. And Falcao didn't exactly do much to put himself ahead of RVP

503~~~
He did alright I thought. There's more to come from him.

504~~~
The age brigade out again, I imagine you were one of the mindless fans calling for Giggs to be phased out at 31? He went on to play some of his best football in his early to mid 30's. 
As for RVP based on how rusty Falcao looked today and after his crippling injuries I would be more worried about him. RVP has had nowhere near the severity of injuries that Falcao has. 
If LVG is sensible he will ignore footballing experts such as yourself and rotate the team so they all get roughly the same game time and therefore are fresh for the big tests this season. People seem quick to forget we put 4 past the lowest ranked team in the championship of the 3 that came up.

505~~~
My opinion on Giggs ten years ago has nothing to do with this discussion. But evaluating the age of a squad and looking to marginalise a quality 31 year old with an injury history ahead of a quality 25 year old that does not have an injury history, if that's what needs to be done, is simply sensible squad management. 

I've offered an opinion on Van Persie and attempted to discuss my reasoning. If you're going to rabbit on with that "footballing expert" crack though, then just feck off and don't waste my time with your wanky replies.

506~~~
He looked better and more fresh than his previous two games, which probably is an indication that he will find his form sooner or later. Don't forget that the system is new to him too, once all players have settled in he will start scoring on a regular basis again.

Right now we're a team in transition with many newcomers and a manager who is trying to implement a playing style that is completely different to what these players have been playing over the last years. Imo the most important thing in this phase is commitment from all the players on the pitch and today RvP tried his best to help the team.

So, i believe RvP had a relatively good game. He was continuously swapping positions with Mata (mostly) and Rooney in order to create spaces between the lines, he made some decent deep runs in the box and he always tried to provide options and disturb the defense in the box.

His off the ball movement in the box stretches the defense and creates enough space for Rooney to attempt a shot and score and his involvement in the build up for Mata's goal was excellent. He moved deeper, created space for a run in the box for Mata and chose the right pass to Di Maria. Relax guys, the goals will come... this is RvP we are talking about.

507~~~
Anyway I'd like to see Falcao start vs Leicester, that's all. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

508~~~
He was much better in the second half, so OK, he is improving.

509~~~
Lets not get childish and try and use insults, I am just saying Falcao has had far worse injuries (those that can end careers) than RVP. I would be making sure neither are over used. With regards to age Falcao and RVP are only a few years apart age wise and I would personally judge their respective fitness/injury levels based on scientific facts not age numbers. I assume you know not all players age the same in football, some peak early some have amazing longevity?

510~~~
people and their obsession with Falcao. I dont care who plays, as long as we win i couldnt care less if it is Rooney, Falcao or RvP. People really are obsessed with Mata and Falcao, forgetting what RvP has to offer. Last year, he was undroppable, now after signing Falcao and Mata, they want him dropped. There is a reason why he started in front of Falcao today, Falcao isnt ready yet. RvP played well today, he tried and was a bit unlucky. When he scores one, his confidence will grow.

511~~~
He was ok, particularly in the 2nd half. Defensively he did will now that he had to cover wide in a 4-3-3

512~~~
Definite improvement compared to previous performances, but it was still an pretty sub-standard performance. Definitely looked sharper and came into the game more following Falcao's introduction, but his hold-up play and link-up play just doesn't look consistently anywhere near the level he's set the last three years. I'd persist with him for the Leicester game, as he was better and there's no need to change anything - defence aside - following a near faultless attacking display from the team.

513~~~
I didn't insult you but no worries, apologies for the tense reply. I take your point in regards to Falcao's injury record, but here's hoping. And going forward, with the new man being brought in, I'm going to assume he has a big part to play here. Horrendous form aside, which I'm sure won't be the case, he'll be lining up every week. I think Rooney is in a similar situation. To me, it looks like a straight shootout between Van Persie and Mata if we are to pick a best first XI. Personally, I'd be looking to give that spot to Mata, get him fit and firing, and using Rooney and Falcao's dynamism to exploit defences. 

I haven't really written Van Persie off completely. I've stressed he's a brilliant player, one that will still score a lot of goals here. But I'm trying to look at the bigger picture. The kind of team I would like us to be is a fast one that will terrify defenders. I just don't think Van Persie, particularly when he's partnered with Rooney, is the answer for that future. I've said enough now, people can feel free to simply disagree.

514~~~
Certainly improved in the 2nd half anyway, and was really unselfish with his cut back. If he scored I'd put his performance on the same level as Rooney's today. Both better than previous games, but still a lot of work for them to do. Promising signs. Falcao will probably start the next game though.

515~~~
Even when Rooney dropped back when Falcao came on he did not link up with RVP although the latter's movement off the ball was good.

516~~~
That I agree with - 
Its tough I agree as Mata is great but so is RVP (who had a great WC) I hope we rotate them sensibly and when the big games arrive we pick the in form players. But again the team I would pick V Chelsea for example would not include Mata due to the way they defend and set up. But Vs Arsenal he would be one of the first on the team sheet for me. 

Of course no offense taken or meant, healthy and honest debate makes this forum what it is -

517~~~
He's a moaning bastard if someone doesn't pass to him when he feels they should isn't he ? Very unlikable player.

518~~~
I'm probably being a bit picky, but I'm just watching Herreras goal again and saw RvP screaming for it before Herrera shot and scored. RvP didn't smile in the celebration, quickly hugged him and walked off. He really needs a goal.

519~~~
The RVP from two seasons ago would have finished the delightful ball he got from Di Maria in the second half.

520~~~
You get a feeling that RVP of the 2012/13 season would've banged that volley in from Di Maria's perfect outside-of-the-foot pass. Van Persie just needs to get into his stride again.

521~~~
Sometimes he's also the victim of the expectations his own brilliance has created. His run into the box to hit Di Maria's pass first time was very good, but it leaves him with a very difficult chance. Last match he took pass down with his chest to strike it from a small angle, and shoots wide, "should have scored" said MotD. But if he would have scored them, both would have been absolutely brilliant goals. So he should have scored goals that are brilliant? For most strikers these passes aren't even chances, becaus they're not able to take them like that, so they can't be blamed for not scoring.

He's not on top form, but he's playing all right. His pass to Falcao when he had a decent angle himself says a lot about the kind of teamplayer he is. Falcao has a huge task beating Van Persie for first choice. He's a very good striker, but he's just a striker, not an allround centre forward as Van Persie. And he has also yet to reach the level Van Persie has been playing on for years. Don't forget he's been a big hit in the Europa League, not in het Champions League. Last week the news was he is 30, not 28, but also at 28 he hasn't that much to show for on the highest level. 

With Van Persie's history of injuries and Rooney not indestructable either, my guess is that Van Gaal has chosen three top strikers for two positions, while Rooney could also play as a '10', but he won't be hoping that Falcao needs to replace Van Persie.

522~~~
Still needs to find his full fitness, but I thought he did pretty well today. Really want him to score, though.

523~~~
TBF If it's the Januzaj bit at the end he had all the right to be angry. Adnan should have passed instead of shooting (and missing badly). But I agree he seems a bit frustrated, needs a goal or two.

524~~~
I suspect LVG wants to see if RVP and Falcao can form a great partnership.<i> It was good to see RVP try to pass to Falcao in the</i>

525~~~
in the.....? Did you faint or something as you were typing this post?

526~~~
Obviously not in top form at the moment, but let's hope he stays injury free this season.

We all know how good he is when in form. The prospect of an in-form Van Persie partnering Falcao is just mouthwatering<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DjLzd0vQ8o?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe> Just a reminder <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

527~~~
If Falcao starts the next game, there's no question who sits it out. Sorry Robin but your performances just haven't been good enough.

528~~~
I noticed that as well. But RVP has always been like that, he gave Januzaj a dirty look after he had that shot instead of passing to him. But it's what you expect from a striker to be honest. I admire the way he always wants the ball and has enough confidence in his own ability to want it.

529~~~
What? For years? What, two and a half years, where Falcao's equalled him.
Since coming to Europe in 2009 Falcao's scored 155 goals in 201 games.

530~~~
I'm not writing him off or anything dramatic, I just think he looks out of sorts right now, he seems physically fit but a bit lacking in sharpness and enthusiasm, I also think he looked better with Falcao than with Rooney, I just think him and Rooney often want to occupy to much of the same space.

531~~~
He's had no pre-season, this was his 3rd game since the World Cup.  Couple more games he'll be banging them in again.

532~~~
Much better but he needs that goal to settle him down. He's snatching at everything at the moment...a bit too eager for it.

533~~~
Disappointing yet again. He's a million miles from the player we signed right now and I'm not sure we'll ever see that level consistently again.

The injury rumours made me think that there's an excuse,but to hear he's fully fit is a bit worrying when you see how old he's looking on the pitch.

534~~~
How many goals in the CL? He's a goalscorer, not an allround centre forward, so it's fair to judge him on goals. He's just not proven himself yet like Van Persie, Muller, Lewandowski, Benzema, etc.

535~~~
Needs to up his game and fit into the team if he wants to keep his place. I can see him being dropped but he is still quality and will bounce back

536~~~
3rd game of the season after having no pre-season. There needs to be an icon for knee-jerk.

537~~~
If you sign a player at his peak, don't be remotely surprised if within a couple of seasons, he's looking more like an ordinary player than the star performer he was when he arrived. There is a certain inevitability to what we are seeing, due to his age. 

I thought he played ok today but his total contribution this season is way below the standard you'd hope for from a United forward.

538~~~
He improved in the 2nd half. I am sure LvG wants both him and Falcao match fit therefore both will get enough playing time because he knows what both can do in top form. He won't start all of them every game, but if we really need a goal he most probably wants to bring on an on form and match fit striker, be it RvP or Falcao.

539~~~
He almost played as an inverted winger today, sans the occasional run into the box. Couple that with the fact that he was noticeably sharper, more involved and mobile and the template responses are that much less deserved, although predictable.

540~~~
I thought he did ok today, with the amount of attacking players we have its only to be expected some have quieter games than others some weeks, wouldn't surprise me if next week RVP takes the plaudits

541~~~
Singings of Di Maria and Falcao are just the motivation RVP needed for this final phase of his career.  He will have to perform every game or risk being dropped.  Great position for us to be in!

If only he could have scored that volley today from the Di Maria chip .... would be been a genuine early condenser for goal of the season!

542~~~
THought he was a bit absent from the QPR match.  Didn't play bad, just not involved as much as you would like for a team, especially in the first half, who were full throttle and attacking at every opportunity.  I think that if/when Falcao gets fully fit and sharp, that RVP will be third choice striker.  That being said, he has a lot to offer, and this may well motivate him.  Also, being able to mix and match between RVP, Rooney and Falcao for strikers is a nice problem to have.  They all bring different qualities and attributes to the table.

543~~~
He's looked better each game he's played so far. Just a matter of time before he's at 100%.

544~~~
I hope our only worry after the next few games is RVP not playing to his best. 

What a wonderful season that would be if RVP was the biggest problem in the squad.

The squad is full of attacking talent and they will not all play at their best every match, LVG has the luxury of rotating the forwards or playing them all for parts of the match like today. Personally i'm not concerned about Robin at all...c'mon its RVP!

He will smash a volley past some helpless keeper before to long and then all this silly talk will be forgotten.

545~~~
I thought he was good bar the fact he looked a little off with his finishing. His movement and touch were good.

546~~~
He goes to the bench for Falcao surely ?

547~~~
He was actually good today. Needs a goal

548~~~
Exactly.

549~~~
In my inbox from a new member:
It's a silly argument you're putting forward.
Falcao has proven himself. You say he hasn't matched the level van Persie's been at for years, but van Persie was only at a truly 'top' level for two and a half years, and Falcao absolutely matched it, and against similar teams.

And you under play Falcao's ability to play outside the box. He doesn't dally on the ball and slow things down, but he moves it quickly and moves - which I'd say is better for the type of team we're looking to become.

Comparing to Benzema is silly. Benzema isn't expected to score the majority of his teams goals, and it shows in his play.

550~~~
Wasn't at his best but I thought it was an improvement on his previous appearances this season. Probably helped that the team was dominating though. Hopefully he gets better, still a little concerned though.

551~~~
Proper distribution get the best from him.

Our Robin van Nistelrooy is back. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

552~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.
My internet got cut off. Not sure how that post got sent. Thanks for your concern.

553~~~
Many fail to realise that Van Persie never really starts a season on fire. Only season in his career where he started off very well was in 12/13 but even then he wasn't 100%. He had a slow start in 11/12 which was arguably his best ever season. Same with 10/11 and 09/10. He usually peaks around October/November time almost every single season in his career. From there he either goes on to have a top season or gets injured. Hopefully the former occurs.

He is getting better game by game which is a good sign. If Van Persie is anywhere near as good as he was in 12/13, we will win the league providing our top players stay fit which is quite likely considering the lack of games this season.

554~~~
Had a poor first half, but I thought he was very good the second one. Involved in everything, it looks like he is slowly getting back to his usual standards.

555~~~
I actually thought van Persie was brilliant yesterday. Great movement throughout. Good work rate and willingness to drop deep and get involved.

van Persie was often pulling off into space at the opposite end of play to get on the end of a cross or pass - see Herrera's goal. van Persie was in a 10yard circle of space for about 10 seconds before the ball crossed the line, like Shearer vs Holland all those years ago, just waiting for the extra pass to smash it home.

There's key parts to RVP's role that go unmissed: 
a) it's very similar to the approach LVG used with Holland, softened slightly with options
b) he's an outlet ball, high or low, in approx 9/10 phases of play
c) by pulling off into space, he forces either a full back to mark him and leave space for a midfielder to push into, or a centre back to pull wide and mark him and leave space for another attacker to move into (Rooney, Mata, Falcao etc).

van Persie didn't score yesterday so the headlines won't mention him but I actually thought he was one of our better players.

556~~~
In the world of "those that played the best should play the next game" - RVP should be on the bench against Leicester.

If one of Mata/Rooney/Falcao doesn't play well in that game, he should come back in the week after.

557~~~
If he scored that volley then opinions would certainly be different. He was much better yesterday. Just needs a goal.

558~~~
I know it's bit of stretch but I wonder if motivation is one of his big problems right now judging by his body language last season and this year, considering he came here to win trophies and then suddenly saw Fergie leave and United stuck in a rut.

559~~~
That would imply that Falcao was better than RVP which he really wasn't. I'd also take RVP ahead of Mata

560~~~
Honestly, what game did people watch yesterday? These guy held the ball well, missed a couple of difficult chances, set up a few but failed to score. I think he was good, moved freely and looked hungry. I think you people expect too much from him, it's ridiculous. He's not setting the world alight now but he was not poor yesterday at all. Falcao will have to be eased into the team, none of this new toys syndrome [drop Mata, drop Rooney, drop RVP] etc.

561~~~
Falcao didn't play the full game - so it's far harder to judge, and would be unfair in fact... also Mata was much, much better than RVP yesterday. 

Also, dropping Mata moves Rooney further back, which generally isn't where he plays his bset football.

562~~~
Shame he didn't finish that half volley from Di Maria's pass, or even shoot instead of trying to pass to Falcao/Januzaj. I think he needed a goal yesterday, and he was just unlucky not to get 1. It's difficult playing as a striker with no space behind you like today, but he didn't play awful.

563~~~
Disagree. RVP had a better game than Mata. All that was missing from his play was a goal but the rest of his game was very good. Mata scored a goal but all of Herrera, Di Maria and Rooney looked more likely to create something than he did. Mata was essentialy playing as a 3rd striker at times.

564~~~
He definitely needs a goal. Hopefully he can get one soon. Personally I'd still start him over Falcao next game. I think that starting 11 from yesterday deserve to keep their places.

565~~~
I know the strikers were not given much space due to QPR's defensive mode but I would have liked to see more interplay between the strikers. Things like little one-twos and dummies at the top of the box. I hope the competition between them for a starting role does not make them become selfish.
RVP is constantly moving around the box so it should not be difficult to find him. Rooney tends to pass backwards or pass it out to the right wing then move into the box for a pass or cross. When RVP goes out on the wing he looks to get a one-two into the box rather than cross it. 
It will be interesting to see the amount of passes that occur in the next few matches between RVP, Rooney and Falcao.

566~~~
Nonsense. Sorry, but I really wholeheartedly disagree. RVP was virtually non existent in this game.

567~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Absolute rubbish.

568~~~
Poor first half, decent second half.
Far from his best IMO. 
Such a classy player, will get good again soon...

569~~~
he'll be fine. just need a goal. fitness wise he is getting much better too.

570~~~
He's getting there fitness-wise, you can tell. His movements were better and he took up some great positions. I seem to be in the minority who'd definitely keep him in for at least another game, Falcao did not look fit at all. Keep the same front six.

571~~~
I think RvP got a raw deal yesterday. If you check out his heatmap he spent most of his time centre right.


Unfortunately all action was on the left side yesterday. ADM was at the heart of it all, and Mata and Rooney were attracted to his side of the pitch as a result. Hence he found it much harder to get involved in build up play, and when the ball did come to him in the box, they were difficult chances.

That's not to say he had a great game yesterday or anything, but i think he was partly a victim of our tactics. I'm sure had Rooney been asked to do the duty on the right and he on the left he would have been much more involved.

572~~~
I also think he will be fine after a few more games but the difference in bashing between RVP and Rooney after similar low levels of performance is quite astonishing! No mentions of RVP's wage in here. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

573~~~
I thought he was very unselfish when he rolled the ball into Falcao rather than go for goal himself.

574~~~
I thought RvP was pretty decent yesterday. Best match of his season so far. Even with the NT he was abysmal yet again, like he´s been with Man Utd so far. But his performance yesterday was better. He needs a goal or two to get that feeling again probably. The question is if he´ll get the time. With Falcao in the squad he might not.

575~~~
He played okay, but didn't score and that'll be a problem with the competition for places now.

576~~~
Apparently there are rumors that rvp has been exchanging inappropriate texts with one of the other first team players missus. I stress apparently, as I've only seen it from that Malachians guy on Twitter. According to this theory it may have impacted the decision to make Rooney captain over RVP.

577~~~
Well that escalated quickly.

578~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> time to sell him if true. Benched Mata and now this. Get out.

579~~~
Finally the Dutchman is back

580~~~
Poor finish, lucky deflection, not done much right in truth.

581~~~
Good for him to get off the mark anyway though. Hopefully he'll be able to build on it.

582~~~
If it ended in goal, it's a good finish.

583~~~
Happy for him. Still not 100 % though.

584~~~
Well, that's not true. Kasper would have saved that comfortably without the deflection.

Hopefully he can kick on from here, though.

585~~~
The only striker who's scored and looked like scoring. I'd say he's done enough.

586~~~
What does RvP have to do to not play every minute on the pitch, let alone get dropped for a player in far better scoring form (Mata)?

It's laughable how he's being treated.

587~~~
He did well to get a goal but offered very little after that. His overall game still needs a lot of improvement.

588~~~
Thought he was shit the whole game. Don't think playing him into form is going to work.

589~~~
Mata came on and cost us the 4th goal. Got shoved off the ball far too easily for it too.

590~~~
He was very good and held the ball up well. Not the reason we lost.

591~~~
Was shite the whole game.

592~~~
He's not the reason we lost but he was not too good today. If his touch had been at 1-3, he'd have scored and put us 1-4 ahead and we wouldn't be having any of these discussions.

593~~~
He scored a goal and got an assist. Laughable how he's become the scapegoat.

594~~~
The ball was fired into him at 100 miles per hour by Di Maria ffs

595~~~
It's less about his goal and more about his overall game today, which remains fairly poor. He's not a scapegoat since he's not the only one coming in for some criticism.

596~~~
Played ok today in my opinion, held ball up well but needed more sharpness in the final third and slowed play up far too often.

597~~~
It really wasn't that fast and someone with RvP's exceptional touch should be controlling and scoring that.

598~~~
Honestly disappointed by Van Persie today. Didn't look as dangerous as Falcao despite scoring. I remember Van Persie in 2012/13 driving at players, taking control of the ball, testing the keeper from range, looking fluid, sharp, confident. Even last year against Olympiakos: Holding up the ball, dominating the final third. Today he looked like he did at the latter stages of the World Cup: off the pace.

599~~~
I agree with this, our play comes to a halt when the ball reaches him too often right now, just looks a yard short in general to me.

600~~~
He is lazily offside a lot lately. Noticed it at the World Cup too.

601~~~
Loved RvP at his best but he was poor again today. Starting to wonder if he may be finished at the very highest level.

602~~~
Can he stay onside FFS? He's killing every chance of a comeback with his frequent offsides.

603~~~
I thought he was alright today, but I don't think we can accommodate both RVP and Falcao in the starting XI other than in the easiest of easy fixtures.

604~~~
Not been the same for a while, even during the WC he looked off the boil in a fair few of the games. Not sure why he stayed on & Di Maria came off today. Would rather see Mata start in behind against West Ham with Rooney & Falcao up top.

605~~~
he was the worst player on the pitch, slowing the game down in final third messed up two chances, always offside, very slowly running nto putting pressure on their defenders. He should be on bench at best. But yeah he will play just because van Gaal and Van Persie lick each others balls. I am really furious about him starting. Rooney atleast stepped up his game..

606~~~
Got a goal and thought he would kick on a bit in this game. The others (Falcao, Rooney, Hererra & Di Maria) really link up well together. Not sure if RVP is still finding his feet after the extended break he had, but he does look slower than them, not in terms of pace, I mean.

607~~~
Got a goal and an assist, but poor overall play. Held the ball way too long at times and killed a lot of the momentum going forward.

608~~~
I thought it was just about him getting a goal... but then he got his goal and was still crap, so god knows whats up with him.

609~~~
Tbf, he hasn't had a full preseason, and players like RvP who've had a lot of injuries in the past probably need a good few games to get up to speed. He'll be his old self come October!

610~~~
Correct. His whole game atm is incredibly sluggish and laboured.

He needs to be dropped and fight his way back into the team. Anything less is poor management of the player.

611~~~
Rooney got a lot of the ball, still don't think he's the long term solution in that role.. nor is Mata in my opinion (i'd rather see a Barkley type player with vision, dribbling ability, energy and drive in that role) - nevertheless decent performance, good assist to Di Maria and involved in the game.

Falcao - similar to Javier Hernandez, not involved in build up play at all but good cross and nearly a magical goal.. but absent either side of those moments and won nothing in the air and poor hold up play.

RVP - excellent hold up play today, everytime he received it.. he held on to it and got it off to a team mate. Quite involved in our build up play and more presence than Falcao - easily in my opinion based on today. Negatives - slowing up play, sloppy touches in the box.

If you ask me only one of the three would ideally play as none of them are physically what they once were, but if I had to pick who was worst.. Falcao and then the other two much tougher to call.

612~~~
Slowed the game down too much today, seems to be lacking from confidence. At least he got a goal.

613~~~
That was annoying as feck that, so many times he got it on the edge of the box and just fecked around with it before passing it back to Rojo or someone else out wide.

614~~~
Better than Falcao today

615~~~
Not for me. RVP went missing for large parts of the game, he looks disinterested.

616~~~
His movement for the first hour was excellent. After that he was completely anonymous, aside from doing his best Inzaghi impression by being permanently offside.

617~~~
He was comfortably better.

Understandable that Falcao will need a bit of time though.

618~~~
I wonder what is going on with him? Is it confidence or is he too sure of his position now that Van Gaal is here? 

Destroyed so many moves. Berbatov would have destroyed Leicester with Falcao, Rooney and Di Maria running off him.

619~~~
Assist? Unless you're saying for passing it to Di Maria before Herrera got the flick.

620~~~
For some reason he looks disinterested.

621~~~
Yeah, had a brain fart there.

622~~~
I love RVP but for now our starters have to be Falcao and Rooney with Mata behind them.

623~~~
Great that he scored today, but I really want to see us start a few games without him. I just don't think he fits the team at all.
Slowed it down again today, and barely contested for headers within his reach.

624~~~
He's become a bit of a passenger at the moment - it's funny because based on reputation, we all expected Falcão to be the goal poacher number 9 type of player, always on the shoulder, with RVP dropping back and getting more involved. As it turns out so far at least, Falcão's build-up and hold-up play have been much better than Robin's. Personally, I don't think this is a solution to the "shoehorning RVP, Rooney and Falcão into the same XI" problem; wouldn't mind seeing him dropped for West Ham.

625~~~
If Mata can be dropped after scoring then RVP can also be dropped.

626~~~
Doesn't look arsed half the time

627~~~
Thought both Falcao and RVP had poor games today. Aside from their assist/goal, they were largely invisible, killing the flow of the game with either a poor first touch or touches back towards our own goal or simply being offsides. 

Falcao has the benefit of the doubt, this being his first start for us, but I'm genuinely worried about RVP.

628~~~
Seen this before with Berbatov.

Over the last season (and the world cup) RvP has become a proper 'Rolls Royce' luxury player. It bothered me today that he started over Mata, and it worried me to see LvG trying to shoehorn RvP, Rooney and Falcao into the starting 11.

629~~~
Yeah, none of them had a great game apart from the first goal. Hard to say who was better or worse for me, but I expect more from Robin whereas Falcao just looked plain old rusty at times, which I feel can be explained by being the new guy in a new team and all that. Robin on the other hand should be upping his game with all the competition for his place, but he just looks all sorts of off.

It's hard to find many mitigating factors for him as well. If he for some reason isn't physically fit he should be left out of the side, as we have fantastic options on the bench.

630~~~
I have supreme trust in Van Persie. At the moment he is the scape goat, even after a game where he gets a goal and an assist people are still on his back. It's still early days.

631~~~
He wasn't great today, but he was better then Falcao.

632~~~
Where was this assist? I think you're imaging his contribution is greater than it was, perhaps this is what LvG does also, would explain a lot.

And I don't think he's become a scapegoat - in fact, I blame LvG for starting such an unbalanced 11 rather than RvP. But RvP has been poor for a long time now - including the world cup.

633~~~
Falcao's shot that hit the post... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

634~~~
I hate it when he keeps the ball too long and hesitates to make a decision

635~~~
Playing with 3 Forwards is simply overkill now that the midfield has had a full overhaul with Herrera, Blind and Di Maria.

636~~~
I don't know if it's shoe-horning since Mata isn't that much worse as an individual player. Perhaps LvG just wanted a different dimension on the pitch and hence went for the lineup he chose.

637~~~
He just isn't as sharp or instinctive as he was at his best.

The chance when Di Maria fed him should've been buried. RvP at his best does that.

And he takes forever with his decision making at times, his one and two touch passing and link up are gone.

638~~~
A yard to two short at the moment, also as others have mentioned above, seems disinterested. Maybe not being the main focal point of the team / fans?

Attitude seems to have changed since we went shit, hope it just a hangover from the Moyes era.

639~~~
Di Maria has slotted him in 3 times in 3 games and RVP has missed.

640~~~
Assist? Our assisters were Falcao, Rooney, di Maria.

641~~~
I thought he isnt interested cause of Moyes. Now it seems he isnt interested in general. 

Although he scored he should be dropped for West Ham.

642~~~
Sure he's still interested, but he's just had a major dip in the form, quite a shocking one in fact, could be he will never get back to where he was 2 seasons go, which is sad.

643~~~
He doesn't look sharp, at all, was at the QPR game, was bemused how he played the full 90 when others were being subbed, writing it off to perhaps LvG giving him the minutes to get him fit, yet was equally bemused today how he again was given the full 90 over some others.

644~~~
Lucky goal, lethargic and disinterested. Wasted a few chances and slowed the play down too much. Not a good game for me. Got a feeling it's only going downhill from here, unfortunately.

645~~~
He obviously looks much better alongside Falcao than he does alongside Rooney, but I don't think playing both him and Falcao is the best for the team. Probably one of his best games in a while, but still he wasn't great. If we can't drop Rooney or Falcao, we should drop him because Mata is better player at the moment.

646~~~
It is a dip in form and thats just it. To me it is not a fitness issue. I dont think he looks disinterested either, more low in confidence. He hasnt produced in a long time now for us and he cant have any excuses. Needs to find his class soon.

647~~~
In agreement over the disinterested point, for me.. the last 2-3 games he played in the World Cup, he looked similarly sluggish despite being desperate to go further.
We all hope he can come around again, perhaps he'll never  have another season like that of our last title win but he's surely capeable of giving us much, much more than at present.

648~~~
Can't continue to perform at his current level and keep a place in the team. Especially not when we've got Falcao/Rooney. He should be dropped for the game vs West Ham.

649~~~
You can't ignore the fact that he's spent the majority of a year on the treatment table, played during a World Cup and now into another season and he's gotten older too.

It's not even remotely a stretch to suggest he's too slow now to be the RVP we know he used to be.

650~~~
di Maria has put him in for about three sitters in the past two games and he's wasted all of them. This was a man who 9 times out of 10 would put away half-chances, let alone the easy ones he's been getting thus far. He must be dropped, we simply cannot afford to continue to play him, and Mata must play as the #10. Rooney and Falcao up-top, please.

651~~~
He needs to sit vs WHU. Play Mata in his natural position and put Rooney up front w/Falcao.

Sort it Ferg...ohh wait.

652~~~
Good point but really and truly his best qualites shouldnt be affected that much by it.

653~~~
I don't see how anyone can say he isn't looking sharp. He's the one striker who's been getting chances in every game. The bigger concern has been his link up play. It hasn't been close to the standard he's capable of.

654~~~
Needs to be dropped really. 

He is not adding enough to the team.

655~~~
Exactly but you are confused with the word sharpness here. Hes getting chances but he isnt putting them away. Soccer dictionary for lack of sharpness right there.

656~~~
It is unbelievable that a professional football can have a complete lack of understanding of the offside rule. When we play a long pass towards him, I just put my head down knowing there isn't any point watching as the flag will be up and unfortunately I'm proved right most occasions.

657~~~
Needs a holiday. Or something. A fresh RVP for the run in could be a huge lift.

Rooney has been better this season and all the rooney haters will agree.

658~~~
RVP is too often off-side but I don't think he has been playing as bad as some say. I don't know when it will happen but I really would like to see Mata supplying RVP and Falcao. I do not remember seeing Rooney pass a single ball to RVP in the 2nd half despite the latter's off the ball movement.

659~~~
I thought he was more involved (but still poor). He was too slow with the ball a lot of the time, but at least he was getting it more. I don't think he should be starting though. Not until he finds form.

660~~~
He doesn't have what it takes physically this season.  Compare him with Costa, who may not be as good technically but is a much better striker currently.

661~~~
He was much better today than he has been, onwards and upwards.

662~~~
When he took the ball yesterday he too often looked to be caught flat footed, then took the ball backwards and held onto it too long. 

Ideally you want to see your forwards take a touch and move it on quickly. Particularly with team mates like Falcao, Rooney, Di Maria. Rvp looks down on confidence to me.

663~~~
He is the weak link in our forwards at the moment and I don't like that it is Mata who has been benched instead of him. He is wasting chances, slowing down our play and getting caught offside numerous times. He needs a spell on the bench and needs to show that he deserves to start, at the moment he hasn't done that at all.

664~~~
Falcao was better today. Should be benched until he shows improvement. If Falcao starts knocking them in it could be just the motivational boost he needs to get his game together. Can't blame the delivery forever.

665~~~
Give him all the rest you want and he still won't be that much better in terms of fitness. He is who he is, LVG recently that RVP was good fitness wise but we saw his performance yesterday. It's time to really accept that RVP won't be better than this.

666~~~
I understand that LVG is trying to play him into form. Its going to be a long season and I think RVP will come good. He had a couple of chances yesterday but faded as the match went on. To me that's a sign his fitness and sharpness isn't at the ideal level. The only way to rectify this is to give him match time.

Im encouraged by the fact that he has opened his account and will only get better provided he stays injury free!

667~~~
Its quite normal for players who have had a big world cup to experience a dip in form the next season. That isnt an excuse - there are plenty who played as much football in Brazil doing better than he is now - but it is at least an explanation. He will get better.

668~~~
He was OK today I thought, getting better and I was really happy for him that he scored even if the deflection meant it was slightly lucky. I think he's still a class player.

669~~~
Nah, the Burnley one was a top top save. QPR should have been a goal and today was 50/50 for me. Top form RVP puts it away though.

670~~~
He was poor throughout most of the world and poor for almost the entirety of last season.

Hopefully you're right but there's a trend here that goes beyond your standard post-WC dip.

671~~~
After the group stage of the WC he really was not very good. I think I heard he had an injury or some sort of issue though.

672~~~
How bad is that knee of his? He just looks so laboured.

673~~~
He was ill. Quite badly by all accounts too.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/08/us-soccer-world-ned-vanpersie-idUSKBN0FD25S20140708" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/08/us-soccer-world-ned-vanpersie-idUSKBN0FD25S20140708</a>

674~~~
Ah yes. I thought it was an illness.

675~~~
This is so frustrating. I thought after selling Hernandez, this is something we wouldn't have to worry about but he's been almost as bad. He was offside pretty much whenever he got the ball in those last 15 mins or so.

ADM finds RvP and his runs every match and the latter manages to miss it every time. I'd rather have Rooney up top with Mata behind him. He and Falcao both are more likely to score from their chances than RvP currently is.

676~~~
Surely he will be dropped on Saturday, I can't see how LvG can justify playing him from the start again.

677~~~
Ruud was the exact same.

678~~~
<b><span style="font-size: 15px">Rio Ferdinand Tells MUTV Who Sir Alex Ferguson's Retirement Hurt The Most</span></b>

It doesnt surprise me, RVP and Fergie had a great relationship (remember the hug, cant remember which game) and it was obvious RVP enjoyed his time at United then.

679~~~
His swagger seems to have gone a bit. I thought he'd kick on again this season but it hasn't happened yet for whatever reason. He just doesn't look arsed.

680~~~
Stoke City

681~~~
Thanks. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

682~~~
I think LvG will persist with RvP and try to get him to play into form. An on form RvP is better than Rooney or Falcao for me.

683~~~
And how much more do we have to suffer to get 'on form RvP'? I'd much rather see him dropped and play with players in actual form like Mata, and Rooney who has been better thus far.

684~~~
Thought Van Persie should have been dropped rather than Mata after the QPR game, hope he isn't up there with Rooney as an undroppable player.

685~~~
It' a tough call but he has been poor bar a deflected header...He's carried his knockout round form from the world cup right into Manchester.

686~~~
His movement for the first hour or so of the Leicester game was excellent.

687~~~
Yeah but then? He started his whole offside routine after that - it seems to me his legs are going if not gone. Cannot spring a trap, and never presses just jogs around, just like for Holland recently. He'll still finish chances (though he hasn't done much of that either lately) but it's at the stage where you think he has to stay in the box to be effective. I hope he proves me wrong but this is what he's been showing since late last season, apart from the game vs Spain.

It could be he lacks match fitness but it's taking a rather long time to achieve!

688~~~
Cannot spring a trap? He's done so 2 or 3 times in the last 2 games just never taken the chance either time.

Agree there's an issue with lasting the full 90 but the first hour was reason for promise I think.

689~~~
I was being a bit hyperbolic, but the gist is that 2 years ago he was much fitter and consistent than the past 6-8 months since he returned from his last injury middle of last season.

I think it's safe to say he can't play at this level anymore to a consistent standard, everything he does is laboured and half hearted. Don't know what's happened, age/injuries? but he is shadow of the player he was in our last title winning season. At this stage of his career he would probably benefit from a move to SerieA much like Torres (scored on his first start for AC Milan).

Against west ham if RVP is in the starting 11 and mata is benched again I'll start losing faith in LVG if he continually persists playing him especially when it means mata keeps missing out.

691~~~
Last season he was more prolific under Moyes than Ferguson...

This season has just started.

692~~~
Even with an out of form RvP we aren't exactly struggling in attack at the moment. If that's his strategy it's low risk enough.

693~~~
In terms of goalscoring yes, I agree, but there's more to it than that. The risk is that you simply cannot play three #9's in the modern game. There's no way we have the balance for it, as di Maria and Herrera both aren't really midfielders who like to defend, and are best utilised going forward. Conversely, here's far too much riding on Blind, and even the best DM in the world would struggle in such a case. Aside from defensive balance, it lacks ball rentention and keeping possession, as we are playing Rooney, who is basically a second striker, as the #10. It was an issue in the 50-60th minute mark against Leicester.

694~~~
We definitely have defensive issues, but it's for a reason.  Either the players aren't there or they are injured. There's not even defenders to go with a 3-5-2 anymore, and we didn't look too good doing that to begin with. Take away RvP and put in who? Januzaj? Mata? Carrick is out and the rest aren't good enough so what do you do?

Besides, defensive capabilities and formations were not the real reason we leaked 5 goals. 1, maybe 2 were due to legitimate defensive issues, 1 was Clattenburg and Rafael brain fart, the rest were a result of the team collapsing. Ie. mentality and discipline. If Rafael had been cool enough to not rush into the box there would have been no decision. Dogs routinely get shot doing runs like that at the wrong person. And if the rest of the team hadn't bombed forward like headless chickens, and doing it badly, there wouldn't have been all these counters for Leicester to seal the deal. They took a chance in trying to outscore us and we buckled under the pressure. We could easily have put 2 or 3 past them if the players had kept a bit of cohesion and mental fortitude. And that's what LvG will have to work on until he can replace those who aren't up to the task. I also think a lot of problems will even out once Shaw and Carrick get into it, and also getting Jones and Evans back. It'll be far from perfect, but if LvG has hope in RvP finding old form and scoring vital goals for us it might be worth it. In any case I don't think replacing him would have done much of a difference on Sunday.

695~~~
I agree with some of what you say there, but that's not the point I'm trying to get across. You've missed the point of ball retention and the fact we had an imbalanced front line. With Mata in the side - whilst he doesn't add much defensively - he is able to dictate and control the tempo. At 3-1, or 3-2, that's pivotal. It can bottleneck their pressure and their attacks, slow down the pace, irritate the fans. If we had Mata on the field to have assurance on the ball and keep things  ticking it'd have been a little better.

696~~~
Golden boy better start performing today.

697~~~
He'll probably score one or two today to be fair. But that still won't change that we'll be better off playing a system without him, in my opinion.

Barely ever have we looked cohesive and fluid with him playing. And the few times we've looked really good in the last couple of years have usually been when he's not been on the pitch.

Not the biggest fan of Mata either, but if we're insistent on playing two up top, I'd rather not play van Persie and get Mata in behind Falcao and Rooney instead.

698~~~
Yeah, it's appearing more and more likely every game that he's not a droppable player and it'll do no good for him.

I'd really hoped that the acquisition of Falcao would mean that RvP, Rooney and Falcao would all offer competition to each other, as it was clear that complacency was setting in.

Apparently not...

699~~~
I guess Rooney's not the only one with special privileges.

700~~~
Really needs to start justifying his starting position and Van Gaal's faith in him. He's looked off the pace in all his appearances so far. Mata is one of our in-form players and he has a strong case for inclusion. We can't be waiting for both him and Falcao to find their sharpness. That doesn't send a good message to the rest of the squad. We want fair competition for places in our attack.

701~~~
Has been brill so far. Great taken goal, nice interplay on the right with Herrera as well a couple of times.

702~~~
Great goal but would like to see him hold up the ball better and take the pressure off the midfield/defence. Slowly working his way back to full sharpness and brilliantly taken goal.

703~~~
Great taken goal with an assist from Falcao. Still seemed caught on his heels a few times but 2 in 2 justifies his starting place now.

That said, I still don't think him and Falcao should start every game together. It just makes the team too top heavy and serves no balance.

They're both looking to get into the box, rightly, and we end up surrendering possession more easily in the final third.

704~~~
I suppose that's why he always gets picked, because he guarantees you goals. Great finish by Robin.

705~~~
You can slowly see Van Persie blowing cobwebs being blown off. The way he took the ball down to square to Herrera in the build up to Di Maria's chance showed he's starting to rediscover his self-belief. Still thinks he needs a few more goals to really start having faith in himself again.

706~~~
Page 17 of this thread <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

707~~~
his touch is still off

708~~~
Was that hit 50th goal for us? Definitely one of the fastest players to reach 50 goals for us?

709~~~
Was only half listening, but the commentator on my stream mentioned Ruud was quicker.
Shows how ridiculously good Ruud was

710~~~
Still my favourite United player. 

Just out of curiousity, how do you think his career will be remembered.

Arsenal legend
Great United player who almost singlehandedly won us number 20.
Other

711~~~
He'll win us another league...not single handedly, but he'll play an integral role to it. Don't write him off just yet.

712~~~
Had a good game today. Made the space for Rafael for the first goal, scored the other one, got involved in the play and ran his ass off when he was the only one left in front. Can't ask for more.

713~~~
Couldn't do much on his own against 3-4 players upfront, but I bet there'll be plenty blaming him for not being involved enough. I thought he looked a bit sharper today, got on the scoresheet again... we will see how he does with Falcao/Mata upfront in the next three games. Still think he'll get around 20 league goals this season.

714~~~
Done well today, expect him to take the captaincy for the next three games as surely Fletcher won't start.

715~~~
Remember in 12/13 his all round game only really came to life in October. Before then he was only scoring goals. Same as this season. He will go up another gear soon.

716~~~
He was good, but falcao was better at holding the ball and engaging more defenders. So was surprised to see him taken off rather than RVP..

717~~~
He scored again and all but he's a complete luxury player to carry right now.

Dunno why he wasn't taken off 2nd half really. He barely pressed or touched the ball and didn't hold it up when it came to him either.

718~~~
I thought he was ok but this trident with him, Rooney and Falcao is not ideal IMO and he looked legless by the end, I thought Falcao was better suited to the lone man role. For me at this point I think he's suited to the Teddy Sherringham role in our squad.

719~~~
When we're not dominating the match, he's pretty useless unless he's partnered by someone with pace (Robben) who'll do all the running for the pair.

720~~~
Very good goal and did okay. Think he's still finding his feet again sort of so it'll take him a bit of time but he's still a very good player. Great having 3 clinical players like RvP, rooney and falcao though. We just need falcao to get off the mark now too.

721~~~
Good goal but he doesn't look fully fit to me or something. He's just not playing as well as he can.

722~~~
Beautiful control in the box, then passed it on with his right to Herrera, had some other glimpses of genius too. Very good goal, looked sharp and dangerous, he helped defending when needed too, Probably our best player today after Rafael. Not quite sure what some people are expecting of him, he was as good as he ever was today.

723~~~
Scored a great goal and he held the ball up the best he could. Not bad today.

724~~~
Some people on here are like kids with new toys. Now that we have Falcao and Di Maria and then RVP and Mata become 'luxury players' and should be subbed or benched.

I saw a solid performance from RVP today and a well taken goal. He was far more integrated than Falcao in our overall play, seemed composed on the ball with defenders at his back and fought till the end. There is room for improvement, no doubt about that, but he looks to be on the right way and improved every game he played so far.

725~~~
I don't care what other people say. "Statistically he had one goal and ...," Shut it. He was quite poor and the way he runs some actions when he stands in offside because he simply lack any sort of speed is just <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>  I guess Van Gaal believes in him and tries him to get into it again but sadly I don't think he can be that much better. He shouldn't be unbencheble. He could go down and Falcao could stay or Januzaj could go up front who can hold the play as well and make some fouls on him stretch the play and press the opposition. I think Berbatov was one of the slowest players who played for us as a striker, now its surely Robin and it makes me cry when there is a through ball and he isnt able to get on it because he is just too fecking slow, hes becoming one dimensional and simply shouldn't start games and who cares he scored. I believe we could score two goals anyway before the match as a TEAM..

726~~~
I don't think he was bad today, and that was a well taken goal. However, he's getting older and I reckon this is his last useful season.

727~~~
I thought he was quite good today as well but he is quite clearly our slowest player up front which imo is the main reason he sometimes seems to be "out of sync" with the team.

728~~~
What? No way.

729~~~
Wish people would stop mentioning his age and calling him OLD, i know he's grey like but he's only 31 not 41 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Ibrahimovic is 33 next week, no one goes on about his age all the time, look at Lampard still doing the business in the Premier League (36).

730~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Of course Van Persie was always famous for his speed when winning player of the year awards... 

Januzaj? Seriously? I mean, we're down to ten men so obviously a nineteen year old winger/ number ten is exactly the sort of player we need to hold the ball up.

731~~~
I think the difference is that RVP has had a history of injuries in the past. While some players can shake them off and continue to perform, some players become more susceptible as they age and begin to get injured more and more, which affects their overall game.

I don't think many people doubt RVP's ability to keep performing and scoring <i>if </i>he can stay fit, since a lot of his game is based off of his finishing, attacking intelligence and touch on the ball, but he'll be affected if injury problems become a big worry for him.

732~~~
As long he's scoring he's good.

733~~~
I thought he had a good game today. Scored a goal and linked up well with Rafa and Herrera. 

Should have come off instead of Falcao though. Looked half dead towards the end.

734~~~
I think his drifting to the right will be a major weapon as the season progresses.  His ability to link up with Herrera and Rafael was evident in some of our attacks down the right and the danger of him cutting in on his left foot will create a lot of space for them.

735~~~
he can paly as a striker if you watched reserves and had some quality spell off the striker in the first team as well. Van Persie used to be much faster watch some of his videos if you were not lucky enough to see him at younger age mate.-)

736~~~
50 goals for United in 81 appearances aint too bad. RVN did it in 68 appearances.

737~~~
What game were you watching? He was running his ass off when he was the only one up front, even in the 90th minute. 

Looks to me that some see some players in a certain way and they joust post the same shit over and over again after very single game, doesn't matter what the player actually does.

738~~~
Thought he was very good today, put in a proper shift as well, looked absolutely dead at the final whistle.

That little flick in the first half to Herrera (I think?) <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

739~~~
Congrats to Robin on his 50th Utd goal. Heres to the next 50.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kcDVVmBHNcg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

740~~~
Undoubtedly if we're to get anywhere this season we need him scoring goals, playing well and generally firing on all cylinders.

741~~~
I'm not convinced the formation is helping him or Falcao, they are both feeding off scraps in the box really.

742~~~
Well done for scoring 50 goals for us despite missing almost half of last season and despite being marginalised by Moyes. Was absolutely knackered in the end but did well today.

He also helps a lot in defence, I see him clearing lots of headers, tracking back, tackling, etc. But all I keep reading here is that only Rooney out of our strikers defends. It wouldn't surprise me if RvP had similar (or even better) defensive stats to Rooney.

743~~~
Took his goal well, but something not right about him, he's just not the same overall player he was just over a year ago. not to say he cant reach that level again.

744~~~
Thought he was a little better. Good goal. Still just lacked the extra things that Rooney will give us in that forward position in my opinion. Not judging that 2nd half though, he had a shit job to do and did it well, so good on him.

Will get a run now in the side with Mata in behind, so he really has to kick on now.

745~~~
His celebration after the fantastic header he scored against Spain in the WC, thats the Robin I want to see play for United. So animated, so determined, out for revenge sort of thing. Thats what I want him to do for United. So far even though he scored 2 in the last 2, that emotion isnt there in him.

746~~~
Had a good game today. Great goal. Showed patches of why he's considered world class. As long as he keeps scoring you can't keep him out of the team. Van Gaal is being proven right here.

747~~~
He was good today, glad to see him score again. People are foolish to write him off in my opinion, as has been mentioned Ibrahimovic is nearly 33, also Robben is 30, Ribery is 31, Toure 31 and all of them are very good players. 

Van Persie had injuries last season, but I think van Gaal will be able to manage him much better than Moyes did. The one from the Olympiakos game was unlucky- that can happen to anyone. But I think the one from around November to January was due in part to Moyes over playing him because he was desperate for results. We don't have that problem now with Falcao and Rooney (Wilson too) who can play the centre forward role.

748~~~
I thought it was his best game in a while - hopefully it's a case of playing him into form. He was tired by the end, but I got the impression he stepped-up his efforts when we were down to 10, which was clearly needed given the situation.

749~~~
He has continued to get better every game I think. Still wasn't involved enough and still had a few too many offsides. Other than that he was pretty good though I thought. Was exhausted at the end and couldn't really chase either.

750~~~
Good performance. Great goal, lovely work for creating another and has a tiny part in the buildup of the first.

Could have provided better hold up play when we were down to 10, but overall he seems to be improving.

751~~~
I don't know if Moyes to blame for that, but it's my impression RVP has become too heavy with muscles, it looks like he has gained about 7 kilo's since his Arsenal days. It's not dead weight but upper body strength isn't that important and the legs have to carry all that extra weight, and that for ninety minutes. Speaking of Ibrahimovic, about 8 years ago he had to train down his muscles because he lost the quickness of feet after becoming too muscular and heavy.

752~~~
Great thing about having him is, his goals in last 2 games despite being nowhere close to his best. I hope those goals have given him some confidence to improve further and reach the 2012-13 level.

753~~~
van Persie looks visibly slower to me.  Don't know if he's still dealing with post-injury or if this is for good.  Considering his age, we might be seeing the last 1-2 good seasons of him.

754~~~

That was beautiful <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

It Falcao had managed to get his head to Rooney's cross that would have been contender for goal of the season.

756~~~
The man's still a genius and showed signs of his magic against West Ham. He doesn't run games, but he doesn't need to, he's one of those players who is so gifted he can make things happen in a split second. Some great touches, well taken goal and another 90 minutes under his belt.

758~~~

759~~~
Oh yay deja vu. Only if Rio and Vida played more like Jagielka huh?

760~~~
If you read the article, all it's saying is that LVG is encouraging the players all to have their say and to pitch in when it comes to decisions/team meetings. I can't understand what the problem is with that. It seems to make sense to me. They are, after all, all in this together.

761~~~
It is very good thing tbf. As a player you have to question the manager if you don't agree with him or don't understand what he want from you and tell how you see the situation, tell you opinion and how you things could be better, and when you have this understanding with the manager and other players it helps team on the pitch.

762~~~

This man should have been captain, he will lead us to victory on Sunday.

Edit: It's page 20! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

763~~~
Maybe he's got to choose what kind of player he will end up like. If he wants to end his career as the agile quick player he probably should consider losing some muscle. Or he could accept that he's lost the lightness of youth and become a strong player in a more static role with his back to goal.

764~~~
Loved that he scored with his right foot too. Good strike.

765~~~
I was already prepared to yell at him for not passing to two of our players running into middle, but fiiiiine finish happened.

766~~~
Yeah, you could see the defender was also expecting him to use his left. RvP jinked and the defender commited, wrongly and RvP was clear to take the shot with his right. Very clever footwork as usual.

767~~~
The phrase 'chocolate leg' really creeps me out. Felt I had to get that off my chest.

768~~~

769~~~
Remember how he hit the crossbar against Spain ( chocolate leg ) .

770~~~
set Falcao up for a couple of goals please. As much as I like you scoring yourself!

771~~~
Van Persie was putting in 8/10 performances consistently for us in 12/13, though his form was average towards the end of the season. Some of us forget - myself included - just how great and influential he was in Fergie's last season. I don't think he'll be as effective because he's physically declined and no longer possesses that extra bit of sharpness which elevated his game, but he's still a very good centre-forward and has steadily improved.

Fergie's best move was to play Van Persie in a role that took advantage of his excellent skill-set, and I'm certain that Moyes' use of Van Persie affected his overall confidence and form. To go from an integral part of the attack under Fergie, to being a poacher/classic #9 must have annoyed him. (Watch the videos below to see the difference.)

Two of my favourite Van Persie performances:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RPNsYDT3NCI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1YuuOt_Vo3c?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Does anyone think he can reach those level of performance for us again?

772~~~
He was very good even when he had that streak where he didn't score for 10 games or something like that.

I have no doubt he will be very good this season if he stays fit.

773~~~
He was absolutely magnificent, but his form took a bit of a dip towards the end of the season. He was so good the most part of that season though that I honestly think only Ronaldo has had a better individual season for us since the turn of the millennium. It seemed like it was written in the stars that he would be the catalyst that brought the CL trophy back as well. If it hadn't been for that atrocious red card Nani got, I still think it might have happened. Still bitter about that one <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

I doubt he'll ever get back to those heights again. He's looked like he's missing that little something that elevated him from very good to absolutely great since the start of last season. Still a very good player mind, but I doubt we'll ever see that Robin van Persie that simply looks a class above everyone else on the pitch again.

Thankfully Di Maria is filling that role now <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

774~~~
It's those lime boots I tell ya. He wore them in his final season at Arsenal and his first at United.

Ever since he stopped wearing them, his performances haven't been the same!

775~~~
I am his fan, but it's quite obvious he is past it. Slow as tank, hardly involved in the build up anymore, lacking that sharpness he used to have in his first season with us, and his offside situations are really annoying. If his name isn't Robin van Persie he would be nowhere near starting XI.

776~~~
Not really at the races today (and if a certain No.10 had put in that kind of performance, there'd already be two pages of abuse and vitriol in his thread).

But it's way too soon to be writing the guy off. Wouldn't be at all surprised to see him pick up form as the season goes on.

777~~~
I've defended him up until now but today was tragic. Slowed our play down to a walking pace when he refused to pass to one of our players making a great run. He seems to think he should always take about ten touches before he passes.

778~~~
I don't want to say he's getting preferential treatment but it does feel that at the moment he is staying on questionably at times. He worked hard for most the game but looked tired. With Mata think they were the two that needed to be subbed.

779~~~
Poor from him again, I thought his goals would spur him on but he's looking worse. His slowness ruins our fast paced attacks and I do hope LVG would drop him soon.

780~~~
Should've come off instead of Falcao. Was decent in possession but hardly did anything apart from that.

781~~~
VP and Mata slowed everything down.

782~~~
Surprised that he's getting criticism. Thought he was a lot better overall, worked hard, and looked very sharp and agile on the ball. A lot more sharp then anything we've seen from him in the last year pretty much. Didn't get into any goalscoring positions or any chances really but his overall game was good.

783~~~
I hate it when there is a quick succession of passing or when there is a need to play a quick pass that RVP keeps the ball to himself, look for invisible solutions only to make a poor pass in the end. It completely kills the momentum, Falcao hasn't got the same skillset but he keeps it simple and more fluid.

784~~~
Agree entirely. Boggled my mind that he stayed on, and I think it's due to the relationship he has with LvG. He held onto the ball for too long and ignored Rafael at one point when the pass should have been made.

785~~~
No, Falcao can't play 90 mins yet. He looked done for when he came off.

786~~~
No. Falcao most probably isn't fully fit yet.

787~~~
He was shit today, Mata and Falcao were equally shit, but at least they managed an assist and a goal. He was just useless, needs to step up his game.

788~~~
Falcao and Van Persie: does it work?  I would argue that the two of them don't work together as a front two, and are both players that should be spear-heading an attack as lone strikers.  Falcao is working his way back to fitness after long time out from injury, and I think his goal today is going to be a great confidence boost for him.  Van Persie still looks like he's feeling the effects of playing the World Cup, but it's the same World Cup that all these other Dutch players, and Brazilian, German,and Argentinian players played just as much of a part in (if not more), and they don't seem to be struggling.  

Removing one of them from the strikeforce to start matches means two things: 1) you've got an experienced striker who can come off the bench if need be, and 2) you can replace them with a midfielder, which helps to solve the issue of losing possession, which is something that Van Gaal knows is an issue because he's spoken about it himself.  Taking one of them out doesn't mean that they're relegated to the status of super-sub, because you can always rotate them, and with both of them not quite fit it means that they can get some rest.

789~~~
Frustrating today, he's head was never in the game, wasted so many passes with poor decision making and never looked like scoring.

I think in order for this system to work we need a rapid quick striker up front, Reus/Falcao, Reus/RVP ..etc.   Both Falcao and RVP stay too centrally.

790~~~
Agreed. He's a much slower player these days in all aspects of his game.

Given that United play best with a speedy attack I'm not entirely sure he suits us anymore? 

Unless LVG is sentimental if he plays like he did today all season this should be his last season with us before we purchase a world class replacement next summer.

791~~~
He's not the same player he was two years ago, and should not be given a free pass based on his performances.

792~~~
That has also a lot to do with the interaction between players, Falcao often recieves the ball in a situation where the right and immediate choice is obvious. It's not working smoothly around Van Persie, what would mean he would have more options to play it quickly to.  I also don't think Falcao really deserved to stay on the pitch for 90 minutes, he's been quite waistfull.

793~~~
Not interested or something, just doesn't seem fit.

794~~~
Should be dropped for the next game. LVG would never do that though.

795~~~
He needs to be benched.  His performances so far this season have made our cheap sale of Welbz look a tragic decision.  You forget he is even playing most of the match.

796~~~
It just looks like he's declined physically so much in the past two seasons. Technically I'm sure it's all there but his build-up/hold-up play is really lacking and he can't seem to get on the end of things. Needs dropping, but I can't see it happening.

It wasn't just his physical flaws today that stood out for me, but his decision making was bad as well. Usually he is a lot more intelligent and assured on possession, but today he just seemed like he didn't know what to do with the ball today. The RVP with his game on point would have scored that chance on Stones' slip up.

798~~~
Yeah, he still looks a bit off the pace. He had a chance towards the end on the left hand side that he'd have probably blasted into the net at his best, yet he was unable to even get a shot off. Hopefully he'll improve over time.

799~~~
Can't wait for him to start playing again. 


What's that?

800~~~
Not at the races today, seems odd.

801~~~
Talk about a slow start to the season. Don't want to judge strikers on one game. 6 starts 2 goals so far. Some moments of real quality against West Ham but otherwise he has looked such an ordinary player. Di Maria is firing in tons of quality crosses yet RVP doesn't even look like he's going to get on the end of one.

802~~~
He didn't look like getting on the end of one today but he's had plenty of chances this season. Poor performance today after an improvement last week. I thought Van Persie, Mata and Falcao were all shite.

803~~~
Agree with that assessment. Don't know where to start with our attack. Some big reputations but the actual quality of their play this season has been mid-table.

804~~~
Clearly a favourite of Louis (most managers have them). I just think others (Falcao) are doing more for the team than him.

805~~~
still nowhere near his old form of 2011 to 2013.

806~~~
8th time's the charm.

807~~~
How did he stay on for the full 90?... Seriously, with the yellow card in the first half and I was shit scared with the incident towards Howard in the end..

Yet, He won't get as much stick as Rooney did for last week.

808~~~
Not really surprising since most people posting on here are genuinly clueless. Love the hysterical random talk about how suddenly he slows everything down and his link up play is not good, reading the comments you'd think Robin turned into Emile Heskey. And obviously RVP and Falcao can't play together, I mean it's not like Falcao gave two assists to Robin in the first two games they ever played in the same team.

In reality there really wasn't much wrong with his game today, nothing special either but he looked good overall.

809~~~
He's looking a lot sharper on the ball again, but he's slow as f*ck right now. Which is a worry.

810~~~
Odd? Or old?

811~~~
The incident where Howard came out of his goal and pushed him for no reason? What do you want him to be criticised for there?

812~~~
I think he's struggling to accept being in the shadow of Di Maria and Falcao. He's trying to make things happen and is just miserably failing. 

He's never been blessed with pace so he doesn't seem slow, he just seems overly eager to have that magic moment himself - typical of a number 9. No excuses though, he was a bit shit.

813~~~
He reacted back. The ref could have easily dished out yellow card for both Howard and RVP, knowing our luck with refs this season.

814~~~
Both!

815~~~
He's become bit of a luxury player right now.

And his touch is off. This can't carry on for too long in this formation especially.

816~~~
can't wait for him to break loose.

817~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> you expect RvP to be criticized as much as Rooney....yet RvP wasn't sent off recklessly? 

Come on. Criticise him for his form yeah. Not for something non existent.

818~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

819~~~
The shadow of Falcao?

820~~~
Good old Robin needs a rocket up his arse at the moment. Wouldn't believe by looking at him it was so early in the season. Hope that he can pick up soon for his own sake as there is so much competition. Bit annoying that he is immune to substitution, maybe one of those who needs to play himself into form. Playing like that though it weakens the team.

821~~~
He talked to Howard. What was he going to get booked for? Not running away?

822~~~
I have a horrible feeling he's past his best.

823~~~
He was dog shit today.

824~~~
He's done very well never to be sent offfor us given he's a fiesty little fecker.I like it though

825~~~
Hes getting there.

Another three gears to go up.

Maybe theres too much empthesis on the actual 10 role. With Di Maria proving such a hit starting off from deep bursting forward while adding immense service to the wings,feck it,build the team around that and the goals will flow.

Van P and Radamel look like when they click we ll have the best partnership this year.

Carrick coming back is a huge plus especially with Blind whos gonna really make a name for himself,in the same midfield holding pair.Buy Strootman in January and i reckon well take third.

Now the problem some will view it as,and have been panderring about for months,which is understandable,how do fit  Wayne,Mata,Vanp,Falcao in the same team. And its simple you dont.

I Posted about this a long time ago about the real problem the team faces,and to me when Vanp really hits top form again,Wayne and Mata are very droppable for vp and Herrera.

----Carrick-------Blind-----
-----------Herrera----------
-----------Dimaria----------
-----VanP----------falcao-----

It allows for alot of variation giving the fullbacks we have.

It just looks so solid the way things are coming together

826~~~
You're right but don't you remember the instance where Rafa was opened and RVP just simply refused to pass it to him. It's not an issue of situation, RVP is slow in his movement and slow at releasing the ball

827~~~
Doesn't deserve his place on current form. It's frustrating to see a talent like Januzaj stagnating on the bench while RVP starts every game offering little. Add the fact that we are playing with two many strikers to begin with and you start to wonder what the hell is going on

828~~~
Our worst player today by some distance and needs to be benched. If Rooney had delivered a performance like that, people on here would have slaughter him.

He looks sluggish, has poor touches and there were numerous times today where he slowed down our play. Don't know if it's a fitness issue or just a dip in form, but right now, i would not like to see him on the teamsheet

829~~~
Did some excellent pointing in the early stages today. I mean, he was really point at people/positions that our players should occupy... the way he extended his arm one way, threw up a finger, before moving his other arm up and raising another finger was really something to behold.

Shame he was otherwise rubbish though.

830~~~
He has literally <i>zero</i> competition for his place and is out of form.

If he was going to "play himself into form" he would've done it by now. The best thing for him and for his game would be for LvG to drop him and make him fight for his place, that's the only way you'll get that hunger back.

He's too close to the manager I think. It's a problem.

831~~~
Yeah because this thread is full of people saying how amazing he's been and hardly anyone is suggesting he's past it. Why is life so unfair on Wayne Rooney?

832~~~
He had to play today IMO. We're lacking in leaders / experience.

833~~~
It's a bit worrying how many times the attack died at his feet. I'd rather he tried a difficult first time pass and lose it than cut onto the left foot every time, wait for everyone to catch up, then pass it to Blind. In saying that, I can't shake the feeling that he's one more goal away from going on a rampage against Premier League defenses. He's too talented to give up on, and I'd give him another 3 or 4 games before I'd consider benching him.

834~~~
Well, the difference is that Rooney gets a lot more vitriol for similar performances.

835~~~
When Rooney comes back, he will have competition in that LVG could move Rooney up front and drop RVP for Mata to play in behind, even though Mata has demonstrated little more than RVP to warrant a place in the side. If LVG <i>really </i>wanted to drop him, he could play Wilson up front.

I really think people are overstating the bias LVG has when picking players. People were saying this about Rooney a couple of weeks back, for example. We've got plenty of attacking players, and while RVP hasn't been brilliant, he's still managed to grab a couple of goals in the two games leading up to today. If he was playing appalling stuff <i>and </i>not scoring I could understood frustration at LVG not dropping him, but that's not really been the case.

836~~~
Rooney was universally adored by Utd fans at one time. The reason he isn't any longer is down to one man only. This isn't the thread for a discussion like that though. If you think Van Persie hasn't been strongly criticised then you haven't been paying attention.

837~~~
I'm not sure about that, it's like Giggs said in his twilight years - When you have a few bad games in your twenties, you're out of form. When you have a few bad games in your thirties, you're too old and past your best. RVP should have at least another 2 or 3 seasons in him but he's not looked himself for us for quite a long time now.

838~~~
Id rather be playing another man in the centre of the pitch right now than a 2nd striker doing very little.

839~~~
I would love to see Adnan go into the #10 position in the diamond and Falcao and Rooney play up front after the Chelsea game.

840~~~
Shocking performance today! Something isn't right, you don't go from performing like a world class player 3 months ago at the WC to then suddenly looking old and past it.  My bet is that he's plagued by an injury that he's not letting on and that's affecting his performance.  I don't buy the disinterested aspect because he simply has no reason to be.  He's played in every game since he was fit, he's scored a few goals and we are winning.  That doesn't equate to a disinterested player.

841~~~
If he was from any other country than Holland he wouldn't play. At least he should've been off instead of Falcao today. Falcao was actually getting into positions, even if he took his time to get the goal. I have a feeling that first goal will open the floodgates, though, and he deserved to stay on to see if he could've added to it.

RvP did nothing at all and has been poor for a while, even if he's managed to nick a couple of goals. Falcao has been consistently better, though.

842~~~
Rooney gets slaughter after a bad touch so I'm not too bother if everyone gives RVP some stick.

But personally i judge him as a goal scorer! he didn't score today so he had an average game.

But his striking partner did score so the criticism shouldn't be too severe.

843~~~
He should've went off instead of Falcao. But I don't think he had a bad game. Was actually doing a lot of hard work in the first half, winning tackles and had some neat build up play. I don't think he can play 90 mins currently though.

844~~~
He'll be our top scorer at the end of the season. He's still quality, he's just playing in a team that hasn't settled yet and he's surrounded by completely new players. Him and Falcao are still learning each other's game- which is probably doubly difficult since they both play in the same position. He no longer has the luxury of being the focal point of our attack, ala Costa at Chelsea. We're spreading the goals around the team a lot more now, and that's due in large part to RVP and the like working hard off the ball and opening up space for the likes of Di Maria and Herrera.

845~~~
I'm not sure how neat his build up play actually was. He lost the ball a few times and did his ever present ball dither when in a dangerous position that he seems to like this season. It was a 6/10, all in all.

846~~~
Adnan Januzaj, I believe he will give us an extra outlet if he was used in a role similar to that played by Robben at the WC. He will offer us something different which could hopefully occupy defenders and free up room for Di Maria and Rooney. RVP should be dropped as his performances do not warrant an undroppable status.

847~~~
I don't think RVP will improve as long as he is playing alongside Falcao. Too many cooks.

848~~~
I thought he wasn't anywhere near his best at the World Cup either. Much of the same as we've seen from him for us so far this season. The Dutch were all about Robben at the WC.

849~~~
He looks slow, ponderous and this was exemplified by his chance in the second half 

His movement was good and he and Falcao seem to be on a good wave length 

A bit like Falcao I think we need to be creating a few more chances and we'll see a lot more goals and more sharpness 

We are lacking a bit of pace and had Falcao not picked up a knock I think RVP would have been subbed

850~~~
Yeah people seriously need to stop peddling that shit.

He was decent against Spain but his performance will be exaggerated by THAT goal, then didn't really do much of note after that.

As you said it was all Robben, RVP was pretty invisible throughout the tournament really.

I just think he's lost any pace he had (he was never lightning quick) and injuries have taken their toll on his acceleration and agility too. This is just the Robin we've got now.

That said we could do with creating a bit more so he can get more involved. His link up play in 12/13 was excellent but we seemingly don't let him move from right up top now so he doesn't come deep and get on the ball.

851~~~
I like Januzaj, but I think you're overrating the presence he's going to have in our team. He'll certainly be useful, but he's certainly not going to have an impact similar to someone like Robben. I'd like to see Januzaj get more time, but where's he going to play? RVP for Januzaj is hardly like for like.

852~~~
Signs of age are slowly getting to him but I believe he can have two maybe even three decent seasons of football... coming from the bench.

As much as I love him team needs to progress constantly to catch on with the football world. He may be in trouble if he won't sharpen his poacher skills.

853~~~
Januzaj for RVP would make the team far more balanced. We're too top heavy and narrow

854~~~
Agreed on all parts. The bolded bit has confused me a bit, as I would have expected Falcao to be the one leading the line, but he seems to move around and get involved more than Robin does.

855~~~
No, it's not. But should we be trying to force two number 9s into every stating line-up?

Should we even be contemplating it, in fact?

856~~~
Completely agreed. No player should be undroppable anyway, and Adnan deserves a shot already. This is getting a bit ridiculous how little gametime he's  seeing, but perhaps that's for another thread.

857~~~
Got himself involve in an alcaration with Tim Howard towards the end there...

858~~~
I think some of you are being harsh on him. He did notably slow down the play a couple of times but he's still the best striker we have in terms of playing with his back to goal.

859~~~
I actually would like to see us go back to a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 in the long run. While I think that playing with two out and out strikers can work for some games I would be more comfortable if we managed to go back to a 5 man midfield and only one striker in the long run.

860~~~
Replacing Van Persie with a like player is only going to compound the imbalance, Januzaj will offer something different to RVP, Mata, Rooney or Falcao. His ability to run at defenses with the ball, his creativity will make us function better as a team enabling us to get more from Falcao, Rooney and others. The beauty of playing him as a support striker is that he could pop up in any position creating a degree of uncertainity for the defense, how do you mark him out?

861~~~
I think he looks physically weaker then before, like it's an effort for him just to play, he used to glide around the pitch effortlessly. I also don't think playing with a partner suits him or Falcao.

862~~~
I dont understand for a former winger, why does he never try to get past his man, or make something happen, hes almost becoming valencia like in that dithering on the ball he does, and then just turns around and passes it to someone else, needs to try taking some long shots, instead of waiting for the ball to fall to his feet

Dont understand how hes dropped in quality so much

863~~~
It's funny, for all the Rooney criticism, he's comfortably our best forward as of now.

I think van Persie was poor again today, he is capable of sticking it in the net though...

864~~~
It's not a stretch to suggest he's over the hill. 31 is the back end of someones peak but that drop can come sooner and sharper if you've had injuries throughout your career which Robin obviously has.

Look at Henry. He went from a brilliant year in 2008/09 with Eto'o and Messi to absolutely useless in such a short space of time.

865~~~
You could argue that Falcao will take that slot if he continues to improve, although a lot of Rooney's criticism is often over the top.

866~~~
Very poor performance today. Slowed down the attack far too many times, lost the ball unnecessarily and did nothing to add to possession or a defensive shift.

867~~~
You could play him up top with Falcao for every minute of every game, and the partnership will barely improve. He's just not a partnership striker, and he labours too much to be the solo striker. 
He's done what he was bought for, and we'll still see some special goals, but I'd entertain letting him go in the summer. 

And that's not even based on the games this season, let alone today.

868~~~
The fact is, he'll score around 20 goals this season. And it's bloody hard to find 20 goals a season players.

Don't think the partnership with Falcao is an issue - Falcao has set him up twice now afterall.

Van Persie will be fine and will undoubtedly make a big contribution to anything we achieve this season.

869~~~
Surely Falcao would be better up front on his own now, sad as it is to say but RvP just doesn't look as good right now, and is a bit of a luxury we can't afford, would rather see an extra body next to Blind, Herrera, Rooney, Di Maria, and Falcao are more than adequate to score the goals.

870~~~
On current form, it should be Rooney and Falcao up front and Mata as the Number 10. Mata is not that convincing as well but he is somewhat better than Van Persie at the moment.

If Van Gaal does indeed rate Januzaj as a forward, then the WBA game is surely a good time to use him there, considering Van Persie's form.

871~~~
I think problem is not not rating Januzaj but benching RVP considering his relationship.

He's been invisible 2nd half of last 3 games and not been taken off while we've had to carry him as a luxury.


LVG has to show his famous balls in this sooner rather than later.

872~~~
Is he? I've not been overly convinced by RVP as of late, but he's managed to grab a couple of goals, which is his primary job as a striker. Mata's job is largely to create and dictate the play, but he was anonymous today and with the exception of the QPR game, has been fairly poor this season overall. I'd rather have Rooney as the number 10 for this side than Mata, to be honest.

873~~~
How long until he gets match fit? He's played more than all our strikers and keeps looking worse. Once minute 65 congress around every game he's done. Falcao definitely should have stayed on.

874~~~
In my opinion, Rooney is more effective as a striker and not as a No 10. Van Persie's goals were not that impressive as well. His overall contribution is my main concern, though. But I am aware of his actual ability, it's just his form isn't that great on the eyes.

875~~~
Arguably, although when you take Rooney out of the number 10 role, you often reduce the overall impact he can have on the game as when he performs he can be a superb number 10. He's been looking impressive as of late, and I'd feel much more confident with him in the role than Mata. RVP has been managing to do his primary job of scoring on a couple of occasions, but Mata has been fairly anonymous in his creative role.

876~~~
Falcao had looked better sing this and bringing people into plays. RvP is worryingly looking like he's a busted flush except if he gets it within 18 yards of goal.

877~~~
He is probably going to get injured this season so you guys will get your wish eventually.

878~~~
Very poor today when you expected him to be fitter and better, don't know what to make of him at them moment.

879~~~
There's certainly more to suggest these two work better than Rooney and RVP at least, they seem to adapt to each others runs and actually pass to each other.

Similarly Rooney and Falcao looks like it works a bit better in terms of actually linking with each other, though Rooney has been playing deeper obviously.

880~~~
I still think RvP will score more for us this year than Falcao or Rooney<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>. 

He's just a classy player. Even if he got injured and never played for us again, I'll always love him for winning us #20 with his sheer brilliance along with Carrick.

881~~~
I was watching this game half cut but every time I lifted my head he was slowing down every single counter attack. Utter wank.

882~~~
I keep saying this, but he misses too many easy chances. Even when he scored 30, he should have got more.

883~~~
A few times he and Falcao made the same run and were in each other's space. Hopefully they sort that out as their partnership develops. If Mata had played well then I would say that RvP should be benched for Rooney. Since Mata was pretty average though and LvG clearly likes van Persie I can see him retaining his position for a while.

884~~~
I feel like I watched an entirely different game... I thought rvp was very good. Led by example making tackles and putting in a shift. Usual classy ball control, build up and movement. Only frustration for me was him missing that early first time chance from a di Maria cross. Both he and Falcao could have given us a solid early lead, neither were able to despite being two of the top 5 or 6 forwards around. 

I really can't believe we're talking about rvp in this way. He's still the most talented player we've got imo (maybe di Maria...).

885~~~
You definitely watched a different game. 

He was pretty poor yesterday, his movement didn't look great and the moment where he took the ball off di Maria and was offside was incredibly moronic. His technique is good so he kept the ball well to pass it backwards a few times, but it definitely wasn't a lethal performance or anything remotely similar yesterday.  

There's also absolutely no doubt he's not the most talented player in our squad, and I'm a bit worried like others about a possible decline. I really thought Van Gaal's arrival would reinvigorate him after a poor season and a mediocre WC, but so far it hasn't looked that way at all. Really hope he picks it up though.

886~~~
Thought it was probably the best I've seen him play this season. Although that's faint praise, unfortunately.

887~~~
Van Persie's form is pretty worrying IMO, Last year he had the excuse that he wasn't happy with the Moyes regime etc. But now we have got arguably his favourite manager at the club and his form is actually not any better, I think his World Cup performances were slightly overrated aswell, He was great against Spain in the 1st game but then looked pretty tired after that.

The problem is, at the moment he (along with Rooney) are being exempt from any substitutions or time on the bench and this is still not spurring Van Persie on, In fact i'd probably argue it's doing the opposite, Yesterday he should of been replaced before Falcao yet stayed on the pitch and contributed very little. I really hope he does turn this around because once he is firing on all cylinders then he is arguably one of the best players in the League but he really needs to start picking it up, and fast as we have some big games coming up

888~~~
Doesn't he still need that surgery? I remember a lot of talk about that when we signed Falcao.

889~~~
Wont be surprised if he is indeed carrying an injury. But its rather uneccessary if true. Should get the operation done as soon as he can.

Sometimes, though, he seemed kinda lacking motivation. It is like he works hard because he has to, not because he wants to.

890~~~
He has been poor for a while, last season he was mostly average as well. We need to question how much of that is simply because of poor run of form and to which extent this is caused by ageing. An extended injury is possible as well, he had plenty of issues in the past and this is bound to come back and haunt him at some point.

891~~~
He laughed at surgery rumours I believe.

892~~~
Oh <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

I was hoping that was the reason for his sluggish performances.

893~~~
The injury thing was denied by RvP and LvG not too long ago I thought. Of course it could be them lying or something but I am not sure.

894~~~
If he's carrying an injury - and Van Gaal know about it - why is he consistently playing 90 minutes while other players are being subbed off before him?

Of course, the second half of that sentence is a pretty good standalone question in it's own right. It looks horribly like simple favouritism. I really hope not, though.

895~~~
First I thought he was injured, then I figured he was just unfit, then I assumed he just needed a goal to kick start his season, then I thought getting the captaincy would be the jolt up the arse that he needed.

I'm running out of ideas now... anyone?

896~~~
Falcao is occupying his spaces? Same old same old.

897~~~
LvG clearly wants both Falcao and RvP upfront. He has made this very clear in different ways several times:

"I like Falcao, but I like van Persie also"
"Van Persie/Falcao need to play in order to hit top form"
...
He is not dropping them unless he has to (injury).

The thing currently is, that not only is he not dropping RvP, but he is actually keeping him on for 90 minutes every single time. I wouldn't necessarily drop him, but at times it has been clear he was out of steam but somehow still managed to finish the game. Well yesterday as captain he celebrated DDG's save and gave him a pat on the head afterwards! That probably will be enough to play another 90 mins against West Brom.

898~~~
It feels like he just doesnt fit into our new set up - he's not connecting with the others and has yet to make the step up into our new team.

I cant see LVG dropping him but it would be interesting to see how we'd play without him

899~~~
Doesn't look like Van Persie is missing match fitness to me. 

Looks more like he's missing match arsedness.

He should be told to watch one of his games from two years ago on repeat until he puts in a performance like that - he was doing so week in, week out - now looks like he can barely be bothered to move unless the ball comes to him in the box.

900~~~
He just doesn't look like he is enjoying himself to me, understandable last year when Fergie left and MOyes came in but not so understandable this season. With RVP I find it hard to believe its a confidence thing as he has bucket loads.

901~~~
He didn't watch a different game at all. RVP wasn't poor yesterday, it was a 6/10 performance - nothing special but definitely not poor.

Your comments about him having a poor season last year are laughable and pretty much show what you're about.

For your information, in the 2013/2014 season:

He scored 13 goals in 18 matches for Holland. If you disregard obligatory friendlies he scored 10 goals in 10 matches (World Cup+Qualifiers) for Holland, apparently that is to be considered poor?

He also scored 18 goals in 28 matches for us during the Moyes reign. How the feck does a player who scores 30+ goals in a season, while being injured a lot, have a poor season?

Saying he had a mediocre World Cup is even more laughable, since he scored 4 goals in 6 matches and he hit the woodwork twice. Without him we would've never made it to the semi-finals, and the fact that he wasn't even fit enough to play the full 90 minutes in most matches make his performances even more impressive. Only Muller and James had a way better World Cup, Robben looked better but scored less than RVP while both played as a striker in a 3-5-2, Neymar was looking good, but RVP was definitely one of the best attacking players last tournament, I don't see how that should be named 'mediocre'.

I also love your statement about how there is "also absolutely no doubt he's <b>not</b> the most talented player in our squad", apparently you are quite the connoisseur. Or you're just the ultimate hyperbole lover; I mean it's obvious that Di Maria is our best player at the moment, no doubt. But I could make a very good case for Rooney or RVP being the most talented players in our squad. Based on the level they showed when they were 18 and looking at their best seasons, compared to Di Maria when he was 18 and looking at his best season to day (last season at Real Madrid obviously), you have to admit both RVP and Rooney have showed more talent than Di Maria. Yet you make it out like there is absolutely no doubt that there are more talented players in our squad than RVP, that's just ridiculous.

902~~~
Sorry but that's utter bollox. There must be at least a dozen players, probably more, who had a better tournament. In fact, I could name three or four Dutch players who had a better tournament!

903~~~
Right now I’m having amnesia and déjà vu at the same time. I think I’ve forgotten this before.

904~~~
Yea I'd agree with that. Didn't really stamp his authority in any of the games at Brazil. Wasn't really any fear factor from him. 

Hasn't really lighted the burners under van Gaal here. Decision making was pretty poor yesterday. He looks off the pace and oddly enough, hasn't seem to have fitted into this system despite coming from Arsenal where passing and movement are prized. Needs to click into gear soon because his place is the one under threat IMO.

905~~~
You can tell a lot about a players confidence and form by their first touch then subsequent movement.

This season he seems to be caught flat footed quite a bit and doesn't seem all that ready to receive the ball. Then when he's got the ball he doesn't seem to be as direct or incisive as what he was in 12/13. Could almost say he looks down on confidence. He doesn't look to really take defenders on and push them back.  In his first season with us when the ball was in the final third he was the guy you wanted to have it, always looked the most likely to score or create something.

Doesn't seem to be a fitness or injury thing to me. Though I could be wrong. Not sure either if having Falcao there is helping either. They don't seem to get in each other's way but maybe it's a mental thing. Not feeling like the main man up front anymore.

906~~~
He wasn't poor, but he just looked, as usual, like he can't play with a partner and doesn't fit in with the rest of the team at all.

907~~~
By watching him play? I watched all the Utd games last season, while he had a statistically decent season, I thought his season was really mediocre, by his standards. Injury and Moyes didn't help of course and they're mitigating factors, but I still don't feel he had a good season. 
He started off brilliantly against Spain and then looked tired and not that great. I'm surprised you're contesting this, I don't think anyone would dispute Robben had a much better WC than him (there were a lot of cries when Messi got the award as best player instead of Robben, not instead of RvP). Once it reached the knock out games, he was definitely mediocre, and I don't even think he was that excellent in the group stages. 
Should have said 'no doubt in my mind', my mistake. It's very obviously just an opinion I'm giving... like most of the posts on this forum, as a whole.

908~~~
Tell that to Casillas.

909~~~
One game. Iker didn't do himself any favours by playing crap either.

910~~~
He wasnt playing a lone front man and helped his team to third in a world cup,he was imposing,his presence alone frees others up.

Anyway yeah he didnt set the world on fire but he wasnt brock either.

911~~~
That's the point I was agreeing with Pogue on <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> Not the worst but not the best. Could easily name a dozen players who had better tournaments.

912~~~
Sorry mate,misinterpreted the conversation flow.<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

913~~~
Some people are too quick to write RvP off. The issue is that he operates best as our the focal point of our attack. Obviously now, however, he has Falcao up top with him. We won't see the best out of either player unless one of them is dropped or put on the wing.

914~~~
So you conveniently forget the second part of my sentence? If you read it again you'll see I meant one of the best attacking players of the tournament, perhaps it was confusing because it was a long sentence.

It's almost impossible to compare defenders to attackers and or defensive midfielders to wingers and all. Personally I don't think the likes of Vlaar, De Jong, or Blind or perhaps De Vrij had a better World Cup than Van Persie, but it's a very difficult one to compare. A bit like having Pirlo playing a perfect match for Italy, and then having Muller score a nasty hat-trick the same day, you could spend hours debating which of the two was a better perfmance.

915~~~
He needs to be benched but I don't think LVG is going to do it anytime soon. Falcao spearheading the attack with Rooney being the second-striker and Mata behind those 2 seems like the way to go for me.

916~~~
Its too early to write off the RVP-Falcao experiment. They do seem to look to pass to each other. Just like Mata they have 2 more games to show that they are our best combination up front.

917~~~
I was specifically addressing the first clause in that sentence. The idea that only two players had a better tournament. Which is nonsense. It's also nonsense to claim that only two "attacking players" had a better tournament fwiw. 

And yes, it was a confusing sentence. Not because it was long, because it was badly structured.

918~~~
Yeah well if you just watched him play for United last season I guess I can see why you feel he was poor. And that's what I don't like about it, he still scored some vital goals for us, and when he was playing for Holland, in a team that was confident and well organised he didn't look poor at all. So for me it's quite obvious he was struggling because United was playing so dire, not because he was in poor form or anything. And he had more than enough good moments for United last season to justify that thought imo.

I was contesting RVP being 'mediocre' by the way, and I already said Robben looked better and I genuinly feel Robben deserves the credit for having a better World Cup. But I don't feel RVP had much less of a tournament than Robben, so saying Robben was 'way better' feels very unfair. 8/10 for Van Persie, 8.5/10 for Robben, something like that would be my rating. James getting a 9/10, Muller a 8.5/10 and Messi and Neymar 8/10.

Andyeah, obviously it was an opinion, I was just surprised how sure you were that RVP is not the most talented player in our squad. For me it's a very close call between Rooney, RVP and possibly Di Maria, and I really wouldn't know who of those three has more talent. Who do you consider the most talented player in our squad? Looking at your name I'd say Rooney, which is fair enough for me.

919~~~
Now I'm confused too.

920~~~
Nah my favourite player is Rooney, for a variety of reasons, a few of them quite subjective, but I don't think he's the most talented. 

I think Di Maria is head and shoulders above all those we have at the moment, but that's also cos I believe he's amongst the three best players in the world, full stop. 'Talented' is a tricky one though, cos does that mean just potential talent notwithstanding form (in which case you could make a case about Berbatov being one of the most 'talented' players around?), or current best? I mean I think RvP is immensely talented at his best, but I don't feel he's been performing that well for a while (our opinions differ on the WC and last season in that respect), so his innate talent from my point of view isn't that important, and I'm just wondering whether it's a decline we're witnessing or whether he's going to pick it up and get back to his best, of course wishing strongly for that to happen.

921~~~
Di Maria is our best player by a country mile. Not sure why it's even being discussed. RvP is talented and will get you goals but he can perform much better. I have no excuses for him, not lacking fitness or any of this nonsense. Sadly I think he's declining. What annoys me about him now is that he just looks lethargic. He will score one goal but miss a couple other chances and not make much of an impact in the game. 

I'm not the type of person that believes because a player has scored in a game it means he's played well, similarly I don't believe that if an attacker doesn't score it means he's performed badly. He's been relatively poor this and last year for Moyes even though his goal record doesn't look too shabby. If it was up to me I would drop him but Van Gaal likes him it seems. He's still got good movement and all and can still finish chances well but he is missing too many chances and becoming anonymous in some games even if he scores. 

Madrid away in the Champions League 2 seasons back, I thought he was excellent. Even though he didn't score his overall game was really brilliant in my opinion. But now, I've seen it a few times, when we try and attack with pace he gets the ball and slows the play down then the counter attack is ruined. I hope he improves and it's just bad form but I don't think so.

922~~~
Really? I thought it was one of his worst performances.

923~~~
Well I guess with the Cafe's obsession for raw pace and speed and all, seing an 38 year old Totti who's slow as feck scoring a perfect goal vs. City gives me a lot of hope regarding RVP's future.

Talent is very tricky indeed, very interesting subject though. I remember when Wayne was 16 and he scored that goal against Arsenal, I remember him being on fire at Euro 2004. His debut for us, he scored a great goal in a Champions League final for us. He scored 27 league goals for us playing as #10/Second striker mostly. He's had so many brilliant performances, scored an insane amount of goals and did so many incredible things to help us win titles. Go and compare that to Di Maria, who is only 2 years and 4 months younger than Rooney. I'd say it would be very unfair to say that Rooney has (showed) less talent than Di Maria. But then again, with the way our Angel is playing at the moment I can see why people would consider him the most talented. Guess it will always be a matter of preference, that's why it's so interesting.

924~~~
Come to think about it, and it's a bit RVP connected, do we have any player that was immensely shit ( 90% of the squad if not more ) under Moyes last season and kicked off well this season?

So far in games we've played, our best players were either the newcommers ( Herrera, ADM ), youth that's playing their first season for senior team or players who are in the '10%' - Rooney, Rafael and DDG.

Not that I'm trying to defend RVP here by the way, just wanted to compare him to somebody who was bad and kicked off fantastically this season yet I couldn't find a single player.

925~~~
It's an interesting question actually.

Phil Jones? He was fairly poor last season but very good in the opening games of this one.

926~~~
Not sure really, he always seems the same to me - weird positioning, great at last ditch tackles, done that 2 seasons ago, season ago and now. Difference is now that he's played constantly at CB and he's not thrown around RB, CB, CDM which is definitely helping him out.

927~~~
Not the thread for a Phil Jones discussion but IMO he's looked a lot better this season than last. Playing in his preferred position will obviously help but he's put some poor performances in at CB in the past too, especially last season.

928~~~
God I hate this place at times. I know loyalty is fleeting in football but it's horrible to hear our fans being hyper critical over a player who has done wonders for us in his short time at the club. Why can't we just get behind players who aren't at their very best for a change. I love RVP and love what he did for us in 2012-13 (singlehandedly won us #20).  He hasn't found that top form again this season (which striker has) but I will support him until it genuinely needs addressing. He is a big character for us, a leader, has balls and is very clever on the ball. Just give him time like how we are giving Falcao time to adjust.

929~~~
I think the reason Falcao keeps coming off rather then RVP is because we're being very cautions with managing his comeback. Both of them visibly tire after 60/70 minutes, but bringing Falcao off makes more sense considering his injury. I don't think its favoritism, not yet anyway.

930~~~
Very difficult for him, and Falcao, in this tactic. He covers too many spaces when defending, and considering that we defended too much the last two games, he wasn’t very good. The tactic is simple, when we lose the ball, the front 3 RVp left, Mata central and Falcao right, are forming a defensive 3 man line upfront. But when we have the ball RVP must be in the box,


RVP, like Falcao, should play in the box, as a real 9 like he did his first year, leading the front and be closer to the defense. He’s not, not anymore, the kind of player who will run 11Km per game chasing opponents. I know that the diamond formation is made to play the stars together, but I don’t think that he’s used the best way, nor Falcao, nor Wazza, not Mata.

931~~~
How many are actually here? 
Two starters on Sunday actually started van Gaal's first game, let alone started Moyes' last game.

932~~~
Jones, Smalling, Evans, RVP, Valencia, Young, Ando, Fletcher and Fellaini. Carrick has not played yet. It's really hard to say if any single one of them is doing better than last season at the moment ( bar those question marks above Jones' head that Pogue mentioned ). I intentionally skipped trio of Rafael, Rooney and DDG as they've done 'ok-ish' last season.

Not to mention that Kagawa and Cleverley were 'not working under Moyes' and were touted to be 'LVG players' just to get sold in the end. Not the thread for it though, just a small digression from me.

933~~~
This was on Reddit today: <a class="externalLink" href="http://imgur.com/a/AgLhy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/AgLhy</a>

I'd disregard this season, as it just started, but it does suggest that he's aging pretty normally for a top striker, rather than in some freakish Totti manner. He's still wonderful on the ball, but he seems to be having more trouble getting open than he used to. 

I still think he'd score a high number of goals as a 9 up front on a good team, but with Rooney and Falcao here and younger, we're really not a great fit anymore for him or vice-versa, I don't think. For example, if he was at Arsenal or Spurs, you'd back him to hit 20 assuming he was the penalty taker, right?

Not being unloyal. He's been a great player and he won us the league, but I'm starting to think he will be coming off the bench a lot for us once Rooney is back. Still a crucial role, but one he might not like.

934~~~
If this continues all season, I will be very disappointed if van Gaal to let him be moved on. Some will say he has been fine, but he simply hasn't, he has been more of a hindrance. 2 goals in 6 starts isn't good enough for this club.

935~~~
The more I see/read about him the more I am thinking he's declining at a decent rate. I wish we had kept Welbeck because RvP will possibly be finished as a starter very soon.

936~~~
Wow, thanks for posting that. Thats a pretty steep decline since his pinnacle. Just shows how amazing he was if he's still actually pretty good compared to most other players standards.

937~~~
Wow, actually? His goal record for us is phenomenal already. I think we're just being critical of people on here lately because its what we've gotten used to over the past year. RvP has been good and to say we need to move him on or he's not at the quality we require anymore is just far from the truth. He's probably the best striker in the league on form. He isn't at his very best but his contribution is still above average and he deserves to be in the team most games.

938~~~
The reasons people are struggling to get behind him is because it pretty much feels like we are playing with 10 men for all RVP has contributed this season also it's hard to get behind him when he is effectively keeping mata out of the team too. The only reason mata is on the bench is because van gaal hasn't got the balls to drop RVP. When RVP plays mata misses out as Rooney then has to play 10 role which he certainly isn't better than mata at. 

Rooney-Falcao 
      Mata

I'm pretty certain That's what every United fan wants to see and that <b>should</b> be our first choice front 3.

Also he doesn't need time, he hasn't just joined our club and isnt in a settling in period like Falcao is, the guy has been here awhile now plus he has the bonus of having a manager that he knows basically like a father, he's worked with him in the past for holland so he knows all about van gaal so where is this give him time coming from? 

There's simply no excuse for his average start to the season. He needs a spell on the bench if he wants a place he should fight for it.

939~~~
Why do you think, just because he is from the premier league, he is already settled, he has a father figure in van gaal that he can't go out of form or have bad games? Why should he sit on the bench when Rooney gets to play in spite of having a pathetic first touch and has spurts where he needs games to get back in form?

In his 10 years at United, Rooney himself has had stinkers of games, bad games, pathetic games as well as games where he has shone in an excellent way.

So if he gets to play even if he is out of form then Van Persie should be afforded the same privilege. United are playing well and Van Persie just won the game for United against West Ham inspite of playing badly. 

Benching him is not help Van Gaal. Playing him and helping him get back in form will surely do.

Rooney should be competing with Mata for the no 10 spot and if Mata is better than him and tough luck for Rooney. He can be benched <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

940~~~
Definitely, a player can score the one goal in a match but still miss a couple of chances or feck up a few great moves, like he is doing these days, he won't be said to have played well. Given the state of our defense - inexperience and currently ravaged by injuries - we need our attack to be on top of it's game and put games out of sight damaging the opposition's morale. We could and should have gone to half time leading by three or four goals (he is not solely to blame for that) and from Everton's perspective it would have been game over.
Van Persie's form is starting to concern me and moreso the fact that he seems immune to spending time on the bench. If it continues you wonder how long it will be before the rest of the squad notices and if it won't be a source of conflict in the not too distant future.

941~~~
He's a pretty good striker though.

942~~~
Van Persie missing easy chances is not something new you know? He has a history of missing sitters even in his brief career with us so I am not sure why people are pointing it out now.

His poor form has been exaggerated.

943~~~
He'll score against Chelsea and you guys will all love him again, fickle as feck

944~~~
Rooney has been in better form than Van Persie so far, but I don't see what Mata or Falcao have done to deserve playing instead of Van Persie. Falcao hasn't been clinical to put it mildly, and Mata has shown a lack of ideas. Your statement that LvG hasn't got the balls to drop him is just dumb. LvG has dropped important players before and has even dropped Van Persie in favour of Huntelaar, not even a top player. 

What fans want to see and what should be done are generally two different things.

945~~~
And in this case what the supporters want to see happen is exactly what we should see happen. Robin is slowing our play down quite considerably and doesn't appear dynamic enough to partner another centre forward. 

You rightly point out that Rooney is in the best form, and for me, Falcao looks to offer that bit more dynamism. The Mata, Rooney, Falcao trio is more balanced, allowing each of the three players to play in their best positions.

946~~~
The fact about RVP is that he’s not creating as many chances as he could or he should. To me there are three reasons to that:


-  The tactics doesn’t suit him as we’re playing to deep for him. He’s not the type of N9 who loves coming from deep like Benzema, Aguero etc. I think I is much much more efficient when the team plays higher on the pitch and when he’s found in the box. Moyes’s game was based on weak wingers, weak midfielders and he wasn’t well served. This year we seems to play again too deep, and the diamond formation force him to defend far from his favorite zone, so that’s why I think he’s not good enough this year


-  I really think that he begins to tired a little. 3 years ago he could beat a man and place a terrific shot (cf his goal against us at Emirates). This year I can’t see him winning a duel, and scoring outside the box. It’s not his flair that lack, but more a physical state IMO.


-  Last point, I think that the team doesn’t play for him. We’re more focused on Di Maria and maybe Wazza as the two playmakers, but with them and another striker, RVP is not the main target… He will have less important ball to play and less situation


The question is that 12 month ago; we could all imagine RVP as the main weapon to win us the league. Is it disbelief from us or in just that he’s lost his level? I would think that he’s not on his better position and his better form to fire us to the title, and once again, I like the diamond formation against weaker teams (to score and accommodate our superstar) but in big games, we really should go for 4-3-3 and play either RVP or Falcao to balance the team much more, which will benefit them for sure

947~~~
2 questions for me: is he not fully fit / out of form or declining, and would LvG drop him or not (especially after making him captain last weekend)

948~~~
We aren't even a quarter of the way through the season. Have some faith! The service he got last season was atrocious. It continually amazes me how quickly people right off players on here.

949~~~
He's got better players behind him this season though. And whilst he's scored that isn't my main concern. His all round performances haven't been good for a while, for us last season, this season and the Dutch NT.

950~~~
Every player in the world has average spells. It doesn't really need an excuse, it's just football. I don't want to see RvP dropped tbh, he's quality and is as capable as any player in the league to produce a moment of jaw-dropping magic from nothing. I love having that in the team. But I trust in van Gaal to make the right call either way.

951~~~
I'd go so far as to say that at his peak he was more capable than almost anyone in world football of a moment of magic from nowhere. His volleys and ridiculous flicks, out of this world. So many of his goals for us in 2012/13 were basically out of nothing, which is why you appreciate them even more, because that wreck of a team created shit all chances for him a lot of the time. You don't really get that sense of being able to do that out of nothing these days though. Hopefully it's just a poor spell and we'll see some goals like that again.

952~~~
** mate 

His volley against Villa, or injury time equalizer at West Ham in Cup... His free kick at City, his goal against N'castle reaching 3-3, his late goal against Sotton  .... That's why he was magic his first year and what we miss so much, a man who can change an average result in a good one

Remember also that during his poor spell his frist year (until that penalty at Stoke) he was awfull because his hip injury that time. He's very fragile, and it seems that he build his fitness very very very slowly.... He needs game time to produce this magic.... But do we have time ?

953~~~
He has not turned into a bad player over the last few months. And he has not been that bad this season either, just nowhere as good as he actually is.

Maybe LvG wants him to play himself into top form until we play the big boys as he knows how brilliant and devastating an in form RvP can be.

It must be something like this because I can't think of any other reason. Not having the balls to drop him just doesn't make sense. He subbed him off when he was his captain at the WC, so why would he not do it here? I doubt RvP would moan instantly, and even if he did, so what? I doubt RvP has so much influence in the dressing room that everyone would take his side. 

It can only be that LvG thinks he will reach his best form sooner rather than later.

954~~~
6 games in....new manager...new system and an unsettled side....and people are writing off a player with 50 goals in 80 odd starts for us.

955~~~
I know Rooney is no saint and has bad games but even when Rooney plays bad he still offers more than RVP currently does especially defensively which is one of our weaker points currently. I agree with van gaal when he says Rooney is undroppable, Falcao needs game time to get match fitness and more settled in and he's getting better each game. 

As for mata being dropped then that's unacceptable considering he's scored 9 goals and assisted 5 since he joined us remember under Moyes he played out of position too. Whenever he plays 10 he generally plays well. 

For the best balance and most effective frontline then we need Rooney - Falcao with mata behind, that means RVP will be benched and then we'll see how committed he is to getting back in the first 11.

956~~~
Why are many of you so desperate for him to be benched/dropped? Falcao hasn't really set the world alight and is still building up his fitness, Rooney won't play #9 very often under LVG and RVP has not been as terrible as most on here are making him out to be. The way it's going now, he'll score a hattrick and still be criticized. He's out of form for HIS standards, and it has nothing to do with him "not being arsed". Play him into form, he has earned the credit.

957~~~
I think he's just getting older and his overall is slowly and logically decreasing.

958~~~
Apart from all but one game so far this season. If we're going to be picking a player based on how many goals he's scored for Utd then it will be Van Persie playing not Mata.

959~~~
I agree with your sentiment, but when there are players not getting a look in who deserve a shot, that's when the frustration kicks in.

960~~~
When we signed him I convinced myself that all the injuries in the early part of his career might mean he's got a lower mileage than most players his age, so would maintain the same level of performance well into his 30s. Of course, it's also possible that the exact opposite is the case. Endless rehab can be bloody hard work.

961~~~
I don't think that we'll ever see the consistent player that fired us to the title two years ago again, however he was openly talked about as the best striker on the planet around that time. I do still think he's capable of performances like the one that literally earned us a place in the CL quarter final last season. That glorious hatrick. For that reason alone, I think it'd be very risky to drop him.

962~~~
People see a player having a drop in form for a few months and instantly draw conclusions about him, "he will never be the same", "lost his pace", "he will never be as fit as in 2013". Reality is, the season just started, players just came back from the world cup and pre-season, we are just clicking in as a team, is way too early into the season to draw conclusions about a players form.

963~~~
In Rooney's absence one of those attacking players had to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the team, and against Everton it was RvP. I thought it was a captain's performance. He wasn't sensational by any means, but he battled hard and fought for the team. It stifled his goal threat somewhat but I still thought he played an important role in our victory.

964~~~
Even though I'm not completely sure RVP will get back to his very best, this is true. I remember people revising how important he was to us in his first season a few months ago and saying that it was a mistake signing him. If he was to find his best form again, you wouldn't see people saying that. Granted, it wouldn't surprise me if the guy has had his best days, but I think that some are writing him off a little too quickly. Suppose that's always the nature of things though.

965~~~
I'd be pleasantly surprised to see him regain his form of a couple of years ago. Don't think it will happen unfortunately.

966~~~
Except that he was like this for the entirety of last season too.

You can bleat on that it was under Moyes and the team was a mess but it doesn't change the fact that Robin is older and has been struggling with injuries. To completely disregard the physical ramifications of being past the accepted peak after an injury ravaged career is quite a blind attitude.

He's still a great player and will score goals but I just don't see how he's going to magically regain pace, sharpness, mobility and play his way into better form.

967~~~
State of this thread lol. He might as well retire on some logic in here.

968~~~
It isn't a new manager for him though. And like I said it isn't just this season, it has been a while now.

969~~~
He seemed so different compared to two seasons ago when he was banging in goals for fun. But annoyed me most was not his lack of pace or anything but his constant asking for ball even if he is in a very bad position to receive in the first place. Look at Di Maria's goal against Everton, he was surrounded by players but still signal to Mata for the ball.

970~~~
He still did quite well too last season though. Perhaps not as good performance wise and he missed a lot more games, but he still managed a respectable goals tally over the course of the season. It's not as if he was terrible.

971~~~
You're definitely entitled to your opinion but IMO to write a player of RVP's quality so quickly is just folly. He's started six times for us this season and hey, he might have a terrible season but you've gone way too soon.

It seems as though these days with players being bought and sold so easily that any sort of form drop just isn't tolerated by fans and the media alike. It's inevitable players will fluctuate in their form because they are human and that's what happens. And it's a bad mentality to have, it's the type of mentality that would've seen Evra sold six months after he arrived at United and likewise with De Gea.

By the way I agree his form hasn't been great. Just don't agree he's done b

972~~~
Hopefully he will score a few goals for holland to regain his confidence back. Who are they playing in the qualifier?

973~~~
Few days ago I was watching the season review of last season and what struck me was rvp wasn't as bad as I thought under moyes. He was still scoring decent amount of goals, majority of which are high quality goals mind you. 

But I do get the impression now that he is carrying some sort of injury for a while now

It's pretty clear to me that he's turned the corner so to say. His goal/shot ratio has improved or is roughly the same though, which is good. Still early days, and he might turn it around, but the signs are not great.

976~~~
He was lone striker at Arsenal, then a 9 and a half in 12/13, then played for Moyes in 13/14 and now finally plays alongside two other worldclass strikers, all of whom are vying for the same space in the penalty box. Some of his numbers are obviously going to be affected in those circumstances.

The biggest question is over whether he can improve his game outside the penalty box, because that's where he's increasingly going to find himself this season. I worry if he has the pace to be a threat from there.

977~~~
I think nearly every United player has a statistical decrease from 12/13 to 13/14 and the statistics from 14/15 are after 7 games, from which we played 4 games with the whole team (Falcao, Blind ...) Statistics are an important tool in todays football, but you always have to consider the circumstances they were taken under and the Moyes season hopefully was a one of. 

He is certainly ageing, how couldn't he? But it's so stupid to suggest that it is only downhill from now on and that we should get rid of him. RVP is still a brilliant striker and certainly a player who is smart enough to adjust his game, especially considering he hasn't really relied on pace anyway. His game is all about intelligent movement, good technique and smart finishing. He is still deadly around the box and will only get better in the coming weeks. He will score some beautiful and vital goals this season and makes some people on here eat their words, no doubt about that.

978~~~
Stats show it, RVP is done! RVP out!

979~~~
SAF knew how to get 110% out of his strikers, SAF being a forward in his younger days, plus along with working with so many world class forwards in his managerial career, knew exactly how to get the best out of RVP

Its safe to say, that weve seen his best, plus under SAF he was the "main man" our main striker, so our play normally built arond rooney, was built around rvp, so obviously whole team , was providing him usually solely with ammunition

Whereas now there is no main striker, its a clusterfeck of RVP, Rooney, and Falcao, they`e all in each others way

980~~~
13/14 was a shit season for everybody, not only RVP.

981~~~
The other question is whether or not we should keep relying on RVP to score so many goals, and with players like DiMaria and Falcao here I think the clear answer is that we shouldn't.  RVP does have the ability to create goals that we haven't really seen in his time here (or anywhere?) and maybe taking some of that goalscoring burden off of him and bringing playmaking to his game would help get another few years out of him.

I'm encouraged somewhat by seeming him trying to link up with Falcao in the first games together.  I don't know if RVP will be happy with doing that for the long term but it looks like it could be a great pairing.

982~~~
Why shouldn't we rely on a striker to score goals? We should've kept Welbeck if we wanted that. I don't know about him looking like he's looking capable of 'playmaking', his passing and build-up play has been worse than Falcao's this season. 

It doesn't, at all. He's constantly occupying the same positions Falcao wants to take up, and he looks as lethargic and disinterested to drop back as ever.

983~~~
It wasn't even really a shit season for him, though. Not a standout season, but it was a decent one, perhaps one that can be considered as better than it generally would be because a lot of our team really was shit.

984~~~
Its simple,hes a striker,that in a year or two should be dropping deeper.

Fecking move around the boxand bury what WILL be created for him,hes convinced now hes a nine and half which is half the problem.Yeah hes lost a lot of directness and i think thats Vangaals fault,i.e this ls/rs role he had for his national team.Easily rectified,just play him as a fecking striker,yeah work ethic ,yadda yadda,hes flair,dont make hm work so hard.

I hope he stays and becomes a new Sheringham type.

985~~~
I just don't see it in van Persie to play there. Obviously he has great technique, and he's an intelligent player, but I just don't see that ability to get close to others in that tight area and link-up play - which usually comes so naturally to others.
For me, he just looks at his best when left to play on his own, and the more people in and around him, the worse he looks.

He'd do a decent job due to his technique, but I do't see him thriving there, like many do.
There's usually a hint of that ability to play with a partner, but van Persie's never shown that.

Best thing for him, in my opinion, would be to move to a slower league where he can play up top on his own. Still think he'd do well as a no.9 in a slower system, if he's left to get on with playing as the sole striker.

986~~~
That header seem like a distant memory now, he should be dropped for a 4-3-3 with Falcao as a lone striker. Think we'd smash teams with this sytem.

987~~~
He just doesn't seem to getting involved anything like as much as in his first season for us, both at club and international level. In his first season here I remember being pleasantly surprised by just how involved he was in the build-up and how his touch was always fantastic. Very rarely was he the cause of an attack breaking down.

Now he mostly seems to stand around upfront, occasionally reminding you he's on the pitch by getting caught offside or having a heavy touch and losing possession.

988~~~
Reminds of Shevchenko at Chelsea right now, his legs just don't seem there.

989~~~
How did he play against Iceland? Anyone watch the game?

990~~~
Terrible quite honestly, typical RVP performance, reading a few Dutch columns a lot of Dutch people want hiddink and RVP out of the team. 

Pretty much how most united fans feel about him currently the majority want RVP to be benched. I'm not sure exactly what's happened to him but he is a shadow of the player he was when he signed for us. Lost all his pace, seems very lazy but selfish too.

991~~~
Some of the criticism is a bit OTT, but understandable, nonetheless.

It's been a <b>very</b> long while now, since RvP has been at his best and with 2 world class strikers to rotate him with, he should be dropped.

Even last season, he only showed up in patches. Seems at this present moment, LVG is reluctant to drop his (former) NT Captain.

Let's hope the persistence pays off, sooner rather then later. Either that, or we should drop him.

992~~~
Hiddink already getting criticism? Suppose the Dutch are really struggling.

I take it Depay is injured? Saw Lens play both matches recently.

993~~~
Yeah, alongside Vlaar and of course Strootman, but they are really underperforming. Even their win was very very sloppy.

994~~~
Yeah, I think Strootman is a huge miss as they just don't have anyone of that quality to replace him. Still not sure why they're persisting playing Blind at LB - especially in a 4-3-3. He could do a job next to de Jong in midfield. (unless their depth at LB is pretty shit?).

Can see Hiddink being under a ton of pressure, especially if they huff and puff through qualification.

995~~~
Feck.

996~~~
While a lot of these comments are true, let's put this together with how our team have been, I wouldn't take last season with any real conviction, I have said for a while people over-reach with him, he's a classy player, but his effectiveness will be different. He's a very static option, I hate to say this, but he currently reminds me more of a selfish Berbatov unfortunately, I'd love to see him get back to his best, but I feel his best is now behind us, but that's not to say he wouldn't get back to a level where he is a very good EPL striker, as let's not forget, his "best", was one of the top 5 strikers in the world.

997~~~
Even as one of his biggest fans, Its getting quite worrying now. 

For all his injuries last season, when he played he didn't look anywhere near this bad. Maybe its those injuries that have just finally taken its toll on his body?

998~~~
I keep seeing people asking for him to be dropped for Falcao or Mata...  But what have those 2 done in this start of the season that warrants a place in the team over RVP? They have been at least as shit as RVP if not worse so I don't really get it? The only one who can keep his head high from our forwards is Rooney and he isn't setting the world on fire either, tbh.

The only player who can have the right to claim a starting spot over him(or Mata/Falcao for that matter) si Janujaz, imo, who performed really well in the reserves and deserves his chance.

999~~~
Falcao come's very high profile and hasn't really had a chance yet, Mata outperformed RVP since Mata joined, agree about Januzaj though and I'd like to see Mata up top. I'd like to see:

1000~~~
That is very debatable, VERY

1001~~~
Are you suggesting that united fans are as stupid as the Dutch people and as spiteful as the Dutch press?

1002~~~
How so?

1003~~~
Falcao has been significantly better than RVP, they have similar stats but in the hold up/build up, Falcao has been much better.

1004~~~
Mata wasn't THAT good last season and RVP wasn't THAT bad.
RVP scored vitally important goals last season and had a better scoring rate than the previous season.
Mata scored a few goals but his performances were also not that good, especially when stuck out on the left, played a few very good games after Moyes left.

Now to this season, Mata hasn't done much and neither has RVP, both have a few goals and been involved in play that has lead to goals and chances.

I don't really see how anyone can say Mata has been better, that's not me saying RVP has been better either btw. They have both been a bit meh IMO

1005~~~
Yeah, he does.

And we could manage to get by with Berbatov because he still had that ability/desire to link up and make runs off other people. He enjoyed creating goals as much as scoring them.

van Persie's got Berbatov's static 'ball to my feet' nature, but he's not even looking to get close to people and link up. He's not showing the same inventiveness in his play.
He's just making his own runs and playing like a solo striker.

1006~~~
You must be joking, surely... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1007~~~
No I'm not.

1008~~~
You have a bit of a contradiction there, you say he has a static 'ball to my feet' nature, then go on to say he is making his own runs like a solo striker.

Anyway that's a mute point. He has not been playing particularly well, but the forward line is going to need time to gel, none of them are playing particularly well. Rooney is the only player playing above average out of the 3/4 IMO, however we are still creating chances and scoring goals.

He is actually linking up with others too, he has linked up with the right sided players on a couple of occasions, one infact ended up in the creation of the first goal against west ham, he also had some good link up play with Falcao in the QPR game.

I think some of us fans just need a little patience to be honest.

1009~~~
His runs are exclusively coming short to receive it to feet, or running into the box to finish a ball played into him.

That's not even a major issue. It's the fact that he doesn't turn or go forward when he receives it, he slows play down, he doesn't seem interested in doing much other than laying it off and getting into the box for a finish.
Few attempts to play with any inventiveness between the lines, or create for anyone else, which could at least be said of Berbatov.

And that's not such a big deal.. as a solo striker.

1010~~~
I definitely see your point but would argue RVP's meh has been consistently worse than Mata's. Bar the Olympiakos game RVP has just been consistently poor since the start of the year, whereas at least Mata has had a number of very good performances (after a shocking start).

1011~~~
Not really. Mata was our best player from February until the end of the season and has outperformed Van Persie so far this season, albeit that isn't saying much. Both should be playing a lot better, however Van Persie is the one playing games every week.

I watched a bit of the Netherlands last night and Robin's game is extremely worrying. He slows everything down; the direct opposite of the way our others attackers are inclined to play.

1012~~~
His runs are not always into the box or short, he is actually making a number of runs down the right hand channel, receiving the ball and then getting the ride sided players into the game (seems to be a specific tactic with Falcao doing the same down the left)

I've seen him this season take the ball and drive forward into the box, once he should have had one a penalty (I think against Sunderland).

Don't get me wrong I don't believe he has been playing well and should be playing better, but I find the micro criticism of his game a bit too much, especially when people are saying he isn't doing certain things he is actually doing.

1013~~~
I really don't see this to be honest.

1014~~~
Agree 100%

Have you even watched our games?

Falcao is new to our team so has had to have a settling in period but he has surpassed RVP this year already in terms of performances. We might aswell be playing with a man down up front for all RVP has done for us this year Falcao has offered way more to the team in terms of hold up play and actually dropping deep to help out. RVP just hovers up the pitch getting offside all the time. Plus he is selfish when he does get the ball.

Apart from that 1st season RVP where he was on fire he hasn't performed consistently well for ages now.

Not at all, you're words not mine. I'm saying many Dutch and many utd fans know RVP can't do a job anymore like he used to. Simple as.

1015~~~
Looks to me that it's you the one who didn't watch the games. Falcao was shit every game except West Ham, even there RVP was better. About his hold up play... don't make me laugh.

Surely there is a lot more to come from him, but to suggest he was good so far is just ridiculous. Same shit applies to RVP, I'm not saying he performed better, but to suggest that Falcao should be ahead of him on performance related reasons it's just stupid because he didn't really show anything so far.

1016~~~
Grumbling about RvP, grumbling about Rooney, grumbling about Falcao, grumbling about Mata . . . 

We're like an old man with two parma hams under his arms, who's crying because he hasn't got any bread (© The Sopranos).

1017~~~
If his performances don't pick up soon then he will have to be benched. We have gotten by well enough against average sides but if he is still poor against Chelsea and City then we'll lose. Can't afford to carry anyone in those matches.

1018~~~
I would be very surprised to see us start two forwards against Chelsea and City - especially the former - irrespective of the players form. If van Persie continues to disappoint against West Brom and then start alongside Falcao against Chelsea than van Gaal will indisputably be showing unwarranted preferential treatment toward RvP. Fair enough if he want to build his match fitness, sharpness and form in the games so far, but there comes a time when a player simply has to be benched despite his reputation.

1019~~~
van Persie still shows his quality up front as he still scores goals for us. However, his all-round play has worsened as he's becoming less physically capable to play a freer forward role. Sure, Falcao's done a better job than van Persie has in holding up the ball and in linking up with teammates, but playing in this role has only gotten him 1 goal.

Still, though, van Persie can score goals for us in just about any situation (of course, until he stops scoring goals in the 2nd half of the season), so he can be relied upon to bring us goals even when we're not performing that well. However, his all-round play has deteriorated, and since we're not playing with a capable right-wing player in our team, van Persie's not going to be as effective, and this will affect Falcao's performance up front along with making us heavily rely on Rafael for width on the right side.

I still believe van Persie can regain that sharpness that made him so good in the 2012/13 season. However, at this moment, it doesn't seem to be the case, and I don't have so much hope of him regaining it against West Brom.

1020~~~
It's funny everyone is moaning about Falcao, Rooney, RVP and Mata, yet we are still scoring goals. Even with di Maria having an off day against West Ham we scored twice and might have scored more had Rooney not been sent off. They are linking well, making good movement and holding the ball well. We know they can do better though, and they will. All this concern though, is very over the top. If we stop scoring goals, then we should really be worried.

1021~~~
Hey, don't call me stupid! 

<a class="username" data-user="82307, @dannyrhinos89" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82307/">@dannyrhinos89</a> is right though. Really a lot of Dutch people want RVP out to make room for Huntelaar. They are saying this since before WC of 2010 started and even when RVP was a class above any other striker in England they still wanted Huntelaar to start because he has a better average (despite RVP being the national topscorer). Some people even claim that with Huntelaar the Netherlands would have won the WC of 2010 and 2014 <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

RVP is disliked by many Dutch people, he had an attitude problem while playing at Feyenoord. He left the Dutch league early, he talks with a dutch/moraccan accent and he made a hand gesture against Huntelaar during the game against Kazachstan. He also refused to talk the the media several times.

It's a bit like Seedorf.. he was also disliked but after he 'retired' from international football people started to appreciate him. Personally i don't rate Huntelaar that much so i hope RVP keeps playing for the national team but he does need to improve.

1022~~~
Really?  How did that come about?

1023~~~
Probably because he grew up in a neighborhood of people of Moroccan descent.

1024~~~
That explains why he has a Moroccan wife.

1025~~~
Not liking someone because of their accent is a bit silly.

1026~~~
Haha,  just last week I read the English couch talking about Rooney's accent and it becoming a deal. Even here you still have people talking about Rooney and him being a scourse and his accent etc. 

So why is it hard to believe that Dutch people will have issues with RvP having an accent?

1027~~~
It explain nothing guyz. If he had another accent, it's more due to Rotterdam more than the people our decendent in his town...

His wife was born in Holland and she is Dutch like him, with no accent...

I just think that his supposed Morocan accent is wrong. 

Maybe people dislike him because he has a wife with other origins and probably because he always had a difficult caracter

1028~~~
It adds up.. they don't like him because they want Huntelaar in the starting line up. Because of this his 'haters' (for lack of a better word) try to find all kinds of things to criticize him. Also if i read Dutch forum, i believe 99.9% doesn't want him as a captain anymore.. everyone wants Robben.

I just can't understand why many Dutch fans don't rate him. His performances aren't that bad. He has to play with Robben, who always cuts inside and shoots in our normaal 4-3-3 system, Lens (hopefully Depay in the near future) who also cuts inside and Sneijder who prefers to shoot instead of pass to RVP.

1029~~~
I think it's silly that people dislike Rooney's accent too. It just seems like an unnecessary characteristic to hold against someone. It isn't hard to believe that people do it though, I just think it's an irrelevant issue.

1030~~~
Your assumption that Dutch fans actually rate players is wrong. 90% of the Dutch fans dont do rating, they just do liking and hating. And most of them like those who they are told to like by the media, who feed them with facts, not so very factual stories, selective stats and suggestive choice of words and some glimpse of pseudo-football knowledge to confirm that those who they like best are also the best players for a certain position.

The Dutch national team is owned by the countryside and the media in a perverted collaboration. It's not entirely predictable who will be picked as the player who can't do anything wrong, and who is picked as the scapegoat, but generally the bigmouthed selfish countryboy with no selfcriticism and is not that talented has a good chance of beeing the fans favourite, especially when he claims fame and fortune hasn't changed him.

This wouldn't be such a problem if the managers always were like Van Gaal, but most of them give in to the pressure to play the most popular ones. Van Gaal didn't give an inch, he managed the popularity problem, but in his own way. So Van Gaal got all the stick, lots of it. But they waited and waited for their chance to have a go at Van Persie. It started the WC, immediately after his first not so spectacular match, and went for the kill last week, even before the first match. It has only softened because Hiddink made such a mess and is under fire.

1031~~~
Now watch him score against both Chelsea and City.

1032~~~
Nobody's questioning whether van Persie will still score goals, and still score some spectacular goals.
It's his overall game and suitability to our style of play (and future style of play) that's being questioned.

1033~~~
Really don't know what's happening with him.

His lack of effort is most worrying thing for me personally, as if he's completely exhausted yet he's had enough break and time to rest.

Perhaps he needs kick in arse and place on the bench, since this 'let's play him into form' clearly doesn't work.

1034~~~
I doubt LVG will bench him though if his poor form continues - you can only hope that he has the guts and distance to do so

1035~~~
Fair enough if he's making an effort to change it up and link things up. But to me it just doesn't seem natural to him, or like a good fit.

Was looking at some old Arsenal compilations and it's so clear that he's a solo striker who does best being given the ball in a quite isolated position, using his superb touch to steer the traffic, waiting for runners, and laying it off before going forward for the finish. It's what made him the player he was at Arsenal.

He had great, nippy runners either side of him and coming from deep, but he was given the space to do his thing.
He also had the legs to do the job superbly, challenge for the ball, beat a man more often and occasionally move the ball up the field himself.

These days he still plays like a solo striker, but doesn't even appear to have the legs to do it as well. And then when you put another no.9 in and around his space, it just detracts from him even further.
And then, with an ultra-attacking no.10 like Mata or Rooney thrown in, it's just so far away from the role he played at Arsenal, which is what brought the best out of him.

I don't even think playing him in his old Arsenal role as a solo striker with wide men would work that well any more. Because he looks lethargic, less willing to run, and that burst of ability to carry the ball forward that he had seems gone.

I just don't see an ideal role for him in the side.

1036~~~
So you didn't bother watching the compilations when he was playing LM for Arsenal then I take it..
How a player plays depends on the tactics being deployed, his later years at Arsenal he was deployed as a solo Striker so he is obviously going to look like one.

EDIT: My point is anyway that it is a new system, Falcao also doesn't look comfortable in it yet and as for Mata well...

The forward line needs time to get used to the new setup, then I'll judge, however I am not too worried as even though they are well versed yet we are creating chances and scoring goals, and so is RVP...

1037~~~
He wasn't at his best when he played wide left or wide right. He's also changed as a player.
It has very little bearing on what he can do here now as a striker.

My point about being a solo striker is that putting another no.9 next to him and a second striker behind him is so far away from what had him playing his best.

I don't see a partnership striker in him, and he's lost bits of what made him a great solo striker at Arsenal. He's still a solo striker, but who doesn't have the legs he did before.

1038~~~
He was voted Arsenals player of the season playing wide left...
Everyone is too quick to write players off after some off form, lets see what he can do once the new system beds in (we have only played 4 or so games with this formation)

1039~~~
He still became a better player as a solo striker. And he clearly can't play that wide role any more, so it has no bearing on what he can do as a striker today.

I'm not writing him off, and I think he'll still score goals. But I don't think he fits the team, or really ever has, even when he was bailing us out every other game two years ago. And I think he's even more limited now.

1040~~~
Says a lot about Dutch attitude towards moroccans (get your spelling right first though).

1041~~~
Scousers though...it's truly off-putting hearing them speak. Like having your head banged against a blackboard whilst someone is scraping their nails down it.

1042~~~
To be honest, he should be benched. At this particular moment, he is in dreadful form for his standards. I'm being hard on him because I know how good he can be. He should be benched for now in order to find his motivation again I think, he still has some quality years left in him. He looks out of shape, and severely lacks motivation. Even Falcao looks better than him, and he is still adapting to the team.

1043~~~
Yep I had the opportunity to sleep with a underwear model but as soon as I heard the scouse accent I couldn't bring myself to go through with it. It actually destroyed any sexual thoughts I had about her.

1044~~~
Bullshit.

1045~~~
Unfortunately its not. I was doing some modelling at the time aswell so hung around with those sort of people. but she was very well known in the scene.

1046~~~
Crouch's missus?

1047~~~
Should start every game for us, wasnt worse than Mata or Falcao. Just because everybody likes Mata and we got a new shiny striker, they want him dropped. Like i said Mata and Falcao werent significantly better. I like his determination and tackles he showed in the last few games. Now that Rooney is missing, who should play instead of him. We dont even have any leaders, Robin isnt the best one out there, but at least he has experience as a captain. The only one i could imagine to replace him would be Januzaj in the Robben role, but that wont happen. So lets play RvP.

<i>"Don't cha wish your striker was RVP? Scoring goals as easy as 1-2-3? Don't cha....</i>

1048~~~
I'm not particularly bothered about the leadership/experience aspect of his game since I don't think we'd struggle without that, but I'll agree that I'm not too bothered about him continuing to play. He's been fairly average and gotten a couple of games. Decent return, and hopefully he'll improve. If he doesn't, and someone like Mata improves and earns his first team place, we can maybe switch it up then. If LVG wants to persist with two strikers and an attacking mid though, Rooney's best for in behind, which automatically puts Falcao/RVP up top.

<span style="font-size: 22px">Is Robin van Persie in terminal decline at Manchester United?</span>

<a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/pitchside-europe/is-unrecognisable-robin-van-persie-in-terminal-decline-at-manchester-united-111142427.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blog...l-decline-at-manchester-united-111142427.html</a>

1050~~~
No.

1051~~~
Just like United in 2006, Rob.

1052~~~
That's not why people want him dropped.

1053~~~
Watch him score against Chelsea and Manchester City.

1054~~~
Indeed.

1055~~~
I wouldn't mind him brushing up on the offside rule, doesn't seem to grasp the concept of it these days.

1056~~~
VP shows the fickle nature of fans perfectly.
2 years ago, people were madly overhyping him. This season, people are criminally underhyping him

1057~~~
well it is not the main argument, people still like them more than him and thats a fact. Falcao and Mata havent shown anything near their best for us, just like RvP this season too, but for some reason they never get as heavy and unfairly criticised as RvP. I take Falcao out of the equation for obvious reasons, but Mata wasnt better than RvP in his games this season. If we talk about RvP being invisible, not looking fit or arsed, Mata behaves the same on the pitch. But i guess as long as he has his blogs and is a likeable fella, it doesnt matter. If it is between RvP and Mata, 80 percent will choose Mata, more for symphaty reasons than performances.

1058~~~
I don't know about this. Most posters are giving a fair and balanced assessment of his form I think.

1059~~~
Really? Two years ago he was one of the best players in the world and very possibly the best all round #9 in world football. That isn't "overhype," his goal-scoring record, ingenuity and general hold-up play throughout a match was brilliant at both Arsenal and United, with few forwards coming close to matching that. Ibrahimovic and Lewandowski, perhaps.

I honestly think most people are calling it right. He's still a great goalscorer, but he is slowing down our football and I think we'd be a better, more dynamic team at his expense.

1060~~~
If so, I'm part of that 20%. But it's rather unfair to say that those preferring Mata are doing so for sympathy reasons and the others are just being rational. I wouldn't frame it like that. Robin clearly is not playing as good as he was in his first season. Number of factors. But if he can get to that level again, emphasis on the if, he should clearly be an automatic choice in the first 11.
"It is also possible that, at 31, Van Persie has lost some pace, though we will not know for sure until he attempts to break into a sprint." <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ouch

1061~~~
Might score a wonder goal and his fan club  will laugh at those who have criticised at him but at the moment he is killing almost every move we make. Selfish and slow decision making. Great player but isn't playing great right now.

1062~~~
Is he finished, or is it still a knee jerk to assume so? he's showing no signs of recovering his form.

1063~~~
Besides not passing when he won the ball off Lescott, I thought he's been okay. Making better runs tonight than in past games.

1064~~~
Doesn't look like he's working, twice taken on the shot when the better option was the pass and didn't do well with the chance he did get. 

Hard to criticise too much, because he's got no one around him, but he's not doing whats required.

1065~~~
Looks sharper but still lacking that half yard to get onto the final ball to score the goal. We really need him to be firing In the second half because we have been poor in the final third. Either that or drop him for Falcao.

1066~~~
Age has taken its toll on him

1067~~~
Not sure what people expect him to do tonight. Beat an 8 man defence on his own? His movement has been good he's got himself into scoring positions. If Mata and Januzaj could be arsed giving a little support he might fin it a little easier.

1068~~~
That's what frustrates me the most about him.

1069~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1070~~~
You're assuming he would use them?

1071~~~
Poor decision making in the first half on more than one occasion but I'm gonna wait til full time to comment on RvP and his seemingly undroppable status.

I'll say this much - he needs to do something in the 2nd half.

1072~~~
Like he did for Di Maria's effort? Yeah, unfortunately they aren't paying much attention.

1073~~~
Did he have a look at goal then? I assume not, otherwise he would have shot even if others were in a better position. Even if that lost shot went in, it would have been a silly decision because it was extremely unlikely to come off and there were two or three guys in the box waiting.

1074~~~
Wrong thread but feckmyarsefellaini

1075~~~
Once again we're playing with 10 men because RVP isn't bothered enough to try, pathetic really.

1076~~~
Woodward needs to sell him off behind Van Gaal's back or something for LVG's own good.

1077~~~
This so far. It's ridiculous.

1078~~~
I'm assuming you're laughing at his performance...

1079~~~
It's getting to the point where I wish we'd never bought him. Sure, he won us a league title, but he's been in the way of players who would've been better for us in the long term since the day he arrived, and he hasn't contributed anything these last 15 months.

Doesn't even deserve to start. I have no idea how he cons his way into completing 90 minutes every game.

1080~~~
I've said he's finished for ages but his fanboys won't have it. He offers absolutely nothing anymore, we might aswell be playing with no striker.

1081~~~
Feck. Unlucky. Needs to come good these next twenty and needs to play with Falcao

1082~~~
Too far. Way way too far.

If he kept cocking up easy chances I'd agree with you, but the opportunities aren't there. If you aren't getting the supply, then what do you expect? 

If it were Falcao who had started and was struggling, the supply would be getting blamed rather than the striker.

1083~~~
Nope, the hysteria is too amusing. Robin´s playing a decent enough game tonight.

1084~~~
He's been terrible.

1085~~~
I don't see much hysteria other than someone who suggested that they wish we never bought him. He hasn't played nearly well enough today. Falcao has been on for barely any time and his hold up/ link-up play has been far better as well as his decision making. We have a great striker on the bench, if Robin (who is also a great striker) is not at his best he shouldn't be selected.

1086~~~
I'm presuming your playing on FIFA because he has been our worst player alongside Januzaj tonight

1087~~~
That's what we have been missing all game (Falcao's knock on).

1088~~~
nope.

1089~~~
Don't think he was any worse than anyone else either and that volley that hit the base of the post was top quality.  Certainly not worthy of the criticism he is getting.

1090~~~
Haha okay. You made some great points.

1091~~~
Not too bad a game from him. Had a very good effort, and looked a little bit better than he did in some of the previous games. Definitely some positives for him tonight.

1092~~~
Him starting above Falcao and actually managing to stay on the pitch 90 minutes every game this year is one of the biggest mysteries in the world. It is absolutely criminal.

1093~~~
Nah, didnt look good for me until Falcao came on. Then the two of them began to knock the ball on for one another and link up a little. Had a moment of almost genius, but that isn't good enough when you're keeping a Falcao out of the team.

1094~~~
I would not start him up front on his own again.

Our front pairing should be Falcao-Rooney first and Falcao-RVP second.

1095~~~
Dogshit.

1096~~~
Not a mystery at all. Van Gaal (perhaps wrongly) trusts him more than anyone else in the squad.

He's been complete shit, though.

1097~~~
He's not getting any better is he?

1098~~~
Quality footballer, he's just not effective anymore and hasn't been for a long time.

1099~~~
Can't be arsed. Joke.

1100~~~
It's like the manager's kid who's shit but still plays all the time, benching far better players.

1101~~~
He is playing like Hernandez with more shooting technique and less movement these days.

His hold up play and decision making has gone shit too along with his touch and he looks slow and soft.

1102~~~
Hasn't been world class for a long time now. We have turned in to arsenal I feel. Lots of good possession, good passing but no killer instinct. His body language is really pissing me off and it reminds me of how he looked before leaving Arsenal for us.

1103~~~
If it's a straight choice between him and Falcao then Falcao for me. Seems to get his body about a bit more successfully providing options for him to get it or second chance balls for our players

1104~~~
Should go on holiday and work on his fitness before playing again really. Must be tired after WC, he wasn't this bad last season.

1105~~~
When Falcao produces more he'll play.

1106~~~
Had a decent game but horrendous work-rate this game for me. It was only after the Falcao sub that he seemed to come alive.

1107~~~
If it is a straight choice, I agree Falcao wins. It wasn't a straight choice tonight because of Falcao's jet lag though (if LVG is to be believed anyway). Falcao definitely threw his weight about and made his presence known much more than RVP did.

This is the first time we've played with a lone striker though so it's hard to say how Falcao may have done, as he's not had an opportunity in that role. I do feel like the supply to RVP was poor though which didn't give him much opportunity to impress.

1108~~~
The trouble with RvP is he's in decline. We have to come to grips with the reality that he will never be the same player he was in his final year at Arsenal or even his first season at OT. Food for thought.

1109~~~
Interesting. In less games, Falcao 2 assists and 1 goal. RVP 2 goals. Not even going to go into things like link up play etc.

1110~~~
He actually looked much brighter playing off Falcao. Isolated up front, double teamed by two string forwards, he looked harmless. He also snatched at chances showing his confidence is still low. Probably needs to play with Falcao right now to take pressure off him.

1111~~~
When Falcao plays he'll produce.

1112~~~
what a lazy player he has become. Even my dutch roommate said his play today was pathetic.

1113~~~
Falcao really made the West Brom defenders work more than v Persie did all game long... I am a fan of his, but it is time to drop him for a while. He has been awful for Holland as well and the media and people here are destroying him for his attitude and performances.

1114~~~
Absolutely. Strangely enough, his all round game seems to be on an another level to RVP. Not that Falcao is actually great at it, but RVP has dramatically declined.

1115~~~
Criticism is a bit much. But he was poor tonight though and hasn't been in great form. I'd love to see a run of games where we have both Falcao and Di Maria on the pitch for 90 minutes. We seem destined to never see that though. 

Would also have liked to see Falcao and van Persie up top together from the start. van Persie improved once he came on.

1116~~~
This. I am surprised some people can't see it. I have no agenda against RVP. Nor do I expect miracles. And I still believe he is a great striker (unlike some perhaps). But right now he doesn't look quite right and Falcao looks very solid on the ball. Falcao is very Tevez like in the way he fights for the ball and holds players off.

1117~~~
He really has lost all of his mobility and pace. Its horrible to see.

1118~~~
You're pretending like Falcao has set the world on fire. He hasn't. Neither have been good enough.

1119~~~
Way to static once again. There were so many times today we were in good positions and he was nowhere to be found. RvP two years ago would have just shown up and scored, the RvP of today, did not.

I hope it's just a form/fitness issue, but i am getting worried it might be downhill for him from here on

1120~~~
Am I pretending that? Not sure how you've inferred that from my posts.

1121~~~
Seems that way.

1122~~~
He looks in sharp decline. I don't see any signs of life in him.

1123~~~
Has a serious case of Torres syndrome at the moment.

1124~~~
Tbf he put in a good shift but his fitness looks to be gone. Falcao came on and look twice as mobile as him.

1125~~~
Let's put it this way. Falcao hasn't looked very sharp with his finishing in his little over 3 games or whatever it is. However, for me, his link up play and overall game has been quite a bit better than RVP's. RVP is not finishing in a way that justifies him being kept in the team at the moment over Falcao. Nor are we a team that requires individual brilliance from him like 2012/2013. This team has goals in it, and I think we would be better off with Falcao over RVP if we go for one striker. Strange that they finally seemed to link-up well at the end of this game.

1126~~~
People apperently forgot Di Maria was the one who kicked the ball over the sideline for no reason at all, leading to WBA's first goal? Angel didn't have a good game tonight, definitely not a better game than RVP. Mata and Adnan weren't better than Robin was today, those were our four attacking players. Comparing his performance to non-attacking players is a bit more difficult. But I'd say:

Herrera was worse than Van Persie today. Our four defenders made silly mistakes costing us the win, Shaw was particularly bad. David de Gea didn't save much. Leaving only Blind to perform much better than RVP tonight, making RVP the second best player in our starting 11 in my opinion.

RVP gets the stick for his decision making? Yet Shaw was playing on Buttner level tonight, didn't stop him from trying to do a Roberto Carlos pass in the 60 minute or so, losing the ball again. Mata lost some silly balls, Adnan and Angel too, leading to a goal for WBA. People also conveniently forget RVP hitting the inside of post, he was literally an inch away from a goal. But yeah obviously he is past it. So whatever.
.

Numbers are not everything, but..

I think about 10-days old data.

1128~~~
Di Maria had a few wayward passes for sure but that's a ludicrous statement.

1129~~~
Keep playing him up top with Falcao. I am convinced he just needs a partner to make runs off him and make space for him.

1130~~~
At this stage all that he offers is the possibility that he'll score a difficult chance, due to his technique.

That's outweighed by the fact that he slows things down, wants it into feet, doesn't always challenge for the ball, doesn't link-up well with another striker, can't go in behind, doesn't suit a counter...

My opinion - we have never looked that truly fluid since van Persie arrived (unless he's not been playing) but that was alright when he was consistently scoring to make up for it.
Nowadays he doesn't even do that. And he's even worse for the overall play.

1131~~~
I think that's like the 4th time this season that  Di Maria has played him in on a one and one and he has hit it straight at the keeper.

I keep saying though, he has great movement upfront, LVG must value that quite a lot.

1132~~~
I thought he was alright...probably better than in most of his recent performances. The issue is that we compare him to his old high standard and he isn't near that at the moment. Has definitely declined I think. Some decisions about his role have to be made.

1133~~~
Doesn't look out of form, he just looks shot.

1134~~~
To be fair, his movement is still good, but if you do nothing with it, whats the point? He used to smash them in the top corner, nowadays it all are mishit volleys.

1135~~~
I know he was getting a hammering in the match day thread but I actually thought he played OK. Made some decent runs, especially in the first half. I know he's not at the required level yet but today, for me, he was better.

1136~~~
What exactly do we play RvP for? His finishing? This was the 4th or 5th time that ADM put him clean through and he completely fluffed his lines. Do we play him for his hard work? No, he's quite the passenger. The one time he did work hard and win the ball from Lescott, he had Mata clear in the box with a simple chance to score and he decided to be selfish, take his time with the ball and just waste it. Do we play him for his build up play and ability to bring others into play? Clearly not because he's slow, lethargic and doesn't spot some very obvious runs. Falcao is also much much better than him in the buildup play. We blamed it on his fitness early season but he's played 90 mins on multiple occasions for club and country now and he shows absolutely no sign of improvement. LVG loves the guy so it won't happen but when Rooney returns, we really need to go to Rooney-Falcao.

1137~~~
Refuse to believe he is "past it" but definitely out of form... 

Falcao on the other hand seems to be hitting a peak

1138~~~
Well even so, I don't see how Di Maria had a better game than RVP tonight. The stats are very interesting, because time and again I hear the managers and ex players on tv say that the forwards are the players who are most dependant on the rest of the team. Looking at those statistics you could just as easily say it's because he's been playing in an inferior team since the start of 2013/2014, which is true.

Doesn't mean I think he's in truly devastating form or anything, but if you want to talk stats, I could just as easily say that in the 2013/2014 season for Holland, he scored 6 goals in 4 World Cup Qualifiers and 4 goals in 6 World Cup matches. Scoring 10 in 10 makes great stats. And if you look at this season, last game for us I thought he had a quiet game. Game before that against West Ham he was excellent. Tonight he was the best of our attacking players. Combine all that and I simpy don't see how he is the problem. Same goes Rooney, Falcao, Di Maria or even Mata and Adnan for that matter, the attacking players are not really the problem.

1139~~~
His hold up play was dire today, no presence up front.

1140~~~
I don't blame him for the result, but feel the result might have been different had Falcao started in his place. He must have some record for hitting the woodwork.

1141~~~
He's definitely playing with some sort of injury. He's not nearly as mobile as he should be

1142~~~
Di Maria put in about 7 or 8 extremely dangerous crosses which RVP got nowhere near. He also played RVP in once if I remember correctly. He also helped create the Fellaini goal. Not his usual standard but much better than RVP.

1143~~~
It must be, because he stifles the team's play. 
It's alright to stifle the teams play if you deliver and score important goals. But if you don't, it's time to try someone else.

1144~~~
We have a clinical Rooney and probably the best finisher in the world in Falcao for that! That surely can't be the reason for him to start.

1145~~~
It can only be that Van Gaal believes that the Van Persie of a couple of years ago can come again but I completely agree that he looks completely off the pace at the moment. It's a shame to see because his first 6 months here, he played some of the best football I've ever seen a United player play but it's been a long time where he's not looked sharp. In a strange way I hope he is carrying an injury because at least then there's a chance that he can get back to something close to his best, the alternative is that he's finished. The other issue is Mata, if he was playing well then there'd be more of an incentive to play him behind Rooney and Falcao but he's in poor form as well.

1146~~~
If he starts the next match then I'd seriously start questioning Van Gaal's judgement! The number of inviting crosses that Di Maria put in that he never made an attempt to attack is infuriating. It's time to play Falcao on his own until Rooney returns or else he will drag us down with him. It's not like him and Mata have posted numbers that justify their inclusion at the risk of the team's solidity either. 
LVG needs to start putting out a team that is solid, which defends from the front and can play a bit more cohesively not to continue shoehorning big names that haven't earnt their keep. If he doesn't then the next couple of weeks will be ugly, really ugly.

1147~~~
Whichever way you want to paint it that was a lousy performance. Reckon you could count the number of 50/50 balls he won today on one hand and his workrate was exceptionally poor; throughout the first half you saw Herrera sprinting past him to close a defender down. If I had a choice between playing him up front in the next game or playing Fellaini there I'd probably go for Fellaini at this point. Hopefully Falcao will get the nod in the next game.

I like RVP and I think he's got a role here, but at the moment it very much looks like that role should be as a substitute.

1148~~~
needs to be benched let along made captain.  If LVG continues to choose him then I will have to critique his management.  Simple as that.

1149~~~
I have no other possible reasons...

1150~~~
If anything I would say that RVP would benefit from a reduction in gametime at this point. Time to start managing his appearances a little better - which is easy when we have the likes of Rooney and Falcao available.

I dont think RVP can play as a lone striker any more either. Granted his appearances in the 4-4-2 this season havent been fantastic either, but his movement and work rate is so low at this stage (note that his movement in and around the box is still threatening, there just isnt enough movement in general from him) that he poses far less of a threat to opposition CBs. Not sure what the answer is with this one, he is still a valuable squad member but certainly isnt looking like he should be first choice at the moment.

1151~~~
His hold-up play is nonexistent these days.

1152~~~
It'll be interesting to see what happens with his contract - I think next season is the last on his current contract, he's one of the higher earners, and we (used to) have a policy about not offering more than one-year deals to over 30s. 

If the club have noticed some of the issues the supporters are worried about, then there might be a decision to be made sooner rather than later.

1153~~~
It may be time to suggest he moves on to Italy.
He came and did what Sir Alex bought him for, but I think he created as many problems as he solved (problems that didn't really need solving)
I can't see any system that van Persie suits better than Falcao or Rooney, and he wont like being a super sub.

Wont happen with van Gaal though...

1154~~~
Not to hark on a point, but for quite a few years now we have been making some very bad decisions on players who we bring in and those who we don't play and let go.  Think Pogba.  But in this RVP thread, selling Welbz and making RVP captain is looking a very bad choice.

1155~~~
Thought it last season, but he is just in a decline now. He's 31 so its to be expected, but he was shite during the world cup apart from the Spain game, and has been shite most of the time this season as well. Can be useful once he realizes that he's not what he used to be and just becomes a squad player and a bench option, but a starter he most definitely should not be anymore. Falcao is on a completely different level to him, as is Rooney.

I said it before though, we would have been far better off squad wise if Fergie never signed him. He was brilliant for that one season where he won us the title, but it unsettled Rooney, ended Kagawa's hopes of playing as a 10 pretty much, and made sure that Welbeck would only get games on the wing if he did play so he wasn't able to develop here properly. Not that I think Welbeck had enough to become a key player here, its just things could have gone differently and probably for the better in terms of the overall team without signing RvP.

1156~~~
Rooney is the captain.

1157~~~
Yes, I understand that Rooney is the captain.  But with Roo suspended, LVG made RVP captain on the back of a number of useless performances for us.

1158~~~
Who would you suggest? There is a distinct lack of suitable candidates.

1159~~~
Because Fletcher is out of his depth, Carrick and Evans are injured. So Van Persie is the next senior player.

1160~~~
I guess we just found out part of our problem.  Fact remains, RVP has been completely ineffectual, the team is struggling for any form, and he is the best choice for captain.  Suppose Carrick would be better choice if he was fit, but he wasn't.  Evans?  No.

1161~~~
I was using the excuse of form but he has played quite a few games now almost 10 counting cub and country and the performances are similar, he is slower, he has lost his hold up ability. Everything is so difficult for him. The movement is still there but this is his decline, he won't go back to what he. RVP is a 31 year old striker who has tons of injuries over his career. At this point he is hurting them team with is play. Falcao should start upfront alone in the next game so we can have anther midfielder in and more balance.

1162~~~
Interesting point Gary Neville made about set pieces and our team lacking height having Rafael marking players today.

Possible reason that RVP might be playing more than deserved given his height and aerial presence defensively ?

1163~~~
I've thought that for a while. He is an important player for us defending corners and wide freekicks. If he were to be left out then LVG would have to think very hard about other selections, perhaps include Smalling and/or Fellaini, or be taking a huge risk whenever opponents have the chance to push their tall defenders forward at set pieces. The other approach would be to tell De Gea to come for everything and accept that from time to time he's going to miss, as he did against West Ham, resulting in us conceding a soft goal.

1164~~~
Wasn't a great performance by him tonight. However, the service too him was also pretty poor for large parts and he didn't get too many chances. Unlucky with that shot that hit the woodwork, should have squared that pass to Mata but also made the chance from nothing, looked livelier when Falcao came on. Maybe when Rooney comes back, him being benched for Falcao will spur him to regain form, I'm not ready to write him off yet at all.

1165~~~
No strength, no pace, limited mobility and a real lack of commitment in his play, there were several excellent balls put into the box and he was nowhere to be seen.

1166~~~
Di Maria was spoon feeding chances by the bucket load.

1167~~~
To be honest he was feeding on scraps today. His performance wasn't that bad, still has great movement. He was inches away from scoring a brilliant goal. However, I do think that van Persie shouldn't start over Falcao. Rvp seems to lack energy in the second half.

1168~~~
Di Maria played much better than most of our team and there was a couple of moments when van Persie should have done better, but Januzaj didn't offer much and the crossing from Shaw and Rafael was inconsistent.

1169~~~
Can we say "to hell with seniority" please? In the current situation, I would give the armband to a player who has shown he deserves it most.

1170~~~
Feeding on scraps? The balls Di Maria was playing in the box the Van Persie of a couple of years ago would shave and a couple of goals. He clearly just isn't the same player. If he is on the pitch due to defending set pieces that is a sad state of affairs.

1171~~~
Was RvP actually our captain tonight as well by the way?

1172~~~
Well to show that you deserve the armband you need time, and all our main players are new.

1173~~~
Im convinced Van Gaal is giving him as long a run of games as humanly possibly to see if he can regain any of the form that helped us to our title in his first season. From more of a long term point of view. If van persie is unable to hit the ground running after january i think he will switch to falcao fulltime and RVP will be off in the summer with falcao as his direct replacement.

1174~~~
Another example of how we shouldn't be blinded over big names and the thing so-called "experience".RVP hasn't been the same player this season and should be dropped.And yet people questioned why I thought Welbeck would be a better option for us this season, as poor in front of goal as he might be.

1175~~~
The point will be arrived at soon where LvG just has to say 'enough is enough' and drop him.

1176~~~
Dear God, no! <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Why would RVP deserve anything to get the leeway until January? We need to win matches now and it is not by sending players who are out of form that we will win matches. I'm of those who believe LVG should corner RVP by sending him to the bench in favour of Falcao, then Rooney and then Wilson if necessary; if RVP is cornered and yet has any pride left, he should be able to come back with the mindset of a wounded animal. It's RVP the wounded animal that we need, not this RVP.

1177~~~
Most underwhelming player of this season for me. Gutting how much he has declined.

1178~~~
He needs to be benched imo. Currently, we look like we play with 10 men as he is not involved, not getting at the end of our balls and doesnt contribute much to our build up play either. For some reason, he is undroppable. Let's see if LVG benches him

1179~~~
My problem with him is that he doesn't involve himself enough in the build-up play, which is a shame as that has normally been one of his best attributes; his passing, vision and technique are world class (or at least used to be). When he does involve himself, he has a tendency to fall back far too much without busting his guts to get back into the box - see Rafael's cross after being released by Januzaj (that one time). 

I'm far from giving up on him, but he is struggling.

1180~~~
Why wasnt he standing over that freekick, I understand that Mata has scored one this season. But RVP at Arsenal as captain took them all and especially when on his left and tried to when he first came here. Last night you'd think he would have grabbed that ball from mata 25 yards from goal. 

Seems like he's lost a bit of confidence or urgency or something. Not playing like the player we signed at the moment, has been poor for Holland too according to my dutch mates.

1181~~~
I thought that was probably van Persie's best performance of the season and better than anything we've seen so far from Falcao.

I'm pretty sure Mata's scored more free kicks than van Persie in the PL in 1/3 of the games.

1182~~~
If that is correct, I would assume the same would be said for him over Rooney then, but when Wayne plays and there is a freekick on the right he nearly always has it. I'm just commenting that Im surprised RVP who has previously fancied himself freekicks wasn't anywhere near it. As captain I would have thought he would have pulled rank with it being perfectly positioned for his left foot (and Mata's as you correctly point out).

1183~~~
From what I remember van Persie's only ever scored one free kick for us and that was largely thanks to Clichy being a pussy, and I'm fairly certain he scored more free kicks in the (injury-hit) first half of his career than he has in his second. With Rooney it's the complete opposite, he's scored at least a couple of free kicks a season for the last 3 seasons. Mata's definitely our best free kick taker and van Persie's just doing the sensible thing in letting the expert take it, IMO.

1184~~~
Strange how RVP has turned from our Henry to our Ozil... I don't know whats up with him. I expected him to bang in the goals after a great World Cup but he seems completely disinterested. LVG should plant one of our players to start a fight with him. That might fire him up a little...

1185~~~
It was the French lesbian I believe.

I remember him getting quite a few bullets from free kicks for Arsenal but he wasn't consistent with them at all.

1186~~~
I thought Blackett claimed that AdM was the best free kick taker in training.

1187~~~
Except the volley strike yesterday, he seems to hardly strike the ball properly these days, always seem to mis-hit it, yesterday he had a great curled in ball from ADM from the left wing, which RVP of old would have smashed it, but he mis-hit it, and in the first half there was the Lescott mistake he should have squared it to Mata, who was in acres of space in the six yard box. Had we taken those chances we would have been 2-1 up in first half itself. Then there was another similar pass to yesterday against Leicester City which he hit straight at the keeper, i used to be so confident at Rvp scoring chances, but now he doesn't seem to be the same player, i felt if it was Falcao in the first half, he would have got on the end of those crosses, i felt Janujaz was the same, there were three crosses in the first half half towards Janujaz which he didn't make a proper run to get infront of his marker and ended up fouling their defender each time. i feel he has to be benched for Falcao.

1188~~~
I was shocked he didn't bury that chance from Di Maria's cross, was exactly the kind of stuff he's been putting away for fun for years.

1189~~~
Thats something that been bugging me too. Its like he can't even produce the same amount of power and venom in his shots anymore. He's been played through about 5 times by Di Maria this season, each time on his left foot, and all his shots have been relatively weak. RVP of old would absolutely lash his shots most of the time. I really can't understand it at all.

1190~~~
Yep. There were about 5-6 crosses where we were crying out for....you know....a striker like Falcao who could attack the 6 yard box....if only we had a striker like Falcao...

1191~~~
The 1 that absolutely pissed me off was when Januzaj fed Rafael to the byline. Rafael put the ball in a perfect area for a tap in, but nobody was in the box!.

I looked at the replay and RVP has come short to Januzaj looking for the pass.

That's all well and good, but if you don't get the pass you need to get into a goal scoring area. 

Van Nistelrooy or Hernandez would have scored that no problem. Was frustrating having Falcao on the bench for so long.

1192~~~
Scored 1 in his hattrick in the CL aswell, but it was a weak FK that should have been saved.

1193~~~
I don't think its fair to say he's disinterested, He's just in decline and its probably hard for him to see such a sharp decline in the numbers he's putting up.

1194~~~
Form is temporary, class is permanent.

1195~~~
RVP doesn't attack the ball at all. His movement is good at times when he decides to look for some space (looks like he's in energy saving mode most of the time), but his strength and pace has declined a lot. 

If the plan is to hit crosses into the box, Falcao should definitely be starting ahead of him.

1196~~~
I've said it since last year, still think he should be used sparingly as to elongate his career here. There's no doubting his class and ability, it's just he isn't what he used to be. Give him a chance in the box and he'll bury it.

1197~~~
I'd say that's a simplistic 'soundbite', with all due respect KiD MoYeS: first of all, he'd need to get to the chances to bury them, loads of really good balls into the box on Monday that he was nowhere near; and second of all, he isn't half as clinical as that sentence makes him out to be. He misses quite a few chances in the box.

1198~~~
His performance on Monday was strange. He spent a lot of time just outside the box, I dunno if he was following orders or what. He is still a lethal striker though at times, we know this, he very nearly scored a peach of a goal out of nowhere even though he'd been anonymous.

1199~~~
This isn't even the case anymore. Di Maria has in every game he and van Persie have played, put Robin in for at least one very very good goalscoring chance, but he simply isn't as ruthless in his finishing anymore.

1200~~~
he's always been prone to missing easy chances, it's the fact that he's completely lost his ability to pull great goals out of absolutely nothing (a prominent feature of his first season here) that's been the problem. The magic is no longer there, a bit like Mrs. RiP's sex life.

1201~~~
The post denied him a beautiful goal against West Brom. He still has that capability, it just may be less consistent.

1202~~~
And decline is reality, it just happens to some sooner than others, not every player will be like Giggs and Zanetti.

1203~~~
Many people miss call a decline though, its a bit soon to be saying he is in decline me thinks

1204~~~
Both those guys had a dip in form in their early 30s. Giggs was getting booed in 2005.

I'm not saying RVP is the same, because he's showing no signs of improving...but it's too early to say he's done and that's it.

1205~~~
his injury history is what makes e feel he is done, one too many the wrong side of 29 I feel have permanently taken something from his game.

1206~~~
I'm just saying there are no guarantees that his previous top level will return. Personally his current play reminds me of Shevechenko when he legs went.

1207~~~
I'm kinda thinking along the same lines. Those injuries last season were just one too many injuries for his body to take. Its the only thing I can think of that would explain his physical decline. He looks like a 40 year old right now, and not in a Sheringham sort of way.

1208~~~
His game has never been about pace, so I'm not too worried about that. Everyone is over reacting about his performances, he was feeding on scraps vs WBA. I'm not sure what people are expecting from him, I know Di Maria put a couple of decent balls in the box but when you are playing one striker up front you cant expect him to get on every single cross. 

He's just in a bad patch of form, I'm sure he will start banging the goals in again. As a team we have to create more chances though.

1209~~~
Ffs.

1210~~~
While I don't think he'll get back to his very best again, I agree that he's still capable of doing quite well for us since his games more based off of finishing and ability than pace. The fact he's gotten a couple of games despite being well below par is a positive, and I actually thought he was okay at times on Monday.

1211~~~
He has obviously declined since he came here two years ago, but I do think he still has something to offer. We do need to play him with another striker to get the best out of him though at his current form.

1212~~~
He's not in top form, but I also think that he's not helped by his team mates too.

Last year, when the season began, he was in top form and scored goals because the team used to play with pace and penetration. As the year gone, he started to slow a bit, like the team, and I think that he's far better with a lot of movements around him, and closer to the goal.

He was excellent his last year at Arsenal because of that, he played higher in the pitch, ran less, and had all the ball around the penalty box and beneficiated from Arsenal pass game too

With Moyesy he was a target for crosses only, we played too deep and too slowly. I think this style suits more to a Falcao, Rooney or even somebody like Cavani who loves to start deep. 

I really think that if we manage to control the ball better, and then being higher on the pitch with more penetration than we have now, he will benefit from been upfront. 

I would say that with players like Vidal, Khedira, Strootman and top wingers like Angel, he could shine again.

1213~~~
I feel its not just form, he has just declined physically, i remember how good he was in his first season for us, he was so good at holding the ball, and bringing others into play, although he was never pacy, but he had this Iniesta like ability to go past players without pace, and make a yard of space and take shots, but now he seems lazy in his movement, his touch seems heavy and the biggest difference is, he used to create chances out of nothing for himself and others aswell.

 He used to be one of our creative players, now he is very dependent on others and seems to have lost that spark or the edge which made him deadly, If VP had the ball in the box, i used to be excited and felt like something could happen, just as i feel now with Di Maria, now he just passes it to somebody or mis- hits the shots or losses it.

1214~~~
Agreed. His performance was not that bad, you have to factor in that Januzaj and Mata were awful and really didn't provide much. Di Maria was good in patches but gave the ball away too much. I think some fans have unrealistic expectations from RVP. Even when he was in his best form for us he used to miss the 'easier' chances. I believe that LVG knows what he is doing with RVP and I'm sure it will turn out fine.

1215~~~
Just went and had a look at his highlights from the Madrid game, plus a few videos from his Arsenal days, just to see if the decline is being exaggerated. Sadly, its like watching a different player. In comparison, it looks like he's running in treacle these days, with a bag of potatoes on his back.

If it is a physical thing, I wonder if he'd be able to adapt his game? He looked a lot better when he came deep against West Brom for example, and wasn't having to hold the ball up or make runs. I reckon he's probably got the technique to be a good #10.

1216~~~
The hyperbole on here about this guy is insane! He just isn't playing well at the moment. I don't think anything has changed about his physique or how he plays the game. The problem looks to be his attitude.

1217~~~
If he's not scoring those chances, it's difficult to see exactly what he brings to the team.
He stifled our play before, but at least then he was scoring goals that others couldn't. Now he's stifling the play even more, and not scoring those chances that other couldn't.

1218~~~
Watch this video, and compare the difference in his sharpness and physical strength when holding the ball up, compared to now. He barely gets knocked off the ball at all, and is winning physical battles with players like Ramos.

1219~~~
If his shot goes in off the post instead of back out then none of the crap in this thread gets posted.

Fickle little internet fans.

1220~~~
Like I said, much of it is his attitude and desire.

1221~~~
It's not just about whether he scores a goal any more.

1222~~~
Posts like this are ridiculous. 

Hmmm, that would be a strange one. Surely his motivation under LVG would be as good as ever?

1223~~~
You never know. He just doesn't look hungry for winning and trophies at the moment. I didn't think he looked arsed at the world cup either.

1224~~~
It quite clearly is a physical, fitness issue. His sharpness and awareness and has gone as he has lost pace - whether or not his game relied on him passing players in sprints or not is irrelevant, he lacks the inital burst to match his great movement. This is also exemplefied with his now lack of stamina which he reserves- Berbatov-like, so he isn't getting on the end of as many chances as he should be. He was never a clinical goalscorer, he was just an excellent one at taking half chances. And that's looking less and less likely as he will get into less and less opportunities.

1225~~~
Sure it wasn't, but right now it seems like he finds it difficult (physically) as a lone striker- so that's a little bit worrying. 

Mind you it would be silly to expect from him the same effort like 2 years ago. His role should be limited though.

1226~~~
People keep saying it's form, he hasn't played well for a while. When is the last time he was playing consistently good football ? For me it's over 8 months ago, that's more than form. That is a decline.

1227~~~
Longer than that...

1228~~~
I do think we should be starting Falcao over Van Persie, but I'm finding some of the criticism to be over the top. We've had lesser players over the years who've people have covered up for them with the "he didn't have a proper preseason", but the same isn't given for Van Persie, nor is anyone mentioning he's only had 6 games to get used to playing with Di Maria, Falcao and Herrera. He's still a good player and has a lot left to offer us.

1229~~~
At 1:08 was just amazing. Van Persie really needs to step up a few notches, the difference in his game is brutal.

1230~~~
That's nothing man.

Look at 0:40, he's just, just touching Ramos face and it seems that he's broken his jaw in half.

1231~~~
More like 15 months mate 

Tbh he's been utter shite since fergie left

1232~~~
His football wasn't great last season compared to what he's capable of, but I think it's a bit harsh to say he was shite. His goals return was still fairly respectable. Injuries probably held him back a bit, although that's obviously another major problem which could potentially result in his decline coming now, as a lot feel it is.

1233~~~
Yeah, it's been a long while.

My biggest qualm by far with Van Gaal is the ludicrous favouritism he's shown RvP thus far. Starting him or starting Falcao against Chelsea and City could easily make the difference between getting something out of the game and getting nothing.

It's almost like playing with 10 men when RvP's on the pitch at the moment, and it makes it way easier for teams to get at us.

He contributes nothing, and most worryingly - he causes the opposing CBs ZERO BOTHER. This is the sticking point that we need to admit to ourselves. As hard as it is to believe given the player he used to be, any CB partnership in the PL must now be viewing RvP as an easy afternoon's work as he just doesn't cause problems - he doesn't make a nuisance of himself, he's slow, he can't bully defenders anymore and his decision making is becoming poor.

I think many people are stuck thinking of him of how he was two seasons ago. But two seasons is a long time for a player that's spent the majority of their career injury prone. Defenders get younger and stronger and faster and RvP has gotten older and weaker and slower. That's a decline.

And he's being pampered (with minutes) at the expense of the team.

1234~~~
I have no idea why people are talking about Falcao starting instead of RvP on Sunday - both will start

1235~~~
I wouldn't bother mate, the amateur psychologists in here have already diagnosed his mental state as a problem from watching him play football.

Reactionary nonsense to a game he played in front of Herrera (honeymoon period), Mata (popular), Januzaj (young) who had some of the worst individual performances I've seen any of our players have over the last few years.

We adopted Tony Pulis' Stoke tactics in the 2nd half when Fellaini came on which didn't suit RVP at all, no surprise he nearly scored straight away after the introduction of Falcao.

1236~~~
Oh please...

1237~~~
He managed to hit the post with a sublime volley outside the box and could have been the savior for this match.

He was also pretty good as a sole man against West Ham, 

Last year he was excellent against Olympiacos when he needed to be the star man

But when we see the images of 2 years ago, it's amazing how he's changed badly

1238~~~
Im in two minds about this one. I kind of agree with Rood, I can see both starting. But on the other hand it seems to me that playing two strikers against Chelsea is suicidal.

Id personally start Falcao and leave RVP on the bench but (as usual) people are going way overboard with their criticisms of RVP. I dont think he's past it and he's already shown a few flashes of brilliance. Its not unusual for people who went the distance in the WC to have a slow start to the season, his form will come eventually.

1239~~~
That's also the game I think of when comparing RVP to his old self. His first touch, hold-up, dribbling and interplay used to be mesmerising. Last season he was hit/miss on form, but since the injury at the end of the Olympiakos game he's been so consistently off form that I'm starting to think it's now his current level.

It's also mental to see how dangerous we looked against Real Madrid only 18 months ago, with that very same squad that Moyes inherited, that SAF would've struggled with...different topic I know.

1240~~~
Well I want to see us go with 2 striker and have a go at Chelsea - our defence is weak so I think the only way we can get anything from this game is to go for the kill. 

Also RvP and Falcao have linked up very well - they seem to have formed an instant understanding

1241~~~
You mentioned that before. Not quite sure "very well" is how Id put it but theyve had their moments for sure. I feel both would play better alone up front but it looks like Van Gaal agrees with you anyway so we'll see how it develops. 

Personally I fear your idea sounds good but will see us get torn apart. It seems tactically naive to me, I can imagine Mourinho would like nothing more than for us to throw the kitchen sink at them but Ive never claimed to be any kind of tactician myself and I trust Van Gaal's abilities in that respect. So, again, we'll see.

1242~~~
Well I more meant very well for players who have only just played a couple of times together.

2 strikers is a bit of gamble and quite possible that it could backfire completely - we are at home so it would be my personal choice (away to City is a different scenario) but lets see how LvG plays it. He is a big game manager and Im sure he has a specific plan in place already.

1243~~~
Sorry Rood, I just haven't seen this. A few bits of movement has looked good, but I would say that comes as standard as one is just doing the opposite of the other (front/back post). Hope I am proved wrong on Sunday though.

1244~~~
No doubt.

1245~~~
Falcao has already set up 2 goals for RvP (and that is coming from a player who very rarely got any assists at all while at Athletico) - if that's not an instant partnership then I dont know what is. Just compare Rooney and RvP who have barely managed to complete a pass to each other in the space of 2 years!

1246~~~
Theyre both great players and yes they have linked up already. But is it a partnership that is equal to, let alone more than the sum of its parts? Will it get the best out of Falcao? He hasnt looked that sharp for us, and yet when he played for Colombia I get the impression he did - though I didnt actually see the game. I just think if you have one of the world's best finishers at the club its a shame if he ends up in a partnership where his main role becomes provider for RVP. Maybe there are people who would be better doing that. And maybe Falcao would be doing better if he had someone worrying about providing for him. But its very early to be drawing too many conclusions about this anyway. This is precisely why we all knew it would "take time for everyone to gel" - and why having so many changes in the team all at once would always prove disruptive, there is going to be a certain amount of trial and error while we establish what works and what doesnt.

1247~~~
Basically <a class="username" data-user="23783, @Adebesi" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/23783/">@Adebesi</a> put what I would try and say in much better terms. I feel like the partnership is probably hindering each of them from the way they would be most effective.

1248~~~
Not to mention that playing the two of them together means one less player in other areas of the pitch, where we're likely to be significantly out-gunned as it is.

1249~~~
I don't really see any partnership developing either. It's inevitable that they'll set each other up occasionally. But they both do better individually. If Falcao <i>must </i>have a partner, then Rooney's more equipped.

1250~~~
While that may be true, I don't think it's fair to use Rooney's suspension as a stick to beat RVP for the performance against West Brom.

At least he was available to do his job.

1251~~~
Honestly, Im repeating myself here but I cant shake the image of Mourinho rubbing his hands together with glee at the thought of us attacking them with gay abandon. It brings to mind the very last scene from Blackadder IV where they are all about to go over the top, the dramatic irony of knowing how that was going to end. 

You can say our defence is shite so lets just attack the hell out of them and not worry about defence. Or you can say our defence is shite so we need to do everything we can to give them a chance and trust our excellent attacking players to nick something for us. I know the latter isnt The United Way TM but while we look as hapless as we have been of late to be honest Id rather compromise on that score than watch us get humiliated. 

Once we are up and running and more comfortable executing what Van Gaal is asking of them Ill be much more comfortable about taking the game to a team like Chelsea. Right now I think we have to be a bit more... well, tactical.

1252~~~
I'm not? It's not based on the West Brom game at all.

I'm saying that Rooney's more equipped to play in a partnership than van Persie. Especially if the partner has good movement, and releases the ball quickly - like Falcao.
Ideally we don't play two up top, but if we must, then I think Rooney and Falcao would be our best bet.

I haven't seen much by the way of a partnership to suggest van Persie and Falcao wouldn't be better off without each other.

1253~~~
What way would people like us to set up if not two up front? I think the diamond is the best fit right now for the players we have.

1254~~~
Bit of a catch 22 actually. Ideally, I'd like us to go with one up top and three in central midfield. However, it's abundantly clear that RvP is no longer mobile enough to play as a lone striker and Falcao has looked only marginally more mobile in his games for United thus far.

1255~~~
Are you pining for Welbeck, Pogue?

1256~~~
Taking into account that Falcao is a striker who thrives in a crossing team he should really be starting ahead of RVP for us. Di Maria is regularly putting crosses into fantastic areas and he's barely moved.

1257~~~
It's difficult. We still don't have the required players for either the diamond or 4-3-3.

I feel a diamond with Rooney and Falcao up top could be okay. But then you'd have Mata in the '10' - which isn't ideal.
A 4-3-3 with Falcao up top, Di Maria wide left, Rooney wide right perhaps? Herrera, Carrick and Blind in midfield? Still not great.

At the moment I don't see anything looking quite right.

I'd go with the 4-3-3 personally. Give Falcao a go up top on his own. It seems that Herrera could probably do with the extra midfielder behind him too. I wouldn't mind that approach (but Valencia wide right) against Chelsea. It may be too soon to start Falcao up top on his own in this sort of game though, which is annoying.

1258~~~
This. Crazy to play them both, and pointless.

1259~~~
I would like us to switch to that eventually but I don't think we have the wingers to do it now. Januzaj hasn't impressed when given game time and Mata is out of form too and would leave Rafael very exposed if he was to play there. That only leaves Valencia and I'm not even sure if he's fit, is he? Even if he is, while he would help out with Hazard, he offers nothing going forward so isn't ideal either. Rooney playing there for a one off game might not be too bad but he didn't exactly convince there against Madrid two seasons ago, IIRC.

1260~~~
Id go 4-2-3-1 like we did (on paper) against WBA, it didnt look very good on the day but for me it still looks like the best deployment of our resources. Id like to see Blind and Carrick as the 2, Di Maria, Herrera and Mata as the three and then Falcao up front. Or maybe Fellaini as the wildcard in the middle of the 3 with Di Maria and Herrera either side of him. Im not sure about that but given how Mata and Januzaj looked last game its food for thought.

1261~~~
<img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1262~~~
That could work. Mata would really really need to put a shift in though.
He would need to in that role anyway , but it goes without saying that Chelsea fight for the ball better than anyone.

It's him or Valencia. By playing Mata you're effective trading that high level of work rate for the chance he might pull out something special

1263~~~
The kid gloves with Falcao is kind of confusing me. Hadn't he played a bunch of games in France before we signed him?

Surely we should be considering him as fully fit by now? I know where you're coming from as I keep thinking of him as being about to break down any moment. No idea why. Probably because of all my anxiety about the injury when we signed him. At the end of the day, though, he's been passed fully fit to play competitive football and has already played a decent number of games for club and country. He cost us a frigging fortune and has a reputation of being one the very best strikers on the planet. He has to start every game, surely?

1264~~~
Yeah, enough of the pussyfooting around with Falcao now. Time for him to man up. And get a bloody haircut while he's at it, the fanny.

1265~~~
Yeah, I'd also like to see Carrick sat next to Blind as an extra man and just 1 up top (Falcao). I'd also be welcome to seeing a well drilled Valencia to defend the right channel and cover for Rafael in big games...

-----------------------DDG-------------------
Rafael--------Jones--------Rojo--------Shaw
--------Carrick-----------------Blind----------
Valencia------------Herrera-------------ADM
----------------------Falcao-------------------

1266~~~
Yes, Valencia on the right would work for me too for this one.

1267~~~
Yeah, I don't really know why I think this to be honest. Probably time to just get him up there, and give him full games.
Would love to see him given games as the lone striker once Rooney's back.

1268~~~
Would love that. Would like to see it with Rooney in Valencia's role for a bit, perhaps after these two games have been played.
What that definitely shows is that the first team still needs work.

1269~~~
Exactly the team/formation I'd go with.

1270~~~
I cant believe that people think that Carrick, who hasnt played a single minute of this season or even preseason, is ready to start in a huge game on Sunday - we had this discussion on the podcast this week as <a class="username" data-user="55669, @Duafc" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/55669/">@Duafc</a> was suggesting the same. Anyway that's probably more for the Carrick thread

I personally would go with RvP and Falcao - but I seem to be in a minority

1271~~~
He has started the last 3 games before WBA - clearly he was left out on Monday due to international duty so I dont think there are any kid gloves being used here.

1272~~~
I cant believe how people are writing off RVP. He constantly moves around the box we just need to find him more. Against Everton he was double-marked but got more freedom when Falcao came on.
One thing I really like about LVG is that he is a man of his word. He said he was giving everyone a chance to prove themselves and that is what he has done and continues to do. He is obviously giving the RVP-Falcao combination a chance to prove itself. If he thinks it cannot work he will change but I think it can, at least we have two strikers now who look to pass to each other.

1273~~~
Depends how it's approached really though. If Carrick has been training for that specific role in these two specific matches (as Fergie used to do with Fletcher and Park in big games), then I believe he's a player who's easily got the experience to step in and pull off that role. Especially sat next to Blind who's a busy player, with Carrick just providing that extra bit of cover against two very strong midfields.

Put it this way - I'd rather that than playing both RvP and Falcao who will end up isolated and ineffectual and actually benefit Chelsea or City.

Having a well trained, intelligent, experienced head like Carrick sat next to Blind will make it harder for Chelsea or City to walk through us, that's enough for me.

1274~~~
Another article on Eurosport about van Persie being finished this week, they really don't like him it seems.

1275~~~
Yeah was harsh but true. During our last title winning season he was amazing every single game. He scored some amazing goals and you could always rely on him to bag a goal. Last season under Moyes and so far this season it's the exact opposite. He's lost pretty much everything that made him special. Yes I think the injuries have finally caught up with him. The Dutch want him dropped from the national team and Even my 73 year old nan who has supported United all her life said he's finished. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1276~~~
The Eurosport website is a joke in fairness, but yeah.. step it up Robin.

1277~~~
The kid gloves were being used in the post I was responding to (and my own head!)

1278~~~
I think the diamond would be too risky against either Chelsea or Citeh, though playing Herrera as the 10 and bringing in Valencia or Fletcher on the right would help there.

If we want to play RVP and Falcao up front it probably has to be a deep-lying 4-4-2 like Atletico play, with Di Maria on one wing, Blind in the deep (Tiago) role, Herrera as the running around (Gabi) CM and someone tucked in on the right, I suppose Valencia.

1279~~~
4-2-3-1.

Drop RVP.

Get Blind and Carrick as the base, Herrera in front of them and Di Maria + another either side.

1280~~~
It seems most of us are in agreement. 
I'd actually feel semi-confident of beating Chelsea with that side. City's a different matter though.

1281~~~
I wouldn't feel confident of beating either of them. I just think the diamond will mean both teams will just waltz through our midfield and batter us whereas we mightly simply get away with a comprehensive defeat if we've got more of a defensive base.

1282~~~
You think we'll lose both?

1283~~~
The main problem I'd have with the team that most of you want is that we would be even more reliant on Di Maria than we already are. Chelsea keep him quiet and we would have no one else that could create something for us. My other problem is that it would mean Valencia starting on the wing and I really hoped I wouldn't have to see that again anytime soon.

1284~~~
Problem with that (as we saw at West Brom) is that Di Maria is absolutely wasted on the wing. If we had a Carrick/Blind base, I'd prefer something like this...

-----------------------DDG-------------------
Rafael--------Jones--------Rojo--------Shaw
--------Carrick------------------Blind----------
--------------------Herrera-------------------

--------------------Di Maria-------------------
-------------RVP---------------Falcao---------

However, I don't see how Carrick will be anywhere near fit enough to start a match, let alone vs Chelsea.

1285~~~
Bit too narrow I'd say. If you want Di Maria through the middle (which is a good shout) I think Young has to come into the picture for the left flank...

And I just really can't stress enough that RvP and Falcao starting together against any top team is mental.

1286~~~
Its closest thing to the formation we've looked most comfortable with this season, and has got the best out of Di Maria. Having either Young/Valencia on the wing as one of our attacking outlets would be like playing with 10 men, neither are going to hurt Chelsea in the slightest.

1287~~~
Chelsea will sit really narrow, and we'd struggle to play through them. Rafael will be occupied by Hazard, there are no guarantees that Shaw will do a lot going forward. We'd really really lack width.

I agree that Di Maria's wasted on the wing, but we aren't in a great position at the moment.
I'd take van Persie out and put Valencia wide right; Di Maria wide left.
If Carrick isn't ready we're in a bit of trouble, in my opinion, because Herrera isn't equipped to play as part of the base.

1288~~~
Also, I wouldn't say that Di Maria is 'wasted' on the left against Chelsea - having a world class player to deal with will keep Ivanovic busy and that shouldn't be underestimated in it's worth!

1289~~~
I'd say it's more likely we'll lose both than get any points from either of them.

1290~~~
How I look at it is that RVP, Falcao and Mata have/ had 3 games to prove themselves with one remaining. Whoever performs worst will most likely be replaced by Rooney on his return from suspension.
Since LVG stated that he does not seen Rooney as a striker the onus is on Mata to deliver more than the other 2.

1291~~~
Are you this pessimistic about everything? You'd think we were some pub team with shit players. Playing 2 games, 1 at home, I'd be very surprised if we got 0 points from the 2. I'm not saying we're better then either, but we are playing at home, we are never under dogs at home, especially not when we have players like De Gea, Herrera, Di Maria, Falcao, Van Persie (regardless of form), and everyone else.

1292~~~
Yes.

We're playing the runaway league leaders at home, we got easily beaten by them last time we played them (granted away from home) and they've strengthened perfectly over the summer. They're one of the world's best teams, we're not. We are underdogs, regardless of it being a home game, we'd be underdogs against City, Real, Barça, Bayern, etc so to say we're never is ridiculous.

We're horrific defensively and too open in midfield, even with Herrera, Di Maria, Blind etc the likes of West Brom, West Ham and so on have been carving through us at will so what the hell do you think Chelsea and City (especially City, Yaya versus our midfield and Aguero against our defence is going to be embarrassing) are going to do to us?

We're obviously going to lose both matches but we're not competing with Chelsea nor City yet so we shouldn't worry about it. Sad state of affairs but it's the truth.

And how can it be 'regardless of form'. Names mean feck all if they're not performing. RVP isn't performing and he'll be next to useless against City and Chelsea given he's been next to useless against everyone else. At least, unless he isn't truly done and remembers who the feck he is.

1293~~~
Van Persie has single handily destroyed Chelsea in the past (Good old days) But if he starts on Sunday i'll be pretty annoyed. LVG and RVP love affair is getting on my nerves now tbh, I can't believe Falcao was dropped to the bench with some silly jet lag excuse, when he was pretty much in perfect form scoring 3 goals in 3 games for club and country.

We need to play Falcao with a strong and stacked midfield behind him to close the gaps, if we play with 2 strikers on Sunday, Chelsea will massacre us.

1294~~~
So because we aren't as good as them that means they will win? That's not how football works. We're playing at Old Trafford and with a team like ours (a very good one, just a new one so its disjointed at times), we have a chance against everyone. It's not like Chelsea have superior players in every position, they clearly don't. Anyways, teams don't just roll over because they aren't as good as another team at that point. Stoke beat City at the etihad this season. We are a much, much better team then Stoke. It's unlikely we'll get a result at the etihad, I feel like we've struggled there always (though we got a decent amount of good results there with Fergie), but at home against Chelsea I think we'll definitely get something out of the match. 

It really is amazing how much Moyes has ruined everyones confidence. How many times have we come up against superior players but came away with a result? It's just a matter of our players being on their game, and if they are, then I don't care who we are playing, Madrid, Barca, Bayern, Chelsea or City (who are nowhere close to the first 3), we have a good chance to win, and that's because of the quality of the players we have in our team now.

1295~~~

1296~~~
Not sure I'd put it down to luck, or an absence of luck.

1297~~~
I think he'll score tomorrow.

1298~~~
I really hope Falcao starts......Van Persie had his chances in the last games and wasn't good enough (He was poor for the Netherlands too in their last games)

1299~~~
Hopefully mind-games from Van Gaal - talking only of Van Persie and not mentioning Falcao...

I really, really hope Falcao starts the Chelsea match as lone striker.

1300~~~
As much as I'm a big fan of his, I still find it amazing he's starting games for us instead of Falcao.

1301~~~
It's not the fact RVP isn't scoring that is particularly worrying to me, it is his all round performances. I mean Rooney plays poorly and scores, he's done that for th least few years. We need a more complete all round game from your striker at this level and from what we've seen Falcao is paying better than RVP who is doing almost NOTHING out there. This isn't just one match it has been this way for a while. his best game for Holland was against Spain so the World Cup really isn't a valid way of proving any point to me. He will start against Chelsea and if at a also starts we have lost.

1302~~~
Absolutely. I love RvP but I'll throw a fit if he starts tomorrow!

1303~~~
He's been shit. I didn't expect van Gaal to mollycoddle around him like this, just because he's Dutch. No special privileges, eh.

1304~~~
Well during Rooney's absence he's been given the captain armband and the captain has the 'special blablabla' so I absolutely expect him to start against Chelsea.

1305~~~
No doubt the Board want us to be in top 4 at the end of the season, so its time we start to perform against our direct rivals. Louis will take a huge risk if he starts RvP on Sunday, and if the risk does not pay off, the game against City will be even ore stressful. I hope Falcao starts, as I am sure he has more to offer than RvP. If we start both RvP and Mata, I expect the Chavs to win the game in the first half.

1306~~~
<i>Last season Van Persie suffered nine separate injuries but still managed 12 goals in 18 Premier League starts. In the previous, title-winning year there were 26 in 35. These figures may be why the manager is adamant his star forward is not past his peak. “He has showed that at the World Cup and <b>is showing that now except scoring goals but that is only a matter of time,” said Van Gaal before outlining Van Persie’s all-round contribution.</b> “Every striker has to be at the attacking point. He has to play with the other 10 players. That is also important. <b>That he is now doing better than in Dutch team.”</b></i>



Really don't agree with that from LVG. RVP's overall contribution has been disappointing this campaign so far and he has been anonymous for most of the matches he played in. I'm just not seeing the hold-up play, dropping deep, terrific passing and link-up play of the old complete RVP. This version of RVP has regressed but I really hope that is due to a blip in form and not him being past his peak. Oh and I'm not asking LVG to throw RVP under the bus in the media, like what Rodgers did to Balotelli but perhaps he could start playing RVP on the basis of his form.

1307~~~
I doubt he actually believes what he is saying though, it's more a case of talking up his striker to build confidence. Much like Rodgers is doing with Balotelli at the moment.

1308~~~
Yeah hope so but it looks like RVP is going to get a free pass till he regains his form, when it would be actually better for the team and RVP himself if he were to be dropped for a game or two.

1309~~~
It's due to Falcao's fitness more than anything else. It takes a long time to fully regain your fitness after an ACL. Hopefully Falcao can get to a stage where he can last a full 90 minutes sooner rather than later because he looks better than RVP at the moment. 

Think RVP will come good though. All players go through rough patches just more attention is drawn to it when you're one of the biggest names in the league.

1310~~~
As someone else said, he's never really been the same since Fergie left. I think it really hit him hard, but...well.....for what he earns a week, he just needs to get over it. I can understand him being disillusioned with Moyes, but he respects and supports LVG - hopefully he'll get his edge back soon...

1311~~~
Those quotes from LVG are genuinely quite worrying, and they do seem to back the theory that RVP is getting special treatment.

West Ham game aside, he's been pretty crap this season. Nothing to do with bad luck.

1312~~~
I hope Van Gaal doesn't really believe what he's saying or that is a pretty worrying assessment.

1313~~~
I wouldn't take everything said at face value. He's not blind, he knows RVP is not performing to the standard expected - for whatever reason. However, it would be counter-productive to slag him (or any other player) off publicly as the player will lose confidence etc. Plus no matter how he feels about RVP, if he does not up his performances then LVG will have no choice but to drop him. The club just cannot afford this at the moment, there's too much pressure and LVG knows this better than anyone else.

1314~~~
When you couple his quotes with the fact that RVP seems untouchable on the pitch and never gets subbed, I'm inclined to think he is actually happy with what he sees.

1315~~~
Hopefully that is just standard manager bluffing with LvG.

1316~~~
I understand what you're saying, but as I mentioned as well, if that is what he truly believes, then he will have no choice but to drop RVP eventually - he'll have no choice. We're under too much pressure for him to indulge RVP forever. I am however, prepared to be patient tomorrow and see if RVP rises to the occasion. I have a funny feeling him along with Mata are on trial somehow, and need to really get their sh*t together.

1317~~~
Sounds a bit overly dramatic but what the hey: Could LvG's favouritism of RvP actually end up costing him his job?

I mean, starting him and playing him for 90 mins is quite possibly <i>costing us points</i>. Pull that against top 4 rivals and if RvP's complete invisibility continues we'll be dropping points in 6 pointer games - finish outside the top 4 and LvG could well be gone.

Like I said, bit overly dramatic, but if he starts him against Chelsea and City (and RvP does nothing) I'd certainly revisit this question!

1318~~~
Don't know about costing him his job... however, it's a tricky situation I believe with strikers. I remember after starting brilliantly for us when we last won the title, RVP went through a little phase and stopped scoring. Of course it didn't matter then as it does now, however I believe once he got the first goal again after that 'drought' he went and hugged Fergie, more from relief than anything. Think later Fergie commented on encouraging him and trying to make see that him not scoring was temporary and I guess urging him to be patient. Of course Fergie showed faith in him and continued playing him and of course it worked. I guess LVG is trying to do the same thing, and it wouldn't be a big problem except we are in a completely different situation. I think it's difficult for a manager to manage a situation like this.

1319~~~
The problem is, its not just because he's not scoring much that people are concerned. Its how crap his overall game has become.

1320~~~
if someone didn't watch the matches and read this thread, one might think Falcao and Mata have been outstanding so far. That's not the case. What's this nonsense about favouritism? If you prefer a player to start, mainly based on hope and expectation because of his name, and the manager prefers the other,  that means either you or the manager got it wrong. Sometimes managers get it wrong, and sometimes even Van Gaal gets it wrong, but the suggestion that a manager who doesn't agree with some fan is guilty of favouratism is just plain stupid.

1321~~~
RVP has neither being playing as bad as some say or invisible our players simply need to pass him the ball more. I hope Falcao is fit enough to play because at least he looks to set up RVP.
I don't know why some wish to place unnecessary pressure on RVP. He is the best centre forward we have had since RVN.

1322~~~
Needs to be really up for it if Falcao's out as is being reported.

1323~~~
I hope he plays a blinder today. We really need him on song. He has it in him, or at least he used to, to decide the outcome of matches like these!

1324~~~
Might help if we use Valencia on the right wing. In his debut season with us he absolutely fed off of a lot of those crosses from the right wing

1325~~~
Put it this way, I wish for the pressure on RvP to be lessened significantly over the next two games...

1326~~~
About bloody time he finds the back of the net. He's always up for a big game so should be fired up. C'mon Robin. Rediscover your class.

1327~~~
Really need Mata and Fellaini to offer him support and fill spaces in the box with him. If we end up with him trying to find space in the box whilst everyone else is sitting outside we will fail to threaten at all.

1328~~~
Much better today, shame about that miss, but his overall play has been very good.

1329~~~
Good first 25 minutes or so despite missing that one on one. Last 20 minutes he has dropped off a little and is doing that infuriating thing where he takes too long on the ball and runs back towards our goal before playing a poor pass. But better than the last game for sure. Also looks to be working much harder.

1330~~~
Hasn't received much service, but also squandered a chance by not feeding Mata's run through the middle earlier.

1331~~~
Good hold up play so far. Some decent runs too.

1332~~~
Finally his build up play is at least close to his best, now he needs to start burrying those chances.

1333~~~
Much better from him today. His movement today is much sharper, shame about the finishing though

1334~~~
He's done about as much as you could expect so far. Good keeping denied him.

1335~~~
I thought he was one of our best players. Great movement throughout, terrific hold up play and a near-flawless touch. Sadly the one time his touch let him down was that first chance. Better than Falcao's played in any half this seaaon.

1336~~~
I almost saw how he chipped that ball over the keeper, but he hit it low <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Why?

1337~~~
Good, strong build up play - actually been a presence for Terry and Cahill to deal with.

1338~~~
It's the third/fourth time this season he has missed such a chance, vs Burnley, vs west brom, vs chelsea and at Holland, this isnt him being unlucky but he just doesnt have it anymore it seems, but the runs I talked about, this is a proper example of it, Falcao would probably score, but he wouldnt be in that position/make that run.

1339~~~
Hold up play and touch much better compared to last games.

Lethal touch still lacking.

1340~~~
Decent half today but yet another easy chance goes begging.

1341~~~
Needs to lay it off quicker when he's holding it up. Also needs to start putting away these chances he engineers with his great runs. Good to see him more involved generally.

1342~~~
Best so far this season probably. Really strong on the ball. The chance he missed wasn´t easy and the backwards header was an easy save for Courtois but with an average PL goalkeeper could have gone in. He can still do better, but this is looking much better than in previous games. It´s not really helping him that they´re barely putting any decent crosses in either.

1343~~~
His hold up play and winning high up the pitch has been excellent. 

Should have finished that chance, but really pleased with his performance today.

1344~~~
Much much better. Everything is sticking again, and he's looking a lot sharper and faster with his movement.

More of the same please Robin.

1345~~~
Its frustrating to watch all the wing play not ending up in a cross or pass into RVP. He really is looking sharp.

1346~~~
Doing well considering he is marooned upfront against cahill/terry. Missed a glorious chance when put through by Januzaj which I thought he would have put away had he been in better form.

We just need to get the ball to him in scoring positions. Not doing that enough as we are dallying on our crosses.

1347~~~
Very good in the first half. That chance was not so easy as some here make it out to be, Courtois did very well to close him down.

1348~~~
<a class="username" data-user="28415, @Sam" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28415/">@Sam</a> will still be banging the Welbeck drum

1349~~~
Good performance but can't believe he slipped when played in on his left foot. That's the sort of chance he's trained for (and mastered) his entire career.

1350~~~
....

1351~~~
Impressive performance so far. Perhaps needs to improve his finishing a tad, but his overall play is a lot better than it has been in recent times which is a positive. Hopefully we'll get more of the same from him.

1352~~~
Most ironic post ever

1353~~~
Not sure what's happened but he's nowhere near the level he used to be, he's barely at a level good enough for a premier league striker at the moment, he looks slow, unfit and unmotivated.

1354~~~
Very mediocre.

1355~~~
Another pethetic performance. Needs to be dropped. 

Start Wilson for fcuks sake.

1356~~~
Faded out towards the end a bit, but he was quite impressive in the 1st half and looked sharper than he has all season. Certainly not a pathetic performance.

1357~~~
Barely good enough for the premier league? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What has he done wrong today? We've barely created anything...

1358~~~
;drool:

hahahah

1359~~~
Yessssssssss!!!!

1360~~~
Yasssssss!

1361~~~
Sorry RVP, please forgive me for all my shit talking about you recently.

1362~~~
You can tell he needed that goal for his confidence. Hopefully it will kick off into a spree.

1363~~~
The only pathetic thing has been the reactions in here. Falcao has that game and people here are purring.

1364~~~
He's back! Class game.

1365~~~
Played well and lead the line so deserved that goal

1366~~~
Fantastic from RVP.

Brillaint hold up play and the reaction for the goal says it all.

The haters can feck off.

1367~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69549, @DWelbz19" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69549/">@DWelbz19</a>  not such a bad statement by me wasnt it, one of the best players today.

1368~~~
Yeah, he was a lot better than some people were giving him credit for. Really glad he got his goal at the end. Still not at his very best, but undoubtedly more impressive than he's been. Delighted.

1369~~~
Deserved that goal, happy for him.

1370~~~
Hate to say I told you so <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1371~~~
Somewhat proved me wrong today with that last minute equalizer, though overally I still thought he was far from his best. I hope that goal acts as a confidence booster for upcoming games.

1372~~~
feck yes!!!!!!!! First half was the best he's played for a while, he was poor for much of the second half but so was the whole team. Feel a bit more confident that he can come back to close to his best with how he played in the first 45 and the confidence he'll get from such a big goal.

1373~~~
YOU BEAUTIFUL MAN

1374~~~
Had a little fighting spirit in him today but I still found his play a little frustrating in the 1st half. Anyways, thank feck for Robin van Persie.

1375~~~
I was slating Fellaini pre-Monday so I won't get at people who criticised RVP because one goal doesn't change everything, but he has been getting a lot of over the top stick here lately. Really pleased he got that goal.

1376~~~
No doubt he's not at his best an he made more mistakes as he looked knackered at the end. The most worrying thing hasn't been his lack of goals but that his normally fantastic touch and hold up play was poor. It wasn't for the most part today.

1377~~~
Had a tough job today and played the CF bit very well. Very pleased for him.

1378~~~
Thought he did well, second half the team, De Gea aside, were poor, but he got his goal and put in a good first half performance I thought!

1379~~~
Very happy for his goal, meant shitloads for him.

1380~~~
He had a great game. (Apart from missing that chance in the first half).

I actually think he can have more of an influence for us playing a bit deeper. There's more room for him, more time for him to pick his spot/pass. 

He is quality.

1381~~~
Played well. Should've scored in the first half, but credit to Courtois. Deserved his goal.

1382~~~
Best game for a long while. I think he is back.

1383~~~
Exactly. For someone who's largely been playing poor, he's still scoring. Not a ridiculous amount admittedly, but he's not really gone on a barren run this season which is positive.

1384~~~
THAT CELEBRATION <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1385~~~
Need a GIF of the celebration

1386~~~
He needed that, oh how he needed that. 
Had a good game overall imo, the best since the season started.

1387~~~
Spot on. People were on about how he lost body control and was too easily shrugged off the ball. Today he went toe to toe with Terry and Cahill and came out as the winner most of the time. Great control of the ball and some very great runs as well.

1388~~~
Been critical of him all season but really pleased for him. Obviously meant a lot. A simple goal in the end but might kick-start his season. Fingers crossed anyway.

1389~~~
He was good today. He held up the ball very well, and tested the goal keeper few times and had a goal. But because it has become fashionable, some peole will still come here and moan about his performance.

1390~~~
He's definitely not 'back'. He still looks a little off form but he did much better today than recent weeks and I'm delighted he got the goal. Even though I still think he looks like he's struggling with his legs for whatever reason he still got his goal and had some nice hold up play, particularly in the first half.
I love his passion

1391~~~
Yes, gif please. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1392~~~
Maybe it's just me but he seems a lot better as a loan striker, rather than being coupled with someone.

1393~~~
I think the World Cup really took a lot out of him. Hopefully this goal sparks him back into life, he really needed it.

1394~~~
Best game this season. Still our best striker, no-one can tell me otherwise. Love the man.

1395~~~
It wasn't brilliant, but I wonder when was the last time Falcao had a better game at a comparable level.

1396~~~
Fair fecks to RvP. He needed that badly.

1397~~~
Told you all he'd have a good game.

Prophet.

1398~~~
I love his post match conference. Shreeves mentioning that Ivanovic would've marked Fellaini on the goal to which he said "it makes it even better for us!"

1400~~~
He deserved this goal for his workrate. He´s working his ass of fighting against 2 defenders all the time. He´s not really getting much of support as Mata was dropping deep most of the time. With Di Maria and Januzaj barely putting any crosses in at all it´s also virtually impossible for him to make an impact in front of goal. He got some chances with some good runs, but those were not easy chances by any means. He really needed this goal. He seemed angry when he hit that ball. Poor ball. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1401~~~
His hold up play in the first half was excellent, much better than anything we've seen from him this season. Kept the ball and passed well to open Chelsea up a few times that first half. I'm sure that goal will give him the boost he needed.

1402~~~
Probably his best performance in about 6 months. He was genuinely fantastic, and deserved that goal.

1403~~~
He could've had 2 or 3 but I don't mind.

That he's getting into those positions and forcing saves is enough. That's all he needs and the rest will come. Deserved goal.

1404~~~
His best game in months, boy did he need that goal! Brilliant hold up play, always available to pickup a pass, kept himself on always. Perhaps his finishing could have been better, it's RvP we're talking about! One thing he continues to annoy me at is those stupid fouls he concedes that often let the defenders off the hook. I know he's always been like that, but that's killing our chances especially when we're chasing the games.

1405~~~
We need a GIF/video of that whole celebration. That summed up our whole fight and spirit today

1406~~~
Decent game from him. To call it his best performance in recent times doesn't really say much though.

His influence in build up play is minimal, but he was secure and astute with the ball today and his touch was excellent. He squandered two other brilliant chances and put forward a pretty lame effort at preventing Drogba's opener. Defensively speaking he was probably poor too, although it'd be better to let that slide. I don't really remember him winning anything in the air either, but fouls are a staple of his current game so they at least were to be expected.

I'm not his biggest fan, and smashing a fortunate rebound past a rattled Courtois isn't really going to change that. Hopefully the confidence from that will help counter his torpidity as games draw into later stages.

1407~~~
Big improvement today but I still don't think his general form merits a place in our starting eleven when everyone is fit.

1408~~~
That sentence is fairly redundant when you read the rest of the post. Against a team as good as Chelsea that was a very good performance for a striker.

1409~~~
Did decent enough. The goal will be huge for him and us IMO, a huge boost of confidence. Missed a few chances before hand, could have also done better for their goal on the line. Hold up play and link up play was much better though.

1410~~~
I'd bring Rooney in for RVP and Herrera in for Mata for City.

1411~~~
That was a van Persie performance right there. He looked strong, he put himself about and in the end he was in the right place to get his goal.

The supply and delivery was poor all game so he's done well to get himself a goal in the end.

1412~~~
True. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1413~~~
Delighted for him.

1414~~~
Delighted for him, massive massive goal, can see him getting back to his best very soon now.

1415~~~
Van Persie at his best wins us that game with the chances he had.

Anyway, his movement and touch were much better today. Why does he gas so early in the 2nd half though ? Seemingly becoming a pattern.

1416~~~
I think the goal will paper over a lot of cracks. He had a very good first half but was rather invisible in the second and made a lot of annoying and unnecessary fouls that killed our attack. Hopefully the goal gives him a bit off a boost though and he kicks on. Wish he'd power into his shots like he did for the equaliser.

1417~~~
You mean chances to score a brilliant goal? I don't see a lot of goals from those angles, with the keeper that close.

1418~~~
Pleased for him to get the goal and everything but lets be honest. He wouldn't have been on the pitch if Rooney/Falcao was fit. Still looks like there is something holding him back.

1419~~~
Much better today but could have been better, needs to become more clinical.

1420~~~
Hopefully he starts to score from those chances he had in the first half

1421~~~
Loved the whole sequence- the ball falls to him and he SMASHED it as hard as he could. The accuracy didn't matter, you could feel the anger. And then the celebration.

This kind of goal will make all fans love him again. it certainly did for me <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1422~~~
Was pretty good in the first half with nice touches, great movement and hold-up play, an aspect was lacking throughout this season and maybe even the last one. Just needs to be a bit more clinical with the chances he gets. You'd back the lethal RVP of 2 years ago, to put away most of the chances he got. Faded away in the second half but it was understandable given our lack of chance creation and urgency in the final third, with him being rather isolated at times. Decent performance overall and hopefully he builds on it to reach his 2011-2013 level.

1423~~~

1424~~~
He scored so his detractors are eating some of their previous words. I am still not happy with his service. To me RVP had never lost his abilities the problem was midfielders going for glory themselves and not feeding him the ball. In the WC Robben and Sneijder hardly passed to him. With UTD, Rooney and Mata. Even today DiMaria and Januzay were poor suppliers. What was even more amazing is that many times Fellaini was also in the box with RVP yet the crosses did not reach them or were driven low and towards the goal.
Ok maybe Ivanovic was not there but the first decent delivery into the box got both Felaini and RVP involved.

1425~~~
As I mentioned earlier, the celebration was somewhat reminiscent of Ruuds against Arsenal about 10 years ago this week. Goosebumps <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1426~~~
Well, everyone was cryitical on him because he was actually playing poorly for long time, but today he had a very good game, even though he had that poor miss or two. Glad to see him playing like this, let's hope he continues like this.

1427~~~
He's peed me off of late with his performances, but I think he was much better than he has been today. The goal of course adds to it, but he seemed to be more involved to me.

Tired towards the end, but thankfully still had enough in the tank to smash it in. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1428~~~
What exactly have you proven? A decent first half performance in which he did well with his hold-up play but squandered two very, very good chances put to him by Januzaj was then met with a quiet second half, only to fortunately find himself on the end of a scrappy set piece? It was better than what he has been showing, but that was hardly a good performance. Let's hope the goal gets him back into form, because it's clear that only some sort of nuclear disaster will keep him out of the side.

1429~~~
I don't think his miss was as glaring as some posters have made it out to be. Courtois was off his line very quickly and it wasn't the best angle. Not an easy chance at all.

1430~~~
He got the goal, so that was good, obviously, but what is up with his fitness these days? He was looking knackered almost around the hour mark.

1431~~~
Have never understood the haters on here. If you want the ball to fall at someones feet then 9 times out of 10 you would want it to be RVP. Great game and that goal will boost his energy and confidence no end. Also said before the game I thought Fellaini would have a really great game...and that he did. Seems like he's also gained confidence recently...probably due to his determination to prove some doubters wrong. Long may it continue. He's a physical player...and by goodness we need some of that in our team..

1432~~~
This made me laugh

1433~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1434~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It was a better performance from him, but I still don't think he was great. Definitely want to see Rooney up top vs City.

1435~~~
He should have dribbled it around Courtois as the space to do that was definitely there. Don't think Van Persie new he came out so far and went down so quickly. 

Either way, a 1 on 1 and a striker of his quality will always expect to score it.

1436~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1437~~~
Strange.

1438~~~
Glad he scored, and it was a better performance than we've seen in a while, but I still think Rooney and Falcao should play next week.

1439~~~
That goal just brought RvP another 5-7 games but I think we'll see all three possibly play. Can't see Mata starting away to City.

1440~~~
I think he has shown signs of this type of performance for the last couple of weeks. The team as a whole is getting better as well.

1441~~~
Shades of old from him in the first half today, which was great to see. He held up the ball very well, even though he didn't have much else to work with.

In the second half I thought he struggled a bit more, similar to what we've seen from him of late. That goal will probably do him a lot of good, but it will be interesting to see what happens now that Rooney's back, should Falcao eventually get fit. I doubt we'll accommodate all three of them against City.

1442~~~
Pleased for him to get the goal but looks like a busted flush after an hour! Hold up play was very good today though!

1443~~~
RVP's performance today was better then anything Falcao has produced so far. He defiantly doesn't deserve to be dropped after today.

1444~~~
we'll probably see all three, and to be fair, I think when we had all three in that one game, they did quite well together, didn't they?

Plus it means we can put Di Maria back in the middle.

1445~~~
Today was about the 5th time this season he has missed a one and one once clear through. Thats nothing to do with the service is it.

He isn't having a good season in front of goal. Thats why some people are after him. His movement is still excellent though.

1446~~~
I hope that's what we play as well. Would prefer Rooney Falcao up top for the extra man in midfield but RvP won't be dropped after today. So the 3 of them up top with Rooney dropping back to help out and Fellu and Blind in midfield with Adm . No space for Herrera though.

1447~~~
Great in the first half, useless in the second till the goal.

1448~~~

1449~~~
Pleased for RVP. He didn't give up all game which was great to see. Yes he's still not quite clinical enough, but so pleased and hope it gives his confidence a boost.

1450~~~

Love this image, shame about the watermark though

1451~~~
More what I said about the chances, he is making those runs, he is the only one making them..

1452~~~
I'm glad he scored, but his failure to square the ball to both Mata and Wilson in both halves have arguably cost us points. They were in better positions from memory. Greedy.

1453~~~
Thank you! The angle of the shot was very hard and he didn't have enough time to take a look where Courtois was. The only things he could have done aside from what he did was try to round the keeper or chip him -- both without even looking at where Courtois was. He took a shot that would have been lucky to sneak in, but I don't even think 12-13 Van Persie would have made that chance. 

Any type of Van Persie would have finished Hazard's breakaway before the Drogba goal though...

1454~~~
Much better hold up play and much sharper off the mark today, if we'd had more pace on the right and more pace supporting from midfield he wouldn't have been as isolated as he was at times.

1455~~~
In hindsight your right BUT I like my strikers greedy and confident lol

1456~~~
It seems that after every chance he misses there is a group of posters that come here and complain how it was an easy chance and the mythical RVP 12/13 would have scored that with his eyes closed...

Also he just put on a performance better that any performance put in by Mata, Rooney or Falcao this season and I read through theis thread and some people want him dropped for City... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Btw, since he is here he scored in every single big game we won in the last 2 years. So, yeah, let's drop him.

1457~~~
You could tell that goal meant the world to him. Well played Robin.

1458~~~
Will be great for his confidence, especially after his post shot last week. An inform RvP would be massive going forward.

1459~~~
Like the West Brom game, I think his overall play is getting a lot better but his finishing still doesn't fill me with confidence at the moment. Both times he went through, the only thing I expected was the shot to hit the keeper. However, for him to pop up with such an important goal shows how important he still is and I can easily forget the other two chances. It was great to see.

1460~~~
He wasn't bad. Think he tired a fair bit halfway through the second half. His touch was better today and he seemed to be fighting for more balls. Still think his build-up play is lacking but hopefully he can keep improving.

1461~~~
It had a touch of the RVN Arsenal penalty about it. Albeit for totally different reasons.

1462~~~
Anyone got a gif of his lopping header that nearly caught out Courtois? Would have been the goal of the season!

1463~~~
Are you thinking of Wilson's? His was more looping than RvP's was. But RvP's was a really good effort considering his body position.

1464~~~
I'm as guilty as anyone, 60-70 minutes in i was bemoaning Falcao's injury, that he couldn't come on and offer something else. In hindsight, and with a clearer head i'm not sure what good it would have done. Our rare ventures forward used him frequently with his hold up play, most good things we had on the front foot came through him. 

Was delighted for him to get his goal, you could see what it meant to him.

1465~~~
Honestly thought that was in. Courtois is a freak of nature, what a keeper he is. Going to get better too.

1466~~~
That header would have caused pretty much any other keeper huge problems, can you imagine a keeper of Casilas' size trying to keep it out?, yet Courtois just plucks it out the air like its a routine catch. The bastard.

1467~~~
I know right. I was waiting for his arms to drop when his legs came back down to earth...

But they were already there!

1468~~~
His touch was a lot better today as well, at least 5 times he brought down lofty passes really silkily.

The more time has passed since the game today the more impressed I feel with his performance leading the line against the best defence in the league.

1469~~~

1470~~~
I keep referring to LVG's philosophy of giving players the opportunity to prove themselves. Well today RVP did just that. 
LVG will not drop him nor should he because RVP is still a class above most strikers. His first touch is still very good and if the players keep looking to pass to him he will deliver.

1471~~~
Let's hope he finds his best form now and he and Falcao gel together

1472~~~
People really underestimate his strength and hold up play and how vital it is. Rooney can't do it, he's mostly been terrible when he has his back to goal.  Falcao got physically overpowered a few times in the West Brom game. His finishing has never been at the Falcao or even Rooney level but his other talents balance it out. 

Both he and Rooney are ahead of Falcao in the pecking order for me.

1473~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/krJybBeFG34?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

"Makes it better for us, no?"

I love that answer. Because really, from a United point of view, who the feck cares Ivanovic was sent off?

Also, is he going the Van Gaal hairstyle nowadays?

1474~~~
Does seem to be change in his game or low in confidence, he's trying all these cute finishes and passing the ball into the net when getting into 1v1 situations, the old Van Persie would smash those balls into the top corners.

1475~~~
Some of his play with back to goal was just sublime. More of that, please.

1476~~~
So, do we love him again now? I'm struggling to keep up

1477~~~
Just what he needed before the derby, he will be fired up for Sunday.

1478~~~
Always loved this fella. Don't think the criticism he's had this year has been justified. Granted, he hasn't been his usual amazing self, but he's still scoring and he's still making things happen. Did very well as a lone centre forward yesterday.

There are many clichés in football, but one truly resonates with RvP: form is temporary, class is permanent.

And it was just epic to hear Ooooh Robin van Persie belting through the stands at full time yesterday. He shares a special relationship with us all.

1479~~~
Smashed that ball in like he was shattering all his demons in one go. Fingers crossed he can keep up this form. Happy for him that he got a goal. Still want to see Falcao start in a match instead of him though, just to see how that works out.

1480~~~
The difference in his body language from last year is so stark.. Remember him mumbling about people being in his space last year and this year he is buzzing in all interviews..

1481~~~
RVP is not a player who can play the lone striker role. He hasnt got the energy, and is far more dangerous when he has someone else making the spaces for him to exploit. That said he was great yesterday, and did it better than I've seen him do previously. Made up that he was in the right position to pounce for the goal, he deserved that

1482~~~
He was clearly up for it yesterday, and hopefully it means he's back, and that it wasn't just a Chelsea match jolting him out of indifference.

His touch was far more crisp, he got on the ball more, he got a few shots off... Still not RvP of 12-13, but I've been desperate for him to show as much as he did yesterday just in terms of his technique and involvement.

1483~~~
No one can question his movement. Its exceptional.

1484~~~
His movement was good, but he needs to fecking pass the ball sometimes. On the replays, you can see his head never goes up once he gets a sniff at goal; we could have had at least a couple of tap-ins if he had a look.

1485~~~
He has always taken chances like that and missed a lot of them. That's because they're not really good chances, the first one on one he needed to chip the ball to pass the close Courtois. That would have been a brilliant goal. The second he hardly any angle, sometimes he scores from there, but most strikers don't even try because it's got to be shot very hard and very accurate.

1486~~~
Intensity at a different level yesterday. Much happier with that performance.

1487~~~
Im sure if he hadnt scored the goal, everyone would have been calling for him to be dropped, he got lucky with rebound

Still not impressed with him, so many times when he gets ball, he spends to long with and back pedals too much

1488~~~
Looked a bit more like his old self last night, and you can't argue with an equalising goal. It was always way too early to be writing him off, and we need him in tip-top form if we're to challenge for a place in the top 3.

1489~~~
I still thought he was very frustrating yesterday. The goal, a nice backward header and some decent hold up play apart, he wasted many chances you'd expect him to finish, kept fouling everyone when we were a goal down and still looked disinterested up until the last 10 minutes.

1490~~~
Some of you guys are ridiculous slating RvP after yesterday's performance.

We played a very, very strong Chelsea team. RvP's hold up play was excellent, and he won the ball high up the pitch for us a good few times. He missed one or two chances, but he was up against one of the world's best keepers. The chance in the first half was the only one where I thought he would score, and all it needed was a bit more finesse. But his performance yesterday was brilliant.

I said earlier, I think when he drops a little deeper, he's a lot more dangerous.

Anyway, he put in a great shift yesterday, and I hope to see more of the same.

1491~~~
I thought he was great yesterday, just Mata couldn't get forward quick enough to help support him.

1492~~~
He needs to belt or smash the ball into the net when he's on a one on one. There were a few chances of those the last two games when he was through facing the goalkeeper and either he miskicks it slightly or just shoots tamely at the keeper's legs. Very poor by his standards

1493~~~
I thought he played well last night but there was one thing that did annoy me. When he was holding up the ball, there was often runners ahead of him or central who were the better and more direct options but every time he chose to play the ball wide and give himself time to get in the box. I think we'd have had more success of he looked to get the ball to those players quicker and accept that he wouldn't be near to the goalmouth action. It seemed a bit selfish.

I used to play with a striker who would do similar, he could put you clear through on goal but every time he's play it a bit too wide leaving you the only option of crossing or squaring it back to him.

1494~~~
To be fair, he's always missed sitters and one on ones. Even at his absolute peak.
Scores the impossible ones, often misses the easier ones.
I think he laces when he should place, and sometimes places when he should lace.

He looked much better yesterday. He was given the space he needs, and actually fought for the ball for the first half.

1495~~~
Looked very tired after their goal, suppose that was most the team as it was Chelsea who played keep ball. But didn't half come alive for his goal. Unlucky not to have 2, 3 or even 4 as it turns out. But their keeper did his job well yesterday. 
Much improved yesterday was happy with him, delighted he got his goal. Was well deserved. Shackles off? Anybody?

1496~~~
His general play was good, but messed up execution and took the wrong decision a few times. He was obviously desperate to score and prove a point and glad he did in the end. He needs to get his lethal streak back somehow though. Score some worldie at Etihad and I'll believe he is back.

1497~~~
Yesterday was one of those games where strikers don't look good. For both teams the game was all about trying to control the midfield and occasionally break forward to support the striker. He got very little support and service over the 90 mins, but still got involved and held up the ball well, made some good runs.

He should have scored first half though.

1498~~~
Apparently took all the players kids for a kick about after the game. Class guy, can't understand the complains after the game. We were playing Chelski, the run away leaders, sureshot title winners, the global warming deliverers and AIDS Ebola cure providers all rolled into one. What did we expect?

1499~~~
That goal might just bang him back into top form with a little luck. He's still our best striker when at his best, absolutely unplayable.

1500~~~
Behind falcao hes going to be immense,he was very unluky not to bag at least another goal yesterday.

1501~~~
I thought as a player he had a good game....as someone who's main attribute is meant to be finishing he was a bit shit.

1502~~~
Hehe... Was watching some footballer sprints, and came across this:
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QAyeSUvT4Zk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1503~~~
Was more about the pass to Higuian. Perhaps a bit overweighted to ensure he had to cross it.
Maybe I'm being harsh..

1504~~~
Sorry I was with my mind on the speed topic, my bad.

1505~~~
I don't know what people expect of him as a lone striker, he did exactly what was needed from him. He might not be the fastest or most aggressive but his positioning and his runs were excellent. Thing are not going his way at the moment but as long as he keeps on doing what he is it will come good for him, we saw what that goal ment to him. As of now though I'd like Falcao to start ahead of him, having RVP on the bench would be class.

1506~~~
I noticed that he don't look at the goalkeeper anymore. When he have a chance he just hit it without looking where the goalkeeper is. Good example is his chance yesterday when he could lob Courtois or pass it to Mata if he would raised his head but he didn't even looked what is happening, he just hit it.

As far as i remember he was not like that year or two ago.

1507~~~
Just imagine if he hits his old form? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1508~~~
Was one of the biggest eye-openers for me during his first season here. There was a sequence yesterday where he had two Chelsea defenders clinging on to him and he still managed to suck the goal kick in and distribute the ball.

He's a tank up front.

1509~~~
Yesterday wasn't a game set up for strikers to excel, even though they both scored.  Van Persie was OK in the circumstances.  Anyway, Van Gaal likes him and is not going to drop him, and he doesn't need resting when there is only one game a week.

1510~~~

1511~~~
True. I've been quite harsh on him - I feel he was the only 'systematic' thing wrong with our performance against Chelsea, and Falcao would have made us more of a threat - but he probably had a narrowly better game than Drogba, who only seems to have got praise for his performance.

That said, I can't help watching this gif and thinking about what could have been if he'd just seen that damn square pass to Mata:

1512~~~
How could he have seen Mata? Grow some eyes on the back of his head? What he could have done better is go round the keeper or maybe chip him, imo.

1513~~~
Looking up, perhaps?

Precisely. I don't even think his movement has been poor over the course of the season. He perhaps like the sharpness he had in our title-winning season, but he has still gotten into excellent positions and had clear chances in nearly every game this season due to engineering space for himself off of the last defender and penetrating the defence. It's his overall play and contribution that has been severely lacking and of course, hi finishing in front of goal that would probably see him have at least another three goals if this was the RvP of 2012/13.

He's declined in a few aspects of his play and I certainly don't expect him to recapture those elements of his play that he once had, but his movement is still as exceptional as ever. Plus, his overall game was better against Chelsea, so hopefully that goal is a catalyst for performing to a consistently high level. I remain apprehensive, but that are positives.

1515~~~
Dont think anyone with your name should be even commenting on anything striker related to be honest........one two's maybe

1516~~~
It happened too fast, there was no way he had time to look up and check for players in better potions. Most probably if he had looked up, he no doubt wouldn't be able to pull the pass off and would have fecked up. The keeper was out like a shot and it was a spit second decision. Kind of funny, but there would be people who asked why didn't he shoot if he opted to have passed to Mata and fecked it up. RvP was well within the rights to take that shot on and is more than capable of pulling it off, it's juts this time it didn't work out.

EDIT: Also to add to the above after watching that gif again, with the angle of RvP's run and the direction of the pass, looking up is just not an option, he would have to turn his entire body to see him as he isn't running parallel with him, he's running diagonally away from Mata. If he turned to see Mata, the keeper would have been on top of him.

1517~~~
Quality.

1518~~~
His passing is very poor, so many times I've shouted at the TV for him to pass but he just dallys on the ball for to long! But yea his movement is very good

1519~~~
Baffles me why he was not our first choice corner kick taker anymore

1520~~~
It always surprised me that he wasn't in the box for the corners. Not necessarily to win headers (although he's not exactly short or poor in the air) but because he has a nose for being in the right place at the right time. The goal for Chelsea being the prime example.

1521~~~
It's a sign of his phsyical decline that he's no longer quick enough to take a corner, and then get on the end of it himself.

1522~~~
I don't get why Mata wasn't taking them. ADM and RvP are far more likely to get on a header than him.

Hopefully we'll see more of the same hold up play, movement and link up play displayed at Chelsea. Much better.

1526~~~
Regarding Monday, RvP wasn't excellent but his all round game was probably the best it has been all season. His hold up play was brilliant, everything that went up to him just seemed to stick, and after watching the MNF analysis (I think) it was obviously a tactic from us to have Mata and Fellaini dragging Matic and Fabregas slightly out of position to widen the gap between them, which then meant that the ball through the middle up to RvP was on. He's been a little unlucky that he has missed a few chances recently that you would expect an RvP in top form to bury. That said, confidence is crucial to strikers and I'd expect the Chelsea goal to give him a big boost. His hold up play will be equally as important against City - before news of the injury I was looking forward to Falcao vs Mangala but I'm hoping RvP continues his where he left off on Monday night.

1527~~~
Found this on YT earlier, let's hope for some counter attack and back to goal play more like this tomorrow:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1YuuOt_Vo3c?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1528~~~
He was simply fantastic that season. I find it very amusing when some people around here question the wisdom of buying him. That season alone was worth it.

1529~~~
I love his style of smashing the ball... in the most heterosexual way possible

1530~~~
I've been quite disappointed with RVP this season. His decision making has been quite poor by his standards. Often he is just too greedy and by the time he realises he needs to pass, the opposition have had time to find their shape again, and we either lose possession or go back to sideways passing, looking for another opening. 
 Van Gaal says his fitness levels are great but I think his sharpness is well below par for a man of his talent

1531~~~
Agree with that.

Their arguments fall into 3 main categories

<b>The signing gave less game time to Hernandez, Welbeck and maybe Kagawa, and put Rooney's nose out of joint.</b>

On the whole a I find United winning trophies more important then the personal careers of  individuals players,although I'm saddened it meant less games for  Welbeck or pushed him out wide.

<b>United were less pleasing to the eye with Van Persie up front.</b>

I find that odd because Van Persie was part of an Arsenal side who have  probably been the best footballing side in  the PL the past decade. I think the quality of United's football was already in decline by the time Van Persie came to United.

<b>That United would have still won  the league if  Fergie had invested in midfield instead of Van Persie.</b>

I find that  a pretty strange and  bold claim. For a start it should never be an either/or situation. It assumes if United had not got Van Persie, Fergie would have invested in midfield, an area I feel he had neglected for 3 or 4 years.


The last argument smacks of the kind of complacency and arrogance which led to the appointment of Moyes considering Van Persie's goals more or less won United the title by mid Feb, not withstanding he might have gone to City.

1532~~~
Bit of a useless performance. The defence will of course be that "he barely saw the ball" but that was because his hold-up play was awful. Looked completely out of it by the 50/60th minute.

1533~~~
I don't think anyone can blame RVP today. Thankless task today.

Awful midfield play in the first half meant service was few and far between. Smalling then screwed him over by taking his support away. After that he ran and worked but it was only going behind during a spell of 20 mins where city dominated and after his great turn and run that we showed spirit to push city back. By then his fate was sealed.

1534~~~
Too slow.

1535~~~
The ball was probably played into his feet with back to goal about three times. He played well enough.

1536~~~
Well enough isn't well enough, though, is it? If you're content with our striker not being able to keep the ball for us to move forward then fine, that was 'well enough.' He was too slow and too weak to every 50/50 and didn't show near enough in his hold-up.

1537~~~
I don't think he was that bad. Didn't really get much service and I thought he was decent on the ball when he had it. He looked very isolated at times but that's understandable considering we were down to ten men for most of the game.

1538~~~
Invisible again today. Was the 2nd worst player on the pitch apart from Di Maria. Did nothing.

1539~~~
We were down to ten men. How many times have you watched a game where the lone striker has stood out in those circumstances?

1540~~~
I thought his run and shot from a tight angle that Hart saved with his feet, was one of the few pieces of genuine skill from a United player all match. His header that set up Januzaj's shot early on was also good play. Overall this season I've not been impressed at all by RVP but today I thought he did well given the lack of service.

1541~~~
What else could he have done today? Did as much as he could given he's never been too pacy.

1542~~~
I didn't think he was too bad. Saying that, I would have preferred Rooney up top and Herrera in the midfield.

1543~~~
A great run and forced a save from Hart. Got the ball to Di Maria for our best chance. You should watch the game with your eyes open you'll spot a little more.

1544~~~
Well enough to win the game on his own? No. Well enough to not be criticised unduly? Yes.

1545~~~
It's more to prevent a free pass than undue criticism. External factors outside of his grasp were clearly of more significance, but he did not have a good game and a frequent fault in his game deserved to be picked up upon.

1546~~~
2 things in a whole game? That's just not good enough. Despite going down to 10 men he offered very little going forward or setting anything up from midfield.

1547~~~
And the header for Januzaj's chance. Who did more going forward? What do you expect from a player barely given the ball?

1548~~~
As a lone striker I don't think he covers enough ground, he wasn't terrible today and didn't get great service but I think he's the striker for when we are on the front foot, not when we need a shift.

1549~~~
Not sure what people expect of him knowing his role in a game like that. Sure, his hold up play could have been better, but the service was just non-existent in the first half.

1550~~~
Was incredibly poor in the beginning of the season. But he's been far better in recent two weeks. Today he did what he could. Especially with 10 v 11 there wasn't much he could do anymore but working his arse off - which he did.

1551~~~
Hold up play went back to being abysmal. He looks old.

1552~~~
Agree with this. Made the tight angle chance out of nothing and did well to get the ball to Di Maria after that run from Rooney. There was times in the game when he had the whole of the City back four against him on his own. What more could he have done given the circumstances?

1553~~~
Had poor service today mainly due to being a man down. On the other hand in that situation we need a high energy striker, Imo he should have been taken off and not Januzaj and put Rooney upfront. 

Would like to see Falcao upfront next game, that's if he's fit.

1554~~~
I'm hoping Falcao comes back soon and in good shape because I can't see how we can go much longer with RVP as the only striker.  There were more than enough times today when Rooney got to the edge of the box, saw no option for playing to RVP, and had to dish it out wide to the left.  He was way too stationary compared to the Chelsea match and I don't see any signs of him going back to the player who would get several good chances in each half.

1555~~~
He was only invisible because of the lack of service. Many times he had his hand raised, calling for the ball but did not get it.
It really would be nice to see Rooney even attempt to pass to RVP instead of his usual long ball out to the Right wing. At least falcao tries to link up with nice one-twos.

1556~~~
That's the problem. As soon as we went down to ten, he should have come off because he's useless as the lone striker in a team that's playing on the counter.

1557~~~
Another game to add to the "why the feck did we sell Welbeck" file. Wasn't actually a bad performance but he just doesn't have the legs for that role. Danny, on the other hand, would have been perfectly suited.

1558~~~
That's one way of looking at it but we weren't exactly playing on the counter were we? We just kept hoofing the ball up and in such situations I'd rather RVP up top than Wilson.

1559~~~
Did his job today, decent performance, was surprised to see him come off when we were chasing the game.

1560~~~
Didn't do badly today, but I'd like to see him holding up the ball a bit better for us.

1561~~~
Januzaj should have stayed on and Van Persie should have come off after Smalling was sent off. Rooney or Di Marie up top would have chased down all of those hoofed balls with a lot more purpose.

1562~~~
This

1563~~~
This. He wasn't this slow 2 years ago, but he just look so laboured these days. Feels like he's lost his sharpness.

1564~~~
I hope the golden boy gets a rest the next game.

1565~~~
If we had 11 men on the field i felt he would have scored a goal today. His movement was very sharp before the sending off but the midfield wasn't finding him.

1566~~~
He's never relied on pace but damn he looks so slow these days and in the second half of most games he's looked completely fooked, seems like he's got fitness problems to me.

1567~~~
I think last week's goal papered over the reality that he's in decline and will probably never return to his form of two years ago.

1568~~~
I don't think he was poor today he just didn't get any service because we spent most the game defending after the sending off.

1569~~~
Agreed. Rooney and Falcao up top with Wilson as a backup looks like the way forward. Taking into account our never-ending injury crisis, RvP would still get some playing time under his belt.

1570~~~
Sorry, what? How the hell is Wilson higher up the pecking order?

1571~~~
He looks like a player thats near retirement tbh. We've all seen them - Shearer comes to light.

He's looks shot with his diggin deep / head down, to run any length of yardage & he cant lead the line anymore. This is only a year & a few months, after he was shit hot with us too. 

Seems to have lost it very quickly, so i hope we're planning ahead for next Summer's striker recruitment drive, because RvP as a world class striker - his form days are gone from what i've seen..

1572~~~
Sadly, probably right. I do think he could be very useful as an impact sub, as his predatory skills are still sharp. It just seems to be asking too much to play him for 90 minutes every week (and asking for injury as well.)

1573~~~
Should have worded it better probably. Well, if its Wayne and Falcao up top, then I would certainly not mind to see Wilson get an odd 20 mins time in each game (basically Chicha-style). He looks the real deal. If one of Rooney/Falcao is injured then it would be RvP plus either of those two with Wilson as a sub. Wilson is the future with high potemtial, while RvP seems to be phasing out gradually.

1574~~~
Batistuta's last few years always spring to mind: fantastic first season with Roma, followed by a steady decline (if I remember it correctly.)

1575~~~
The lone striker role requires strength, dynamism and a lot of work, I just don't think it is in RvP's wheelhouse these days.

1576~~~
He couldnt hold the ball up at all - nor run like a player who was fit. Have you not noticed his new running style?

Head down & striving to get the legs goin!

1577~~~
Ahh, fair enough.

1578~~~
He looked spent to me, toiling up front on his own for over half the game. Just before he came off I even saw Demichelis outpace him. It was the right decision to substitute him.

1579~~~
Not so sure Batistuta looked after himself off the field though man. He always looked hungover or drunk.. Same as Mario Kempes too..

Guarantee ya - Kempes was Batistuta's role model <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1580~~~
Maybe we can get a job done on him, like this bloke had:

1581~~~
LVG's only mistake today was taking off RVP imo

1582~~~
Not a bad idea, Robo van Persie! That wasn't a bad remake of a classic from my youthful days either.

1583~~~
Yeah - he should have just put him down. I hear ya brother..

1584~~~
Robo Clog <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Big time man. I loved that awesome bike & the fact they incorporated his wife etc. into the story, unlike the original..

1585~~~
RVP played fine in the circumstances, I don't have any real complaints about his performance. The problem is I have a massive case of New Toy Syndrome, I'm just impatient to see Falcao lead our line. Fine as Van Persie has been, you can't shake the feeling a fit Falcao would have been better. The only cure for my condition is for RVP to be dropped and Falcao to get a couple of games up front. After that I'll be able to appreciate RVP if he gets his place back on merit.

1586~~~
Its unfair to judge him on today probably. In general though I think Falcao brings more to the table these days.

1587~~~
Would have dented his confidence after last week but I think he should have been taken off for the extra defender. We could have used Januaz's pace for counter attacks, which was the only way we looked like scoring and also added some protection to the fullbacks. My criticism of Van Gaal so far has been being overly lenient towards accommodating him in the side.

1588~~~
His severe lack of pace is frustrating. With 10 men you need a bit of luck and the ability to get something out of nothing. He is too slow to get onto any passes or anything though. Apart from that he was alright. Difficult circumstances so it's understandable. Definitely not the same player anymore though.

1589~~~
Do people criticize players for the sake of criticizing them? How people can watch RVP play and then have a go at his hold up play and strength is beyond me. That's the best part of his game.

1590~~~
Because they want Rooney there instead of him.

1591~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

It's got to do with Falcao. People want him to start games despite him doing nothing whatsoever that would merit a swap at this stage.

1592~~~
RvP never relied on pace. His hold up play is one of the best I've seen. It is so difficult to take the ball from him. Yesterday was one of those days when I saw him working extremely hard and running after the ball to help the team. There was that one moment of brilliance inside the box that could have resulted in a goal. Yes, we all want to see Rooney and Falcao play upfront but RvP is almost on par with those two and offers something else entirely. He doesn't get the service he deserves. Two years back he had a world class Valencia putting in deadly crosses from the byline and creating chances by the bucketload. Now our wingers are absolute shite. ADM isn't good as a winger for this team. Januzaj isn't playing well either. some of van Persie's runs are excellent but we don't have the perfect #10 to release him. Rooney doesn't have that incisive passing ability and Mata doesn't get much playing time on the field.

LvG needs to make a rigid formation with a system that suits the players. He can have two or three such formations and change it according to the opposition. If he wants to shoehorn every player into the team then it's gonna end up badly

1593~~~
Nope. Most think Rooney is best placed as a striker and not as a No10, thus they would like to see him replace RVP. LVG is not one of them.

1594~~~
I largely agree with all of that. He's producing the odd moment of real quality in every game, including yesterday in very difficult circumstances. He does look low on energy and mobility though, and its affecting his ability to make an impact when service is poor or limited. Its far from unreasonable to wonder whether Falcao would have been more consistently threatening if he was fit yesterday.

1595~~~
He wasn't great yesterday but I'm confused as to what more he could have done. He worked hard and held the ball up reasonably well when he received it. Do people expect him to just pick the ball up, beat the entire defence and score by himself when he has very little support? Also he did actually almost score with a great piece of skill.

1596~~~
Fair enough. I agree that the lack of pace and mobility is holding him back, I'd love to see Falcao and Rooney upfront for the next games

1597~~~
He had 18 touches yesterday and he created at least 3 chances.

1598~~~
His hold up play used to be phenomenal, but he was making Demichelis look a lot better than he is yesterday.

That aside, the major problem with Van Persie isn't his hold up play, strength or even work rate, he's just simply too laboured. We're all about pace and power, or at least that's what I think we're attempting to replicate, yet he just isn't giving the opposition centre half's enough to worry about. Wilson came on and worked the back line straight away, winning a few corners, corners we wouldn't have had with Robin up top.

Our attacking play, or lack of it, has actually gone unnoticed in recent weeks. Van Persie is part of this problem, a big part of it.

1599~~~
10 passes attempted in 90 minutes. That's a bit shit really. Obviously, being a man down made life really difficult for him but he wasn't much more involved against Chelsea (13 passes). Simply doesn't have the legs to play as a lone striker. Which is hurting us. What makes it even more frustrating to watch is that he has looked a tiny bit sharper in the last two games. Just not covering the ground we need him to.

1600~~~
Its a moot point after Falcao getting injured and Rooney coming back, but I'd have liked to have seen Falcao up front and RVP in behind in place of Mata. There's been flashes of a good understanding between those two (I'm thinking specifically of Falcao's knockdown for RVP's great shot that hit the post against West Brom) and I wonder if Van Persie wouldn't have benefitted from someone else doing the heavy lfting and leading the line while he looked for space slightly deeper. He wouldn't have been any more lightweight defensively than Mata either. Ah well, hopefully its Falcao and Rooney starting for the next few games as you say!

1601~~~
They're some pretty damning statistics. I really think he's looked quality in flashes in just about every game, but those stats are proof that he's just struggling to get on the ball at all.

1602~~~
Was awful for me yesterday. Looks so ***-interested and slow. Had maybe 1 or 2 good bits of play. But that was it, and thats too little in a game against a top side. Fair enough 10 men made it difficult but he was really poor.

1603~~~
A break would do him good.

1604~~~
He's not fit enough to play a lone striker role, it's a very demanding job. You need to combine some strength, technique and pace. RVP has only technique

1605~~~
Don't know what people expected with us playing with 10. Di Maria was the most guilty of wasteful play when we were in good positions on the break.

1606~~~
I don't want to turn this into one of those threads but we did have a striker who had those things...

1607~~~
His movement is terrible, it seems he's in some kind of energy saving mode when playing from the start, and bursts into life for short periods of time in the closing stages. At this point I think he is a big part of a problem. However, it can be solved easily.

1608~~~
To be fair, I don't think it's possible to discuss any of our strikers without turning it into "one of those threads". Why should we all ignore the elephant in the room?

1609~~~
I guess people feel as if the point has been made enough. The longer RvP struggles though, and the more games Falcao misses, the worse the Welbeck sale looks. I have no doubt he'll score against us in a few weeks.

1610~~~
Yeah, that's fair enough. Although it's impossible not to stew on what happened when you see RvP slowly trundling around up front on his own. Far too much is made of Welbeck not taking his chances, when you have a lone striker as dynamic as him it also creates space for others to share the goal-scoring burden. 

Which we saw whenever he played that role for us last season. We consistently looked much more threatening with him in the team than we do without him. Just so fecking frustrating that he has in abundance exactly what we lack up front at the moment. Pace, power and work-rate. Would have caused City (and Chelsea) so many more problems with him instead of RvP, irrespective of their chance conversion %'s (and it's not like RvP is taking all his chances anyway).

1611~~~
Showed his class, when he turned nicely and had a good shot saved. 

No pace there though, and it is making the Welbeck sale look a little questionable at this moment. I still think we should be looking for another striker, who is quick and powerful, something we lack at the moment.

1612~~~
Exactly - he is getting far too much criticism for his performance yesterday. Even with 11 men in the last few games he has looked very isolated on his own upfront, with 10 it is even more difficult for him in that kind of set up. 

Obviously he doesnt offer the kind of pace that we got from Welbeck - but that is not what he is there for, that should be coming from Adnan and Di Maria.

I hope we switch to a more attacking line up for the Palace game with 2 strikers - even if it has to be Rooney and RvP, who dont link up that well, then so be it.

1613~~~
He looks f*cking feeble at the moment - like an old man. I know Kompany is a unit, but RVP just bent over for him time and again yesterday.
He needs a break and I hope LVG can see it and gives him a week off and starts Wilson against Palace.

1614~~~
Or just puts Rooney in his best position maybe

1615~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It was definitely one of the better modern re-imaginings I've seen, the bike was badass.

1616~~~
Sweet Jesus some sense! I was beginning to think that this 'Rooney as a midfielder' madness that everyone is swallowing hook, line and sinker was something that only I could see!

We've got one of the best strikers in the PL playing in midfield with two really good midfielders sat on the bench...

1617~~~
The stick RVP is getting is ridiculous, the other players are hardly setting the world on fire are they?
He played well against Chelsea, all his efforts were on target. Had a thankless task against City, and created a half chance out of nothing which seemed to give us a bit of a lift. Holds the ball up better than any other striker we have and given chances I would still back him.

1618~~~
Lord Neville has absolved him of most criticisms.

1619~~~
I don't think he did. He admitted he's not playing well but also pointed out (correctly) that he's making all these clever runs and no-one is picking him out. He's never been particularly pacy and doesn't rely on it to score goals, he makes runs off the shoulder of the last defender and relies on service into that space in behind and he's not getting it. I'm not suggesting he's been amazing either but when you have a striker like RvP if you're not playing to his strengths then he's wasted.

I remember Fergie saying it took a good while for our players to get used to his runs when we signed him. I'd have thought LvG would know how to get the best out of him but he hasn't yet. Maybe Carrick coming back will be a blessing.

1620~~~

Up to approx 4:45 about RVP.

1621~~~
He never really got stellar service at this club even in his first season. Difference was his allround game. He needs to recapture his playmaking attributes because now he only seems to think about goals. I don't know if Van Gaal has instructed him not to come deep but it seems like has no real interest to create and playmake anymore.

Will we ever see this RvP again?
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WFPs3vHQOFg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1622~~~
the only player who isnt scared to play the killer ball is Herrera. Play him.

1623~~~
One of the two examples Gary pointed out was ridiculous unless he thinks Blind can pass like Scholes or Pirlo, and he mentioned Carrick but I'd love to see some stats on how many assists for RvP Carrick has had. The problem is that even if we did suddenly have Carrick rolling back the clock and picking RvP out, the hold up play and all around work running the channels in the loan striker role is not suited to RvP, even at his best for us he had a partner close to him who did all the other work in Rooney or Welbeck.

I'm not looking to just take a shot at RvP but if we are moving to a loan striker formation the same problems will keep happening because it's not a good role for him. When you look at top teams who play with one up top like Lewandowski at Bayern, Benzema at Real, Costa at Chelsea, the workrate, running and hold up play is vital in making it work, RvP is missing too many aspects required for the loan role at 31.

1624~~~
I definitely agree about the Di Maria part too, he has been useless for the past few games on the wings, it's easy for teams to nullify him, he needs to be inside more and I honestly think he is the player with that vision to play those balls to RvP, our players need to have confidence in him and as someone said Herrera as well needs to come back because he plays those balls through too.

1625~~~
Fenerbache have inquired apparently

1626~~~
That pretty much sums it up. I was screaming for Fellaini to slip the ball in to RVP in one of the situations shown there, but the guy clumsily held on to the ball for too long. It was terrible.

We need Herrera in the advanced midfielder role.

1627~~~
Fellaini and RvP were in the exact same position about 5 minutes prior to that chance, but van Persie managed to get himself offside when MF tried to release him. Fellaini hesitated on this occasion because he was afraid the same thing would happen again.

Fellaini isn't the hapless passer you're making him out to be.

1628~~~
I'm not buying this. So Fellaini decided against playing the correct pass because Van Persie was caught offside previously? Do we then decide not to be aiming for Fellaini's head in set pieces because he got beaten to the ball by a defender? 

Offsides are an occupational hazard for strikers, just like losing an aerial duel is for players. Van Persie didn't stop Drogba's goal when he was at the near post in the Chelsea game. Do we then decide against putting a man on the post at corners? Of course not.

1629~~~
Falcao would replace RVP wonderfully in that case. Nothing beats playing a striker on loan in the loan striker role.

In any case, I would much rather have Falcao than RVP playing alone up top. Falcao gives much more energy and he showed pretty good holding up play in the couple of games he started as well. RVP just look so lethargic these days, seems as though he ages twice faster than normal.

1630~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Ooops.

Yeah, I think if we can get Falcao a run in the <i>lone</i> striker role we'll start to see the benefits in our overall attacking play.

1631~~~
He's human. It happens with players all the time. The word most people use to describe it is confidence. Fellaini obviously had the ability to spot the pass, because he did exactly that only a few minutes earlier.

1632~~~
I thought City defended that first run of RvP's (as shown in the Neville clip) quite well. Kompany (I think it was Kompany) and Clichy were very close together and Fellaini was probably thinking his pass was going to be intercepted if he tried the pass so he probably thought not to. That being said, obviously he should sometimes take the risk.

1633~~~
He does not look the player that we bought. Don't know if he is in decline or is not comfortable with the system. Didn't look himself at the world cup either.

Carrick/Giggs brought out the best in him with the passes they picked from the deep. May be we'll see a resurgance now that Carrick is back.

1634~~~
I know. You're making it out as if I'm berating Fellaini for that mistake. I'm not. I just agreed with Neville's assessment that RVP is not getting the service he needs.

1635~~~
If di Maria would pass more to Shaw (or Rafael, depends were he is) it would be much harder to nullify him. He is just keeping the ball to much.

1636~~~
we should have kept Welbeck and let him go. If said that several times. Give Wilson a go until Falcao is fit again.

1637~~~
The day van Gaal came in, that was never going to happen. 
Plus wages.

If it was possible, I'd have done the same though. In fact, I probably wouldn't have bought him in the first place. Just seemed a signing done to stop him going to City, to flex our muscles, and to add a match winner that we actually didn't need. 

And it's a mini representation of how we've not been been making a proper effort to play a certain way for the last couple of years. Basically - win however.

1638~~~
I don't really agree with Nev's defence. The nature of being a striker is that you make dozens of runs in every game you play, hoping that maybe once or twice you might get the perfect pass to pick you out. You can't pick out three runs he's made over 90 minutes (one of which would have required an absolute worldy of a pass to pick out) as evidence that he's not getting the service his performance deserves. We had players in the team like Rooney, Januzaj and Di Maria who are well capable of spotting a run and delivering the perfect pass. If Van Persie was consistently making great runs over 90 minutes they would have definitely been able to provide the through balls Nev seems to think he's lacking.

1639~~~
There is no elephant in the room. Welbeck wouldn't have miraculously changed our fortunes. He's an average-good striker, and one who works best in a fully functioning team. Our team is so disjointed that Welbeck would have looked as ineffective as ever.

1640~~~
Disagree. There's far too many examples in the recent past of the presence of Welbeck making the difference between our team functioning well in an attacking sense or functioning poorly. As recently as this pre-season.

Even if you focus on his most basic of attributes you can see how having him up top would have improved us. Having someone with genuine pace would have made a massive difference on Sunday. With both City CBs able to comfortably out-sprint our lone striker if required their job was made far too easy.

1641~~~
To be fair that is all van Persie has been so far, if not below that level for most of the season.

1642~~~
Don't deny that, I'm saying Welbeck would not have made a difference. We'd be better of dropping Van Persie, moving Rooney up top, and fitting in Mata, Herrera, Di Maria, Blind and Carrick into the midfield. That would be formidable.

1643~~~
It would also be the narrowest midfield in the history of football!

Agree with sticking Rooney up top instead of RvP but would stick a proper midfield 5 behind him, with a bit of width. Obviously, would be even better to have Welbeck up top and Rooney just behind him, as Mata's been kind of crap all season. Plus Rooney's always linked up with Welbeck much better than he did with RvP.

1644~~~
Great analysis by Gary Neville, just highlights the fact we need a creative midfielder like a Pirlo/Alonso to feed our world class strikers.

Maybe we have them at our club now in Herrera and Mata, but Mata needs to start bucking his ideas up, he's better than what he's shown in his last few games.

1645~~~
Since he came to us and was so great during his first year, I always supported him, and last year he was awful in his performance but also scored 18 goals in 26 games, which is a very good ratio regarding his injuries. Last year I pointed what Neville said, wiht few support, passer, or good ball. 

But this year he has Di Maria, Rooney, Mata, Herrera around him, even Fellaini attracting the balls and he's still average in his game.

He's probably tired a bit, but I see this year more player in the box, the ball moving quicker. It's perhaps the fact that he feels not being the savior or the main man..

1646~~~
My feeling is that we are not going to see the RVP of two seasons ago. Sure he can score the odd great goal, but his overall contribution, energy, dynamic seems to have waned. I was one of those who felt not so bad about Welbect leaving, but I'm happy to eat my words about that. He would be incredibly useful at the moment.

1647~~~
It wasn't so long ago Van Persie did this:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gEOxLMIZ4s4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

I wouldn't give up on him just yet. He's not in his best form but he only needs one big game to lift him. Imagine he'd have finished off that run from the left hand touchline against City? Nobody would be questioning him. Fine margins.

1648~~~
At the end of the day, a striker's peak years are 26 - 30, and Van Persie's just turned 31. 

We got the tail end of his peak years and it was well worth it, I'll always maintain that, but to keep expecting him to reach that peak again is futile.

The frustrating thing is that used more sparingly he could still provide some class - why not <i>start Falcao</i> up top alone, give him his obligatory 60 minutes and then bring on RvP for the last half hour against a tired defence? Fresh RvP versus tired defence will help him to find form and confidence again.

1649~~~
Touble is, Falcao has yet to be fit...and there is a chance he's going to become a sick note...

1650~~~
Ibrahimovic is 33. Drogba is scoring and playing well at the highest level and he's 36. Neither of them have ever relied on pace an awful lot and neither did RVP. Maybe injuries got the better of him, but he still should have maintained at least a bit of the class we all know he's capable of, but it's a rare occurrence now, aside from the likes of the World Cup goal vs Spain or the hatrick in the CL last 16 last season.

1651~~~
Yes that is true....and Sheringham did it for a lot longer! Part of me thinks its psychological. Part of his hunger or whatever it is left with Fergie. I really think he thought Fergie would be at OT for at least three more seasons - perhaps it's just really knocked him more than we think. I expect him to say as much when he releases his autobiography!!

1652~~~
Not a problem, Rooney is one of the best strikers in the PL - just play him up top instead of starting him in midfield.

Both are past their peak though. And that was my point, not that RvP is useless and should retire, but that he's past his peak, which is true.

People seem to be expecting him to replicate the form of his peak, which he won't.

1653~~~
Would it be that? Under Moyes, yes. Under Van Gaal? The two are clearly close as we saw before the WC.

I think its simply a question of form. Strikers go through these periods. Its not like he's had a major goal drought. The team has been stuttering a bit, we've played two very tough games most recently. I wouldnt be surprised at all if Van Persie starts against Palace and gets a couple of goals and gets back into some decent form from there. 

He could be too old and past it, of course. Everyone is different, just because Sheringham or Drogba played into their late 30s doesnt mean Van Persie will. But there is no reason why he has to be finished at the highest level just because he is 31.

1654~~~
This thread... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1655~~~
He'll come good.

That analysis by Nev shows why. We were picking him out with those runs in SAF's last season. Moyes' season was a write off, and we've had an influx of new players, new system this season so, with all things, it'll just take time.

1656~~~
If a club came in for him in January - would you be happy to see him shipped out?
He hasn't done enough this season so far but I still think the quality is there.  Problem is that RVP needs to start scoring otherwise he will become a problem for LVG.

1657~~~
No chance. Falcao hasnt shown he can stay fit, Wilson hasnt proved himself at this level and Van Gaal doesnt seem to like Rooney as a striker. Losing Van Persie is the last thing we need.

1658~~~
Regarding the G Nev analysis I have been surprised by just how poor we are in terms of picking up runs from our forward players. These days there are so many times in a game that I can clearly see someone in a great position being ignored. Robin himself seems to always try to take the ball inside himself rather than look at a pass. I am hoping that with time players will develop  a better understanding but I have been surprised that there has been very little improvement in this area

1659~~~
If we're going to 'balance the squad' and change to a 4-3-3 I reckon we need to shift out two of RVP, Mata, Rooney and Falcao and bring in quality out wide and at the back. On current form you've got to say that neither Mata or RVP have made huge cases for themselves this season but Falcao is still a question mark injury-wise so its really too early to call.

1660~~~
We dont have midfielders capable of giving those passes, when was the last time we even scored from a through ball in the air? It fecking annoys me, our players seem to do it the hard way, cant remember the last time we scored a simple tap in from a cross/pass. Those simple goals like Mata his goals, or RVP vs Swansea, Herrera vs QPR, di Maria vs Everton, why arent we doing those easy things more. To become a force, I think we should get the basics right first.

1661~~~
Well to be fair RVP has actually missed about 5 one on ones this season, not classic ones but like the one he missed vs Chelsea. Those chances come through because of superb movement from RVP and then someone putting a perfect pass. Sadly Robin has hit the keeper on those all season

1662~~~
True, but even that is just too little, watched Arsenal last weekend, never spotted a bigger difference, it isnt coming from Sanchez only, also from Welbz, Cazorla, and the other midfielders. Only one making runs in our team is RVP, the only reason why he should stay, what'd happen if we left him out, poor crosses from Januzaj/di Maria all game. There is like no routine in our game so far, no threat, no penetration, it's all way too complicated. Just watched these highlights on TV, and I asked myself, why cant it go easy like this? <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.footytube.com/video/borussia-mgladbach-hoffenheim-nov02-312222?ref=lchan_vidgrid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.footytube.com/video/borussia-mgladbach-hoffenheim-nov02-312222?ref=lchan_vidgrid</a>

1663~~~
That Gary Neville video does highlight a problem, a long standing problem for us, we lack creativity centrally. Especially when we have Di Maria out wide, Herrera on the bench and Carrick in defence. 

Van Persie isn't at his best but its not solely to blame I don't think. When Falcao is fit I'd love to see him as our lone striker, while not the quickest his movement off the ball is fantastic. As long as our players find him, obviously.

Also, I'd love for Sky to have an option to watch the game with that camera view Neville is using to illustrate his points.

1664~~~
what's funny about it...

1665~~~
Can't really say Wilson has had a proper chance under Van Gaal yet. Yes, he's had a couple of sub appearances but overall, not a lot of game time

1666~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U6C4RUhlUE8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1667~~~

1668~~~
At least he is aware of his form then. Hopefully he can turn it around.

1669~~~
Love his comment at the end about Savage

1670~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1671~~~
Don't think that chance he fluffed was as easy as it looked, but he isn't striking it well lately (for the most part). What really bothers me is that he is so selfish at times it is actually scary. I don't know if he is getting criticism for not scoring and this makes him desperate to hog chances despite others around him being in better positions but it hurts the team.

1672~~~
The free pass continues.

1673~~~
The trouble with RvP is he will never again be as good as he was in his last year at Arse and his first year with us. Hope Van Gaal sees this and takes him off his automatic rubberstamp teamsheets.

1674~~~
When Falcao is fit, he needs to be dropped. Falcao provide much better movement and energy upfront. I am unsure whether he should be dropped for wilson at the moment.

1675~~~
He needs to be benched. Back up striker. Falcao and Rooney as first choice strikers.

1676~~~
His inclusion in our first team is annoying me now. I think it's hurting us a lot.

1677~~~
Should have done much better with that chance but this formation hurts him and Di Maria. The service to him is so poor at times, he's feeding off scraps and gets few chances so when he misses, it's magnified. But that said I would bench him when Falcao is fit.

1678~~~
Seriously, it's time to shove him into the Teddy Sheringham role. I'm begging for that, PLEASE!

1679~~~
You mean the bench?

1680~~~
He's incredibly frustrating, he slows us down so much and messes up some easy chances. Please get well soon Falcao!

1681~~~
The only thing he seems interested in is a getting a shot off. He slows everything down and is too selfish.

1682~~~
Bemused that Wilson came on for Di Maria and not RVP.

1683~~~
We could just play the same formation with Rooney up top and Mata/Herrera in behind. If dropping him was an option we are not short of choices really.

1684~~~
No, walking up the steps of the Sacré-Coeur in Paris on his knees. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Of course, I mean the bench; it's obvious that he has lost it now and can no longer play as a starter.

1685~~~
It's as if he knows he's playing so badly that the only way to prove himself is by getting a goal, to the detriment anyone else scoring because he's because so selfish whenever he's in the final third.

1686~~~
I think hes holding us back, needs to be dropped for good of team, he can come on as a sub, but with his recent performances, has to be benched

1687~~~
Snatched at everything today, seems more concerned with his own game than team play.

1688~~~
After a very good performance against Chelsea, he's gone back to being crap again.

So frustrating.

1689~~~
Those Carrick balls up to him tonight would be a dream if we had someone who did more with them.

1690~~~
Way too slow on the ball, that sequence where he kept on faking crosses was pathetic in its conclusion.

1691~~~
Service hasn't been great but he's not helping the case by being so stagnant in his movement. He's letting defenders stay close on him too easily, and it shows when we keep seeing defenders take the ball off him after his first touch.

1692~~~
That was quite a sad moment tbh. Horrible to watch.

1693~~~
Even his hold up play, which was perhaps his greatest strength, has deteriorated. Demichelis last week, and Delaney today, have both easily shrugged him off the ball. He made them look like a prime Vidic at times.

1694~~~
Di Maria has been far worse the last three games.

1695~~~
I've said all along, when Sir Alex left, he took with him 40% of RVP's ambitions....

1696~~~
True, it just feels like he's so isolated and gets crowded out. At times in the City game there was 30 or 40 yards between him and Rooney and most of the good work he did today was when he was dragged out of position to get the ball. He needs someone (Rooney or Falcao) making runs to occupy defenders and open up space.

1697~~~
More for the shape of the team. We ended up playing with Rooney on the left, Mata on the right and Van Persie as a No.10 who's sole aim seems to be to score himself. Wilson had to come deep to get the ball because neither Rooney or Van Persie were providing anything, because they should also be upfront.

1698~~~
The way he snatched at Mata's shot when it came off the post typified everything that's wrong with Van Persie right now. He's got no trust in himself. He's not taking chances he's grasping at them. Had he simply controlled the ball he could've stroked it into the corner of the net, which is something we've seen from him several times e.g. Wigan (A) 2012-13 when he scored the right foot curler from a much harder angle. Maybe he needs to see a sports psychologist? He seems to have got himself into the same state of mind as he was in at Euro 2012 when the pressure did for him.

1699~~~
He is not getting enough service thus when he does get an opportunity he tends to rush it or be selfish.
The interplay in the middle like between fellaini, DiM and mata suits his play better than a hard semi-low cross into the box that does not reach him.

1700~~~
With Carrick back into the team, he got a few balls into his feet today. Think he needs to hold it up better, though. Also needs runners in behind, as he looked to be a bit isolated, at times.

1701~~~
Hold up play has been fine but his finishing and goal threat is non existent.

1702~~~
he doesnt bring anything to our play doesnt make runs to be picked and unless he stars scoring I dont see why he shouldnt be on the bench or out of the squad.. if those chances were missed by welbeck the redcafe would have crashed down

1703~~~
great goal scored by Aguero today, Van Persie would never scored that goal as he is too slow and lazy and immobile to make runs like aguero. great feet as well..

1704~~~
Although there is a lot that RVP can do better right now, I don't think we're helping him much right now either. He's very isolated up front, and he's not getting the service a striker should be getting. RVP had maybe one chance today, and even that was a very tough chance because of the defender closing down hard (and blocking the shot). I think Gary Neville made this point too after we lost to City, and it's definitely true. We're not helping him enough right now.

1705~~~
He should be left out of the next game, maybe try Rooney up front against arsenal, maybe we have to start regarding him as more of a squad player than one of the first names on the team sheet.

1706~~~
Disappointing and lacking form but can we afford to drop him against the gooners? Have an inkling he will come back refreshed and in better form. You just know he has a goal in him when we play the gooners.

1707~~~
He's got a bit of a tradmark now, nice run out to the right, then take about 3 hours to cut back inside onto his left foot.... and do nothing with it.

1708~~~
The team needs a fit and firing Falcao to take our play to a higher level. It is like watching paint dry at the moment,  no pace or penetration up front.  Crystal palace had more pace than us, let alone competing with your Bayerns and Real's.

1709~~~
Sorry, but it's just never looked fluid for any length of time since he's arrived.

1710~~~
Taking tips from Valencia?

1711~~~
I'm surprised at some posters writing him off, poor run of form of late, but if we can get him back in the groove then surely he still has another season or two at the top.  it's not as if he has relied on pace his whole career, still has a fantastic footballing brain and superb technique, which helps as you get older.

1712~~~
Bit strange to be criticizing him when he's getting no service.

1713~~~
In the same way it would be strange to give him a free pass.

1714~~~
He is not ruthless as he used to be anymore.

And he is dissapearing in the 2nd half which is becoming a pattern.

1715~~~
Wouldn't give him a free pass, but the criticism is over the top. He only needs one chance to bury the ball and then we wouldn't be having these conversations.

1716~~~
He's had many of those chances over the course of the season, believe me.

1717~~~
I think we've gone beyond that cliche of an excuse now.

1718~~~
I've defended him all season and I think of much of the criticism has been ridiculous but he had a poor game today. Even his hold up play was gash today.

1719~~~
He has had service and chances even today tbf and he has messed most up this season. 

Plus since when did he become Chicharito level of reliant on others ?

1720~~~
I mean, his role is clearly to play up top as number nine, to remain in and around the box. Rooney's position allows him to see a lot more of the ball and thus he is more involved. I think it's a bit harsh that some are jumping on van Persie to be honest, if Adnan and Angel had better games today we probably wouldn't be having this conversation.

1721~~~
RvP in present form needs to be dropped. I'd play Rooney up front with Mata and Herrera and Di Maria behind, with Carrick and Blind as the holding players.

1722~~~
Can't believe how fast he's declined and van Gaal still wants to stick with him. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> If we can't get Falcao back to his old self, we've reached a point were we need to sign a world class striker. Someone who's on the same level as Diego Costa

1723~~~
I was thinking the same having seen how having a world class striker is making all the difference to City

1724~~~
Whats worrying is that LVG doesn't seem to rate Rooney as a striker. Leaving us atm with a underperforming Van Persie, injured/unfit Falcao, and a totally unproven player in Wilson.

1725~~~
Rooney is sometimes a bit inconsistent with his touches. Today he's had 3 great chances any top striker would've scored and he missed all 3, could have cost us the 3 points. Then he also has some games were anything he touches goes in the back of the net.

1726~~~
Yeah, that is true. But I'd still rather see Rooney up top right now then this current version of RVP.

1727~~~
Considering our so called world class attacking options, it seems a bit ridiculous to think that we need a new striker, but that's how I feel at the moment. We severely lack pace up front and a someone who stretches defences. None of RVP, Rooney or Falcao are giving us that.  RVP seems to be on the decline big time and there are serious question marks over Falcaos fitness. If this carries on, I wouldn't be opposed to Van Persie being shipped out in the summer, and the money ear marked for Falcao spent on somebody else, although it's hard to think who is a available.

1728~~~
Seeming more and more like a myth as the season progresses.

1729~~~
Isn't his contract up in the summer of 2016?  That would mean he's either due for an extension before next season starts or he's sold this summer if he doesn't perform.

1730~~~
At least he had the movement to get in that position something RVP is not doing with the necessary conviction and commitment. Never mind the chances RVP missed early on or the moves that broke down because he was either indecisive or too slow with the ball, goals change the complexion of matches and he has missed a number at critical stages. With a defense like ours we need our forwards to put games out of sight.

1731~~~
Spot on. RvP will not get any younger and looks on his last legs this season. I'd personally play Rooney up top. Hopefully, Falcao gets over his injuries and starts to perform. Still hope he makes it here. if he does not, than buying a new striker would not be a bad idea at all.

1732~~~
He's been poor for a while now, everyone else gets dropped in a second, but he seems immune at the moment.

1733~~~
He won't get dropped.

1734~~~
Bobbins van Persie

1735~~~
I think that is spot on, all the fuss is about how poor our defence is and although I agree we have huge problems up font as well, we don't have four world class players, RVP is on the slide, Rooney isn't player he was, falcao could be in decline as well and it's a struggle to see how mata fits in. 

We need a complete rebuild in that area, I would let at least two maybe even three go and add some more pace skill up front and some players who can offer us some more width.

1736~~~
Still can't get over the sale of Welbeck. In all probability requested a transfer. Instantly took away my excitement of buying Di Maria and Falcao.

1737~~~
.....Carrick Blind
Herrera Mata Di Maria
.........Rooney 

I'm sorry to say but RVP has left his best days behind him. LVG has to man up and play the above system (When they are fit) and play Rooney up top as as he is energetic enough to run and close down defenders.

Today Rvp looked lost upfront on his own though the whole attacking department did, but I'm basing dropping him not just for today but this whole season!

1738~~~
Does the way he's not pulling up any trees despite starting every league game for Arsenal not show you it wasn't that big an issue?

1739~~~
His style of play is exactly what we need. Wether or not he would have made it here is for another thread, but if I was looking for another striker in the summer, then it would be a more complete version of him. Pace, can beat a man, stretches defences. Everything that none of our current lot posses.

1740~~~
RVP has now played almost exactly the same number of mins that Hernandez got in the PL last season. Hernandez managed a miserable 4 goals and 2 assists in 853 mins. I'm struggling to find the words to describe a return of 3 goals and 0 assists in 10 PL matches.

We really should be taking an extended look at other options.

1741~~~
Robin van Worsie

1742~~~
Dare I say an injury during International duty may be a blessing in disguise for us.....

1743~~~
Dark...

I'm pretty interested to see how he would react to being used as an impact sub.

1744~~~
Last season at least RvP when he played still scored goals... This season he just doesn't even look like scoring. When he does get in a chance, he usually fecks up the finish as he has done almost every game this season so far.

1745~~~
There was a moment in the game today towards the end where he had the ball in the penalty area, unmarked team-mates steaming in on all sides and ready to receive a pass, and instead he dallied on it for a couple of seconds and then just aimlessly pelted it at the four Palace players standing in front of him.

1746~~~
I'm shocked how bad van persie as been this season .
I thought he would be flying under lvg but sadly he looks off the pace and slow .
He definately needs benching and wilson or falcao given a good run with wazza in the #10 role .
I'm keeping a close eye on the blind/carrick competition too ,and if it goes how I see it then maybe a dutch bias will creep into the club . that's how it looks with rvp keeping his position when everybody knows that he's a shadow of the player of 2 seasons ago .

1747~~~
this is precisely why I wanted us to sign Cavani. now I just hope that Falcao can stay fit because I don't see RvP regaining form from his first season.

1748~~~
-//-

His performances are basically pretty much the same. poor

1749~~~
RvP needs to be dropped blah blah blah, it's now the song everywhere. Our problem is not RVP, our problem is that our supposed creative players like Di Maria , Januzaj and Rooney are not creating ANYTHING. Do you people not watch football?

1750~~~
We were pretty poor in that regard during his first season too (zombie football in all its glory) yet he still managed to look far, far more dangerous than he does now.

1751~~~
He really is a bit of a problem these days...

1752~~~
I'd agree with that. Januzaj seems to have gone backwards unfortunately.

1753~~~
Robin really hasn't looked good. But I think the people basically stating that this is the end for him are going a bit over the top. He's very low on confidence, and I don't think playing up top on his own suits him, especially with how disjointed the play is behind him. I have full (misplaced?) faith though that he'll start banging them in again soon. Just needs a spark to get the confidence back I think.

1754~~~
That sounds pretty good actually.

1755~~~
I do think he has dropped down a level. His lack of form is exarcebating this drop in  output hence leading to calls of his demise.

1756~~~
Yeah, after Rooney passed it to him on the left. 
Was typical of what he does these days.

1757~~~
Lewandowski for me. 
I don't know what the club did or didn't do with regards to signing him, but he'd have been great. Had we signed him and Kagawa, we'd have been laughing - to this day.

1758~~~
Something just dawned on me...

How come with all of our formation experiments, and all of our players playing in different roles etc - no-one <i>ever</i> gets a chance up top except for RvP!?

I mean, we've had Rooney in CM, ADM way out wide, Falcao as a second striker, Carrick and Valencia in the back 4, Fellaini as a number 10, Fellaini as a CM...

But no-one <i>ever</i> gets a start as the pure 9 except for Van Persie. Even from his own point of view that can't be good, strikers need competition.

1759~~~
I think Falcao probably would have, if he had been fit over the last few games he'd probably start up top in at least one of them. 

Your points about Carrick and Valencia though, those were mainly forced on by injury rather than by choice of LVG.

1760~~~
Watching him 'sprint' is painful now. It's like he's stuck in treacle. All knees and no pace.

1761~~~
Something that may interest people talking about van Persie's goal scoring this season is that Lewandowski currently has 7 goals in 17 games for Bayern but only had 2 after 10. Van Persie has 3 in 10 at the moment.

Obviously that just some numbers and doesn't say anything about the overall performance and Lewandowski has 5 assists as well this season but it just shows you it can quickly turn around if van Persie has 3 or 4 good games in a row.

1762~~~
We created a lot of chances in that season, he's not setting the world on fire but the constant cry for him to be dropped is becoming silly now, who do we play there if he is dropped? Wilson might not be up to the mark yet, Mata hasn't been stellar, Falcao is injured. People just keep saying, drop him , drop him, have they really looked around and considered what the options are?

1763~~~
Rooney up top, Mata at #10.

1764~~~
I'm not a huge fan of him, but I agree - there's nobody to realistically drop him for now Falcao may not be fully fit, and because van Gaal doesn't want Rooney as a #9.

Next season, I'm not against buying a new striker. Though that's probably wishful thinking, as van Gaal probably plans for van Persie to be a mainstay for the next few years.

1765~~~
Why can't he still take our corners?
In his first season, we went from being impotent from them, to scoring and looking dangerous, when he took them.
Better free kicks than Di Maria too.
I'm sure a flood of assists would help him to up his strike rate too.

1766~~~
There was a breakaway v City when RVP appeared to be wading through mud.  And work-rate is poor for me, too,  and he's missed some chances.

Not having a good season.

1767~~~
We're not seeing peak RvP at the moment.

On the other hand, which one of our players is playing consistently well?

I still think that RvP will improve as/when the team as a whole do.

1768~~~
The Daily Star apparently think he's due to be offered a two year extension, but on reduced wages:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2014/11/09/manchester-united-to-offer-robin-van-persie-a-new-deal-but-there/page/1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2014...robin-van-persie-a-new-deal-but-there/page/1/</a>

1769~~~
We're not fashioning enough chances for him. We've got 'nice' possession, but it counts for nothing if we're just knocking it sideways around their box whilst they have 10 men camped in there.

1770~~~
I think we need to play more short passes around the top of the box. RVP is always looking for one-twos. The goal Mata scored came from that sort of play and the nice pass Rooney gave RVP in the second half also came from on top the box.
We need to centralize our play and our wingers and midfielders need to concentrate on feeding our strikers instead of constantly going for glory themselves.
It is rampant in a lot of teams. Strikers are there for a purpose. Their role is to score the goals yet in many teams you see players looking to score rather than feed them. I saw the Arsenal game earlier and was impressed with how wellbeck, after making a nice turn in the box, squared a ball to Sanchez for an easy goal. In our team a player in Wellbeck's position would have tried and scored.
Maybe its because no one feels secure of their place in the first team so they try to go for glory alone.

1771~~~
Not going to be many one-twos or give and goes with this formation. Van Persie isn't playing well but he's also taking flack for a system that doesn't work for him. Lets remember when we played the diamond he had what, two in three?

1772~~~
That would be so typical of us to do that.

1773~~~
Thank goodness it's the Daily Star.

1774~~~
What will annoy me is if he's played alongside Falcao when Falcao is fit again. Falcao needs to be up there on his own, doing his thing.

1775~~~
I think i'm the only person who thought he played quite well against Palace. Thought he looked much sharper. His touch was on point every time the ball was played into him, even when the passes were difficult to control. He dribbled well and made a few openings for himself and his hold up play was decent. I think he suffered from our safe passing game against Palace(no one willing to play the early pass to him just like against city). He played more like the RvP of 12/13 imo

1776~~~
QPR, Leicester, West Ham, Everton  - so 2 in 4.

I agree that 4-1-4-1 is less than ideal for RVP as he doesn't have the pace to get himself away from the opposing central defenders. Best he can really hope for is that they both leave him, assuming the other is marking him.

Not easy finding a system that does work for him though. With the diamond he and Falcao were asked to track opposing fullbacks when they came forward. It soon became clear that neither had the fitness to do so in the 2nd half of games.

The big problem RVP has is that the dominant player is now Di Maria, whose strengths and weaknesses are a terrible match for RVP at this stage of his career. The only solution I can think of would be use the diamond but limit RVP's playing time to the extent that he can actually perform the defensive side of the role.

1777~~~
I think he should be benched for the next match, but since it is Arsenal, he wont be I guess. He knows a few things about them and the way Wenger setup his team. Slightly off topic here but I think Fellaini is a very important player in this match. We need a little 'troublemaker' for this occasion.

1778~~~
He still has a very good first touch and is able to beat a man and get off a shot with either foot. So it is really quite simple. Look for him and give him the ball.

1779~~~
He hasn't really worked in any of the formations we've used so far this season though. The goals he's scored have been in spite of his performances, even when the team looked most cohesive he's looked like the odd one out. He really doesn't seem to connect with any of the players in the team and at this point I don't even know which system he'd benefit the most from. Besides, shaping the team to facilitate his strenghts could be a futile endevour considering the form he's in and the limitations to his game which are becoming more and more apparent. Also, you have to question wether a player who's showing such dependance is actually fit to be the star player of a team with Uniteds aspirations.

1780~~~
Would be a fantastic option from the bench. He can come up with a bit of magic and use his brilliant hold up play to help see out a game.

Rooney needs to play as striker and Herrera needs to be in midfield. Would love it if RVP could do the Olé role but won't happen.

1781~~~
Because Mata has been stellar, hasn't he?

1782~~~
He's been better than Rooney or van Persie so far this season.

Since from those three RVP seems to have the biggest drop in form then it seems rather logical to move Rooney to #9 and Mata behind him.

1783~~~
RVP seems to lost his magic suddenly, he still has good ball control but he needs to reduce his amount of unnecessary fouls and put the ball into the net. I still can't decide whether Januzaj or RVP is worse at the moment as both does not link up well during plays. What I want to see is Rooney up top with Mata and Herrera behind him. I think that is more effective than what we are playing now.

1784~~~
He just got ruled out for the Dutch squad tomorrow and was training alone (well, with Clasie, who was also ruled out). Another injury for the list then?

1785~~~
Not even true that

1786~~~
Great news!

<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1787~~~
I hope Falcao is really fit for Arsenal

1788~~~
I would never be pleased about any injury to a United player (never know when you might need them on the bench) so wasn't being entirely serious.

That said, if RvP and Falcao are both unavailable that means Rooney starts up top with Hererra presumably taking his place in midfield. It's hard not to be pleased about that.

1789~~~
Its not like he's missing chance after chance has he even had more than 5 shots on target in any one game he seems to spend the majority of our games like the rest of us as the ball is played around the half way line. Dont think I've seen a team play more back passes since they stopped keepers from being able to pick the ball up as we play at the moment.

1790~~~
How so? His general play was simply better, he didn't get himself sent off for three matches, one of which was highly important and even the statistics back up this claim. No idea what more he'd have to do.

1791~~~
My thought exactly. Sounds harsh, but I would not mind seeing that. 

Although the press conference/article mentions a hamstring problem, it does not seem to be too serious. But then again, why would you say that, our Coach has tied his fate to the next competitive match anyways.

1792~~~
Because I tend to disagree with that statement right there. He played well vs Chelsea, but so did RVP.
I don't think any of the 3 have been great, out of the 3 I would say Rooney has been the best of them.

1793~~~
In Rooney's absence Mata had 3 games to prove himself to LVG but he was in large very disappointing. He played reasonably well against Palace and scored a good goal so now, in most eyes, he is playing better than RVP and Rooney. Sorry but one game is not enough for me to come to that conclusion.
Mata did not and has not linked up enough with RVP and that should be his primary job.

1794~~~

1795~~~
That's one cheesy grin

1796~~~
He's definitely lost weight since Sir Alex's last season. 
It was clear anyway, but when he took his top off after the Chelsea goal, he looked really really slim.

1797~~~
As much as I would like to see Rooney up front Im even more eager to see Falcao there.

1798~~~
So is he injured or not?

1799~~~
He's ruled out just to get some rest for the important match against Latvia. Hiddink already announced that he will quit his job if <i>we </i>don't win against Latvia. A fit RVP will be a huge help to win that game.

1800~~~
Balls.

1801~~~
You want him to be injured? I think he's improving game after game. If he can stay fit for a while he may even reach/get close to his old level again.

1802~~~
I saw improvements in the Chelsea match, he looked a lot sharper than he ever had done all season and despite the constant misses, he found himself in very potent positions. However, the City and Palace game saw a real drop in quality again, he went back to a very sluggish, laboured approach to the games, often receiving the ball and taking far too long to release, or becoming very predictable with his outcome. I'm not sure if many would agree, but I personally believe he will never reach such levels, and is on the decline.

1803~~~
Clear difference in the games you mention is the type of service he recieved.

1804~~~
I remember an interview with him in his first year where he said that he gained more muscles here at the suggestion of the staff and that he was fitter than ever.

1805~~~
He probably managed to hold onto the ball for more than 10 seconds once in the Manchester City game. He can't simply rely on 'service', top class players do far more than that.

1806~~~
Many world class strikers in the PL over the last 20 years relied on service......for every Suarez there is a RVN or a Shearer!

1807~~~
Was van Persie ever that striker? I don't think so. It's not like he's evolving into that sort of striker, either. He's pretty wasteful at the best of times, he is (usually) just very good at creating as many chances as he can himself.

1808~~~
He nearly scored an amazing individual goal against City when he beat two men and nearly caught out Hart from a tight angle. Like Neville pointed out his movement was good, its just that none of our midfielders could spot his runs.

1809~~~
Neville's examples were shite. He was basically criticising Blind for not being Paul Scholes.

1810~~~
At his best he's probably the most least wasteful striker in the league what are you talking about he's brilliant efficient and his movement and distribution is completely clinical. This season is messing with your mind!

1811~~~
Nope, ask anybody here - his finishing is very sporadic, much like Suarez in that he'll miss a few chances you'd expect him to bury then hit you with a wonder volley.

1812~~~
When hes on form he doesn't really miss chances and scores all types of goals, yes including wonder volleys. I agree though he does go through spells of missing easy chances as do all strikers though. See Costa vs Sporting.
His form is slightly worrying at the moment though, but I do think its overplayed, I've watch a few games where hes made runs and none of the midfielders can pick him out, the only one this season that seems able to find him was Di Maria when he was playing centrally.

EDIT: In our title winning season and his last Arsenal season even last season his chance to conversion ratio was very high.

1813~~~
Yeah, definitely.
I'd have backed him to miss an easy chance over Rooney and Hernandez - even at his peak.
But then he always had/has this ability to score a goal nobody else could. 
He could smash a shot in from a tight angle when other strikers (even Aguero) would try to take a touch inside. 

I think it's down to his choice of technique. Sometimes lacing the ball when he should place it, and visa versa. It results in some poor misses, as well as some incredible goals.

1814~~~
Even in our title winning season he missed plenty of easy chances. He's always been like that. Generally he'd compensate those misses with brillaint finishes elsewhere but that hasn't happened this season.

1815~~~
I think this is based on last season. His chance conversion is better than Rooney:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.caughtoffside.com/2014/01/21/ranking-the-premier-leagues-top-10-deadliest-strikers-by-chance-conversion-rate-with-liverpool-duo-riding-high/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.caughtoffside.com/2014/0...nversion-rate-with-liverpool-duo-riding-high/</a>

1816~~~
He doesn't miss many chances at all when he's playing well.

Hasn't played well in a while though. Even in his superb first season at United, he did seem to go off the boil a bit as the season wore on. Hence those memorable missed chances in the CL. Hasn't really been close to his best ever since IMO.

1817~~~
He was talking about easy chances. You said he was the 'least wasteful' striker in the league.
Whereas I'd say he was more likely to miss an 'easy' chance than Rooney and Hernandez.

Off the top of my head:
He missed a sitter against us in the 2-1 at the Emirates.
He missed a sitter against Milan that season.

He missed an open goal versus Reading.
He missed a good chance versus Madrid.
I remember him rounding the keeper versus Everton (?) then hitting the post.

He missed a sitter versus Arsenal last season.
He missed an open goal versus Leverkeusen last season too.

It's not a criticism, and it's not that big a deal (except for in the Madrid and Milan cases) because he'll score those ridiculous volleys and first time shots from weird angles to compensate.

1818~~~
Not sure about last season. I've blanked it from memory. But in the title winning he missed plenty of 1v1's which you would expect him to score.

1819~~~
To add to that, missed a sitter against Sunderland at home. Also missed a 1v1 against Arsenal at home (we scored from the corner following that so no harm done).

1820~~~
I don't think I said that, that is clearly Aguero.

I did say when he is on form, he doesn't miss many chances. When he missed those chances against Madrid etc he hadn't score in a few games so not on form. I also went on to say all strikers miss chances, but he will usually score most of his chances over Rooney

1821~~~
I also think Rooney has a lot more 'pop shots' than van Persie, somewhat skewering the conversion data. I'd back Rooney over RvP in most one-on-ones, and being in the right place at the right time, but when it comes to shots from awkward angles or given to him on the edge of the box with very little time to think, it's RvP.

1822~~~
Yeah, sorry it wasn't you who said that.

Fair enough, though I'd disagree that he's more likely to score a good/'easy' chance over Rooney.
I think in a one-on-one, or after rounding the keeper, I'd back van Persie to smash it wide or over the bar (or just miss hit it) more times than Rooney.

That's not to say Rooney hasn't missed a few easy chances - just not as many.
However I would definitely agree that van Persie's more likely to score a half chance, or score when nobody else could.

1823~~~
Wilson deserves to play more than him

1824~~~
Why?

1825~~~
BBC saying he was rested last night against Mexico but Manutd.com saying he was injured.

1826~~~
Thought the way we set up against Palace was woeful in terms of getting the best out of RVP. He was isolated a lot of the time and when he did the ball in the final third Palace had just about 11 men behind the ball. Quite often I counted 8 Palace players in the box. It's always going to be hard for any striker in situations like that. 

IMO you can tell a lot about a player's form by his first touch and how he receives the ball. Does he look like he wants it? Is he ready to create something? Or is he caught flat footed? Definitely earlier on in the season I thought he didn't look like he was going to do anything with the ball and seemed to take a second or two too long with the ball. Thought he's looked a bit more confident and sharp in recent weeks. I think the goals will come. 

I'm confident he can score 15+ goals for us this season but being on the wrong side of thirty I think we've seen his best. Which is not to say he can't be an important player for us but I can't see him being top scorer in the league again. Might be wrong though.

1827~~~
I agree with that pretty much.

Van Persie has never scored goals for us by dribbling through the entire back line of team because he doesn't have the pace to, instead he isolates defenders one on one or uses his movement to make sure he's unmarked when given the ball. The way this happens is by other players around him occupying defenders and opening up the space for him to operate in, at the moment he looks surrounded as soon as it's played into him. Look at the goals he's scored just this season for example:

Leicester: Falcao turns the right back which forces their players over and crosses in for van Persie who is one on one with a defender, heads it past him.
West Ham: Falcao plays in van Persie after Herrera wins the ball as West Ham try to pass their way out of defence, one on one with a centre back, hits it across the keeper.
Chelsea: Van Persie is unmarked because their defenders are busy marking our players from the set piece, puts the ball in after the save from Fellaini.

1828~~~
Watch his first season's goals for us. The vast majority actually come from crosses. I was actually surprised. 
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0t_B4Ud-oFA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

He's getting none of that service anymore. He's not a player that creates his own chances really.

1829~~~
1 goal, 2 assists tonight (albeit one of the assists was all Robben). Played very well, looked much better dropping back to collect the ball rather than playing lone with his back to goal as he has recently for us. He's scored in 3 of our 4 games vs. Arsenal since he joined us and had the best chances in 0-0 match, so hopefully him and Rooney can do some damage against them.

1830~~~
A goal, 2 assists and no injuries?! Huzzah!!

1831~~~
Excuse me while I don't get excited against the mighty Latvia.

1832~~~
Your optimism is much appreciated!

1833~~~
I just can't. Even his goal was a simple header due to poor defending.

1834~~~
I suppose he still had to be in that position, right? Even simple goals count.

1835~~~
Bog standard for a CF.

1836~~~
He played well tonight as a number ten. He will be well up for the game against Arsenal.

1837~~~
Ok then...

1838~~~
Even though it's only Latvia I hope this does something for his confidence if he can't put in a great performance against arsenal then there's literally no hope for him.

1839~~~
I really enjoyed his performance tonight, I got excited by the way he set up his goal, or his first 45 minutes in general playing as a #10. Five or six passes with the outside of his left foot. Bergamp-esque performance first half, Robben had some moments of brilliance too. Particularly like the slowmotion where Robben is about to shoot, and you see RVP already smiling before the ball went in, he knew that ball was going in before looking.

Huntelaar is a very good striker, played #9 vs. Mexico last week and now vs. Latvia. Against Mexico, he struggled even more up front compared to RVP this season. Wasn't involved in the first half tonight, still scored because of great movement of him. Good for him he got two goals today because I like him, but his performances show how hard it is sometimes for a striker, isolated up top, always playing against two or three defenders.

Pressure was on, Holland was in the worst form ever, Hiddink was going to resign if it was a draw or loss. But now there is still a good chance to qualify for France 2016 after tonight. Luckily there are no more international breaks until March I think.

1840~~~
Sorry but they won 6-0. Latvia are shit. Means nothing.

1841~~~
Did you watch the game? More than the goal, his overall performance and touch were encouraging.

1842~~~
Yes I did and Robben was a class above as he was at the WC. If we had a player as good as him, we'd go far and RVP would benefit from a WC player like him.

1843~~~
What does that have to with Van Persie's performance? We all know Robben is exceptional and the better player.

1844~~~
His performance was massively benefited by Robben, without him he would of been just as shit as he's been this season.

1845~~~
Easy there.

1846~~~
Not really. Creative players are supposed to supply the strikers with chances and strikers are expected to finish them which he did. In the end he scored a goal which hasn't happened all that much this season so there's no need to be so negative.

1847~~~
Of course they are shit, but so are several PL teams, and yet he has failed scoring against them. Let's just hope that he has turned things around and start scoring.

1848~~~
He did ok, very hard to gauge against such a poor side as Latvia, I mean Huntelaar also looked good and Robben was easily the main man.

1849~~~
Even if Latvia are awful, anything to build his confidence. You'd think he'd be keen to do well against Arsenal though, so hopefully he'll put in a good performance.

1850~~~
Talk about hyperbole! Literally no hope if he has a bad game against his old team? Do you work for a tabloid?

1851~~~

1852~~~
Thats the point of the attacking midfielder

1853~~~
Incase you've not noticed RVP has been utter dross for <b>months </b>now (not a few weeks but <b>months</b>!!!) so if he can't put in a good performances against the team he used to play for that have given him so much hate and bitterness since he left then there <b>is</b> no hope for him and he is done.

1854~~~
Ludicrous comment. Absolutely ludicrous. He hasn't played well for a while - I wouldn't say dross to be honest, but he hasn't been his usual self. But to say there's no hope if he doesn't play well in his next game ... well, that's just a stupid comment.

1855~~~
If he's not up for Saturday I'm seriously concerned. This is the game where he needs to be in rhythm to the game and cause havoc among their make shift defence.

1856~~~
How old is RVP? 32? I am surprised that nobody seems to have foreseen a decline in his performances. For me it was foolish from LVG to get rid of Hernandez and Welbeck, and place all our eggs in the RVP/Falcao basket - both similar types of player who have question marks regarding injuries.

(Ignoring Rooney in this equation as it looks like LVG sees him as a #10 or even CM)

1857~~~
I guess it comes down to what you see in a player. Louis obviously saw a lot more in the likes of RVP & Falcao, despite injury concerns, compared to Welbeck. I'm on record as agreeing with his decision, I really don't think Welbeck is ever going to get to their level, which is the level of player we should be after. So stick with them for a few years ... while always looking to unearth a new gem. Maybe he really sees a lot in Wilson, just doesn't want to throw him in too early while results aren't great.

1858~~~
Thats the thing though - "stick with them for a few years" sounds great for a player in their prime, but for RVP? I have my doubts. As for Falcao he isnt even ours yet - personally until I see some game winning performances from him then I am yet to see why we want to be paying the £50 odd mil buyout clause for his loan..

Welbeck (and this is all I will say as I dont want to turn this into another Welbeck discussion) offered something different to our other strikers - pace and huge work rate, for that reason in my book we should have kept him. Having plan Bs and Cs is always nice.

1859~~~
Not long turned 31, 5 months older than Robben who's been in the form of his life recently and a whole 2 years younger than Ibrahimovic who's still scoring bucket loads for PSG. It's not an excuse, especially given van Persie isn't a player who relies on lightning pace to perform well. In his first season he went 10 games without scoring and still missed easy chances.

1860~~~
But the thing with Welbeck is that he didn't want to stay as second choice - or in this case fourth choice. And I still fail to see that he's a better player than any of them, thus he didn't justify inclusion ahead of them. At that point, you might as well send off a player who is unhappy.

Yes, I know what you mean about a player in their prime alright. And I don't expect him to get back to his prime, but it's not that long ago that he looked pretty darn good in the world cup. People have very, very short memories.

1861~~~
Hahaha You obviously don't watch our matches ever since fergie retired he has been beyond useless. All throughout Moyes short reign and so far this year. Nothing stupid or ludicrous about it. I would have liked to see welbeck stay and RVP binned. Better for the team and for the future. RVP will never get to his previous form and he's been on a downward spiral for ages.

1862~~~
So if he is shit on Saturday but then has a run of great form then all hope would still be lost?

1863~~~
I've watched every game as it happens. As <a class="username" data-user="20951, @acnumber9" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/20951/">@acnumber9</a> mentions in the next post - so he plays badly this weekend, then goes on a monster run of form, is all hope still lost? He wasn't as bad as people make out either last year, he didn't play a lot, but without looking up the stats, he still had more than a goal every other game (I might be slightly off on that, but that's from memory). Even on a downward spiral, as you call it, with a goal every other game last season, that's better than I think Welbeck will ever manage as a main striker. Obiously, I might be wrong on that, but that's my feeling, and obviously Louis' feeling too. 

Very interested to see how RVP finishes the season, but to say he's finished if he doesn't perform well this weekend, yes, ludicrous comment.

1864~~~
I am glad we didnt buy him.
Clearly LvG was thinking that Falcao may not ever return to his previous levels of performance, so wanted to "try before we buy".
Personally, I am 50-50 on Falcao, as to whether or not he will ever beat his injury problems.
I've seen many players end their careers due to injury and I hope it doesnt happen to Falcao.

As for RvP - he is a threat up front.
I saw an analysis video a few weeks ago. I think it was G.Neville who did the analysis. 
What he stated was that RvP is doing everything correctly. The problem is that his team-mates are not seeing his runs, where 2 years ago, they were.
In summary, he was blaming the supply, not RvP.

1865~~~
Gary Neville's analysis was absurd. He was blaming our players for not having the ability to pick up wonder-passes and basically not being Paul Scholes or Xavi.

1866~~~
They weren't wonder passes! Plenty of them were relatively simple through balls. Wasn't like he was asking them to play delicately lobbed through balls with the outside of their bad foot.

1867~~~
We played welbeck out of position quite a lot he never got a fair run as a striker, welbecks workrate and pace (something we are now seriously lacking) were huge parts of his game and it's something we are definitely missing 

RVP was always going to get special treatment from van gaal any other manager in any other team would've benched him by now for his ghost performances, currently I'd love to see Wilson get more game time ahead of RVP he definitely deserves it.

1868~~~
I know we played him out of position, my thinking however is that even playing regularly up front for Arsenal, he won't match RVPs tally from last year.

Why does Wilson deserve it? Are you seeing him day in, day out in training? I've seen this mentioned before by someone, that Wilson deserves it. I find it a curious statement to be honest. I don't think Wilson has done a lot in his performances. Admittedly, they've only been cameos, but he hasn't looked particularly threatening, and also hasn't done a whole pile to get involved with the build up play. That is not to say that I don't think he has the makings of a great player etc, I just really haven't seen a lot from him to say he deserves it.

1869~~~
Based on what?

1870~~~
Yeah! Thank God, it's not just me who's wondering that.

1871~~~
Absolute nonsense.

1872~~~
After 45 minutes Holland were 3-0 up and the game was over. First 45 minutes RVP was the best player on the pitch, not Robben. Although they were both playing very well.

If you combine it with the fact he also had a very good match against Chelsea, the strongest team in the league, I think it does mean something.

It was a bit over the top, but I agreed with him to some extent.

In Holland there's a big group of (ajax loving) people who always seem to feel RVP hasn't played a good match, no matter how much he scores for Holland. They feel it's obvious Huntelaar should play instead of Van Persie, because RVP is the "problem" if we don't win. Very comparable to the people who feel Falcao and or Wilson should start ahead of RVP, because they think he has been a "problem" for us this season and we would've done better with somebody else playing up front.

Huntelaar got his chance last week and struggled for the full 90 minutes playing as a #9 vs. Mexico. Holland lost, without RVP even playing. Huntelaar was also invisible in the first half vs. Latvia, only notable moment was scoring the 3-0 in the 45th minute after a nice cross. He's one of the best rated strikers in the Bundesliga, has the experience and yet he was definitely not better for Holland playing the #9 than RVP has been this season playing #9.

Point being: it's way too easy to put the blame on a striker who gets isolated because the rest of the team is not playing well enough. Especially not when that player looks like he's trying, works hard and shows glimpses of genius almost every match, which I think is the case for Van Persie. Apparently some people doubt that, maybe they should watch back some of our matches this season without the matchday emotion.

What Gary Neville says is pretty simple: the moment a team plays better, a striker can benefit more. Valid I think, but sometimes it's even simpeler. Van Persie scored against Chelsea when Wilson had come on. Week before against WBA he hit the inside of the post after Falcao had come on. His other two goals were assisted by Falcao. His best match for Holland this season, he was playing with a strike partner in the name of Huntelaar. The moment we add even more quality up front, RVP becomes his old dangerous self, but we seem to lack balance in that sort off set-up.

Put Ramos, Pepe, Kroos and Modric at CD/CM and we would be up there with Madrid, I guess that's what frustrating me a bit, up front we're actually fine, that's not where the problem is. Got some talented full backs and in-depth quality too. The attacking players are really not the problem, all of them have showed some good and bad moments, played good and poor matches, all scored and assisted. And like I said with two world class defenders and two world class central midfielders, we would be easily up there with Bayern and Real in terms of quality.

But because we lack that quality in our squad and have had some poor results, RVP gets randomly blamed. First he was never going to get to full fitness, then his movement (probably his best quality) was deemed to be poor. Then he wasn't interested anymore and already past it. While in reality, looking back matches and leaving emotion out of it, he is doing quite alright. Sure he could have done better in some matches, but that also goes for Di Maria, Rooney, Mata, and every other fecking player in our squad. Players are not robots, and overall I still don't really see what RVP has done in particular to deserve the slack he's getting.

1873~~~
He wasn't very good against Chelsea. Didn't provide enough movement or energy up front, didn't give the Chelsea back line many problems, and was basically too quiet until the last-gasp winner.

If Falcao's fit, it's a no-brainer for me that we should be starting him and Rooney and giving RVP a rest.

1874~~~
Van Persie against Chelsea was the best performance we've seen from a striker all season.

1875~~~
Did you watch his performance vs. Latvia? Apart from Robben (who is outstanding at the moment) he was the best player on the pitch I thought.

1876~~~
Because he is basically the only striker we've seen.

1877~~~
You mean like after five minutes when he moved out brilliantly to the left? Adnan passed that ball 0.30 seconds too late so there wasn't a shot on target, but Chelsea looked clueless because of his movement.

You probably don't even remember that moment in the first half where RVP either made a hands ball or a chest control at the half way line. He ran al the way to the box, where Adnan passed it to him after which he had a good diagonal shot. That moment is the perfect example. Our number nine having to set-up his own attack from the halfway line was our way to get dangerous. How is RVP to blame for being isolated because our team lacks the quality to dominate against Chelsea?

He was easily our best attacking player and our main goal threat that match, scored an important goal against a great side. That performance wasn't different in terms of quality than his performances against big teams like Real Madrid or Chelsea when he was still considered 'very good'. The difference is that he's playing in a side that's not in good form and has less quality, yet somehow people convinced themselves it's the other way around.

1878~~~
He was excellent against Chelsea. And he didn't score the winner.

1879~~~
Just to clarify, from, one of our strikers not strikers in general right? Because in truth no one would have to play that well up top to register our best striker performance of the season so far.

1880~~~
Obviously you don't watch any of our youth teams have you seen his performances and record playing for them he deserves a "promotion" to the first team to further himself and get better.

1881~~~
Comolli says players over 30 are useless. Flog him.

1882~~~
He has had a promotion to the first team squad, to train with them, week in, week out. Thus, Louis can then evaluate how he does against the real men, not the youths. He hasn't deemed that he deserves a start.

1883~~~
Getting a promotion to the senior squad is one thing, definitely deserving to start over Robin Van Persie is quite another.

1884~~~
<b>Manchester United ready to sell Robin van Persie</b>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-ready-to-sell-robin-van-persie-9873729.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/foo...d-ready-to-sell-robin-van-persie-9873729.html</a>

1885~~~
I would only pay attention to such rumors if RVP was shunned on the bench to begin with. Otherwise, this is just making no sense. Anyway, nothing makes sense with RVP these days.

1886~~~

1887~~~
What's all this about a £10M loyalty bonus then and selling him before we have to pay it?  Sounds like a massive amount, worth an extra £50K/wk over his 4 year contract.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2275456-manchester-united-transfer-news-robin-van-persie-sale-eyed-gerard-pique-warned?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/...bin-van-persie-sale-eyed-gerard-pique-warned?</a>

Note the stat that he has performed better than Welbeck, despite everyone saying he is shit and Welbeck is the best.

1888~~~
Not necessarily sure the stat shows he's better? More games and involved directly in less goals than welbeck. Also note welbeck would take time to adjust to new surroundings, team mates, tactics etc. And this is from someone who thinks selling welbeck was absolutely the right decision and someone who thinks rvp will come good again.

1889~~~
Most disappointing thing other than the lack of goals has been his close control appears to have completely deserted him. He seems to be taking two touches too many on each occasion and eventually loses the ball on a majority of those. That just cannot happen, particularly in the final 3rd of the pitch. 

Once he got converted to be a center forward, he's always been the kind of player that played the quick lay off and made a killer run into space for the return ball. Now its just too much dallying, trying to provide an assist and thereby slowing down the play or allowing the defense to recover and set up a wall.

1890~~~
Heskey-esque controls.

1891~~~
Is he playing? not heard his name and I'm watching it <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

Another dire performance so far. Might aswell be playing with 10 men

1892~~~
Be nice if he decided to turn up at some point today.

1893~~~
If he carries on playing this shit we should sell him to Chelsea for £50m.

1894~~~
Haha but haven't they got that Costa fella, heard he's quite good <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1895~~~
Should have been sold in the summer. I said so at the time and most felt that miracle worker LVG would transform him.

1896~~~
True. The service he has been getting has been perfect.

1897~~~
Would be nice to see him not walk around for a start.

1898~~~
You can't always blame service, he's been crap for ages.

1899~~~
He's been just loitering today.

Wilson would be more suited to the counter attacking stuff we are doing today.

1900~~~
Needs to be dropped. I've had enough of him.

1901~~~
Has been terrible today. But not all blame can go to him because I cant remember the last time we actually put in a decent cross for him to get on.

Its just not his game to pick up the ball from 50 yards out and beat 3 defenders.

He needs service to be effective and we aren't getting that from this shithouse formation which the players clearly don't understand or can execute properly.

1902~~~
You all need to quit with these shit excuses. For 18 months now he's looked disinterested and like he's no longer up to it physically. The guy can barely move, LVG is daft for not seeing this.

1903~~~
Sadly we cant even drop him for Falcao.

If LVG was actually brave (and not biased) it would be Mata behind Rooney.

1904~~~
I believe he will be very useful once we decide to use him in the last 20 minutes or so. Definitely should not be a starter.

1905~~~
I want to continue defending him, and believe he will come good, but it's looking more and more like he really is past it as a top level striker. Often slows our attack down to a worrying extent.

1906~~~
Please drop him, there has to be a limit. Would really wish him and Welbeck had swapped teams.

1907~~~
Whilst he was poor today, and has been of late, we weren't actually even in the game in the first half. I think he'd be much better in a side that is playing better. That said, I wouldn't mind seeing Wilson given a chance from the start.

We needed to work hard today and RVP doesn't have the energy for it, unfortunately. None of our attacking players exactly shined going forward. These type of games he really does get shown up.

1908~~~
He really is finished. Off the bench, he'd be better.

1909~~~
There's something physically wrong with him.

He seems like hybrid of Berbatov and Anderson these days.

1910~~~
He was a pedestrian again. If Mata was dropped for failing to offer enough defensive quality, then RVP deserves the same treatment.

1911~~~
When he went off our counters started working much better actually.

Infact Rooney and Di maria were linking well to begin with while he was loitering or slowing them down.

1912~~~
the injuries last season killed him, first he got injured in the CL after coming back against Newcastle, then he got another injury late against Olympiacos. He has lost all the pace he once had too.

1913~~~
He's finished. Now the hard part for Van Gaal to find a creative way to make a permanent change.

1914~~~
Same again next week, Robin.

1915~~~
Tbf to RVP he did do well in one counter when he turned I think it was Monreal and had the ball but Di Maria couldn't keep himself onside. That's about all he did, though.

1916~~~
Anyone got the stats for number of touches he had today, number of passes etc?

1917~~~
Genuinely pointless. It was no surprise we were getting loads of good counter attacks once he came off, he just slows things down way too much for us.

Wilson did better in the 15 or so minutes he was on and that's saying something.

1918~~~
Its got to the point where its just impossible to defend the obvious, he's finished.

1919~~~
The fact that LvG subbed him off for Wilson is encouraging. A top world class striker will definitely be on the radar next year.

1920~~~
He has lost so much pace and his awareness of space has somehow kinda gone. It's so strange.

1921~~~
A last minute goal against Chelsea is all well and good, but it doesn't make up for the hours of suckage he's delivered this season. Our worst first team player this season by a huge distance.

1922~~~
His complete lack of running and effort is just horrible to watch. Even when we're breaking forward he's just strolling.

He's turned into Berbatov.

1923~~~
Whoscored is showing he made 3 passes and 3 crosses.

Wilson made 10 passes.

Wilson pretty much matched him for all the defensive stats and dribbles etc.. too in 15+9 minutes.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/829577/LiveStatistics/England-Premier-League-2014-2015-Arsenal-Manchester-United" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.whoscored.com/Matches/82...er-League-2014-2015-Arsenal-Manchester-United</a>

1924~~~
Forgot he was playing.

1925~~~
He holds the ball for far too long, slowing us down, offers little movement, no pace, no energy. He doesn’t contribute in deeper areas either so really, what’s the point? Wilson was much better and he can run with the ball pretty fast so for me he should start over Robin.

1926~~~
Rubbish. Not enough service but that doesn't excuse his touch, movement and general play. He was just gash. 

Well out of form and this has to end. Drop him.

1927~~~
I wouldn't wish injury on anyone, but injury would be the only thing to keep him out of the team now. He's been awful week after week, and he plays nearly the whole game every time.

He's keeping Wilson out of the side. Or we could go one up top and bring Mata or Herrera back in. Either way, we have better options who he is obstructing.

I hope Falcao kills it in training and ousts him out. I just can't see any positives to his game right now.

1928~~~
The best would be to give him a rest for a longer time, he was rushed back I think for the World Cup and has not had a proper break since, maybe that would do him good though I fear injuries + his age are the problems here and we have seen the best of him.

1929~~~
needs dropping, and fast.

1930~~~
Our worst player this season.

Berbatov was slow and turgid, not lazy and uncaring. He still slotted them in like crazy and his touch was orgasmic. He won the golden boot while given 50% the chance and playing time any other player was given. I'd take van Persie playing even slower than Berba if it meant the same conversion rate.

People miss the fact that a striker has to SCORE. Not "work hard" or "run fast". He has to be able to put the bloody ball in the bloody net. Same people who think work rate is more important than conversion rate are the same people who'd take Welbeck over Falcao.

And RvP isn't.

1931~~~
van Persie to retain his place after a stellar performance. Philosophy.

1932~~~
To be fair to RVP he is being asked to drop to the sides and do a lot of running when we haven't got the ball. Then when we do get it we are counter attacking its not really playing to his strengths! Much the same as Mata imo. Put him in the City team and he would be scoring for fun.

1933~~~
The only player who did absolutely f*ck all today. Very disappointing once again. He needs dropping for a few games to rest and get his head back in the game. I've been saying this for about 4/5 games now.

1934~~~
I wonder how poor he has to actually play to get dropped.

1935~~~
Had a good game vs. Latvia, but was poor today. Still don't think the service to him has been all that, but should be benched.

1936~~~
I know LvG is proud of his big balls, but trying to qualify for the CL while playing only 10 men is verging on over cockiness.

1937~~~
Probably would've scored some of Welbeck's chances too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Exactly like I've been saying last week, RVP is the end station. When we create feck all, he suffers the most. Was unlucky not to score too, obviously people have forgotten about Rooney being flagged offside for no reason, but that looked like a 100% RVP goal and then he would've been the hero.

His strike partner Di Maria didn't really have a better game, he had an easy assist, ran around a lot and fecked up the rest. I can see why people get annoyed with RVP and I'm not saying he's in brilliant form. Obviously a fit Falcao should be considered if RVP doesn't start scoring. But I think people are pretty unfair in their judgement.

Not that I really care today, because man what a great win, we finally had some things going for us for a change tonight. Wenger might be even more unlucky than David Moyes, such an incredible feeling  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1938~~~
RvP would hardly be scoring for fun at any team in the world. He's been put clean through a number of times this season and missed them all.

1939~~~
Would rather have Herrera in there to help us control games or Mata for added creativity because we are effectively starting the match one player shot. Needs to slapped out of his slumber with a long spell on the bench.

1940~~~
Wilson contributed more in the short time he was on than RVP did all game. Just awful. Incapable of pressing the Arsenal defenders or holding the ball up. Needs dropped fast.

1941~~~
Definitely yes and some of these chances, you'd have expect a player of his level to score them. Also since his movement is as terrible as it gets, it's not easy to create chances for him.

1942~~~
Worst he has played in a United shirt, we desperately needed him to hold the ball a bit upfront but he did nothing

1943~~~
He should've been off at halftime and I thought after Arsenal began coming forward the game was crying out for Mata and his playmaking abilities.  I guess it could've been even worse if he was allowed to stay on for the full 90 but there is nothing he's done to justify him getting into the lineup week after week.  Wasted a perfectly good opportunity to set up Di Maria, too.

1944~~~
God he was shit.

We should try playing Herrera as a no. 10 and Rooney upfront on his own. 

Think it'll give us a lot more balance in midfield and upfront.

1945~~~
No surprises at all. Not remotely surprised by his performance. Not surprised he stayed on so long despite being so anonymous. He did head clear a few corners; that's his primary function in the team at the moment. 

It's so far beyond a joke now that I'm struggling to know what to say.

1946~~~
We've got two games in three days from next Saturday.

I reckon he'll play against Hull but can't see him fitness-wise starting against Stoke on the Tuesday.

1947~~~
Waste of a shirt at the moment.

1948~~~
Not really happening for Robin at the moment. Just seems a bit off the pace.

1949~~~
I'm a massive supporter of RvP.
But after seeing him today. For most of the game I didnt realise he was on the pitch.
While he was on the pitch it was like playing with 10 men.
I think its time to get Mata or Wilson a chance.

1950~~~
He looks shot and, after 18 months, it's no longer a quiet spell. I'd try to get him off the payroll in January if possible.

1951~~~
What annoys me the most is that it's my boy Mata suffering from RVP starting.

If he starts against Hull at home, Giggs should have a real word with van Gaal.

1952~~~
hey...he's finished..has been ever since Fergie left...

1953~~~
Would be better as an impact sub at the moment.

1954~~~
absolute shite, apology of a performance

Wilson In !!!

1955~~~
Not going to get any verbal beating from me as it's LvG picking him when he's clearly well off it, but unless something drastic happens it seems like his time is up.

Still worth every penny though for what he did in Fergie's last year, just sad it's over so soon.

1956~~~
I think the game just didnt pan out in a way that would suit him. We were absolutely awful going forward in the first half so it didnt matter if he made good runs or not, none of his teammates were able to pass a ball into him

In the 2nd half we had more success but Arsenal were throwing so many players forward that it was clear you could get success with counter attacks. RVP doesnt have the legs anymore for counterattacking from inside his own half, so that didnt suit him either.

What suits RVP is when we have good passers, finding time on the ball and able to pick out his good runs

1957~~~
One of the worst performance in a United shirt. He looks devoid of confidence and is really sluggish. When he attempted to run at players, he was falling over and losing the ball. Needs to improve or we should give Wilson a go.

1958~~~
Redcafe logic: our defense and midfield were not able to outplay Arsenal and create a chance. So let's blame a forward player for not getting involved.

Our first shot on target was Rooney´s goal ffs: ,,With the Gunners forced to chase as a result, Manchester United grabbed their second goal on the <b>break five minutes from time as<span style="color: #000000"> Wayne Rooney </span>converted United's first shot on target."</b>

We literally created feck all, zero, until Arsenal got so desperate that they starting pushing without thinking and left huge spaces at the back.

Our most attacking players were Rooney, Di Maria and RVP. All three world class players. None of them even got a shot on goal before the 85th minute.

He was as invisible as when we lost away to Olympiakos, where the pattern was the same, we got outplayed and RVP doesn't get involved. I just don't see how he should be blamed for that. Which doesn't mean he couldn't have done more, players can always do more.

1959~~~
Please just drop him. Just for one game at least.

1960~~~
Not true, we had a decent amount of chances but just kept missing the target. Di maria had a shot in the first half, Smalling had the glorious chance from a corner that he completely mis-hit his shot, Di Maria's shot at the end was also off target. It's not really a telling stat as a lot, or the vast majority of Arsenal's shots were from outside the box and not really threatening. It's not like we parked the bus and didn't even look to get forward. Apart from the first 30 minutes which was awful, we broke forward well and in numbers, just took the wrong option now and then but you can't blame that for RvP not getting involved. Wilson had 5 more touches in his 15/20 minutes that he played then Van Persie had in the entire game until he got subbed (18 for Wilson, 13 for RvP). RvP was just non existant today.

1961~~~
Utter shit today, his worst performance of the season by far and that's saying something given how invisible the majority have been

Given the goal scoring form Rooney is in at the moment he needs to be playing as our furthest forward and get Mata in as the no 10

1962~~~
Exactly. Rooney should be playing up top, where he's clearly at his best (IMO.) Throw Mata in behind him, and we're sorted.

1963~~~
DROP. HIM.

I mean, we've all been saying it for three or four matches now, and the performances are only getting worse. Surely even Dutch solidarity must have limits.

1964~~~
Agree, Mata should start ahead of him.

1965~~~
Time for him to get dropped.

1966~~~
He's awful at the moment. Drop his sorry a$$ and start Juan in midfield and put Rooney up front where he belongs.

1967~~~
12 touches today, 3 of which were corners.

1968~~~
Just saw on MOTD that he had 12 touches all game, that's beyond poor.

1969~~~
Passenger. Drop him already.

1970~~~
I think being hauled off is an indicator of things to come.

1971~~~
Wow just seen the MotD analysis, 12 touches of the ball today and 3 of those was the corners he took. Absolutely dreadful these days, I haven't got a clue what's happened to him. In a game of this size he's had 9 outfield touches of the ball, that really is mind boggling.

1972~~~
He looked very sluggish again today. I hope this is just a lack of confidence and not the fact he's past it.

1973~~~
2 were clearing headers at corners. 1 was the kick-off. 2 were inaccurate passes.

1974~~~
Herrera or Mata in with Rooney up top. RVP can be a very good option coming off the bench. Having fresh legs against a tiring defence will allow him to better show his technical brilliance.

1975~~~
It must surely be a physical thing? Its like his body just won't do what he wants it too, very Torres-like. 

Thats the only the explanation I can think of, I mean, its not like he's just woken up one day and lost all his footballing ability.

1976~~~
He was a liability today and has been for a while.

1977~~~
LVG is not pleased.

May be just another super sub striker in United if things will go this way for a bit more.

1978~~~
Why, what did he say?

1979~~~
Amen. Hes playing on reputation alone right now and Wilson looks good enough so he's old enough right?

Two of the things we were promised when Van Gaal came in. 

So far Van Gaal is happy to throw young defenders in at the deep end but seems more reserved about attackers, it took a while to bring Januzaj into the fold. 

Maybe I'm drawing too much from it but combined with his transfers in the summer it says to me that Van Gaal's philosophy is very much based around his attacking players which is why he trusts established, experienced, players who maybe learn the thinking side of it a bit quicker. 

Means nothing if their legs have gone though.

1980~~~
Agreed, as I said previously, Wilson did more in the 20 minutes he was on than RVP did in the entire game. It’s never good when you can’t remember a single thing a player did during a game.

1981~~~
Not being pleased despite the win over Arsenal.

Clear indication that something was fundamentally wrong with some of the players especially in the 1st half.

1982~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> feck's sake.

1983~~~
He was pretty poor today but i just dont think he has the pace to play out on the right which is what it looks like he was asked to do. Given our other options its the best we had

1984~~~
He was a complete waste of space, easily our worst player out there. He barely broke into a run, he's barely broke into a run all season. He has to be benched now surely? Wilson looked so much better when he came on.

1985~~~
He must be doing amazing in training because at the end of each game, I always assume he will be dropped for the next game. To be fair I did expect him to play against Arsenal as it was his old team

1986~~~
If today doesn’t show him that RVP needs dropped then nothing will, Wilson deserves his chance, if not him hopefully Falcao will be fit enough for the Hull game.

1987~~~
The thing that summed up his performance was when he held up the ball and Arteta completely bullied him off it.

Mikael fecking Arteta. He is hardly a "hard" man but he won it back with such ease and VP was powerless to stop him.

1988~~~
I think he's finished, honestly.  He had those two good games against Spain and Australia in the World Cup and has gone downhill since then.

I'm hoping it's a nagging injury that he can get rid of but looking at his injury history I'm not optimistic.

What really looks concerning is that he isn't doing much in any area of the game now.  If he wasn't getting enough service in past seasons, he would try to involve himself in other parts of the buildup.  He doesn't seem to be doing even that very much.  Still contributes a bit defensively but he's being paid to score goals.

1989~~~
I think we can slowly bet on preparing Wilson for a bigger journey with this club. Fergie would take that result with a smile... LVG was confident about himself being not satisfied at all.

1990~~~
This is exactly what I mean. Wilson came on fresh in a completely different situation, where Arsenal are 0-1 down and looked shaky opposed to them looking very good until the goal. So he comes on, has a couple of touches and then? How is that comparable to RVP's situation, I just don't see it?

Using the same logic, I could just as easily say Wilson didn't add anything in terms of being a goal threat either. Yet when he came on there was a lot more space than RVP had, so it should've been easier for Wilson.

A much more fair comparison is Di Maria vs. RVP. Both played as a striker today, both didn't get a shot on target the first 70 minutes or so, how is that not a telling stat? Di Maria only got a shot on goal and an assist after Arsenal were 0-1 down and it was a completely different game. First 70 minutes in a comparable situation, I feel Di Maria wasn't much more dangerous or better than RVP.

I do obviously agree with you that RVP was non-existent today. But if you look at the tactics, Di Maria played the Robben role, with the freedom to roam around more, coming into the ball. RVP was the highest man up the pitch in putting pressure on two central defenders, making his trademark diagonal runs. Both playing upfront the way that best suits their style.

Still don't see how it's RVP's fault that Arsenal were outplaying us until our lucky goal and got desperate after that. And I don't see how it is RVP's fault our midfield and defense didn't reach him. They did try to hoof a couple of balls to him I guess. But Di Maria also struggled until very late when Arsenal were already losing it, showing it wasn't easy playing up front. I already mentioned that with a little luck, RVP would've scored 2-0 after that brilliant Di Maria pass to Rooney who was flagged offside.

Aside from that I guess I can see where you are coming from, it's fair to expect more of Robin van Persie, I just don't think his situation is that bad and I don't feel he needs to be dropped per se. A fit Falcao is a brilliant option, but he seemed to click very good with RVP, so why not take a defender (Blackett/McNair) out and play with both RVP and Falcao up top as soon as that's possible?

1991~~~
I think he's finished as a top striker. He can still be useful in some matches though, and be a good option off the bench. However we can't afford to carry him anymore. It's sad but that is the way it has to be.

1992~~~
His move out wider today kinda shows LVG is not blind, his poor performances have not gone unnoticed and the next step will be to give Wilson or Janzaj his place for a game or two. Also Rooney scores his goals in bunches so it would be wise to let him play upfront for the next couple of matches.

Strangely there appears to be a reluctancy to pass him the ball, the interplay between Rooney and RVP was highlighted last season, and his lack of touches/passes between team mates this season is unusual to say the least.

1993~~~
Never was a better time to drop him and nobody would question it. We have the players to replace him and do a better job, so do it. I dont expect it though, LvG and his favourism towards RvP are there to see. I bet if he was a spaniard, he would already be on the bench.

1994~~~
Feels like an inevitable sharp decline at this point. there's no way he looks like he can get back to scoring 20/25+ goals a season unfortunatly.

1995~~~
We lost 1 in the last 7 games with him playing up top, how the hell are we 'carrying him' and why can't we 'afford' that?

Err... We played a 3-5-2, meaning no wingers to chase down fullbacks. That's why he had to move out wide sometimes. The reason we played 3-5-2 was not because of RVP, but because we needed defensive balance.

I must admit this is true, RVP is playing because he is Dutch. It's got nothing to do with Rooney being a better #10 for us at the moment than Mata, and Wilson being 19 having played 5 official games for United, Falcao injured...

He looked excellent 6 days ago against Latvia, apparently that doesn't count because they were shite. Rooney being great against Scotland, who were pretty shite too does seem to count on here. If RVP scores 17 goals in the upcoming 26 league fixtures he's scoring 20 this season. Doesn't really seem that impossible to me? 50-50 for him to score at least 20 this season would be my guess.

1996~~~
Fitting him into the team right now makes no sense at all. We are literally creating formations that are specifically designed to have van Persie in them and it's not right when he has clearly not been good enough for a while. Chelsea goal aside he has not had a good moment this season at all from what I recall. Wilson would probably have more of an impact than him but the best solution would be to move Rooney up top with Mata supporting him.

1997~~~
Poor today but not surprising really considering how we set up to play, it wasn't the right game for m, should either have played Wilson or Herrera or moved Rooney up front. He will start the next game though because I don't see LVG dropping him and he should hVe more service.

1998~~~
It has to do with Rooney being the better striker and Herrera or Mata taking the number 10 spot and just offering more you know. At least we wouldnt play with 10 men.

1999~~~
We are carrying him because his form is poor and he is slowing our attacks down considerably yet he continues to play. Yes we only lost one but I would be confident in saying we would have performed better without him in the team. We can't afford it because we are going to drop points in matches as a result of his lack of effort, poor defensive workrate, iffy finishing.

2000~~~
He looks so tired all the time. At one point he got the ball on the half way line and had the chance to run free into their half, but you could tell he just didn't have any gas left in the tank. Instead he passed to ADM who was off-side.

2001~~~
I agree with this, hope to be proved wrong.

2002~~~
Agree, funnily enough I said same things you have to a friend as we were watching the match

2003~~~
Waste of a shirt. The only thing keeping him out the side is injury.

2004~~~
Good thing he wasn't made captain

2005~~~
Does sort of look like Rooney and Di Maria seem a bit hesitant in giving him the ball at times. Wouldn't blame them, he just looks so laboured and poor to react, especially in counter-attacks.

2006~~~
I've defended him a lot this season, but today was just completely awful. We were basically playing with 10 men for most of it, that's how uninvolved and passive he was. I thought he would have been fired up to play against his former team at the Emirates, but it made no difference. It's about time that we drop him from the starting 11, and play Mata or Wilson ahead of him (until Falcao gets fit).

2007~~~
Eh?

The same DiMaria that constantly look dangerous on the counter?  the same DiMaria who set up one and should have scored another? The same DiMaria who's pace alone cause the Arse to play deeper?

RVP needs to be dropped... there's not really much else to say

2008~~~
Top #9's in the modern game don't rely purely on service, Ibra, Aguero, Costa and Falcao bust their ass to create chances for themselves, RvP is a passenger at this point.

2009~~~
Last season I felt sorry for him because he left Arsenal to join United under the impression that Ferguson was staying for a couple more years and he ended up being stuck with David Moyes. This season, feck him. Zero effort and doesn't look like he gives two shits. He could have been afforded some leeway if he was at least trying, but we are pretty much playing with 10 men when he's on the pitch. Wilson contributed more within 2 minutes of coming on than Van Persie did for 70 minutes.

2010~~~
It's time to bench RvP, either for Falcao or Eilson, whoever is fit and ready.

2011~~~
Yes let's make RVP a scapegoat, fans really are a fickle bunch.

2012~~~
He played today? Shit.. I didn't see him <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

2013~~~
I wouldn't say he is being made a real scapegoat. Not really blaming him for too much, just saying how poor he has been and how much better we can do with what we currently have.

2014~~~
A scapegoat for what? We won the game. He played shite.

2015~~~
How is anyone making him a scapegoat? He's been poor and deserves to be dropped so people are pointing that out. Not like w're blaming him for everything that's wrong with the team....

2016~~~
He's shit at the moment and needs to be.dropped.

2017~~~
Go on, call it a "kneejerk" too.

2018~~~
Bench him.

2019~~~
Wilson showed more fight and energy in his cameo than RVP all game.

He needs to be given a start.

Maybe Di Maria and Rooney on either side of him.

2020~~~
Not having that at all. He is not being scapegoated. We are simply recognizing the poor form that he is in.

2021~~~
There was a freekick in the first half by Di Maria from the right. Fellaini was roaming near the far post unmarked and I noticed he was in a good area to knock the ball back across goal. Next thing I see, RVP motioned Fellaini to switch with him in the crowd. Outcome? Ball ended up in Szczesny's hands near the far post with barely a challenge from RVP. "Why is he there if he is not going to bother?" is all I can think about.

2022~~~
He's more or less finished imo. I hope he proves me wrong, but at his age its unlikely.

2023~~~
Noticed that too. Didn't make much sense to me. Would rather have Fellaini come floating across near the back post than RvP.

2024~~~
I really think he need 2 weeks break away from football. And come back to the squad re energized. Him on current form is of no use to us.

2025~~~
I think he will come good against mid table teams like hull.I expect him to start scoring again.

2026~~~
He was given a break at the start of the season too. LvG even said something like "he's never been fitter".

2027~~~
His stats and performances are very similar to last season, where he was unhappy under Moyes. He has no excuses now with LvG here. 
I don't get how he is constantly starting but we have no idea how well he does in training. A fit Falcao will hopefully see him benched. 
If he stays this poor all season it will be interesting to see how LvG will react should a team come asking about him.
When does his contract run out?

2028~~~
Nothing to be a scapegoat for. He's been shit all season pretty much. A few decent performances without looking like much of a threat, but today he had like 12 touches in ~75 minutes, and 3 of those were corners, one being the kick off. So 8 touches in open play. That's awful.

2029~~~
He's 31 I believe,, that's not -that- old, though i can see where you're coming from, Sherringham for example who lacked similar pace but made up for it with clever movement (sort of similar to RvP's style of game, mental awareness > raw pace/power) came back to have his best season at the age of 33-34 so I think that type of player can last longer than say.. a Walcott type at 31+ but I think with RvP it's just his body failing him more than anything, he was always fragile throughout his career.

2030~~~
Have to say there was very little he could have done against Arsenal given how we played. We didn't create any clear chances for him as there was almost no build up play in an area that he could seriously influence from us. A somewhat frustrating and thankless display littered with the same what if's from the previous games...

What if we played him in with the final ball on the 3 or 4 times he was a spare man unmarked on attacks. It's clearly a tactical ploy for him to be on the edge of play waiting for the final pass.

What if we hadn't played him at all and had chosen a midfielder or Wilson instead.

What if he wont recover that blistering spell he started his United career with ever again.

All in all, no change in the RVP debate yet but he cannot be blamed for that solely on the Arsenal game. The opportunity wasn't ever really there for him to change it. The pressure continue to mounts though...

2031~~~
Just to put something straight, he's not playing badly because "he's not trying". This was an accusation levelled against him when Moyes was manager. LVG [his best mate] is now manager and he's gotten worse. He's in bad form or at a stretch, in decline. And for every managers, when your top players play like this, there's 2 ways to handle it, either play them into form [most managers go this route, believe it or not] or drop. He's not getting picked simply because he's best mate with LVG or that shit that is now being bandied about. As long as the player is showing commitment in training, he will continue to play atleast for a certain time.

2032~~~
When a player is playing as badly as he is it's impossible to see how he can make it back. He's good enough to adapt his game to compensation, but all his power and agility seems to have deserted him. He looks like he's running through sand while those around him are on grass. he look like he needs a long holiday, but we're only 3 months into the season.

2033~~~
Hopefully Falcao comes back in the next couple of games and RVP is dropped to the bench so he has something to prove. He has been a little drained of service recently but he should be doing better.

2034~~~
Really poor last night, is he done being a top player?

2035~~~
Typical he in injury free in his poorest season with us.

2036~~~
In pomp he was a stunning player and yes, the peformance against Chelsea was the best by a United striker this season, but in general he looks a shadow of the player he used to be. He was never quick, but he wasn't slow to things. He looks a little behind the play consistently, and his whole game seems to be worn out. 

I think it's time to start Falcao or rooney uptop defending on whether the latter is fit. Our focal point being so off color is a problem.

2037~~~
Play him into form in the reserves then. He has been pisspoor since DM took over. Nani would be benched after one poor game. Rvp isn´t benched after 1 and a half season. Really amazes me

2038~~~
His athleticism seems to have completely gone. He was never quick before, but he had great strength and could move the ball in ways which made him hard to tackle.

There was 1 point where he was through on goal with monreal chasing, and instead of trying to make him tackle, he just stopped and turned backwards <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

I am sorry but that just isn't good enough. He's playing on reputation right now, and I think he's had enough time to play into fitness.

2039~~~
Next week we have two games. Saturday vs Hull and Tuesday vs Stoke.  I think he is for sure dropped for one of those two matches, I hope the replacement can show what we are missing and RVP will get dropped until the Christmas period if he doesn't get back to form.

2040~~~
He clearly hasn't impressed much of late, but I do find it a bit hard to judge given that he is doing as little wrong as he is right. Yesterday, he didn't have enough ball to do anything. It is Van Gaal's job to work out how much of that is Persie's fault and how much is the rest of the team's. 

The fact is, he is out furthest forward player. To slag him for not influencing a game in which we struggled to get out of our own half for large parts seems odd. If our team managed to dominate possession, he would have been a lot more involved,  and then actually have an opportunity to play badly.  Yesterday, he was irrelevant, but I think that's different to playing badly.

In any case, I'd like to see Falcao in for him as soon as he's ready.

2041~~~
His most marked deterioration in him being pushed off the ball so easily and a slight loss of pace too. Not good signs, what's clear though is that he's being kept in for his poacher abilities and perhaps van Gaal's belief that he needs game to turn it around. But he's not giving us anything at the moment. A break would do him well, Rooney and Wilson/Mata upfront for me.

2042~~~
The loss of pace can be understood as he's old and it's normal but losing the ball so easily ? Controlling it so badly ? Something is wrong with him. I have been really disappointed by him.

2043~~~
I did say on this forum months ago that I was worried Van Gaal might prove to be a little too loyal to RVP. (Of course I was immediately told to stop talking shite and trust the manager to make the correct calls etc.) I'm not at all surprised that RVP has remained in the starting XI regardless of his poor form because he and Louis are best buddies. It was always gonna take a lot for the manager to drop him. This was always going to be bad news for Falcao, because of course you can't really put Rooney, him and RVP in the same team.
The thing is, dropping RVP doesn't mean you have to play Wilson (Louis may not want to throw him in just yet) or wait for Falcao to return from injury. He could bring in Mata, Herrera or Januzaj and let Rooney play up top.
Right now I just can't see an argument for RVP being in the side (especially when Falcao comes back). A break from the team will probably do him good and hopefully give him the motivation to come back stronger.

2044~~~
We have to remember how poor we was before we got the first goal, we couldn't string 2 passes together, not much van Persie can do. 
The service was non existent, on the caf some posters forget that RVP's game is not to pick up the ball and dribble past players at pace. His game is all about his movement and technique. 
Wilson came on and did ok, he ran around a bit. But to say RVP should be dropped for him is bizzare. RVP has a lot to offer this team we need to start playing to his strengths.  
Fans are fickle, a couple of months ago everyone was saying Rooney is finished as a number 9. Now everyone has turned on van Persie.

2045~~~
My argument would be that I think RVP needs a break from the side. He doesn't look sharp and the games seem to be passing him by right now.

2046~~~
I really feel it's also psycological. It's as though once he had that League winners medal....then Fergie left....all that ambition, drive, determination just drained out of him. He just doesn't look like he is bothered to win.

2047~~~
RvP's all round play has been questionable since he got injured against QPR 2 seasons ago, but at least he was scoring regularly. 

Now he's only scored 3 goals in 11 games, as well as not being great on the ball- it's only natural that people are going to question what he's actually offering to the team. The fact someone can play so badly so consistently for United under Van Gaal and still be an automatic selection is worrying.

2048~~~
It's difficult to see exactly what he's bringing to the team right now. He is completely devoid of pace, doesn't have a particularly strong work-rate and his finishing seems to have dropped off - he misses quite a number of decent chances. 

Perhaps it's down to the system and other players not playing to his strengths, as well. Last night the team was clearly set up to play on the counter, which effectively made RvP, with his lack of mobility/pace, useless. Unless the ball is played into his feet, he really is a passenger.

2049~~~
If a strikers has so little of the ball as he had yesterday, there's a much bigger problem than the form of this striker. A world class striker on top form wastes more posession than he got yesterday.

2050~~~
At the moment he offers absolutely nothing, and the only reason he's in the team is that he's pals with van Gaal. There isn't any sound argument for playing him at the moment.

2051~~~
Certainly seems like it. He looks sluggish and slow and even his fantastic hold up play seems gone.

2052~~~
He can't just palm responsibility off as being the striker who isn't involved. A lot of the game a striker has to do is hold the ball up, he just didn't offer that at all, with Monreal, Mertesacker and Arteta seemingly always in control. All three of which are fairly average players. Fine, if he isn't doing that, he has to be making runs, as some sort of focal point. But he just isn't doing that. He looks so lazy, so lethargic, he needs to be dropped.

2053~~~
I love van Persie, but he's been dreadful lately. I'd rather see Wilson start ahead of him for the next two matches - I'd be interested to see what he can do in 90 minutes.

2054~~~
I think he is automatic selection just because funnily we don't have other options. Wilson is good but not ready to start in the most important game so far. Rooney showed why he must play in number 10 role. For me RvP coming of in the last matches is a sign that LvG think he is not good enough atm.

When Falcao come back i am confident that he will replace RvP in the first team.

2055~~~
That's seriously shocking.

2056~~~
Its getting to a point where its like playing with 10 men. People try and defend him by saying hes getting no service but hes offer virtually nothing to give service to. Whenever he make a run it like watching him run through quicksand.
His hold up play is still there but he loses out a lot more than he used to.

If Falcao did have his injury problems i would say get rid of him in Jan and promote Wilson further.
Maybe even swap him and recall Hernandez, and hope real pay us a decent amount in the summer.

2057~~~
This is exactly what I mean when I say RVP is being judged very unfairly.

I guess some people on here are too thick to realise how good of a team Chelsea is, and how difficult it is to play well against them. It's not Rafa Benitez' Chelsea anymore, they are literally up there with Bayern, Barca and Real in terms of quality. Last season they beat every top team in the league and made it to the semi-finals of the Champions League. They've added Fabregas, Costa and Courtois to that and are completely dominating the best league in the world at the moment.

Compare this Chelsea team to Mourinho's Real Madrid we faced in the CL two seasons ago. Ronaldo is the only player of that team who would be a guaranteed starter at Chelsea's team at the moment. Costa or Benzema? Fabregas or Xabi? Oscar or Ozil? Hazard or Di Maria? Matic or Khedira? Ivanovic or Arbeloa? Terry or Ramos? Pepe or Cahill? Azpilicueta or Marcelo? Courtois or Casillas? Chelsea literally haven't got any weak spots in their team and they were in great form when we faced them.

Robin van Persie was easily our best attacking player and our main goal threat vs. Chelsea. Yet people on here feel 'he didn't add anything just got a lucky last minute goal'. So here are the highlight of RVP vs Chelsea, for the people with goldfish brains:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOSVd8za8Fc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

How can a player who is capable of putting in a performance like that against one of the best teams in the world <b>just 4 weeks ago!!!!! </b>be past it? I don't get it, I really don't understand how the brain of some of the people on here works. Especially when RVP played an excellent match 6 fecking days ago against Latvia. But that didn't count because they were shite. Rooney vs. Scotland who are shite too did get credits, showing how random the criticism is.

Sure RVP could always do more and the high expectations are justified. But us getting dominated by Arsenal is the reason RVP wasn't involved. None of our forwards got a shot on goal until the fecking 85th minutes. No combinations. The moment you use RVP in the right way and the rest of the team plays well, like for example against Chelsea, you can see how good he still is. He is not past it at all.

2058~~~
Could mean a few things though:
1. He didn't find spaces
2. Marked out off the match
3. Lost some pace
4. No one wanted to pass to him

2059~~~
The best strikers do a lot of their best work off the ball. 12 touches for a striker is not unusual. If 3 of them end up in the back of the net, then no one discusses it.

2060~~~
Yesterday was a bit hard to judge again for me. 

He didn't bust a gut but the service just wasn't there for him. I find it difficult to criticise him when that's the case. 

Did think Wilson's acceleration made us look a tad more dangerous though.

2061~~~
Until he finds some form, let's keep him on the bench as an impact sub.

Was well below par yesterday, and sadly I think we've seen the best of him in Fergie's final season. Wilson deserves the promotion.

2062~~~
You're trying a wee bit too hard. His performance against Chelsea was still a 7/10. I guarantee if he hadn't scored that lucky late goal, nobody would even be talking about it.

2063~~~
if we had conceeded Wilson would have replaced him.

RVP is not fast enough. But when we have our full team. I would always have him alongside Rooney or Falcao.

2064~~~
He is quite simply not good enough as a lone striker anymore. He needs a partner up front if we are to get the best out of him.

2065~~~
The hold up play is the shocking aspect, the way he was brushed off the ball so easily by Arteta yesterday was really surprising.

2066~~~
He had Di Maria kind of up front with him yesterday and still looked poor.

2067~~~
I've been trying to defend him all season but he's become a bit shite lately. He needs a Schmeichel-esque break from football. 31 is not too old and certainly not for someone who's never relied on his apce.

2068~~~
We shouldn't use him as a deep striker anymore. Falcao or Rooney up top, with RvP around him. I think he would greatly benefit from that, if not I'm afraid its game over.

2069~~~
In his defense, he didn't really get much service yesterday. His best chance was probably on Di Maria's long run where Rooney couldn't get the ball over to him. Would've almost certainly been a goal for RvP.

2070~~~
No, 12 strikers for a starter is very rare. It means they weren't in the game at all. Especially as 1 was from kick off, and 3 taking corners. Think he usually gets like 20-30 touches, which still you'd like him to get on the ball more. Welbeck for arsenal had around 40 I think. Hell, wilson had 18 touches in the 15-20 minutes he played.

2071~~~
RvP is someone you just can't carry in these big games/high intensity away games because he's going to offer no threat and no work rate and it's not even like his finishing is good enough to make it worth keeping him in the starting XI. He couldn't beat Arteta for pace, was getting brushed aside by the same guy, had no pace to run at Per and Monreal in a 2v2 situation and just had zero involvement in the game. His only contributions these days are clearing headers at corners.

2072~~~
got himself off the pitch remarkably quickly when subbed!!
couldn't wait to get off.

2073~~~
Stats always look amazing post game.

When you think someone getting 100s of thousands of pounds a week only touches the ball a mere handful of times in a game, it's a real joke.

2074~~~
I obviously dissagree, he rarely lost the ball and showed brilliant movement against one of the best and most organised teams in the world. And how was his goal lucky? If anything he looked like scoring during that whole match and was unlucky not to score two, just like you can see in the highlights.

Made a Real Madrid vs. Chelsea comparison because I remember people on here talking how good he was vs. Madrid two seasons ago, when he didn't even score once in two legs, didn't really got more involved either.

7/10 for that Chelsea performance pffff, he was not playing with Xavi, Iniesta and the rest of Barca in their prime, benefitting from insanely talented teammates. At 0:40 minutes you can literally see him having to set up the attack from the halfway line after a long kick from De Gea, exactly emphasizing where our problems really lie imo.

He looked like scoring if Rooney wasn't flagged offside yesterday, if that went in I guarantee nobody would be talking about his performance yesterday either by the way. By which I mean the criticism is just too much. But there's no denying he's not in brilliant form.

2075~~~
He looks devoid of confidence. I think Van Gaal has restricted him alot and took away the freedom that he thrives on. Van Gaal is not a manager who gives his players freedom and it seems like Van Persie is told not to come deep, change positions and move around like he did during his best years(one of the big reasons Ferguson signed him was because of this). He plays like a robot now. All he seems to do is make runs and remain disciplined in certain areas of the pitch. I think thats why Van Gaal always plays him because he's good at following instuctions and is probably doing what the manager wants him to do. A young player like Wilson would probably be a bit more ambitious in their play and at times vacate from his managers instructions.

2076~~~
If Rooney hadn't been flagged offside when he was clearly on in the second half van Persie would probably have scored.

2077~~~
He was piss poor under Moyes according to you, but he was our top scorer or the second. You don't play top players in the reserves for them to gain form. The way some of you go on about benching RVP, it's like that will immediately resolve all our problems. Sending a top player to the reserves is not a good idea sorry, AVB at Chelsea will tell you that. When the likes of Falcao and Mata start showing better form, and RVP continues in poor form, he'll be benched, until then, it's not going to happen.

2078~~~
Christ, is this a criticism? Nani was booed for being slow to get off, RVP getting criticized for coming off quickly, this place.

2079~~~
Even when he was on the ball though, he just looked incredibly lethargic and slow. I don't think his finishing itself is too bad some of the time, but his general game has really deteriorated.

2080~~~
The lack of service argument is really stretching. Let's ignore the Danny Welbeck finishing debate for a moment, but his work rate, motivation and will to get involved in the game yesterday was on another level to Van Persie's. He put him to shame. Rooney playing at #9 wouldn't have managed only 12 touches yesterday, no way on earth.

2081~~~
He played 38 league games in his first season. That's as injury free as it gets.

2082~~~
Lack of service can be true but if the player doesn't provide that many runs or is too slow on the ball and during linking up like RVP currently, he's never going to get enough chances. Welbeck is not a good finisher but he gets chances because he also moves, creates space and displays energy.

2083~~~
He reminds me a bit of Rooney at the start of the 2010 season were nothing goes his way.

2084~~~
normally if you're winning and under the cosh, players slope off, applauding people, shaking hands etc. he just promptly sped off...

should take lessons from my other team Wycombe's players, we're legends at time wasting.

2085~~~
This is true, but at the top level, you need more than what Welbeck gives.
Who would you feel more secure at a chance falling to? Welbeck or VP?

Welbeck had about 3 chances, VP didn't get any.

2086~~~
Probably because he didn't created them for himself, the striker needs to provoke the opportunities, at the moment RVP does nothing for himself or the team.

2087~~~
Don't remember Welbeck creating any for himself?

Headed a cross over the bar, pissed about with a crazy backheeler when played in, and from Oz's pass was blocked.
Probably a couple of others I'm forgetting.

Reminds me a bit too much of how I used to play, but it worked for me because it was the bottom level!

2088~~~
Agreed. Look at Aguero or Suarez, the two best strikers in the world, have the work-rate of Welbeck with the finishing ability of RVP.

2089~~~
It's a two-way street. van Persie could do more for the midfield, and the midfield doesn't create enough good quality chances.
I just don;'t believe that if you put Aguero, Suarez, even Rooney, and a few others up top in this side every game, they'd suffer like van Persie, despite the midfield deficiencies.

He has to do more. Problem is - I don't believe he can offer much more consistently these days.

2090~~~
Welbeck made chances for himself and contributed to the chances of others, while Van Persie did nothing at all. It doesn't even need to be Welbeck we're discussing here, he was just an example because he was the opposing forward yesterday. Merely an attacker that will push, press and actually look like making a positive impact on the game would put Van Persie to shame at present.

2091~~~
Still think he's got time to get back on form even if never quite reaches his 2011-2013 best. At least he's said recently he's not happy with his form and knows he needs to improve. Dropping him for Hull might just give him the kick up the arse he needs.

2092~~~
I'm holding off agreeing until the next 2 games.
I want to see how he does in games we'll have the majority of the possession in.

We've often gone to Arsenal in recent years and not had much of the ball, so it's not a great game to compare in.

2093~~~
By creating chances for himself i don't mean dribbling the entire opposition or something like that, but at the moment RVP is not trying to bother the defenders by moving around them, running behind them, coming back deep or things like that, he stays in the middle, make some runs and expect the perfect pass. 
I think that he needs to be more active, but i also think that he is tired, he needs some rest.

2094~~~
I'd give him a couple of games, then take action if needs be, depending on how Falcao is physically.

Mata must really wonder how his future is going to pan out though. Not starting all the games when Rooney was out  suggests he's in danger long term

2095~~~
He should be brought on as a sub for a game or two. And I'd like to see what he can do with a decent bit of service. 

On another note, I would still have this RvP over Welbeck any day.

2096~~~
As I mentioned on our podcast (shameless plug) his game vs. Latvia shows he's still capable of being effective and involved in the play. In his first season he went through that run of 10 games without scoring too. He also has a manager that believes in him (some would say van Gaal is too fond of him) and that's a positive for him mentally.

2097~~~
I think I've seen enough this season. Even if he scores, something he will always have in his locker, his play style just doesn't compliment the other players we have in the squad, in my opinion. We can be all about pace and energy going forward, yet we're being made to watch a lumbering Dutchman bang out of form.

2098~~~
I hate that word "transition" but we're in it, and you can tell Van Gaal is dealing with what he has in a lot of players. Next summer window will see some further decent changes I'm sure.

VP may well be on the exit list by then, as Van Gaal is ruthless. I wouldn't be for/against either way. If he stays, it's because his form has lifted, if he goes it hasn't.
Either way he'll have 1 year left come the summer, and you can't imagine we'll be gagging to extend a 250k contract at turning 32

2099~~~
The goal drought was different. His all round game was still routinely superb throughout that period. People are always quick to point out the chances he missed against Madrid, but his all round performance at the Bernabeu was an incredible demonstration of leading the line. Every decision he made was a correct one. He looks a million miles away from that performance right now.

2100~~~
Hernandez got slaughtered on here for better all round games than yesterday by almost all and his game was more dependent on service if anything.

Since when did RVP become a striker that totally has to be spoonfed ? Hell even for that he isn't making that many threatening runs these days and he refuses to link up with anyone up top properly either.

2101~~~
Funnily enough he's our most injury prone player yet he hasn't been injured in this nutty season.

2102~~~
Seems to have aged a lot these past two years. He's slow and predictable, and lacking the x-factor that made him such a threat. Symptoms have been there for a while, I doubt we'll see him back to his best.

Falcao should be given a run now.

2103~~~
He did beat Mcnair for pace once or twice. One leading to a save by De Gea in the 2nd half at the near post.


Anyway as i said above RVP is playing like a less mobile version of Hernandez these days than Welbeck. Don't even remember the last goal he scored which was out of nothing ?

2104~~~
I agree with you, I think he was still playing well. However, his relief at scoring scoring the penalty vs. Stoke when he went over to Ferguson showed he felt as though he needed to score and it was preying on his mind somewhat. Hopefully if he can get a few goals in the Christmas/New Year period when the games come thick and fast the rest of his game will come on.

2105~~~
It's really awful to see him so off form. Praying he gets back to his best. 
He needs to be dropped for the next couple of games, he seems nakered and hopefully to drop will give him a kick up te arse

2106~~~
Agreed. I think a lot of posters have forgotten how threatening RVP really was at his best, which he's nowhere close to and hasn't been for a very long time. Some are even saying that he hasn't declined at all, which is ridiculous.

2107~~~
Bring back Hernandez

2108~~~
Not worried really. Give him service and he will score. We've been very poor at doing so lately. He's as clinical as always, see Leicester, Chelsea.

2109~~~
He's not as clinical as always. I'm sorry but that is false. He missed a few chances before that Chelsea goal and missed a couple chances before the Leicester goal.

2110~~~
I thought that LVG arriving would spark RVP back to his best, but it doesn't seem to be happening. 

I think we have to consider the possibility that he has just reached that age and he has hit the wall. He has a lot of wear and tear given all his injuries.

2111~~~
He's never been RvN clinical- see those chances at the Bernabeu that time. What i'm saying is i think he's getting criticism that isn't really justified, people saying he's finished etc. We've been tighter recently, and haven't created chances for him. Now with the toughest games out the way for a while, i can see us creating more, and hence him proving people wrong.

2112~~~
Why?

2113~~~
This is true, I first noticed these qualities reflected in FIFA 15 which further proves it's realistic.

2114~~~
Because he'd offer more than RVP at this point

2115~~~
Or we just use Falcao, Wilson, Mata, Rooney...

2116~~~
Falcao who's perma crock, Wilson who's just a kid and mata who he clearly doesn't rate? Sure

2117~~~
It's not just his finishing though it's his overall game. I remember his performance at the Bernabeu, forget the fact he missed that chance, his overall game was superb. He has deteriorated badly in my opinion, gets bullied, can't hold it up well at all. I hope it is just form but I don't think so.

2118~~~
His general play isn't the sort of thing that should deteriorate with age though, it should just be form/confidence. Which as i say should improve once we create some chances for him and he gets scoring.

2119~~~
Wonder if his personal life has changed in anyway? Is he still with his wife? Any deaths in the family?

Just seems very strange that he has literally become useless.

2120~~~
RVP is one of those pure class acts who is a joy to watch. The fact that he only had 9 touches, in open play, yesterday is truly shocking. Hoping we can get Falcao fit so he can have rest and get back on top form

2121~~~
Di Maria set him up about 4/5 times in his first few matches, and RVP missed every single one.

2122~~~
Which games? I don't remember.

2123~~~
I know that but i was talking about this current season.

2124~~~
It was in Di Maria's first few games iirc. So Burnley/Leicester/QPR. Plus he missed a couple against Chelsea.

2125~~~
Falcao is back fit now.
Wilson is being given chances for a reason.
He obviously doesn't rate Hernandez either.

2126~~~
I'd be lying if i said i'd noticed a decline in his finishing, but i'll take your word for it. I'd still trust him to put the chances away though, if and when we can start making a few.

2127~~~
What was the game recently where he was only 5 yards out and he sliced the ball to the corner flag?

2128~~~
There must be a reason why lvg keeps on selecting him. Is it his off the ball run? Better goal poacher? Better understanding with Rooney partnership?

I mean surely Rooney up top with mata/di Maria in the hole will offer more?

Hopefully someone can give a good analysis of what Rvp does on the pitch that keeps getting him selected.

I'm scratching my head on that one.

2129~~~
He is useless.  I don't care about reputation or past abilities.  Right now he does absolutely nothing for us.

2130~~~
On form he's our best player, but the problem is he just can't seem to do anything right now. Okay he hardly gets any service but he used to create chances himself out of nowhere 12 months ago, wdf happened to that player?

If Falcao is fit and ready then RVP needs to be dropped for a bit, but I wouldn't replace RVP with Wilson because Wilson hasn't exactly done anything of note either when he's played.

2131~~~
He has scored some crucial goals already....the winner against West Ham, late goal against Chelsea....

2132~~~
Useless? Did you actually watch the match? The entire team except for the defence and GK was useless, we had zero control and could only counter attack, even Aguero and Costa would have look lost if their teams did that. For 90% of the game we were pinned into our own half like idiots, what exactly did you want him to do?

2133~~~
We were under the cosh for large periods, but saying we had zero control is rubbish. Plenty of our players put in solid performances. Not just our goalkeeper and defenders.

2134~~~
He has clearly lost something about his game. When he first joined us, he was able to create his own chances out of nothing and half chances more often than not was all that was needed to score or at least work the keeper. Yet right now he is totally reliant on other players to create chances for him, and any half chances that do drop to him more often than not get blocked by the defenders.

I'd be happy to see him dropped right now, particularly if Falcao is fit again. I'm in two minds about replacing him with Wilson. Wilson would give us that added movement, but at the same time I'm not sure if he is ready to lead the line for us on a regular bases. Ideally if Falcao can't start, you would drop RVP and push Rooney further forwards and play Mata just behind him.

2135~~~
What? Our entire midfield was pressed to death and couldn't get a hold in the game, both Carrick and Fellaini did jack all and let Arsenal impose themselves. Our attack also botched most counter attacks. So do tell me who played well then other than the defence and GK?

2136~~~
We weren't half as shit as some people are making out, we were diabolical for the first 20 or so minutes but we played well in the second half and contained Arsenal well for the most part. Fellaini certainly didn't do jack shit and if you believe that, you need to take a look at the game again instead of accusing others of not watching it in an attempt to defend RVP's poor performance.

2137~~~
I would take the risk with Wilson TBH. When RVP is becoming more of a burden for his teammates, the problem grows bigger because he's a veteran. This is where Louis should stop over-protecting RVP. By keeping a veteran who keeps on underperforming while others, some younger, provide more energy on the pitch, there could be a problem in the long run in the dressing room and frustration could grow among several individuals when it should be kept to one ATM. It's a reality that exists in all professional sports.

Until Falcao returns, Wilson should be in and RVP should serve time on the bench. Either way, something has to be done before it has ramifications inside the dressing room.

2138~~~
time for him to be dropped!

2139~~~
12 touches 3 of which corners against a big rival - not good enough. He doesnt look at it remotely currently! Needs to be dropped and see if he can make impact from the bench and if not he stays there.

2140~~~
I've said it before, but he looks old and feeble at the moment.
Arteta dispossessed him comfortably a couple of times on Saturday and he is probably the weakest player in the league.
Yes - he didn't get much service, but he's got to offer more than that I'm afraid.
Would bench him immediately. Either Falcao or Wilson starts ahead of him from here on in. If Falcao isn't fit, then Wilson it is - and I think LVG has the balls to do it.

2141~~~
I reckon he's shot. Looks like we'll have to wait and see whether can he recapture his form.

2142~~~
RVP is in short of confidence give him time and he will come good.
I think our defensive injuries means we have change our general style of play which didn't help him.
Yes there are worries sign but some of criticism are way to over the top.

2143~~~
I refuse to believe that RVP is past it. Obviously it is possible with his age and his injuries but Im not there yet in terms of accepting its happened. 

I say drop him for a couple of games and then bring him on as a sub in a few games, like maybe against Southampton depending on the circumstances and see what he looks like then. 

The bottom line is he isnt delivering right now and Rooney will do a better job in his position, we have very good cover for Rooney's position so it makes sense. Then the onus is on RVP to play himself back into the team, which I believe he can do. If he cant then its sad but between Falcao, Rooney and Wilson we have competition for that spot. 

Someone said it yesterday: you can blame the service for his lack of involvement in the game but it is almost inconceivable that Rooney would have gone the entire game with less than 10 touches or whatever it was. He might not have done a great deal with it if he was having an off day but no way would he let the game pass him by like that, he would have come deep to make something happen for himself. 

Its bizarre what is going on with him at the moment. It is exactly what Van Gaal was supposed to be famous for NOT doing, playing people on reputation rather than what they are actually offering.

2144~~~
Stop talking rubbish, you clearly didn't watch the game if you think Fellaini played well. He was average at best.

2145~~~
I have just seen the game again and that performance by RVP was one of the worst performances by a United player I have seen in the last 15 yrs. A lot of our players did pretty well after the first 20 minutes,  Rooney and ADM both playing in attacking roles made themselves available for the ball, pressed hard without it and created a few openings. Fellaini stole the ball away so many times in midfield and did do an OK job keeping it. Now coming to RVP, he had 12 touches out of which 3 were corners he took. Everytime the ball was played to him he lost it easily getting physically bullied by Arteta twice. I genuinely can't think of one thing he did well in the 70 minutes he was on the pitch for.

2146~~~
He has played a lot of football in the last 5-6 months or so, and this is probably coming at the wrong time for him in terms of his age. I think it would make more sense to give him a bit of a break, let him come in off the bench for the last 20 minutes in a few games, and re-build up his confidence and fitness levels. He's definitely not finished, but I think he could really benefit from a bit of a rest.

2147~~~
There was one moment: He spun his man on the halfway line once, in the second half on the break. And then passed to Di Maria who was offside.
I nearly fell off my seat.

2148~~~
Should've been dropped long time ago yet regulary gets his chance to stink on the field. LVG should stop with favoritism and play either Rooney up top, or Falcao when healthy, RVP shouldn't be anywhere near starting eleven.

2149~~~
The man gets no service. His main supplier should be whoever is playing in the No 10 role, Rooney or Mata, but despite RVP's movement and raising his hand for the ball, he does not get it.
Instead of going for glory themselves other players should feed the player who's role on the team is to put the ball in the net. That's what Chelsea and City are doing.

2150~~~
He spun, Di Maria looked offside so he waited, then Di Maria ran into offside again, I completely lost it after that, like wtf. Pretty much summed it up, very unlucky situation, literally 95/100 times Di Maria would've been through on goal. I imagine LvG and his video-analysis obsessed staff will definitely use that moment to try and improve.

To be fair, 2.5 months ago ago Ajax played vs PSG in the Champions League. Zlatan made comments before the match how it was a special match for him, first time playing against his old club and all. He failed to make an impact and didn't score, playing against Joel Veltman (midget) and Moisander (poor man's Vertonghen). I remember reading a lot of comments on both Ajax and neutral boards (are there PSG forums? I should check that out) how Zlatan might be past it, aged 33 and looking slow. Based on that match the criticism seemed fair, and I guess the same goes for RVP. Elite strikers should always do more and should always be the best player on the pitch. If they're not, they get slack, unfair as that may seem.

2151~~~
According to Daily Mail (just read the headline) RVP on had 13 touches against Arsenal and 3 were corners, 2 must be from kick off so 8 in open play!!

Lvg has some explaining to do if he is picking Fellaini over Herrera due to form them Wilson or Mata should be on the pitch not RVP?

2152~~~
Some of his runs have been pretty good, but his finishing has generally been shit. It's been obvious at times that our other attackers have decided to go it alone rather than make the pass. I don't think the rest of the team has the unimpeachable confidence in him that they used to. He's still useful in dragging defenders away, but he needs to start finishing chances when he gets them or he'll never be anything other than a dummy runner again.

2153~~~
Short of confidence? I don’t think so. He’s playing regularly in his best position under his fellow manager. How much time do you think he needs?

Confidence seems to be the most common excuse these days. I remember people saying Valencia’s “form” is a matter of confidence despite both SAF and Moyes playing him week-in week-out. IMO RvP just needs a rest right now. And he should not be a starter for us (considering how many options in attack we have).

2154~~~
Sorry to say, but I think he's past it already. He's had one world class season, followed by a decent season(seeing as he was injured half the time), followed by his possible decline in the third. If he fails to recover, will he go down as a good or bad signing?

I think it boils down to this: do you think we would have won the 2013 season without RVP?

If the answer is "no", then he was a good signing after all. But if the answer is "yes", then I struggle to see how this was a good signing. He alienated Kagawa, Welbeck and Hernandez and forced us to try a weak partnership(Rooney + RVP). I think the team as a whole would have been much better off if we never signed RVP. But it remains to be seen. If he recovers, then I might have to eat those words.

2155~~~
It's not often that top players suddenly are just done - there usually is a decline but, it's not unheard of. Torres comes to mind - world class to a joke in an instant. RVP seems to have taken that path. There have been odd games here and there but, for the most part he seems like he's just done as a top player. Hope that's not the case but, right now can't see what it would take for him to get back to his old self - he is playing all the time, in 'small' games where he should dominate and in big games where he should look up for it but, doesn't.

We are not putting enough pressure on opposing CB right now and if LVG actually wants us to start scoring goals more regularly, he needs to put RVP on the bench for a few games.

2156~~~
He definitely is on very poor form at the moment, no one can deny that. His reactions are slow, he often hesitates to make a decision and needs one too many touches on the ball. He also seems to be very low on confidence in the last couple of games. But he also had some decent games this season, don't forget that he worked his arse off in the Everton game when we down to ten men. If he had scored one or two goals when he had a clear chance (his missed opportunity against Burnley is one that comes in mind) and given us some points, we would be having a different discussion.

The problem we have in creating goal scoring opportunities is more general and i think it's in the core of LvG's thoughts whenever he mentions the word philosophy. Dropping RvP won't make us attacking juggernauts, i only wish it was that simple. Imo the problem goes deeper, it's about our ability to create pockets of space in the final third without using pace but good off the ball movement and our brains.

The whole team seems to be struggling in that area atm, not only RvP. I think that LvG used to play RvP every week in the beginning of the season because he thought that he didn't need any time to adopt to the new style of football. But we must not forget that Falcao is van Gaal's signing too. I believe that if Falcao becomes fit and shows the manager during the training sessions that he can do the job better than RvP he will find his way in the starting line up.

Same thing goes for Wilson. The utilization of our youngsters and of players like Fellaini and Valencia shows that if a player can help the team's plan on the pitch LvG has no problem to use him. I also believe there aren't that many options available as some think. It's not like we have many points of reference in the team. There's Rooney, Carrick (although he seems a very low profile player) and De Gea who will become a point of reference (and probably one of the captains) if/when he signs his new contract. It's necessary to insist on some experienced players when the whole team tries to improve under a new manager. The players who didn't get playing time are always the "best" if the result is bad or if there are some under performers. LvG probably believes that our attacking woes are a team problem and not the fault of any individual.

What makes it worse for RvP is that he's the forward who must play in the box, between the CBs, and our inability to attack through the middle and get players on the ball in between the lines doesn't allow him to have many quality touches on the ball himself or many good angles to shoot. Anyway, there are rumors about Cavani once more and it will be interesting to see LvG's decisions on the matter.

2157~~~
Is it sudden though? he's been way below par since SAF retired basically.

2158~~~
I think so, absolutely. Fair enough, he turned draws into wins etc.. But would those games have actually needed winning so often had we played a front three of Kagawa, Rooney and Welbeck (and maybe spent that £25 million on a midfielder)?

I don't believe so. Our football would have been better, and it still would be now.
However, I guess you could say he was worth it simply because he didn't join City, where he may or may not have had a similar individual impact and given them a boost.

At the end of the day, I think his signing solved something that didn't really need solving (our goalscoring) while creating a handful of problems.

2159~~~
Its not suddn though, is it? People say it was when fergie retired, but even the second half of 2012/13 he became more inconsistent, not the greatest finishing, but still very good on the whole. It was probably the start of the decline. Last season he had good finishing but really didn't do much in games. This season, his finishing has deserted him and he's pretty much useless.

2160~~~
Di Maria would have had another 5 assists if RvP took his chances really, a couple against both Leicester and burnley, missed some big chances set up by januzaj against Chelsea, missed that rebound against palace, and there have been others. It's been happening in pretty much every game. If RvP had his finishing from 2-3 seasons ago, just the finishing, he would've had around 10 goals by now probably. Part of why we've been struggling to get results, our strikers haven't been clinical like they were under fergie.

2161~~~
It's a combination of multiple things, once the team gets going and we start actually playing attacking football RVP will eventually come good again.

2162~~~
This is what i've been saying but a couple have remarked that Van Persie has been missing chances he'd have buried 2 years ago. Can't say i've noticed, i just put it down to what you just said.

2163~~~
I'm not sure. I was defending him for a while and expecting him to still do well, even if he didn't find his very best football again, but I'm not even sure we'll see that now. He just looks incredibly off the pace, and as if his most recent injuries have really affected him badly. I still have a small level of hope you're right though.

2164~~~
I actually meant from the start of last season. People said it was Moyes doing and him not liking Moyes but, the same has transferred into this season.

2165~~~
Alan Smith, Telegraph, reckons RVPs legs have gone and it's looking increasingly so. It's almost as though he's lost his athleticism overnight.

2166~~~
Pogue Mahone, Redcafe, agrees.

2167~~~
He is becoming a liability and I really think he is a fantastic player but right now its like we start games with 10 men. I hope Wilson gets a start against Hull especially after last season and with a fit again Falcao to start getting game time also. 
Just think he needs to sit out a game or two, refresh his legs and come back hungry but if a spell being dropped doesn't improve him then he may well be on a terminal decline, if that's the case he doesn't deserve a guaranteed start anymore.
Whether LvG will drop his mate though is a different matter all together.

2168~~~
With Rooney playing the way he is and Falcao being injured, this is the best time to switch to a one striker system that lends the squad a lot of balance, beef up the midfield with more players who can retain possession and shield an inexperienced defense. RvP could well be gone in the summer, we do not have to pick up the option on Falcao, bring back Chicharito if Madrid do not want him as a back up and go 4-3-3 which is an Gaal's preferred system.

2169~~~
It sort of gets to the point that even if we're seeing a blip and not the beginning of the end, can we really wait for him to get his form back? At his age and with his injury history I'd be amazed to still (possibly redundant) see him doing it at this level in a couple of years. I'm not sure there's an enormous amount to be gained by waiting for a guy who, even forgetting his chequered injury record, is on the way down if most other players are anything to go by.

2170~~~
Maybe we can limit his match time to just diving headers.

2171~~~
Thank god journalists are usually wrong.

2172~~~
I still think he was pretty much at his 12/13 level in the first few months of the Moyes season until he picked up his first injury. A great header in the Community Shield, 2 brilliant goals against Swansea and some other good efforts like the header vs. Arsenal. After he came back in January was when he form became mixed even though he was still scoring.

2173~~~
Yeah, he wasn't anywhere near as bad last season as he is right now. I can't imagine him scoring a goal like the Swansea ones last year, right now. The dramatic dip in quality is quite shocking tbh.

2174~~~
We'll still see occasional flashes of brilliance from him, but I reckon the days of him delivering world class performances week in, week out, or consistently winning matches by himself, are likely over. Bizarre how suddenly things seem to have come on, but it's not like he's the first player that's ever happened to.

2175~~~
This is how I felt during the Arsenal game.
At times I was wondering if he was on the pitch or perhaps getting medical help off the pitch.
On match of the day, they stated that he only had 14 touches (I think)...which is incredible.

2176~~~
It still really pisses me off that Moyes tried to rush him back to fitness from that groin injury last season around December. A player in his prime, when it looked like he was finally beginning get over his problems too. Van Persie ended up missing so many games because of the busy Christmas schedule and despite Rooney & Welbeck salvaging some league wins by the time he came back for the game vs. Cardiff we were in shocking form. Beaten by Spurs who'd just sacked their manager, out of the FA and League Cup, demolished by Chelsea etc.

2177~~~
“I think if I’d brought him off some people would say ‘What are you doing? You are 1-0 down and you’re taking off your top goalscorer.’

2178~~~

2179~~~
He bangs them in for Holland and people still think there's something wrong with him... The truth is he's not getting clean service and there's no point in him dropping deep the past few games because there's nobody else high enough for him to actually do something with it. In the Arsenal game the few times we did actually manage to carry the ball out to him he fluffed up, but both of the times I remember was because of Di Maria's awkward runs across him.

2180~~~
He's been shit for Holland since the first 2 games of the World Cup consistently except the last game where they hammered some minnow.

Many dutch fans wanted him dropped for Huntelaar or sm1 else too.

2181~~~
Bangs them in for Holland? Not true at all. And if he does, its vs Latvia etc. Great vs Spain, good goal vs Australia, that's about it in the past half year for him.

2182~~~
Dont take us too seriously, the majority also wants Blind to be dropped for Clasie.

2183~~~
Doesn't Blind play LB or LWB ?

2184~~~
Yes I also read about his touches or lack of, crazy stat. 
There is loyalty and blind loyalty I just hope van Gaal makes the right decision, no one should start every match especially when they are offering so very little.

2185~~~
Yeah, but Willems has picken up some serious form and they want him there, as he offers more pace, power. So Blind is shifted to midfield, and de Jong was/is not available.

2186~~~
Says he could have only played 60/70 minutes, then makes him play 90 incase people criticise him. Then brings him on for 30 minutes in pretty much a dead rubber group game vs. Shakhtar just 3 days later with Hernandez sat on the bench having barely played any minutes. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2187~~~
I've been worried about RvP since last season.  At first I just put it down to Moyes-ball not suiting him but then the World Cup came and he wasn't much better (wonder goal and the odd good game here and there).  The spark has gone from his play since SAF left. I get the feeling it is a confidence and motivational problem but it could be that he is losing his pace.  Not sure dropping him will kick him back to life either, might be he needs a big game to bring the life back into him.  Either way, we can't carry him, the team isn't good enough to carry a player right now.

2188~~~
He's in the Torres, Shevchenko phase IMO, I mean he's playing his favourite position under a manager he has a great relationship with and is producing nothing. Look at Suarez at Pool last year or Aguero at City, so much of what they do in games where the team is playing poorly is to make things happen on their own off scraps, not waiting for it on a plate, that's what top #9's are expected to do. 

Aguero turning two long balls where he is outnumbered into goals against QPR while City were playing shite is a prime example, Ruud did that with half chances for us back in the day and Rooney did it over and over for us in the 09/10 season when he played up top alone, there were many poor overall performances but time and again he made something happen and got us points. At this juncture RvP can barely even hold the ball up to bring others into play, a main facet of playing as a lone striker.

2189~~~
I'd convinced myself that the only reason LvG was persisting with him is because of his hold-up play which is probably the only thing he's decent at atm, but it was utterly wank on Saturday - (was good against Chelsea iirc). I was arguing that he should be picked for the game against Arsenal because I thought he'd be well up for it, and although I don't think he's not giving effort, having him in the side is  bit like playing with ten men atm.

2190~~~
Who cares? No, we wouldn't have won the title without him. None of those 3 players were a big loss.

2191~~~
I disagree, and does many(most?) others. First of all, the league was way too shite and Fergie way too experienced, for us not to win that year. Secondly, players like Kagawa, Rooney, Welbeck and Hernadez would all most likely have stepped up a notch, making the team better<i> overall</i>.

That is sort of the point. RVP stagnated their progress. If we never signed him, these 3 <i>would</i> have been a big loss now, as they'd all likely have improved immensely. We basically sacrificed 3 promising players + team balance in order to fit in a star that most likely only lasted for a season. I don't think that's worth it.

2192~~~
Unfortunately, it's more than just our team playing bad. On current form, I doubt he'd play much better if the whole team would play well. He's badly out of form (and somehow out of shape). I can't judge on his fitness levels but he's surely not at his physical best (and that for some time now).

2193~~~
Didn't realize RvP was already 31. Yep, he's definitely done.

2194~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> 31 is still young and virile.

2195~~~
Not if you're Owen Hargreaves, Michael Owen, or Robin van Persie.

2196~~~
Agreed. I think people forget that we had no problems scoring goals the season before he came. Welbeck and Rooney had potential, and the little bits of Kagawa and Rooney looked promising.

I definitely agree we could have won the league without him, and we could be better for it now, had we not signed him.

I look back at the signing as unnecessary, and possibly a mistake.

2197~~~
I remember the early 2000's when Giggs and Scholes were "done" for most fans, funny how life goes.

2198~~~
Definitely a luxury signing that no one anticipated, but still a very important one for the first year he was here.

2199~~~
Time catches up with everyone. Robin was never that quick in the first place, so I think he still has plenty to offer. Reality says that the modern game is heavily influenced by pace and we will needed a complete forward who embodies all the skills necessary to play as a lone striker. RVP will be fantastic coming off the bench when we are chasing a goal.

Someone posted the interview with Comolli, who brought up an interesting stat about the success of teams trailing off significantly when their strikers are over 27. We have some big names up front but they are all at the wrong end of their careers. Rooney's future is as a number 10. Would love to see Wilson get a chance up front, and wouldn't be surprised to see us spend big on a forward in the next 18 months.

2200~~~
The biggest problem for RVP is that being technically brilliant really isn't good enough for a top level striker anymore - unless you're the icing on the proverbial cake. All of the top teams have forward players that work incredibly hard and extremely 'active' - even if they're not scoring a ton. Players like Benzema spend the whole match running into channels and creating space - as well as harassing defenders. Suarez is probably the peak player of that type, Rooney was similar when deployed up top. Welbz too, though obviously without the goal scoring. And playing against Costa for 90 minutes must be incredibly draining. 

Having RVP is like playing with 10 men some of the time. He attempted 3 passes on Saturday. 3!!! A traffic cone would probably of been as productive in that Arsenal defense. It's a little bit like Berbatov - the talent is outrageous - but in today's game application is almost more important. To be solely a goal-scorer you have to either be able to create by yourself (which RVP can't) or have a team that is significnatly better than anyone else. Neither is true for us. 

I think he'd be an excellent sub though. Get him on running about for 25 minutes. If his ego can take it.

2201~~~
I was going to say the exact same thing, the man has no acceleration left in him. We can see that in the training video.

2202~~~
At the end of the day, that's all speculation. We won the title with RVP in the side, so he was worth it. Hernandez was a regular in his first season with us, and was doing well, but then started regressing. I don't think that was because of RVP. He just started losing form, and also defences started figuring him out. Welbeck - well, we'll see. I don't see it, and I think Saturday's game said it all about him. He's had plenty of chances up front at this stage, and we'll see how he does long term with Arsenal. All I know is, when we were under the cosh the other day, I repeatedly felt myself thinking "Thank God it's Welbeck up top who their chances are likely to fall to". No matter how poor a run of form RVP is in, I doubt Arsenal fans were thinking that.

As for Kagawa .. I'm not even going to bother discussing him with you, I think even non English speaking rural Thai grandmother's know about your man love for him. ;-)

2203~~~
Hopefully van Gaal realises that. Rest the man and he might be some use near the end of the season. His time is running out I fear.

2204~~~
I blame Moyes and his bleeding double running sessions <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/> those alone aged our Robin by 5 seasons or more.

fecking moyes!

<span style="color: #ffffff">joking</span>

2205~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
I still think that kagawa behind Rooney could have been a success.<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2206~~~
Of course, but it's all <i>valid </i>speculation.

Because of RVP, Kagawa had to play on the wing. It didn't suit him, and stagnated his development. Welbeck could hardly play a minute in the striker position, and was basically second string to Kagawa on the left wing. Hernandez barely featured at all. And then we have Rooney, who had his worst season for a long time. He just doesn't suit RVP.

If we didn't sign RVP, then Kagawa would have played in his favored position. Welbeck and Hernandez would have gotten a ton of playtime, both in their favored position and on the wing(in Welbeck's case). You are free to believe that this wouldn't have been better for the team in that particular season. But you can't deny that these 3 players would have had a much better time and developed much more.

That is why I will always view this transfer as a mistake. We threw 3 very promising players under the bus for 1, who probably only lasted for one season. A season that we most likely would have won anyways. I'm not gonna deny that he had an excellent season. But that season alone is not worth it for me.

But what's done is done. We have to move forward. Luckily, we have many new gems now(Di Maria, Herrera and Blind).

2207~~~
So ... essentially, you're blaming one world class talent (when we signed him, and in his great first year for us) for the fact that 3 other players could not adapt? I have a differing opinion to you. Kagawa - he just wasn't suited to English football, nor to playing for a club of the size of Manchester United. He'll be fine now that he's back where he feels comfortable, but he just didn't have the balls to step up at one of the world's biggest clubs. 

Welbeck - he's a decent footballer, and he did fine in his time with us. But he's reached his peak. He thinks he's a far better striker than he actually is, and his time at Arsenal will prove that (course I could be wrong on that one, just my opinion). 

Rooney did have a bad season. But that was mostly down to falling out with Fergie and wanting to move on at that time. He's now playing well again in my opinion (albeit I personally prefer him up front) and RvP is still there. So I don't buy into it regarding him either.

I don't think Hernandez is good enough anymore to be starting for United. I don't think that had anything to do with RVP. He simply tailed off.

I can deny that they wouldn't have developed much more to be honest. It's up to players to prove they are good enough to oust other players. Those players could not do it. The better player started, I don't feel signing RVP was remotely a mistake. Neither was signing Hernandez, as he did a great job in his first year. We developed Welbeck as far as we could, selling him wasn't a mistake.

Signing Kagawa was a mistake.

2208~~~
Just browsing our <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Teams/32" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stats page</a> at WhoScored, and was surprised to see that Van Persie has played more minutes in the league this season than any other of our outfield players. Not necessarily because I don't think he should've, but because he missed the first games, and seems to get substituted a lot. And yet there it is: more minutes on the pitch than anyone else barring De Gea.

2209~~~
Have to agree with Mad Winger here.

I agree with you that you can't blame van Persie for the other guys' failings, but when you state the signing of Kagawa was a mistake, I simply have to disagree.
For me, Kagawa fitted in perfectly to what we had going for us with Welbeck and Rooney; van Persie didn't.
I think Kagawa would have complemented Welbeck and Rooney in an attack given time to gel, whereas I always thought van Persie wouldn't. I've never seen him as someone who plays well with others close by him - "In his areas"

Signing both in the same window was silly, in my opinion, and it just demonstrated a desire to regain the title from City that year, even if it would set us back after and leave a few problems. To win at all costs. <i>"As long as we won"</i> I think Evans said.
We actually didn't need him. The problem wasn't actually there to be solved. And I think there were other motives behind signing him beyond improving our team, personally.

It worked, for that season.. But I think we could have won without him, and would be in better shape now without doubt.

I'd definitely go back and stop us signing van Persie, and spend that money on a midfielder, if I could go back. Even with the knowledge that he'd play a big part in number 20.

2210~~~
His contract ends in the summer doesn't it?

If Falcao doesn't proove his worth, next summer is going to be mouthwatering for us transfer muppets. We're going to be in for a superstar striker or two <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2211~~~
2016. 4 year deal.

2212~~~
Ah right I thought we signed him on a short 3 year deal with a 1 year option.

I still think we will be in for another striker in the summer.

2213~~~
He does look quite a bit slower, overall. He doesn't have the energy that made him the dynamic, dangerous striker that he was before Sir Alex retired. His movement has also worsened to the point where he's almost always stagnant. The thing that really gets to me is that his technique is still top notch, and he's a very intelligent footballer who's great at reading the game. It's just sad to see that he can't apply himself like he used to in the past.

He's become more static off the ball and slower on the ball. He's become too easy to dispossess, and he struggles to get involved in the game. The movement that he demonstrated in his first season with us is pretty much absent nowadays. He really is in poor form right now and looks like he needs to not play for a few games to get back to his best.

However, one thing that makes van Persie struggle is the fact that he's so isolated. Every time he has a bad match, he's quite often isolated and lacks support. Two things are causing this:
<ol>
<li>He's getting a lack of attacking support</li>
<li>His lack of energy and dynamism makes it difficult for him to shake off the opposition.</li>
</ol>Given how often isolated he is, he's going to have a tough time handling the opposition in his current physical state. We're currently better off with a more active striker than van Persie like Rooney or Falcao, both of who are more dynamic in their game. van Persie, nowadays, is better off for me as more of a withdrawn player who won't have to deal with being isolated so often.

2214~~~
Ah yeah, look that's fair enough. That's your opinion.

I just simply didn't see enough from Kagawa in his time with us to show me that he was the answer for anything. I don't think he was the type of player who would grab big games for us, and I felt he wilted under the microscope of playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world, outside his own little system.

Whereas Van Persie has thrived with a few clubs now, and under various international managers.

Just my own feeling, but there's no way to prove it either way.

2215~~~
I was thinking is that possible to transform him into a sort of Totti, who is also speedless ?

2216~~~
Its nowt to do with age, more about him being a steaming shit right now.

2217~~~
<a class="username" data-user="82626, @dirkey" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82626/">@dirkey</a>

Well, I'm gonna have to disagree. Without RVP, Kagawa and Welbeck would have played more than twice as much in their favored position. Hernandez would probably have doubled his overall playtime. Needless to say that this would have done them a world of good. Especially Kagawa.

There's no way of proving that either of these three would have turned out good without RVP. But there's a fair chance at least one of them would. And that would totally have been worth it, if we ended up winning the season after all.

I agree with Speak. If I could go back in time and not sign RVP, then I most definitely would.

2218~~~
I would never revisit that decision. He won us the league in 2012 and he got us to the Champions league ties against Bayern last season. He has been a great acquisition but he's been useless this year.

2219~~~
I think we would have won regardless. I don't deny that he was great <i>that </i>year, though.

Under Moyes he spent half the time injured and was only a shadow of himself. He had a decent goals/assist ratio, which is the only thing that "saved" his season for me. Not overly impressed.

And now he's shit. I have a bad feeling he'll never even reach 80% of what he was in 2012-2013 again. And if that was to happen, I'll even go as far as to say that it was a <i>horrible </i>signing. Definitely not worth throwing 3 promising players under the bus for.

But it's obvious that people will have different opinions here. If you think that we wouldn't have won that season without RVP and that Kagawa, Welbeck and Hernandez never had a shot anyways, then of course this signature is gonna be considered good. But for the rest of us, it's not.

2220~~~
Aside from scoring a last gasp equaliser vs Chelsea. He should be dropped, but 'useless' is a bit harsh.

2221~~~
Should be giving a long rest to accommodate Falcao and if he doesn't recover his form to some degree or he should be shipped off.  Legend and reason for our 20th title but legend of not we shouldn't be keeping players around for the sake of it, especially when they're on 200k a week.

2222~~~
I don't think Kagawa, Welbeck and Hernandez leaving was necessarily down to signing van Persie, I think it was more down to Ferguson leaving. We'll never know, but I think Ferguson would have sold Rooney if he was still in charge and Kagawa would have been given a chance to make it as a 10. Moyes keeping him and then getting him to sign a fat new contract is what did for Shinji ultimately- Mata in January sealed the deal. If Rooney had gone, maybe Welbeck and Hernandez (who I think had a very impressive 12/13 season) would have been given more chances to play as a CF and would still be here.

2223~~~
RvP has not been a runner for the last few years. He's at his best in and around the box, but given the crap we have played in the attacking third of the pitch, it's no wonder he has been struggling. If LvG wants to continue to play this current formation, then he may as well start with Wilson, who will run all day and may get on the end of a fast break.

2224~~~
I don't think SAF would have ever sold Rooney, whatever the magnitude of their falling out. It would have been sorted IMO, as Fergie knew better than anyone how important he is to us. Kagawa would have also been an awful replacement for Rooney in the number 10 position. I'm not sure how anybody would think otherwise unless they're a blatant Kagawa fanboy like Mad Winger.

2225~~~
Van Persie needs resting, playing him into form is looking a failed exercise, Wilson should start against Hull and we should introduce Falcao at the first opportunity. He's far from gone as a player though, that's some knee jerk bullshit right there, never been reliant on pace or his running but were never going to see the best of him playing from the right in a countering formation, the Arsenal game was a right off for VP.

2226~~~
You could be right, I just remember at the time when he was dropped for the Madrid game it felt very much as though van Persie was the star and the signs weren't good for him. The reaction to him receiving the medal was another clue. Maybe Ferguson would have ditched Kagawa anyway or continued to play him out of position, he certainly didn't seem as ruthless in his later years as before when players could all of sudden find themselves gone like the season when Ince, Highes and Kanchelskis all went. Not sure people such as Anderson, Young, Nani and Valencia would have lasted as long as they have were they in the 90's era after they declined.

2227~~~
You have to admire mad wingers ability to bring Kagawa into every single thread <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2228~~~
What makes me worried about the consistent fielding of Van Persie is not only about results,but also about ramifications in the dressing room. Regardless of LVG being an experienced manager who knows how to manage a team, one constant variable remains in all of professional team sports: if the coach/manager keeps on fielding players who are a hindrance, many others will grow frustrated and angry towards the coach/manager. Now people can call me alarmist for raising the issue up, but I can assure you that it is not something to take lightly as far as the reality of professional sports goes. It is a very dangerous game.

Until now, LVG can breathe a little with the current position at 4th. Hence this is why I believe he has to take Van Persie out of the starting lineup now when not many people are frustrated in that dressing room. Better do it now than later. We don't know how long Falcao will take before being deemed fit for first team action, but Wilson has shown he's more than capable of taking his share of workload even if it doesn't mean playing full matches (giving him 65-70 minutes is fine by me). Either way, I don,t think many people in the dressing room would feel surprised if LVG sends Van Persie to the bench from now on.

We are in need of speed and energy, so then field players who have speed and energy.

2229~~~
So he's back to taking the corners from the right, instead of Di Maria. What's all that about?

2230~~~
His user name is very apt, the bloody loony.

2231~~~
Di Maria was awful at them. RvP was quite good a few seasons ago I think so I don't have a problem with it.

2232~~~
Apart from Rooney I don't think we have much option, Falco need to fully fit and that will also takes time. Wilson still need to learn lot.
Now as confidence, some time its takes little more time to regroup and get back confidence.
The way we play our last 2 -3 games should not bring any conclusion. With all injury situation we have to adjust our play which really not working for him.
Let give him game against Hull and Stoke, if he still not able to do anything good then we need to worry.
We all know how class player he is, we need to give him time to settle.

2233~~~
Its because we have awful lot of injuries, 
You can't get any consistency when there are too much change going on.

2234~~~
That's the thing. Who would you play? Mata or Persie? If anything, Mata is more in need of starting/playing the next 2 matches than Persie.

2235~~~
I fear the way we are playing dropping off then trying to counter is never going to suit RVP. Would have suited Welbecks style more. If we start dominating games more and playing in oppositions half the RVP will shine again as in and around the box there are few that's better. But putting balls into the channels for him just doesn't suit.

2236~~~
I think the only reason Mata not playing is we need player in that position who can drop back to help defense.
I don't know what LVG thinking but right now, he is preferring players in midfield who can help defense.

2237~~~
Contrary to popular belief, Mata can drop back and help the defense.

2238~~~
We can blame van Persie all we want, but just take a look at the amount of touches he's had. He never gets the ball at all. We never play through the middle and our crossing has stopped all of a sudden. He cannot do anything without the ball.

Though it can also be read as he doesn't get into any good positions as well. But according to me, I think it's the former. Midfield with Fellaini means RvP is completely isolated upfront. Our midfield needs to provide him with good service. Rooney drops too deep to get the ball but never tries to find van Persie. He always tries to play a short pass to a different midfielder or a cross field pass to the wings. RvP doesn't work hard enough like Welbeck or Wilson to get the ball back. But why should he? We need to be much better as a team to create more chances per game and it's largely the midfield's fault. We have too many players who take the safe route back and have very less creativity. It will increase our possession but it's of no fecking use when all we do is just randomly pass the ball amongst ourselves and pose no danger to the opponent. Valencia and Fellaini are the biggest culprits. Herrera offers so much more that's why I like him. 

van Persie isn't a goal poacher. He needs to have more than a few touches of the ball and he's more than capable of scoring screamers from outside the box. He likes the ball to be played at his feet. He doesn't rely on speed so age is not a factor in his deterioration. It's the midfield. We need to learn to play narrow and be more creative with the ball. Get RvP involved more. He's still in the top bracket of strikers and we are wasting him.

2239~~~
I can't believe how some peoples views on RvP have changed. Yes, he's not been great this season, but he won us the league by being unbelievable. We never had the midfield with passing and movement behind Kagawa to make it work, and Welbeck wouldn't of been a reliable enough source of goals. Even a poor RvP this season is outscoring Welbeck.

2240~~~
You are very patient if you want to give him 2 more games. He is the player who played most minutes for us this season mind you. I do not see a point in playing him right now. There are two aspects of this case:

Firstly, he has been in poor form from the start of the season. He scored a couple of goals but overall his performances have been underwhelming. Not something I’m worried about though, as we have a lot of options up top.

Secondly, we are playing pretty shite football. We just don’t create scoring chances, and unless we start doing it, I don’t see a point in playing RvP from the start. Combining those two issues, he is useless for us right now. Once we settle down a little bit, sort out the defence and find some balance in attack, I’m sure he will score a lot for us. Just right now we should be looking for another options.

It’s not his form that’s worrying right now. It’s the decision to play him every single week from the start that’s bothering me.

2241~~~
Exactly what I have been saying. The only person who actively seeks out RVP is Falcao and he has been injured. Rooney is more concerned with scoring than setting up RVP thus his classic cross field pass to the Right wing and then a run into the box for the return. I can recall only one pass Rooney made to set up RVP in the box. RVP likes one-twos around the box but no-one seems wiling to participate. Its really frustrating to watch and I don't think much will change if Falcao replaces RVP.

2242~~~
It's about time you feck off with Rooney agenda. While RVP joggs around uninterested, rest of the team works their socks off yet it's poor RVP who's been neglected? He has limited service alright, but even when he gets put through he can't find the net. He's like a grandpa among men, easily pushed off the ball, can't sustain tackle, doesnt have stamina or pace to last full 90min and looks like he's 65y not 31. And of course it's Rooney fault,just as he forced poor Nani out of United. I really don't like being rude but you're prick of a highest order and you can quote me on that.

2243~~~
The Rooney-RvP partnership is non-existent but you really can't criticize Rooney for that those days, he has been doing much more this season than the last one. RVP on the other hand is invisible for 90% of the time on the pitch.

2244~~~
He's going to start all games he's fit for unless he needs to be rested this season, I have lost my hope in terms of van Gaal actually benching him. It's clear as a day they like each other.

2245~~~
As they would say in Fifa 14: "He's enjoying a sticky spell at the moment, but the manager has asked him to play his way through it."

I think he needs a break. I know he had one after the world cup, but Rooney/Wilson/Falcao can take his place for now and maybe he'll start living up to his potential if he has some more competition coming back into the side. He's pretty much guaranteed on the starting sheet, and maybe the doubt of a starting place will motivate him after some rest.

2246~~~
Van Gaal should know better than anyone that managers have been sacked in different sports for showing too much favoritism towards one or a few individuals while detrimental to the the team's performances. While we are getting results and no one is too angry among the players at the moment, it should be easier to pull him out of the team. Dragging things longer will not help anybody, especially not if we hit a bad streak.

This is fecking depressing.

Still a top class footballer. Just needs better service and momentum.

2249~~~
Yeah, that's what it is. Nothing to do with his disinterest, loss of physicality, lack of sharpness and just a general laboured approach to matches.

2250~~~
I'm not sure. Watching him, it feels like he's definitely lost a certain level of sharpness that he had before.

2251~~~
Don't worry Robin, you don't have to butter us up. We aren't Arsenal, we know when we're out of the race.

2252~~~
My verdict: LvG MUST be seeing something positive from RVP to warrant starting him.  Otherwise, he could just play Rooney as a 9 with Januzaj or Mata as the 10 until Falcao gets fit.

2253~~~
We need a forward closer to him (FALCAO!).

He never really got any service or movement around him against Arsenal.

2254~~~
He needs to be the closest striker to the midfield. Swap Rooney and him around and see what happens.

2255~~~
RvP put in a very good shift against city and was immense against Chelsea. He had to hold the ball with none of our players anywhere near him and he did that brilliantly. I don't understand what you mean by can't sustain a tackle? It's not like he gets out-muscled easily. His hold up play and ball shielding is too good for his lean physique.

He misses more than a few chances but it boils down to lack of opportunities. He never gets enough one on ones to be in form. Once he scores a few, his finishing improves drastically.

You are underestimating RvP way too much

2256~~~
Immense against Chelsea? Lets go with he was good.

2257~~~
Thats the point that divides opinionis though. Some say it's the team's fault as he doesnt get good service, some say it's his poorm form. I tend to go with the 2nd option as he's hardly involved in the game (with or without service) and if he has the ball, he doesnt produce much. Would be interested to see how we play with RvP on the bench

2258~~~
I think dropping him right now will be best for everyone, I am not sure if it's just me but there are multiple times every game where he makes good runs but the other players just choose another pass. He isn't getting involved enough and thus whenever he gets the ball he tends to take too much time on it and not pass it to others. It's sad though that whatever be the reason we are just not scoring enough goals from inside the box.

2259~~~
Definitely not finished but in poor form. 

I would like to see a front three that are able to counter attack and interchange. RVP doest provide this and he can let the game pass him by.

In an ideal world he would make an excellent late game sub. He would  be a game changer. Hopefully LVG realizes this.

2260~~~
Fact Wilson didnt start for reserves potentially he may get a start

2261~~~
It would be a good game to bed him in, certainly. His pace could be such an asset.

2262~~~
Are you serious? Has he ever played that role? It seems mental to me, don't know how would that improve us. 

Well, I think him slowing up the play almost every time he gets the ball is the reason why players around him tend to choose another pass, not the other way around. He

I actually think he falls in the same category as Carrick last year - he is asked to do too much, considering his fitness/energy level/physicality as general. That might not be the only factor but in my opinion it’s the main one. A longer break would be very good for him I reckon.

2263~~~
I think he would create more if he had Falcao next to him making runs he's familiar with being a striker.

2264~~~
His best season here came with Ferguson and his wing play. It's what he likes feeding off, not just from crosses but from the space created by them attacking wide. 

We're not attacking like that this season and he's struggling to feed off anything. He can't support during counter attacks and doesn't have the pace to create time and spade from through balls. He just looks lost. 

Even last year with Moyes' tactics it played to his strengths and his return was good.

2265~~~
His best PL season ever was arguably the previous one with Arsenal, who barely used wingers at all.

I don't think the tactics can be blamed for his decline.

2266~~~
He plays well with Falcao but I don't think we should play 3 attackers which would mean dropping Rooney, which is very unlikely as he's the captain and has scored a few. Maybe he does need to be dropped for a few games to get his mojo back because to me he is world class, he's having a dip in form. At the same time I wouldn't entirely blame him, I don't the team has played that well yet, we still have a few more levels to pick up.

2267~~~
Perhaps I do underestimate him, but he's playing below his high standards and that's just not good enough.

Often he looks disinterested, that's something I though would pass along with Moyes sacking, but even under LVG he seems unhappy eventhough his position in the starting eleven is out of question.

His body language speaks of someone tired, jaded and someone who's playing within his true ability.

Don't think he was that good against Chelsea, and if you think he's overall contribution to the team this season was good enough that speaks for itself how he's fallen from the player we all knew.

Really hope he regains his mojo but don't think he will- wrong side of the 30's, had his share of injuries, there are younger, better players around the corner and team doesn't depend on him like it used to.

Will always be grateful for that first season with United, but it's been 2 years since then and he's only getting worse, shame that since in his prime there were just few better than him!

2268~~~
If you look back at our last few games we have hardly created any chances, until we get a well balanced midfield and defence I think it is going to be tough going for whoever plays up front, I don’t think Falcao would have fared any better. 

The Arsenal game was poor for him but he isn’t the type of centre forward you can leave up front without any decent service, someone like Aguero or Costa can still be a handful and give you an out ball in behind because of their pace but RVP can’t. 

We are very pedestrian and easy to defend against and that problem is much bigger than just RVP, we either need to find a way to start getting him involved in the game or leave him out, push Rooney further forward and bring in Mata or Herrera to try and improve our creativity.

2269~~~
Agree with this, there's not enough movement around the box, or direct passes towards box but that doesn't justify his weak aproach to the matches.

He doesn't work hard enough, there was moment in the Arsenal match where he was jogging back between their centarbacks just for the sake of it, not like he was actually trying to put pressure on them.

Falcao showed much more iniative than RVP when played up front, hope RVP gets dropped and that kicks some fighting spirit in him!

2271~~~
Of course you are rude. I am free to state my opinions and your abuse is clearly in contravention with the rules of the forum. I have never said Rooney forced Nani out of United and have never said anything about Rooney that is as a rude as what you said about RVP, " He's like a Grandpa among men........ 65y not 31". I am impressed by Nani's skill level and I think RVP is unfairly criticised while rooney is over-rated but I do not go around abusing those who differ in their opinion.

2272~~~
He's an intelligent man, hopefully he gets back into form soon. Really miss him at his best.

Mancini lines up Van Persie swoop

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11259459/Mancini-lines-up-Van-Persie-swoop.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...259459/Mancini-lines-up-Van-Persie-swoop.html</a>

2274~~~
Really good interview, very intelligent man. He'll become a manager I reckon.

2275~~~
Give him Xmas off. Let him chill in Holland and put his feet up. We will need him for the top 4 push as Falcao can't be relied on and Rooney being deployed in midfield.

2276~~~
He's just so isolated up front that it doesn't make sense to play him in those tight games against the good teams with the deep manner the team us set up.

A more physical, faster striker with good hold up and link-up play would be the best option. A certain player we've let go off comes to mind but let's not derail the thread.

There is a certain amount of merit to both the 'He doesn't have enough service and players around him, and the 'he isn't working hard enough, is too laboured and anonymous' statements.

First of all he is a striker with intelligent movement, deft footwork in tight spaces and great technique overall who never really relied on his athleticism. A technical and an intelligent player who in theory should be able to perform at a good level in his early thirties. He has deteriorated when it comes to his pace and his strength. However, I don't think it is as marked that his performances seem to suggest right now and he was never heavily reliant on these traits anyway.

His individual performances in isolation without taking servive into consideration has been disappointing to say the least. His dribbling seems extremely contrived and he doesn't seem to be making the right decisions on the ball. I can think of a few instances in the Arsenal game in which he was largely at fault. The offside pass to Di Maria after dallying on the ball on a promising break comes to mind. Moreover he got jostled off the ball by feckin Arteta in a pathetic attempt to hold up the ball and made an equally desperate attempt to dribble past him and miserably fail. It really points to a mental rut or just a case of him off color. He looks dejected at times even...

He has been in poor form and is responsible for it. However, the way in which we've set up in recent matches (with Rooney and Fellaini in midfield) isn't helping him as well. If you leave him isolated without a great long passer in the team or players to dovetail with, you can't expect too much from him. The best you can hope for is a jammy goal from him and a fairly anonymous performance.

The RVP of 2 years ago would have done a great job spearheading an attack isolated. I remember a good portion of his Arsenal goals coming in that manner esp the Song overhead passes for RVP to volley etc. Right now it would make more sense for LVG to use Falcao or heck even Wilson when we play an isolated lone striker. Really hope Falcao starts against Hull or RVP plays in a team with Herrera in midfield and Rooney playing off him instead of being in midfield. Esp in a game against Hull.

2277~~~
Just watched RVPs goals in fergies last season in charge on mutv . 
If only we had the same player now .
He scored some great goals .
The city free kick and villa goals were fantastic .
I hope he can hit those heights again . I'm not sure if he's sorely to blame or the team he's in is playing a part but he doesn't look the same player this season .

2278~~~
Thought I'd bring this here as it shouldn't be in the herrera thread...
That's your opinion. Rooney scored 34 goals in 11/12, led us to 2nd place, level on points with City (19 points ahead of Arsenal). Look at our team that season. In 12/13 I agree, RvP was our best player. Rooney was far from his best then though. Rooney at his best, in 11/12 or 09/10, scored 34 goals both seasons. In fact, Van Persie only had that period, 2011/12 and 12/13 where he was truly world class, at least goal scoring wise (37 goals and 30 goals). Was there anything between them during that period? Not really in my opinion, both absolutely world class, like Falcao was, but neither really the best striker in the world. In 2009/10 Rooney had a shout for that, in 11/12 RvP had a shout for that, but both those years you could say Falcao or Ibrahimovic were the best strikers in the world. Falcao scored 34 goals, 38 goals, 36 goals and 34 goals for the 4 seasons between 2009/10 and 2012/13. For pure consistency at keeping that level for longer, I'd have both Falcao and Ibra as better strikers at their best then RvP or Rooney were at their best.

Not a lot in it, but it's so far from the truth to say that Van Persie is easily better then Rooney or Falcao, now, or ever really. Now especially he's declined quite a bit that he really shouldn't be starting anymore, especially given our options.

2279~~~
Everybody is saying he has declined but I don't think we can honestly say that until we see more of the season, last year under Moyes despite his injuries he was more prolific than under Ferguson and I highly doubt that was down to David Moyes.

It is possible he is low on confidence and this is affecting his game, with Falcao looking like returning and Wilson also Rooney can play up top, Louis van Gaal has players to take the pressure off of him if need be.

2280~~~
Unfortunately too many football fans are fickle and short-sighted. Robin is in a patch of bad form at the moment, there is no arguing that. He's a fantastic goalscorer and should be given more support to turn it around. I seen him play at Palace a few weeks ago, he's rusty. It's a matter of service as well. We have not been creating enough chances from the wings. I think we need a fit Shaw, Rafael and an inform Di Maria to create more. RVP is not an all-round player forward like Rooney. RVP is a striker that needs service. His record at United since he came is very good. He was influential in us winning our 20th title and has turned up in the big games overall. Even when he's playing poorly, he can still score a last minute equalizer against Chelsea. He's a top player and isn't finished, let's all stop the negativity. We had enough of that under Moyes last year. I think he'll turn it around, we were so dependent on him at one time. Now that we have other options people don't care if we get rid, sad times . Robin Van Persie has given us a lot of great memories in such a short time, prove them haters wrong RVP<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2281~~~
Hopefully Van Gaal's tactic of subbing him off for a teenager, then publicly calling him out will light a fire under him.

2282~~~
Hopefully he is benched for the Hull game.

2283~~~
Will be interesting to see if he starts and what role he will play if Falcao is on the bench too. With LvG saying he had a "very bad game" and that he is low on confidence I'm not sure he'll start. Big chance for Wilson if that is the case.

2284~~~
I think he will start RvP to get his confidence back. This time he knows that Wilson and Falcao are waiting in the wings and will replace him if he's off again.

2285~~~
That hasn't been working the last few weeks. But I guess the opposition is easier this time so there is that.

2286~~~
I think you're spot on there. 

I think against Hull he might well play Rooney behind two strikers, most likely Wilson and Van Persie although I think he's more likely to start Van Persie up front behind Rooney with both Wilson and Falcao on the bench serving as a huge warning to him that he will be hauled off at half time if he's not cutting the mustard.

2287~~~
Glad LVG has called him out on this. He knows RVP's abilities and he is clearly not playing to them. 

I hope he is dropped against Hull and we play Rooney up top with Mata, Herrera, Di Maria and Carrick in midfield.

2288~~~
I guess RvP has been doing a lot of voodoo magic lately, keeping Falcao injured and now dealing with Wilson it seems. He’s one lucky man to be in that team.

2289~~~
Wow. He starts again. He'll probably score a goal, be rubbish all game and then start the next 10 matches. Would have loved to see Herrera and Mata both play with Rooney alone up top.

2290~~~
Hope this is his last chance, we cant afford it for him to feck up more matches and chances.

2291~~~
Getting to the point where it's not fair on the rest of the squad, especially when you have the likes of Herrera and Mata on the bench most weeks.

2292~~~
RVP's movement has been so stagnant he can't even be moved from the starting 11.

2293~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I agree though. But if Wilson is ill/injured and Falcao is not able to play a full match yet, what options are there besides Rooney?

2294~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2295~~~
Why do we talk about Rooney as if he's a poor option to start up top? He's one of the best strikers in the league!

Rooney up top, Mata number 10, ADM, Herrera and Carrick midfield would be great to see.

2296~~~
Question is, do we need more options up top beside Rooney? What’s the point in playing 2 strikers (or 3 if Mata decides to play as high as usual) if you can’t create chances for them? I’m not sure why are we sticking with playing 2 strikers.

2297~~~
Im hoping LVGs comments will spur him in today. I think he probably realises a bad game today will spell a time on the sidelines once Falcao is back to fitness

2298~~~
Seems very eager to be tackled.

2299~~~
I feel for van persie because he's trying really hard and it's not really working out for him, clearly confidence is an issue here and only goals will make it better.

2300~~~
Hasn't played well but you can see he's looking to make an impact. Still if he doesn't drastically improve in the second half, it's time for the bench.

2301~~~
Oh Robin <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2302~~~
I think he's finished as a big player at club level tbh.. just doesn't have that dynamism to lead week in week out. He'll have good performances here and there, but the old RVP is gone.

2303~~~
I asked in the match day thread but I'll ask here again. Has he being fully Torres'd or is this just a blip? A very long blip?

2304~~~
There is an air of desperation about his play today, he'll get an assist though for Rooney's goal, however apart from that he has struggled once again and has been left behind at times when we move the ball quickly between Mata, Herrera and Rooney.

2305~~~
He's fading fast, sadly. Needs to rediscover some form sooner rather than later.

2306~~~
Falcao on asap plz.

2307~~~
Would seem like a kneejerk, but somehow i fear that you are right. He just seems so labored these days and seems to have lost that keen edge that made him great. Hope he gets subbed for Falcao at HT

2308~~~
Nothing we already didn't know is it. He's 31, has lost form and isn't likely to return to the Rvp of 2-3 years ago. This match is a pivot point in his career at OT.

2309~~~
Thing is he actually looks lean and fit, that is what makes me so concerned. He looks like he's at full pelt and is putting in performances like that.

2310~~~
Trying too hard. You can see he's lacking in confidence.

2311~~~
...aaaaaaaaaaand he's back !

2312~~~
Get in there, Robin. Glad he scored.

2313~~~
Delighted for him, great goal

2314~~~
Happy for him.

Assist and a Goal

Well done Robin!

2325~~~
Someone needs to make a side by side comparison with the Swansea goal from last season. Both sublime strikes.

2326~~~
Bit slow and sloppy early on but improved in the second half with that header which required a great save albeit from 0.0001mm offside and then a fantastic goal.

2327~~~
That goal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> By the time you try and think what he's going to do, the ball in the top corner. Love it

2328~~~
I think he was not very good today but the goal was brilliant. Lost the ball countless times and was mostly invisible

2329~~~
Then he goes and does that?! Football eh? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2330~~~
Thats the type of goal he can produce. Out of nothing, bang.

2331~~~
Not the best performance but that goal was class.

2332~~~
Average overall but spectacular finish. It's the sort of power he's been missing in his finishes all season.

2333~~~
Started off a bit shit, turned it around. Lets hope he stays on form going forward.

2334~~~
Got a lot more involved in the game. And though clearly not at his best yet, it was a huge step up from his recent performances. Now it would be a lot harder for me to whine if he starts the next game. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

2336~~~
He looked very strong in the second half. Destroyed Dawson with his movement and power.

2337~~~
Good performance and really needed that goal. Hope he keeps it up.

2338~~~
Terrible first half hour, was clearly trying too hard and felt under some pressure but towards the end of the half and before he came off was much better. Amazing finish, not many players can do that.

2339~~~
To be fair, he was lucky to've stayed on long enough to get the goal.

Hopefully that won't mean he's bought himself another month of automatic starts regardless of form.

2340~~~
Loved his goal, but other than that he was poor again.

2341~~~
We will look back on this thread like we do on the Rooney thread, when people were glad to see him suspended. His form will recover sooner or later and he'll start banging them in (like he did today) on a regular basis again.

2342~~~
Good movement and with Carrick back in the team we finally have someone looking for those longer balls Van Persie likes in behind. He was close a few times and scored a great goal

2343~~~
Slow and sloppy start, but improved as the game went on. Great finish for the goal.

2344~~~
I disagree. Our midfield was great today and Hull were shocking from front to back and yet still he looked poor for most of the game - lost the ball a lot, tackled regularly and easily, caught offside regularly, was through on goal and tapped it at the keeper with his right.

It was a goal against a poor side who'd accepted defeat, and the goal was the anomaly, not his performance.

I think at the highest level RvP is done as a world class forward - this 'slump in form' has gone on for over a year for goodness' sake!

I'd like to see him eased out of the starting line up and moved on in the summer. His wages are too high to have him as a 'super-sub'.

2345~~~
It was a great strike but I remain of the view his overall game has deteriorated and the Rooney/Mata/Herrera trio could have used a much more mobile and quick #9 to play off. Maybe he will be happy to become the new Teddy, but for me we should be moving towards giving Falcao a genuine run as the #9.

2346~~~
That goal better have given him a kick up the arse (like the penalty he scored against Stoke after a 10 game streak of 0 goals). He really needs to work on staying onside too.

That flying header though <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>, he's clearly capable of some fantastic goals but his all round play needs serious improvement.

2347~~~
Yep, he got better as the game went on, looked to have a bit of pace back when he ran in behind and away from defenders a couple of times too. Hopefully the goal and assist sorts his confidence out.

2348~~~
I said to friends during the game that he was trying too hard to do something with the ball. He's definitely over thinking his game. The moment he started keeping things simple his performance improved greatly.

2349~~~
Glad he got a goal. As much as he's been really off the pace and I'm not sure he'll find his best form, it's always a positive that he still does get goals every so often. At least managing to offer something to us.

2350~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> what a beauty! Class is permanent indeed. Also, I thought he had a good game overall, was positively involved in attacks, and teed up Wayne nicely for his goal. I've never minded waiting for RVP to catch form, it's the least he deserves. People must not forget that an inform RVP is simple an unstoppable beast, an all-rounded striker with a killer instinct but who also regularly creates for others and can dribble with the best of them.

2351~~~
Wasn't great but what a finish and definitely a clear improvement on last week. Done more than enough to start on Tuesday.

2352~~~
Awesome goal, to be fair to the guy. Well in.

2353~~~
The reason I don't think he's "past it" is because his first touch has also suffered. That doesn't have much to do with your physicality; it's more of a mental thing and this goal I'm pretty sure will get him past that.

2354~~~
Not sure if we're ever going to see a return to the RvP of two years ago, but he's shown why he's worth keeping. I think the key now is finding out how to utilise him best within the squad - once we find a proper solution I think he'll be a real asset, but I don't think that solution should be a guaranteed starter. But with Van Gaal likely to use him as one for the foreseeable future, he has plenty of opportunities to prove me wrong.

2355~~~
The power he can generate is incredible. Surely must be one of the most powerful strikers of the ball in the world.

2356~~~
Thought he was very good today, one of his best performances of the season. 

Anyone notice how deep he was playing at the beginning of the match? He was playing more as a CF or even CAM while Rooney was up top with Di Maria as a left forward almost. It's hard to explain but he was coming extremely deep and his movement was exceptional today, moreso than all the other games this season. His touch was off and heavy in the first half, but was soon involved with a lot of our attacks. 

He was unlucky to miss his glorious World Cup 2.0 header but ended with an assist and a goal. Great game by him, I don't care what others say. And until Falcao can show me otherwise, I have RVP as my first striker every day of the week.

2357~~~
Hopefully the goal doesn't mask his performance, which was pretty average again. It was a beautiful goal though, which should gives him confidence. Onwards and upwards from here Robin!

2358~~~
So happy he got that. It's been hanging over him and affecting his whole game. At least he was a lot more involved today. He still needs to sharpen up his ball retention. Too often he's losing it easily or not beating players with the ball skills we know he has. But it's a step in the right direction.

2359~~~
Before the goal it was the worst performance he's had this season. Hopefully he'll take confidence from and kickstart his season.

2360~~~
start van persie next game then? <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

2361~~~
Goal and an assist in a 3-0 win - fail to see any reason for criticism. Pleased for RvP, because rumours of his demise are way overstated. Seems a player can't just be plain out of form anymore without being sent to the scrapyard.

2362~~~
Watching the game again he was really poor apart from the 10 minutes or so before his goal. I don't think it should buy him another extended run in the side if he continues to perform badly now Falcao is back, his overall performance needs to improve a lot in the next game.

2363~~~
I was at he game and watched RVP the service was not great to him around the box. He even had to drop deep at times just to get a touch, he made plenty of runs of the ball. Looked a little low in confidence but hopefully his goal helps that front. Seemed to run out of steam a little at the end and then Falcao came on. Wouldn't be unhappy with his performance at all yesterday.

2364~~~
He started in a deeper role so I'd say that was intentional.

2365~~~
If class is permanent then why isn't Bobby Charlton still in the team?

2366~~~
I'm pleased for him, he's not in decline at all. The World Cup was only four or five months ago and he was one of the best players at the tournament, you don't go to turning crap so quickly after that.

2367~~~
He scored a great goal but he was pretty average throughout the tournament. He has been in bad form pretty much since last season, but yesterday was a sign of better things to come.

2368~~~
He's retired mate.

2369~~~
Can anyone post his stats from the game yesterday, it felt like the number of times he lost possession was approaching double digits.

2370~~~
By deep I was meaning into the midfield and he certainly didn't start in midfield.

2371~~~
Comparing a 31 year old man to someone in their 70's probably isn't the way to point out any flaws in a statement.

2372~~~
Because he'd to old <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> grow up feck face lol

2373~~~
I noticed this too. I wouldn't start him against Stoke but it looks like we're working Falcao back up to fitness and I'm not sure if Wilson is even fit.

2374~~~
Spain game aside, I thought he was shite in the World Cup. Definitely not one of the better players or something like that. And of course he's in decline, he's 31 years old and had all his injury problems. Anyone at that point in their career would be in decline. He's been in a steady decline ever since January 2013 pretty much, though was still class until fergie retired and a bit into moyes' reign. Just nowhere near his 11/12 form. This past year has been poor though, if you want to call it a poor run of form go ahead, but I think it's just more likely due to age and his injury problems taking its toll.

2375~~~
I saw him in a testimonial in the 80's (can't remember whose - I think it was against the 1977 cup winners) and he scored a belter. He'd have been in his late forties, I reckon

2376~~~
It looked like we started with van Persie playing behind Rooney and Di Maria. Once Di Maria pulled up, he went back upfront and Mata went into the #10 role.

2377~~~
Thought he was pretty average other than the goal and its just masked another average performance. I'd love to see a fully fit Falcao upfront instead of him.

2378~~~
I know he got the goal and assist but he wasn't great yesterday. Very average I would say, lost the ball too many times. But I'm hoping the goal will give him confidence so I would still start him against Stoke.

2379~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2380~~~
He's in decline because he's 31? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Ibrahimovic right now is playing the best he's ever played and he's 33, Zidane was sublime at 30-33 years of age as well, and many more players. Van Persie was injured a lot when he was younger, so he still should have plenty left in the tank, you act like his game relies heavily on pace when it clearly doesn't. Also the bit about him declining from January 2013, where exactly did you get this precise date from lol?

He definitely needs to start scoring some goals now, I'm talking braces and maybe some hat-ricks, until his goal record goes completely sour then I refuse to believe he's in a steady decline, and it most definitely isn't because of his age which isn't even that old by the way.

2381~~~
If anything, the injuries will mean his decline will come sooner... They don't prolong careers just because they didn't play. Ibra was never really injury prone and is a different beast altogether to rvp. He is a tank physically so he can boss defences around even at his age.

And I've used my eyes really. He was absolutely world class between 11-12, but since the start of 2013 he wasn't quite as good and has steadily gotten worse or more invisible in games. Last season he had a good scoring record but there's no doubt that has impact on games was greatly reduced, which means he declined, by the very definition of the word, no? This season has been even worse. He's just followed the standard timeline for a steady decline really, taking into account his age and his overall performances. Not all about the goals, and they covered up his ineffective performances last season.

If anyone thinks Van Persie hasn't declined since his level 3 years ago when he was in his prime, then you must have thought he was a pretty shite player basically, because for the most part this season he's been shite.

2382~~~
Seemed like it's just his first touch that's deserted him, still making excellent runs and still capable of those sublime finishes, not many forwards can generate that power with very little back lift. 
He's missed Carrick in my opinion, start him next game and see if Carrick can pick out those runs just like he did for the header.

2383~~~
Agreed. But not this shite.

2384~~~
I suspect he is in decline but he's still a world class striker. Foolish to write a guy off with such skill on the ball and powerful finishing.

2385~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B3tndgPIMAADLjt.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B3tndgPIMAADLjt.jpg"/> 

The Flying Header is becoming a bit of a trademark for him <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

2386~~~
He's brilliant. Has a few not so great games and he's in decline. 

Knee jerk reaction on the caf? Never.

2387~~~
Its not so knee jerk if you compare his performances last year from those the two before that, and with the fact that you're looking at a 31 year old player. Everyone's happy for him and his goal but that doesn't change the inevitable.

2388~~~
I can see RvP being able to play at a high level until say 35/36 assuming he doesn't get a nasty injury.

He's never been reliant on pace.

2389~~~
That's true, although his injury history doesn't support that as very likely. Nor would it make sense for us to use a 34/35 year old striker when strikers are typically at their best in their mid 20s.

2390~~~
Carrick and Herrera seemed to be making a big effort to play him in the way he likes, which was nice. I was just glad he got the goal. He definitely needed it. Probably won't play Tuesday night anyway given how soon it is

2391~~~
If Fellaini, Mata, Valencia, Young etc. lost possession as much as Van Persie did yesterday they would get so much abuse, he fortunately has an amazing goal to distract from that but he still as a lot to improve on.

2392~~~
Van Persie made 19/20 passes. 95%.

2393~~~
Yeah, Van Persie has been immune from criticism here all season.

2394~~~
Get on a players back and sooner or later the good ones will answer the criticism.

RVP is a quality player so it was inevitable.

But the current tread is for every forward player to be playmaker so the likes of RVP or Benzema will always appear less busy than a Messi or Aguero type.

2395~~~
Carrick playing is a big plus for RVP, he's naturally in tune with the runs he makes.

2396~~~
I think he enjoys having Carrick in the team and at his passing best. Although I thought RvP was still poor in possession his runs were spotted more because of Carrick's superb vision (like that offside diving header). So with Carrick back playing I would expect RvP to get more chances to score, he just has to sharpen up his all round play which is the real issue for me.

2397~~~
That's true. I was getting annoyed by him constantly losing the ball, especially when he should have made a pass to Rooney but instead tried to get past 3 Hull players

2398~~~
That's nice but there are more ways to lose possession than misplacing a pass. Just watch the game again, he gave away the ball several times.

2399~~~
I think The Neviller said it best in his analysis - that it's not RvP who has declined massively, but that we lacked players who could spot his run off the shoulders of the defenders:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ewFBzMk-w3Y?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

The return of Carrick & Herrera to the 1st team in the last match just highlights this point.

2400~~~
Just needs a break.

2401~~~
So you're comparing how many times a striker loses the ball with defenders and midfielders? I'd be worried if he was playing it safe and not risking things in the final quarter.

He isn't quite right just yet but you're being overly harsh.

2402~~~
It was a really good goal but that shot which hit the post against WBA was 6 inches away from being a really good goal, yet had no impact on his overall performance during or after that game. At the end of the day he's a seriously talented footballer so will be capable of smacking in wonder goals when the ball drops right for a good few years yet. Certainly long past his retirement.

Does the goal herald a return to form? I'm not so sure. His overall performance was fairly mixed. Did seem a lot more involved, which is good. So maybe we'll see more from him in the next few games. I certainly hope so.

2403~~~
That's because he's a goalscorer, scoring goals will improve his confidence, not hiitting a good shot that nearly goes in.

2404~~~
That's all very well but do you think the only issue this season is a lack of confidence? I'm not so sure.

EDIT: Although, thinking about it, the Dutch do have a reputation for being temperamental. It's possible that his lack of confidence in front of goal messed with his head so much that he stopped putting the effort in. Which would have been my major issue with his performances so far this season.

2405~~~
RvP will fair much better with Herrera, Mata, Carrick in the team. Players that actually look for his clever runs off the final man and have the technical ability to feed him the passes that he requires to be deadly. You do not lose your quality over-night. He is a proven world-class striker.

2406~~~
His overall performance was terrible. He's had much better performances this season that haven't resulted in a goal. It was a Rooney-esque performance when he's having a bad day but as you say he was more involved which is cause for optomism.

2407~~~
We need one of our strikers to really hit them goals consistently.

2408~~~
Yea I have thought that myself, I'm just hoping it has to do with confidence and that goal helped, He seemed like it was a weight off his shoulders when he scored.

2409~~~
RVP has been lacking good service, that's all. He lives off great service and through balls. In a way, Di Maria's injury will help him. Herrera's service is top notch. With him and Carrick in the middle, RVP will get goals.

2410~~~
It wasn't terrible. Against Arsenal it was terrible, he just wasn't involved. 

He had a quiet first half against Hull too, but markedly improved in the second half and nearly scored a wonderful header. He does tend to stray offside too much for my liking. Not sure whether it's the timing of his runs or our midfielders not playing the right ball at the right time though.

2411~~~
Agreed - he had at least 2 other great chances besides his goal, one from Carrick (the offside header) and one from Herrera (the weak right footed shot from the top of the box).

He's still nowhere near top form but it's a step in the right direction, for him and the team around him

2412~~~
I think that's a little generous to him. You could argue that he's not been providing the movement to make that service possible. His lack of work-rate and energy has been truly awful at times. If he doesn't make runs and find space, he won't get good service. He did a better job of that against Hull and received the ball in better positions as a consequence.

Anyway, either way things look to be improving finally.

2413~~~
He has been consistently making his little clever runs in and around the box, he's not one to make glaringly obvious runs that can be seen from miles away. That's what makes him deadly, and is also why he should have no problem maintaining his level well into his thirties. It's very important to have a midfield that's on his wavelength, with guys who can spot his runs and are good enough to pull off the passes. Otherwise you're asking too much from RVP, where he drops back into midfield to help create the chances he should be finishing. Mind you he's good at doing that, but we all know he's best at finishing.

2414~~~
Poor decision. Should have passed it to Wilson.

2415~~~
Just took too long to get the ball under control and look up. By then the ball he played was the only option. Hererra still should have scored, mind you.

2416~~~
Its like he didn't have confidence Wilson could put it away.

2417~~~
Well that would be fecking ridiculous, if so.

2418~~~
Was hoping for a conspiracy theory when I saw this thread was bumped, disappointed.

2419~~~
Nah he wanted to shift it to his left.


His play has become so slow and ponderous these days. He slows down every ball he receives and then ends up just passing wide.


Wilson made a good run once inside and he just passed it wide to young and after shimmying.

2420~~~
Looked good so far, we need to involve him more, he is the key to us winning this game.

2421~~~
He fecking refuses to link up with someone.

When he gets the ball he slows everything down and then just passes it wide.


Was better 2nd half but meh should be dropped. Something has gone wrong with him.

2422~~~
Dropped for who? If we go 2 up top, he's currently our 2nd best. Wilson is lightweight and not ready, Falcao is not fully fit.

2423~~~
He worked his arse off. I think physically he looked as good as he's ever been. The service is pretty weak and really Wilson should have set him up when he took it on his own.

He played very well imo.

2424~~~
Still needs dropping. An abundance of outrageously thick fouls, too.

2425~~~
Knew people would mention him not passing to Wilson, could have been quicker but if Herrera scores doubt many would be talking about it. In fact, such is the Caf that if Wilson had missed then people might even had said 'Ander was free'. Thought he was alright today actually all things considered, some good touches and the service to him was awful at times in that game.

2426~~~
I find it amazing that people see him becoming some Bergkamp-esque, walking link-up player, when he's just not inclined to link up like that at all. 
He's 100% a solo striker. The problem is that he's a solo striker who slows things down to a snail's pace.

Wilson and Rooney up top would be worth a try, I reckon.

2427~~~
Not his best game, but not his worst either. Still seems blocked in a way, if that makes sense?

2428~~~
Wilson pretty much outperformed him today as well. Atleast he offers something different works hard as well and is mobile.

Dunno what RVP offers even these days. When team sits back he seems to slow things down and take some poor touches or get pushed off and not press. When game is open he is pretty immobile to counter.


And anyway Falcao should be fit now. How long can he stay not fully fit ?

2429~~~
Its cnuts like you that are the problem. Can't even hold a player to high standards when you think that was a very good performance. He did next to nothing.

2430~~~
One of his best games this season.

2431~~~
Moments of absolute control of the ball but still not his usual best.

On the other hand some passes to him were abysmal today.

2432~~~
Meh. Worked hard but didn't really do much in the end. Wilson was better of the two I thought, which isn't a good sign for rvp with falcao coming back as well and rooney being obviously first choice.

2433~~~
Offers much better hold up play, makes good runs, better finisher... Wilson isn't ready to start games. He looks like a reserve player at the moment. Van Persie still has a lot to offer, and he worked his arse off today too.

2434~~~
Btw, his offside before that clearance by Young and 2nd stoke great chance was so stupid.

He was in so much space and clean through if he kept in line.

2435~~~
Should've passed to Wilson.

2436~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px">There was a moment where we had a free-kick in a decent area and he tried to take a quick pass to Hererra (which was on, to be fair) but Herrera gave him a "cool it" arm gesture, to say we should take our time with the set-piece but Van Persie ignored him and took a quick pass to Young, who wasn't expecting it at all. Just seemed like pointless stroppiness. He's not enjoying his football, that's for sure.</span>

2437~~~
I agree

2438~~~
Wilson worked much harder from first half. He pressed their defenders and also tracked back on both flanks so many times.

His finishing is meh these days. Don't think he'll be better than Wilson at it.

Strength and Hold up play is better but it's too slow after that and he refuses to link up or even be direct. One or two shimmy's and it goes way back or wide. His movement to be fed is slow too.

2439~~~
RVP hasn't been great, but also, we aren't giving any service to our strikers, at the same time team isn't putting everything for the forwards, but making chances for everyone I guess, as we've gotten alot of goals from midfield

2440~~~
You mean the free kick that he won by working hard and tracking back? He's obviously trying very hard, and isn't getting much good service. Right at the end, he was in an absolute acre of space and had a free run on goal but Valencia took forever to notice.

2441~~~
He had feck all service tonight and he did the best he could in the circumstances. I'm sure he felt like strangling Wilson.

2442~~~
There was points when he looked deflated but he makes so many runs that don't get noticed by our midfield (both wide and central). It's not good but I don't blame him at times. Thought he worked really hard also.

2443~~~
He pressed their defense well, set up two chances for Mata and Herrera, chased back to win the ball for the team everytime one of our midfielders was caught upfield. Its these small things that people don't really notice but were vital to team on the day. Like i said he looked very fit today and never stopped running.

2444~~~
Think he was quite peed off at the lack of service. Had he received passes he'd of probably scored tonight. The Wilson one for example, although Wilson was very close to scoring himself.

2445~~~
He did work his ass off today but so did Wilson.There are not much services for both of them and if I have to start one of the two I will start Wilson with his pace.

That saying I don't think he was bad today.Slow down our attack couple of times but that's expected from a striker of his age.

2446~~~
Was pleased with his defensive work rate

2447~~~
Another lacklustre performance.

2448~~~
I think he would have scored a goal tonight if Rooney and Di Maria were playing. His movement looked much better but he had no real creativity behind him.

2449~~~
Regardless, I do think Wilson had the best chance there. Persie didn't look very dangerous for the most part, not his worst performance though.
it seems he always try to do everything by himself and cannot link up well with other strikers( well, not just him it's our strikers' problem actually). Something is wrong with him.

2450~~~
Wilson's pace means nothing when he doesn't know how to use his body to shield the ball and play as a target man against big rough defenders. He is far too lightweight to lead the line for us if Rooney's to be the one to drop deep. He's not transferred any of the reserve form to the first team yet. Promising and I like the look of him, but not enough to start over RVP.

2451~~~
I thought he did a little better than Saturday despite not scoring. I was surprised he didn't take that chance on himself when he passed to Herrera as it was on his left foot. Still miles off his best.

2452~~~
I'm amazed he's still in the team; if only because we don't know whether we'd be better or worse without him and we aren't that good with him in the team. Surely we have to take a serious look at other options at some point in the season ?

2453~~~
Wilson got the revenge by not passing the ball to RvP who would have scored that chance.

2454~~~
Pretty meh, again. I don't think his season will kick start, ever.

2455~~~
I thought he worked hard off the ball to get into positions. At times the play seemed to just go in the opposite direction to where he was working.  He will come right.

2456~~~
He wasn't good, but then none of our forwards got much of a sniff tonight. The midfield reverted to the old tried and t̶e̶s̶t̶e̶d̶ consistently useless "pass it out to the wings and back off" tactic of the last 2-3 years.

Disappointing, but I'd fall short of actively blaming either of them.

2457~~~
Should have passed to Wilson when their 'keeper gifted him the ball.

But he didn't see enough of the ball, so I wouldn't criticise him too harshly. He's someone who only needs one chance.

2458~~~
Worked really hard tonight off the ball tonight, which is nice to see. Goals will hopefully come soon. Not sure two up top suits Van Persie or Falcao, though. That said, he wasn't exactly pulling up any trees when we played one up top.

2459~~~
Usually I would be critical of his perfomance but I felt sorry for him today. No one wanted to pass to him at all and the few times someone did, it was usually an overhit pass or it came several seconds after he had to stop his run. Other than that he worked really hard today, like he did against Hull. Atleast he got that back in his locker.

2460~~~
Give him a rest against Southampton please.

2461~~~
If Wilson had passed him the ball we'd be saying how RVP has 2 goals in 2 games and should start the next game.

He was unlucky today, he was making some good runs but no one wanted to pass to him and instead would rather pass it back or sideways. He must have been very frustrated.

2462~~~
Me neither. I think this is what he has become now, unfortunately for us LVG will give him more and more chances yet though.

2463~~~
Even if he did score at that chance, his overall play was still very minimal. We can't have him just coasting through games like he has been, not when we have Wilson, Rooney and even Falcao who will offer more in overall play.

2464~~~
People keep saying he's making loads of good runs. That's the second game in a row where we've had a shit-load of posession and had quality passers like Carrick, Hererra, Mata and Rooney (v Hull) spending a <b>lot</b> of time on the ball but I don't think he's been put through once. Makes me question just how good his movement really is.

2465~~~
I really see nothing good coming out of playing him every game, there is a genuine chance of him having a fight with one of his teammates on the pitch very soon. Looked really frustrated today and gave away a rather silly free kick and also took a really quick one when no one was near him

2466~~~
It should be noted that the "loads of good runs" RVP make have been suggested to be clever little runs that are not so obvious. Personally, I have not seen those runs since they are not obvious. I'll venture a guess that our quality passers (actual professional footballers) don't find his clever little runs obvious either.

2467~~~
Well if you expect Wilson to be some sort of target man I think you'll be largely disappointed.Agree that he still have a lot to improve on this performance.

2468~~~
Happy with his performance because atleast he looked like he gave a damn today. Worked his socks off and did a lot of hard work. He should have squared it to Wilson and Wilson should have passed it to him.

2469~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

To be fair RVP to Wilson was understandable because Herrera was in an open position where the pass would have made it guaranteed and Herrera should have scored, to pass to Wilson there was still the small chance of the defender cutting it out and it would have to be quicker, with the space he had I think he did the right thing taking his time and setting Herrera up.

As for Wilson I think he should have passed it, he took the more difficult route by taking it on himself.

2470~~~
He had a good game in terms of team effort and runs, it does however feel like i am describing a Danny Welbeck performance other than RVP's, Although it is worth noting that the service to our strikers isn't that great at times, other than i don't see RVP doing much for us as a striker ... he might score occasionally and we might try to convince ourselves that "he is back" but who are we kidding?

2471~~~
His touch and pass to Herrera in the first half was vintage RVP. Didn't do much otherwise though but he's putting in the effort at least. Doesn't deserved to be dropped for Falcao or Wilson from today.

2472~~~
I thought he did alright, nothing special but the service wasn't great. There were a also few instances where he was in space and wasn't passed to.

2473~~~
Welback's been better than him all season.

2474~~~
Rooney was injured, Falcao lacking match fitness and Januzaj has fallen woefully short at senior level this season and last played up front in U21's. He played Wilson alongside RVP and some still want him dropped.

I thought he was good in the first half. His layoff to Herrera was the right move for the team and he should have registered an assist but for some poor finishing while Wilson should have laid him in for a sitter in the second half too (but after that run, and given we won in the end, it's easier to accept Wilson giving the shot a go, he earned the chance). His presence is also a huge impact on defenders too. It frees space for midfielders and runners to move into in front of the opposing centre backs as they're forced into a choice of marking him or coming forward, the exact situation that Wilson's run exploited.

If he plays badly, rinse him by all means but to satisfy some of you lot it seems you wanted RVP dropped at all costs no matter what impact it has or who is available. Crazy caf logic at times. Just assess the context first.

2475~~~
I think he has been so bad so far this season that now people are looking at even slightest bit of involvement as a positive. I just think he is a liability at the moment because he can't beat a man to save his life and isn't any good with his back to goal either. Van Persie is one United player almost every United fan likes so I just don't think people will rinse him just for the sake of it.

2476~~~
He's still not at his best, but The important thing is he's improving
on a game by game basis. Compared to Hull, his touch was miles better, his hold up play better and his work rate was far better than anything we've seen from him so far this season. 

I'd also like to point out how ridiculous it is that people are complaining about him not passing to Wilson. Herrera horribly screws up his shot and it's Van Persie's fault? Herrera should've scored or at least put that on target so blame him. Van Persie should be praised for creating a chance, not made the scapegoat for Herrera's awful attempt.

2477~~~
Had a very good game against Stoke. Looks like he's playing himself through a patch of bad (for him) form. Some lovely off-the-ball movement tonight had Stoke running round in circles at times.

2478~~~
Improving slightly but I think we need to accept he isn't a striker that will be getting 20+ goals a season anymore.

2479~~~
I thought I was blind seeing these comments. The only thing why people talking about him having a good game is that he wasn't absolutely awfull like he used to for us this season.. he was better bu still nothing special he was quite on par with Wilson. He is quite good when he covers the ball but still he pass it to CB most off the time even he is not pressed by defender. He as a senior palyer should do better sometimes. He extremely slows our play at times as his reactions to pick the right pass are very average. For the striker of his calibre I would expect something more.. He could pass to Wilson instead of Herrera in the first half. Anyway Ander should have killed it. One thing I Geess he is getting better is his fitness. Still lacks speed and a lot of stamina in his locker. I understand that it is a season after world cup but still sometimes I think its Anderson walking down the pitch wearing mask of RVP. Hopefully Falcao is back to full fitness ASAP. BUt my advice is to give even more time to Wilson. Today it was a tough game for him only opened at the end but still he is now on the big stage and needs to get used to players around him and they may use him little bit more..

2480~~~
He's not getting the service though, is he? I can't remember any attempts on goal from him tonight.

2481~~~
Is he playing anywhere near the level of the first-choice strikers at the best clubs in the league? Not even close. Which is a problem, no matter how much we look for positives after each game.

2482~~~
If Van Persie was a team (bare with me), he'd be in free-fall for the last year - occasionally picking up the odd win (goal) or draw (assist). But falling down the leagues consistently.

If you imagine a Premier League of world strikers - top 20 in the world - where would Van Persie be based on performances over the last year? That's a genuine question. When we bought him he would've been in the top 3, but based on the last year or so, where now? Top 10? Top 15? Would he even still be in the league...?

I personally feel we're approaching the point of living in the past when it comes to Van Persie. There are sporadic moments of brilliance (his header in the world cup, his strike against Hull) but they're few and far between. And most importantly, they don't merit being an automatic starter at Man Utd.

A lot of the time it feels as though we're playing with 10 men, or at most 10 and a half.

I understand that tonight Van Gaal had to play him, but as soon as Rooney's fit I'd really like to see Wayne up top and give RvP a few games coming off the bench - it's the best thing for the team AND for RvP at the moment.

2483~~~
Yup. You have to judge him by his own high standards and he's a shadow of the player he once was, in a season where he should really be our main man.

2484~~~
How do you mean the second game in a row and blabla? It was Carrick for that header and Herrera for his goal vs. Hull. Don't really see how his movement can be up for debate. Very interesting though <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

When you don't score you're obviously not good, but I don't feel he was bad tonight either, worked hard and looked sharp. Goals are like ketchup, the great Ruud van Nistelrooij once said.

2485~~~
You know he had run offside when he headed that ball, right?

2486~~~
I don't think the system is suiting him, as with Falcao, Wilson either. It seems this system involves a lot of possession and passing with the midfield diamond and full backs, but there isn't enough directness to let the strikers get involved too. There aren't enough penetrating though balls that are attempted. It seems an out and out striker like RVP is right for the system. Rooney is as he covers so much ground. I'm unsure Falcao will be more successful than RVP.

2487~~~
Have to agree with pretty much all of that. When Rooney and Falcao are both 100% fit then van Persie should be on the bench based on his current form and performances. We all want him to get back to his best but right now he does need to be dropped for a while. I was one who thought under van Gaal he would flourish and score for fun but unfortunately that just hasn't been the case. 

Van Persie has been a world class player and is more than capable of rediscovering his form down the line but he isn't contributing enough so Falcao will hopefully get his chance to start soon. Van Persie was incredible in his first season for us and we pretty much have him to thank for winning the league but he doesn't look anywhere close to that level right now so it's only right he makes way for Falcao and Rooney when they're fit if his form doesn't improve soon. His goal against Hull was beautiful though so should go some way to helping his confidence hopefully.

2488~~~
It's a tough one. It's one of those things where being at the game is of far more use than watching at home. Often the run is only as good as the pass. Especially if it's a tough "risky" creative pass. There was a point in the Arsenal game I remember well (because it really annoyed me at the time) where Di Maria made a fantastic run on a break, but Rooney didn't even attempt to find him because it was a tough ball. Instead he dribbled forward a bit, by which point Di Maria was offside, and Wayne eventually lost it anyway stumbling towards 3 defenders. I think LVG even mentioned it post match, and how we need to gain the confidence to play those types of pass. Maybe we're not there yet? 

It's hard to know whose at fault conclusively from TV. Though I certainly agree we made very, very little today, which was very disappointing.

2489~~~
Yep. He's working hard, and he wasn't poor really, but he wasn't that good either. Been that way all season, and much of last year with the goals covering up. Not a patch on the Van Persie between 2011 and 2013, and his place in the team is definitely under threat, with Rooney maybe coming back from injury in the next game, Falcao probably being fit enough to start, Wilson looking like a brilliant youngster and having his pace. For him to keep his place, with the competition we have, he just needs to be on top of his game or score almost every game really. That's just how it is with the competition we have. At some other clubs maybe his performance would have been enough, but when you have Falcao, Rooney and Wilson to compete with, it's nowhere close to enough.

2490~~~
This game I really focused on Van Persie when he was on screen off the ball and he did make a lot of good runs but ignored the vast majority of the time. A couple I could understand but some passes to him were so simple to make but players preferred one more touch or a more complicated pass, meaning the moves gone. I do think his performance today was a bit better than his previous ones this season

2491~~~
Same here. I noticed some nice runs as well, but given how deep Stoke's defence were, I somewhat doubt that those runs would have been useful. Only in the second half did things become better for us, and as a result, van Persie performed better.

One thing that really irks me is how van Persie is playing so high up the pitch and always trying to get into the box. So often, we are in dire need of a striker to drop back a bit to receive the ball in space and open things up, but van Persie never does this. Rooney's the best at this, and Falcao does this as well, whilst Wilson has yet to play like and is still learning. However, van Persie's performed like this so often at his best, so to see him play in such a limited way is worrisome for me. Maybe he's not physically cut out to play so dynamically?

2492~~~
Exactly, the standards have dropped so low after last season that I can't believe the excuses being made. When you look at Aguero, Costa, Lewandowski, Benzema and even Ibra who has been injured part of the season, he's a country mile off them all. We need to simply play Rooney as the main striker and play Herrera, Di Maria and Mata around him until we figure out if Falcao can cut it here.

2493~~~
I don't think he'll be dropped while Rooney is out while we have a lack of real seniors in the team.  I suppose Carrick could lead the team out as feck all chance of Fletcher starting.

2494~~~
Just seems that he's not on the same page as most of his other teammates (save Carrick) or he's just not getting along well with most people (conspiracy!). I mean I hardly saw Wilson pass to him, or for that matter Ander Herrera. The latter was our no.10 today, and he should have been making many more passes to RVP. Its probably why he started coming deeper in the second half to feel the ball at his feet.

There were at least 3 instances when he seemed pissed off with Valencia/Young/Wilson for not passing to him. I dont know, maybe he is not getting into the best of positions / maybe everyone is not on the same page as him. Something seemed amiss. 

Passes completed : 18/23

2495~~~
I can't understand the criticism. RVP is not your explosive "do it alone" Aguero type, he makes runs and feeds on passes, but Herrera decided to turn back each time a pass was on, he just turned and passed to the defenders and then what was Wilson thinking, a simple pass to RVP would have been better for the team, we could have gone 3-1 up but he was very selfish there and missed that great chance. Anyone who blamed him yesterday doesn't know much about football. I like that we keep the ball better these days, but my Lord, how many chances did we create? If RVP has to perform then players like Herrera [who was poor last night] and Mata have to start taking more risk with their passes into the final third, rather than doing it "safety first" all the time.

2496~~~
Or instead we should question why did he never pass to Wilson?Hilarious how biased some here can be on time over their favourite players (not saying you are, I'm referring to some other posts).He wasn't bad yesterday but in no world that's a good performance.People just don't want to accept that he's regressed and rightfully so with his age.

2497~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I like this place but when it turns against a player, mob mentality sets in and all reason flies out the window.

2498~~~
Our wingbacks and creative players need to do better for him. Either he was ignored or the delivery was abysmal.

2499~~~
His workrate was impressive I have to say but other than that he was mediocre. I understand that it is not easy for our strikers at the moment as we still lack quality play in the final third but I would try out Falcao and Rooney to see if that works out better

2500~~~
Yeah that pass should have been made to James Wilson, rather than Herrera.

2501~~~
With Rooney out and Falcao not fully fit he will continue to play, let's wait and see if LVG really has the balls to drop him when Rooney and Falcao are fully fit.

2502~~~
Coming in for a lot of stick again, but I disagree. On a lot of occasions last night RvP made a great run, and if found by the player on the ball he would have been clean through for a goal scoring opportunity.

2503~~~
I think I remember three times in around five minutes he was basically clean through and ignored by whoever had the ball, he went mental by the third one, understandably.

2504~~~
Van Persie has become a target, not sure why though. Had Herrera smashed his square ball hard and low he would've had an assist, had James Wilson squared it to Robin when they were two on one against the Stoke defence he would have scored. He put in quite a shift too, he didn't pick up a yellow card doing nothing. Van Persie tracked back a lot last night and generally made himself available when we were building attacks. I've no complaints with his performance and on merit he deserves to start at Southampton.

2505~~~
Yeah, I had 3 in my head (maybe 4) but couldn't be sure so I didn't post it. But you are right, I do remember his reaction. My reaction too tbh, as I couldn't for the life of me see how a player couldn't see the run?

2506~~~
Well one was Wilson's chance, which to be fair I think he had a right to go for as he made it for himself and you want to see a bit of confidence like that from a youngster, poor finish in the end though. Herrera had a shocker of a one though, think he moved it right to Mata instead who was in a far worse position than RvP.

2507~~~
I thought that yesterday he was fine.

2508~~~
There was another off herrera too early on, and one off mata in the second half if I remember correctly.

2509~~~
That seems close to Torres like level of praise at his lowest point at Chelsea when he was good at defending corners.

To me RVP shouldn't be playing really, I didn't think he was particularly brilliant against Hull but scored a great goal. The problem is you get to a point where the goal masks the performance and it can become a hindrance on the team. People seem to want to make excuses for him a lot of the time but it seems most of it is down to him, just doesn't look like he wants to be playing.

2510~~~
The Valencia one at the end was the worst when Stoke had everyone forward. RVP had a good 20 yards of space between himself and the defence yet Valencia waited about 10 seconds till he was well offside.

2511~~~
Pretty much half of Rooney's performances then? He doesn't want to be playing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> How can you work that out?

2512~~~
I mean he worked hard and it is true a couple of his runs were ignored but it was a sub-par performance again. There's no doubting that.

2513~~~
Rooney produces far more than just goals I'd say but then Rooney seems to divide opinion a lot on hereand it tends to go round in circles forever without getting anywhere so it's probably not worth the hassle for either of us.

I'm not "working it out" it's more of a figure of speech, along the lines of "this player looks like he doesn't want to be here" well I'm sure they all want to be there picking up £100,000 a week but it's difficult for them when they know they're out of form.  Seems a bit anal you'd pick up on it really, was hardly like I tried making out he's handing in a transfer request this morning or something.

2514~~~
Completely forgot about that one. Just switch MUTV on and seen it again. feck me it was obvious, he was in miles of space. It must be frustrating for him to make good runs throughout the game and constantly get ignored. But not only that, he then gets criticised off his own fans for apparently being shit. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Funny thing is, on a different day if our midfielders had looked up and spotted the pass, he could have easily bagged a hat trick, and everyone would be signing his praises.

2515~~~
Oh yeah, I'd be raging if I never got that pass, heck even in a game of 5 a sides it's frustrating.

2516~~~
Mata should have seen the run too on 63:50. Very strange he didn't pass, as it was a simple one for Mata to pull off.

2517~~~
The criticism he's getting is because there's more to being a world class striker than making a few decent runs, whether they're ignored or not. And he's supposed to be a world class striker. At least he was one, fairly recently.

2518~~~
Not that I disagree, but if he'd scored a hat trick yesterday through being found on those runs, then we wouldn't be having this conversation.

2519~~~
He didn't set the world on fire yesterday, but he looked much sharper and more eager. Also, did someone buy him a turbo? He looked much, much faster than I've seen him - downright fast at times. 

He still dallies a bit too much on the ball, and his dribbles aren't too sharp either, but I thought that he did OK.

2520~~~
Kind of. Although he scored a screamer at the weekend (after being found on one of those runs) and you still had a lot of people pointing out his overall performance wasn't great (which was fair criticism IMO)

Dunno what the feck's going on with him, to be honest. I keep expecting him to turn the corner but it's just been so long since he was anything like his best. In fact it's been so long that I think people are starting to forget how good he actually was, hence we're clinging on to stuff like a few good runs (without actually touching the ball) as evidence of an acceptable performance.

2521~~~
Jesus Christ standards are at an all-time low here. This is the Robin van Persie thread, yes? People cannot be content with the starting striker for Manchester United, who has 4 goals in 13 matches, to simply 'make alright runs' and do nothing else all game. Sure, there's an element of players not catching his movement and not getting the ball at the best of times, but the world class strikers get over that and do more. He simply isn't doing that - it's no case of people witch-hunting a player for being shit and past it, he just isn't delivering anywhere near enough. It would be like praising a CB solely for his headed clearances.

2522~~~
True, but even world class strikers need to be given the ball, and not just having to chase them out to the corner flag, which happened too often yesterday. Criticisms of him previously not looking interested could not apply for yesterday.

2523~~~
He's set such high standards that average performances look really bad. But that is the standard you have to be at a top club, maybe he does need to be dropped just to get some motivation back into him, it's clear to see this is not the same RVP of 2012 no matter how much we sugarcoat it with saying he made runs.

2524~~~
Not even. It'd be like praising a CB for doing a good job staying close to a striker, when the ball is at the other end of the pitch.

2525~~~
Aye, fair point about criticism at the weekend after his goal. After watching him last night though I'm feeling much more comfortable that he is moving in the right direction. Yeah, he didn't score, but for me looked better in his all-round play. I don't for one minute think the RvP of two seasons ago is lost and will never be seen again, I think it's just a matter of time before he's on fire again.

2526~~~
Would he though?

I'd be very interested to see his stats on his finishing when 1 on 1 with the keeper this season, because pretty much every time I've seen him get played clean through he's either shot straight at the keeper or been flagged offside.

Also, there are countless posts talking about how RvP's runs are being ignored, but the thing is you can apply this to any CF in the league - watch Aguero and count how many of his runs off the shoulder AREN'T picked out by teammates, you'll be surprised.

It gets talked about as if other teams pick out every single run that their striker makes.

Making runs is what CFs <i>do</i>, if you want to give our strikers minutes based on how many runs they attempt then bring Hernandez back and give him the number 9 shirt.

2527~~~
If people seriously think van Persie hasn't declined, they need to watch videos of him from 11/12 or 12/13. Not even half the player now. People are clutching at straws saying some of the things to try and hide the fact that his age and injuries have made him decline to where he is now, not simply bad form.

2528~~~
Yeah. I'm not sure if people forget that 'decline' doesn't mean 'completely drop to Championship standards one morning after waking up'.

He's still capable of those superb goals, because he has great technique (same goes for someone like Berbatov) but I don't see him ever getting back to that level of two/three years ago.
No doubt he'll have one or two games this season where he scores a couple of great goals, and some will be quick to say "I told you so" and "What decline?", but it's over 30 odd games where his value is up for question. 

I think he's best off going to Italy or somewhere slower.

2529~~~
Justifying Van Persie's current form more or less degrades the version of Van Persie that was, for a period, the best centre forward in Europe. As you say, the difference between now and a few seasons back is night and day.

2530~~~
I don't think anyone has mentioned Championship level but he is certainly looking like (non-Juve) Serie A level. Based on the last 18 months, he wouldn't be a starter for any club we would consider a peer.

2531~~~
Yeah, people automatically assume players turn to shit all of a sudden when people say decline. Its a slow and steady process, and you could say he's been on the decline since his 11/12 season. Was absolutely world class in 12/13 of course, but scored 7 goals less, and then of course last season and now this.

2532~~~
Agreed.

2533~~~
He’s frustrating at the moment but it’s not all down to him. Yesterday he made some wonderful runs in the second period but Herrera, Mata and Fellaini failed to find him and Wilson never gave him the ball.

I saw him hanging the poor Wilson for the lack of pressing  (especially at the beginning of the second half) and the lack of ball, he asked Fellaini twice to cross the ball first touch. Every time he was in front of Shawcross and when the ball finally arrived, 2.3 touches after, he was marked and we lost the pace in our game.

Note also that the team is far slower that what we used to be 2 years ago, we have less cross and less balls in the box. I think we control more the game and we’re more looking for “lag” in the opponent’s defense than killing them with pace. At Arsenal, and in his first year, there was pace all around him, he was the main target.

I remember his best performance during his first year, Valencia, Rooney, Young and Giggs, worked for him as we were a counter attacking team. His goals at Chelsea for example, or his late against N’Castle. His game is about the right timing, adjusting the run to the pace of the counter attack.

Look at the Stoke game once again, and focus on him, he was terrific at keeping the ball up, but when he changed side there was no pace, the same for few counter we had. Herrera played safe balls, Mata and Fellaini missed their balls, and finally he wasn’t helped high by Wilson.

So I think that the problem is 50/50…. He has to adapt his game to our style now, and probably we have to play more with him

2534~~~
I don't know why this is not being mentioned enough in this thread he looked as fit and as quick as i've ever seen him. I don't think i've ever seen him chase back and press as intensely as he had yesterday. There was a moment when he sprinted past our entire midfield and made an impressive amount of ground to win the ball back.

2535~~~
Really think this 'decline' is overstated. This bad-mediocre form would need to continue for at least the rest of the season for me to think he was finished with us.

2536~~~
Should he be dropped: absolutely. He should be starting on the bench.
Will he be dropped: nope. Along with Rooney, De Gea, Di Maria and Blind, his name is probably the first on the team-sheet. Guaranteed starter.

The real low point came against Arsenal, where he was a passenger - I think he broke some sort of negative record for not touching the ball in that game, not sure.
The next game, he started. And the next. And will continue doing so.

The shocking thing is that for all the glass players we have in our team, this guy never gets injured. He is bullet proof.
Even Rooney, who is normally made of rock, is now injured. Perhaps the reason why RvP isnt getting injured is because he hardly touches the ball...but who knows.

2537~~~
You've made up your mind about him! it's frustrating to see how people forgot that RvP can do magic some other strikers cannot. It was very clear Wilson should have passed it to him. Even he couldn't score, it doesn't mean he shouldn't be given the ball in the first place because you just don't know!!!

2538~~~
He did fine against Stoke City. He looked sharper, quicker, and was better on the ball than against Hull (in the first half). However, Stoke's game plan made it difficult to play as he normally does this season, and I was very surprised that he didn't adjust his game to overcome Stoke's defensive game plan, especially with Wilson around, who's skill set is currently more specific than van Persie's.

In this match, with Stoke sitting so deep and our midfielders dragging theirs away to create spaces in the middle, van Persie should have popped into those spaces and drag the Stoke defenders away, creating running avenues for Wilson, Mata/Herrera, etc. However, he didn't do this, and Wilson and van Persie were essentially playing the same exact role for much of the match, which resulted in our attacks being slower, and our play being less incisive, particularly in the first half when Stoke kept it tight in the middle and defence.

In the second half, we only got better once Stoke started pushing and creating gaps for Mata and Herrera to exploit. Otherwise, only Wilson changed his game slightly to drag the defenders away so he could beat them with this runs. van Persie was, as usual, playing more like how I expected Wilson to play in this match.

Something happened under Moyes. van Persie completely changed his style of play under him, and other than the World Cup campaign, he hasn't really looked like what he was before Moyes came here. Nowadays, he's pretty much playing like a traditional striker with others having to either change their game for him (Falcao, Wilson) or Rooney having to help make our attacks more incisive. With Falcao and Wilson, van Persie needs to control his selfishness and work more for the team with drawing defenders away from the back line. This way, his partner will do more of the same, and we can have a stronger attacking setup. However, van Persie's played more strictly than I would expect him to with Falcao, Wilson, and Rooney having to do what van Persie should also do every time. This makes it easier for the opposition to close van Persie down unless his partner does the job of dragging defenders away.

Personally, I feel like van Persie is becoming obsessed with scoring goals, which is why his movement, positioning, and overall game is set up as it currently is and not what it naturally should be. In this case, we must play Rooney alongside him in order to break down defences like Stoke's in the first half. With two strikers just staying up front and trying to get into the box, we will have a tough time breaking down teams parking the bus unless one of the strikers drops a little bit back into the hole and drag the defenders away, which Rooney and Falcao do at the moment.

2539~~~
This clip is a month old now but I don't think much has changed since. I stumbled upon it today and found it interesting. Sorry if it has been discussed already.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ewFBzMk-w3Y?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Do you agree with Gary? Has RvP really regressed as much as most say or is he simply a victim of our changed style and way of playing?. Does he need to be at the center of it all, without others getting in his way or could he adapt and find a role in our current setup?

2540~~~
There’s a few things at play, especially the injuries to the side and change of style. RVP’s not as good as he was 2 years ago but I think the overall team improvement we’ve seen in the last month is going to work to his benefit very soon.

Early on, with so many changes and injuries, we were still relying on individual brilliance and set pieces as our primary threats. We saw glimpses of the good interplay but there was still a lot of hoofing in long balls from deep and bypassing the midfield from the defenders and Rooney+di Maria. Still very Moyesian. That’s changing now, with Carrick+Herrera back and Fellaini in form. They, with Mata and Rooney, are carrying the ball forward, drawing defenders and creating space. Then, they've been picking out the attacking runs or laying it off to other CMs. This wasn't happening nearly as much early on, we really only looked dangerous when di Maria would run up from CM and create havoc.

The quality of the chances we’re creating is going up and as we create more opportunities, better opportunities, the finishing will also improve. It hasn't all clicked yet, but I think it’s a matter of fine tuning now. We've added variety back to the style – counter attack against Arsenal, attack through the middle against Hull or spread it wide and come back in like against Stoke. The strikers are all guilty of forcing it a bit right now, but if we can maintain health for a bit (especially in midfield) I think RVP, Falcao, and Wilson are going to start banging in the goals.

2541~~~
I like Van Persie a lot as a player, but I think it needs to be acknowledged that he's been in incredibly poor form for over a year!

He was so poor during last season and at the World Cup that <i>many</i> on here were convinced that he was needing an operation of some sort and were shocked when it turned out he didn't!

It's important not to ignore the length of time that this poor form has gone on for. Because in all honesty, right now, he's getting game time on reputation alone.

2542~~~
Well, reputation is critical. Opposition know who can be dangerous and it scares them.

And Giggsy is a good example when he's suffering from his hamstring, he's not in perfect form but the manager knew he's still useful and looked how he from time to time bailed us out after all. And he's getting stronger and stronger, still playing when he's 40

Van Persie had an amazing WC, although might be dipping nearer closure. I don't for one minute believe LvG played him at United for reasons other than footballing!!!

2543~~~
Seriously... What made his World Cup amazing? I'm convinced I watched a different World Cup.

2544~~~
His flying header stood out, one which is easily the best goal in the tournament. That alone is amazing. The image if such a Flying Dutchman was immortalised as an art piece in Rio and so much talked about. Have you missed it? I felt for you if you have

2545~~~
And that made his whole World Cup showing amazing for you? Fair enough.

2546~~~
Winning the World Cup is amazing no doubt but as a small country, helping his team to play third beating the host country is definitely an amazing experience and achievement.

2547~~~
Good clip, especially since it shows both sides of the coin. Yes, the service into him hasn't been the same as in his first season. I think, partly, us playing less direct football means fewer of the passes in behind that Gary is talking about here. But, as Gary starts to go into (but one could show dozens of clips of it this season), his buildup play has been pretty awful this season.

I think you're confused. Robben was amazing, RvP'd had 2 excellent games and was invisible for the rest of the tournament.
Many people  claimed that taking off RvP (twice actually) was LvG' s stroke of genius but as a matter of fact, Robin was just pure shit.

2549~~~
You sound like a terrible fan! No one is arguing Robben had a great performance without whom The Netherlands might not have gone that far. But this thread is not about Robben so it's you who's being confused. Bye!

2550~~~
Are you saying we should play RvP because his reputation scares opposition...?

Really?

Um... Giggs has retired - you know that though, right?

No he didn't. Wonder header aside, he was actually fairly poor given his previous ability.

2551~~~
Why not? I don't understand all the haters. He's having a dip in form yet he would be scoring some crucial goal despite it. His ability to score amazing goals should not have been disputed. Can't believe all those historical revisionists on here.

And your point? When I quoted Giggsy as an example, it shows how you can't write off important player too soon too readily. All you haters seem to want to hang RvP or lock him away. He's starting because his manager saw what he can do in training and still has faith in him and be one of 11 players who can contribute to win. But you lot think he's getting favour from the manager because he's Dutch. I disagree totally.

People should be patient with him before there's a clear cut replacement the manager can deploy. Falcao is just coming back and LvG is correct not to start him too soon

2552~~~
Apparently RvP has made more runs than a guy with a belly full of dodgy curries, and it's everyone elses fault for not finding him, well that's that solved then.

2553~~~
Where were you when he scored? Fans like you should be ashamed of yourself for being so disrespectful. I am not here to defend the striker but post like this is so unnecessary. Can imagine how hurtful it is when your own fans turned their back against you with thess ruthless remarks.

2554~~~
Has it got to the point where we arent allowed to criticise our players on a messageboard for fear of hurting their feelings?

2555~~~
You're allowed to say anything but being sarcastic and disrespectful and yet not constructive go to show your characters

2556~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2557~~~
I think RVP is going to turn the corner soon. I think he'll have a few games now where he scores a few goals in a row, confidence comes back, and he'll start to look the part again. I don't necessarily think he'll ever get back to the level of his first season, but that's more or less to be expected at his age. Do I think he should be dropped? No, personally I don't.

What I also think will happen, when he turns the corner, it'll be like the Rooney thread. A few weeks ago, all that was going on in there was people wanting him dropped, people happy he was sent off, people complaining about his "get the ball, kick it to right winger" tendencies. Now, it's like he's Messi. People lamenting that he's out etc.

The fickle nature of this forum astounds me at times.

RVP is a class act. He's not done.

2559~~~
You are just joking right? Otherwise lets head to the sentimentality thread as this is ridiculous, he's been woeful this season, he's a grown man and a very well paid one, I am sure he doesn't care what anyone here posts whether it's positive or negative, and my post was clearly just in fun at the rabid defense some are making for a striker clearly way off the required level we need.

2560~~~
And you were serious about "....RvP has making more runs than a guy with a belly full of dodgy curries..." Talking about double standard. My point was, in all seriousness, if RvP scored a few crucial goals (which I still believe he's capable of) in the next few games, will you eat your humble pies and your leather shoes?!!

2561~~~
No, I just said that my post was clearly meant to be a joke dig at those who are making endless excuses for RvP, then you come in acting all dramatic at me like i'd stolen some sweeties from a kid dying of cancer. Leather shoes? Anyway if RvP starts playing well, never mind goals, I'll take some actual good performances, then sure I will admit I am wrong, if he is still playing well below part 10 games from now will you come back and admit you are wrong?

2562~~~
In 10 games times we'll convene again and determine whether Van Persie has been playing to an acceptable standard. The loser has to eat a pair of leather shoes.

2563~~~
I'm an independent observer in this by the way. I won't be eating shoes either way. Just wanted to be absolutely clear on that.

2564~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Well, will you? <a class="username" data-user="48107, @Devil may care" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48107/">@Devil may care</a>

2565~~~
Never have put it better. LoL. It certainly feels you are a mean person and just a bit disrespecful to our striker albeit tongue in cheek. But there are worse (someone used words "he's utter sh*t". 

Anyway, moving on, if leather shoes are too much for you, then an apology here should be a good gesture. As for me, I always am being fair and if I was wrong I would be ready to admit it. Deal!

2566~~~
I don't think criticizing a 150k a week footballer who isn't performing well is mean, but ok.

If RvP is only suffering a dip I'll gladly admit he has proved me wrong, I just think his legs are shot, time will tell though.

2567~~~
The Pie certainly, hopefully it's apple with plenty of custard. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2568~~~
He's been fine last two games that I've seen but I have been at the matches, there's an awful lot the cameras don't see and the subtle movement of Van Persie is certainly one of them. 
Herrera and Carrick where slightly off the boil against Stoke and that contributes to Van Persies effectiveness but he's still getting in those spaces and making those bending runs around centre backs.  He was also hampered by Wilson wanting to play in the same area of the pitch, great minds maybe but he still had a very good game and should have had a goal for 2 in 2. 
He's by no means finished he just needs the service and currently he's been paired with Rooney and Wilson both of whom drop off and  in Wilsons case when he did get forward he was under Van Persies feet, it allows defenders to effectively double up on him and deny him the yard he needs. 
Once Falcao gets fit defenders won't have the luxury of marking just the one world class senior striker and Van Persie will get his yard, Carrick and Herrera will also be picking up match sharpness along the way and will hopefully start to find those runs he makes with a bit more consistency. 
The humble pie shall flow within this thread and we shall all be merry and dance.

2569~~~
That would certainly be weird if his legs are shot now, considering he tore Spain and other teams apart during the World Cup 6 months ago...the key difference which I think is resulting in his lack of "form" is the difference in the build-up play between Netherlands and United, but that will change soon as the team continues to adopt LVG's philosophy. It is no surprise that RVP is looking increasingly "better" and more threatening with each passing game.

In the early season, our midfield was too slow and too static, which made it too easy for defenders to man-mark and isolate RVP. Now, with multiple threats and a faster pace, this is giving RVP more space and opportunities.

2570~~~
The game against Spain was the only one he really played well in, in the WC in my opinion, Robben was by far the most important cog in the Dutch machine. The thing that struck me against Hull is how out of place he looked with Mata, Herrera and Rooney wanting to move the ball at a quick tempo, it was like we bypassed him in order to not lose the momentum of our attack.

2571~~~
To some extend this is true, though in 5-3-2 and being the deep striker with Robben with the free role it is incredibly hard to make the difference since there was no to little support. Plus what most people do not know he was hit by a virus after the poule phase, that really costed him. Maybe only Zlatan could have done something different than RvP did. I really do not believe other top strikers would have done much better than RvP did. Being the deep striker in 40 degrees celsius, keep making runs without ever getting the ball isn't the most appreciated job.

2572~~~
Think he misses Scholes. Or he could just be finished, either i guess.

2573~~~
He's been our best player so far but that isn't as high praise as it should be.

2574~~~
He's looked good tonight. Rooney, and Mata have been crap and anonymous respectively. Felliaini has been dog shite.

2575~~~
Considering how little of the ball he's seen (in possession or even anywhere near him) he's done very well with what little supply he's getting.

2576~~~
I would use good lightly. Our best player but considering the performance, I don't think that says much.

2577~~~
Playing at the back now. Waste of his passing ability.

2578~~~
He looks much sharper, his movement is quicker and more decisive, he's not looking laboured like he has recently.

2579~~~
Best he's been all season. Pity his strike partners playing like a donkey though

2580~~~
He's been one of the few really good performers. Pretty much the only one you feel confident of keeping possession when he gets it.

2581~~~
Playing like his 12/13 self. Hope he gets the winner if it comes to us...

2582~~~
It's infuriating how he slows our attacks down though. I he gets the ball with players ahead of him, ratger than looking to play the ball forward he shifts it wide or backwards so he can join the attack himself. 

When you've got a strike pertner and an attacking midfielder on the field you dont have to play like you're a lone striker leading the line.

2583~~~
Yes son

2584~~~
He deserves that, he's done well tonight.

2585~~~
Not saying he's dramatically improved but this was my point. His value is still there. Especially in games like this when we're utter shite.

2586~~~
Good description of rooneys performance tonight.

2587~~~
Is he still shit and Welbeck much better etc.....

2588~~~
You silver fox Flying Dutchman beauty!

2589~~~
Goals aside, best game in ages. Sometimes goals flatter a performance. Not tonight. Been really grafting. Great stuff.

2590~~~
Good luck to Falcao trying to get in.

2591~~~
Strange actually. Been standing out all season by being our worst player on the pitch. The exact opposite tonight. Best by a margin.

2592~~~
He has been top class today. His hold up play has been excellent. Brilliant second goal as well.

2593~~~
He's been doing that for the last 3/4 games, some if it just gets missed, sadly.

2594~~~
Someone's finally entered the lost RVP cheat code from 2012.

Still, there's another 15 minutes of blind squeeky bum terror ahead again before we can be sure, I feel.

2595~~~
Because some have made up their mind that he's passed it and ignore any good work that he does.

2596~~~
RVP, RVP, RVP

2597~~~
Fantastic performance. Probably his best this year.

2598~~~
Seriously, how can someone say his performances earlier this season was down this service? Brilliant today, improved everything but mostly the hold up play which was missing before.

2599~~~
He's been fecking great tonight, regardless of how it turns out.

2600~~~
To be fair it's difficult to see his work if the passes aren't finding him. You can only really see it from the stands.

2601~~~
Not sure about that. Seems to be so much more involved. Stats will be interesting. 

Strange position too. Very wide on the right.

2602~~~
He hasn't been as bad as some have made out and it has been greatly exaggerated how poor he has been. He has struggled at times and had some poor matches, yet he still has 6 league goals to his name. Our changing of formation and awful play at times, certainly haven't helped.

2603~~~
That's where he played V Arsenal, I've said it before, it's extremely difficult to see his worth if the passes don't find him (you have to be in the stands) but against Hull and Stoke he was outstanding.

2604~~~
Fair enough.

Dunno why it's so much more obvious on the telly tonight but I'll take your word for it. Hard to see all the off the ball graft when you're not at the game.

2605~~~
World Cup hangover? Looks like he's got his legs back.

2606~~~
Done well tonight. Impressive when you look at and see that despite having been playing terrible for most of the season, he's still got a half-decent goals return for us.

2607~~~
Welcome back RvP!

2608~~~
That's Robin at his best, impeccable holdup play.

2609~~~
Welcome back RVP. You have been missed.

2610~~~
Two wonderful finishes. His hold up play and effort was exemplary too. Good game for him.

2611~~~
Aaaaaawesome. Even without goals, easy MOTM for me, worked like a horse.

2612~~~
Criticised him a lot recently, but he won us the match today.

2613~~~
Ohhhh Robinnnn Van Perssieeeeeeee

2614~~~
He had a perfect game, his holding up play was fantastic! just in time for Liverpool <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2615~~~
I know our play has been a bit hit and miss this season but i love how many match winners we have in our team these days.

2616~~~
Pure class today especially with very little support. When he's in this sort of form he's brilliant to watch.

2617~~~
That was a monster number 9 performance. I have a feeling that the man is back <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2618~~~
More then just the goals, he was brilliant all round in the second half. Held the ball up well, his touch was good and all the beautiful silky skills were also there.

2619~~~
Van Persie at his best, great performance, finally.

2620~~~
Incredible performance from him, even discounting his goals, MOTM for me today. To bad Rooney and Mata were shite, why can we only have one attacking player in form at all times

2621~~~
Great all around performance from Van Persie in a while. Very glad to see that.

2622~~~
It's a shame I wasn't able to watch the game, but RVP has been improving over the last three games, so tonight is not a large surprise. It would've shocked me if he had suddenly fallen off of a cliff. All he needs to do now stay healthy. Right now, there is no question that him and Rooney are our starters up front. Falcao can't stay healthy anyways.

2623~~~
His best game for over a year, he was fantastic in everything tonight.

2624~~~
Said all season that despite others having a go at him, he's our best striker.

2625~~~
Absolutely huge performance. His goals were fantastic, but his all round performance was equally as good.

Thats the Robin we all know and love. World fecking class.

2626~~~
We needed a reminder of what he's capable of. What a fecking fantastic player, I feel bad for doubting him.

Please please keep this up Robin!

2627~~~
He's been coming increasingly better, the way he moves off the ball has never changed though and the difference is the service. 
Carrick and Herrera I feel are so important to him.

2628~~~
Heroic performance! He held the frontline like a boss and was able to keep the ball like the RVP of old. Was singlehandedly responsible for that win. He's back ladies and gents!

2629~~~
Best player tonight on the outfield by a long long way. DDG only other player of note. 

More of the same please.

2630~~~
Class finishes both of them. Wouldn't have any other strikers on end of those when you need a goal.

2631~~~
How brilliant was that to watch, him in the second half playing as if Fergie was still around??

Hope there are many more of those performances to come from him. It's been a long while since we've seen them, but he's well and truly a class apart when he plays like this.

2632~~~
Seriously never write this guy off. He's a world class striker and he will be until the day that he retires. MOTM tonight easily. He ran all over the place non stop and took his goals like all great strikers do.

2633~~~
Brilliant throughout, really lead the line

2634~~~
A one man show tonight, wonderful stuff.

2635~~~
Didn't put a foot wrong today I think. 2 chances - 2 goals, clinical and great team play on top of that.

2636~~~
Bailed us out like he did 2 years ago, perfect match, can't fault him for anything really.

Only player tonight that looked good.

2637~~~
He was great today. His hold up play was brilliant and his sharpness was definitely back with sharp turns and flicks.

2638~~~
World class today. Even without the goals. His poorest contribution was that clearance at the end, which says it all. He barely put a foot wrong all game.

2639~~~
Almost Cantona-esque type of display. Definitely inspired team to win.

LVG's ongoing trust in him is also the key.

2640~~~
Got us out of a hole there . Bright spark in an average team performance.

2641~~~
Showed guts and proper bollocks tonight. He was outstanding.

2642~~~
Superb performance. I'd say the best individual performance we've had this season.

2643~~~
Welcome back robin, the real rvp has stood up tonight.

If only the rest of our team showed half his bollocks we would be ok

2644~~~
few have written him off too early methinks.

Replacement for Aguero in fantasy footy methinks!

2645~~~
That was him. Even when lacking service he can do that. Just do it more often Robin.

2646~~~
Lovren and co. will get hammered on the weekend. He's in the mood.

2647~~~
Silenced some doubters today I hope.

2648~~~
I'll take a slice of that humble pie. Good performance, let's hope he builds on it against the dippers.

2649~~~
Van Persie of the old. Took his only two chances and was great at hold up play.

2650~~~
Quoting myself while I can in case this doesn't last

2651~~~
Was like watching him at his best two years ago again, when he was our goalscorer and playmaker all in one. Looked strong on the ball again, like he would never ever waste possession. Thank feck really, given how bad everyone else (bar Young) was.

2652~~~
Pretty much a perfect performance.

2653~~~
In the zone tonight, amazing what confidence does to players.

2654~~~
First time he hasn't looked an 80 year old widow and the rest of the team were awful!!

Seriously that was an excellent forward display.

2655~~~
Absolutely fantastic today, MOTM easily.

2656~~~
The performance tonight just underlined that people were right in being unhappy with him before. 

No need to rewrite history by pretending he's not been gash.

2657~~~
This guy will be a world class striker until the day that he retires. Never write him off. Outstanding performance from him tonight. Especially considering how sh*t everyone else bar Young was.

2658~~~
...Oh Robin Van Persie...

...Need I say more? "Talisman".

2659~~~
So pleased LVG stood by him.

A performance full of grit, determination, commitment and perseverance.

He retained the ball excellently on the counter and his two goals were about as clinical as they come.

More of the same please, Robin, and long may your performances continue.

2660~~~
The perfect striker performance tonight.

2661~~~
If he continues to stay in that sort of form now and he actually gets a decent amount of service it'll be a big boost for us heading into the Christmas period. The way he bagged those two goals there tonight and he feeding off scraps along with his work rate was top notch.

2662~~~
Good to see him play well again. Amazing player to watch when in full flow.

2663~~~
Held the ball up, came for the ball and scored. He can hang his head high.

2664~~~
That was not what I was trying to say. I was responding to people saying he should be dropped. I never thought that was the best way to turn his form around. He's starting to look like he might have played through that terrible run of form. Especially considering how shite we were as a team today.

2665~~~
A new man, even apart from the goals he was quality all over the pitch with his old self hold up play. Joy to watch.

2666~~~
MOTM so easily they should make the rest of the side carry him out to get it, as an ironic gesture.

2667~~~
Pity we didn't bench him and start Wilson instead.

2668~~~
A confident inform RvP is simply a joy to behold. I hope he stays fit for the rest of the season and keeps scoring brilliant goals for us.

2669~~~
Looked himself tonight, grew into the match and towards the end he was impressing with every involvement. 

Wonderful to see he's still got it.

2670~~~
Immense today. Not just with the goals, which were great strikes, but with his work-rate from the front was really important as well, particularly when Southampton were starting to dominate. So much better than what we've seen from him so far, hope he can keep this form going against the scousers.

2671~~~
Played well tonight. Held the ball up well, and you can't argue with two goals.

2672~~~
He was absolutely brilliant today. Really do not recall anything he did wrong. 2 great finishes both megging the keeper. His hold up play was excellent and he showed that he can still turn it on if he has the confidence to do so. It was a refreshing sight to see.

2673~~~
Forget the goals, that was his best performance since Fergie left I'd say.

Excellent.

Good touch, hold up play, worked hard, fed on scraps from a non existent midfield.

Much improved.

2674~~~
Quality performance, even without the goals, held the ball up so well, was the only United player not to give it away cheaply every 5sec.
Just glad that shit challenge at the end didn't have him going down injured.

2675~~~
Not just the goals, but his calmness under pressure, carrying the ball from the midfield (occasionally taking a Southampton player for a spin around the pitch whilst he does it) - what is it they say about form and class?

2676~~~
Saved us. These three points belong to him.

And I am not saying it because of his two goals. It was his overall strength, hold up and link up play that got us through tonight. Immense performance.

2677~~~
Koeman's pep talk before the game really helped.

2678~~~
Only just realised he scored 2 megs <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2679~~~
That was as good as anything he's produced in 12/13 and 11/12. Absolute perfection.

2680~~~
What a player.  Love him!

2681~~~
The most impressive thing about him tonight was his hold up play. Took his goals well, stood up and faced his criticism.

2682~~~
Match winning commitment, good to see it back in him. Hoping he keeps it up and the rest feed off him - that's what got us the title in 12/13

2683~~~

2684~~~
Well, we won't see that anymore when he signs for Liverpool.

2685~~~
World class today. Back to his best. Hopefully he can keep it up and it's not just a one off. We've really missed that hold up play.

2686~~~
Really good performance and even without the goals by far our best player. Fair play to him

2687~~~
Came in to say exactly this. At times it was like watching the Van Persie of 12/13, brilliant hold up play and was cleverly bringing others into play, especially in the 2nd half. Man of the match by a mile for me.

2688~~~
He was great considering the little supply he got today. Imagine how good he would have been if Fellaini, Mata, Rooney and Herrera could have got the ball to him more often.

2689~~~
Majestic performance. Southampton just couldn't nick the ball off him when he holds it up.

2690~~~
The judging of strikers is a funny business, especially Van Persie.

He had the best game of his season today, but if you look at his chances, they were all extremely difficult -- none were gimmes.  In fact, the entire season, people have been bagging RVP because he's "missed those chances he would have buried in 12/13", failing to realize those chances were extremely difficult and by no way a sure goal (I'm thinking of one I think against Chelsea where he was semi-through on goal and had to turn and shoot while Courtois was coming out to get him. He got so much crap for that when it was an extremely hard opportunity that needed a big stroke of luck to get it). Today, he put himself in the position to score (which, imo, he's done all season except vs Arsenal and maybe one or two others) and had that stroke of luck to nutmeg Forster twice.

I should preface by saying Van Persie is my favorite player to justify any bias, and I got angry when tons of the Caf gave him stick for not burying "the chances strikers should bury" and then now praising him for these two goals, considering his movement, build up play has been pretty consistent and the only difference between his Chelsea chance and his first goal today was the goalie opening his legs. He had a great game today in that everything he did was exceptional, but perhaps more importantly, luck was on his side today and that made the difference.

2691~~~
Brilliant display. Terrific hold up play, looked much sharper and seems to have regained some of his pace; he looks much faster these last two couple of matches. Also, he ran his socks off today. Motm by some distance!

When in form, he's still our best player!

2692~~~
That hasn't been a criticism I have heard much of. It has mostly been aimed at his all round play/holding the ball up and also getting himself into scoring positions with his movement. Which he was incredibly good at tonight

2693~~~
The fickle nature of football fandom.

Two weeks ago he was finished, now he's world-class again. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2694~~~
He was brilliant. Almost every time he received the ball, he impressed. Practically the only out-field player who wasn't conceding possession incredibly cheaply.

2695~~~
Very very good tonight and I am not just talking about the goals.

2696~~~
Form is temporary. Class is permanent..and all that malarkey. 

3 shots, 2 goals and job done. Definition of a match winner and basically got us the points today. Deserves the motm as he was the one shining beacon in a sea of shit. 

Rounding into form as the new year beckons. We will need him at his best for the second half of the season, which is working out perfectly as he is starting to find his feet.

2697~~~
Still got it. Great performance.

2698~~~
Contrary to the majority I don't think RVP has endless credit in LVGs books and tonight showed why it sometimes pays off if you show faith in a player and hang on to them during a spell of poor form. If Falcao had been fit, Rooney not been suspended against West Ham or Mata setting the world alight, Robin would have been dropped for a game or two, but in some games the decision was between RVP and Wilson. Yes, James looks a fantastic prospect and deserves his chances now and then, but van Persie is a proven world class striker and with all those great performances we have seen from him, earned the privilege to hang on to him for a few games. Even though he was a very mobile player some years ago, his technical ability, clever thinking and cool finishing always stood out. You don't lose those skills over night and whilst he is without a doubt physically declining, he always offers a threat around the box when he is in good form. He looked fired up today, his overall play was strong and his goals crucial. Him scoring these two important goals, securing us 3 points and moving up to 3rd place will really bost his confidence. Already celebrated like a cnut again with that overly confident smile, love it.

2699~~~
Worthy of praise today. He looked like his old self, didn't put a foot wrong.

2700~~~
Best match from him in a long time, well since Fergie left. Clinical.

2701~~~
Michael Carrick has a 100% record, if Carrick plays we win <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> one of the main reasons RVP had that stunning opening season at the club was Carrick bypassing our non existent midfield and finding him.
No surprise to me that now Carrick is in the side Van Persie has started to look the part, the bonus is Herrera who also has the ability to see those typical Robin runs. He's simply lacked service and I think he lost his shit for a few games but other than that he's been typical Van Persie.

2702~~~
Hopefully he goes on a run now.  We will need his goals for the December fixtures.

2703~~~
I remember daily fail making a list of the 100 greatest premier league strikers and Van Persie was like 20th. He is comfortably in the top 5-10. Better than Drogba too.

Even if you take away those two goals, he played at another level tonight compared to what he's been doing for a good while now. Most of the criticism towards him has been on that basis, not the fact that he's missing too many chances.

He worked his socks off, won the ball and held it up brilliantly, and contrary to most of our other players tonight, he was able to find team mates with quite a few of his passes. Or the short version, he just looked a lot better overall than he's done in a long while. Long may it continue!

2705~~~
Forget the goals, his best display this season.

And as for the goals, big moments that could prove crucial come May.

2706~~~
One of the best individual performances of any of our players this season. As many have stated already, even his goals aside, his hold up play was masterful. The only player who could handle Southampton's pressing.

2707~~~
Good game from him. Really good. Our best player by a long way. Let's hope he can string a few together now.

2708~~~
The guy was getting plastered by a lot of guys here. He was just out of form. Took his chances well. Very happy for him. Want him to be here for many years.

2709~~~
Well played Robin lad.

2710~~~
By far our best player today.

Played with passion and desire, worked hard, and took both his chances brilliantly!

I was very dissappointed with him, but ever since LVG went public about his poor overall play (after Arsenal) he started to play much more focused and somehow refreshed (or am I imaginig that?).

Hope he continues with performances like this, having full ready Van Persie is cheat mode sometimes!

2711~~~
He'll end up our top goal scorer this season, and well still have posters on the caf wanting Falcao and Rooney to start ahead of him.

Robin van Persie is the best striker I've ever seen play for Manchester United (since about 97ish when id of been 5).

2712~~~
When he's on he's a match winner, no doubt about that.

Of the thing about which there is doubt, this is not among them.

2713~~~
Loves scoring for us against Southampton!

What a performance, he was everywhere today, defending, working hard, holding up the ball oh and scoring 2 important goals. 

Very pleased for him, absolutely world class when in form!

2714~~~
The major positive from tonight was RVP's performance. What impressed me most was how his build up play seemed back to what it was a couple of seasons ago. He's a beast when he's like that and it's so good to see how he isn't finished just yet.

2715~~~
Sometimes we only see what we want to see, I watch him like a hawk, he's utterly mesmerising. He's had maybe two sulky games where he's given up as he's not had the service (amazingly Arsenal wasn't one) but he's been increasing in effectiveness with the supply opening back up. 

Just as an aside, Falcao has looked a very similar danger with his positioning and movement, if we get him fit Rooney might struggle.

2716~~~
I never doubted his ability but he was truly exceptional today for all the reasons stated above. My concern is that he still is not getting any service. The goals he scored were due to his intelligence/ anticipation rather than persons actually passing the ball to him. Mata still does not actively look for RVP but at least there were a couple of attempts at link up play between RVP and Rooney.
We won despite an absent midfield and an out of sorts defense so that is a plus but I am still waiting for us to gel as a complete team.
One thing for sure is that RVP has regained his confidence and people will stop calling for his head. Now all we need is to give the man some decent service.

2717~~~
Just finished watching the game, was slightly out of it in the first half, but what a sensational second half display. Hold up play was absolutely superb and he showed he still has it at the very highest level. Delighted for him.

That challenge by Mane near the end was utterly disgusting by the way, if that had injured him the Caf would have probably been in meltdown.

2718~~~
Let's see if he can continue this form for a fun of games.

2719~~~
What has Wilson got to do with anything? I get your trying to be sarcastic but a little childish.  RVP's best game in a long time. Pleased he got up from that tackle as we've some big games coming up.

2720~~~
It means exactly what it implies (with an added heap of sarcasm). We should be playing our experienced players rather than experimenting with youngsters at a time when we are struggling with consistency.

2721~~~
To be fair mate, calls for RvP to be dropped in recent weeks have hardky been knee jerk or unwarranted. 

Yea he's had a good match tonight, but that doesn't undo what's gone before. 

Let's just hope it's the turning of a corner for him.

2722~~~
His best game of the season, he actually went past opponents on more than one occasion and looked more mobile than he has in months.

2723~~~
Yep, he has been quite poor at times and I've mentioned several times in this thread that he's more or less finished as a top player. I'd still have his experience and skills over any youth player and today proved exactly why. We shouldn't have scored either goal if not for his ridiculous finishes, which no other player we have could've produced.

2724~~~
Raoul no offense but this is a forum and people have a right to give opinions. We won the game. Be happy not childish. The fact is, Wilson is our forth striker this season and therefore a valid option. The main thing is we saw a great performance from RVP but it's one game. Now we pick on Rooney till he starts scoring again <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2725~~~
That's why he should start ahead of Wilson or any other youth player for that matter. Excellent hold up play, especially in the second half, 2 goals that not many in the squad are capable of scoring. Has arguably had his best game of the season.

2726~~~
He's got his strength back, his fight. Reminded me of the man that won us a title. He'll score again vs Liverpool, just watch.

2727~~~
Didn't see the game, but judging by this thread he had a good game. Sounds like his goal last match may have given him a bit of confidence back, and allowed him to get back to doing what he is good at.
Good to see him get the two goals, and hopefully this good performance leads to a run of form and isn't just a one of.

2728~~~
just proved it once again, form is temporal and class is permanent.

the best thing to see was how rooney celebrated his goals with him.  earlier of the season rooney even deliberately chose not to pass to him.  i think rooney has finally realized they are no longer rivals.  they are now being on the same boat and robin goals can only do all good for rooney captaincy in united

2729~~~
thought van Persie looked pretty sharp again...his running and positioning were also like the van Persie of old.

He must start with Rooney again. We should be able to beat the scousers. Pity about Smalling though.

2730~~~
I've heard that also, but I've also definitely heard a ton of him missing "easy" chances that were in no way easy and unfair to say a 12/13 Van Persie would have scored them. Hopefully the hate will go away now, or at least start to dissipate.

2731~~~
Of the things about which there is no doubt, however, this is one of them.

2732~~~
Even without the goals, he had a very good match. Good strength, good protection, good movement and good linking up.

2733~~~
In my opinion those calls were unwarranted. Form is temporary, class is permanenet. Those who thought RVP was "past it" conveniently seem to forget his form during the World Cup, which was only 6 months ago. A player doesn't suddenly combust like that short of an injury or catastrophic life altering event. He had a dip in form, with the full possibility of getting back to his 2014 World Cup form, which would make him one of the top 3 strikers in the league.

2734~~~
I think the broader picture with RvP is he is 31 and not getting any younger, and given his sporadic lapses in form and injury history, we are not likely to see the same player we saw during his final years at Arsenal and first year at OT. He can still produce moments of brilliance, but whether or not he can produce them with any degree of consistency is clearly up for debate.

2735~~~
Maybe. He had little rest due to the WC and looked heavy-legged and jaded in the early part of the season .
Like you say, hope he has turned a corner. He looked fired up tonight and now Rooney has slid back into wretched form, we need him more than ever. Just a shame we can't get 6-7 players hitting form at once.

2736~~~
Credit to LVG for persisting with him, and playing him back to form.

2737~~~
I loved how he says that in the post match interview that he found lasting 90 mins easy. He was inspirational.

2738~~~
My concern remains. Van Persie is just not getting enough service. One can see that he has regained his confidence and the majority of fans are supportive of him again but his goals today were basically of his own making. Rooney's free kick was into a dangerous place but RVP made the run to get himself into that position to score. I hope other players will start to actively seek to give him the ball more, especially around the box.

2739~~~
A few have been saying it Raul and I'm echoing them. Service to his is dreadful and if we expect him to receive the ball in wide areas and run channels then we are going to be disappointed. But give the guy the ball around the 18 yard line or in the box and there a few in the world better.

2740~~~
He was pretty poor at the World Cup, Spain game aside. He scored against Australia but was rather anonymous other than that, in the knockouts he struggled (the whole Netherlands team only scored 2 goals, both late against Mexico between Last 16 and 3rd place game).

Brilliant yesterday. He will keep having these for many more years IMO, just not consistently.

2741~~~
Fantastic performance. Brilliant finishing, great hold-up play and he worked really hard. Flashback to 12-13. Rooney, Mata, Fellaini and Herrera were pretty much useless (I'm really not a huge fan of these two little spaniards), so it's really impressive how Robin really won us the game alone. We still need Di Maria and Blind back, but winning with these below average performances is a good sign.

2742~~~
Honestly I never saw the whole Rooney RVP rivalry. They've always seemed like good friends.

2743~~~
Absolutely sensational performance from Robin.

A lot of shite has been talked in this thread from people unable to differentiate between a player being in poor form and a player being finished.

2744~~~
Lol. Herrera I felt changed the match for us. Our worst period subsided after he came on.

2745~~~
Apart from the goals, he had an excellent all round game. He was available for a pass and was able to hold onto the ball and get other players involved. Hopefully he can avoid injuries and keeps this up.

2746~~~
Tbh it has looked like he's been on a steady decline for over a year now, not just poor form. Which is natural when you think of his age and all the injury problems he has had over the years. On song he's the perfect striker in every formation, even as a lone striker in a 4-5-1. He's still a classy player but you can easily see that he has lost a bit since his glory days. He didn't show that yesterday though. He was absolutely sensational, even without the goals. It's impossible to steal the ball from him when he's in that mood.

2747~~~
In my opinion, talk of long term decline is premature. We'll see how his season goes, but yesterday's performance was as good as anything he's ever produced for United.

2748~~~
It is, but he's been looking like a shadow of his former self for a while now though. Add to that his age and it's natural to see his lack of form as a sign that he's on a steady decline. I would love to be proven wrong though as he's just one of them players that you pay just to see him train. Agree with the assessment of his performance; that was vintage van Persie. He's such a good target man which is a bit funny when you consider he arrived in England as a frail winger.

2749~~~
Played well, got two goals. Delighted for him.

People demanding he be replacd with Falcao must be feeling very silly now.

2750~~~
Agree. He's deceptively strong and when he's on form, he shields the ball by backing in to the defender superbly. Particularly in the second half yesterday, he was absolutely brilliant - held it up and provided a platform for us to attack every time.

If he can maintain that level for the rest of the season, we have a striker capable of matching Aguero's impact, albeit  in a different style.

On his general form over the last year and a bit, I wouldn't read too much into his performances under Moyes - it's clear that a number of the players became really demotivated. I also think he was rushed back for the World Cup and is only just physically getting back to his best.

2751~~~
He's the best target man in the league imo which is one of the reasons I prefer to see him up top than Rooney.

2752~~~
Proved you haters wrong. Let's hope this continues. For those who demanded he'd be dropped for Wilson, no clue. World class player who was off form. Now his clinical boots are back on he will be banging them in.

2753~~~
He did say in the post match interview that he hasn't been too well fitness wise, but he's felt better the last few weeks. It'll be interesting to see whether he is back to his best or not.

2754~~~
I respectfully disagree. He scored 4 goals this World Cup, coming out of the "group of death", made an absolute mockery of one of the strongest Spanish sides in history, all while playing for a very mediocore side. Compare his World Cup goal scoring record to Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi, if you want to have a good laugh. It's interesting that people are willing to forgive Ronaldo's performances at the international stage, e.g., "he's out of form" or "coming back from injury", yet just a few short months after RVP manages to score MORE than Ronaldo and the same as Messi, who was playing with far better teammates, people are writing RVP off. Don't forget, RVP also scored against and defeated a very talented Brazil team to lead his team to 3rd place in the World Cup, coming from a team that is carried completely by RVP and Robben. Hardly a "poor" performance.

This excerpt really says it all (that RVP is continuing to perform at the highest level):

Van Persie ended the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign as top scorer in the UEFA section with 11 goals. In June 2013, he was appointed captain of the Dutch national team by manager Louis van Gaal. On 11 October 2013, he became the Netherlands' top goalscorer of all-time in an 8–1 defeat of Hungary, the Dutch's penultimate Group D match, where he scored a hat-trick. This put him on 41 goals in 80 internationals, surpassing the record previously held by Patrick Kluivert.
In the team's opening match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Van Persie captained the Netherlands to a 5–1 win over champions Spain in Salvador. He scored twice in the match, one of which was a flying header which was later nominated for FIFA Puskás Award for the most beautiful goal of the year. He was also named man of the match by FIFA. On 18 June, he scored his third goal of the tournament in a 3–2 defeat of Australia, a result that qualified the Netherlands to the knockout stage with one group match remaining.
In the quarter-final, Van Persie scored the Netherlands' first kick in a 4–3 penalty shootout defeat of Costa Rica. He scored his fourth goal of the tournament from a penalty kick in a 3–0 win against Brazil in the third-place play-off.

And the age thing really is overblown. RVP never relied on his pace, but more on his clinical finishing and vision and movement. Look at Drogba - he is very old now, but he still has that killer instinct to score goals.

2755~~~
It seems that many of us, including me, have written him off too early. Maybe LVG has been right to insist to play with him up front.

2756~~~
Yea especially when put up against big shithouse central defenders.

2757~~~
You could see over the last 2 or 3 games that his performances were improving and played well last night, playing only one game a week has given him the time to recover from the tiredness due to the WC- he also has the added incentive to keep his place with Falcao coming back into the picture

2758~~~
When his on form, there isn't a proper number 9 I'd have over him. Question is whether this is a sign of a proper return to top class performances or just a fleeting reminder of what he can do. Some of his play with back to goal was just sublime.

2759~~~
I don't think anyone hates him, he's pretty much liked by all United fans from what I've seen. Nothing to dislike about him, his form this season has just not been that good. Everyone would like to see him from yesterday's game more.

He can be our Bergkamp if we use him correctly. I don't think he should be playing every game though but with Falcao lacking fitness and Wilson lacking experience it could happen.

2760~~~
He's looked a lot fitter and sharper the last few weeks, before then his movement looked very stiff and he looked a bit like he was scared to sprint or strike the ball with any real power but in the past few games he's done it on a few occasions. I wonder if he's been carrying some sort of injury that wasn't serious enough to stop him playing but was affecting his explosiveness to a degree.

2761~~~
I can't shake the feeling that this will basically be the trend for him now, a really good game like the RvP of old followed by a poor one or two. I'm just not sure at the age of 31, after an injury plagued career and being overplayed the last few years, that he's capable of the consistency he used to be. That said, if we can grab us 20 goals this season I'll be delighted, and hopefully I'm wrong and he does kick on from here, because we saw last night just how much of a one man match winner the guy can be when he's at his best.

2762~~~
I wouldn't be that sure just yet. It was one good performance, with another decent one against Hull. I'd still like to see him put a few good games together. It's astonishing how fickle posters are with their opinions on players.

2763~~~
Physically he's looked as good as he's ever done if not more fitter. For example i've never seen him run so much and press like he did against Stoke last week. Physically he has proven over the last 3 games that his legs are far from gone. The only thing missing from his game recently was his technical brillance and he seems to have found that against Southampton. Players don't just lose their technical qualities, it was always a confidence issue.

People say injuries he has had in his career would take its toll but its the opposite really. Missing so many games in his career means he has more miles left in his legs. Robben was even more injury prone than Van Persie yet he is benefiting now from the time he has missed.

2764~~~
He was quite decent against Stoke too, seems to be running far, far harder than at the start of the season.

2765~~~
His post match comments were interesting. Made a point of saying how he is feeling really fit, physically, now. The implication being that he wasn't in the opening games of the season. That would be a really reassuring explanation for his poor start.

2766~~~
I was going to say this. I think a lot of players could have better and longer careers if they played less when younger. For example if Rooney had played less in his early 20s, he might not have lost as much of his pace by now, and he'd be an absolute force to be reckoned with. Obviously that doesn't happen to everyone - Ronaldo for example - but it does seem to happen to a big number of players.

2767~~~
Yeah he did seem very confident, although he always has been. I really, really hope that's the case and he kicks on from here. He could be the difference between top four and not. I don't think there's another game changer in our team as influential as an in-form RvP, Di Maria included.

2768~~~
In this form, you almost expect him to score in every game. He did look fit throughout the entire 90 mins yday.

2769~~~
Was quality last night in fairness. Especially the 2nd half. Hold up play was superb and deadly in front of goal.

2770~~~
You would alright but he'd have to be getting a lot more service than the few bit's and bobs he was getting here and there last night.

2771~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FnScGn5JbI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2772~~~
I'll put my hands up, I was calling for him to be dropped a few games ago as I thought he really penalized the overall play of the team, but he's turned it around big time and looks really fit. Excellent all round game for him last night.

2773~~~
Was outstanding last night. I had actually forgotten him at that level. Reminded me of his first season with us where we were basically cheating by having him in the team. In those days we just used to knock the ball in the general direction of him and let him get on with it. Was pretty much like that last night. He stole those points for us.

2774~~~
He definitely had a bit of bite back last night which helped. I remember him barging into one of their defenders off the ball which I thought was a good sign. He's hardly been in our games recently but  he seemed to want to get on the ball at every opportunity last night. Hopefully he keeps it up against the Scousers.

2775~~~
Well he shut me up. I was calling for him to be rested over the coming weeks. Jesus he was good today.

If you consider how shite we actually were and how shameful the service he got was, you gotta say that was close to a 10/10 performance. He didn't put a foot in wrong at all and worked extremely hard defensively as well. They couldn't touch him. And to score on both chances he had is brilliant.

He played like he did at the beginning of his first season for us. He even looked noticeably stronger and faster and worked harder than he has worked in a while.

2776~~~
Promising, indeed.

2777~~~
Nice. Always nice to put one's hands up and admit it. I'm going to head to the Fellaini thread to do likewise after reading this. 
I just wonder where the people who said "There is literally no hope for him if he doesn't play well against Arsenal" or "James Wilson DESERVES his chance" are now. Plenty of people were saying what you were saying, good on you.

2778~~~
I actually gave him my first 10/10 of the season in the post match ratings. Thought he was absolutely flawless last night.

2779~~~
It's only football and I have no problems admitting when I was mistaken about a player. And it's a nice feeling to do so when said player has had such a good game to be honest! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2780~~~
Yeah, I agree. But what you'll find in the most part on these forums is that people won't admit it. What they'll do is wait as long as they can, until the player next makes a mistake, then get in there and highlight it on his thread. If you look at Fellaini, it's happening on his thread now after a shambolic turnout yesterday.

2781~~~
Top lad! Classy!

2782~~~
He was fantastic, world class striker performance.

2783~~~
I am among those who insistently defended him and thought it was right LvG started him every game because I know he's the one who can pull off magic trick and boom, score. And he hasn't disappoint and I still keep faith in him. Last night he didn't only score two goals giving us the vital 3 points taking up to third in the table. He also played well overall and was the best player in the pitch. I believe he's such a quality player people writes him off at their perils. I have said it many times before and I am saying it again now.

2784~~~
If Van Persie can return to the sort of form that sees him put away virtually every chance he gets, we'll comfortably finish top 4 and will probably bite at the heels of the two above.

2785~~~
If he does continue this form, Di Maria will feed him Ronaldo-style. Di Maria would be on Cesc levels of assists by now, as he has put van Persie in for at least 2/3 chances in almost every game so far.

2786~~~
Have to say I've been wanting him dropped for ages but he's turning it round. Props to Van Gaal for sticking with him, what I'd initially taken to be a touch of sentimentalism may turn out to be brilliant management if Van Persie can keep it up.

2787~~~
Got to say I am one of those that has been one of those that's been thinking - ok he is done and time for him to go. However, not because of his 2 goals but, rather afterwards makes me want to have a word with myself. The way he went and sought that kid out to give his shirt and then just the way he genuinely was appreciative of the fans - very good to see from him.

2788~~~
Glad he's turning things around. We need him sharp against Liverpool. A 6th win in a row will be awesome.

2789~~~
On form he's our best player, even better than Di Maria, Falcao and Rooney. Against Southampton he was absolutely brilliant and won us the game like he used to. It's up to him now to keep his form up now, he's set the standard and he needs to play like that consistently.

Anyway he's coming into form at a brilliant time, hopefully he does the business against L'pool on Sunday!

2790~~~
His best performance of the season by a distance.

Interesting he said his fitness has gotten better last 2 weeks. Hope he can continue his form.

2791~~~
I was hoping that he'd get his confidence back, and he certainly did. He was looking like the van Persie I know with that excellent performance against Southampton. He looked fit, sharp, and at his best. His technique was top notch, and he made very good use of what little time he had with the ball. His two goals were also very much the sort of goals he would score when the team needed them.

Let's hope he continues on like this. The match against Stoke showed signs of him getting back to his best, and this match was where we saw the old Robin van Persie, the one we all love to see.

2792~~~
Looks much sharper on the ball. Good hold-up play leading up to Rooney's goal.

2793~~~
Yeah, thought that myself. He doesn't look as sluggish when involved as play as he had been for most of the season before the Southampton game.

2794~~~
So I assume everyone who's been dishing it out on RVP is quite quiet today?

What Phil Neville said before kick off made a ton of sense to me.

2795~~~
Definitely agree with you. He's not had much service, but he's not dwelling on the ball and he looks so much more stronger than earlier on in the season. He's even working hard defensively.

What did he say?

2796~~~
He will score one today I m sure. Been very lively.

2797~~~
"When you start the new season on the back of the hard and long season, and it wasn't a great season for Robin van Persie fitness-wise, with just 10 days off in pre-season to recover from going really far in the World Cup, it is impossible to recover in time. That is why Robin van Persie has started the new campaign so slowly."

2798~~~
great game by him.

2799~~~
He seems to be back. May it last longer.

2800~~~
He was fab. 

Worked his bollocks off today and deserved the goal.

2801~~~
He's back <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2802~~~
Superb again, and it does look like he was simply struggling for a bit of fitness early in the season.

2803~~~
Glad to see him playing some of his better stuff again.

2804~~~
Good performance, happy he's back

2805~~~
People saying he was past it <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Superb today. RVP of '12-13

2806~~~
The man is back.

Sorry I ever doubted you Robin. You genius you.

2807~~~
Got his swagger back. Came for the ball, won tackles and was a threat.

2808~~~
RVP's interview<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2809~~~
He admitted he got a touch for Mata's offside goal. "You can put that down as an assist!" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2810~~~
Brilliant performance from him today.

2811~~~
That is cheeky, he really wants to rub it in. Love it.

2812~~~
Last two performances have been 12-13 level. Brilliant stuff.

2813~~~
Football fans are hilarious. RVP was taking dogs abuse a week or two ago,

He has too much quality not to find his form again. LVG was right to keep playing him

2814~~~
I can hear the crickets from the posters who said he should be dropped and is past it.

Brilliant player and a must have in our starting 11.

2815~~~
Yeah, opinions have shifted here very quickly again. Same with a number of players since we started playing well. I was starting to doubt him myself admittedly, although I'm glad he's found his best form again.

2816~~~
Top stuff. Welcome back, Robin.

2817~~~
Oh how wrong was I about him. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

He's getting back to his best, that moment at the end where he protected the ball wanting to go forward under clear foul (can't remeber who it was) serves as proof of him getting his strenght back.

Him being ready is having world class striker capable of making difference out of nothing, long may it countinue!

2818~~~
Yep classic kneejerk. Did take him ages to get going this season though. So glad he is back.

2819~~~
I love that he is back. Worked hard each game and there was some good runs that the midfielders didn't see as well. Great game.

2820~~~
Loved that <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2821~~~
He was brilliant. A happy Van Persie is a dangerous animal. You could see how much he loved it in that interview.

2822~~~
Second match in a row where his off the ball work has truly impressed me, RVP looks much fitter and more involved than ever.

2823~~~

The looks he gives DDG, looks like he wants to take him home. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2824~~~
Hey RvP, keep this up and I'll start baking that humble pie! <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2826~~~
Will hold my hands up and say I was one of the doubters, I still feel my reaction had its cause at the time. But he has been excellent the last 2 games. Long may it continue

2827~~~
Van Persie is in his physical prime. His work rate was never this high and at times he looked rapid in the last three games especially when tracking back.

2828~~~
7 goals since the start of the season. 125% better return than Welbeck. For all those who wanted him sold instead of him.

In the last month he has been excellent most of the time.

2829~~~
Played well. I thought he dropped deeper at times in the second half to see more of the ball. Nice adjustment. If he's healthy-he starts.

2830~~~
He was developing a-lot of detractors on here which was laughable at times. Great player and clearly getting back to his best.

2831~~~
Glad he's back. That effort in the box, when he picked it out of the air <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2832~~~
Class interview, team spirit just seems so much better now.

2833~~~
It's brilliant to watch him in this kind of form. Still thought he was a notch or two better against Southampton but he'll be massive for us this season.

2834~~~
Outstanding.

2835~~~
The volley and the goal.

2836~~~
Deserved stick earlier in the season. Bad miss today (side footer from 5 yards) but nice goal and better second half. Seems a nice lad which helps.

2837~~~
Check the dates of the post before replying...

2838~~~
Pretty good prediction.

2839~~~
RVP of all people most likely knows what LVG would've done to them had they pulled a Leicester today. 

With that being said, good to have RVP back for good.

2840~~~
Looks like he can comfortably play 90 minutes now whereas a couple of months ago he had to be replaced after 60-70 minutes.

2841~~~
But but but....Welbeck.

2842~~~
We've got RVP back in top form. Makes me very confident of winning games.

2843~~~
Looks like Robin is back. Good finish, worked hard, and was constantly involved in our attacking play. Good game from Robin.

2844~~~
In this form he's one of the best 3, maybe 5, players in the league. I love that we have him, and long may this form continue.

2845~~~
When was the last time we had such an outspoken player in the team? I'm becoming a fan of his interviews. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2846~~~
RVP still top class.

2847~~~
I was highly critical of RVP, but man I can't be happier than I am now after he made me eat my words.

2848~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2849~~~
The world cup was really difficult for him, playing so many games and them only having a short break until the start of the season without an actual proper preseason. It was bound to happen! He just needed a little fitness and a good goal to get his confidence back and now he looks like coming back to his best.

2850~~~
He was written off far too early this season, great to see him getting back to his best.

2851~~~
That's what's so good about the threadmarks feature, you can just jump back and read posts like this from 3 weeks ago:

2852~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Oh yes perfect!

2853~~~
I hope I can keep quoting myself every week

2854~~~
That touch and volley was sublime. Shame he couldn't guide it either side of their keeper.

His work-rate was phenomenal too. It was great watching him sprint back to nick the ball from their midfield at 3-0 up.

Unrecognisable from the Van Persie of a few months back.

2855~~~
Still keeps looking for people to float the ball over his head from deep in the midfield but we keep passing it out wide. That really is his bread and butter and I wish we played that ball over him more often

2856~~~
Agreed- to be honest he was very poor for some time so the criticism WAS justified, I’m not feeling bad just because he is playing much, much better NOW.


Exactly. It seems regaining his fitness was key for him. Fantastic performance.

2857~~~
At the start of the season he looked weak physical; he was sluggish off the mark, he lost too many duels and looked tired. Now he outpaces one after another. Granted, Lovren is no Walcott, but the way that RVP chased him down the pitch and outsprinted him is something he would struggle with earlier in the season. His dribbles are better, his instincts look sharper and his passing is once again sublime. Terrific performance once again. If he keeps this up, we are in for a sweet spot in the league.

2858~~~
I think that's partly the result of Carrick being pushed further back and Herrera not playing from the start again. When we played Hull he had more through balls such as the goal and the saved headed chance that was marginally offside.

2859~~~
Spot on with everything there.

I seem to remember <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> had a theory that he was carrying a knock (although he and LVG denied it I think). But that would explain why he looked so sluggish, and physically weak for so long. That moment near the end today where he chased back and nicked the ball of a Liverpool player on the halfway like wouldn't have happened a month ago.

2860~~~
He had a fine game against Chelsea, was outstanding vs Southampton and was good again today against Liverpool. I thought he deserved to be dropped when he wasn't peforming but fiar play to him, he's shown his class against the best teams.

2861~~~
It's a little reminiscent of Evra a couple of seasons ago. Everyone could see that he carried a knock - he ran like an 85 year old. Ferguson said he was fine, but a few months later he said Evra had played great periods of the season with an injury in his foot, I believe it was. Just because they don't announce injuries don't mean they aren't there. RvP most likely played because we suffered so many injuries and options were too few and far between. Thankfully, he doesn't seem to struggle with anything these days. Didn't he have a similar chase back against Southampton as well near the 90th minute?

2862~~~
I didn't know De Gea can speak good English? It's a sign, he's staying!

2863~~~
love his interviews, knows how to speak in front of a camera, always funny and honest at the same time. Glad that he is back, i defended him at the beginning but lost my patience before the Southampton game. A pleasure to watch him when on form.

2864~~~
Aesthetically speaking, I don't think there is any other striker I could quite happily sit and watch videos of all day. He just plays football beautifully.

2865~~~
He deserved the criticism earlier on but he's got into form now and playing so well! Long may it continue and once our team is settled and plays better football, we will create much more chances for him

2866~~~
This 20 minute pre Liverpool interview is really, really good for anyone interested. Some of it was aired on TV earlier on today, <b>think you may have to have a Sky account just to warn you beforehand.</b> <b>Doesn't play on Chrome either.</b>

Talks about his form, stats, the systems, social media, Rooney and the season so far.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/watch/video/9606464/robin-van-persie-extended-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/watch/video/9606464/robin-van-persie-extended-interview</a>

2867~~~
Rolled back the years with his last two performances. Great to see.

2868~~~
I love how happy RVP looks after a win. His passion for the game always comes across during these interviews.

2869~~~
Is proving me wrong and credit to him. Hope he can keep it up. Maybe it was a fitness issue earlier in the season because he seems to be running out matches a lot better.

2870~~~
Rooney and Van Persie in great form, Falcao fit to start, ADM to come back in...things are looking up.

2871~~~
If he can keep up this form over the last 2 (just 2 games, lets not get ahead of ourselves), then maybe. Hopefully he keeps it up as he's been very good recently. Having an on form Van Persie up front, with Rooney next to him and Di Maria providing them (and others) can be amazing for us.

2872~~~
That little spell towards the end where nearly every single pool defender unsuccessfully tried to take the ball off him was great <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2873~~~
Hopefully he's back. I was starting to seriously worry as he was shite for a long time.

2874~~~
Maybe he learned English just to give us the respect of telling us he's leaving. Yes I am paranoid.

Is Van Persie the most excited, talkative and alround smiley player when it comes to interviews? Someone needs to tell him your supposed to say "yeah", "urmmmmm" and "unbelievable" in the post match in this country. Van Pesie just enjoys himself. He's a great man. Glad he's back firing, because a sad Robin makes me unhappy.

2875~~~
Class yesterday. He's getting it done. Great boost having him back.

2876~~~
I don't think there is a striker with better hold up play skills; something which was missing in the first few games this season. I just love his hold-up play and the way he plays around tight spaces. Welcome back, Robin van Persie.

2877~~~
The way he muscled off Steve Me was jizzworthy

2878~~~
That's the gayest way you could have possibly phrased that.

2879~~~
His service is still poor. Mata and others need to feed him more in or around the box. Before the assist against 'pool I cannot recall Mata ever giving RVP a shooting opportunity but at least there does seem to be some interplay between Rooney and RVP now.

2880~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2881~~~
Yesterday's performance was a world away from that "9 touches" offering last month. Seems to have his Mojo back. When you're winning there's no finer player to have in your team

2882~~~
That's all our attack was missing this season was an in form striker because we were adding goals from every area of the pitch except up front. No shame in wanting RVP dropped when he wasn't producing and you have the likes of Falcao on the bench but he's cemented his place in the starting XI for me with his last two performances.  Such a brilliant player and a joy to watch in form.

2883~~~
That dipping shot at 86 minutes against Liverpool was Bergkamp-esque.

2884~~~
His all round game is now so much better but I have to say his work rate has really impressed me. He doesnt give up and sprints back if necessary, it's great to watch

2885~~~
It was absolute class. I wish it had gone in, really deserved to be immortalised. It was even better when I saw it on MOTD later, I appreciated how good the shot was but I hadnt fully noticed how well he brought the ball under control just before taking the shot.

2886~~~
Would have been nice if Jones just got out of the way of that shot. He had been doing that all game but actually chose to be a goalkeeper at that particular moment <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2887~~~
G Nev made this point a few weeks back and I have actually noticed this a lot with Falcao as well that our midfield players don't look up enough to spot the runs from our strikers. Van Persie and Falcao can be so good for each other if other players could spot their runs

2888~~~
It'd be nice if Falcao can get fit enough to start with RVP consistently as he's found him on those runs quite a few times.

2889~~~
Yep.
Had that gone in, that'd be one of the best goals so far this season.

2890~~~
Van Persie won the best sporting moment of the year award in Holland.

RvP and Daley Blind had quite a cool moment on stage

2891~~~
It was wonderful. I honestly thought at one point that we wouldn't see that RVP ever again. I've never been go glad to be completely wrong, he's just a joy to watch when on his game.

2892~~~

My favourite ever United player. He's not even been here that long, but I just love RvP.

2894~~~

2895~~~
His interviews are always brilliant.

2896~~~
It was an absolutely gorgeous pass. Can anyone find that fans phone footage with an angle from just behind Blind? It really makes you appreciate it.

2897~~~
Thanks for posting mate. I didn't realise there was an interview, and a top one at that.

2898~~~
Great interview, thanx for posting!

2900~~~
Another great interview by him, hope he can regain his form, one of my favourite players to watch when he's on form.

2901~~~
He looks so bloody strange when he's clean shaved.

2902~~~

2903~~~
I love RVP, he's just a perfect fit for our club and sometimes I forget he played for Arsenal for so long. No doubt he had a bad patch and fitness issues for close to a year, but, on top of his game, I think he's still our best player. Hope he plays on for a few more years before retiring here (I guess he'll go back to Rotterdam though).

2904~~~
Don't understand why he came off at all- in good goal scoring form and when we need one he's sat on the bench looking on.

2905~~~
Missed quite a big chance early on. Came off too early though, we were building up some heavy momentum before he came off.

2906~~~
Taking him off today was just ridiculous. Judging from his reaction, he thought the same.

2907~~~
I feel it was a mistake to sub him out for Wilson.

2908~~~
How he was hooked off and Mata stayed on the pitch is a mystery.

2909~~~
5 minutes later we've a man advantage as well, probably frustrated him enormously seeing that. I don't have a problem with Wilson but if there's a good chance late on in the game I want it falling to Falcao or him.

2910~~~
Strange sub considering that he was close to scoring twice in the second half in the 15 min he played...

2911~~~
Yup, after all season of keeping him on, in a game where he looked fairly lively it was bizarre to see him off.

2912~~~
You all wanted him to be benched/subbed - now LVG did it, it's wrong and strange. Nice one lads, nice one.

2913~~~
Pretty much. Thought he played well

2914~~~
So in the opening weeks of the season I lost track of the number of times he should have been subbed off but wasn't, despite playing terribly. As soon as he hits some form, boom, early bath. Very odd.

2915~~~
In previous games we had Rooney suspended or Falcao injured which is probably why he played so much. Today we had ADM on the bench whilst RVP wasn't doing much and his strike partner had just scored. It made sense to me anyway. I thought bringing Wilson on was a crap decision, though.

2916~~~
His chance early in the 2nd half looked horrible on Match Of The Day; a simple square pass and Falcao walks the ball into the unguarded net (provided Falcao was on-side, looked ok but would have been close). His volley in the first half was impressive but unfortunately he wasted the better opportunities he got to score.

I didn't mind him being substituted at the time.

2917~~~
I didn't want him playing earlier in the season but he shouldn't have been taken off. Would have taken Mata off if I was LvG. Just watched that interview too, really enjoyed it. Thanks for posting it.

2918~~~
Almost as though his form affects opinions on whether or not he should play the full 90. Crazy, right?

2919~~~
I don't care. Everyone is Mr. Know all and Knee jerk here.

2920~~~
Have we ever had a more selfish player than him? Why he doesn't pass when other players (in most cases Falcao) are in better positions than him? Is he playing for the numbers of goals he'll score or for the team?

2921~~~
That's including you because your opinion sounds ridiculous.

Yes, people wanted him benched when he couldn't hit barn door if it was in front of him, not when we're chasing the score and he's scored 3 in 2 and looked the best from our strikers yesterday untill that Falcao goal.

2922~~~
That's fine. When he couldn't hit a barn door, we didn't have much in terms of an alternative, I never understood why many of you refused to see it then. Yesterday we had Falcao and so, LVG could afford to take him off. I don't think he was playing particularly well, and he missed a good opportunity too, Falcao had just scored -  thought he along with Mata should have been subbed off.

2923~~~
I thought did ok yesterday, can't score in every game. It wasn't an Arsenal type performance by any means he was involved in parts.

2924~~~
Right now there are about 3 in the attacking department.

2925~~~
Who?

2926~~~
This should be interesting...

2927~~~
Anyone else think that Van Persie is starting to mirror Ruud from 2005-2006. Excellent player, we're very grateful for what they did for United, quite productive but a bit static and in order to progress as a team we might need to get rid despite their good goal-scoring records ? Of course we don't have equivalent of a young Wayne and Ronaldo duo like then so it might be a more difficult transition long term but there has been a gradual degradation in terms of his performances and he's becoming increasingly one dimensional as opposed to the all-action focal point of attack he was through 2011-2013.

2928~~~
Thinking more like this with every day passing. I think that he slows our game and doesn't even try to pass to people when he can make a shoot on the goal.

If Falcao reaches a high level, then RVP should either go to bench or get sold IMO. If is the main point though, so far Robin has been better (well more fit) than Falcao.

2929~~~
Hmm not so sure tbh, some of the runs he makes our other strikers just don't make, shame we don't have enough brave midfielders to make the pass half the time. Its only really Di Maria, Blind, or Carrick that would even dare.
Jury is out on Falcao though, as I see him making similar runs and no-one passing to him... sigh

EDIT: In a game where we're getting the ball wide and relying on wide man, Young and Valencia to create something, he isn't really going to shine as we saw last season

2930~~~
Christiano rollaroundo comes to mind.

2931~~~
Yup, to be fair to Robin he has been making a lot of intelligent runs so it's not just his fault. 

But even considering that, is relying on a a player who's becoming more restricted like a pure #9 the best course of action for the future ? Most of the elite clubs like United have a more balanced and complete striker who stretches defenses, presses the defenses on a consistent basis, physically holds up the ball well and contributes not just in terms of goals but being a foil for the other attackers to move around.

PSG has Ibrahimovic, Real has Benzema who while not the most productive striker does contribute a lot to their overall play, Bayern with Lewandowski, City with Aguero and so forth. Those players are just more dynamic I feel so even if they don't score themselves they can make up in other ways. With Robin there's a trend of him getting more desperate (?) when he doesn't score because he has more limited options to directly influence the game as opposed to some of the strikers mentioned above.

Dunno, perhaps I'm being hypercritical but Robin seems to be becoming more and more like Raul or Ruud when they turned 30+ and their ability to remain consistent for a whole season dropped..

2932~~~
ADM by a certain distance, and Mata and Falcao.

2933~~~
I was disappointed that he was taken off. Even if he isn't having his best game, there is a chance that he would get you a winner.

2934~~~
RvP made a lot or great runs yesterday and wasn't picked up for any of them.

Having said that he missed a great chance early on and should have scored later on when he hit it straight at Guzan.

If I was LvG, I'd swap RvP and falcaos position from yday. Play falcao further up and drop RvP (positionally). I think we'd see a bit more from both players.

2935~~~
Di Maria gets at times on shooting mode from any position, but he doesn't waste chances like RVP does by refusing to pass the ball.

Mata is nonsense IMO, he usually goes for the pass even when he is on a good position to shoot (for example like the assist to RVP against Liverpool). And Falcao generally passes the ball immediately when he receives it.

Probably, but is really close.

2936~~~
Are you kidding

2937~~~
You maybe right, but you didn't need to put the Benzema not being the most productive, he is actually VERY productive <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

I don't liken RVP to those types of strikers though, he has never been that type of player. It depends how we want to play, plus if we're playing with 2 up top I think it helps to have someone like him i.e a Bergkamp/Sherringham type player.

2938~~~
If the shot was such a waste of a chance, it implies that he should have taken the shot anyway. The defender did well to nudge him off balance. The same as with the Falcao chance in the first half, he could also have done something different with it. I don't blame him, because strikers have to strike, and can't score if they can't miss, and they can't assist when they can't take the risk of an intererception. Mata, not beeing a striker, should more often look for the third man and not aiming for the assist or shot all the time. 

I don't think it's a coincedence that Villa bounced back from the ropes after Van Persie was taken off, because a lot of his movement makes space for others and he often is there to keep the posession and attacks going. 

There's a lot of eagerness here to blame Van Persie, didn't the humble pie of the last weeks go down well and now it's coming all out again?

2939~~~
Err, I have been one of his biggest fans on the last two seasons and defended him when a lot of people were talking bad for him last season.

I also didn't ever said that he doesn't create space for the others with his movement. What I was saying is that he has been very selfish this season, and generally tries to shoot even if the other players (especially Falcao) are in far better positions. At times he scores (like he did against Leicester?) despite that wasn't in a great position while Falcao was completely free and at times loses chances (like yesterday when he could have easily passed to Falcao). I mean he went crazy when Wilson didn't pass to him a few weeks ago, but he does the same every week.

If Rooney sees that an another player is on a better position, he passes the ball. Regardless that he could improve his goal stats by shooting. It is in the end a team game, and this season it looks to me that RVP is more interested in his stats rather than the team.

2940~~~
The question was more selfish players right? And you're saying di maria, falcao and mata? Ignoring that 2 of them are our supposed to be our main creative players, di maria does dribble past players and have shots from range but he does it to open up space and make a chance, is definitely not him being selfish as he isn't a selfish player at all. Mata never takes players on on his own and rarely shoots so that's ridiculous, and Falcao is a poacher who usually passes the ball right away. Van Persie is definitely our most selfish player, but that's not a big thing to say as he isn't very selfish himself, for the type of striker he is.

2941~~~
I'd say Di Maria is more selfish, or at least rivals RvP in that regard. Don't agree with Mata and Falcao though.

2942~~~
Totally agree with you. The problem is that RVP has not being getting enough service and the recent games in which he scored were more about his anticipation and intelligence. So now that he has not scored people are writing him off again. The amount of times Mata has passed to him n an attacking situation you can literally count on one hand. Rooney, however, does seem to look for him more now but still not enough.

2943~~~
The only reason why LVG might have taken him off was to rest him for Friday and Sunday

2944~~~
He needs Carrick in midfield. He's the only one who consistently sees his runs. Clearly he prefers crosses from deep midfield, rather than crosses from the byline

2945~~~
RvP played well I thought, pity he got taken off as Gabby soon after got sent off and RvP would have been the ideal player to put pressure on Villa then. Really shouldn't have been subbed.

2946~~~
This was our biggest mistake in the game I think. Sure, a lot of players failed to turn up and switching Young to the side where he was not dangerous (at all) was poor, but taking RvP off killed the game for me. The man has a knack for scoring, especially when we're up again 10 men and there is more space available for him to do his thing.

2947~~~
Just so it doesn't get overlooked, he's done great job for the first goal. Dragged Coloccini out of his zone which left Rooney with enough space to put it in. 

LVG must be happy for those goals scored, total football with great team work there.

2948~~~
Encouraging to see him and Falcao already striking up an understanding with their runs. They are dragging the centrebacks all over the shop. Its not a coincidence that Rooney got two open shots in the box by simply running forwards.

2949~~~
Good to see him and Falcao going on opposite directions to open up Newcastle defense. Really good understanding of their position n this game

2950~~~
Yes. It looks like their runs crisscross all the time. Still think Mata is missing too many opportunities to deliver a through pass in dangerous positions to RVP.

2951~~~
Keep floating balls over him, centrally from midfield, and he'll keep scoring from them all day long. He probably makes a minimum of ten drool worthy runs each half. Need to use those better

2952~~~
His movement is exceptional. I've noticed that Mata with the exception of the Liverpool goal never seems to want to pass to Robin

2953~~~
Definately it what he does best.I think it was Carrick first game back that he gave RVP 3 or 4 overhead balls.Didn't get a goal that day but he needs to start doing it more.

2954~~~
Noticed this too, there was one time today where it was extra blatant. RvP was completely open in a great position but Mata tried a 1/10 pass for someone else. Maybe Robin got him a shit christmas present.

2955~~~
Good movement and a nice header to cap off a good diplay today.

2956~~~
Funny what a bit of confidence does for strikers. Looks a completely different player from the start of the season.

SAF was right the WC probably took a lot out of him

2957~~~
Starting to hit his stride now, said on the podcast if he can play most of the games this season he'll get at least 20.

2958~~~
Good display, still missed a good chance when he went around the keeper, should have slotted that in.

2959~~~
Yup, I was backing him to score that one

2960~~~
The intelligence and composure of the 3 forwards was just absolutely delightful. No more coming back from games and saying "We created a ton of chances but couldn't score" with this bunch. Love the efficiency.

2961~~~
Wasn't it was few months back when Rooney got accused of not passing the ball to RVP? Now its Mata turn? He was running with the ball at full pelt and it was a split second decision. On another day he would have passed to RVP.

2962~~~
He just makes a lot of good runs, his movement is exceptional. They can't pass to him every time. 

With him and Falcao(who also has very good movement) in the team the opposite defenders are all over the place. It was the main reason why Rooney found so much space coming from deep today. I think this trio has the potential to be outstanding, once the get used with each other.

2963~~~
don't think he was any special but got his goal which is important even he missed another sitter later on

2964~~~
I think it was the other way round, RvP not passing it to Rooney. It was the easiest and best option for Mata who instead tried an impossible pass to imnotsurewho, that's why one might find it a bit strange. Any striker would be fuming with Mata for not setting them up in such a position. It's probably nothing though.

2965~~~
Nice, clever finish by RVP, but the ball from Rooney....<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2966~~~
Today showed the big difference between him now and him at the beginning of the season. In a game where he wasn't greatly involved, everything he did contribute oozed class. From the way he brought the ball down to his first-touch and passing, it all seemed so incredibly effortless and was, in general, faultless.

2967~~~
Rooney's assist to RvP two seasons ago was still the best.

Get in... Kagawa got the assist for the assist (madwinger lol)

2969~~~

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/agFgbpSw91k?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2971~~~
Robin and Radamel are not yet on the same page, but the job got done today.

2972~~~
One thing I noticed today and also in other home matches is that teams at OT, when they go down, they are not searching for a goal.
Today we scored 3, yet Newcastle were not throwing bodies forward.
If we can have a team (who goes 3 down) and begins to attack hard and leave gaps in defence, we can score 4 or 5.
But when a team seems content to lose 3-0 and parks the bus, this makes it difficult for us to score lots of goals.

2973~~~
It is incredible what fitness - or lack of - can do to someone. He isnt dead tired on his legs after 30 minutes of football and he finally is starting to make those deadly runs. That WC really costed him 3 months of this season. Very good to see him reaching form, and his technique<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>, worth going to the stadium for.

2974~~~
I don't even think it was solely World Cup, he also got that injury against Olympiakos a few months before and was battling against time to be fit for it which meant he needed extra time to start the season.

2975~~~
Didn't watch the game today, but I've always felt the two have had great chemistry, despite limited playing time alongside each other.

2976~~~
Was impressed with RvP. His little runs and his movement were quality.

2977~~~
Falcao and him will do better / understand each other better as the season goes on. Yesterday, they often made the same runs and could not find each other when they wanted to. Hope they pick it up - the potential for a partnership is definitely there

2978~~~
Yes his movement is exceptional, at the very least it creates space for teammates which was shown in the first two goals

2979~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OHHvp1DI2z5/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

2980~~~
He should calm the feck down in the warm up, what if that hit Dave's face?

2981~~~
And yet in the actual game he pulled out of one volley and miskicked another. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2982~~~
Good game again. Very funny to see how much his confidence and fitness have grown. Seems to do well in assisting Falcao as well, by taking on defenders and creating all sorts of trouble with his runs. Shame he missed the chance when he got that one on one.

2983~~~
I doubt he'll ever stop making those runs, it really is his trademark. With Rooney in midfield I think we'll see more of these.

2984~~~
He's a wanker. Almost injured De Gea.

We always thought that it is Jones who injures players in the training, but it looks to be Van Persie. He maybe hit Di Maria with the ball so hard that Di Maria couldn't play yesterday.

2985~~~
Our seventh best player of 2012-2013 season. That shouldn't be forgotten to get mention.

2986~~~
I remember him receiving the ball in a similar position during the actual game, and missing his kick completely. 

It was one of two 'What the f*cking hell was that moments?', along with when Mata just fell over for no reason while dribbling the ball in the final third.

2987~~~
Hi s movement throughout the WC and this season has always been very good but it is up to his midfielders to spot it and deliver him the ball. Robben and Sneijder were not good providers during the former and neither were Mata and Rooney ( during the first few games ). RVP is bound to develop arthritis in his shoulders as a result of his constant waving while trying to signal to his teammates that he is free.

2988~~~
He's and Falcao's running off the ball is actually outrageous! If only we had Iniesta or Pirlo in midfield <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2989~~~
We have Michael Carrick. Once Blind is back to relieve Carrick of some of his defensive duties, he'll be picking them out. Rooney too.

2990~~~
How long can he be an United player for? I just  watched an interview with Geoff Shreeves and he said he wants to play top level for the next 8-9 years. He's 31 now and his game doesn't rely on pace so I believe he can play into his mid thirties anyway. Zlatan is a fine example age 33.

2991~~~
Don't worry, it was only Lindergaard in net.

2992~~~
8 goals for the season nowl.

2993~~~
Not having his little juggling act in front of Lloris, that was on a plate he could've toe poked it straight passed Lloris first time. Poor finishing today. Had more than one chance and never really looked like scoring. Big let down.

2994~~~
Another bunch of big game sitters missed by him.

Please nobody tell me he is a better finisher than Rooney.

2995~~~
Terrible finishing. Back to dwelling on the ball around the final third too.

2996~~~
Today aside, he's scoring goals again but I'm still not all too impressed with the rest of his game. We're a little too one-paced at the top of the field.

2997~~~
All round a good game, but he should have buried that chance pretty much always.

2998~~~
I'll never understand why he does that when it's clear he sees his teammates and blatantly refuses to pass it to them.

2999~~~
I don't care that he missed that chance. It hurt us, but these things happen.

What I don't fecking udnerstand is why he doesn't pass the ball to our other attacking players. That is - in Drogba's own words - a fecking disgrace.

3000~~~
Should have scored, on another day he would have. Great control to bring the ball down though.

3001~~~
Looking back to the RVP of old

3002~~~
Ran out of gas a bit in the second half. Was very good in the first with his holdup and linkup play. Should have had a goal and made some delightful runs which Carrick picked out superbly.

3003~~~
Obviously he should score that chance in the first half, had a quiet game apart from that but his link play wasn't as good as normal. Him and Falcao were nowhere to been in the last half an hour.

3004~~~
Totally non existent in the second half. Maybe didn't help that there was nothing to feed off from.

3005~~~
For all the shit Falcao is getting in his thread RvP wasn't much better, both wasted the chances that fell to them and RvP picked the wrong pass on a couple of occasions.

3006~~~
Very frustrating today.

3007~~~
Pretty terrible today too. I'm going to put it down to fatigue and hoping that he's not reverting to the old RVP again.

3008~~~
I'll say it over and over again...he is past it.  Only gonna get worse next year.  You simply cannot be that slow and laborious in the PL.  I think it's funny how everyone thought we had the best strike force around...but now our best forward is playing midfield (quite well though) and our two strikers look past it.  Falcao not worth the money at this point.  Time is running out for him.

3009~~~
Very disappointed with him in this match...

3010~~~
Someone should remind him that taking an extra touch that close to goal is criminal. On that 1v1 chance he missed, either you smash it first time or you bulldoze your way in with a charging header.

3011~~~
cannot stress this enough, we have an attack that is based heavily on reputation rather than performances, which is quite unfortunate to say the least

3012~~~
Co-leading the team with 8 goals this season.  Sure, he had a bad game today; against Villa LvG was getting killed for substituting RvP, as he was our in-form striker.

3013~~~
I thought he played quite well. Two bad misses (especially the one in the second half) but his all-round game was sharp enough. Cnut of a referee gave him no protection either.

3014~~~
He is looking better now, but still not the lethal top striker RVP.

If it was RVP at his best then he gets 2 or 3 goals this game.

3015~~~
Agree with this. Currently, after 19 games, we have the 4th best goals for record, and the 4th best goals against.

3016~~~
Have to agree. Based on this season's performances, neither RVP or Falcao should be starting.

3017~~~
We have an attack who have scored a very good number of goals from the chances we actually create. Today was the exception as we have been very efficient in front of goal of late. Our problem in scoring goals is the laborious way we pass the ball around at the back.

3018~~~
His performance wasn't bad but he's just not at a clinical striker. For someone so good, he always misses an awfully high number of sitters. Nowhere as good a finisher as Rooney. Neither is Falcao at the moment though.

3019~~~
He is moving around well, his finishing is just not there. But neither is Falcao's, who was worse than him today and it's not as if we have many options left.

3020~~~
We score three at home and we have the best strike force in the league.  Two days later the same exact team gets shut out and RvP along with Falcao should be sent to the glue factory. Makes sense.

3021~~~
This place is rather knee-jerk.

3022~~~
<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/xKTne5w-lu/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

He posted this on his Instagram. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3023~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3024~~~
To be honest, he is still missing important chances quite regularly, despite improving his all round game from the beginning of the season. Even with than under consideration, there's only really been 2 or 3 games in which he's played like the RvP of old, one of them being against liverpool in which he was fantastic. His finishing has generally been poor until now by his standards and his performances not consistent whatsoever. I would have him moved on at the end of the season if it were up to me or at least not playing as a starter.

3025~~~
His composure was non existent

3026~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3027~~~
He knows he fecked up today, he even posted a insta photo of himself falling over after that 1v1 against Lloris.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Above

3028~~~
Well at least he's honest <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3029~~~
I have been very critical of RVP this season but I thought he was alright in this game. Yes, should have scored and could have done better in a few situations but I thought the effort and the intent was there, just didn't happen for him. That's life.

3030~~~
There are far too many ridiculous posts in this thread. We missed a ton of chances against Spurs, it was just one of those days. People are so over the top when we fail to win a game.

3031~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I like that.

3032~~~
Thought his overall holdup play/target man was good. Bad day at the office in terms of finishing.

That Instagram pic <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3033~~~
I thought he was decent - finishing aside. Better than Falcao I thought.

3034~~~
Totally agree. I get confused with the amount of love Falcao gets and the willingness to jump on Van Persie after a poor game. Not one game this season has Falcao performed well enough for me to say "bench RVP, play El Tigre". Yes, he's had a nice few assists but his touch has been awful, has had barely any shots, and while his movement has been good so has Van Persie's so he is not adding much to the team (say what you want about Van Persie's finishing lately, but his movement has been excellent). I really hope we can get the Van Persie - Falcao partnership up and running -- and glimpses of it has shown -- but I'm so much more confident of Van Persie turning the corner than Falcao.

3035~~~
RVP has played poorly enough at times this season to warrant that statement.

To be fair to him though, he has improved greatly over the past month.

3036~~~
I think he's one of the most selfish players we've had. Not saying its bad - but not very useful when we are playing two no.9s

3037~~~
I'd argue that when people we saying that, it was because we hadn't seen Falcao play yet so were basing our opinions of him based on his pre-injury best, which evidently he has not come near recapturing. If we knew then what we've seen now, people might be less inclined to bench RVP so quickly when his backup isn't as good as previously made out to be. 

I do agree though that the RVP at the beginning of the season was playing poor enough to justify questioning his place in the first 11.

3038~~~
Definitely. He will score next match and become great again.

3039~~~
He's clearly knackered. Man's been playing like almost every game for us this season.

3040~~~
Against Aston Villa he was substituted and everyone was going to kill LVG, today he missed some great chances and he's past it.

3041~~~
What has pissed me about him for a while now is, how slow the game becomes, literally at walking pace when he gets the ball, there are plenty of times during the counter he gets the ball on the wing with several players making runs of him, he constantly ignores them and then passes it back to a defender. Its extremly difficult for us to play counter attacking football with him, he ruins every single counter like this. I thought his overall play was good, missed plenty of good chances, but there are days as a striker nothing goes for you it seemed like the kind of day for him.

3042~~~
Don't get why he's not coming deep rather than Falcao? Or they not even switching.

3043~~~
Falcao shouldn't come deep that often either. We struggle enough to get balls behind them as it is, we could be more dangerous with two strikers up top making runs.

3044~~~
Apart from doing well in putting pressure on the Stoke defender resulting in the the corner that led to the goal he hasn't been seen much in that first half at all.

3045~~~
Clearly he is playing at the point of our attack which is what LVG said would happen, with Falcao playing off him a bit deeper.

Not much service for him today but he has been active and making some decent runs. With the conditions the way they are it will be difficult to play him in with balls over the top. Maybe with the switch in direction for the second half we will fare better.

Him and Falcao are building a decent understanding together.

3046~~~
Only had 6 touches in the half, none inside Stoke penalty area

3047~~~
It really looks like we're going to have an RvP who will look excellent one game and have two games following at this standard.

3048~~~
Still one half to play!

3049~~~
Was absolute gash today. Why Falcao went off instead of him I don't know.

3050~~~
No change.

3051~~~
Astute observation <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3052~~~
About the only thing he does right these days is those angled runs off the last defender for the ball over the top, contributes nothing else.

3053~~~
No service at all. Not surprising he struggled. Rooney doesn't create enough as a midfielder and most of his runs go ignored because no one has the guts to try a risky pass. The one time it worked we nearly scored.

3054~~~
Correct. Him and Falcao had nothing to work with, would have been a superb goal if he'd scored that flick.

3055~~~
This. Clearly need the midfield to see his run. Very often he was making runs and we keep passing the sideways or backward.

3056~~~
Very true, he wasn't good but he isn't helped at all by the midfielders' reluctance for a killer pass.

3057~~~
Rooney seems too happy to keep things ticking over with the odd cross field pass and lack of killer pass to a striker. That's one of the reasons I don't like seeing him in midfield. Mata is the same sometimes but against Tottenham and Newcastle he was much better at creating openings.

3058~~~
Lack of service from the wings. We just weren't able to get behind the stoke defence often enough.

We were missing someone like Di Maria to provide pace and service to RVP.

3059~~~
What's with this 'no service' fed to him excuse?

His 1st season with us, he scored many of the goals all on his own, some half chances even...

It's clear he has regressed. Age had caught up with him

3060~~~
Thought he should have went off for Falcao but he did have a nice effort which was unlucky to sail wide. Not really involved

3061~~~
Didn't see much of the 2nd half but I saw he got one half chance off a Mata cross pass, I don't think him and Falcao are truly comfortable as a pairing given they have similar leading the line tendencies.

3062~~~
Subdued but a great effort from Mata's pass, would have been an amazing goal.

3063~~~
How he is he supposed to make chances for himself or score if he's not given the ball by the midfield? There's only so much you can do in that situation and it's not as if he's not making the runs (which may have been a fair criticism earlier in the season). There's loads of times he's stood asking for the pass on the shoulder of the last defender but the midfielders play it safe and spray it out wide to Young or Valencia or turn back and keep possession instead. He basically had two 'half chances' the entire game today and he almost scored with one which would have been an amazing finish. 

I'm not saying it was good performance today but he's being let down at times by others around him.

3064~~~
Anonymous today apart from the moment when he chested the ball down and almost scored. Not good enough looks like the Rvp of the start of the season is back.

3065~~~
Rubbish again only seems to be playing because he's one of lvg favourite. I know this is bad thing to say but I hope he is injured because it's the only way he will get dropped.

3066~~~
He had zero chance and showed his frustration by making that stupid tackle.

3067~~~
Nonsense. No striker at this club is going to do better with the shite he was given to play with today.

3068~~~
Nonsense. He put Di Maria clean through twice. Not his fault that he gets the worse service in the league.

3069~~~
Yep, had one shot on target blocked he could have done better with but he combined with Di Maria for a few chances and his hold up play was mostly fine. The service to him has been sub par pretty much all season, can't do much if he's making the runs but people won't find him.

3070~~~
Must have been injured. I don't see why he would be take off otherwise.

3071~~~
Rooney has been more productive than him and he hasn't even been playing as a striker. RVP has been getting off very lightly this season, compared to the criticism Falcao and Mata have been getting. Think that's 8 goals in 20 appearances, any other striker would have been dropped by now with that sort of record at United.

3072~~~
For the umpteenth time this season that was a nothing performance. I'd flog him as soon as possible. Laborious, blowing out of his arse and a detriment to desired dynamic football. He and Rooney still cancel eachother out yet we still persist on cramming them both into the side.

3073~~~
From BBC: "More bad news for Manchester United. Striker Robin van Persie is to have a scan on a damaged ankle that forced him to limp off against Southampton."

3074~~~
Van Persie has been getting slaughtered on here this season. Unlike the others he has a little pedigree to fall back on at Utd. He's been living on scraps. How did Rooney do up front today?

3075~~~
Look the original point, which is the guy needs to be dropped which you originally refuted, the guy is clearly not performing and his numbers are showing it too, so why should we persist with him? Rooney only played 20 odd minutes upfront, if he had the minutes RVP has had this season uptop he would be outscoring and outperforming him. Besides that my opinion is based on his performances all season not just today.

3076~~~
We play with two strikers. It should be Rooney and Van Persie. Today isn't the first day we've barely created a chance. It's been a common theme throughout the season. None of the strikers have done as well as you'd like but instead of whining about how Van Persie is 'undroppable' I'd say it's more pertinent to be concerned with why great strikers are struggling to get chances.

3077~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3078~~~
Maybe he's not just good enough anymore?

3079~~~
All three? RVP, Rooney and Falcao are not good enough anymore?

3080~~~
Not sure how anyone could criticise him today. The poor fella was completely starved of service.

3081~~~
Oh feck off. He stays injury free all season and just when everyone's back from injury him of all people goes out injured.

3082~~~
At least it'll be one less striker to cram into the side.

3083~~~
All the forwards have struggled up top this season, the formation basically means they have to either feed off scraps or it's imperative they take their only chance. 

The forwards are not getting the service they should be getting.

3084~~~
we are playing 3 centre forwards together and they just cant play together with absolutely no support from the wings or through the middle. They cant create for themselves.

3085~~~
Fingers crossed for a return to 433 or the diamond.

3086~~~
Based on that season 5 years ago aye? RVP has been one of our better players in the past month. We create less chances than 16 other prem teams. It's diabolical the lack of service our strikers are getting just now.

3087~~~
If he is injured, we won't miss him at all in this system. Might even be a good thing if it forces Rooney further forward.

3088~~~
Poor performance but I can't help but wonder if we actually made a mistake in taking him off. He doesn't need many chances to score and you don't always have to play well to score a goal.

3089~~~
Yep, away to Southampton we created one chance and RVP scored 2 goals. That's how tough it's been for him recently. We just don't create anything, because half of the team are too slow and ponderous in possession.

3090~~~
[QUOTE="Orton, post: 16957671, member: 19613"<b>]Based on that season 5 years ag</b>o aye? RVP has been one of our better players in the past month. We create less chances than 16 other prem teams. It's diabolical the lack of service our strikers are getting just now.[/QUOTE]

Based on this seasons form.

3091~~~
Why isn't Falcao afforded these excuses then? People have already written him off and he hasn't even played half the minutes RVP has.

3092~~~
I'm not writing Falcao off yet, he's suffering too. His hold up play and touch are currently way off though, and that's something RVP surpasses anyone in our team at.

3093~~~
Tbh glad he's injured, hopefully will mean Rooney out of midfield & back up front, where he should be! 
We have midfield options now with Fellaini, Blind, Carrick, ADM, Mata, Fletcher & Herrera all available. No more excuses & please no more 352.

3094~~~
Yea, or simply he'll throw Falcao or Wilson in Robin's place and feck all will change.

3095~~~
Maybe so, but just look at the Falcao thread and all the hate he's getting. As for RVP this season he's been slowing play down especially on counter attacks when he gets the ball by dwelling on it then just passing it back to the midfield/defence, i have to disagree that his hold up play has been good.

3096~~~
Maybe. I'll wait until United create more than one or two chances a game before coming to that opinion or wishing one of our own players be injured.

3097~~~
The slow play is all over the team right now, and their hesitancy on the ball. RVP actually played a couple of quality balls over to Di Maria today, and he's been forced to drop deep so many times because the defence and midfield just go sideways and and backwards, like they are allergic to playing down the middle. It's infuriating but it's obviously a problem deeper than the strikers themselves and more to do with the core of the team. Players out of position is certainly not helping, but the lack of footballing ability in some of our players and how they cope when getting closed down is unacceptable. We have no dynamism in the middle and it hurts. Di Maria is obviously the man to offer it, and Herrera is an attacking minded box to box midfielder. We could do with actually playing them in midfield.

3098~~~
It's better than fielding players that are 'favoured'.
I hope you are right, RVP on form is a brilliant striker but i don't think that player of 2 seasons ago is there anymore.

3099~~~
He scored 18 in 28 last season and we were playing worse then, and the season before when he fired us to the title we were hardly a side that oozed creativity, efficient yes but creative is debatable, there was a lot of individual brilliance when he made a lot of goals out of nothing then, that seems to have stopped.

3100~~~
Subbed due to an ankle injury apparently.  To think we had a small glimmer of hope that our injuries were over and since our last match we lost RVP and Falcao <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3101~~~
I don't think Falcao was injured, he was just left out.

3102~~~
I'm glad. Distasteful, perhaps, but I've had enough of seeing he and Rooney hold the team back. Get Rooney in his place, at least he'll trouble the defenders with a modicum of movement and pace.

3103~~~
I actually thought he was alright before getting subbed. It wasn't a great performance but he didn't get a lot of service. Won the ball back a few times and also had one of our best chances blocked.

3104~~~
He was alright. Ddn't get much service but when he had the ball he used it fairly well.

Being glad about his injury is just disgraceful.

3105~~~
'glad he's injured' posts. 

This place is horrible sometimes.

3106~~~
Happy he's injured? Oh come on Caf, FFS.

Whether RvP is fit or not, playing the 3-5-2 lies SOLELY at the door of the manager. It has nothing to do with strikers being fit or not.

We had the perssonel to go 4-4-2, 4-3-3, hell, even 6-4-0, but LvG chose the 3-5-2.

Let's not cross that line, celebrating an injury to our own.

3107~~~
Thought he was poor, but then again, he got very little service The 352 (which is basically 5122) needs to die now. Neither Rooney nor Mata are CM's and it really shows against teams who know how to defend

3108~~~
I'm obvuously not pleased he's injured but am very close to not being bothered. Not bothered when our first choice striker all season gets injured. Shows what a horrible season we're having, no matter what the league table says.

3109~~~
Shame to hear about the injury, I think he has been performing decently in recent weeks. Really needs service and he just isn't getting it at the moment.

3110~~~
Terrible news with the injury. He is our only striker with a good first touch and hold up play. 

He has sorely missed Carrick's and Gigg's ability to spot his runs and make those pin point passes to him from the midfield. My theory is that he is a good striker in the wrong team/system rather than him being on a decline.

3111~~~
How long is he out for? Will be a big miss. He's the only proper CF we have in the team and is superb with his back to goal.

In fairness, he's had the chances this season. Just not taken them which is not very unusual for him.

3112~~~
Any update? It's been 48 hours.

3113~~~
"Glad he's injured" isn't quite fair. Glad LVG might be forced to try something different is fair enough. If it forces him to put Rooney up front or play Falcao on his own with an extra midfielder it could be a blessing in disguise.

3114~~~
No one ever passes to him, Mata 9/10 times passes sideways when RVP is running into the box, happened quite a few times against Southampton. We create about 2 chances a game so it's no wonder he hasn't scored much.

However earlier in the season he had loads of 1v1's he squandered.

3115~~~
According to Squawka's stats (only have this season and 2 previous seasons), non-penalty shots/attempts inside the box conversion rate (goals scored from non-penalty shots inside the box): RVP 15.5% this season. Last season 17%. His first season at United 20%. Falcao is currently 18.7% (smallish sample due to limited mins on pitch). In his final season at Athletico he was at 23% (8 pens made a big difference to his goal tally). In France prior to his injury 24%.

Mata (takes very few shots inside the box) but converts at 25% this season, 23.5% last season. Rooney is at an incredible 38.8% this season, last season 16%, the previous season 22%.

Departed United strikers Welbeck 22.5% last season (10% in PL this season, much higher in the CL). Hernandez last season 22%. The previous season 27%.

Figures for star strikers: this season Diego Costa 30%. Harry Kane 28.6%. Ronaldo 32%. Last season Sturridge 26.6%. Suarez 23%.

Figures for seemingly ordinary strikers: Berahino 20% Ulloa 24% Charlie Austin 20% Cisse of Newcastle is interesting as his figures fluctuate wildly from astonishing to inept 38% this season 2.5% last 11% the season before.

Obviously there are several other aspects of a forwards play that are worth taking into consideration, not just their ability to finish chances. Kun Aguero for instance is converting at around 19% yet taking an incredible average 5 shots inside the box per match. Having said that, it is not clear from the data, what RVP is meant to be good at currently (staying fit and getting selected ?) as Hernandez's stats from last season are superior in terms of assists, completed passes and chances created. Falcao is doing well at providing assists for us; something which was almost totally absent from his game in his final season in Spain.

Shooting from outside the box is a low percentage play unless it is a direct free-kick or the keeper's sight is blocked by other players (Daley Blind and Rooney both scored this season as the keeper couldn't see the shot). This season RVP has taken 6 shots from outside the box (scoring 1) compared to 45 from inside the box.

3116~~~
Guardian saying he's looks to be out for QPR but should be fit for Cambridge if van Gaal wants to play him.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/14/robin-van-persie-injury-miss-qpr-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jan/14/robin-van-persie-injury-miss-qpr-manchester-united</a>

3117~~~
He trained today so he will probably be fit for QPR

3118~~~
Hopefully he's fit for QPR.

3119~~~
Maybe van Gaal will use him as sub then. Remember last season when van Persie was rushed back by Moyes because 'what would you all think of me'? He ended up being out for another month around December/January when the fixtures were piling up.

3120~~~
That pic was from last week...Pereira reused it.

3121~~~
The number of times hes saved our skin the past few seasons is remarkable for fans to be saying they are glad he's injured.

3122~~~
I was about to point that out...hopefully he recovers. RvP has been far from his best, but I really blame the system (one that only allows us to create a handful of chances per game) rather than the players at this point. Same for falcao really.

3123~~~
I'm glad he's injured and can't play today. He's been ruining our fast flowing football all season.

3124~~~
Yea we really tore Yeovil Town and QPR apart with fast flowing football without Van Persie.

3125~~~
lol

3126~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3127~~~
At least Falcao could show us what he's capable of.

3128~~~
I hope this is a wum attempt.

3129~~~
That's been non-existent, but I do agree van Persie has been a few levels below what we expect of him.

3130~~~
He's being sarcastic- the post was from half time. Look at the last post he made in the thread:

3131~~~
Just a bit of sarcasm.

3132~~~
Have to admit, I have slightly mixed emotions about this quick recovery. Obviously great he's available for selection but I'll be pissed if that means Falcao doesn't start.

In fact, I'd much rather see Falcao and Wilson up top for this particular fixture. I suspect Van Gaal may not be of the same opinion.

3133~~~
i'm with you on that.

3134~~~
Yeah he shouldn't start this game.

Falcao and Wilson made some good plays together and created some chances when they were on the pitch together, I really want to see what they can do if they both start. Maybe Wilson's pace and Falcao's movement and awareness means this combo could potentially form the best partnership.

3135~~~
Van Persie is a superior stiker to Falcao and he has performed better than the colombian this season. Fans just prefer him because he's a new shinny toy. When it comes to effectiveness RvP is the best choice. Just give him good service.

3136~~~
Yeovil. Can't really remember Falcao and Wilson creating something between each other against QPR either to be fair, more like Wilson doing everything he could to set up Falcao.

With all that being said, I wouldn't play RVP either, I'd give him a rest, just had a little knock so it's better to rest him.

3137~~~
Forgot about that game haha, still though, I would prefer to see some consistency in our front line now.

3138~~~
Great to have him back, hope he starts tomorrow.

3139~~~
Not sure about any of that. Regarding this season Van Persie has played a lot more so he's bound to have a couple of good 90 minutes under his belt that Falcao hasn't but he's also put in many more really poor performances. I don't give a toss about shiny toys I'm just bored of watching mediocre to crap displays from Van Persie and don't think Falcao has been given enough chances to prove he can play any better.

3140~~~
Falcao started 5 games in a row and he impressed LVG so much that he was dropped out of the squad for the Soton game. How many games is enough for people to stop using the "he didn't have any chances" card?

He is a nice guy and hard worker and I'm sure everybody wants him to make it here, but the truth is that his finishing is shit and he can't control the ball half the time.

3141~~~
His finishing hasn't been all that while he's been here, but unless he's had a Torres-esque sudden decline, which is unlikely, it's a bit of an exaggeration to say that his finishing is outright shit when he's proven himself in the past to be a top class striker.

3142~~~
Van Persie is better than Falcao but neither are playing at the standard we require. I'd much rather play Rooney and Wilson, or failing that, Rooney alone.

3143~~~
He's had less chances than Van Persie. That's for damn sure. Unlike Van Persie, he's trying to get used to a new team, in a new league. So he should be cut more, rather than less, slack after a few poor games.

3144~~~
That's one way of looking at it. But you can also say that Falcao is only here for 1 season and we have to pay a lot of money to keep him beyond that, so his performances should be more scrutinized than the performances of our other players.

3145~~~
I'd say a player with pedigree for the club and in the league should be cut more slack as we know what they're capable of.

3146~~~
That's a fair point but age isn't on his side and it's a <i>really</i> long time since he last put a run of decent performances together. He's had such a long run of bad form I can't see the harm in giving him some time out and seeing if Falcao can play himself into some form, given more than 5 games to do so. 

Having said that, I wouldn't be entirely against dropping the pair of them.

3147~~~
Do you think Wilson has been playing up to the standard we expect, when he has been given chances? Because in the main, he's been pretty anonymous.

3148~~~
Just for the pace and balance in a strike force, really. Van Persie and Rooney never has and never will work as a pairing, and Falcao just seems like he'll never click.

3149~~~
Falcao's record shows that he's the superior goalscorer. Its still not really fair to compare them when RVP has been shoehorned into the team and Falcao has mostly played a bit part this season.

3150~~~
I don't think we can really judge either of them until we stop playing this awful brand of football. Van Persie is and always ha been a better player than Falcao though so it makes sense that he'll get more game time. Falcao doesnt look even close to fit enough yet which is both worrying and good reason for why Van Persie should play ahead of him.

3151~~~
I hope RVP is giving some time on the sidelines and we Falcao is given the chance to be the main striker.

3152~~~
Falcao's been mainly a bit shit (although slightly better in his last game?) but he does seem to have that knack of making things happen.

At the end of the day he's  three years younger than Van Persie, was a sensational striker not all that long ago and has already proven once he can come back from an ACL repair and perform at the highest level.

Be a terrible shame if he's in and out of the team to a point where he never gets going and we sack him off in the summer then watch him get back to his best at another club. All so we can keep playing a 31 year old Van Persie who's looked a shadow of the player he once was for at least 18 months now.

With nobody else staking a decent claim to start every game up front I can't see the harm in keeping on starting Falcao and seeing if he can play his way into some fitness and form. Seems an awful waste of an opportunity (and money!) to do otherwise.

3153~~~
Van Persie at his best vs Falcao at his best is not even a contest. Yes he is probably more clinical but Van Persie in full flow is poetry in motion. His performance against Southamton was hands down the best performance a forward has given all season. He litrally played them on his own. Physically he hasn't declined, he showed that with his lung busting displays against Liverpool, Stoke home, Southampton, Newcastle. He is working and running harder than he's ever done. I just think he is a victim of a flawed system. Put him in  Arsenal, Chelsea or City and he would still be one of the worlds best.

3154~~~
I love RVP, but lets be realistic here, Falcao is a world class forward and he's younger. He's not valued at 40M plus just because. Falcao has a better goalrate at his peak than Suarez and Torres had at Liverpool. If you're not an avid follower of  La Liga then you obviously didn't see what he brought to Athletico Madrid. The man scored 41 in 51 for Porto and 52 in 68 for Athletico. RVP has never been that prolific in his career. Its not even about just being clinical. The man is like a bulldog and has scored some real sublime goals.

3155~~~
Falcao 52 in 68 (0.76) 2011-2013 and van Persie 56 in 76 (0.74) in the same period if you're talking in their respective leagues. 

And 41 in 51 is a higher rate but that's in the Portugese League which is not as strong as Spain or England.

3156~~~
Say what? Pretty sure RVP scored around 50 goals in his last 60 Arsenal matches. 2nd most prolific goalscorer in the world over the calendar year 2011 (behind Ronaldo, above Messi) with a sickening 1.06 goals/game ratio while playing in arguably the strongest league in the world. He had runs like 20 goals in 25 caps for Holland, 18 goals in 19 starts for Arsenal once - and if it wasn;t for injuries... Way more assists than Falcao too.

3157~~~
Seriously, who cares that its in the Portuguese league? 41 in 51 is a great record regardless of what league it was achieved in. RVP has only ever had two 30 plus seasons, and in the remaining others the best he managed was 22 in a season. On average he's barely been a 20 goals a season striker.

3158~~~
You have to take RVP's injury record into account though.  30+ goal seasons would have been the norm, had he been fit more often for Arsenal. 

Not discounting Falcao or anything though, just making a point.

3159~~~
Its a good point, but its also a moot point. Aguero has an outstanding goalrate despite being an injury prone player

3160~~~
RVP had an even worse injury record from what I remember.

3161~~~
Yea yea. Fair enough. The record stands that Falcao is much more deadly.

3162~~~
Theyre actually pretty much dead level (at their best) on any offensive stat you choose to compare them on. Goals scored, shots taken, shots on target are all within minor percentage points of each other. The only one where there is a slight difference is that Falcao is marginally more deadly for the number of chances he gets, although its still a small difference.

The only consideration is that one is 3 years older and the other is recovering from a huge injury. My opinion is that RVP is getting too old to ever regain top form whereas Falcao at least has a chance of regaining his, and we should side with him because of that.

3163~~~
RVP at his best is the much better player. It's not even all that close.

Even right now RVP is well ahead.

3164~~~
Bingo. Amazing that people can't see that. It's not as though Van Persie has only recently stopped playing at his very best. How long is it now? 18 months?

3165~~~
Both SAF and Rio said in their books that the team had to repeatedly be told to pass the ball to RVP and pick out his runs. We even had a special meeting just to say "pass it to Van Persie"! Can't help but think there's a bit of that going on here. He's of no use if we aren't picking out his runs and, like any striker, his overall play suffers when he's not scoring goals.

3166~~~
We should play Rooney up top and play 1 of these 2 depending on whoever's in better form. End of season, take a call based on performance.

3167~~~
He's been consistently missing chances he'd score in his sleep when he was at his best. It can't be all down to poor service. He's a shadow of the player he once was. Surely you can see that?

3168~~~
He's missed chances for us even at his best. That's nothing new. Was the same for Arsenal as well.

His all round play is still alevel above Falcao so he should get the nod.

3169~~~
In a way, the more chances he misses means more chances created and therefore more chances of him scoring. He had a ridiculous number of misses and shots hitting the frame of the goal in his first season.

3170~~~
Nonsense. He's much more likely to miss chances in the last year or so than he would have at his best.

Missing chances is only half the problem anyway. His all round play has deteriorated massively.

3171~~~
Not really nonsense if you paid attention. He missed plenty of sitters and 1v1's in his first season.

3172~~~
I'll pay attention if you read my posts. "More likely to miss" does not mean he didn't miss plenty before.

3173~~~
Rvp might not have played as well as he used to but he's put in several performances that are a class above what any of our other strikers have shown. Sticking wayne up front doesn't really guarantee anything. His performances, all be it in midfield should tell us that.

3174~~~
I would say it's been more like 12 months actually, he was still as good as his first season up until he got that 6 week injury around December in my opinion and it was more that the team had regressed and was playing terrible football under Moyes. He hasn't been as good since he came back from that injury but he's still had some games like Olympiakos, Chelsea this season and then a small run of games in December where he played well.

Will he ever get back to his best? Doubtful, but let's what happens in the next 6 months or so because I think he was in a race against time to be fit for the World Cup and didn't look fully fit earlier in the season. 8 in 20 isn't exactly terrible either, even if he again never becomes the player he once was he could still be a useful player for 15-20 goals a season for a few years yet.

People might think this is me just desperately defending him but I would love nothing more than both Falcao and van Persie to get back to their very best. It's a difficult one because Falcao is younger and at his peak is a phenomenal player but would cost us at least 35-40 million it looks like and I don't think he's shown enough to warrant that purchase yet. van Persie is older and in a possibly permanent decline but is already our player and has a strong relationship with van Gaal and his philosophy.

3175~~~
Yeah, 18 months is probably harsh. I'll go with 12. It's still long fecking time though!

3176~~~
Seriously, the logic in this thread <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3177~~~
If the rest of the team we're playing amazing football, and he was rubbish I would agree, but fact is, the attacking unit is playing like garbage, how on earth do people expect him to be able to show his best form?

3178~~~
Doesn't matter, he has been past it for 18 months, he was never as prolific as Falcao (while both played as #9's their whole career) and his goalscoring record for club and country was piss poor in 2013-2014, which was last season. Also he has been fit the whole season and he missed so many chances, he never used to miss easy chances while scoring difficult goals, that was never his trademark. Also, the team does create enough, games like Southampton away for example. He scored 2 yeah, but he needed 14 chances for that, and it wasn't like he was the best player on the pitch aside from the goals.

3179~~~
Yeah true, but from what I've heard Falcao wasn't all that at Monaco either. Fingers crossed van Persie is over his injuries because he hasn't had any major ones this season. Last season Moyes was to blame for one by rushing him back and the other was a bad tackle from an Olympiakos player which can happen to anyone.

Funnily enough, they've actually showed some decent link up play at times when paired together such as Leicester, West Ham and Newcastle but Falcao's been injured and was only making 10-20 minute cameos at one point too so we've seen less of that.

3180~~~
Are you serious... we created sweet fa in that game Southampton game, a game we should have lost. Also his goalscoring record last season wasn't piss poor, he scored 18 goals in 28 games for United,  for reference Rooney got 19 in 40 games (in a season where Rooney apparently was United best player and was back to his best).

EDIT: I'm not even saying he will get back to his best, but some of what I am reading in here is overboard, the team isn't playing well, we're not creating enough and so stands to reason none of our strikers are at the top of the scoring charts.

3181~~~
No, he's not. Read his other posts in the thread.

3182~~~
Is there a single player in our squad playing as well as they used to? You'd also think being 31 was the end of the world. In the not so distant past we signed a striker at 31 and he was player of the year 3 years later.

3183~~~
too many players in the team who needs service from other players. RVP is one of them, lost all his pace, can't create chances on his own, can't beat a man and his conversion rate is pretty awful. Can he hold up play? Yes, he can but League 1 striker should do that. This and clearing the ball from the front post defending corners, the only assets he brings to our play which is far from enough. He would definitely benefit from being the top man, playing lone striker in 4-2-3-1, it would provide more service for him but still I believe he is well past it and should only start on the bench.

Players like Costa/Aguero are on a different level. Hopefully Wilson can bulk up and get better in his overall play as we would have brilliant player and the one we need up front.. People saying we have got top strikers are clueless. They all are living from their reputation. Anyway I would definitely swap Falcao for Persie if it was possible as he at least looks like he tries and fights for the ball unike RVP, who has got stamina of u21 players and no fight spirit unless it comes to some rash challenges late in the game as he gets frustrated easily. After his first season it is very disappointing to see him struggling more and more and the saddest thing is that he is friend of the manager:-/

3184~~~
Van Persie played his whole career at Feyenoord as a winger. He was a no.10 for Arsenal up until 09/10. He was also a winger for Holland until 2010. Factor in his injury issues and its no surprise that falcao has averaged more goals per season. However Van Persie at his best 2010- 2013 was not only just as prolific as the goal poacher specialist Falcao he was also 5 times the player.

No one who truly loves the game of Football can tell me that Falcao was better. RvP paints master pieces on the football pitch at his best. Falcao just scores goals.

3185~~~
This is rubbish. You talk as if you're speaking in facts. This isn't science. You just prefer and appreciate RVP  more as a player, thats fine because I really like RVP too. Falcao still has the better record, we can't speak in ifs and maybes. Its what it is.

3186~~~
Well he's back looking like Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell, it's like he's taking Giggs place as our grey templed oldster. He'll no doubt start on Saturday and I doubt it matters, our strikers all look much of a muchness right now so we might as well stick him in.

3187~~~
There was a moment when him and Falcao literally ran into each other whilst making the same run. It was so frustrating to watch considering the caliber of each player.

On a wider but similar issue, I am a massive fan of our big three (Rooney, Van Persie and Falcao) individually. However, as a collective I am starting to believe it will never work. I still can't understand why Rooney doesn't play up top. I have him down as our best finisher.

3188~~~
One great season,now he is shadow of it. I take it for granted that he made that good run as an experienced player but he should have scored. His overall play is quite useless.. Wouldn't mind if Wilson started every game instead of Persie. Young boy didn't have a great game but lacked service today, small pitch for him andobviously needs to do better but deserved chance tonight and will only get better with games under his belt. On Van Persie you can only see growing frustration and more and more grey hairs. I wouldn't mind if we sold him this summer. I think we need to reinforce in attack as much as in defense

3189~~~
Had 3 touches of the ball in that sub appearance, one of them missing a sitter. Herrera, who got subbed on at the same time as him, albeit in midfield, had 38. It's ridiculous how he just lets games flow by without doing anything.

3190~~~
Its very frustrating, as it'll probably be him and Falcao upfront against Leicester, which doesn't work as they're basically the same striker.

3191~~~
Shaqueel van Persie is on Citys books right?

3192~~~

3193~~~
not really that excited to have him come back, to be honest. i really wish we'd play with just one striker, although whether that's him, falcao or rooney, i don't really care.

just not all three of them at the same time.

3194~~~
He's tailor made for Serie A at this point IMO.

3195~~~
Sadly its time to say goodbye to RVP, (and thanks, but no thanks to Falcao) not sure who could come in as a true 'lead the line striker' but thats what we need at the moment, would Zlatan be worth a punt for a season while we develope a young striker ?

3196~~~
have to wonder how much zlatan has left in his tank... he's not young anymore.

3197~~~
Still believe in him and that he has something more to offer... we have to start playing good football as a team first though (and yes, I get that he also has to play well for that to happen...)

3198~~~
A young striker who's currently scoring for fun is lacazette for Lyon.

3199~~~
The name which every club who needs a striker wants. Seeing as many top clubs don't really need a striker at the moment it's a good chance to get him, as he's different to RVP/Falcao/Rooney. We should move out RVP/Falcao and bring someone like him in. Van Persie's past his peak and I can't see him continuing here much longer.

3200~~~
You sure about that? think he will take Falcao´s place? or they will both show up making the same run?

3201~~~
I was a big fan of Van Persie during his first year at United, and if you want to feel the same, just watch again the season review, and you’ll see that he carried the team by himself.

Of course he had others very good players with him, but he had this special thing, the thing that made everything possible during a game. During big games, he always scored important goals, Arsenal home and away, Chelsea two goals away, Liverpool home and away and City away…

He was also terrific when the team was poor… He was our star man, and remember, Fergie saying that he was the catalyzer like Cantona…  He was truly unstoppable

But he’s not anymore the player he was. He played 20 games, full games, and was only average, so I really hope that we can find a new number one upfront. I always told that he was making good runs, good work upfront, but he’s not decisive. We’re missing match winners, and he was one. Since he can’t be what he should be, I would like him to be whether our number 2 striker or even been part of an exchange for a top midfielder like Vidal or Pogba as Juve wanted him 2 years ago also

3202~~~
Was excellent today. The criticism of him has been well over the top this season and I reckon he'll prove most on here wrong.

3203~~~
Nice finish for the goal.

3204~~~
Good goal, set up Falcao in the first half, started a counter-attack that led to 2nd goal, been our best attacking player today I feel.

3205~~~
Great goal and its importance could not be understated. Made it look so easy too. Very difficult finish on the half volley while off balance. Top class from him today.

3206~~~
Very good half after his injury lay-off.

3207~~~
Good game today, nothing more to add.

3208~~~
serve him with a chance or two he will deliver obviously. not quite robin of 2011 to 2013 but still effective.

3209~~~
Good first half, lovely bit of skill to start the move for the Falcao goal. Also a quality, if completely unorthodox, finish for his goal.

3210~~~
He played well, here's hoping that his confidence is fully back.

3211~~~
Nice cross for the goal.

3212~~~
Went down the tunnel instead of onto the bench when he was subbed off. Wonder what that's all about <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

3213~~~
feeling a bit sweaty to sit on cold bench, propably

3214~~~
Bit of a meh performance again, really. His movement is still there, but the finishing was a bit erratic.

3215~~~
Did OK and a good assist, good movement too but finishing well below par.

3216~~~
Looked like he was wincing a bit as he was walking off and may be carrying a knock ?

3217~~~
Yeah it's possible. He didn't seem too bad though, so probably nothing serious.

3218~~~
Thought it was his best performance this season minus the finishing. Made a lot of good runs. It is Cambridge though.

3219~~~
Southampton definitely was his best. That was RvP of old.

3220~~~
Time to replace him.

3221~~~
Why? Too soon for that, he still has a lot to offer us.

3222~~~
Don't think we should extend his contract either. If we do he should take a pay cut and happy to be a back up striker, we should be looking to phase him out.

3223~~~
He really could be in double figures from those little clipped balls over the top from Di Maria already.

3224~~~
Mostly good today, albeit not spectacularly so. Weird how his finishing looks to have deteriorated so as his movements look just as sharp as ever.

3225~~~
If I hadn't seen the game, I'd think he missed some sitters today judging on the comments <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Didn't see his erratic finishes, only one header where he should've done better. Insane control and finish for the Di Maria chip, keeper made a good safe. Keeper also made good saves on some of Di Maria and Rooney's attempts, and then he missed a rather easy ball from outside the box by Wilson. Great for him that he scored though.

RVP had some ridiculous flicks and touches, idiots saying he's past it obviously missed those because their minds can't registerthem or something.

3226~~~
He was trying so hard. Made great runs, got the touch right, but just couldn't finish.

3227~~~
An alright performance from him, should've scored at least a goal today. Overall all I'm not too worried about him. If we can keep creating chances like we have these last couple of games, he'll probably get about 20 goals for us this season. His movement is still top class and you could see the desire to score goals from him.

3228~~~
Its already February, he may very well have something to offer, but the fact remains that we can't afford to enter into a new season with RVP as our main striker

3229~~~
His movement was superb today, just one of those days for him, the goals will come.

3230~~~
He wanted a goal today, but the chances he got werent the easiest. I think the team is working hard to spot RvP's runs, he can be deadly when you play him right.

3231~~~
He wasn't too bad, but I'd have Falcao and Rooney as strikers for our next game against West Ham.

3232~~~
I hope he's not first choice striker next season.

3233~~~
20 goals this season ? you expect him to score 11 goals in our remaining 19 games ? .... i hope so

3234~~~
Nice assist but more concerned with getting himself a goal than the team at times.

Agreed, he should move into the Sheringham role with Rooney and a new partner up top.

3235~~~
Could've used some luck today, as well.

3236~~~
"He was snatching at his chances, but he's getting into the right positions and that's reassuring"

3237~~~
They have had quite a good understanding with those passes, happens like every other game. I don't think Van persie has managed to score once from them though, a couple of seasons ago with the chances he's had, he would be around 20 goals for the season probably. Missed so many sitters already.

3238~~~
The rebound from rooney's volley was a sitter, and he surely should have scored from one of the 3-4 chip passes he got in the box. Did alright, but he should have scored a couple.

3239~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Feb/Louis-van-Gaal-confirms-Robin-van-Persie-substitution-against-Cambridge-was-tactical.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Louis van Gaal has revealed his decision to substitute Robin van Persie against Cambridge United on Tuesday night was pre-planned and not due to any injury.</a>

3240~~~
Apparently 11 attempted passes all game, if he's not scoring he has to be dropped.

3241~~~
Thought he was ok, looked about as happy as Aaron Lennon throughout the match though.

3242~~~
van Persie had many chances to score today, but it was a shame that he couldn't get one. A couple of wild shots off target didn't help either with this.

His movement, positioning, close control, and dribbling seems to be coming back. The Leceister match showed some signs that he's coming back to his best, and this match confirmed it, even if he couldn't get a goal. He just needs to get back the confidence and belief in front of goal, and he may become a threatening striker again.

3243~~~
His patchy form this season seems to coincide with the disjointed, slow play we were doing. This seems to be getting faster so let's see if his form improves with better service. He got plenty of the ball last night.

3244~~~
His assist was world-class IMO.

3245~~~
To be fair, he hardly saw a good ball in the first half or so.

3246~~~
Thought he looked back to the old RVP last night. Was unlucky not to score.

Lovely little chip to Rojo too, made it look dead easy.

3247~~~
Think he's played alright the last couple of games. Took his goal well against Leicester and was good in the build up to the second. Last night he maybe should have got a goal but the keeper did well and his assist for Rojo was very nice.

His record is good against West Ham too- every time he's played them since he joined us he's scored.

3248~~~
Been hearing this all season, is he back or not?

3249~~~
I don't think he will ever be consistently back to that form no. But it's nice to see he still has it when he wants too. 

I do think though that 1 of RVP/Falcao should be leaving, and we should be after the next young hot striker (Lacazette/whoever).

3250~~~
His all round play has been good for quite some time time now, the thing that is not working for him is his finishing. He has put in quite a few performances like last night where if he takes one of the chances and scores a goal, he is MOTM contender, but because he has missed his performance is considered poor. 

There was a game some time ago(I think it was vs Hull) where he put in a decent performance but didn't score and the usual suspects bumped the thread to tell us how shit he was, most people agreed, then in the next 5 minutes he scores a goal and gets subbed and suddenly everybody agrees he had a great game. 


It is funny is that after every game where he doesn't score, the same guys can't bump this thread fast enough to tell us how he is too old, slows our attack or how the mythical RVP from 2012 would have scored that with his left bollock and it's not only this thread, same shit I see in Rooney's(should have been sold and never made captain) and Mata's threads(panic buy, only passes sideway and back).

It seems that if some Caftard's favorite player is not playing for some reason, the first impulse is to shit on the player that plays instead of him. Falcao not playing? fecking RVP the old shit only plays because he is buddies with LVG. Herrera not playing? fecking Rooney and his Scholes wannabe cross field passes only plays because he is captain. Some seem to be supporting the players more than they support the club.


Anyway, as shit as RVP has been this season(as some like to remind us after every game), he is still our best performing striker. Even with his shit finishing, he is still our leading scorer and like it or not, he is still our best option for the striker position.

3251~~~
IMO he will never be "back" to what he was. We'll get the occasional good game where he looks like he is but in reality his level has dropped. He'll have some poor games too. I think he should have his role gradually diminished. We can't go into a season with RvP as our main striker again.

3252~~~
Yep, he hasn't scored one of them, its incredibly annoying. Di Maria must be more annoyed then anybody though, he could probably have doubled his assist total with chances RVP has missed alone <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3253~~~
I think he is harshly judged my some on here, the service he gets sometimes is next to none and he has to drop back just to retrieve the ball,

When on form even at his age he is lethal at finishing and i hope he is still here in 3 years time, Can you imagine how much it helps for example Wilson training with this guy, Im still a massive fan of RVP and for one hopes he stays with us, I would prefer us to keep him, not buy Falcao and sign a few more young energetic strikers to compete with him and wilson.

3254~~~
So how much longer are people going to stick up for this waste of space? 

Offering absolutely nothing yet again

3255~~~
I agree. He's wasting all these chances and passes into feet he is getting.

3256~~~
He's been better then the rest of our "forward" players - by virtue that he hasn't actually wasted the ball every time he's got it.

Falcao has been worse.

3257~~~
He's at least been <i>somewhat</i> involved, more so than Falcao anyway...

3258~~~
Still better than Falcao though.

3259~~~
Yet to will get some people in here saying well he's not getting service blah blah, 

he should've been benched weeks ago then maybe we could play our best striker (Rooney) actually in his position where he's very effective

3260~~~
Have you ever heard of sarcasm?

3261~~~
It's not really his game, but like Neville was saying, Sakho and Valencia are running the channels. They've hardly had great service, but their movement has meant our CBs have been busy. Him an Falcao aren't doing this. Not their game I know, but it's hurting us.

3262~~~
Yes I have but I suppose you are one of the people I mentioned that blames everything apart from rvp

3263~~~
Woeful. Just woeful

3264~~~
We should have let him go.  SAF squeezed one last quality season out of him, and he's been on the decline ever since.  Moyes and LvG had the perfect excuse to move him, because he wasn't their signing.  Taking Falcao on loan when he was available was a sensible move, keeping RVP and letting Welbeck go was not.

3265~~~
I'm not sure how anyone could watch that half and think that RVP was worse than Falcao.

3266~~~
What are we blaming him for? He's a striker. You need to get him the ball in the penalty box. What do you want him to do? Are you posting in the Falcao thread about why he's doing because he's done less than Van Persie. Today and all season.

3267~~~
18 months past it. Wish Moyes had chance to ship him out before getting sacked.

3268~~~
Thy don't need to do it if you actually have wide players playing wide. I've no idea where Rooney has been half the game but it hasn't been on the flank.

3269~~~
They were both shite. Difficult to say who was worse.

3270~~~
If Rooney and Januzaj, that leaves Blind in the middle on his own. They both need to do more but it's clearly not part of our tactics for anyone other than the full backs to play wide.

3271~~~
That is a view point I can understand (though I think RVP has at least tried to be smart with his use of the ball - Falcao has just passed it backwards or lost it) - but to single RVP is a bit weird.

3272~~~
Very true.

3273~~~
Very poor today, falcao is even worse and it's worrying LVG wants to keep playing them together despite the lack of any partnership and fact they are both past it. What's even more worrying is we might have both of them here next season, I don't even care which one comes off at half time or who for just don't want to see them both in the second half or in the starting eleven together in any away game.

3274~~~
Thought he was decent so far, no way he was one of our worst players like some here seem to imply.

3275~~~
No because I'm fairly confident we won't be signing Falcao he won't be our player so I'm not bothered what he does, I wanted him to be a success obviously but him and rvp is obviously past it now and shouldn't be playing for us if mourinho was out manager rvp would've been shipped out last season yet because he is LVG favourite he never gets dropped and the team is suffering just to accommodate him and Falcao

3276~~~
I honestly don't think he's been that bad at times. He sometimes takes too long on the ball and his lack of pace is evident, but he's had a couple of decent efforts and has occasionally shown some intelligent play on the ball. Not brilliant, either, but I don't think he's been too awful.

3277~~~
Baffles me that he can still get to play for 80 minutes in a team looking to finish in the top 4

3278~~~
I think he's done quite well with what delivery he's gotten. Much better than his striking partner.

3279~~~
He's been our best player. I have no problems with him or his role in the team.

3280~~~
Blind great technique!!!!!!

3281~~~
He is done. Gotta go!

3282~~~
Should have scored with that one that he drilled at the keeper but the volley was as good as he could do plus he created two good chances. Not great but definitely better than Falcao.

3283~~~
Seriously needs dropping. He's just mindlessly hitting it and hoping.

3284~~~
Should have scored at least one. Inexcusably poor finishing but if people want a striker dropped it should be Falcao. Persie's hold up play was and is far better.

3285~~~
I've had enough of his shit attitude. When the going gets tough he shrivels. No fight, no determination to push the team on. And these days he can't even control the ball under pressure let alone pull something out of the bag.

3286~~~
Falcao will obviously get most of the stick but RVP was poor as well. He can strike the ball well when it drops to him but the rest of his game needs improvement, he's getting lazy.

3287~~~
He set up Falcao with a great ball as well.

3288~~~
There was a moment in the second half where he had a pull back (possibly from Shaw), he could have hit it first time into the far corner, instead he took a touch and the chance was gone. That split second hesitance has become a real feature of his game this season. He's not playing on instinct.

3289~~~
I actually think that Wilson and RvP could be a good partnership if van Gaal is willing to try it for a few games in a row. van Persie's hold up play is still good even if he's maybe not as clinical as he used to be and with Wilson's pace and movement dragging defenders out of position it could open up more space for him in the box.

3290~~~
He needs to be dropped. He looks very laboured out there.

3291~~~
As I said in the Falcao thread, when the teams having such a poor game as we did today and you get one chance to score, you expect a guy of Van Persie's finishing prowess to score.

3292~~~
Just play him up top with Rooney in behind and he will be fine.

3293~~~
Still our best striker. Got to remember he created a clear cut chance for Falcao with his brilliance. Wasn't the best overall game from him, and might have done better with that 2nd chance he had, but he holds it up, brings others into play much better than Falcao. His performance at Southampton is arguably one of the best individual game from any of our players this season so those saying he's finished are wide of the mark. Him and Falcao as a pair just don't work so hopefully that's the last of it.

3294~~~
Great take on the chest from Rojos through ball, decent hit on target.
Great through ball for Falcao from which he completely fecked up.
Decent effort from Falcaos pass again on target, did he miss a sitter today?
Most of the time he gets them on target.
Yes he hasn't played as well as he has done but who the feck has?

3295~~~
Man its good to see some common sense at last.

3296~~~
He was poor. I don't think we should be getting rid of him though. He is clearly not what he used to be but it would be good if he accepted a smaller role in the squad. He shouldn't be our number one striker anymore. LvG has some big decisions to make. I kept hearing that he is a manager that isn't afraid of the big calls or the big egos, but it hasn't looked like that so far. RvP is an issue that needs fixing.

3297~~~
RvP has scored one more goal than Rooney in the league, despite having played more minutes, and having played exclusively as a striker (while Rooney has played 75% of his games as a midfielder).

But you want to talk about his 'brilliance', and 'the best individual game from any of our players this season'.

I wouldn't mind so much, if you weren't so persistently critical of players who are playing at least as well as/as poorly as RvP, even while out of position.

3298~~~
The system hurts and limits him at the moment. His finishing has been off and he started the season very slowly, as did the whole team. Playing up top with current Falcao would hurt anyone at the moment though, and playing without a proper midfield hurts, as does the woeful service they get. It's obvious none of our attacking players are delivering as they should at the moment but I have to laugh when I see posts about RVP being finished.

3299~~~
Coming from the guy who thinks we should <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/posts/17080644/">sell Rooney</a> and his style of play is '<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/posts/17080702/">predictable and shite</a>'.

Don't really want to turn this into a Rooney Vs RvP thing, but it's blatantly obvious you give RvP a much easier time of it - and if the system is limiting anyone, it's Rooney, given it's putting him in a position he has never played with any regularity.

3300~~~
His finishing this season has been, on the whole, woeful. He might be our top scorer, but for all the grief about 'lack of service' he could have quite easily doubled his tally from Di Maria assists alone.

3301~~~
The service is shite though, and that's down to the system. Strikers don't put away all the chances that are created for them. Maybe we should sign Giroud hmm

We'd play much better with Herrera, Mata and Di Maria behind a striker. The 3 of them linked up brilliantly earlier in the season.

3302~~~
RvP basically has the same status as Rooney i.e "privilege" aka undroppable, hes started every PL game he was available for but with 9 goals in 22 games this is not the same RvP of old. I hate this privilege shit of van Gaal's if a player is not performing and you have others that can fill in then fecking sub him off! Still I do agree that he has not been getting great service (was it THAT much better in 12/13?) in the box he needs more chances to score which is why I hold Ruud at a higher esteem that guy was a machine.

3303~~~
His form fluctuates in correlation with Carrick's absence. Correlation does not always imply causation though.

3304~~~
Carrick has a knack of finding his runs that nobody else does so that's not a surprise.

3305~~~
Non existent in the first half today.

3306~~~
Him and Falcao are just looking like they will never form a proper partnership. Too similar types of players and not getting enough service either.

One of them needs to be dropped to make way for more width and/or an extra body in midfield.

3307~~~
10 goals ...terrible season

3308~~~
Excellent pen.

3309~~~
Great pen, which will no doubt overshadow a generally shite performance, and he'll start all our remaining games.

3310~~~
Wow, well that's that then.

3311~~~
Though he improved ever so slightly as the game went on. Shite is a little harsh. Close enough though.

3312~~~
Looked absolutely pissed.

3313~~~
Even if we upgrade it to 'close to shite', he shouldn't be starting games in my humble opinion.

3314~~~
Excellent Pen. Terrible game.

3315~~~
Always guaranteed to hold the ball up and bring others into play. Falcao was disastrous. RVP should start upfront alone in the next game.

3316~~~
Nor mine.

3317~~~
Has looked a lot better playing deeper, got a lot more involved and had more space to do things. Showed som good passing and dribbling at least

3318~~~
You could have been forgiven for thinking he wasn't playing until he took the penalty. Took it well though.

3319~~~
My main problem with him is he doesn't get involved when the balls not into his feet. He doesn't move, and he doesn't hassle.

But, when he does get the ball he's still magic. His hold up play is excellent, he can beat a player with the ball and his passing is very good. I think its a case of shafting Falcao and playing Wilson to do both he and Van Persies running.

3320~~~
I think we could merge RVP and Falcao's thread. Both have been woeful all season. 

He clearly still has a decent finish in him but so do most of the ex pro's.

3321~~~
Involved in all goals, almost never lost the ball under pressure. Had a decent game, one of our better performers tonight, but obviously people calling him shit as after usual. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3322~~~
The Falcao playing better than him is the funniest thing on here just now.

3323~~~
Its really strange how he refuses to get involved in the game. When he came deeper in the second half he looked much better. He always seems to be running away from the ball this season. I don't know if its a confidence issue(i doubt it since he's always been a very confident player) or if Van Gaal is instructing him to move in behind at every opportunity. When he has the ball at his feet he uses it very effectively so i can't understand why he isn't coming deeper and to get himself in the game.

3324~~~
Falcao is like a new toy to most Utd fans. They just project what they want to see in their interpretation of his performances.

3325~~~
Yeah, that RVP vs Falcao thread is ridiculous. Shocking how many people think Falcao has been better, makes you wonder what the feck are some watching, because it isn't even close.

3326~~~
RvP got the exact same treatment last season though.  (i.e. constantly being given the benefit of the doubt despite turning in a number of indifferent performances).

3327~~~
Much better RVP today......

3328~~~
Seemed to realise at half time that nothing was going to happen if he didn't sort it out himself, and got way more involved around halfway than normal. His touch is occasionally still the best in the business, has velcro in those boots. 

But, I don't think we'd look any better with him up top by himself. So I don't see how he can fit in a 'best XI' given two strikers is utterly failing us.

3329~~~
Thought it was a bit odd to sub him on just to take a penalty but it worked I suppose. Would have been nice to see Smalling become the first centre back in premier league history to score a hattrick though.

3330~~~
Did he? Because I'm pretty sure everybody wanted him out, because he doesn't give a feck, he's always injured, etc. Maybe you should recheck the RVP thread from last season, you'd be surprised.

3331~~~
This. It did feel that he got better as the game went on. However, he was playing really deep it seemed.

3332~~~
Not really. When he scored the hattrick against Olympiacos and got injured many Utd fans were calling his injury a "blessing in disguise" and were rather pleased.

3333~~~
Barely any celebration when he scored and it was similar the other week as well, just looks generally unhappy, probably his pride in his performance hurting I imagine.

Very true, they are both dreadful but in their shit & shittier double act Falcao is definitely shittier.

3334~~~
When Rojo smacked the ball at him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3335~~~
The second half was one of his better outings for us this season.

Long may it continue. Looks way more decisive and technically proficient.

3336~~~
And there's plenty of criticism of Falcao knocking around now as well. But as I remember it, whenever we played badly last season, threads devoted to the usual Cafe whipping boys - Young, Cleverley, Rooney to an extent - would grow by about ten pages, most of it abuse. While RvP, despite often being as bad as any of them, would escape the brunt of it.

3337~~~
With all due respect RvP was never as bad as young and cleverly last season. Now youre just making it up. He scored 18 goals last season despite practically being out for half of it.

3338~~~
RvP has always been the Golden Boy. Even with LvG it would seem. Hopefully he and Falcao are both shipped out in the summer

3339~~~
I'd much rather he play the target man than Falcao because his hold up play is vastly superior, but both are being shafted by the instistence on playing them in the same position.

For all his latter age faults, he's still an incredibly classy and useful player.

3340~~~
He could have killed him!

3341~~~
I can remember a number of games where he was poor to anonymous, and he never seemed to get it half as harshly as some of our other players. It's only over the last two months or so that the criticism has started to become persistent, despite him being way short of his consistent best for nearly two years now.

3342~~~
RvP wasn't that bad today. 

He can still actually manipulate the ball, which gives him the edge over Falcao straight away, while he was dropping deep to get involved and was trying to press the opposition.

Give him the lone striker role and get Di Maria and Januzaj closely flanking him.

3343~~~
his decent second half doesn't change the fact he is piss poor in almost every game this season and the last one.. he doesn't look like he cares is extremely off the pace. He's got worse statistics than Pele who is only slightly above average striker. He is far from United quality bad sadly he will continue to paly as he licks the van Gaals balls. 

No sane manager would give him that much time to prove himself. The fact he is playing in this stupid system with two striekers doesn't help him but than again why do we play that? Ship him out asap and get in some faster better stronger who can do more than basics - hold up play and goal here and there..

Someone like Welbeck with goals. How good is actually Lacazette?

3344~~~
Boss penalty. 

He needs to get involved more though, he was invisible in the first half.

3345~~~
he was okay... seemed to be dropping a lot deeper in the 2nd half.

i want to see wilson start, whether it's alone or with rvp doesn't matter. but we're playing with 10 men having rvp and falcao as strikers.

3346~~~
Thought he played well today, the thing is he's absolutely piss poor when linking up with Falcao. They're on opposite wavelengths to each other a lot of the time.

3347~~~
Invisible first half, much much better in the second. 

He plays like he wants to be carried by the team, no drive whatsoever, which is strange from van Persie. He seems very joyless, I thought he'd miss the pen as well.

3348~~~
He's still the monster player he has always been but it's obviously not working with having to play with a strike partner in Falcao who is so off form and offering so little. Van Persie should start every game on his own up top. In the few instances that he gets the ball he still looks as sharp and classy as ever

3349~~~
He didn't play well. Did about the bare minimum.

Saying that, if we're going to persist with two up top it should be a straight-shoot between him and Falcao, and RvP wins out right now easily.

3350~~~
I hate the fact that our center forward is totally neutered on counters. I want Rooney to play as a forward for that simple reason alone.

3351~~~
This. Playing him with Falcao is a recipe for disaster but IMO this movement in the box and ability are still top class.

3352~~~
He could've looked a bit happier when he scored the penalty.

3353~~~
He takes this extra touch quite often when he is bringing the ball down, receives it on the chest, then he taps it unnecessarily one time, then he brings it down. A little thing that has bugged me over the last games. It really slows down any opportunity to break quickly.

3354~~~
He really is a great player once he decides to show up in the game. IMO we’re overplaying him. Imagine if he played with that energy for the 30mins or so. I can see him doing that. I don’t see him doing that for the whole game twice a week for sure.

3355~~~
I actually liked that he looked pissed off.

3356~~~
hasn't shown me much of anything all season to keep him around.  Just one year older and one year lazier.  His only saving grace is that somehow Falcao is actually worse so he goes first, and we have plenty of other positions to fill.

3357~~~
I don't understand what games some of you watch. He's been miles better than Falcao this season, it's not even close. I thought he did well in the 2nd half yesterday and that's something I'd like to see him do a lot more of i.e come deeper rather than stand up top doing nothing.

One thing I did notice however, was that the crowd was starting to get on his back when he took ages to release the ball after holding it up. That's something he needs to improve upon.

3358~~~
He looked like a man who's been reading the Caf. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

3359~~~
Yup, there was some moaning/booing after unnecessary back passes as well, noticed that.

And yea, agree about being better than Falcao. Add to the fact that the latter is just a loanee (hopefully) and Robin actually has done for our club already so it's a nobrainer for me to leave him and get rid of, friendly but useless, Colombian.

3360~~~
I see your point he hasn't had a good season. But who has? In the current system and style I think very few strikers would struggle to play well. 

The lack of chances we create is worrying. No wonder RVP and Falcao are struggling to find goals. At the start of the game we had Blind as our only midfielder, with Rooney, Januzaj and Di Maria moving into attack. Blind would then drop into a back 3 which left us with very few passing options. We looked a lot better when Herrera came on. 

Once we sort the midfield out, we will start to create more chances and the strikers will bang them in. 

I would go with a team like this for our next game:
----------------- De Gea ------------

Valencia-- Smalling-- Rojo-- Shaw 

----------Blind------Herrera--------

Januzaj------Rooney------Di Maria

---------------Van Persie--------

3361~~~
I thought he was quite alright in the second half with the link-up and hold-up play. He did well as the second striker when Wilson came on.

3362~~~
I have no problem with line-up like this although Rafael on the right is debatable.. The problem with attack and lack of creating chances is that we need to feck the two strikers system off. It's bullshit and never worked with these particular strikers. Homer Simpson knows that one striker would do better in midfield to create chances or play two or at least one pacy striker up front and world class midfield (not actually strikers there)which we don't use. So on one hand yeah it's not only their fault but still I expect a lot better from such players. We are not creating a lot but we still have some chances and they need to finish it off. And they should also contribute more than hold the ball up which is really basics for strikers. They should also create chances on their own like Welbeck used to do with his movement and contribute to the team, which they don't do because they are simply old, slow and not capable of that. Van Persie had also poor season last season which we played on one striker. 

And one more point - this is one of our biggest problems we have got too many players who need players around them to look better but are unable to provide quality or rise the team level.. So for me it's not the lack of chances, rather lack of quality there, we would play much better with someone like Aguero

3363~~~
He is rightly getting called out by more than one pundit for not putting a shift in and for me the suspicion remains that either his game is deteriorating or he just isn't bothered enough. I'm leaning towards a combination of the two ie I don't think he is the player he was a couple of years ago plus he gives the impression that he's still in semi-sulk mode. I don't know what the stats say but it seems to me the few chances we are getting are largely being squandered by an RVP who up to a couple of season ago would have been putting them away.

3364~~~
We created no chances last night for him. We also created nothing for Falcao. Only shot on goal between them was RVP's penalty.

3365~~~
Yep agreed but it's not just about last night and how about we get in striker or two who can create something themselves.

3366~~~
Don't care what anyone says, Van Persie is still elite.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hh_zf8LJOuw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3367~~~
What was up with that Balotelli celebration.

3368~~~
Awful. Don't know why we start him, when he's just been out for a few weeks.

3369~~~
How many attacks has he ruined today? I'm fed up with him.

3370~~~
I can't believe fans still think he is elite, he is terrible by his standards - i have said this before but i will say it again - if we wanted a CF who works hard but doesn't score we should have kept Welbeck.

3371~~~
Getting rid of him and not signing Falcao this summer will do wonders.

3372~~~
It's down to playing two strikers.  We have no width, Rooney can't drop off deeper than RVP because Fellaini is in that space.  We'd be so much better off with Adnan on the wing in a 4231 than having two strikers up there.  RVP's play hasn't been great but it's so congested up top and we are way too narrow.

3373~~~
One pass to McNair just completely killed a good attack.

3374~~~
He's a problem.

3375~~~
Our best attacking player in the first half.

3376~~~
Time to go RVP....you're finished at this level more of s problem than an asset.

3377~~~
Has hold up the ball pretty well, some bad passes by him but not as bad as some imply.

3378~~~
He is still our best forward at keeping the ball with his back but still it means absolutely nothing when he always keeps it for far too long and usually passes it all the way to the defence almost every time. His decision making is absolutely terrible. 

Also, he is absolutely zero goal threat. I really don't see any point of him starting for us anymire, and I was big fan of him.

3379~~~
Couldn't even hit a barn door, we should play with one striker (Rooney).

3380~~~
I wonder how many shots he's had and how many on target!

3381~~~
No conviction in anything he's done today.

3382~~~
Fecking ridiculous that he is still on the pitch. Yet again an awful performance from him.

3383~~~
He's worse than Falcao.

3384~~~
has done very little to be fair. Rather have Mata on to play behind Rooney.

3385~~~
It's obvious he is not being played on merit but only because he is mates with the manager.

3386~~~
Worst player and no way should he still be on

3387~~~
Really pissed off. Good performance ruined by our grandads up top.. arghhhhhhh

3388~~~
He is finished. Completely dead

3389~~~
Terrible player with a terrible attitude.

3390~~~
That's the most annoying thing about it, bet he still plays the next game despite this performance. Even more frustrating is that he kept him on but subbed Di Maria?

3391~~~
Can we release the bloke early?

3392~~~
I seriously hope I never see him again in our shirt. Shit, uninterested and selfish.

3393~~~
Is there anything more infuriating in football than seeing him feck up and then smugly blow his nose onto the turf?

3394~~~
It's an absolute travesty that this guy is playing for us at the moment. He has been so incredibly terrible throughout the season. His instinct is gone, his pace is nonexistent. His first touch is terrible, his creativity uninspiring.  For a vice captain he is a feeble leader and he has no presence or work ethic to trouble the defense. His finishing is a travesty, movement catastrophic and output appalling.  I think his presence has a negative impact on the team. 

He needs to be dropped.  

Anyone watching Van Persie attempt to play football this season, in his current form, needs to be refunded their hard earned money. feck, if I had his performance in any day job, I'd be sacked. Just shit. Pure shit.

3395~~~
He could do nothing wrong for me until this season. His attitude just seems the worst.And he is so negative when he holds the ball up, takes his usual five touches and then passes it back to the player who is furthest away from goal.

3396~~~
needs dropping, give him away for free.

3397~~~
Shocking how he manages to stay on the pitch for 90 minutes when he puts in such a lacklustre performance. 

LvG's managing of him is starting to grind on me, he needs to play the players in form, not his favourite pet.

3398~~~
Did he actually do anything good this match?

3399~~~
Harsh to blame any individual but cant help but think he's a big reason we lost this game.

He's been shit recently to say the least.

3400~~~
LVG is known for making tough decisions and yet RVP still plays for us.  Falco and RVP need to go.  At least give Wilson the chance at some more game time to learn.  We can buy in the summer.

3401~~~
He needs to go back home to Holland.

3402~~~
Awful.

3403~~~
I think I was bigger danger to Swansea's goal from my chair than. If van Gaal keeps playing him he deserves to be sacked just for that.

3404~~~
Back from injury and gets picked. Him and Falcao gone in summer please.

400k saved on wages.

3405~~~
Sorry, i'm not normally critical of United players, but how he gets back in to the team straight away based on his performances this season is baffling. He's been so lethargic most of the season. Even at the end when we had a free kick, he just jogged up to the ball as if we weren't losing 2 fecking 1.

3406~~~
Not wishing him a serious injury or so but atm I just hope he will be sidelined

3407~~~
Ok so came in to expect the usual amount of drivel after a game. I thought he was our worst player yes, but to say some suggestions of "he's finished", " should never wear the shirt again" quite frankly is embarrassing.

3408~~~
Criminal that he keeps getting picked. Looked completely out of it today.

3409~~~
Definitely yes. He has been terrible for a long while now.

3410~~~
When you're slinging justified abuse at him, I just want to make sure none of you forget how subtle his movement can be.

3411~~~
Nah I'm sorry but he needs to go. He's in such a sharp decline, might as well get some money out of him.

Play 1 striker up front for the love of god. 2 has barely ever worked for us this season.

3412~~~
Needs to be moved on at season's end.  Wonderful for the two previous season's yes but he's clearly past it now.

3413~~~
His worst performance in a United shirt? I mean I've seen him have bad games where he lacked involvement but today he was actively hampering us in attack, shooting with his weak foot, passing it backwards or off target.

3414~~~
It is so subtle he has forgotten to actually you know.. run?

3415~~~
Yeah, wasn't good today- a few decent touches here and there (hit the bar from tight angle) but his shooting was off and he could hardly walk for the last 10 minutes after that cross. He was a lot more involved in the first half than he's been in games with Falcao next to him but I think we should bench him now and play Rooney up with Fellaini/Mata behind.

3416~~~
Had about as much effect on that game before and after he was injured.

3417~~~
Average rating: 5.7
Your rating: 3.0

That about sums up my opinion of him. Haven't seen him have a good game since 2012.

3418~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3419~~~
Damn, mine is only 4.1.

3420~~~
He's been getting a free ride for ages because everyone focused on Falcao. He has been very underwhielming for most of the season.

3421~~~
I think he needs to go at the end of the season. Has the mobility of a vending machine.

3422~~~
I think only he and Rooney are undroppable to Van Gaal. Mata and Herrera have been victims of this at times this season.

3423~~~
I wonder if van Gaal’s trust in van Persie might get him sacked, because I really believe it is a big problem.

3424~~~
Even I was flipping out after he missed that chance in the second half <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Still he managed to hit the crossbar, did any of our attacking players come closer to scoring a goal today? I don't remember, which is pretty telling. We have some serious issues.

3425~~~
I agree.

3426~~~
RvP needs to move on. LvG needs to get out there and buy a proper striker this summer.

3427~~~
Maybe the best thing for us. Sorry Robin. But Van Gaal would play him against Sunderland for 90 minutes too.

3428~~~
RVP had 7 shots but hit the target once...

3429~~~
Back to Falcao then. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3430~~~
Lol Solius you are a trumpet but that made me laugh!

3431~~~
How did he get injured ? He did fecking nothing. He blew his nose too fecking hard ?

3432~~~
A massive off game for RVP today. Really struggling at times this season. Blowing hot and cold and unfortunately, more often cold. There was nothing on display today to say he's a better option than Falcao right now.

If he's injured, in the most peculiar way, being out of the team for a while may prove beneficial for him... if there's an opening left for him to return back to of course.

3433~~~
I hope he is injured - not badly mind - but enough to keep him out of the team for a while. Way off form for too long now. LVG needs to be ruthless with him. Really like RVP but we can't afford to cater to his or anyone else's ego this season if we're to get top four.

3434~~~
His Body language was shocking at times.

3435~~~
Might be a blessing in disguise. lets wait and see.

3436~~~
Looks finished almost as much as falcao, mata should be given a run in the team behind Rooney.laying two strikers doesn't work we need to stop trying it but we have been doing it all season so no doubt it will continue. For me our forwards have been a problem all season and RVP and Falcao should be confined to the bench, RVP could do. Job for a year as a backup but that is about it.

3437~~~
He just looks disinterested to me, lazy, slow and devoid of any real effort, Serie A awaits.

3438~~~
Thankfully that means he should miss the next few games. Hopefully we don't resort to Falcao though as that will be the same shit in a different package pretty much. Will only be a blessing if it means we switch to a 1 up front (being Rooney) and start using the likes of Mata and Herrera consistently and properly.

3439~~~
The worst thing is his body language, just doesn't seem to care anymore tbh. 

He has to be benched.

3440~~~
Oh joy

3441~~~
shocking how this guy can make starting XI every week. I like his touch which is much better than Rooney's but that is not enough, he can run about 60minutes then he is out of engine, maybe he could take a breath on the bench of some oxygen if you know what I mean? If anything he could make at least one fecking goal from his 5 decent chances. Shelvey took the first one and he is a wanker. This friendship must end. This trio up fron two rigid strikers and another clumsy player like Fellaini is far from ideal and we stick to it. 

FFS, FFS, FFS, FFS, how many games do we need to play with two rigid strikers and hoof the ball to fellaini to find out it's not the way. Fellaini did his job about well but his never ending fouls.. it's annoying and he really kills a lot of attack for us by doing so, sometimes it's a good to change the tactics but why don't we play on the ground, but it would still be useless because we have got two striekrs who are not able to do anythig up front due to their absolute lack of movement and skills. My god we started to play with them upfront in the beginning of the season and they were awful all the time, it doesn't work. 

Weak up Van Gaal

3442~~~
He is a sore loser. When the going gets tough he withers. It happened at Arsenal and it's happened in the last 18 months. This guy over the years has been quietly accused of being the kid in school who sucks up to the teacher but is a snide guy in actual fact. For all the stick Rooney gets I haven't heard about him going up to the manager and try and persuade him that "player x is crap" essentially. Think the player in question was Ramsey. Or the several tensions involving him at the national team.

Back to the on pitch stuff. You can see he wants to score more to a prolific level again but he isn't willing to do the hard work to get there. When you get to an age where you have to lead through experience and have to sacrifice some parts of your game to stay on longer you need to adapt. You need to adapt to work with the other players who have the directness you once had. I don't think he is willing to do so. I think his body language shows a man who is frustrated with himself but in a deluded manner keeps thinking that things will work out. Well guess what, it's still all crap.

3443~~~
And most of those misses weren't "near" misses, they were terrible attempts.

3444~~~
Our slow and static strikers are hampering our game in a big way. I'm not claiming they are the only problem, but they are really not helping us at all. Players like Herrera, Mata and Di Maria would thrive at clubs like Chelsea and City where there is quicker movement ahead of them. (I know Mata was allowed to leave Chelsea but that was more to do with his work rate than his ability going forward) 

Herrera, Di Maria, Mata, Januzaj are all suffering because our strikers are not performing and the whole team looks laboured going forward.

3445~~~
How he keeps starting games is beyond me, he has had a terrible year. I don't think his body can handle English football anymore, just seems so slow, doesn't make runs either.

3446~~~
I would actually rather we play Smalling as a striker than Falcao.
I am deadly serious about this.

Falcao is slow/static and has no redeeming qualities. Also, his confidence is going to be very low, which is a huge issue, especially for strikers.

3447~~~
Seems to me like he's taken over as the whipping boy of the caf....replacing Rooney. He wasn't great today but he's our top scorer this and still offers great hold up play.

Not sure how people can conclude he doesn't look bothered either. But that's the caf for you. Player doesn't play well=Doesn't look bothered.

3448~~~
Wouldn't be in disguise at all. Just a blessing.

3449~~~
We let Chicha and Welbeck go. At the start of the season, on paper our attacking players were considered to be amoung the best in the league. Now the trio of Wayne, Robin and Radamel brings little hope, and I am actually not really optimistic about having all these players being a year older next season.

3450~~~
TBF the best of our chances fell to RVP which is why.

3451~~~
We're either giving RVP flack or Falcao or  the other way around, can people just not see? Rooney was just as bad, hardly in the game as have all our strikers been in every game when we use Fellaini as our target man, they are supposed to feed off Fellaini. Question is why?
Our strikers are far better than that, the emphasis should be put on them and not Fellaini, LVG has got this all wrong and our striker are suffering because of it

3452~~~
If keeping the ball for ten seconds too long after receiving it near the opposition box and laying it all the way back to our defenders at least 5 times per game is considered as great hold up play to you then you should give up on watching football.

3453~~~
Swinging that right boot too hard.

3454~~~
Rooney wasn't bad at all and was in the game. He deferred to RVP though regarding being the one getting into position for the chances.

3455~~~
I can understand the criticism from people today, particularly when most weren't happy with him before. I don't think he was as bad as the majority on here, but he should have made more with the chances he got. The second half we resorted to playing long ball into Fellaini and at that point he became anonymous- before that though he was more involved in our play than has been in several weeks.

What annoys me however, is when people come in to the thread to post things like 'hasn't had a good game since 2012' which is clearly not true. The same happened with Valencia when his form went out of the window, people started adding an extra 6-12 months as to how long it had been or saying about his leg break that was at fault when he won PoTY the season after.

3456~~~
Agree with that, though I'm not under the impression RVP gets more (unfair) criticism than the other players on here.

3457~~~
Except it's not, he was crap last season, he's been crap this, if it carries on he will have been piss poor for two out of three seasons here.....

3458~~~
I agree with the notion that he was far more involved than he has been in our matches for a good long while. If only he'd looked as sharp as he did against Burnley as well. 

It's shitty... We looked comfortable, we were bossing them away from home, it looked like a matter of time before we nabbed a winner, they score a flukey goal and we never string together a period where we look likely to score again. It sucks, and we all love a scapegoat for this sort of thing, but some of the flak RvP is getting after this match is ridiculous. He's deserved it way more in a number of matches this season.

3459~~~
I just wish we had at least one good striker!!! Who would have believe me last summer if I would have said that Rooney, Falcao and Persie weren't good enough? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  They can all leave next summer If the will not perform better the rest of the season.

3460~~~
He looked so good agaisnt Southamptom away. I thought he was over his patchy form then.

3461~~~
Think the story was that Ramsey and Van Persie came to blows in the dressing room after a game against Man City that we won 1-0 where Ramsey refused to square it to RVP and instead shot himself. Then he went to Wenger and said that we used to have Fabregas, Henry and others but now we have players who clearly aren't good enough, not naming anyone but clearly meaning Ramsey  Apparently he wasn't well liked by some at Arsenal. Same as Alex Song who squared up to Bould one day in training and the next week he was off to Barcelona.

Of course Van Persie was different as we wanted to keep him. Also I have no idea if any of the above is true as I wasn't personally there and Van Persie denied it but that's the story

3462~~~
Holy shit his injury might be a blessing in disguise..  Hope this is his last game for us..

3463~~~
Been dreadful most of this season, the goals he has scored have covered this up.  Not a team player for me, either.

I don't mind 'over-reacting' - never warmed to him very much to start with.

3464~~~
As one of the biggest RvP fans around, it's really sad to see how his level has dropped.

The fact he's still our best #9 says a lot about the squad.

3465~~~
He needs to be sold in the summer, i will always be grateful for #20 but he really needs to move one now, he doesn't deserve to start let alone be our main striker

3466~~~
Agree with you. I'm also a huge fan and it's remarkable how a guy who single-handedly propelled us to the league title can now barely muster a decent effort on goal. Even more remarkable to think it was only a short while ago that he mesmerised the whole world with that header at the World Cup. What has happened to him?

He's a very special player, reminds me of Cantona, Zidane, Bergkamp - that style of effortless genius - but he's a shadow of his former self right now. Really hope he can turn it around because his style of play suggests that he could be great for a few more years if he can get it together again.

3467~~~
Though it probably wasn't his worst game of the season, it is ever more evident that his time at the club is coming to a close. He just looks slow, lethargic and even his goal scoring instincts seem to have betrayed him. Such a shame to se him as a shadow of that powerful, artistic and ruthless striker who played with that hunger and desire to win title 20 for us, but both the club and the player need to move on.

3468~~~
He really does look past it now, and I agree that this injury may be a blessing in disguise. Aside from that header, he was awful in the World Cup too.

3469~~~
He's getting damned by the general hysteria alright. Made a mess of a few half chances but his all round play today was better than it has been in most games he's played this season.  

I still think he's finished just funny that this game seems to have caused such a big swing in opinions. He's been much worse many times before. Actually wasn't bad today.

3470~~~
I was just going to say the same thing. LvG kept Fellaini on even though he was poor because he wanted to lump long balls towards him but how are we even going to get to the final third without our fastest player in di Maria? I cannot justify that sub except by saying van Gaal is ridiculously biased towards RvP.

3471~~~
Why are some fans so sentimental? 

He's terrible, he's only in the team because he's LVG's adopted child. 

Do you think someone like mourinho would stand for his attitude? No, if it was Jose he would've sold him a season ago and that's why Chelsea are where they are and why we have dropped way out of contention.

3472~~~
Has LvG seriously cocked up here. Rushing RvP back instead of the proving your fitness thing he has. Now he is injured again.

3473~~~
How did he manage to look and play so good with a team of rubbish behind him,  and now he has quality players alongside and behind and looks so poor. I am beginning to question his desire and hunger, and I also think the injuries he has had during his career have taken their toll. Both him and Falcao looked crocked.

3474~~~
That's the main thing people linked with Manchester United have forgotten: being ruthless and show zero sentimentality towards any single player. If Van Gaal wants to save his own ass first, he better drop Van Persie just like he dropped Falcao.

Rooney+Wilson from now on for starting XIs. If Van Persie wants to carry on as a sub in the near future, he's more than welcome. Otherwise, he's of no use as a starter.

3475~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/xPEtqEi.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/xPEtqEi.jpg"/>

3476~~~
Only now? Didn't see him pick and choose when he was fit under Moyes? I think he has put a better effort in this season, albeit for worse performances but I can accept that but not the lack of desire.

3477~~~
It was a tackle to be fair

3478~~~
Sorry to say it but it can only be good for us. 3 goals in his last 11 games and the performances have been crap. 

Time to play Rooney up top with Mata behind him.

3479~~~
He has been terrible  as bad as Falcao with less excuses (no ACl injury, not a new league, plays 90 minutes most times etc). He is done imo. Serie A done.

3480~~~
Stop it. You are takling far too much sense here. Join the bandwagon, they have cookies!

3481~~~
His finishing was rubbish today but it was good to see him get more involved at least.
Never expected it to be the case at the start of the season but I think our strikers (and front 3 in general) have been the weak link in the team this season.
Wouldn't be at all surprised if hererra finishes with more goals than them at the end of this season.

3482~~~
*Please be broken*

3483~~~
He was terrible today but I still support him and have faith that he will reproduce some of his best form. I can't believe I am seeing people say they hope his injury is severe. That is typical impulsive fan talk which this club has seen far too much of over the years. I reckon his absence may bring out the best in Falcao but if it doesn't then we are really fecked upfront.

3484~~~
He's suited for a one striker formation, the box is too cramped for him when he has to play with another. There was a reason Fergie rarely played him and Rooney together upfront and tried best to offload Rooney in his last season.

3485~~~
He is.

3486~~~
Poor

3487~~~
I know, he's been really poor.

3488~~~
It might be a blessing in disguise if RVP is injured but not if falcao comes back in, he is even worse and is going backwards, hopefully mata will get the chance to play with Rooney.

A player who basically won us the league title doesn't deserve a post like that.

3490~~~
I'm sure his £200k a week salary will soften the blow.

3491~~~
good for you to support a player who is performing poorly two seasons in a row. I guess I was sorta the same with Anderson and some other players. In fact every player should be supported but this is really not United standard so I guess people are quite happy with the injury because he looks like he will play in any case for Van Gaal as it's his protection boy:-)

And I don't know why but I never liked him that much, apart his first season he looks like he doesn't give a single feck on the pitch, not playing for the bedge etc.. Still looks like stranger in United team. Not that he didn't settle well, he did but I can see him in Arsenal jersey. Apart that SAF season when he gave him extra motivation he looks awkward..

3492~~~
was bad

3493~~~
What did Rooney do that was so much better than RVP? He wasnt good but at least got involved offensively and got himself in some positions. It's no mystery that RVP will never be as good as he was 2 seasons ago, but this really looks like scapegoating.

3494~~~
He was shit last season under moyes and everyone put that down to moyes mismanagement and he would be rejuvenated under LVG his Dutch manager who share a mutual understanding, but he has been crap.  He had one game this season up to the standard you expect of him, away to Southampton, aside from the 2 goals he scored in that game it was his body language, effort and movement that stood out like he did in his 1st season here under SAF, he just does not do that any more, don't know if he is physically incapable or just not motivated but he is not doing it and IMO his time is up to lead the line in our attack.

3495~~~
There has been a few posts in this thread where I have thought that exact same thing.

That doesn't mean I think he has been good or anything though, far from it. He has been very poor and is an issue (along with our other strikers) in this team. His finishing has gone to wank also. There were a few passages in the first half where he was quite good, but for the most part he didn't do enough. Dropping him or a blessing in disguise injury is basically pointless because it just leaves us with Falcao again - and we know how that goes.

3496~~~
Love the guy but this spell out may be a blessing in disguise. Hope the injury's not too serious, mind.

3497~~~
He's been practically useless this season. Don't care if he's top scorer.

3498~~~
I have been supporting LVG from the start but the way he is handling RVP is just ridiculous. Robin has been woeful to say the least all season yet he keeps on playing formations to fit him in the starting eleven.

3499~~~
Never wanna see a player get injured, but I won't miss see him not playing...

3500~~~
It's come to the point where it's our only choice as LVG refuses to drop him.

3501~~~
He is awful these days <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That half arsed effort on goal when Rooney fell in the box summed him up

3502~~~
Why not use wilson?
Could be a good opportunity for him. 

I understand van gaal continuing to pick van persie to be fair because the alternatives have been worse mostly.
Not convinced rooney is cut out to be stuck up front on his own anymore.
Guess we might find out next week though.

3503~~~
If LVG won't take him out of the starting 11, then we need to believe that injury has done us a favour instead. He's been living off his reputation for long enough. Unfortunately he was the recipient of our best chances today. His finishing has become really shocking recently which is made even worse by how few clear opportunities our strikers get these days. 

We need to buy a mobile striker in the summer who can really stretch defences. We can't persist with such a lack of penetration up front any more.

3504~~~
Also leaves us with the hope of Mata behind Rooney, which is what most on here are hoping for really. It's just a hope that it'll happen though, far more likely is Falcao as you say.

3505~~~
It's an option but to be honest I don't think he would impress much. He is still raw and has a lot of improving to do. All our strikers seem to be on about the same level (average/poor) so it probably doesn't make a difference who plays.

3506~~~
Did you not watch the away game vs Southampton or home vs Chelsea? He's still capable of saving games out of half chances, he's just playing poorly in a formation that doesn't quite suit him.

3507~~~
He's gone. Couldn't even be arsed moving later in the game and his finishing has gone to shit. Thanks for the title Robin but you're off at the end of the season.

3508~~~
How long is he out for? Please be long..

3509~~~
I'd agree with that but playing him seems a pretty good solution to that problem. Not like any of the others are making a great case for being picked ahead of him.

3510~~~
Very good.

3511~~~
I've got his contribution to the team nailed down to the following:
<ul>
<li>Receive ball.</li>
<li>Ignore easy pass to fellow striking partner.</li>
<li>Take shot on when others in better position OR</li>
<li>Ball is stolen by opposition. </li>
<li>Don't chase down the ball (if more than 25 minutes into game, because the legs have gone).</li>
<li>Clear snot from left nostril. </li>
<li>Clear snot from right nostril. </li>
<li>Jog back into position.</li>
</ul>

3512~~~
I thought his first half was pretty good as his hold up play was excellent and he was in good positions. His second half was very poor however and I think he deserves the slack he's getting post match.

3513~~~
No more good enough at this levels, let him come back to Feyenoord.

Wilson deserves a chance

3514~~~
RVP has been off his game for us since Fergie retired. Under Moyes it was the mysterious injury that enabled him to be ready for Holland. During the WC his performance dropped alarmingly after the first game and by the end of the tournament he looked older than LVG. This season there has been a few cameos performances of his former self but overall his trajectory is declining. We can't continue to hope he will restore his form from 2012-13 season - that's gone forever.

3515~~~
Still does a good job leading the line and holding the ball up, he had a poor day with his finishing. It happens. Unfortunately we had nobody the manager trusted to come off the bench and try and score a goal to replace him when it was clear that he was off his game

3516~~~
We really do need to buy a top quality striker, but until then Rooney should starting up front.

3517~~~
I'm sure somebody pointed this out further above but his hold up play these days is essentially an exercise of controlling the ball - which he still does well - labouring on the ball for a good five seconds, allowing the opposition to get back into position, doing that daft roll over trick to waste another few seconds and then releasing the ball back to where it came from.

If people are impressed by that then I don't really know what to say.

3518~~~
Hopefully something thats not full of the nonsense you put above.

3519~~~
Lawro bitch slapping RVP! Should go down a treat.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31574957" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31574957</a>

3520~~~
So he isn't doing exactly that? We're certainly not benefitting from this perceived excellent hold up play in any great way.

If you want a reminder as to how good his genuinely brilliant hold up play could be, go back and watch his performance at the Bernabeu in 2013. He's a long, long way away from that kind of football now.

3521~~~
I've said it before, and I'll say it again: 2nd half against Burnley he almost looked like his old self again, and yesterday against Swansea he actually tried to make things happen, forced the issue when he had the ball and managed to get some shots off... That's more than can be said for a number of games.

Is it a good outing? No. Did he look better than he has for most of the season? Yes. 

It's such a weird time for people to be collectively losing their patience with him. I'd have agreed with people if you said that he's looking like he's done (for the time being) a month or two ago... After yesterday's match, all I can think is that he needs to keep it up and make progress.

3522~~~
For those that think he's not committed, if he cared more about himself than the team he could quite easily have come off injured because he was quite clearly in a lot of pain and discomfort. It's very possible he actually did more damage to himself just by staying on and doing what he could to help the team but for some reason this was just swept under the carpet completely.

3523~~~
Would van Gaal have allowed him to do so? We had no more subs, I'm not sure he'd have felt comfortable allowing us to spend the rest of the game down to 10. A lot of players play through pain, I don't think that's really a significant barometer to measure commitment.

3524~~~
Do you wish injury on every United player that has been shite this season?
If so won't be many if any players left.
Eh?

3525~~~
strong post to user name correlation

3526~~~
Hate to say this, but given LVG's insistence on playing him, I hope he's out for a while. Slow, predictable, boring. Never thought I'd use those adjectives to describe him after his first season with us but he's been poor since then. A real disappointment.

3527~~~
Having him out could be good for us, he has not produced in a while, but it could also mean a recall for Falcao which I dont want.

3528~~~
Exactly, with RVP out Wilson should step in his place, not Falcao.

3529~~~
Hopefully a midfielder takes his position, and we play with just one striker.

3530~~~
I have a soft spot for Van Persie tbh. His first season with us was just incredible. The fact we signed him was a dream, the 'little boy inside me was screaming United' quotes and the way in which he singlehandedly won us number 20. That season he was simply magical in the premier league. I will always be thankful to him for that.
He hasn't been the greatest for us for a while now but honestly have any of our players. I haven't seen fluidity in successive games since Fergies last year and that is when RVP was at his best.

3531~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3532~~~
Would prefer a proper 4231 with mata then Young and di Maria wide. Blind and herrera midfield and Shaw and rafael as wing backs. That will be exciting and quick, but also should have goals.

3533~~~
His very presence in the starting 11 is incredibly annoying, most people knew before the game he wasn't going to offer anything and he is badly out of form. Funny how the one rule for everyone doesn't apply to RVP or any of LVG's mates, what happened to needing 2 weeks on the bench to recover from an injury?

3534~~~
Too true - Falcao & Rooney do it too tbf. None of them can actually turn on the ball as they're too slow and laboured and just cannot play with their backs to goal. Control ball driven into feet an pass back to our half..or lose possession due to miscontrols. Rarely do you see one take it on the half turn and be able to protect it either, hence the backwards pass.

3535~~~
It still annoys me that we only got a season-and-a-half of this Van Persie, but what a phenomenal player he was:

<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/120343063" width="500"></iframe>

3536~~~
He has been shit last year, even if he managed to score 18 goals, and he has been awful this year when he was always in the starting XI. In 25 games so far his production has been poor, very poor from a player able to give us the title just 2 years ago.

In my opinion, Van Gaal has to be intransigent with every player. He has been rude with Welbeck because he was not good enough, so what about RVP?

I like Robin and what he did for his first year, but he has been poor this season, so if LVG his honest with himself he will let him leave this summer

3537~~~
Same but I would play Herrera in the number 10 role and put Fellani in midfield with Blind. Mata is a wonderful talent but I prefer the physicality and energy that Fellani and Herrera bring respectively.

3538~~~
Can't argue with that. I think Herrera would be a decent 10, I just don't think he would make enough forward attacking runs to suppliment the attack. He can finish, but he is more about controlling the midfield and looking for a pass. I suppose in the tougher games Fellaini would be better though to get stuck in.

3539~~~

http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31574957</a>

3540~~~
His last season at arsenal and his first season with us, he was probably the best no.9 in the world. such a shame we only got to see a glimpse of it.

3541~~~
A part of me thinks he regrets moving to United. He came here for Fergie and only got him for a year before being managed by Moyes. He may have won a title, but in the form he was in he could have won one for Arsenal, and maybe more.

3542~~~
He could have won a title with Arsenal? 
Are you sure?

3543~~~
I wouldnt mind Wilson replacing him alongside Rooney, but the kid has been very up and down.

It may be better to try Rooney as lone striker with Mata behind.

3544~~~
Well you never know, they were top of the table until February last season.

Though you could argue RVPs departure allowed for signings such as Ozil and Sanchez.

3545~~~
There were few season when they were on top and then they would eventually collapsed. Even when RVP was there.

3546~~~
I agree about the van Persie part. However, he suggests van Gaal should give Rooney - Falcao 6 games and then judge them. 
We might as well give this time to Wilson because they both have pretty poor first touch, Wilson is at least a fast runner so he will keep the defence closer to their goal.

3547~~~
Van Persie is one of my favourite United players, but he has been shocking recently. He looks so tired all the time. I thought he would thrive under LVG. 

So many times against Swansea he picked up the ball and shot wildly. Has he ever worked well with another strike partner? 

I have a bit more sympathy for Falcao. He is coming back from a serious injury and adjusting to a new league. But RVP has been poor for the past 18 months.

3548~~~
Playing like he knows he isn't getting a contract and I will always appreciate his 1st season as he looked absolutely class - but I think he is pretty much done now. Didn't look like he was enjoying it last year and doesn't look much better now, our striking options look a little fecked at the moment.

3549~~~
Who would have thought that at the start of the season?

3550~~~
As long as LVG is here so will RVP. Which is very worrying.

3551~~~
I know, so depressing, especially when you think of that first 55-60 mins v Leicester, RVP, Rooney, Di Maria and Falcs all linking up superbly - I was so excited until <i>that </i>penalty. 

Now it just looks like we are scrambling around to find someone to give us some inspiration... worrying times.

3552~~~
He got screwed over by SAF when he got told by him he would be here atleast 3years. Look at what he has to deal with now, tbf i would have been a bit pissed myself.

In spite of that he should play better, but maybe age has just taken it's toll quickly.

3553~~~
Van Persie only ever gave 2 consistent seasons where he looked like the best center forward in the world, one of those was for us. We firmly knew the risk that comes with him and while he got a grip over his injuries, he's mentally not been the same player after Ferguson left.

3554~~~
But he fell lucky when LVG took over, he can have no complaints about the manager or how he's been supported this season. I think he's just getting on.

3555~~~
I don't think a striker of Van Persie's caliber gets shit to the extent that he has without some underlying issue.  I feel that he is jaded after the crap of last season (us being crap the constant media turmoils and being pissed at fergie) and then the world cup.

3556~~~
Any news on how severe his injury is?

3557~~~
RVP needs to go, Giroud  is only 8 goals behind RVP since the 2012/13 season

3558~~~
Agree. It is depressing just thinking about how it will all play out. The combination of declining athleticism and modest finishing is a real killer.

2014/5 8 non-penalty goals in the PL from 55 shots inside the box - conversion rate 14.5% (excludes pens and goals/shots from outside the box)
2013/4 9 non-penalty goals in the PL from 53 shots inside the box - conversion rate 17%
2012/3 20 non-penalty goals in the PL from 98 shots inside the box - conversion rate 20%

The list of PL strikers who convert more than 14.5% of their shots taken inside the box, is a long one. The out of form Hernandez was at 22% last season, 27% in 2012/3. Mame Diouf is at 18% this season. Frazier Campbell 21%. Harry Kane and Diego Costa about 30%. (Stats from Squawka)

3559~~~
Out for 6 weeks I am hearing

3560~~~
Quick somebody tell Jones to injure Falcao!

3561~~~
Let's celebrate rvp being injured when our other options have been worse and let's play a kid up front who looks out of his depth when he starts. Caf logic

3562~~~
Giroud playing 600 more minutes.

Source?

3563~~~
Wouldn't have minded if he missed a week or 2 but that's not good for us, includes some pretty big matches

3564~~~
Has Falcao really been worse? They've scored the same number of goals since the Villa game (and one of RVP's was a penalty) and Falcao has more assists. People have just been focusing so much on Falcao that Van Persie has gotten an easier ride, he's been out of form for a while.

3565~~~
But we have the mighty James Wilson who has the incredible 1 goal to his name and Rooney who had one shot on goal in 2015. We're sorted. I'm more perplexed as to why mata has been left out too. Arguably one of our better players over Xmas time.

3566~~~
And stats mean nothing here because everyone with their own eyes can see that Falcao can't trap a bag of sand. He's been a massive disappointment. When rvp isn't playing well at least he still gets the basics right.

3567~~~
Getting the basics right while barely breaking into a sweat and not putting any effort in. At least Falcao gives everything. Swings and roundabouts.

3568~~~
Maybe it's hindsight but I'm sure I remarked to myself near the end of the World Cup that RVP looked completely shot after scoring that flying header. Was never the same after that moment.

3569~~~
Exactly. Both Robin and Radamel look past their best, but Falcao is at least giving his all and is in wars against opposition, despite the horrendous injury that he will hardly ever recover from. Another serious injury will kill his career altogether. As for Robin, he does not seem to be that much arsed.

3570~~~
It's definitely not hindsight. He did his meniscus against Olympiakos, a well documented injury, not a mystery like some on here suggest. He recovered in time, but didn't play a full proper match leading up to the World Cup. He picked up another knock during the preparation and wasn't really fit when the tournament started. Against Spain he only lasted 70 minutes, and he looked knackered after 60.

Still scored two and hit the crossbar within 70 minutes in that game though. He was subbed off regularly during the World Cup because he simply wasn't fit enough to last 90 minutes. Yet he still outscored a lot of players in that tournament. That's why I'm not too worried about his physical decline - time waits for no one. But with his qualities it's not really an excuse.

3571~~~
So...would you say he's simply struggling to regain full fitness or is he done?

3572~~~
And I'm sure that's never far from his mind when he plays. Could be why he's having a tough time at United.

3573~~~
A bit of both at the moment. If you look at Saturday's game, it was quite obvious he was rushed back. I know Van Gaal is his mate and all, but he didn't exactly do him a favour now did he, especially since Van Persie didn't look fresh and got injured again. Still he hit the crossbar, and got one good chance he really should've scored. That's what I mean with fitness not really being an excuse with him.

3574~~~
The only positive, is that we can actually give Falcao a proper go as THE main front man, rather than as part of a similar pair.

3575~~~
Hes played quite a few games without RVP since the new year and been shite.

3576~~~
Not a proper run, with Rooney behind him.

We might well end up with Rooney up front and Mata off him though. Which might be the best solution all round

3577~~~
I'd go for the latter, Falcao off the bench, his performances of late haven't deserved a start and not sure why Mata has been dropped.

3578~~~
Sod all the strikers. Playing RVP and Falcao together feels like playing with 9 men. Let's just play a Del Bosque "If I'm not playing Torres, I'm not playing anyone" 4-6-0 false 9 formation. It seems like Herrera, Fellaini and Mata look more likely to score in most games than our centre forwards.

Boss.

3579~~~
Ship him here, in Montreal, in the MLS. His level should be perfect in this league if he can't cut it anymore in the PL. Besides, the Montreal Impact are looking for a replacement to the retired Marco Di Vaio.

Back on the current situation, we will have to accept that both he and Falcao are finished in top flight football as far as they are concerned. The sooner we make moves to get younger strikers, the quicker we will have our striker department revitalized.

3580~~~
I've thought this too. He was so fired up with Fergie in clinching the title and he loved every minute of it. Out of all the players he lapped it up the most. Then everything changed at a point when he thought, as well as the fans that we were beginning a new era under Fergie with a young team, and the worst of the Glazer effect behind us.

In hindsight he left Arsenal just as they were coming out of their transition period and financially could join the big boys after repaying the stadium debt and FFP coming into play. And he joined United with Fergie supposedly hiding his retirement plans, and in the end joined a club entering transition. Although you'd argue a 29 year old man should be able to make a career call and it would have been naive on his part if he didn't consider that Fergie at 70 was coming to the end. He would have been a legend at Arsenal.

3581~~~
I see his near future taking place in the MLS. He is losing is ability to be a top class striker dramatically, and I'm sad to say we won't get the 2012-2013 player that we had back.

3582~~~
Class player, he needs to heal up properly and seems to be carrying a lot of injuries. We were blessed considering his injury list at Arsenal to get that perfect full season out of him. Now it seems to be a curse when he is able to play a game because LVG has so much faith in his ability, the reality is that he is just not fit enough and is only doing harm to the team and his game atm.

3583~~~
Was it not the moneyball guy Comoli who claimed that in the Premier League strikers generally go into sharp decline after the age of thirty?

3584~~~
Has that six weeks been confirmed anywhere?

3585~~~
It is the best solution imo. And I know it's not popular but I'd actually switch back to a back 3 and pack the midfield until the end of the season...

------------------------DDG--------------------
-----Smalling---------Jones----------Rojo-----
Valencia----------------------------------Young
-------Herrera---------Blind---------ADM-------
---------------Mata------------Rooney----------

3586~~~
Was surprised to see he had scored 10 goals his season this morn. 

Its still not good enough, but if he kept playing he could finish the season with 15-17 thats not awful. Im not supporting him or any of the others as they've been terrible. But I was thinking all our strikers were under 7 goals.

3587~~~

3588~~~
Not wishing injury on a player, but that's a blessing in disguise. He needs to be dropped and it's unlikely he would be if he wasn't injured unfortunately.

3589~~~
I think this is a blessing. RVP was awful at the weekend and even though LVG clearly supports him, he might have had to bench him this coming weekend anyway. This saves both LVG from making the decision and RVP from losing face.

3590~~~
It should be a blessing... but then it might just mean Falcao gets put in the starting XI again...

3591~~~
Most of the people calling this a blessing will come back crawling in this thread and pray for him to return after a few games with Falcao playing up front.

3592~~~
I doubt it, the current RVP is nowhere near good enough for Manchester United, same for Falcao too, let's hope he can up his game.

3593~~~
Well it is a blessing... If we play Rooney upfront alone with Mata in behind.

3594~~~
<b>Here is how the rest of his career will pan out...</b>

He will win Utd the FA Cup by scoring a spectacular winner against Liverpool in Wembley

After going through a tough patch in his career, like many great older intelligent players he will reinvent his game and experience a Renaissance.

In his last season at Utd he will show his quality in the CL and end his career at the club by scoring a crucial goal in a CL final victory.

He will move to Feyenoord where he will  be appointed as captain.

He will lead Feyenoord to an Eredivisie title and on the last day of the season he will be carried aloft on the shoulders of his team mates

Finally he will end his career by playing one season at his first ever club Excelsior Rotterdam

3595~~~
Or not.

3596~~~
Blessing in disguise? Ofcourse now we can see that overpaid Columbian screwing every chance, losing every battle, losing every ball and not even getting the basics right. At least RvP has brilliant hold up play at times, he had a decent first half vs Swansea, cant remember last time Falcao had one. Will go mad if I see him start up front alone.

Hope he fully heals from his injury, he hasnt looked fit for a long long while.

3597~~~
I can't see the tweet, can someone please tell me what it says.

3598~~~
If RVP's injury means more Falcao, then this is not a good thing at all.

3599~~~
LvG hasn't played him to his strenghts either, i'm not saying that is a good excuse for him but when Fergie was here the team was build around him so he would flourish.
That being said, i don't think we can rely on him anymore, he should be a backup here next season or be sold.

3600~~~
It's been removed, but I think the tweet when it was up said ankle swelling made it hard to get an accurate assessment but early reports suggested 2-3 weeks out.

3601~~~
Why is everyone assuming RVP getting injured means Falcao will start? It could mean that we will switch to one up top with that player being Rooney.

3602~~~
He's our best striker. He's been partnered with completely the wrong partner in Falcao, and has no one wide playing the ball into him. 

Fully fit and confident RvP would still rattle goals in. He'll go in the summer I think, and score a shed load next season.

3603~~~
Rumours that he's out for 6 weeks from Twitter ITK accounts now too. Over to LVG tomorrow to confirm I guess.

3604~~~
Assuming RVP is injured for a few weeks I think the manager won't play the diamond in the big matches and with Young giving his all and looking more dangerous now he likes to use his left foot I can see the 4-2-3-1 with Mata behind Rooney happening soon as preparation for the big matches.

The manager also has the option of Rooney behind Falcao if he is of the opinion Rooney would be better for his work rate in the big matches.

Alternatively we could see the return of 3-1-4-2.

3605~~~
DOnt think he'll score shed load next season but he should have a better parner, Falcao and him are too look alike as players.
He's not as good as he used to be though, that's for sure.

3606~~~
If that happens Ill be very happy and I reckon we can turn things around and end this season strongly with the formation we should have been playing all season. The only downside will be, how happy can we be if Van Gaal arrives at the solution to our conundrum by accident, rather than design? It doesnt bode well for the future. Still, the main thing is qualifying for the CL and if we play that formation I personally think we will.

3607~~~
I've quoted these from the pics thread as I think <a class="username" data-user="82556, @Speak" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82556/">@Speak</a> makes an interesting point here. Its actually something that I seem to remember being mentioned on here after that goal against Chelsea, where RVP took his shirt off. He is, without doubt looking a lot leaner thesedays. He looks to have really slimmed down, and lost quite a lot of his muscle mass.

I also did a bit of digging and I've come across this article from his first season here..

</i>
To me, this explains a lot. The main issue with RVP this season (imo) is his lack of physicality. He looks slower, more laboured, and lot weaker. In his first season here he'd hold the ball up with real strength, and constantly brush defenders off, showing unexpected strength in the process. And here he is, from that time, putting his form down to that physical strength. So why is he looking leaner now? Why has he lost that muscle (that he claims helped him play better), and could that be the main reason he's looking so shot thesedays?

3608~~~
To hazard a guess, I'd say the fact that after about two and a half seasons pretty much injury free, him having a more typical stop-start season (last season) played a part. I can't remember how long the individual injuries kept him out for or how bad they all were, but they may have made it difficult to keep the muscle on.

He clearly has a slim body type (he'll still look in football shape when he's a grandad) so he obviously put in serious work to get to that size. Maybe it was just unsustainable long term. He's one of those who doesn't appear to gain significant fat or significant muscle without effort. Sort of like how you couldn't imagine Giggs becoming noticeably bulkier and being able to maintain it for very long.

He could really do with that muscle again, but that won't be happening.

Edit: Would be interesting to know when he gained most of that weight. I'm sure he wasn't as big in his last Arsenal games as he was for us on the opening day against Everton.

3609~~~
You make very good points. Its clear from his body type that he obviously had to work hard to put that muscle on. Those injuries last season really did feck him, and us. He'd got himself into his best physical form, and was playing the best football of his career, then last season just fecked it all. I guess that was always the risk when buying a (formerly) injury prone player. There was always the chance it would come back and bite us in the ass, especially as he was getting on a bit (in footballing terms anyway). I don't think we'll ever see that 2012 RVP again <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3610~~~
Probably gained the weight when he spent half his time out injured. Hard to keep muscle on when you're playing every week. Much easier to bulk up when you're not running 10k every weekend.

3611~~~
I'll be interesting to see what happens after a summer with no major championships. I think Ferguson leaving, a bad 13/14 season for the club which included injuries and also his race to get fit for Brazil after the injury against Olympiakos haven't helped along with him being a year older of course. As I've said before, van Persie looks at the stats and won't be happy with what's happened with his form regardless if we finish top 4 or even win the FA Cup. Whether he can do something about it is another question.

3612~~~
Very true. Not sure how I made that connection, now you mention it. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That's the thing - he wasn't injured at any point in about 26 months. Looking at his last few Arsenal goals, he doesn't look particularly bulky. So it seems that he gained the weight during the summer he joined us, which would make sense with the time off. 
But these days he's looking even slimmer than he did back before he gained the weight. Maybe he's approaching things differently as he gets older.

3613~~~
Just had a look at Van Persies stats this season (in the league) compared to last two seasons.

<i>N.B. Only games where RVP played as a CF count, not SS or LW/RW
</i>
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Conclusion:</span></b>

All his stats are down this season except his shot accuracy and key passes. Not good. His general all round game has diminished hugely since SAF left, significant drop in assists, key passes and touches.

3614~~~
Updated the above with 12/13 Season. It's a very worrying drop in form but the question is how much of this is down to the team and change in the tactics or whether its just RvP diminishing. His accuracy is the best its been and yet his conversion rate is the worst and his all round contribution to the team is a shadow of what it once was.

I miss 12/13 RvP <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3615~~~
Maybe he got too heavy with muscles? Of course a player will feel stronger with more muscles, but it's still weight that has to be carrierd around, weight that has inertia, weight that bangs down on all the joints and ligaments with every step. Ibrahimovic once told that he got too muscular, and went to loose about 10 kilos in muscles to regain his agility and quick feet. Maybe Van Persie didn't stay within the boundaries of his natural body type?

3616~~~
Looks like it happened, i'm not sure if it was RVP's absence though, if anything Shaw's injury or whatever is wrong with him is probably the reason for this formation change.

3617~~~
People wanting RVP out just so Falcao can slot right back in... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3618~~~
No, people wanted a 4-2-3-1 with preferably Mata behind Rooney.

Rooney behind Falcao is a start, if Falcao doesn't perform then it will be Mata behind Rooney but if he does then there is no problem.

At least it appears as though we are fielding a formation which will provide more width and pace with Young's inclusion. (Assuming he performs).

I'm not even sure what gave you the idea people wanted Falcao, I think you should go and read the match day thread before you start laughing at things that aren't true, most are saying Falcao is the only thing they would change.

3619~~~
Wonder how different the last few games would've been had RvP not been injured.

3620~~~
I'm slightly concerned van Gaal will drop the 4-3-3 to facilitate van Persie when he returns, hopefully not though.

3621~~~
Today may have not been much different. We are clicking as a team irrespective of who is playing, although, that may have been less the case if RvP was playing instead of Rooney, since the latter is more active in tracking back.

3622~~~
Three or four months ago I would never have said this but providing we can get two good strikers in this summer I think we should seriously consider selling him.

3623~~~
Maybe he's the player that profits the most from this recently found click all over the team.

3624~~~
He'll probably thrive now that we've clicked.

3625~~~
When he comes back where does he go? I say the bench

3626~~~
He'll struggle to make it into our team at the moment, especially ahead of Rooney who, while he was poor today, has been offering more up front than RVP did. He'll certainly still get plenty of game time, but he'll have to work hard if he wants to regain a starting position.

3627~~~
No chance. Not after how good and 'balanced' we've been in the last couple of games. If he was to put him in, he'd most likely put Rooney in for Fellaini, with Van Persie going up top. Be very harsh on Fellaini, though. Should be left on the bench, in my opinion.

3628~~~
Yep, he should give Januzaj some company there.

3629~~~
He'll take Falcao's cameo roll for a few games, maybe get a couple of starts before the end of the season. No way does he walk back into the side.

3630~~~
More likely he'd drop Herrera than Fellaini tbh. But neither should be dropped to facilitate Van Persie.

3631~~~
I like RVP but Rooney simply has so many more facets to his game as a #9. We lose so much by playing RVP up front n my opinion.

3632~~~
Yeah, I'm with this. I'm guessing that RvP will either be gone in the summer or play "bit part striker" role next season.

3633~~~
Our recent for has nothing to do with RVP not playing, it's mainly because of the tactic we are using. I'm sure he can easily play at the same level as Rooney in this team.

Anyway, he'll be on the bench in the first few games for sure, taking over Falcao's role until a spot in the team will be available. He'll basically be in the same situation as Di Maria is now, he has to wait for someone to have a bad game and get dropped to get in.

3634~~~
With our current setup, I think RVP is the better lone striker, but since LVG wants Rooney to play as hes the captain, then if he puts Rooney in midfield or plays 2 strikers, then I think our play will go back to how it was at the start of the season

3635~~~
As harsh as it is, I'd imagine he'll bench Fellaini and ease RvP back in upfront, Rooney will drop a bit deeper. Herrera and Carrick will stay, and it'll be AdM and Mata wide.

3636~~~
I hope he has the balls to do the right thing and move RvP on this summer. Getting rid of his and Falcao's wages alone will allow us to make another world class signings.

3637~~~
I really hope LVG doesn't just bring him back in but I'm worried he will. Rvp seems to have a free pass this season and it won't shock me if LvG were to change his system and play the ridiculous Rooney RvP combo again just to play him.

3638~~~
RvP will be a starter once 100% fit.

3639~~~
That's what I think will happen. And I think it's probably a good way to go.

3640~~~
Playing RvP would be ridiculous. It means removing an effective Fellaini and throwing in a totally ineffective and off form RvP as well as changing the one striker system which is really working well in the last two big games.

3641~~~
With us being a lot more dominant now, who knows, it might just work with RvP. Get him back into some form. 
Nobody can say this doesn't look potentially brilliant. Though the problem of course is having to hope Rooney stays in good form when playing in midfield which is unlikely. Worth a try in the Villa game maybe, but I'd rather just start as we have been and then make subs later on to have this and see how it goes.

3642~~~
van Persie had his best run of games after Carrick came back from injury around November/December, I think having him back will be good for him. However, I think that the form of our midfield and Rooney mean he shouldn't start until he gets back to that level.

3643~~~
I agree. Rooney played absolute wank today yet we had one of the best games of the season I'd say (considering who our opponent was). Plus RvP would probably be better suited as a 9 in this system than Rooney is. People on here seem to treat RvP as a finished donkey like Falcao, when its far from the case

3644~~~
In Rooney we got someone who has some pace to stretch defenses and he does well with Herrera and Mata and is a willing runner who tracks back a lot. RvP in this role has no pace, has already been rubbish this season and certainly wouldn't have chased down the Newcastle defense for our goal the way Rooney did. And he's not even more clinical than Rooney.

3645~~~
RvP won't work. Rooney and RvP have never clicked, and Rooney has far more in his game than a current laborious van Persie as a #9. He should be sold.

3646~~~
Yeah, I agree with this. I mean, I like van Persie but I'd only keep him here if he'll accept a bit part role.

3647~~~
You lot talk like RVP has done nothing for us and doesn't bang in some tasty goals, I love the guy and although it will be harsh to drop someone at this point if RvP does come back with a bit of form he can be a great lift

3648~~~
I'd keep Van Persie as back-up striker to Rooney. He'd be brilliant as a second choice CF, and still has a year left on his contract. Rooney, Van Persie and Wilson make a nice trio for that one spot up front.

3649~~~
No one is denying his past contributions but he's been really poor this season and with whoever he's been paired. He's nowhere near as dynamic as Rooney for this role. He'd be a great option to bring off the bench but I really hope he doesn't waltz back into the first team.

3650~~~
Have people forgotten that RVP was brilliant as a lone striker for Arsenal? He's dynamic playing the role as well, and uses space nicely. I favor him and Rooney alternating for the role and then we can really see who's the better #9. For example when Rooney has another bad game, RVP can sub for him early in the second half, LVG should have the balls to drop his captain when needed and not tinker with the system.

3651~~~
That was what 4 years ago now ? We're never going to see that player again. On top of which, Rooney brings alot more to the position in terms of his movement, work rate, and willingness to track back

3652~~~
Have you forgotten how slow and lethargic he has been this season? Having a £200k+ player playing 'bit part' is very illogical. Free up unneccessary wages.

3653~~~
I know he wasn't great for a while this season, but that goes for a lot of players. I'm talking in respect to the current 4-3-3 system that has got us ticking. We need to see him have a go as a #9 in this system. Assuming we get back in the CL, we will have enough games next season for both he and Rooney to get significant game time. We can afford the wages, especially if they both get going and we get long cup runs and are fighting for the title.

3654~~~
Wow. Ok... For an admin you are remarkably petty. What have I done to you anyway?

3655~~~
If van Gaal puts him back in at the expense of Herrera/Fellaini then I will be annoyed. van Persie has been awful this season. He doesn't merit a spot, I don't care about his nationality.

3656~~~
Hopefully the bench and then the transfer list.

3657~~~
I think you've forgotten Fergie's last season to make such a sweeping statement like that. Hilarious.

3658~~~
next season is the final year of his current contract isn't it? don't think LVG will sell him but he should not be an automatic starter anymore.

but you could not deny his brilliance when he is on form. pity this just doesn't happen too often over the last 2 years.

guess rooney, rvp and wilson will be our CFs with LVG adding another wing forward or two to implement his favoured 4-3-3 system.

3659~~~
Can't see him walking back into the team, but then again we all know how much of a favourite he is of LvG, so it wouldn't be surprising.

In the current setup it would be difficult seeing where he would fit. He's not mobile enough to play the role that Rooney has been for us up top on his own. I wouldn't want to see Rooney moved to midfield, or the left to accommodate him either. It would be very harsh and demotivating should we drop anyone that started yesterday for an out of form, unfit RvP.

If it's not broken, don't try to fix it. After seeing LvG resist starting Di Maria yesterday, I am slightly more confident he will continue the same team. I remember a quote early in the season from LvG who says that he doesn't like to tinker once he has a set team; let's hope that this is his team.

3660~~~
Would get rid of him in the summer. Think of the wages we save with him and Falcao gone.

3661~~~
Totally forgot about this guy

3662~~~
With the midfield we have RVP will continue to struggle. Any striker would. we beat Liverpool today which makes all of us happy but letsface facts we hardly created any chance for our strikers.

3663~~~
I want to see RVP in this new 4-3-3. Maybe with Rooney in Fellaini's spot and DiMaria in for Young.

3664~~~
I'd leave it exactly as it is. He can come off the bench if needed but the current system works too fine to change anything. Why would he start anyways? He's been off form for almost the entire season so I doubt he will be on top form after his injury

3665~~~
We've seen that playing 2 immobile strikers does not work. 

This 433 is the best and most consistent we've looked all season, and you don't change a winning team. RVP can come wait it out on the bench until rooney stops playing well or scoring.

3666~~~
Yeah, let's just change a winning line up. Why don't we take Mata out too? Put Januzaj there.

3667~~~
Hope he goes in the summer. He was immense in his first season for us but you can't afford to be sentimental. This year he's been slow, boring, off-colour, and a hindrance going forward. Rooney has to stay up top on his own. If LVG changes this, after the best back-to-back results we've had since Fergie, I'll be very disappointed.

3668~~~
do not change a winning formulae

3669~~~
RvP getting injured was a lucky break for us. He was playing very badly, our tactics with two forwards were a mess and Van Gaal was unwilling to either drop him or change system. 

When he's fit again he should take Falcao's place on the bench and cover Rooney in case of injury or loss of form. I would be very disappointed to see Rooney pushed back into a deeper role or, worse, to see us change systems again when what we have right now makes the most sense and is clearly working.

3670~~~
I'd rather have Wilson in Falcao's cameo spots then RvP to be honest. But it's LvG, so he'll walk back into the squad.

3671~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> calm down, just a joke.

3672~~~
A fit and fresh RVP could give us an important and decisive edge in some of the tough games coming up. Teams like Arsenal, City and Everton have all had long seasons. I hope we can get to 3rd and avoid having to qualify. That just adds more pressure at the beginning of the new season

3673~~~
This. And I say that with no bad feeling toward RvP.

Even on a poor day (like against Liverpool), Rooney hassles defences and keepers, runs <i>endlessly</i> and most importantly - <b><i>presses tirelessly.</i></b>

Remember that moment where he almost pressed Mignolet into giving away the ball? Those 'little things' make a difference in the psychology of the opposition, he's like a guard dog IN FRONT of the midfield, and if we want to compete at the elite end of modern football we simply have to press from the front. RvP and Falcao offer utterly nothing in this regard and both should be off in the summer.

3674~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px"><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32176033" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Robin van Persie is not expected to be fit in time to feature in this month's Manchester derby, his manager Louis van Gaal has confirmed</a></span>

3675~~~
To be honest this is probably a good thing.

3676~~~
Some of you have such short memory's, yes he was not in form just before his injury but when he is getting good service he will usually put that ball in the back of the net, world class on his day and I look forward to him getting back to that way again.

3677~~~
So despite being poor for two out of three seasons here do you still see it happening? 

Rvp should absolutely not be starting for us, it would mean shoehorning Rooney into a position where he is blatantly not at his best and disrupting all the good work done recently, bench until the end of the season then sold.

3678~~~
He was poor last season? If you have those ridiculous standards than everyone at this club has been poor for the majority if his career, even Rooney..

3679~~~
Yes he was poor last season, although far from the only one his attitude and application were terrible last season, showed wenger like levels of hiding when things are tough.

3680~~~
He scored his goals when we had our worst season in 20 years time, actually having a better goalscoring record than the first whilst being plagued by injuries, your standard seem quite high if you classify that as poor.

3681~~~
Watched our last 3 games again and i think RVP would thrive in this current set up, Rooney's goals against Villa and Spurs were RVP-esque - forming something out of nothing, RVP did that a lot in his first season(can we rename it the RVP season? or #20?).

Granted, i haven't been his biggest fan this season and i have heavily criticised his performances, i still think he can get goals in this system, the real problem would be tampering with Team Chemistry by putting someone on the bench, RVP would do a lot for us outside the box, i think LVG should try him out as a second striker.

3682~~~
Declared himself fit

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/9795390/manchester-uniteds-robin-van-persie-fit-and-able-for-derby-at-old-trafford" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...persie-fit-and-able-for-derby-at-old-trafford</a>

3683~~~
I doubt he'll even feature on the bench vs City, but he's certainly a better option off the bench than Falcao once he gets match fit.

3684~~~
I don't think he'll play much football from now until the end of the season...until Herrera gets subbed off for no apparent reason

3685~~~
I'd rather he got "The 10 Minute Darren Fletcher Cameo(tm)" than Falcao...

3686~~~
I actually think he is going to be very good. He now knows he has to fight for his position, since it is not going to be handed to him. Also if he is set on a possible transfer he needs to be good to not rot away at some random club with some dough, he needs this. He'll be on fire, you heard it here first.

3687~~~
He can piss off and sit on the bench or in the stands.

3688~~~
Think this is bad news for Fellaini. I just feel that as soon as RVP is match fit, Van Gaal will want to put Rooney in the 10 role and RVP back up top. Think he sees Rooney as a waste up top, as his overall game is very good. That said, Van Gaal did recently say Fellaini was 'undroppable', so unless he has a couple of awful games, I can't see why he'd be dropped.

3689~~~
This.

3690~~~
How the mighty have fallen! 18 months ago he might have been the first name on the team sheet. Now we all dont want him to even start let alone be the first name on the team sheet.

3691~~~
you're fit to leave..

3692~~~
RVP -> striker
Rooney -> CM
Herrera -> bench

Simples.

3693~~~
great! now he can take falcao's spot on the bench, and falcao can return to the reserves.

our future has a lot more to do with wilson than it does with either falcao or RVP.

3694~~~
Would be unbelievably harsh on Fellaini and very strange by Van Gaal. Rooney's had his chance in midfield and it wasn't that great. 

I hope RVP takes over Falcao's 10 minute cameos from now on though. We should only play players who are actually going to be at the club next season.

3695~~~
I pity RVP if he thinks any United fan is actually happy at this news.

3696~~~
Hoping he can bounce back from the criticism he's taken. Personally am happy with the way we're currently playing and hope we stick with what we've currently got working well, but don't get some of the hate being fired towards him from some of our fans. Especially considering a good amount of his down form came at a time when the majority of the team were performing to absolute shit.

3697~~~
Agree, unfortunately that will happen as soon as RvP is fit to start games.

3698~~~
He's player who needs certain types of players around him. Its now got to the point where if the service is not perfect, he cannot improvise to make a half chance into a goal which for me only top strikers can do. His movement is so poor, lost some pace after the injury, and that predator instinct to hunt for space and gaps in defence seems to have vanished. Despite all that, I do believe when he gets an opportunity, he will finish it. I think in the next games alot of chances will be made by that Herrera, Mata and Valencia combination and if any of the strikers are clever, they can work on different routes of attacks and positions to be in when they are in the final third according to whoever's on the ball so that at the end of it, we finish these chances. Just practising loads of simulations so when matchday comes, you have an idea of where to be or where to go to when there on that right side of the pitch.  p.s sorry to go off topic, I'm just passionate today for some reason.

Who would make way to accommodate him in this set up ?

3700~~~
If he comes back into the starting XI at any point for the rest of the season, I'm going to lose my shit. 

Impact sub off the bench only, please.

3701~~~
I think he would be the perfect impact sub in this set up.

3702~~~
And people say Rooney is hated by his own fans. What vitriol all over this page.

3703~~~
This

Come on guys we've got a few big games coming up and to have Robin back at such an important stage of the season is fantastic .

Some of the comments are absurd saying he should sit in the stands and stuff ffs !!
He could become very important for us come the remaining games and i for one am glad he's back .
He will obviously start on the bench but called upon he can surely be a game changer for us . 
He's not been in the best of form pre injury but after watching from the sidelines he must be hitching to get involved , especially with our surge in form since he's been out .

3704~~~
a lot of the comments on here are a bit silly, classic fickle forum nonsense.

It's almost like people are forgetting VP in this in form team would do better than he did in that odd striker heavy off form team.

3705~~~
At what cost? We aren't going to drop Rooney, who is already doing more than enough upfront. So we'll unneccessarily drop him deeper, and unneccessarily drop one of Herrera/Fellaini.

3706~~~
Given the time he has been out, I wouldn't be surprised if LVG put him in the U21s before the first team - certainly if LVG stays consistent with what he has said and done in the past with the likes of Carrick.

I'm not going to add to the negativity here, but I don't want to see us change to starting with two strikers again - it didn't work when we tried to force it earlier in the season, but more than that the current formation has worked wonders. Please, please, please don't change it.

If RVP starts again this season, then it would have to be in Rooney's place. Otherwise it's the bench.

3707~~~
Would be genuinely gutted if Van Gaal responded to this by picking a different XI in the derby. Thankfully, I don't think he will.  

Good option to have on the bench though.

3708~~~
I have some doubt that he is fully fit. Just a hunch based on his lack of pace and agility prior to his last injury layoff. Think he should take his time and make certain everything is good.

3709~~~
Agree with this. Many, many things have changed since he was last playing. You would think that taking van Persie out was the only change if you went off some of the posts in here.

It is excellent news. I've said it before in other threads but I believe he is still our best striker, although I doubt he will even make the bench this weekend.

3710~~~
Some of the posts in the last couple of pages are really sad, RVP deserves better from the fans.

3711~~~
2 seasons a go you'd stick him straight in for Rooney, RVP was by far our best striker.  As we are today, the worst thing we could do is have Rooney in midfield, and as such RVP should start on the bench.  As others have said, I'd say he's a better bet than Falcao if needed to come on.

3712~~~
he would, so would Januzaj on the wing, Rafael at RB, Shaw at LB and they are much more match fit and performance eligible, almost anybody coming into team for anybody in this kind of form we are having would do good. Why would we wait for his form to show up? He was given freaking number of chances despite his league two performances.. He's lost his form 2 seasons ago. I assume it's not his form but standard he's playing at.

Sure he can find his scoring shoes at some point but still all the team needs to work for him. He can't score from half chance let alone his sitters this season he had, welbeck would have been crucified for that.. Players like Aguero, Kane or even Costa they can make chances by their own with their pace movement and dribbling, even Rooney tries, can drop deep make crossfield passes and he can press, which is really important. 

The striker is useless if he can't press defenders keeper high up the pitch, I don't want us to go back to the pub football we were practising when he was in the team let alone the stupidest ever system with two strikers to shoehorn him in the side... 

He's done even he hits the form at least I want palyers who play for the badge and give you 120% on the pitch. The duchtman doesn't look like giving a shite and most of the time spends in offside

3713~~~

3714~~~
But why should someone from this 'in form team' be dropped to accommodate him...?

And who do you drop?

3715~~~
Good news. Even in a poor season, he has produced goals and assists. Van Gaal isn't going to put him straight in. Van Persie will play a bench role - what a fantastic option for us to have.

3716~~~
He'll be a good option to have on the bench. Really can't see Van Gaal dropping anyone for van Persie that would be madness.

3717~~~
Can't see it to be honest, LVG isn't stupid and he is surely well aware of the contribution Herrera has made over the last few games.  Don't think he will try and shoehorn RVP straight back in when it's clear we have found the balance he is looking for.  He didn't put Di Maria straight into the team after Spurs either.  I reckon RVP will be used as an impact sub instead of Falcao and honestly I'd much rather see him come on if we need a goal.

3718~~~
If we had to play him, I'd maybe even try Rooney wide left where Young is now and RvP up front. Obviously I'd rather LVG just picked one and be done with it.

3719~~~
Hodgson tried something similar at the World Cup with a random effects if I remember correctly.

3720~~~
Oh yes. I tried erasing that WC from my memory.

3721~~~
Rather he than Falcao on the bench. Other than that, meh.

3722~~~
I don't see why there has to be a cost. RvP can take Falcao's spot on the sub bench and when the time is right and Fellaini needs to come off then RvP can come on in the striker role as Falcao has these past few games while Rooney falls back into ACM and Di Maria replaces Young. 

Same system as the past few games and no cost.

3723~~~
Good to have him back but he shouldn't be anywhere near the starting line-up. Time for him to prove himself again.

3724~~~
He never looked right since the World Cup. I think with the right recovery time he'll be back to his best. Class is permanent.

Talk of him leaving in the summer is absolute nonsense in my opinion.

3725~~~
It would be so frustrating if Fellaini or Herrera were benched for RvP to be shoehorned in. The last few games we have played our best football of the season, we finally have a team with all the pieces in the correct place, if LvG upsets that consistency to play RvP I'd really question him as the right guy going forward, it would be such poor management both on a team level and man management level for whoever was dropped to accommodate an out of form, frankly past it looking striker.

3726~~~
It's got nothing to do with form and everything to do with the fact he's looked disinterested, lazy and legless in almost every appearance this season. The lone #9 role require tireless workrate and the ability to run the channels and open up space, RvP doesn't have the ability to do that role now IMO.

3727~~~
Agree, it makes me nervous - both in the City and Chelsea games.

3728~~~
The thing is that he should normally play with the reserve team before coming back with the first team no ? Van Gaal made an exception for Carrick because he's vital to our balance, but this season, RVP is not vital, and we can even question whether he will be a better sub than Falcao... 

I think that, and I hope, that LVG will stick with his formation, and keep Rooney upfront, then RVP will have to compete with Falcao for a place on the bench

3729~~~
Zlatan plays upfront on his won for PSG and I wouldn't say tireless workrate, or ability to run the channels and open up space describes him...

Van Persie would score in this flowing confident team.

3730~~~
I wouldn't question this to be fair. He almost certainly will be.

3731~~~
It wouldn't be a flowing confident team anymore if RvP waltzed right back into the team and pushed Rooney further. And in games like City and Chelsea, Fellaini is more needed presence than RvP and his passenger acts.

3732~~~
Didn't the "passenger" score the late equaliser against Chelsea earlier this season?

3733~~~
All right then. That makes it reason enough to disrupt the one system that has worked well to fit in a past it and a rubbish RvP of this season into the team. Lets push Rooney back into midfield while we're at it and have the ever static and lazy RvP up front again. For the first time all season, since RvP has been out and Falcao hasn't played, we've looked like a proper team. We can't continue to play two strikers upfront. It's not good for the balance. Rooney is the better finisher of the two as well so it's quite easy really. RvP doesn't deserve to be anywhere near the first xi.

3734~~~
Last season too. I assumed Van Gaal would have him back to his best, now Moyes is gone. I assumed wrong. Looks as though the issue goes deeper than disenchantment with the manager.

3735~~~
Yeah, that won't happen. Permanently, at least. He is no longer good enough to start for this side.

3736~~~
I remember reading a stat somewhere, earlier this season (probably before Christmas), that van Persie had covered more ground than any other United player. I think it was for set of games, as well. I think he was a victim, as with most of our players, of playing in the wrong set up in a very dysfunctional team. I believe he still has a lot to offer, and with our tough fixture list, me may need his services, in the next few weeks. One thing for sure is, he won't be starting against City and we won't be shoehorning him in; look at the way in which van Gaal has relegated Falcao and di Maria to bench. I'm actually quite curious to see how he'd fare up front, on his own, maybe against Palace or West Brom (depending on results); personally, I don't think Rooney's been that impressive over the last few games and, if he continues his inconsistent/poor form against City and Chelsea, we might see a change.

3737~~~
Ibra actually picks up a lot of positions for PSG, he drops deep and floats wide within the game, plus he's still a big strong unit that is hard to handle, RvP looks physically weak and sluggish.

Yeah, I think it's simply a case of him hitting a physical dip sooner than a lot of players do these days, not unlike Shevchenko.

3738~~~
Zlatan is a freakishly intelligent player, he only runs in the right channel. One second he is walking and looking totally disinterested and the next second he is exactly where you want him to be. He can also come late and just flatten the CBs, Ibrahimovic is a different beast.

Edit: And I'm sure that he is a lot faster than he seems, he closes the distance very fast.

3739~~~
No, they're playing quite well because 
Not everything that comes before the other is the cause of the other. 

Rooney wasn't playing particularly well lately, and the goals he scored were mainly typical midfielders goals, or he was even playing as a midfielder the moment he scored.  But Van Persie will get 20/30 minutes first, and then he can prove that he benefits most from the newfound patterns and decisiveness. Rooney will prove both Van Gaal and Ferguson were right in playing him behind a striker.

3740~~~
They are playing well for the reason I said, because everyone is in their correct place and the team is full of energy and in sync, the last thing we need to do is add a past his best striker into the mix with 7 vital games left. Herrera or Fellaini being dropped and Rooney shoved back into midfield would be crazy, he gives us a constantly moving target as the #9 and both Herrera and Fellaini have benefited with goals due to Rooney's movement and tireless workrate in the lone striker role, adding RvP would kill all of that and put focus back on trying to build our play around feeding a has been striker.

3741~~~
How many games can people think of where RvP and Rooney have played well together and looked like an effective partnership?

Getting the best out of one seems to have come at the expensive of the other so far.

3742~~~
this, he should get place on the bench before Falcao though....

3743~~~
This x 100.

I hate to sound all dogmatic and objective, but anyone suggesting that Rooney should move back into midfield, or that we should change formation right now knows very little about football.

3744~~~
I should have finished that sentence, sorry about that. I think it's the in sync part that makes the difference. Finally everybody has stopped chasing towards the ball all the time, everybody knows their position, where to pass and where to move, and know it immediately so the ball can move around quickly. That releases the energy and makes it difficult for a place to be incorrect for a player. Even Mata on the wing is no problem, although he lacks pace and doesn't run at defenders. Without beeing in sync, this formation would have been a disaster a couple of months ago. 

Of course, Van Gaal has to be careful not to make too much changes at once, because it could disrupt the in sync part. But this formation as it is right now is far from ideal.

3745~~~
He will make the bench v City and possibly replace Rooney later in the game as per Van Gaal's 'filosophee' of not rushing recently injured players back.

3746~~~
I think I've missed your point, why is it far from ideal? Looks pretty good from where I'm standing, we're playing probably the best football we've played for what ....3 years?

3747~~~
Its actually very close to ideal in that he has finally put the appropriate pieces to the puzzle together, and they all fit.

3748~~~
If by <i>"far from ideal"</i>, you mean "incredibly close to ideal", then yes...

3749~~~
I think we absolutely must play the eleven that are winning and doing so with the kind of performances we want to see from a United team, we have 7 cup finals as Mata said, no need to tinker.

The formation is so well balanced that I don't see how it's far from ideal, sure we could do with upgrades on Fellaini and Young within the formation if we are to challenge for the PL next season, but the actual base of how LvG likes to play is there, and one of the vital aspects is Rooney up top, his movement and workrate there allows our triangles on the left and right to function so well as he pulls defenders out of position and we exploit that with the midfield runs between the fullbacks and CB's, RvP is much too slow and lacking in workrate for that and he'd hurt our overall attack as we are relying on Fellaini and Herrera to chip in as we don't get a lot of goals from the wide forwards.

3750~~~
Because ideally, you have speed at both wings, from players who run at defenders, ideally in midfield you have players with quicker feet and better passing than Fellaine, and ideally Rooney scores a lot of goals from behind the striker so he gets near and into the box instead of already standing there to recieve the ball. 

Yes it looks pretty good, but that's because everybody knows where to be, where to move and where to pass in almost any given situation. A lot of training went into that, but finally they all know. That's important, but if players from the bench also know, changing a player for another good player wouldn't make much difference. 

You think Mata on the wing is a natural fit? I think he's succesfully shoehorned in, it works well because he's a good player who understands his position and the movement around him, but it's about the movement and passing throughout the team that makes it work, the in sync part, not the perfect fit.

3751~~~
On the first paragraph, isn't that what an ideal formation is supposed to be like? They're winning, they're playing exciting footall and they know where to find eachother.

On the second, perhaps Mata is doing so well there because yes, he is a very gifted player and understands movement, but also that since he understads the position so well it might suit him very well?

I wouldn't say doing so well in a position is shoehorning.

3752~~~
It doesn't matter whether a player is a 'natural fit' - what matters is whether the team are playing well with certain players in the lineup and the positions they have been asked to play in. When you focus less on individuals and more on the collective performance of the team, things suddenly become more logical.

3753~~~
Oh I'd start him from the bench, and only bring him in if there is a need.
Just saying some of the comments are ridiculous, and classic of the "Hero" or "Villain" with nothing in between mentality of many fans

3754~~~
Fair play, I agree with that.

3755~~~
No need to tinker right now given we are doing so well but I don't see any issues with RVP replacing Fellaini and Rooney dropping back to a more #10-ish role. Sounds good to me.

3756~~~
If we take the treble winning side from 2017 as the ideal, it's not that close either. But I admit 'far from ideal' was not the right choice of words, too strong.

It's not that RVP doesn't understand the concept of triangles. I'm interested to see what RVP could do with this new style coming together finally. I don't think Rooney up top is vital, the vital change has been moving to one angle of the triangle immediately instead of moving towards the ball instinctively. Imo Rooney can be most important as a 20 goal a season, hard working, well moving midfielder, just behind the striker and getting a lot of balls to run at from that striker. For me, the fact that he can score a lot of goals and the manner in which he tends to score goals is a reason not to put him up top. He's too good at lots of other stuff than finishing and he's not particularly good at typical finishers goals. He scores his goals from positions a midfielder could and should get into. 

That they know where to find eachother is not a matter of formation but the result of very intense training for about 8 months now.

No, imo for an ideal player there of course is the understanding of the position, but also a certain specific strengths, like speed and the ability to run at defenders. That's the difference between ideal and doing very well.

I'm not the one pleading for Rooney up top so he can score more goals. My focus is on the collective performance, and with a real striker in front of him, Rooney can still score 20 a season, and the striker even more. It's because I focus on the collective performance, I see the collective change over the last couple of months. That's the change in movement and understanding of eachothers movement. The opinion that RVP out has made the difference is focussed on the individual.

3757~~~
Give him the right pass and he's capable of producing match winners, stick him on the bench

3758~~~
It's not that RvP doesn't understand the triangles it's that he's too slow to provide the movement to execute their purpose within the attack, also Rooney might be able to score from deep but his short passing game is not suited to playing as a CM. Rooney up top is vital just as Benzema and Costa are vital to their teams, high pressing, tireless workrate and plenty of movement. Are you really suggesting we should start next season with RvP as the #9 and Rooney in midfield?

3759~~~
You're mental.

3760~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

3761~~~
I think he would be an entrance against city if we were behind in the 80th min for Herrera, Rooney dropping to midfield.

3762~~~
What's wrong with his short passing game?

Those are completely different kind of players, much more alike RVP than Rooney.
Is it really that strange? I thought Ferguson bought RVP to play in front of Rooney.

We're only 8 months into an ambitious 3 year rebuild, the team is finally doing well now, especially considering the fact that a lot of the fit and in form players are not particularly suited to the style of play. That's gonna change the upcoming transfer windows I presume and the starting line up in would be much closer to ideal and quite different from the current one.

3763~~~
It's not very good, certainly not for the way LvG likes the midfield to play.

No they aren't, RvP has nowhere near the physical attributes or work ethic of Rooney, Benzema and Costa, he's a luxury striker. 

Yes it is strange, Fergie had it in for Rooney after the first contract stand-off, he bought RvP and prioritized him as the #9 and started a second rift with Rooney. It's also strange because Rooney is not a CM and RvP will be 32 at the start of next season and is past his best by some way. Doing what you're suggesting would take us backwards not forwards. The only thing we should be doing regarding RvP is seeing which of the Italian and Turkish clubs are going to offer the most for him in the summer.

3764~~~
He hasn't shifted his arse for the right pass all season long.

3765~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What's he done to you?

3766~~~
His finishing has also been rather suspect at times this season. The amount of times Di Maria played those dinked through balls for him at the start of the year for him to ruin was rather jarring.  It's not simply a case of, 'put him in, he'll do damage'.

3767~~~
I would only be happy to see RVP in a Falcao type role, ie. bring him on, when you dont need to score.
We need to win games, so keep playing Rooney up front, as the lone striker.
The main issue is that RVP is slow - his technique is exquisite though.
I think he needs to be sold in the Summer, though.

3768~~~
Nothing...Just don't want him starting against City <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3769~~~
Then he is in trouble because his requirements for the short passing game aren't much different for a centre forward of his kind.

I agree his skills and technique are more refined than Rooney's, Benzema's and Costa's.
That must have been a very long term rift then, because he hardly ever played Rooney up top in all those years.

If RvP is past it another centre forward should be bought. If he's not good enough anymore that doesn't mean Rooney is good enough for that position in a United that is challenging for title's and cups. In 4-4-2 Rooney is the natural second striker, not the most forward one, in 4-3-3 that equals to CM.

3770~~~
Few rumours of him in talks with Fenerbache to link up with national teammates Sneijder and Kuyt.

3771~~~
Sneijder is at Galatassaray

3772~~~
And Kuyt retired from International football, so they are not technically teammates anymore. Also, he's rumoured to go back to Feyenoord at the end of the season.

3773~~~
Well at least we have finally hit the crux of all this, I thought you were just a big RvP fan but now it's clear you just don't want Rooney as the #9, yet the season after Ronnie left he played as the #9 and bagged one of the best totals in PL history, he's exactly where he should be right now, not taking up a spot in midfield.

3774~~~
Keep him as a rotational option. Wilson, RvP and Rooney is enough competition for the lone striker position. I don't think he's finished, his touch has still been great this season, given a rest in the summer and less of a starting role next season and I think he'll regain a lot of sharpness too.

3775~~~
I think RVP is a very good player who has been slightly better than Rooney has ever been, but if he keeps going from injury tot injury, with inconsistent performances inbetween, the end is near. I get the feeling you don't like RvP very much and don't want to give the tiniest bit of credit. 

But that's personal, I certainly do like Rooney. But I don't need him to be topscorer to know he's good. I get the feeling most people who prefer Rooney up top see the nr 9 as better than the nr 10 position, like it's a demotion to be moved to midfield. I don't agree at all, I think in general the nr 10 is the more important position and the more influential player in attacking possession based 4-3-3 and I'm sure Van Gaal does to. It's Rooney's best position, what he lacks in refinement he compensates with energy, versatility and vision.

3776~~~
I echoed this again recently in another thread and just had a look at his most recent games and it really does back it up. 

Against Burnley he played 3 forward passes in the final third (0 into the area), the rest of his 25 successful passes were either backwards or square and wide. He didn't recieve a single pass within 30 yards of goal. 

Against West Ham he played 1 forward pass into the area, the rest of his 20 passes were miles from the box, he received 3 passes in the area. 


I really think that a large part of our success recently has been having a striker who doesn't just constantly drop into no mans land to recieve the ball. Rooney gets in behind and gets into dangerous areas in a way that Van Persie just doesn't have the mobility to any more.

3777~~~
I feel that RvP is now a pure poacher. He doesn't really build up unless it's laying it off to the flanks while he joins the attack. Which is why he is so ineffective if he doesn't get the ball in the box at all. Which was the main problem with this team in the middle third of this season. Lack of penetration means RvP hardly touched the ball in the box. He was starved of service. IINM, I remember reading stats that we hardly got the ball into danger areas at that time, despite all our possession.

It would truly be interesting to see with the amount of penetration we are getting now, whether RvP would thrive. He would surely get much more service than he did before. Having said that, I would still prefer LvG to maintain the same first 11, at least until a need for changes arises. We can't afford mistakes at this critical juncture.

3778~~~
If Messi ever played in a 442 he too woudl be the second striker but in a 433, as we all know, he's best upfront (false 9) if not out wide, but definitely not as CM.
I'm sorry but the second striker and CM skillset is vastly different. Rooney isn't even a #10 like Zidane or Silva who play it short, build up moves and then go for the killer pass or dribble. Rooney's party piece is the long diagonal, the run into the box, and the explosive shot. His control is average and he gets caught in possession, he isn't the most reliable short passer either. At 28ish I don't think he has yet mastered the decision-making in picking the correct pass at the correct time. Also, he can mark one particular player but I haven't seen him do well at collectively pressing or collectively dropping back or defending as part of a unit- all of which CMs need.

3779~~~
If LVG shoehorns him straight back into the starting 11 I'll be very disappointed in him, considering how far we've come. Obviously RVP isn't Andy Carroll, but I think Rooney should be staying up front.

3780~~~
We have people here saying he hasn't moved for passes this season and others saying he's missed countless sitters. It can't be both so which is it?

3781~~~
<a class="username" data-user="88815, @Dr. Funkenstein" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/88815/">@Dr. Funkenstein</a> i agree with a lot of what you are saying.

It's worth noting that Rooney's goal against Villa came after he was pushed back into the 'Fellaini role' - which matches with your claim that he scores goals from midfielder positions. Prior to that he was arguably our worst player on the pitch for the second game running.

I believe, along with you, that our improvement had been largely down to LVG's training, and not simply shifting Rooney up top or having RVP nowhere near the team. I have seen nothing from Rooney the last few weeks that makes me believe RVP couldn't do a better job up top.

3782~~~
It is possible to do both, you know. It's not like the two are mutually exclusive. Even the most lethargic of strikers get chances.

3783~~~
Ocassionally. To read on here you'd think he'd been sat on his arse in front of goal all season missing countless chances per game. As it is he's got 10 goals in 25 games. Not what you expect from Robin Van Persie but in a team playing as poorly as we were it doesn't make him fit for the knackers yard just yet either.

Come on, be fair. He wasn't the only one passing backward. Have you forgotten how sh*t we were just a few weeks ago; we only just learnt to pass forward against Spurs. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DdJYwn4vwaA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Skip to 5.50 in that video, and look at what Rooney does.

3785~~~
Those stats don't mean much seeing as most of those passes would have been with his back to goal and holding the ball up. That one forward pass against WHU was a delightful through ball to Falcao (And he predictably fecked it up). RVP ran in behind the defense on plenty of occasions at the start of the season, probably even more than Rooney. It was his finishing that let him down rather than his movement, which is generally excellent.


I tend to agree with <a class="username" data-user="88815, @Dr. Funkenstein" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/88815/">@Dr. Funkenstein</a> . Rooney is at his best when he's slightly withdrawn. It gets the best out of him and the team while still allowing him to use his creativity and goal scoring instincts. I don't see how Rooney dropping deeper into the Fellaini role and RVP up top is a bad thing.

3786~~~
I don't agree. If you play 4-3-3 with the midfield pointing forward, CM is the position closest to the false nine. Actually, both the man up front and the CM are a bit false in different ways. Ideally the 9 in a strong and static way, and the 10 in a dynamic agile way. Messi would be at his best with a strong centre forward, tall and therefore a big reach, who does a lot of one touch lay offs, and who can turn towards goal with a defender on his back, a bridgehead at the edge of the box. That must be why Guardiola got Ibrahimovic, but overlooked the two weak points of Ibrahimovic: with the ball kept on the grass, his first touch isn't solid nor very precise, and by personality he's not servient. I get the feeling Messi is played as a striker because of his personal goal scoring statistics, which are not only good for his ego, but also very important for his marketing and therefore the money. But he does all right as a striker <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

When playing CM, his long diagonal could be very useful on the break, and for the run into the box he needs be outside the box first. 

I think there's an important role for Van Gaal there, especially the timing, getting in sync collectively. I think it's quite an intelligent player, but I agree he's not the ideal 10. But I do think that most people here don't realize how close a CM in Van Gaal's possesson based attacking 4-3-3 can be to a second striker. Bergkamp has played CM, Litmanen did, Kluivert did (occasionally).

Not only when he's playing from midfield, also the kind of the goals he scored as the striker were from positions a CM could or should get into. The man up front often ends up at near or far post, or close to the goalkeeper, has to move away to the side of the box, ends up with tight angles, has little space to run and often has to pass his man from a standing start, not really situations Rooney is very good at. 

Yes, but RVP has also had a few games this season where he didn't do much at all, while Rooney always makes something happen in one way or another, even if he's very poor. So it depends on RVP's form more than Rooney's, but I don't doubt that in a few weeks he will get as much in sync as Rooney.

3787~~~
I have nothing against RvP, I just think he's shot physically and I want a quick, strong and hard working #9, not a luxury player who has the odd silky moment but slows down the team in general and has no pace.

Again not the case, I love a good #10, I just don't think Rooney is a good #10. Could he play as a CM who scores goals like Lampard? Yeah probably, but I'd rather have a CM in there that has a great range of passing and skill and leave Rooney up top to harrass CB's and get goals, the things he is best at.

3788~~~
Rather have him off the bench than Falcao.

Obviously we shouldn't change a winning formula with this current starting eleven.

3789~~~
So now he's out?

3790~~~
I think RVP is going to surprise a few people when he gets back. 

I would start him on the bench obviously but if he takes his chance I could see him playing himself back into the team.

I have voiced my concern about this before though. I like Rooney up front and I like one up front. So if Rooney is undroppable, we have very little flexibility. 

Id like to see Rooney and RVP slug it out for that position. But I guess, if RVP plays well enough to deserve a start, Ill have to content myself with Rooney dropping back into Fellaini's position. Which I am not that keen on. 

But as I said, in terms of RVP's form alone and putting the headache it will cause to one side, I think he still has plenty to offer. I cant believe people are writing him off already. A year ago I thought everyone was OTT thinking he was so far ahead of Rooney and we would never have won the league the year before without him. Now its swung too far the other way.

3791~~~
I am not sure if this has been posted already. It's a very interesting GIF by the guys from Statsbomb  comparing the stats from RvP at Arsenal through his career with us. It gives a nice insight how he has changed (less passing but better percentage etc)

3792~~~
This thread kind of shows how most posters on here don't really think critically when it comes to football. Opinion comes purely from confirmation bias and coincidences. Posters attribute Utds rise in form to Van Persies absence and Rooney's inclusion in the no.9 position yet how does that explain Utds improved midfield performances, passing, team cohesion, defending? How come the team put in one of its best performances this season against Liverpool away when Rooney put in one of his worse displays ever for the club as a striker? Rooney hasn't been particularly great. He's scoring some great goals but he is not putting in amazing performances. Its pretty obvious that Van Gaal has finally gotten the team playing the way he wants them to play and thats a result of hours and hours of hardwork and repetition of his methods on the training field not because Van Persie simply picked up an injury. Thats basically a huge slap on the face to Van Gaal. People also think that Van Gaal would sacrifice his teams performances simply because he's "mates" with Van Persie. Do you really know who Van Gaal is?

3793~~~
It's easy to explain how the injury to RvP helped us.

Firstly it created space for Rooney upfront. His midfield performances were poor and he is far more useful to us as a forward. His pace and energy were sorely lacking from RvP and Falcao. He is making more and better runs giving our creative players good passing options and creating space for other attackers. A fair number of our recent goals are ones we simply wouldn't have scored without him upfront, neither of RvP or Falcao can run out defenders like he did against Tottenham or press them as against Newcastle and Villa. He brings these qualities in every game, regardless of how good his touch is or if he is shooting well.

In turn this allowed Herrera to get in the team. For my money he's our best midfielder but he wasn't even getting a chance with Rooney having 'privileges' and starting every game in midfield. His energy is excellent and, as with Rooney moving upfront, is another reason for our much improved pressing. His link-up play is also great, especially with Mata and of course he scores goals.

There are other benefits too. The change in formation to 4-3-3 has been huge for us and there was no indication of that happening until after RvP got injured. It was a big blunder of Van Gaal to spend so much of the season insisting on two immobile forwards but not playing wingers to supply them with chances. Now we've got a more mobile player upfront and threats from wide areas too. Mata's performance at Anfield was maybe the best any of our attackers have put in all season and he was playing in a position which we have spent most of the season trying to avoid using.

3794~~~
The above post has covered it well, but put bluntly, we don't have to shove square pegs in round holes with no RvP in the side. Adding him has a chain reaction on many other positions. To our detriment at that.

3795~~~
The reason we have played better in midfield is because we are playing midfielders in midfield rather than playing strikers there.

3796~~~
Because we have an extra midfielder in midfield (who isn't Rooney).

Because we're pressing hard from the front via Rooney - who did a great job of doing that at Liverpool and closed them down from the front every chance he got. Something RvP just can't do.

Yeah, he is. Take Rooney out of that false 9 slot and the pressure on the midfield will increase, and in turn the pressure on the defence will increase.[/QUOTE]

True. However, it's also true that it took RvP being injured, Di Maria being suspended, Falcao being dropped - Rooney moved from CM to CF and Ander Herrera and Juan Mata being moved from the bench to the starting line up for it to work...

3797~~~
Daily Mail for the past week or so keeps reporting he's out this summer.  Even going as far to predict that we will pay him to leave so he can be offered to Serie A at a cut price (right up Juventus' ally).  
I think it's inevitable we are bringing in another striker and I think it will be Cavani.  That rumor hasn't gone away for about a year now.

3798~~~
I really hope not.

3799~~~
And next season will become this season part 2 - how to fit in your striker captain and your big name, unproven PL striker...

3800~~~
Cavani can play on the wings too. Maybe Van Gaal is looking to kill two birds with one stone. 

Rooney up top, Cavani on the wings. Rooney in the 10, Cavani up top.

3801~~~
He's not a winger though, and hasn't excelled out wide.

It's a signing that would make no sense to me from any point of view other than a marketing one...

3802~~~
Cavani can 'play on the wings' the same Wayne Rooney can play in midfield.

3803~~~
Van Persie used to play on the wing aswell. At the national team, we had Huntelaar (one of our better players) on the bench because van Gaal doesn't like strikers on the wing. He rather shoves Rooney in midfield than use Cavani as winger.

3804~~~
The Telegraph as him joining Inter Milan .What ever the rumour it is looking more than likely that RVP will leave this Summer.

3805~~~
two things- his injury was a blessing in disguise.
second- he didn't look happy yesterday.

3806~~~
This. When the camera shot to him, he looked as if we were losing 6-0. I love the guy for what he did for us a couple of seasons ago, but I think it's time for him to leave now. Fantastic player, but isn't really suited for us now. Unless he's happy to play from the bench and occassionaly rotate with Rooney, then I think it's best for him to prolong his career elsewhere - and I really hope it's not Inter Milan. Still think he could do a job in the CL.

3807~~~
Fine, as long as people aren't going to bitch when he gets his rotational starts - that means either resting Rooney or having Rooney somewhere in midfield. 

Personally, if it's that sort of role I'd rather have a younger developing striker for that role.

3808~~~
Anyone has a gif or sthing of him not being happy. Didnt notice that one.

3809~~~
It's a non issue..really.

3810~~~
Don’t think he’s leaving. He’s like the perfect player to be a back-up for Rooney in current setup, and we need another experienced striker. I’m sure he will understand that he doesn’t have the legs to be a starter week-in week-out.

Only way I see him leaving is if he wants to move. But I don’t think that’s the case.

3811~~~
We're going to have an additional 10-12 games next season, and he'd thrive in the current set up. We should keep him for another year at least. Rooney won't be able to play every game.

3812~~~
The main issue I had for the first half of the season, was trying to accommodate two strikers, which messed up the balance of the team. It's looking like we've settled on a 433 now (surprised it took Van Gaal so long to do that) and I think RvP would do well in the position Rooney is playing. 
Main issue is whether he'd want to stay as a sub, because I wouldn't want to force Rooney deeper again.

3813~~~
I think we will need his 10 goals next season, we need to sign 1 more striker though, the teams that usually win the league tend to have 3+ strikers in their teams and there is usually 1 veteran striker amongst them and another who can play multiple positions (RVP,Rooney).

3814~~~
I'm grateful for his services which won us a 20th title, but he's been below-par ever since and I personally wouldn't mind if he quietly left. I don't think that he has the hunger to be part of this side.

3815~~~
Well we have Wilson in that vein too, so a veteran and a rookie would be our two back ups. While I don't really care if RvP leaves and we get a replacement, we badly need new signings in other areas and I'd like to refrain from a massive overhaul as much as possible.

3816~~~
Let him go to a smallest club like Inter

3817~~~
There's nothing more annoying that judging a person's emotional state based on 3 seconds of camera time. As if anyone walks around with a huge smile on their face 24/7.

Camera snaps a player inwardly contemplating the merits of rice vs risotto for dinner that night? Said player is obviously unhappy and wants out.

3818~~~
Use him as the latest player to sweeten the pot for a Pogba return (Nani and Hernandez being the others). In fact, removing those three players from our wages would allow for each of Pogba, Hummels, and Depay's wages.

3819~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3820~~~
...because part-exchange deals always happen in real life, and not just on the back pages of the Daily Star...

3821~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's a good point, but it was still a correct observation that he looked as if he had just drunk a liter of off milk. Maybe he's bored to be fair, being out for so long and seeing the team do well while he's away.

3822~~~
But they could if genuinely pursued, as well as the fact that each of those player would add value to Juve.

3823~~~
Van Persie in Fergusons last ever game at old trafford. I would trade any player in our squad right now to get a peak Van Persie back. So good.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XJi6gVGqUl4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3824~~~
Don't write him off too early. Can easily get you 10-15 goals. Is already at 10 with some injuries.

I wouldnt sign Falcao or Cavani. Sign a younger potential Rooney replacement with a view in maybe 3 years time. I'd go in the season with 4 Strickers (maybe a loan for Wilson)

Rooney
RVP
Sign Future Rooney replacement 
Wilson on loan

3825~~~
According to Eurosport we offer him 7 million euros to leave the club in the summer <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
They are talking about a loyality clause, where we have to pay him 14 million euros if he stays till his contract is out. Anyone knows something about that, sounds like media bullshit for me. I also think we should keep him, get rid of Falcao, add Depay and maybe another young striker/wide attacker (but we can sign that player also 2016 when van Persies contract is out) and Rooney, van Persie, Wilson should be enough. He can still be a good joker and win us some points with his goals, he just shouldn't be a starter anymore.

3826~~~
I'm not sure if anyone else has mentioned this, but having seen Nev's analysis of Rooney, I'd be very intrigued to watch again, some of RVPs performances earlier this season. Yes, he can slow it down when he actually gets on the ball, but when people were calling him lazy etc, was he just doing what Rooney was doing on Sunday? Occupying the defenders? It's not that far fetched, given that he knows Van Gaal's system so well, that he has been completely executing the role Louis wants from his forwards all season. So while us fans who don't know exactly what Louis wants are lamenting the death of RVP, perhaps Louis sees something completely differently, and playing him repeatedly wasn't mere bias?

3827~~~
An absolutely moronic non story. He was indeed that unhappy that he even brought his wife to the game. And I swear <a class="username" data-user="57313, @Hernandez - BFA" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/57313/">@Hernandez - BFA</a> must be a body language expert by profession. I clearly remember him writing a novel about Di Maria not looking happy only a few weeks ago, too.

3828~~~
Jesus, all I said was that the camera caught him looking glum. Not once did I say "Looks sad = he wants to leave".

3829~~~
100% yes. Even when we were playing the 352 he understood his role perfectly - out of possession the two strikers split out wide, the #10 pushed up in between them and they became a three man first line of defence with van Persie defending the right wing. On the ball he was then occupying that space in the inside right as the target man and throughout the season whenever he played he was always the focal point of attack with Rooney and Falcao running off him. He got criticised for his lack of touches but now Neville's managed to turn that into a positive for Rooney, and recognised that it was a requirement of the role and is entirely dependent on the midfielders' use of the ball and nothing to do with his "desire to get on the ball", perhaps some people will look at it in a different light.

Neville's already did some of the work for you:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ewFBzMk-w3Y?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3830~~~
You said he was looking as if we were losing 6-0 which is just ridiculous.

3831~~~
Which was an exaggeration....I'm sorry if that didn't come across more obvious.

3832~~~
No prob and no need to say sorry to me, I am not RvP!

3833~~~
The celebration <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<a class="externalLink" href="https://instagram.com/p/1dbcy5Q-iI/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://instagram.com/p/1dbcy5Q-iI/</a>

3834~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3835~~~
There were plenty of times when he wasn't though, and Van Gaal said as much how he was out of form and probably would've been dropped at various times had it not been for injuries to others... Before his injury though he was definitely playing a lot better and Van Gaal was saying how he was getting back to his best.

On the other hand he did tend to play with another striker, and neither were working properly. He was playing the role of a lone striker in a two man set up, which is completely different. Part of the problem was how he wasn't making enough off the ball runs or dragging the defenders around, which was on him since we didn't have wide players to do that.

3836~~~
That's a lie. Van Persie is literally always making runs. Anyone who doesn't have an agenda against RvP will tell you that.

3837~~~
Fans are really fickle

3838~~~
I doubt he will be sold to be frank. More likely, he will stay with us for another season, see his contract out and then get all the bonuses and sign for another club. May well depend on what happens to Chicha, Henriquez and Wilson. I think The latter three will get their chances before their faith is sealed.

3839~~~
Even in Rooney's masterclass performance against City, he wasn't making many runs, it was more to do with the positions he was taking up and how he kept hassling their center backs.

3840~~~
Forgot about him thought he had been loaned with a deal in place for a permanent switch?

3841~~~
Starts for the reserves tonight. Hopefully he'll be fit soon and thus no more Falcao.

3842~~~
His game has never really relied on pace, I can't quite understand why he's not as good as he used to be.

3843~~~
If it was <i>just </i>his pace then, in theory anyway, he shouldn't be effected as much as he has been. It looks like more then that though.

3844~~~
He is van Gaal his perfect idea of a striker, he can hold up the ball to bring others into play and he can finish. I'm sure van Persie will still get a chance in 433 before van Gaal makes his decision on him, his pace is gone but he might still be able to deliver for us. Especially since he knows van Gaal's idea how to play like a striker. He might thrive now the rest of the team also know what to do.

3845~~~
if you look at highlights from RVP's first season here it looks like he's lost a a yard or two. there's no question he was a lot faster than he was, and considering he was never fast to begin with, any drop is going to be noticeable.

3846~~~
Thats been my biggest concern with him this season tbh. All players lose their pace eventually, but his clear lack of physicality this season has been worrying. His hold up play (bar that one away game against Southampton) has been so poor compared to the 'old' RVP.

I posed an article a few months ago where RVP was talking about how he'd put on a lot of muscle around the period he had his best form for Arsenal, and then United, and how it had really helped him. But he's looking leaner then ever these days, and definitely looks like he's lost all that muscle gain.

3847~~~
I fear this too and have a sneak feeling van Gaal does too. He hasn't played since we've started ticking though, I very much doubt van Gaal will freeze him out for the rest of the season. He deserves a chance up front on his own, I don't think van Gaal has decided on him yet because of this.

In theory he should be good enough for another season, but he will have to show promise in the last few matches of the season.

3848~~~
Was he any good for the reserves tonight?

3849~~~
Not really.

3850~~~
Did that Liverpool moneyball chap not say that their studies show that the vast majority of strikers over 30 go into sharp decline in The Premier League? Comoli is it?

3851~~~
Exceptions to every rule. Wasn't Drogba still banging them in past 30? Not to mention good old (literally) Teddy Sheringham. 

Mind you, Van Persie's been playing like someone pushing 40.

3852~~~
There are exceptions of course, but in moneyball you follow the rule and not your nose I guess. Van Persie does look old though, I agree, that is why I thought of it.

3853~~~
I expect the newspapers to be telling us how LVG has humiliated him tonight <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3854~~~
Think when you've had as many injuries as he's had throughout his career, he'll decline a lot sooner (as we've seen) then normal. Players who stay fit and don't have too many injury problems tend to stay at the highest level for longer.

3855~~~
I actually thought the opposite might be true. Because he'd played relatively few games his body might be "younger" than someone who played a lot more football over the years. Looking more and more like I was dead wrong.

3856~~~
His hold up play is still exceptional. What's slightly annoying is that he seems to take an absolute age to release the ball once he's held it up.

3857~~~
He definitely holds up the play.

3858~~~
I think it's obvious he's needs games in a system that actually works before we write him off. For the last 18 months he's been part of two very poor teams who've created few chances and the vast majority of our squad has looked poor. We now seem to have a clear plan and are dominating games and creating chances. We certainly owe him a chance to show he's still a top class striker in this system.

If Carrick isn't fit for the next game I suspect Van Gaal will play the Chelsea team but with RVP up front instead of Falcao. I certainly think we'd have gotten something out of the Chelsea game with RVP up front rather than the latter.

3859~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3860~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o-8n8H-IHsc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

This is from the first half of this season, and I honestly can't see a real difference compared to highlights from his peak seasons. Maybe a bit unlucky, like at 2:28, if that goes through Hart's legs it's a legendary goal.

Can't see him leaving this summer although you never know for sure. But our strikeforce is great, Wazza still has some great years, RVP is 50-50 for me, the moment he hits form you have an absolute monster. We need that if we want succes next year.

3861~~~
I don't know, I've heard that argument a lot of times but I never really got it... Like, if he's injured, its not like he's resting. He's working harder then normal to get his body back to a playing level so that wears it out more then if he was fit and playing a match... At least that's how I always saw it.

3862~~~
Yeah, what you're saying makes sense and it's certainly been borne out by what we've seen on the pitch.

3863~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3864~~~
Glad he got 60 minutes, hopefully on the bench for Everton but if Carrick/Blind are still out he's a better option than Falcao.

3865~~~
Don't forget about Zlatan, who had his best season last year.

3866~~~
I still think, fitness permiting, he can lead the line for us. Especially in a better functioning lineup. I don't think he's look as bad as people are making out to be.

3867~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3868~~~
I agree, I am certain he would get 20 goals in the current setup. However, Rooney being captain will always play and hopefully up-front meaning RvP won't be a starte,  for me this is the problem rather than RvP being past it.

3869~~~
How unfit or out of form is RVP that we're turning to Falcao off the bench before him.

3870~~~
He should've come on much sooner than he did.

3871~~~
Great display, he showed what we've been lacking up front all these games. <span style="color: #ffffff">Heh..</span>

3872~~~
Should play next week seeing that Rooney limped off.

3873~~~
I wonder why RvP didn't want to take the Captain's armband, offered by Rooney. Because he knew he's off this summer?

3874~~~
Or he reckoned he'd look like a proper wanker coming on for 5 minutes with a captain's armband in a team that's 3-0 down?

3875~~~
Why? would you think he's a wanker if he took it?

3876~~~
Also apparently had to be told by LVG to go applaud the away fans. That coupled with the armband thing, is there not right behind the scenes?

3877~~~
Who ended up taking the armband?

Can't blame van Persie for being a bit pissed off either, as bad as he has been this season he has still been twice the player Falcao has.

3878~~~
Smalling. Unless DDG commits a 5-yr contract, I think it's about right that Smalling's third in captain's ladder.

3879~~~
Even if DDG commits Smslling is a better choice.

3880~~~
You're right. Come to think of it, seems like DDG isn't  really vocal.

3881~~~
Rooney -> Carrick -> Smalling seems the right order for me.

3882~~~
100% pass completion rate <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3883~~~
Oh dear god if you lot are happy with Smalling as a captain for us.

3884~~~
Any other suggestions?

3885~~~
I can't believe he actually has 10 goals this season.

3886~~~
Got a couple tonight in the U21's away at Fulham, hopefully that's enough to see him on the pitch before Falcao.

3887~~~
If he remained fit and first choice the whole season, he'd have more than 15. Still decent.

3888~~~
Looked sharper than he has done in a while. Hit the woodwork twice as well. I hope he starts the next game. I've kind of written him off but would really like if he ended up making me eat my words, this season and next.

3889~~~
I think he still has a lot to offer and is being written off way too early. He's had a poor season and still has 10 goals. A lot of his appearances came when we were playing shite as a team as well trying to play Falcao alongside him up front. He's also shown good quality on the ball, but failed to create space, as a lone striker in a 4-3-3 I think he'll find a lot more freedom. He is still a great back-up striker.

3890~~~
Surely he's ready to start this week, assuming Rooney cant. NFW should Falcao be anywhere near the pitch at his expense.

3891~~~
If the reports are true and he is compliant in staying as second choice, I wouldn't mind. I don't think he's good enough to lead the line for the full season but delegating him a sizeable amount of matches in this particular system will do. For a year, at least.

3892~~~

3893~~~
Can't say that was the most impressive compilation I've seen. Some good touches, and two good finishes (especially the second one) but there was still a lot of what we've seen this season. Lots of lose touches, losing the ball easily, taking too long on the ball etc etc I have to say, a couple of times he really did look like an old man among kids. 

Interesting that he seemed to be playing quite deep, wonder if that was just so he was more involved?

3894~~~
That cross around the 4:00 min mark was beauty.

3895~~~
I think his legs are gone as far as competing in the PL goes, but If he's willing to play a bit part I'd prefer he stayed to us buying Ings or Jackson Martinez.

3896~~~
If we had 2011-2013 RVP we would have a massive chance of winning the league next season. 

We might as well play him against West Brom, let's see what he can do with this new system in place.

3897~~~
Good for him. 

He is the best striker at the club, would love it if he can stay fit and give us one more season like Fergie's last.

3898~~~
I thought he looked good. Promising signs.

3899~~~
I for one am looking forward to seeing RvP play as the lone striker and hopefully with Carrick and the rest of our starters.  I think he could still do quite a decent job under those circumstances, of course we need to see that.

3900~~~
Would he be able to do the role that Fellani is doing right now?

3901~~~
I doubt it. Fellaini's role is not just about being tall and winning aerial duels. It requires a different kind of movement, discipline and decision making. I doubt Van Persie, being a forward all his life, would choose the pass back if he gets even the smallest chance to shoot, or stay in position if he has space to make a run in. Plus, he's definitely not as strong and solid.

3902~~~
Hope to god he starts instead of Falcao if Rooney isn't fit.

3903~~~
Hope he starts regardless of Rooney's fitness level.

3904~~~
It's about his own fitness and sharpness. It those are back for a longer period, he's a class above Rooney as a centre forward. And it will be very difficult to find a striker who's would do the job just as well. But is an 'if', not a 'when'.

3905~~~
He doesn't need to be the RVP of old, he just needs to be a quarter of that and we're good.

3906~~~
The main keywords with Van Persie in discussing his talent are primarily fitness and work rate. At times he looks like the type of player positioning himself around the pitch with the thought that only athletes run and everyone else just plays games. He has a certain style of play consisting of what is called 'playing lines'. He bases his spurts around these playing lines, basically confusing defenders with unpredictable positioning. He has that killer instinct when he has full confidence but he needs to be involved in build ups  in order for him to feel that he can gradually grow into the game. Yes he can still appear like a phantom and create that unexpected chance from no man's land, but now at age 31 he needs the service of the system more then ever. Whether he should be picked ten faveure of Falcao is a no brainer. Pleased to see him scoring a few goals. Him picking up some confidence in the last stage of the competition could turn out to be valuable.

3907~~~
Looked sharper yesterday, hopefully he's fit enough to start at the weekend.

3908~~~
He can actually  be in better shape next year than he's been this season imo. World Cup drained him no end by all accounts and he'd also had that injury (if my memory serves me right) beforehand which took a good chunk of his second half of the season. Then he missed our pre-season which is all important. If he can relax in the summer and prepare well for the upcoming season he should be good.

3909~~~
With Rooney injure, RVP cannot do worse than Falcao so that's enough in my books for him to start.

3910~~~
Will he come straight back in now that he has had a game for the U/21s? Surely Falcao won't be given another chance if RvP is fit.

3911~~~
I agree. He's even admitted he wasn't fully recovered for the World Cup after that Olympiakos injury and that's possibly why his performances tailed off later in the knockout rounds. A few posters have mentioned that RvP said he'd done work in the gym and that he looked bigger in 2011-12/2012-13. If he's lost weight since then he can spend the time off this summer trying to get properly fit and working on that.

3912~~~
Agree with those saying that at this stage he needs the system to be serving him chances consistently. His movement in the box and finishing are still outstanding. Come on RVP son prove those doubters wrong!!

3913~~~
I hope Carrick is fit otherwise it will be slim pickings for RVP, as usual.

3914~~~
I think the same. He’s top class when he doesn’t have to run a lot. That’s hardly the case in the Prem but I see him as a perfect backup striker.

3915~~~
Just to let you know that being "big" is not the ideal physique for a top class footballer.
Some footballers are naturally bulkier than others, but to add weight on purpose is not the way forward.
The fittest footballers are usually waif-like. When footballers take their shirts off, you get to see just how skinny these guys actually are.
In fact, the moment a footballer begins to add weight, they get branded "fat", eg Rooney and Lampard.

3916~~~
He doesn't have legs to run isolated all game but he should have enough to play in the right system where the ball is played to him. He's never depended on his pace. He won't be any slower than this season and he still has a respectable attacking output per minutes. Bear in mind he mostly played at the time we were a shambles this season.

3917~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/robin-van-persie-reveals-how-1646892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/robin-van-persie-reveals-how-1646892</a>

OK, so it says it wasn't through lifting more weights but the point is that he was more muscular and he felt that had helped his game.

3918~~~
Do you reckon Robin will fit into this system as Rooney is out? Did he ever play as the main striker at a 4-3-3 at Arsenal

3919~~~
Not sure if he did at Arsenal, but he did for the worldcup qualifiers before Strootman got injured and van Gaal moved to 352. He can do it without a problem (theoretically).

3920~~~
Technique wise he's head and shoulders above anyone else up front. Personally I love the guy, it was great to see him playing with a smile on his face for the U21's. Something I haven't seen from him in a while for the first team. I really want to see how he plays as the focal point for our 4-3-3 as he hasn't played here yet, but I feel it's the position where he's most suited. Undoubtedly he's lost a yard of pace but everything else is still there and I think he's far from done at this level.

3921~~~
Is he asthmatic? He isn't visibly out of shape but was gasping for air and had a bad cough at HT too.

3922~~~
Disagree, I think he was excellent. He got in a few times and unlucky not to score 4 really. He looked sharp though. He made good runs and best of all he looked like he could run. He put himself about and took a few knocks but played and showed the correct attitude. At any level, it's not that easy with kids excited to play against you. As poor as they were, he put in a great shift. If he replicates that form in the first team, we'll be fine.

3923~~~
How was that not a foul on him though(2:10)?

3924~~~
Good chance he'll still feature with Rooney occupying the midfield.

3925~~~
Maybe he choked on his saliva?

3926~~~
His hold up play as a striker is on another level to Rooney. He was also our most dangerous player by a mile in the first half even though he isn't getting much service(something that Rooney's fans used as excuse for him not getting any shots in last few games). I definitely prefer him as a lone striker to Rooney but I am not sure if either of them should be our next season's number 1 striker.

3927~~~
He has been sharp today don't you agree.

3928~~~
Looks like he's running through treacle but his touch/shooting has been sharp.

3929~~~
Young's deflected shot was going in until it hit him. Has done feck all else to influence the game. Although that applies to all our attacking players.

3930~~~
Plays like a striker should play in this system.

3931~~~
You mean the shot that had feck all power on it? Was it really?

3932~~~
He's played well. He's looked our only hope of getting a goal.

3933~~~
The service has been atrocious tbf, almost non-existent.

3934~~~
Painfully slow, not just when running but also when receiving the ball, he just can't move it quick enough and the attack stops. He's better than Falcao but that's not hard to achieve.

3935~~~
Yes, really. The deflected shot. It was going in. Myhill was on his arse. Not Van Persie's fault, obviously. Far too close to the deflection to react.

3936~~~
That's a little harsh. Fecked up one promising attack with too many touches but don't remember that happening more than once.

3937~~~
Yes, because Myhill had committed the other way. 

Same old RvP, awfully laborious.

3938~~~
Van Persie has been one of our best performers. He offers so much more goal threat than Falcan't.

3939~~~
Done fairly well for his first game back but again he slowed us down in our most flowing move of the half. Frustrating, particularly as West Brom are very compact and hard to open up.

3940~~~
Well that's faint praise.

3941~~~
This. Van Persie's looked sharper, and better running the channels, than he has since Olympiakos (H) last year.

3942~~~
Why are there 2 different measures for Rvp and Rooney? Rvp has been threatening and has made the right runs, out of that volley we could have even scored (deflection). Has been fine.

3943~~~
Much better than Falcao. If I had to choose between the two for next season, RvP all the way.

3944~~~
He's playing really deep this half. What's that about? Is Fellanin our 9?

3945~~~
Looks like it. Such an odd formation. He's doing a great TClevz23 impression, though.

3946~~~
Yea - I agree. He can play the lone striker role, and do it well. Just a shame LvG decided to put him in midfield for the 2nd half (wtf).

3947~~~
Better midfielder than Rooney too, actually raises the tempo.

3948~~~
He's a fantastic footballer. Some of those passes have been incredible even for a midfielder.

3949~~~
He has been very good so far. Hasn't scored but I think that this is the best we have seen from his all round game this season.

3950~~~
Sure he does.

3951~~~
Not sure if sarcastic, but RVP has been miles better in midfield so far.

3952~~~
He's been exactly the same.

3953~~~
jinxed it

3954~~~
.. Rooney doesnt raise the tempo in midfield, just sideways as usual.

3955~~~
Penalty aside, he's offered a lot.

3956~~~
You just knew he was going to miss.

3957~~~
Very annoying that he missed the penalty, but actually played well that aside. Don't think LVG should have moved him though to CM.

3958~~~
Played really well, should have scored the penalty tho.

3959~~~
Rvp was absolutey fantastic today. Just really unlucky most opinions will be based on a missed penalty.

3960~~~
None of our players can take a good penalty these days. Always feel we will miss. Irritating.

3961~~~
He was definitely better in midfield than Rooney today. Rooney, as usual when he's in midfield, was just... so, so meh. Does nothing to drive the attack, and continued his one-man game of spraying the ball to the right, and he's not even very good at that at the moment.

3962~~~
Best player today but awful penalty.

3963~~~
Not too much wrong with the penalty. Could've perhaps positioned it better, but was very encouraged by his performance today. Does far, far more than Falcao.

3964~~~
Terrible penalty. Better than most otherwise.

3965~~~
Got to score penalties to win games... he was our best player otherwise.

3966~~~
Bergkamp esque today.

3967~~~
He probably costed us points with that penalty, but he was our best player by a mile IMO. Hopefully he can continue with good gamea.

3968~~~
It was an awful, awful penalty. 

Still, he was generally quite good and at least looked up for it.

3969~~~
Played well today tbh, him and Young are the only players that tried to create something.

3970~~~
I thought he was very good today. Should've bloody scored the penalty though.

3971~~~
I still can't understand why LVG removed him as the main striker and moved the big lump upfront.

3972~~~
When he played deeper he was pretty much always looking to push us forward and play through the middle. So frustrating with that penalty miss though. Good save but we really needed that. Very unlucky with the late volley.

3973~~~
decent game but that penalty miss was very, very annoying.

3974~~~
One of our better players. I quite like him in the deep role - it is a position he has played before, and I think it was more useful to us having Fellaini's physical presence up front to shield the ball and lay it off to others.

Promising. My concern is that if RVP merits a spot back in the starting lineup, it likely means Rooney in midfield, which is a problem.

3975~~~
Offered so much more than Falcao has recently managed throughout the match. Even so, not a great penalty when the keeper has already made his choice and gone.

3976~~~
Very poor penalty, but was good apart from that. I'd like to see him get a proper run in the team once Carrick is back and Herrera moves further forward. I think that could set up a lot of good chances for him, but of course Rooney and Fellaini will play ahead of RvP.

3977~~~
Had a good shot, missed a penalty, looked ok in midfield, nothing very encouraging though.

3978~~~
Missed the penalty but only player who looked like scoring.

3979~~~
Eh? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3980~~~
Our players cant shoot a penalty. Rooney always hits it in the same spot, just like RvP. Time to look up and see where the goalie goes before shooting.

3981~~~
Played well I thought, looked our most likely to create a chance and feed the ball into the striker or attacking players, had a few good shots on goal. Never felt like he'd score the penalty though, which is weird with RvP. It just felt like one of those days.

3982~~~
Apart from the penalty he did well.

3983~~~
He looked nervous taking that penalty but rather him take it than Rooney.

3984~~~
He was very good, even when he dropped back. It was encouraging.  

He kept picking Fellaini out to feet and we were making half chances from it. Surprised we didn't try it more when it was clearly working. 

Penalty miss was devastating, but it's one of those where the keeper guessed right he saves it.

3985~~~
There were a couple attempts at through passes to him today which was pleasantly surprising. Not very good ones mind you in fact a few were not even meant for him, however, once he has the ball he will always look dangerous.
The aim is to just get through the season with a CL place. I don't care how we do it but next season we need to get rid of the non-creative, skill-less midfielders.

3986~~~
Voted him my MOTM, despite the penalty miss (which wasn't a great penalty). He was by far our biggest goal threat and offered more than any other striker has recently. Glad to have him back.

3987~~~
stupid to shoot at his favourite spot

3988~~~
We do more than Falcao getting up to go for a piss at half time.

3989~~~
Actually wasn't bad. He was just denied by a keeper that decided to have his best game of the season today.

3990~~~
I used to think we would score every time he got the ball in the box 2 years ago. Now I'm never confident.

3991~~~
Still firmly believe he is our best striker. Generally when the ball is fired into van Persie it sticks to him, which you can't really say about Falcao or Rooney. Average penalty but he was good today. 

The conundrum for van Gaal will come when Carrick comes back. Will Rooney be benched? Doubt it although I'd be tempted to do it. I could definitely see him acting as the furthest forward in a midfield 3 in place of Fellaini with Rooney up top. I think that would work better than Rooney in midfield and van Persie up top.

3992~~~
If both Rooney and rvp are apparently undroppable we need to get rid of one ASAPASAP

3993~~~
Was better than Falcao. Which isn't saying much. What the FECK was he doing so deep in the second half though? Van Gaal takes the blame for that.

3994~~~
He was OK today.  Better than most, if not all, of the rest of the team.

3995~~~
He was pretty decent today so pushing him deep to play that lump of useless up front was bizarre.

3996~~~
I'd like him to start again but that would mean Rooney in midfield...

3997~~~
Harsh imo. Poor len but he had a decent game, particularly given he's been out so long.

3998~~~
I think he played well today.
No real complaints apart from the penalty.
If the WBA goalie didnt play so well, he'd almost certainly have scored.
It really shows what a real striker can do...rather than Falcao.

3999~~~
He swapped him for Fellaini, sort of worked in a way as RVP is actually a better passer, he was playing some nice passes into Fellaini's feet and making runs forward.

The fact it's even got to that point though is fairly ridiculous.

4000~~~
Was I drunk or was he playing CM at one point behind Rooney and Fellaini?

Thought he played pretty well.

4001~~~
I think he looked pretty good today, difficult as it is to judge when the overall team performance was so poor. He made good runs and was mostly sharp on the ball. Also thought he was solid in midfield, strange decisions as that was to have him play so deep.

4002~~~
Rooney tends to score the result affecting penalties.

I'm struggling to think of a pen he's missed where we haven't already been ahead.

4003~~~
He played well, but I'm not sure that it was the right call to let him have a penalty right after he earns his first start in months.

4004~~~
Our best player today despite just coming back from injury. Also didn't look completely useless in midfield (still should have never ended up there).

4005~~~
Wasn't 'very good' as some people are claiming but he wasn't bad either. Should have scored the penalty, he's slowed down a lot looks like age is catching up to him, we desperately need a younger more energetic striker next season, don't mind RVP staying but he should be a bench player.

4006~~~
I didnt mind him taking the penalty tbh. I think Rooney should be off them completely as he never looks confident he will score them despite being a striker.

He played well first half, and was one of our better players up top. So of course, that means he ended up dropping deep into midfield lol.

4007~~~
He looked sharp but doesn't suit the way the others like to play particularly Mata and Herrera with the quick give and go passing. It's frustrating when he kills moves by holding on to it for too long. 

Rooney might not always star but he knows how to keep his game simple and adapt to his teammates, he should be first choice striker.

4008~~~
If he scored that penalty we would've won that game. It was the right time and we really had them reeling.

4009~~~
I agree. We don't really have a great penalty taker, but I'd have preferred Rooney at that point. I know his overall record isn't the best, but the ones he does score are mostly really good penalties, nestled right into the side netting. Impossible to save. He has a great technique most of the time. Just sometimes he forgets how to take them and puts it at perfect height for the keeper to save, like the one against Liverpool.

I just knew RVP was going to miss. At the point in the game with the pressure on, I was hoping Robin would just twat it down the middle.

4010~~~
He did play well. 

While I agree he should not have been appointed to take the penalty, the way his penalty was saved, it could have happened to any one. Their goalie had an enormous luck and performance today. I do think RvP has not disappointed after his long absence.

4011~~~
Hard to blame him for today, but then again we are stronger with Rooney as lone striker. These formations without Carrick where Rooney is asked to play various other roles seem to always unbalance our attack.

4012~~~
Van Persie is now a midfielder? *Brenton Rodgers smiley*

feck me, what was that about? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4013~~~
Never thought I would ever see RVP in central midfield, in saying that, I never thought I would see Phil Jones taking corners. So it's not the biggest shock.

4014~~~
He was good but you must score goals as a striker especially with so many chances like today.
This

4015~~~
He thinks this is FIFA.

4016~~~
Strange thing to say when Van Persie played there many times for Arsenal and Holland. Van Persie was only converted into a traditional no. 9 in 2010 before then he was a no.10

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WFPs3vHQOFg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

4017~~~
Well, I don't think number 10 is a central midfielder. But that's just me.

4018~~~
Bingo. Van Persie didn't have a good game at all. No matter how desperate people were for him to vindicate their pleas to start him. Slowed down our football and, penalty aside, he missed the one good chance in the game (an absolute sitter) I don't think it's a coincidence that his return came in a game where our performance exactly mirrored the slow, labourious football that was such a pain to watch in the earlier parts of the season.

4019~~~
I don't think van Persie played particularly well but putting the performance down to him is crazy considering we played the exact same way last week without him, only worse. I don't think he's in any way responsible for Mata, Fellaini, Herrera or Rooney's drop in form considering the dip started before he came back into the team. 

Van Persie today was more dangerous than Rooney in his last few games up front, IMO. Not great at all but decent enough.

4020~~~
You're right. It's not down to him. It's down to the absence of Carrick. That much is painfully obvious. We're a completely different team without him.

I thought Rooney was awful against Everton (he always is) but we looked better against Chelsea, going forwards, than we did yesterday. Which I put down to Rooney being more dynamic than Van Persie. Who just slows everything down, far too much.

Not to mention that any striker who misses a pen and a sitter as obvious as the one Young set up (plus accidentally blocking a certain goal) has to play bloody well to make up for those incidents. And he didn't play bloody well, at all. Can you <i>imagine</i> the hatred on here if Rooney had been involved in those three events?

4021~~~
I think he's 'gone' - little movement from him now, Fellaini held the ball up better.  Did OK in MF as it happens, but I won't be nominating RVP, Rooney & Fellaini for the Best Front 3 Thread.  Don't think they can play together, really ponderous.

Rooney is our best 'up top' striker, (see results).

4022~~~
Wouldn't that be down to Falcao?

I do agree he slows things down an awful lot but there's a lot he offers to offset that. He missed a sitter but that started with him flicking the ball on and making a great run across the front post. We've seen very little of that from Rooney. He managed to work the keeper a few times from half chances too, and he had the most "key passes" in the team today. I don't know exactly how they define that but he played a lovely dinked ball through to Mata and found Fellaini in good positions a number of times. A lot more often than Rooney, that's for sure. He's slowing the game down but he's also picking out the right pass more often, IMO.

4023~~~
I know he missed a feck-tonne of chances, but I thought Van Persie did well considering how long he's been out for.

I still hold out hope that, with a full summer's rest and injury free pre season, we'll see the best of him next season.

4024~~~
Yes. My bad. Falcao played against Chelsea. Which actually fits what I'm saying. Everton was an aberration but we've looked far better with Rooney up top than either of the other two. Obviously, the Carrick issue muddies the waters.

4025~~~
If the Carrick issue is him not being there, it seems to knacker everything.  Who plays where, how we move the ball about, central defenders bringing it into MF then looking lost, how quickly it gets spread wide to be crossed, movement up the front.....

4026~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that agenda thread is you all over.

4027~~~
It must really hurt Pongue Mahone that in one game Van Persie showed that he is a better striker and midfielder than Rooney.

4028~~~
He didn't, so I'm sure Pogue will survive.

4029~~~
I also think it's harsh on RVP especially when he does play, it's usually Rooney in midfield behind him. We haven't seen him in a lone striker with a proper midfield, which Rooney had. And let's be honest Rooney was hardly brilliant in any of those six games. Before someone points out the silent domination.

4030~~~
The main concern yesterday was the he was the only player trying to pass the ball forward and find space with his passing. He was the only one that was playing the ball into Fellaini, Herrera's passing was shit yesterday, while the Silent Dominator was hitting his trademark crossfield balls all day.

He was better than Rooney in midfield yesterday, but I think it was because the game suited his more technical approach more. Idealy none of them should be playing there.

I really liked his movement in the first half, he managed to find space even in WBAs congested defense. Looked a little weak on the ball, tho, put him in the gym for the summer and he will be great next year.

4031~~~
You really have to admire <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a>, just like Ronaldo, as obviously ridiculous as his behaviour can be, he just doesn't give a s***. Just like Pogue, as obviously ridiculous as his pro Rooney and anti RvP stance is, he always insists on it irrespective of how both players play and how his posts come across to other posters.

4032~~~
In comparison with the other attacking players, he was good yesterday.

4033~~~
can we not give De Gea a crack at centre mid before he goes?

4034~~~
Credit where it's due, he was getting into the right positions, getting shots on target and making those off-ball runs, other than that, yeah. Can't understand why we'd move him to CM as well, should've either taken him, Rooney or Fellaini off.

4035~~~
You're right on at least one point (unusually for you) I really don't care what anyone thinks about me.

Moving back to discussing football (can you manage that?) I need to make something clear to our resident cretins. I thought Rooney was crap yesterday. I think Van Persie had a better game. Capiche?

That being said, Van Persie wasn't great at all. Marginally better than Rooney vs Everton, at best. Some decent movement, a few good passes but frequently took too many touches and didn't strike the ball cleanly at goal. Now what would have happened if the "sitter" Rooney missed in that game had been as straightforward as Van Persie's chance yesterday <b>and</b> he missed a penalty? I think we all know exactly what comments his thread would be full of. The criticisms would make my posts about Van Persie seem a model of restraint.

Anyhoo. Toodle-pip, gimps. I think I've made my point as clearly as I can.

4036~~~
Typical of you. Didn't expect anything else. Keep on with your predictable posts. Maybe one day you will get bored of your own posts after all ... One can only hope.

4037~~~
Ouch.

4038~~~
It was a shit penalty. 

That said, Rooneys missed plenty.

4039~~~
Well if he's not taking them then who is?
Can't be Rooney, he's got one of the worst records of any regular taker going.
Maybe it'll be Phil Jones after his stint on corners.

4040~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I will not be surprised.

4041~~~
Mata maybe?

4042~~~
Genuinely wouldn't be surprised.

4043~~~
We need to find a new taker then because Rooney's not totally dependable on spot kicks either.

4044~~~
You've shown up your bias here better than anyone else could've done. Van Persie was better yesterday than Rooney has been since the Spurs game. I'm sure you would judge Rooney coming back from injury in the exact same manner. Both will need to be much better from here if we're going to challenge for the title next year because Chelsea and City both currently have forwards they can depend on and we don't.

4045~~~
Sign Gundogan for his penalties

4046~~~
You just knew he was going to miss that penalty.

4047~~~
Harsh to take him off penalties on the back of one miss. Rooney missed against Liverpool (and I assume he is the one that will be taking them now).

4048~~~
Rooney isn't good with penalties but they somehow never seem to cost us when he misses them.

4049~~~
This is surely fake? Such a weird thing for a manager to state publicly, especially given Rooney missed one recently as well.

4050~~~
Nope.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32575218" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32575218</a>

4051~~~
Ah! He also mentions Rooney is also at the bottom of the list as he missed, that's a pretty odd way to go with your penalty taker IMO.

4052~~~
If Phil Jones will ever be again on the penalty spot for us then i will run on the pitch and do everything possible to stop him to take the penalty!!!

4053~~~
Regards the penalty, it happens.....However, it happens too many times with us for my liking.
We had great penalty takers before, who never let the pressure get to them....Eric, Keane(In shootouts), RVN etc....So called world class footballers can't put it in the corner from 12 yards?! At Old Trafford?!....Rooney needs to have a look at himself in that regard to...His record is abysmal and shameful 

As for RVP's performance....I thought he looked sharp and very threatening....Him in midfield though is beyond me

EDIT: "No, he's at the end of the road!" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Found that funny sorry

4054~~~
England's brave lionheart Phil Jones....Like having Waddle take a penalty....Grim!!

4055~~~
So mata to take our spot kicks then?

4056~~~
Has to be said, that's a really stupid policy. If it's "one strike and you're out" then that increases the pressure on the penalty taker each time he takes a pen. Which is the last thing a manager should be doing.

4057~~~
Was he ever on the penalty spot?

4058~~~
What a bad management by LVG.

4059~~~
"Robin no longer fits the profile of my penalty kick Philosophy...."

4060~~~
Rvp is a striker, he didn't score, didn't set up a goal, the team didn't score, missed a penalty, missed a sitter and blocked an almost certain goal, how the hell does that translate into having a good game?

4061~~~
Not sure how this new development will have influence on "RvP is adopted LvG`s son" brigade,they already took a blow when Falcao was in front of picking order when RvP was fit but not LvG fit,they tho that he will be treated differently.

4062~~~

4063~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The look on his face as he was walking up to the spot was bloody classic.

4064~~~
Great way of instilling confidence in your players.

4065~~~
Same here.

4066~~~
He didn't play up front for half the game. I'm also not sure how having the ball struck at him is his fault.

4067~~~
That technique.

Really, his body and arms were all over the place. So weird.

4068~~~
Jones the Pen.

I see the method in having had Phil on the corners now.  You have to spot the ball up and welly it in the general direction of the goal.

From much further away too.

It'll be great, <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>.

4069~~~
I still have trust in van Persie.

How many times has he actually played as the lone striker since Fergie left? He got his chance in the first half vs WBA and looks so threatening. Then annoyingly got moved back in the second half. 

He needs to play and be the main striker in my opinion.

4070~~~
won't be surprised if he pops up in a deep playmaker role tomorrow

4071~~~
Any idea what happened to him?

4072~~~

4073~~~
Is this the end of RvP at United?

4074~~~
He's on 200k a week and is a squad player at best now, we need him off the books.

Thanks for that great season Robin you were unstoppable but his legs have completely gone, it's all downhill from here.

4075~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

4077~~~
Sensationalist headline. He missed training because of a bug so LVG didn't pick him.

4078~~~
I'll miss Bouchra <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>.

4079~~~
I thought Ladyman is decent?

4080~~~
I'd be more then happy if both Falcao & RVP left in the Summer. Two huge names, on huge wages, who are way past it, and contribute very little (nothing).

4081~~~
Everytime i watch this i can't help but feel he was screwed over by Ferguson. 

<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/120343063" width="500"></iframe>

4082~~~
feck I miss that Van Persie <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

He was so so good that season.

4083~~~
Please score the winner against your old club this weekend.

4084~~~
How was he screwed over?

4085~~~
that feeling of 2 seasons ago whenever rvp has the ball at his feet anywhere 15-25 yards from goal. damn i miss that. you just knew he was going to pull the ball to his left foot and then bang!

4086~~~
Feeling more and more like he'll be off in the summer.

4087~~~
That Aston Villa volley goal, watching that live. That feeling ...

4088~~~
According to today's Guardian it may well be.

4089~~~
is it the piece by Jackson? if it's so, nothing new to hear from that then, recycling a quote with some unrelated info

4090~~~
I love Van Persie but I hope Fenerbache can convince him to join them next season. We need some new blood.

4091~~~
Ferguson promised him he had no thought of retiring when he signed. He mentioned in his book that he owed Van Persie an apology but it was an honest and unavoidable mistake and he wasn't being devious.

4092~~~
Yep. He brought back that fear upfront that we'd missed ever since Ronaldo left (and miss again now) He was the one player that I just felt, if we give him the ball anywhere near the area, something is going to happen. I remember one game at home, where he was on the bench (think it was West Brom) and we couldn't get that second goal to secure the points, he came on and dispatched an absolute beauty. And it just felt inevitable. 

Damn shame it only lasted 1 season for us. If only we'd been able to get him a few years earlier.

4093~~~
He won the PL and gets very well paid. And right now he plays under another manager he likes

I dont feel overly sorry for him

Still worth every penny for that season

4094~~~
He was brilliant that season. It was like you expected him to score every match bar that drought where you thought when will he score. I really wan't that Van Persie back where he was clearly enjoying his football. 

Was his last season at Arsenal better than he first season here? I know he got a few more goals but his all round play, how was it?

4095~~~
Absolutely. Sooner or later he'll be welcoming Kevin Strootman here so he can definitely refer United as home.

He has a mentor of youngsters status in the club just like in national team which makes him still a highly respectable squad figure despite dip in form.

4096~~~
He should just quit the national team and we can get a few more years out of him.

4097~~~
Surprised he didn't do this after the World Cup to be honest.

4098~~~
And Van Gaal isn't really in a position to demand or suggest it, since he was more than happy to use him for Holland, even when RVP was only half fit. 

Would probably be better for United, but for Holland we still need him because Robben is a massive crock too and we're 3th in the fecking qualifiers behind Iceland and the Czech Republic <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4099~~~
I doubt it. He is way too crocked at this point. Even if continues to play for an extra season or two, he wont be effective anymore.

4100~~~
yep still remember that, not sure about the opponent though but he came on and got that 2nd goal from the edge of the box. he was just brilliant that season.

4101~~~
Yea it was West Brom.  I think it was pouring rain that night.

4102~~~
So Rooney's out, he's got an opportunity to rub it in Arsenal again.

4103~~~
I thought he retired from the national team. Surely its in his best interest.

4104~~~
He'll do well in Italy next year.

4105~~~
He was much better and more clinical last season, I though he would return to his best under LVG but he just doesn't have his shooting boots on any more.

4106~~~
I wonder if we might see him in midfield again against Arsenal. If Rojo can't play then we'll have to use Blind at LB with Herrera as the #6 and everyone ahead moving back a position.

4107~~~
Think we're more likely to see Di Maria in midfield leaving Van Persie up top, if Blind has to be left back.

4108~~~
I'm not sure we'll ever see LvG risk Di Maria in midfield again in truth, he's too erratic for the possession based style he demands.

4109~~~
Yeah, more likely would be Mata in the middle with Di Maria out wide on the right I think. Either way, better then Rvp in midfield and Falcao up top probably.

4110~~~
I could see that switch instead, and we could get away with Mata in midfield against Arsenal as they aren't a physical team. Of course if Rojo can't play I wouldn't be surprised to see LvG use the 3-5-2.

4111~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ewFBzMk-w3Y?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

4112~~~
3 goals in 5 games against Arsenal isn't a bad record <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4113~~~
What a player RvP was. Probably my second favourite united player after Ronaldo I've watched. He just kept scoring worldies every week and his all round game was also a joy to watch. I guess the Moyes appointment must have just mentally destroyed him.

4114~~~

4115~~~
He owes us one more goal against Arsenal, he's one of the few players i'll forever be indebted to...

4116~~~
Sadly over the last two seasons he has owed us a bit more than a goal against his old club. I would prefer to go with Falcao simply because RVP looks so off the pace. If he has a swansong Sunday I think it will be his last for us at OT.

4117~~~
Rvp looks off the pace, and Falcao doesnt? Rvo has been miles better than Falcao this season, he cant even manage to stand on his feet.

4118~~~
My point was his future and that comes down to brittleness. Even as a sub he picks up something. He's brittle where as Falcao can actually see a game through. As far as I have seen Falcao has been regularly grounded because he constantly has someone snapping at his ankles. He is more tightly marked than any other players I have watched this season.

4119~~~
You're a Liverpool or Arsenal fan I guess?

<span style="color: #ffffff">ok that's a joke erm.....not really</span>

4120~~~
We knew what we were getting when we signed him, it was nothing more than a power move for Fergie to leave on a high.

4121~~~
Agreed.

4122~~~
Great post, the best I have ever received.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4123~~~
He's been our best performing striker this year, but that is not down to his performances which have been far from good, it's because Falcao and Rooney(when he played as a striker) were shit.

4124~~~
Im glad that you took it as banter. TBF I am crap on that and that often makes me enemies.

On a serious note, I acknowledge that RVP hasn't had the best of seasons. However he's been much better than Falcao. Having said that, if I was LVG I'll put them both on the bench and play Rooney instead.

4125~~~
Rooney's been better.

4126~~~
He's been better overall, but no way he was better when he played as a striker.

4127~~~
He has, but it hasn't been significant in any way, this is one of those arguments that could go either way - our whole strike force has been abysmal.

4128~~~
He has.

4129~~~
It's a bit of a pointless discussion really. RVP got injured against Swansea, a week later Wazza scored two against Sunderland. But Falcao started that game as the #9. He got subbed off, Rooney then moved to the striker's position, but his first goal was a penalty (Falcao was pulled down) so that goal wasn't down to him playing as a striker. Then Wes Brown got sent off. Sunderland were desperate, and in the 84th minute Rooney scored his second goal, at home against a piss poor side, 11 vs. 10 when they were desperately pushing for an equalizer and there was all the space in the world. This was the 28th of Februari.

Ever since then, Rooney has scored 3 goals in 11 matches. One directly after he was moved into midfield against Aston Villa, so he was not playing as a striker anymore. Leaving the grand total of two goals when playing as a striker since Februari 28th, one nice header against Arsenal in a game we lost. And one nice goal against Tottenham in a game we won.

I love RVP to death, but if there's one man I wouldn't mind outperforming him, then it's Wazza who I also adore. So I don't think there's any bias talking when I say Rooney has definitely not been a better #9 than Van Persie over the last months. 

For me it's been the same story for a whole season, we simply don't play well enough and don't have the consistent quality as a team to make it work for our forwards. We have Wazza who, contrary to what some people on here seem to believe, is one of the best players in the world and he's in his absolute physical prime. Yet we still couldn't set him up for a goal in the two best matches we played, completely domintating against City & Liverpool. That sums up our problems for me.

As for RVP, of course I hope he'll score tomorrow, but it'll be very difficult. The moment Carrick is out we struggle, and Arsenal have been in very good form recently and they already beat us this season at Old Trafford. I don't think Van Persie is really past it though, I've seen him playing for Holland last year when he was just back from that heavy meniscus injury. He wasn't fit at all and had zero match rhythm, yet he still managed to score some of best goals in his career. For me he has to just way too much class to be past it already, he's no 34 yet. But we'll see.

4130~~~
So apparently Falcao starting again tomorrow (yay). RVP injured again?

4131~~~
Didn't LVG recently say that he always starts players against their former clubs?

4132~~~
I vaguely remember Van Gaal declaring both Di Maria and Van Persie fit to play at yesterday's presser. So if he's fit and doesn't start either the writing really is on the wall, or Van Gaal wants to balance everything out between the players because RVP has still gotten a huge amount of matches despite being injured a lot.

I believe something similar happened with Mata around Februari, during he played almost everything the first half of the season and Van Gaal said he wasn't dissapointed in him, but he felt others were doing well in training and deserved a chance too, and with his talk about honesty and all he benched Mata for quite some time before starting him again.

4133~~~
If it's true that Falcao is starting he's either injured or he starts in midfield because Rojo couldn't make it.

4134~~~
Wow.

4135~~~
Yeah shocking right...

4136~~~
No one seems to be spouting all that nonsense about Van Persie being Van Gaals "love child" anymore.

4137~~~
Yes, shocking. Genuinely.

4138~~~
Do you ever watch other teams? Most people consider Real, Bayern and Barca the best three teams in the world at the moment.

Why wouldn't Rooney start ahead of Benzema, who hasn't scored 20 goals in La Liga for three seasons running?

Lewandowski is on 16 goals in the Bundesliga with Bayern doing teams for fun, Rooney is on 12 goals in the Premier League while playing in midfield for half a season in a team that has struggled a lot. Pretty sure he would start ahead of Lewa.

Suarez is only 14 months younger than Wayne, has never played in midfield, played in a very inferior Dutch league. Still Rooney has scored as much goals in his club career as he did. He's on great form, but I have little doubt Rooney couldn't bang in the same amount Suarez has, playing with the likes of Neymar, Messi, Iniesta.

Mourinho was all over him last summer, maybe because he wanted a mediocre player to fill his squad? Or will he go down in the history as that 'decent' player who became England's and Manchester United's all time top scorer? I don't think so.

And then there's Rooney not as a striker, where he is an even better player in my opinion. I remember him scoring in a Champions League final with Chicha as the #9, scored that goal against City with Berba on the pitch, scored a brace against City the last time we won the league playing behind RVP. Not to forget scoring 27 league goals or so playing mostly as a second striker or what SAF reffered to as a '#10'. He'd be more than fine, and I personally think he's even better there than as a true #9. At Chelsea Mourinho would probably play him in the Oscar role I think, not in Diego Costa's spot unless he was injured.

He's a truly unique player, definitely one of the best in the world in my book.

4139~~~
There was barely anything between peak van Persie and peak Rooney. van Persie would score more goals out of nothing, but he'd also miss more sitters. There record at number-nine was similar too.

4140~~~
plus one

4141~~~
Great post.
Agree 100%

4142~~~
Good post.  People don't seem to appreciate how good Wayne Rooney is sometimes.

4143~~~
Good post, but you're going on and om about the Rooney of the past, and only talk about the Rooney as of now in 1 paragraph, the main point is, that Rooney has declined and isnt as good as he was before. He's living off his reputation, because his last world class season was in 2011'2012. He's scored 4 goals in 13 games as a striker, how does that result in ; if he'd play as a striker all season, he'd scored 25+ (some of the posts in the Rooney thread)? It is based on absolutely nothing. Rooney has been a great player for us in the past, but he hasnt been more than a good player for the past 3 seasons.

4144~~~
Have to agree with that. I thought Rooney's best season for us was as a number 9 as well.

4145~~~
Absolutely agree, top post.

4146~~~
Some of his performances have been very poor this season.

Also I have no idea why you are comparing Rooney to Suarez. Suarez right now and last season is light years ahead of Rooney in pretty much every aspect.

4147~~~
Fair enough, though as you can see I also posted about Rooney's form as a striker in a post above the one you've reacted to. I just really think it's been difficult for our strikers. And they've scored some goals at least, I believe a player like Di Maria hasn't scored a goal in six months. And looking at the whole team, there have been way too many quality players under performing. I just can't see them all coincidentally being permanently past it at the same time.

Then I look at a team like Juve for example, I would say it's not so much Tevez and Morata being much better strikers than Rooney, Van Persie or even Falcao. I look at their team, and like United they have a great goalkeeper. A better left back with Evra, a much more solid central defense with Bonucci and Chiellini (we have talent there but not experience and consistency), a better right back with Lichtsteiner. Then looking at their midfield the difference with United is even bigger, doesn't get much better than Pirlo, Pogba, Vidal, Marchisio. Way more experience and leadership in their squad too. For me that's the reason Tevez and Morata were able to excell and be decisive and Juve went through in the Madrid ties, much more than their strikers being of superior quality to for example our strikers.

Or even more simply put, I think Juventus probably could've had the same results with this season's Rooney and this season's Van Persie up front instead of Tevez and Morata. Because having a good team behind you is vital for all forwards in the world, except maybe Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar.

4148~~~
There is so much wrong with that Rooney post that it's hard to get myself down to post a proper reply

4149~~~
You do have a point, but I dont agree completely. Tevez can force things out of himself, he still has the hunger to score, take defenders on, dribble, make runs, shoot from distance and frequently produces moments of brilliance, that's quite individual, Rooney and RvP are overly reloant of service and fail to produce individually. They'd be better at Juventus than here, but their style of play and energy they have, isnt good enough for the highest level anymore. It isnt as if Austin, or Benteke gets that much more service at their respective clubs for example, but they set themselves up to score, by their positioning, dynamism, strength, those are the things Rooney and Rvp have really regressed in, not to talk about Falcao.

4150~~~
I agree with the general point but some of the arguments here are just silly.

4151~~~
To be honest I can't say I noticed Rooney's lack of energy this season. And RVP's last two games for us, against Swansea and WBA (disregarding the 5 minute Everton sub) I thought he looked like our most dangerous attacking player, but we lost those games so then there aren't many positives. Been wondering about Austin and Benteke performing better myself. One big reason that deserves to be mentioned is that some teams just do not want to play at all against us. Against WBA for example, they had no problems with having 8(!) players in their own box during big parts of the match, it gets very difficult then.

Well at least that's more interesting than waking up to all those 100% agree posts, started feeling like Captain Obvious for trying to point out Rooney is still a very good player.

Any news on RVP by the way, is he still definitely not starting? Really not sure what to make of that.

4152~~~
What a shite cameo. Zero fecks given. I thought he would have something to play for, but looks like he couldn't be arsed.

4153~~~
Goodbye.

4154~~~
Out the door hopefully.

4155~~~
That was pretty dreadful.

4156~~~
At least Falcao adds movement to the forward line, Van Persie ads nothing except boredom and offsides.

Its time to go Van Persie.

4157~~~
Great post!

4158~~~
Offload him and Falcao asap.

Thanks for the 20th league title, RvP.

4159~~~
How many times did we actually pass the ball to him?

4160~~~
Walking about. Prick.

4161~~~
Bye bye RVP.

4162~~~
Of all our strikers he has the worst positioning, it's almost impossible for his teammates to find him.

4163~~~
I know where this is going, at least Falcao positioned well.....how do you pass to a striker who doesn't run and doesn't even position well?

4164~~~
Wilson would have been a better sub for sure.

4165~~~
He'd have tried at the very least.

4166~~~
Didn't even bother to try and get onside at times.

4167~~~
It's very safe to say we need to buy a striker this summer.  

Whether any club would be willing to take Robin's wages remains to be seen.

4168~~~
Doesn't position well? Van Persie's movement is excellent. A lot of shite being drawn from 30 minutes of a match United had stopped playing in.

4169~~~
Didn't look arsed. To be fair Arsenal were in the ascendancy when he came on but he was much better against West Brom the other week.

4170~~~
Dunno... But however many times it was... He was offside.

4171~~~
This formation is great for possession but we can be so risk adverse sometimes. Its like the players can barely put a cross in the box or try to thread a pass to our strikers. They are so starved of service its not even funny.

4172~~~
Once or twice then? He ends up offside because he's trying to make runs off the shoulder of a defence. It doesn't mix with a player not moving.

4173~~~
Actually, few times. And he didn't even try to fight for the ball at least 2 or 3 times which were 50-50 duels. Only excuse could be that he is carrying an injury but I doubt van Gaal would give him 30 minutes then. I like him but that was definitely embarassing cameo.

4174~~~
His movement certainly wasn't excellent today, He has been average for 2 seasons now, its time for him to go.

4175~~~
Is that why he was caught offside about a million times.

4176~~~
In 30 minutes of a game Utd had stopped playing in. There was a few times he made runs and that ball was played out wide rather than into his feet. I doubt we playe the ball into his feet more than twice in those 30 minutes.

4177~~~
So are you saying we should keep him? if he cant perform in 30 minutes what the feck is he going to in 90 minutes? we were still very much in the game till the last minute.....like i said, his positioning was terrible, heck even Falcao looked sharper. FALCAO.

4178~~~
Yes I believe we should. If we can get somebody better then happy days but I think he still has something to offer. There's just a lot of children on here. Falcao in no way looked sharper. Van Persie actually managed to threaten to score. Despite 'standing' around the whole game apparently. We were shite in that second half.

4179~~~
Ridiculous hyperbole isn't going to help your argument. Strikers tend to get caught offside when they try to make runs in behind. Even at his best Van Persie got caught offside a lot. It's an occupational hazard.

4180~~~
You mean the ball he wasted? if we actually want to contend next season then RVP has to go, we dont need what he has to offer - i hate when people say that like he still has the ability to change a game from the bench.

4181~~~
Anonymous when he come on today. Would have preferred to leave Falcao on. At least he got involved. That said, it's hard to come on in such a game and make an impact.

4182~~~
He will be gone with Falcao.

4183~~~
Wasn't arsed today.  I still think he should stay with Falcao leaving.

4184~~~
At least Falcao puts defenders under pressure with some effort and makes himself felt, I dont even know if RvP  looks particuarly interested anymore, perhaps i'm reading something that isnt there, I dont know anymore.

4185~~~
You mean like Walcott ?

4186~~~
needs a new challenge..possibly at Hull

4187~~~
The incredibly difficult chance on the half volley? Yes. There's very little objectivity on these forums. It really has gone to the dogs. I think I'll leave it here.

4188~~~
I agree, i think his performances in the 2012/13 season have blinded a lot of people.

4189~~~
True, but it's hard to compare. 1) they're different positions, 2) Arsenal were starting to get on top before Walcott come on and saw a lot more of the ball than RVP.

This is not me trying to defend RVP, though. Think he could have done more, and as others have suggested, Wilson probably would have been a better player to bring on, especially with Arsenal pushing for the equaliser, where I could imagine Wilson's work rate and pace in behind would have troubled them.

4190~~~
It's a shame we didn't see Van Persie as the one striker while the team was playing well like in the first half. That's just bad luck for him, because I haven't seen Falcao or Rooney doing thing he couldn't do better. 

I'm open to the idea that he's past it, especially concerning long term fitness. But If you look at his three best matches this season, there are not many strikers available who could match performances like those.

4191~~~
Our pressing from the front ceased the moment he came on, we just can't keep on with him and Falcao as striker options, we need a fresh injection up top.

4192~~~
I'm edging towards him joining Falcao out of the door this summer. We need a bit more dynamism up there that neither of them can provide anymore it seems.

We can also save a hell of a lot in wages offloading the pair of them.

4193~~~
We need a new focal point up top - and I include Rooney in those not good enough anymore to be that man. Wilson needs more experience before he is considered. Falcao, Rooney and RVP are all past their best. Kane sticks out like a sore thumb as the player who could best fill that role.

4194~~~
I'll be amazed if he leaves this summer. High wages. Minimal interest from other clubs. LVG clearly rates him above his performance level this season otherwise Wilson would have been given a run of games to make a case for himself. 

So another underwhelming season to look forward to before RVP eventually leaves.

4195~~~
I stopped blaming any of our strikers long ago. One world class striker can turn into shite, maybe two but not all 3 at the same time. The problem is elsewhere on the pitch.

4196~~~
His career at the top level is done unless he gets played as a second striker rather than a lone one expected to dominate centre backs and have great movement like he used to. Sadly he's slower now than his ever been. However, technically he'll never be anything but excellent, and he's the sort of player that can be a threat from an area in the offensive third.

4197~~~
He needs to go, along with Falcao.

4198~~~
Van Persie and Falcao as your strikers and there is a lack of goals. Only at United.

4199~~~
pretty much this, something isn't right.

4200~~~
But 3 'world class strikers' haven't just 'turned into shit at the same time'...

Rooney - He's basically been the exact same Rooney he's been over the last few years, ever since 09/10 really. Sometimes fantastic, sometimes average, sometimes shite. If anything, I'd say he's been better this season, then the last two.

Falcao - He hasn't actually been 'world class Falcao' for two years now, something that never gets mentioned. People thought (hoped) we were getting Athletico Falcao, but we weren't. Its been two years since he left Athletico, and since then he went to France and underwhelmed, suffered the third ACL injury of his career, and is also nearing 30. Its not really a surprise that his injury + age + trying to adapt to a physical league has resulted in a massive drop off. Its pretty obvious how much the physical aspects of his game has declined since his days in La Liga.

RVP - He's been in a steady decline ever since his first season here. He spent half of last, and this season injured, and is now into his 30's. He's also suffered a hell of a lot of injuries over his career, which wont have helped the ageing process. Like Falcao, he's clearly lost a good yard of pace, and he also looks physically shot.

To blame Falcao and RVP's declines on other areas of the pitch is just wrong.

4201~~~
Just let him go to America (the MLS), I say.

4202~~~
Following on from my Di Maria post. This will surprise a few. Statistically, given any chance, RVP is still the safest bet for a shot on target from any PL striker.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.co.uk/blog/tactics-and-analysis/67/post/2457559/di-maria-ospina-are-leaders-in-some-key-prem-stats" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.co.uk/blog/tactic...ria-ospina-are-leaders-in-some-key-prem-stats</a>

4203~~~
His problem isn't his shot, it's that his legs seem shot. If he was more involved he would still do great. But he seems to have a lost a tad in terms of agility and running power, and that affects his ability to get involved.

I personally don't think we have place for him or falcao. Rooney as the experienced and highly paid striker is more than enough. Three of them being paid what they are right now is a bit of a dead loss.

4204~~~
I agree it is kind of ridiculous we have ended up with three big name, highly paid strikers all of whom have seen their best days come and go. Really we should probably only retain one but probably no harm in letting RVP run his contract down. A new striker is essential though this summer because we need some more pace, power and mobility up front.

4205~~~
I know it a bit random but has anyone got a gif/vine/video of when he hit the post against West Brom away when we drew 2-2, where I think he kneed it and then volleyed it. It was pretty awesome.

4206~~~
Yeah rvp will probably get to stay and finish his contract. I don't see anyone paying decent money for him now either. It would be great if he can return to his former level but I haven't seen much sign of that so its a bit of a shame that the striker position might continue to be a bit of an issue next season.

4207~~~
I'd like to see what he can do after a break this summer. I don't think he'll ever be as good as when we bought him but I do still think he can be much better than what we've seen this season. A few performances here and there (Saints away, Liverpool home and even against West Brom the other week despite missing the pen) show that all may not be lost yet.

I know I'm probably in a minority on the Caf though, most think we should just get shot of him.

Edit: I should also add it's up to Robin to sort out his attitude too because if he stops trying he really is finished at the highest level irrespective of whether his touch is still there or not.

4208~~~
Might not be here apparently next season. Supprised no one has mentioned it.

4209~~~
It's best for all parties really.

4210~~~
Interesting to see if he does go Turkey. He's still good enough to play at a higher level than that. Then again, so is Sneijder.

4211~~~
This is Louis van Gaal we are talking about, the man who doesn't always do the logical thing. Until it is confirmed I won't believe anything, that is in relation to players leaving and also players coming in. Anything really is possible.

4212~~~
Im not really sure what the best option is when it comes to RVP. On the one hand I think he could still contribute at United, but on the other hand our attack with him and Rooney is quite one dimensional, as neither are known for their pace or strength.

Wouldnt be disappointed to see him go, although I suspect LVG may want to retain him for another season rather than having to buy virtually a whole new strikeforce in one summer.

4213~~~
I think he's done at the highest level. Don't forget how many injuries he had. Look at the player he was 2011-2013, looks like the shadow of that player.

4214~~~
That may change though with Depay and Di Maria (who hopefully will come good next year) out wide. If they have faster players around them I think our attack will look much better next year.

4215~~~
If RVP is happy to play a cameo role along with Wilson - then I'd love for him to stay. His experience and persona would be fantastic to have in the dressing room. But I'm sure he'd rather finish his career playing as regularly as he can.

I adore the guy and THAT season was incredible. A joy to watch.

4216~~~
Perhaps, but I always feel that in a squad you want a variety of options from your out and out strikers, options that we didnt have this season.

I also believe that LVG values fluidity and interchanging of positions in his front three, which RVP is not exactly well suited for.

Basically I think we need to get rid of two of RVP, Falcao and Rooney - and Rooney is the obvious choice to keep (although frankly I wouldnt be fussed if we ditched him and kept RVP).

4217~~~
The only thing I'd say is if Wilson goes out on loan (which I think would be good for him) then we'll need both considering we'll be playing more games next season thanks to our league position.

4218~~~
Yeah, squad size for next year should be a consideration. Personally I think that originally part of the reason we sent Hernandez, Nani and Cleverley out on loan was so that we could potentially use them next season onwards if they had performed well on loan, whereas this year they would not be likely to get gametime.

4219~~~
Link?

4220~~~
A variety of options for his strikers is always good, he used Wilson over Falcao this season because of his speed for example. But, serious question, why do you think he wants an interchanging front 3?

As far as I'm aware he prefers a real #9, a Lewandowski or a prime RvP as they fit his striker profile. When he explained his vision to the national team and had little time to do so he showed them Barcelona, with the only addition that he didn't like Messi as their striker (pre-WC), and that he rather has a real #9. Yes the striker can end up on the wing or deeper at times, but I always thought he prefers target men. Therefore pace isn't that important for his strikers (not neglectable though), because it isn't the most important part of his striker profile.

Therefore players like Jackson Martinez, Benteke, Lewandowski, Mandzukic and even RvP on his old day will be preferred over Hernandez. The latter is gone, I just can't think of a scenario where he would stay. He doesn't fit the profile whatsoever and I thought van Gaal's comments made it clear he has no future at Manchester United.

The question is, does he trust RvP as backup for a year? He may just thrive because van Gaal's teams should work in his favor more next year. He's also undoubtebtly an important figure in the dressing room, especially for Blind and Memphis next year. This will depend on RvP himself too (does he want this?), and wether he sees Wilson as a good enough 3rd choice.

4221~~~
Bit embarrassing but I thought I remembered <i>you</i> saying it in another thread <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Must have been someone else who seemed fairly knowledgeable on LVG.

4222~~~
The striker has to be a good footballer, so they can end up out of position at times, but I'm not sure if this is their most important role given the striker profile he prefers. I know the wingers and midfielders change position alot but I'm not too sure about the striker. It could be that you're right though, hence the question.

The problem with his striker profile is that those kind of players usually don't fit his winger profile, unless he finds a new RvP or thinks Wilson can perform like that. I have absolutely no idea what he wants to do with his strikers mind, for all I know he could loan out Wilson, sell RvP and play Rooney in midfield..

4223~~~
<i>LVG UNSURE OF RVP FUTURE 

To add, Louis van Gaal refused to say whether Robin van Persiewould be at Old Trafford next year during his press conference ahead of the clash at Hull. 

"You have to wait and see. I shall not say whom I am speak to," Van Gaal said of his fellow Dutchman, who also has 12 months left on his contract.</i>

4224~~~
He either gets sold if he's willing to leave or his contract doesn't get renewed so he leaves for free next summer.

4225~~~
Apparently the Qatar clubs are after him. Never know what that does to a player at 32.

4226~~~
Farewell Robin. Cheers for league 20

4227~~~
Seems to be playing as the 10 for Holland these days.

4228~~~
Got subbed off for Wijnaldum today, who proceeded to score straight after.

4229~~~
if it's all up to us then this is certainly to retain rvp for another year despite we are going to bring in another established striker as a regular starter or to compete with everyone by the next season.  his class, skill sets, experience and a team player attitude can all help a relative young squad to develop.   this will be his last year so his salary won't be a big concern from financial point of view neither.  this is a luxury to have rvp on the bench.  just,  we can afford it for a season without any problem.  if rvp've got a good offer from somewhere else and decides to move on,  he should have received all the blessing from this football club.

4230~~~
I think he gets a 10 mil bonus when his contract runs down. Also, I can't see him have a bench role all season, especially with the Euro's coming next summer.

4231~~~
That bonus is payed in increments. 

This one I am not sure, but I think if we sell him we must pay the reminder of the bonus and if he asks to leave we don't?

4232~~~
That might just be it, not sure though.

4233~~~
Def time for him to move on.

4234~~~
Unfortunately, he has to go for everyone's sake, including his own. That's up to whoever wanting him the most to show Ed the money now.

4236~~~
I think he was hooked yesterday simply as it was a straight swap positionally and Huntelaar was doing ok as the #9, Holland were pretty poor in general.

4237~~~
He needs a good retirement club in Italy.

4238~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
One of my favourite goals in recent memory. Even so, time for him to move on I think - let that be our memory of him rather than sticking around well past his peak.

4239~~~
I personally think we can afford one more season of RVP

4240~~~
i think Van Persie's future really depends on who we can bring in....

if we can't persuade a top striker to join it would be silly to get rid

4241~~~
I Stay.

4242~~~
He still has something to give us IMO, there were games last season when his magic still shone through. He still makes the runs, he still has the technique and intelligence, it's just his legs are older then they used to be. 

There seems to be no real striker out there for us to pursue this summer, so a season more of RVP and we can reassess next summer is fine by me.

4243~~~
he thinks he will be top level at 36/37

4244~~~
Galatasary have thrown their hat in the ring.

Seems to be enjoying his holidays. Getting a tan, chilling on a boat, enjoying the company of his family, catching a shark while he's at it of course.

Don't have a clue, but it's an odd quartet... I can see why De Vrij, RVP and Blind might be mates and on holiday together but why's Pirlo tagged along <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Talking about how poor our strikers have been this season in a Mirror article.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/robin-van-persie-fearing-euro-5954376" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/robin-van-persie-fearing-euro-5954376</a>

4253~~~
RvP's consistent comments about needing to play regularly should cement that he's off IMO, we simply can't accommodate what he wants in that regard.

4254~~~

4255~~~
I love these types of stories. How on earth do they think readers will think they know what they're talking about.

4256~~~
I want LvG to keep RvP. With the midfield sorted out and Depay coming in on the wings, this team will hopefully create a lot of chances. Rvp can still bang them in when proper chances are created.

4257~~~
You monsters, look at what you have done by selling RVP
