Not to sound very clich√© but he needs to add a good bit of weight to his upper body. He would then be able to manage those shoulder to shoulder a lot better.

352~~~
I thought the ref could have given him a couple of free-kicks in that first half. Well taken goal but otherwise he needs to lose his markers a bit better.

EDIT: It also highlights why van Gaal has experimented with Memphis at #10 and why he probably don't fancy Mata there.

353~~~
Not an easy game for him with a very physical Villa midfield.Classy goal.

354~~~
good goal and good movement, but he looks weak on the ball, needs to find a way not to get thrown on his ass every time he gets teh ball.

355~~~
His touch and control in close spaces is a breath of fresh air after having endured Rooney for a while.

356~~~
Very happy for him today. Great run, great finish... Perhaps even better pass by Mata to find him in the first place.

357~~~
United's top scorer <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I'd still loan him out. I thought he was suppose to be bulking up...

Needs game time man!! If we can give him that here keep him.

359~~~
So pleased for him.

360~~~
Proved me wrong. I thought he would perform terribly in this game, especially with Villa being so physical. Great run and good goal. Pushed off the ball a couple of times, but with time he'll develop more physically and not be pushed around so much.

361~~~
He has bulked up.

He's also scored our last two goals, with a lot fewer minutes than a lot of others here.

362~~~
Not to mention this is his first competitive start after 6 months.Will only get better next game (if he does start).

363~~~
Needs to get a bit stronger but other than that I thought he was decent. Certainly better than Rooney

364~~~
Well done lad, needs more games and we will see more from him.

365~~~
Needs to pack on some more muscle, constantly bullied off the ball today. Glad that he got his goal though.

366~~~
Lvg did not sound too pleased with his overall performance though praised his goal.

Hmm almost seemed to sound like loan was a option too.

367~~~
He wasn't great but scored.

Needs games. Don't know why we played Mata wide either, Januzaj should of played on the right.

368~~~
Great goal. A bit meh apart from that sadly.

369~~~
Yeah he hasn't developed physically enough in the last two years. I think it will be his downfall. Still think he's more influential on the wing.

370~~~
I think it's very hard to be too critical of Januzaj, Mata or Memphis when they were the 3 who linked for the goal and when the striker they were trying to support doesn't have the discipline to be in the box.

They just showed the graphic and Adnan's average position was perfect for a no.10 today. The problem was the average position of his no.9 was behind him.

371~~~
Because other than the goal he was rubbish.. But like most have said. He needs game time.

He bulked up quite a lot going into last season and it looks like he's put on a few pounds again, can only help him in a Mourinho team. If everyone in our squad is playing as well as they ever have done for a decent spell in a united shirt (so not, for example basti of two years ago at bayern), absolute peak form, then januzaj wouldn't get in to the starting eleven, but as our players are so rarely at their best, and definitely not at the same time as each other I think he may have a chance this season. He is immensely talented and I have no doubts if he leaves us it will be for a champions league club, hopefully though he'll realise he needs to knuckle down, accept his place on the bench and make the most out of cameos and offer good competition for places. Would not be surprised at all if he is our equivalent of Oscar come the end of the season.

Good to see him in the gym. Although bulking up isn't his main concern right now. He needs to get his head in order for another assault on the starting XI.
