They seem to be popping up, so I thought why not start it for my man crush.

Interesting season coming up for Rafael. Like many players last year, it was one to forget but his fight and passion showed just how much it hurt him, so I expect him to bounce back.

If the move to a 3 at the back proves to be a permanent one, I do think that his quality will earn him a place over Valencia but there is no doubting he will face stiff competition from Valencia. I have always felt Rafael would excel in a 352 but he really needs to find his form from 2012/13 again. Lets hope he learns a lot off van Gaal and we continue to see him mature.

Hopefully his rest and a good, injury free pre-season sets him up nicely for the season.

2~~~
I would have Raf over Valencia as the starting wingback. If this system gets him forward a lot more than we'll get to see more gems like this one against QPR:

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3~~~
Yep, more of this please

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.minus.com/i7h0dQbrQNb9T.gif" src="http://i.minus.com/i7h0dQbrQNb9T.gif"/>

In all seriousness though, he has been around a while now but is still a young player. So hopefully van Gaal likes his energy and enthusiasm and continues to develop him.

4~~~
I'm not sure he'll be first choice. He'll play a fair bit, but so will Valencia - assuming Van Gaal's going for 3-5-2.

5~~~
I think Valencia's defensive awareness will place him below Rafael. Valencia is obviously one hell of an athlete though (not that Rafa isn't) and that is a big tick in the box for a wingback.

Hopefully a good battle between the two and it gets the best out of them.

In saying that, van Gaal will adapt to every situation, so there are going to be plenty of times we see a flat 4 at the back and Rafael has proven that he is a far better RB than Valencia.

6~~~
Should be first choice and I'm convinced he will show LVG that. Gonna be a great season for him, I know it!

7~~~
Has to finally have an injury free season. But it's a huge risk not to,have a Rb alternative.

8~~~
I actually reckon he'll mature an awful lot more under Luis. LVG will look to keep the energy in his game while making him less hot-headed. If he does that, I reckon that Rafael will go from strength to strength and possibly maintain that right back spot for years to come.

9~~~
Valencia isn't an option as a RB or RWB IMO. He is such a liability there. Any time Moyes put him at RB last season he seemed to be at fault for a goal (Everton and Spurs at home immediately spring to mind).

10~~~
Juventus bought Asamoah as a CM and have him playing on the left of a 3 back formation. He's done well there as well. If he can do it, Valencia can too. It's like a mix between RM and RB, we know he isn't the greatest in either position, so maybe a wingback role will suit him better.

11~~~
I don't see why Asamoah being able to do it has anything at all do with Valencia ability to play in the position.

12~~~
Well Valencia playing on the right hand side for most of his career would help him transition easier. I used Asamoah as an example as he transitioned there from a position which is a lot different. Valencia has the attributes, I don't see why he cant play there.

13~~~
Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't Asamoah a CDM who also occasionally played wide on the left? As a result he would have been used to having defensive responsibility and also experienced playing on the wing. While Valencia would have no problem with playing wide he doesn't have the most important attribute of all, that being defensive awareness. He got caught out a number of times last season when playing at RB and I would hate to see him played there or RWB.

14~~~
Rafael vs Valencia for right wing back, with wild cards Janko and Varela.  Let battle commence.

15~~~
Him being picked at RB/RWB by three managers suggests he can offer something there. He has switched off at RB before but van Gaal coming in and agreeing (or insisting) on Valencia being offered a new contract suggest he feels he can also be a good WB. Valencia will also have cover from the third CB and the DM I guess.

16~~~
SAF didn't use him as a RB that often at all. Moyes picking him as a RB sort of backs up my argument that he isn't up to it! <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/> LVG only played him there in one friendly. He played James at LWB but doubt we will see much of him once the season starts. 

Besides I'm not convinced we will be playing with a back 3 once the season starts. LVG is just trying out different options at the minute but I can see us predominantly using an orthodox back 4 once the season starts.

17~~~
Hopefully he can have an injury-free season. If he does that then I'm pretty confident he can find his best form.

18~~~
I thought van Gaal confirmed we will be using 3 at the back this season?

19~~~
Did he? I thought he said it was one formation he was trying out during pre-season but it wasn't necessarily the formation he intended using this season. He would have used 433 with the Netherlands at the WC (they used it throughout qualifying) but Strootmans injury forced a rethink. He also used 433 at Bayern.

20~~~
After the game I think he did an interview saying he'd be using 3 at the back this season.

21~~~
I say some article saying that he said something along those lines but when I read it I didn't get that impression at all. I really hope we don't go with 3 at the back tbh.

22~~~
If we're not playing with a traditional RB this season then it's not an issue. Rafa and Valencia for the RWB spot.

23~~~
Oh and van Gaal has confirmed we'll be using 3 at the back this coming season.

24~~~
Obviously Rafael is clearly the better defender out of the two and I still rate him going forward higher than Valencia has shown recently. I think he will do really well under LVG and we will see that last season was just a blip, like for many of the players. Was also one of a few players that actually played like they cared still last season as well. Big season for Rafael!

25~~~
Rafael was born to be a wingback.

26~~~
S**t! Not a fan of a back 3 at all. Very surprised he won't be playing with out and out wingers.

27~~~
We haven't got any that are really up to it so not much of a surprise at all. Also, as he said we have a lot of #10s so that's influenced his thinking.

28~~~
In 352 I prefer Valencia. Valencia has a better stamina and hard working which make this formation better for him than Rafael. When we are attacking it's probably will be 343. When we are defending it will be 532. Rafael passing seems worse since last season even during the pre season against LA. This is why I'm guessing Valencia would be a favour choice.
But I'm 100% LVG is trying his best to make our team to be suitable in 433 system by signing some players. Rafael is more suitable for this one.

29~~~
But Valencia is much worse defensively. Rafael would be a clear first choice if it was up to me but we'll have to see what happens.

30~~~
The wing back in 352 or 343 is more advanced than defensive. But then you need to be more discipline, not lazy to help the defense and this is why LVG pick Kuyt for this role.

31~~~
No one would call Valencia lazy I think, but his defensive instincts are far behind Rafael's (as he's shown time and again when we plugged him in at RB). 
Either way, barring a few more acquisitions in the transfer market, it would almost certainly be a time share between the two in the 3-5-2 formation.

32~~~
I agree we have very few quality wingers at the moment but he has plenty of money to go out and buy them. Sanchez was available for just over £30 million and is a world class winger. I doubt he is attainable but we should offer £40+ million to Dortmund for Reus and see if we have any luck. Also although it isn't his best position Januzaj is a decent winger in his own right.

33~~~
But then what does he do with all of his #10s? It was never realistic especially considering money is needed elsewhere also. The only way he could do it is by playing players out of position.

34~~~
He really needs to cut down his impulsiveness to commit silly errors and petulance on the pitch. I'd be surprised if none of the senior players have taken him aside and explained how not to get on the wrong side of the referee and get booked so often. He shows a lack of maturity with advancing years.

35~~~
Kagawa should be sold. Could probably get between £10-15 million for him. Given all the number 10's we have there is no need for him. That would leave us with Rooney, Mata and Januzaj as our number 10's with the latter two capable of filling in out wide. To be honest if an offer of £40+ came in from the likes of PSG or Chelsea for Rooney I would be very tempted to take it. Mata is the better number 10 (with RVP the better number 9) and Januzaj is the future in that position. Probably in the minority with that opinion but it's just that, my opinion.

36~~~
I hope he stays injury free and gets back to being a solid defender. He was very dodgy last season, not much different to his first season.

The new wingback system should hopefully see him improve in attack as well. He doesn't seem to have as much about him going forward as when he first arrived for whatever reason.

37~~~
We actually only have two number 10s, I don't understand the assumption that we have an abundance of players there. Rooney is not <i>naturally</i> a 10. He is a striker, pure and simple. Januzaj is nowhere near ready to be a 10 at a major team yet. He's good on the wing, for now.

I'm not even going to count Fellaini, for obvious reasons.

38~~~
Perhaps, but that circles back to a previous point. The fact that Van Gaal has said he wants to get to know his players on this tour. It comes as no surprise to me that we haven't seen this mass exodus everyone else seemed to be expecting.

39~~~
Van Gaal says we have 4. Van Gaal > TooBias

Kagawa, Mata and Januzaj are all #10s. I don't like Rooney there but that's where he's played his entire career so it's not exactly unusual for him to be described as a #10.

40~~~
Love that goal, reminds me of the whiteside one.

Out of interest do you think he could cover lb? Just thought he might because of fabio.

41~~~
Doesn't matter if he is a first choice or not. Unless he has an injury free season that's really a moot point.

42~~~
As Carl pointed out Rooney has spent most of his career playing as a number 10 therefore that would suggest that it is his natural position. Januzaj is a number 10. Whether he is ready to play in that position for us is another matter (personally I would be comfortable with him filling in there but want Mata as our first choice in that position for now) but he is a better number 10 than a winger.

43~~~
As another poster said, it's possible van Gaal meant 10s to be strikers - because it was in the context of playing only one striker in a 433 - of which we definitely have 4. I doubt van Gaal even considers Fellaini a footballer, let alone a 10.

44~~~
This is a good point and very possible. Regardless, I think it's silly to try and read loads of detail into those comments, because his English is too rusty for us to be able to say confidently exactly what he meant. The overall point - that he's playing the 352 because our squad is forward-heavy and he wants to be able to play more of them - is the only one really worth paying attention to.

45~~~
Think it's almost definitely with regards to the strikers, because the other comments he said was that he can't have 3 of them on the bench if he used a 4-3-3 so this way he has 2 starting. So yeah, it's strikers I think. We're overstocked with both IMO but he does have a point, and I don't think he sees Rooney as a winger/#10/midfielder, but a striker like he should be IMO.

46~~~
I don't think van Gaal will have him down as an option there but I'm sure in an emergency, if he is on the pitch, he will go over there before any midfielder or other defender.

47~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

48~~~
Ffs... At a time where he needs to be fit and fight for his place as he won't be a guaranteed starter when fit as a wing back IMO. Hope its nothing serious.

49~~~
He picks up these strains and niggling injuries a lot and it could really hinder him if it carries on.

50~~~
I'll fly over and give him a rub.

51~~~
This is getting ridiculous now, wasted potential and to think how good he would be if he wasn't constantly injured.

52~~~
I think it's way too harsh and soon to call him a waste of potential. He has been great for us and developed well over the years. Not every footballer has a dream run of injuries. All we have to go by is a tweet saying he limped off. Have to wait and see if it's serious or not.

53~~~
Oh ffs, this will just mean more of Valencia <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

54~~~
Firstly - Who said it matters? Does it have to 'matter' for me to type about it? Half the stuff posted on here doesn't really matter.

Secondly - People are debating whether he'll play regularly ahead of Valencia. As the default option, so to speak.
Doesn't that concern him being first choice? Yes it does, and personally, I don't think he'll play regularly with Valencia as his understudy. If we don't bring in a player specifically for the wing-back role, then Valencia's as suited (if not more suited) to play there, in my opinion.

I'm not really sure how that's a moot point.

55~~~
This is why Smalling and Jones spent their time as a right back.

56~~~
It's a moot point because if he gets injured all the time he will not get enough time to build up the momentum to become a first choice. Even if LVG likes him more he would be forced to use Valencia most of the time. There were reports that he got injured again in training... Hence I think Rafael shouldn't worry about competition from Valencia so much - the most important thing for him is to stay injury free.

57~~~
We seriously need to get a right back. And I'm not sure whether it has to be a 'back up' or a first-team starter. Rafael's injury record is absolutely ridiculous and it doesn't seem to stop.

58~~~
Gutted for him. He seemed eager to impress when he came on and was doing too much. Now he gets injured <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> I hope it's not serious and he recovers before the season kicks off.

59~~~
Jesus, so much for that. He's made of twigs and rubber bands.  We absolutely need a new RB. Can't stand the idea of Valencia or one of the CBs filling in for another season.

60~~~
I hope it's nothing. Maybe it's just a little strain which will keep him out for just a week. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

61~~~
Such a surprise that he's injured again.. I hope that LvG will go with Valencia as his wing back - I love Rafael but we cant rely on him being fit enough of the time.

62~~~
So frustrating with this latest injury but it is pre season so hopefully it is only a minor strain and he will be fit for first game of the season.

63~~~
Time to throw big money at Everton for Coleman.

64~~~
Further evidence, if any were needed, that the issue of the quality of our defenders is secondary to their being able to stay fit for any length of time. Rafael, Evans, Smalling and Jones all have a season ticket for the sick room. We need robust defensive recruits pronto.

65~~~
Does Janko even play RB for the reserves?

66~~~
I love Rafael, but he needs to go and we need to replace him with someone that can hold up for any length of games/

67~~~
Time to go in for Coleman

68~~~
Not really anyone 'available' who's better suited to right wing back than Coleman. At least that I can think of. I'd be really happy with him coming here.
Not going to happen though.

69~~~
Ronny Johnsen Mk. II.

70~~~
Bit soon saying he needs to go. Yeah, this is annoying and it's arguable we could do with another right-back, but the guy was excellent a couple of seasons back and does clearly have some quality. If he is able to stay fit after this injury, I'm hopeful he could maybe find some of his better form again. If we're talking in the same position in a year though, you may have a point, although hopefully that won't be the case.

71~~~
Our defenders are made of glass. I don't trust any of them to stay fit.

72~~~
I think he's a great player, but this is getting ridiculous now. The bloke cannot stay fit.

We need a settled defense, especially with a new system of play and I struggle to see how we will achieve that.

73~~~
Rafael. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

74~~~
I love Rafael, but we need a right back. He's proven he can't be trusted to stay fit. I'd of loved us to have been in for Chambers at Southampton. Perhaps look at Coleman. 

It's no use having him first choice only to go off injured and have to rely on Jones or Smalling, neither of whom are that great at right back.

75~~~
Calm down girls, it's a little groin strain. No need to start throwing yourselves off balconies just yet.

We need reliable back-up. But once we have that, there's nothing wrong with Rafa as first choice. Personally I'd be fine with promoting Varela, he's very defensively reliable.

76~~~
Until the next 2-3 month injury after this one and then another 1-2 month set back after that.

The guy is constantly injured. IMO he's one of the best when he's fit but keeping him fit is the problem.

77~~~
He plays right midfield which is close to the role Valencia and Rafael played in the first pre-season game on the side of a 5 man midfield. He has played right back for us, just very little and he was a right back before he came to the club its just we tried to fit both him and Varela into the team.

He's a Valencia with proper training to play right back and arguably less reliant on pace to beat a man. I'd give him an edge on dribbling over Valencia, with not as much speed but still plenty enough for the role.

78~~~
As long as he's not 'peg leg' then all is swell.

79~~~
A swap with Fellaini

80~~~
Some of you lot need to calm down.

81~~~
Problem is that Raf seems to constantly be getting these "little" injuries.

82~~~
Groin strains are a bitch. Depends on the severity of course but they're always tougher to heal. Could be a few weeks which will totally ruin his pre-season. That's why girls are not calm.

83~~~
He is tiny and lightweight, grew up in some favelas eating outdated food

I wouldn't be surprised if he is injury prone

84~~~
Love the lad but can't stop feeling a bit discouraged by yet another injury.

85~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

86~~~
Rafael back in Manchester for treatment on groin injury

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Jul/rafael-returns-home-from-tour-2014-for-treatment-on-injury.aspx?newsid=D02FDFFF-A75F-43F2-9693-9565309E561E&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...61E&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter</a>

87~~~
Every year.. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

88~~~
Really disappointing. Not exactly surprising though. The time is coming where we have to make a decision on him.

89~~~
I want Varela to be given a chance. He has potential to be better than Rafael

90~~~
oh my god <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

91~~~
It has come to point where injuries can really destroy his career. He is more on a treatment table than on the  pitch.

Whats up with Varela btw is he even on tour?

92~~~
We really need to sign a first choice right back. Rafael can never stay fit.

93~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

94~~~
You jinxed him

95~~~
Not great news. Really hope after this he can avoid getting injured for the rest of the season, as him being on the treatment table so often can't be helping his development.

96~~~
If it's a little strain then that's fine. Rooney's another player that seems to pick up knocks all the time during the season, but as long as he's out for short periods of time it doesn't really matter that much. If he's out for a while though, then yeah a trend is developing and we probably should look to replace him. Which is a shame, I think he's a great right back, figured he'd tie that position down for years to come.

97~~~
You would think a lot of fans are about ready to throw Rafa under a bus because of his injuries.

98~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

He's too injury prone, definitely need another RB to replace him as the starter.

99~~~
There's a time for sentiment and a time for realising that his injury record is severely impacting on our performances on the pitch. He's not going to reach a point soon where he can stay injury free for a consistent run. It's a shame because I think a wing-back role would suit him well.

100~~~
No doubt that there is no room for sentiment. We need our best players fit and ready to go. However, injuries are part of the game and sometimes can't be avoided. A reality that fans don't want to accept, they need to blame someone, that's just natural. I would much prefer Rafael (and any player) to get over these injuries but I'm sure he and the medical team do their absolute best to try and resolve them. I'm not going to hide from the fact that he is a favourite of mine so I will naturally stand by him but I think he needs the support and I'm sure he will be fit soon. If that's blind optimism, so be it but even with that, I do understand the need to always look to improve but in my opinion, I can't think of any RB we could bring in that would be an upgrade on Rafael.

By the way, do you have any proof that he isn't going to reach a point where he can stay injury free? A lot of players are injury prone and then get over them.

101~~~
Surprise surprise. Rafa out again. Getting beyond a joke now.

Just a matter of time before his other sicknote mates, Jones, Smalling and Evans join him.

102~~~
Judging by some of the comments you would think Rafael, among others in the squad, enjoy getting injuries. Believe me, he'll be a lot more pissed off than some of the whoppers in here. These guys have my sympathy more so than anything else, I don't care however much they earn.

103~~~
A shame Janko or Varela aren't on the tour.......i've said in another thread that Rafael will get a injury on the tour

104~~~
No one is saying that, but I care mainly about United and therefore think it's getting to a point for a lot of us, where we should look at a replacement.

105~~~
I wouldn't be against bringing in a legit right back, and let rafa fight for the spot for a few years. He has had virtually no competition for the spot and although he has been exceptional at times, i feel he needs a little push. It also gives up ample cover for his injury niggles, which he can hopefully wriggle out off over the comming years. Top player when his confidence is up.

106~~~
He should be. LVG still looks at Smalling and Valencia as his RB backups which is depressing. I know its only because he's been told that but once he sees how talented Varela is someone is getting fired for giving wrong information. Varela is 21 years old. To me he's a better defender than Rafael and he needs a chance.

107~~~
Given that we don't play full backs any more, I doubt if Smalling is seen to be his backup. That seems to be Valencia or Young currently. Maybe Varela will get a look in when we get back from the tour.

108~~~
I'm guessing no new update with him atm? Gutted he has got another little niggly injury. Hope he gets fit for the start of the season at least.

109~~~
He better start doing yoga with Giggs.

110~~~
No updates for this bump, but I am just curious to know if the lad as suffered a nasty injury in the past year or two that I'm not aware of?  He seems to have dropped off the radar both for the media and fans.  I've noticed that in many people's mock lineups, they'd rather have Valencia or Young in his position, or even Cuardado.  I refuse to believe that one bad season under a mediocre manager could ruin a player.  When rumors first started about LVG's new system of playing 3 at the back with wingbacks to support, my first thought was that Rafael's name should be first on the teamsheet.  He and his twin brother were natural wingbacks even before they signed for us.  LVG's wingbacks would surely suit him as it gives him the freedom to bomb forward while the three centerbacks give him enough cover in case he doesn't track back quick enough.

I really hope we're not planning to offload him because I still have high hopes for him.  He's still prone to the occasional brain fart and rash tackle, but that's probably part of his Brazilian DNA.  His attacking prowess is far too valuable to overlook.  I think he's going to have a great season with Van Gaal, providing lots of assists and even bang in a couple of screamers which he's more than capable of.

111~~~
It's Cuadrado.

Agree with the post though. Love him and still believe that he would become a key player for us.

112~~~
He is still fairly young (24) but to be honest he has had only 1 season where he was consistently good. Lets not also forget he has only one season where he made 30+ appearances for the first team and one season where he made 20+ appearances in the EPL which is pretty poor for a full back. He has all the attributes required to become a top notch wing back and hope he has another season like the 12/13 one.

113~~~
He'll never be a key player when he gets injured every time it looks like he's going on a decent run of games.

114~~~
Aren't we buying blind to cover the lb/DM?

115~~~
Big season for the wee man, he has all the attributes needed to play the wingback role well. Let's hope he stays fit and Van Gaal delevops him as I think he will.

116~~~
He was a key player for us in the last Fergie's season. And, probably, third best performer. And look at Van Persie, for example, and his injury record in Arsenal. He didn't become a key player for us and Arsenal?
Stop with the cliches.

117~~~
Agree, excited to see him in a more offensive role. Hopefully he can weigh in with a fair few goals and assists.

118~~~
Most people on this forum I would guess and this includes myself, like Rafa and think he has a place in the first team.
You can't get away from the fact that he is injury prone and can't seem to get a big run of consecutive matches under his belt.

I hate for us to have stand-ins like Valencia, Smalling or Jones playing RB/RWB threw out the up coming season.
I'd sooner we have a proper RB/RWB stand-in.

119~~~
Ah yes, I think I've heard this one before. <i>This season </i>is the one where he doesn't get injured and leave us relying on a dodgy backup. 

What, he's injured already?

120~~~
It's not like he never had a full season - he had, just the season before, actually. And he was brilliant. So it wasn't really a bizarre statement that he can be a regular starter and very important player for us, like he was the last time we won the league.

You're talking like I'm the Liverpool fan waiting for the next year to be our year, despite not winning the league for decades. My league "was won" not so long ago and there are a lot of players who left their injury problems aside with age, Van Persie or Robben, for example.

121~~~
He got hurt on the US tour. I do think we need someone to compete with him and Valencia for that RWB spot. Not a dodgy backup sort but the kind that could start even. I love Raf but the fact that hes injured half the time does not serve him or the club.

122~~~
We can't just cross our fingers and hope though that this season will be an injury free one for him, <b>especially given that he's already fecking injured</b>!. Valencia playing in his place is a sub rate solution, let alone having a CB play in his place.

123~~~
On pure ability one of our best players and one of the best right backs in the league. For the love of god stay fit we need you.

124~~~
<b>Van Gaal:</b> I have to say with a huge amount of regret that we're letting you go Rafael

<b>Rafael:</b> Wow, really? Are you about sign a new right back?
<b>
Van Gaal:</b> No, but i just prefer Ashley Young in your position, no offense

<b>Rafael:</b>

125~~~
This will be LVG's first massive cock up if he really does sell Rafael. I personally can't see it though, unless he feels Rafael is not good enough as a wingback but he saw him for what 1 and a half games?.

I hope they have this part wrong.

126~~~
Won't happen. It's not like we are stocked in that position. He may prefer Valencia as a right wing back for now but we have injuries all too often and what happens it the 3-5-2 becomes ineffective at some point in the season? We'd have to change it up and probably go with a back 4 and he'd be the only choice.

127~~~
I love him. He's still a bit short of required concentration levels and his injuries are concerning to say the least. But he's one of the last players I'd let go

128~~~
I'd be really pissed if he is let go.

Anyway, not believing that.

129~~~
Rafael going but Valencia staying would actually be beyond belief. Unbelievable if true.

130~~~
I'm not necessarily against selling Rafael, but not until we have a replacement who is better than him. We don't at the moment. He should not be sold at the moment. He's only just 24 and he's shown enough to stay another season - it's not like our squad is full and we can't afford the wages.

131~~~
Is he really going to complain about the balance of our squad then sell our only Right Back after watching him for like a game and a bit?

132~~~
We'll end up playing a back four at some point and he's our only proper RB. It would be utter madness. Not to mention the fact I like having him around.

133~~~
I probably wouldn't sell him just yet. I don't think he'll get much game time this season though.

134~~~
Who will in his position? Valencia? Young? Or do you think we'll be buying Cuadrado?

135~~~
I think both Valencia and Young are currently ahead of him in the pecking order for right wing-back, all this could change throughout the season but he'd have to remain fit first...

136~~~
There's no evidence to suggest that they are ahead.

Well yeah they will be when he's injured. Anyway, if his injury issues is that much of a factor then let's sell Evans, Jones, Smalling as well.

137~~~
He's my favourite player and should be a key part of this squad and one of those we should be building around for the future.

138~~~
Yes there is, pre-season.

139~~~
He should be a key player but his injury record is horrendous. We just can't rely on him anymore.

140~~~
Valencia played 45 minutes of the Galaxy game and Rafael played 45 minutes IIRC.

Then he picked up a Injury.

141~~~
If he's letting him go, there must be a replacement coming in...

142~~~
As I said in the other thread I'd be open to selling him for a decent fee. He's far too unreliable in terms of injuries and play. He hasn't matured the way he should've IMO.

He's played 6 seasons with us and has only once made 40 appearances. His next highest tally is 28 and that's mainly been down to injuries.

143~~~
That article is a bunch of shit. He's defensively sound, moreso than both Young and Valencia put together, and he offers more in attack than Valencia and maybe Young... 

He definitely will not be sold unless we have a guaranteed replacement lined up.

144~~~
As usual.

145~~~
We're not selling Rafael. It would be madness on more than one level.

146~~~
FFS, he was looking mature and generally very good in SAF's final season and then errm the Moyes era happened.

147~~~
So did Smalling later as usual.

All our back defensive options except Shaw have issues with injuries.

148~~~
I'm not fussed if he does go, slowly becoming another Anderson/Nani living off his so called potential

149~~~
I'm not his biggest fan...but to sell him instead of Valencia would be crazy

150~~~
Rafael is a popular player among our fans, so I can understand the concern. I've said it before but he is overrated on here, I don't think he'd get much game time for other elite European clubs. His injury record is poor and he is still capable of a brain fart or two. I like him, and would keep him but we should definitely be in the market for an upgrade. If van Gaal feels more comfortable with Valencia and Young at wing-back then so be it, I trust his judgement.

151~~~
People have short memories man.

152~~~
Valencia is a big beast who rarely gets injured compared to Rafael. I can see why that would be attractive if Van Gaal wants a tight squad. 

But anyway, I don't trust this story. I can't see sales of players like Rafael until replacements are signed.

153~~~
Yeah but SAF's final season was a bit of an anomaly for Rafael in terms of injuries. Last season was far more indicative of what we've seen in the past from him.

He made 40 appearances in SAF's last season. His next best is 28. For a guy who's been here for 6 years and is generally considered a starting rightback that is really poor.

154~~~
Hes in our top 5-6 players imo. Would be incredibly stupid to get rid.

155~~~
Moyes was fecking dinosaur so it was no surprise Rafael was injured more often, he looked like he was getting it together in 2012-13, deserves another year at least if Valencia, Cleverley and Young get another chance.

156~~~
There's no way Valencia or Young would get picked ahead off a super fit Rafael on the right. Not in a 3-5-2, not in a 4-3-3, just no way.

157~~~
Clinging to Rafael's great season could be similar to clinging to Valencia's great season...

158~~~
No it wouldn't Rafael's always generally been good. His issues have been discipline and injuries and in 2012-13 he looked like he had it sorted. The lad can actually play and he's suited for this formation.

159~~~
Tbf, Rafa hasn't shown such any considerable drop in talent ala Valencia, if anything he's consistently got better. Its just his injury record is so appalling that its gone from being a bit of a worry to a major concern.

160~~~
Yeah except for the fact Rafael actually knows what he's doing when he's got the ball on his feet and has ten times more potential than Nani or Valencia. Seriously I'm not even gonna read this thread anymore, biggest nonsense ever. And if we somehow sell Rafael... nah there's just no way Van Gaal would be so stupid. Unless PSG or Barca or Real are offering insane money for him and Rafael himself wants out.

161~~~
A super fit Rafael does not exist ...try to stick to real players

162~~~
Well it doesn't help his reputation that the first thing Rafa did under Van Gaal was get injured after 45 mins of preseason football.

163~~~
I like him as a player but he's definitely replaceable so I would not be outraged like others should we sell him.

164~~~
Why? Valencia is only playing because Rafael's injured.

165~~~
How do you know that?

166~~~
I just feel at face value - he doesn't have the discipline game to play a full wingback role. Before the flamethrowers come out - I love the little guy and would have him at right back in a 4 at the back scenario. I have to say that I think this has a lot to do with it. If it is true - of course. Loves the club which is why he gets a lot of respect.

167~~~
Rafael isn't disciplined for 3-4-1-2? SAF trusted him in a back 4 and this formation has an extra CB covering what is everyone on about, he should thrive in this system.

168~~~
Didn't he start the first game and got injured? 

What's he done anyway, his groin? He never seems to get a niggle and miss a game it's just 6 weeks out straight away.

169~~~
Valencia started the first game, Rafael came on at half-time.

170~~~
I can't see the club selling him, at least not yet.

Personally I think Rafael, Shaw, James, Young and Valencia is enough for the wing back roles with Rafael and Shaw as starters.  Young has been a revelation in pre-season and I think Valencia, Rafael, Shaw and James can all play the role.  There's also enough flexibility in the squad to change to a flat back four if needed.

If Rafael has another injury disrupted season then letting him go makes a lot of sense.  Can't see it at the moment with the club needing another centre back and central midfielder.

171~~~
feck right off.

172~~~
3 weeks until the close of a the window, is there a club out there prepared to buy an injured RB? Im not so sure.

173~~~
If he is being sold it means Cuadrado is going to come in. TBH I would rather we sell Valenca and keep Rafael. He is just 24 ffs and has shown so much promise and ability. The contract we gave Valencia could end up like the one we gave to Nani last season. Undeserved and Valencia has shown nothing at RB to justify a place ahead of Rafael in the squad. Valencia is defensively suspect with his concentration and positioning being below-par. He has good workrate and is physical but those qualities alone do not make a good wing-back. The only possible reason I can think of letting Rafael leave would be his injury proneness.

174~~~
Arsenal just squeezed £15m out of Barca for an older, more injury prone Vermaelen so it's possible. 

That would leave us with Shaw as our only real full back. Not clever.

175~~~
I'd be sad to see him go (as long as it's part of a massive overhaul with plenty of cover coming in) as it signifies that we have a plan and an end game. Some times good players can't be part of a future strategy.

176~~~
I think we can all be quite sure that PSG, Barca and Real won't be breaking the door down offering insane money for him. So on that point you can be relieved.

Although I'm laughing that anyone has had the thought that those clubs would be so desperate to buy him. If they went for him it would be as a cheap punt. Seems like some serious overrating of him to think otherwise. If he wasn't so injury prone it would be very very different. But injuries have stopped all kinds of player from potentially being top class.

177~~~
I don't think we will sell him nor do I want us to sell him but I laugh at how people on here acted as if he was clearly better than Coleman.

178~~~
I don't think Coleman is any better as a football player, but Coleman is not made of balsa wood, and that's an important talent in the PL.

179~~~
Don't even think about it Louis, you have done so good since you have been here.

180~~~
Injuries are mounting up for such a relatively young lad.

181~~~
That's just silly. Coleman had the season of his life (admittedly he was excellent, but let him prove that he can do it again before we start acting like he is Cafu) in 13/14 whereas it was probably Rafael's worst year in his first team career so far. The season before (12/13), Rafael was miles ahead of every other full-back in the league bar Zabaleta (who was better defensively, but not as good going forward. Zabaleta still the better player that year, but marginally). In the seasons before that, Rafael was regularly impressive, if very erratic, while also full of promise including a very good 09/10 season at a young age. 

Coleman, who is a year older, was not really hot property by any means until this season. He showed potential and his regular watchers knew he could turn into a very good player, but if Rafael was fit as a fiddle throughout his career (a big if, true), there would be clear daylight between them. Rafael is much more talented. It's a shame about his injuries.

Fair enough if you think Coleman is a superior player (to me, he was only better in 13/14) but Rafael has done more, so far, in less time. He is a very good and all, but let's wait until he keeps Bale & Ribery quiet, or sustains his form for over a year.

182~~~
Honestly wouldn't be bothered if he left if we signed a decent replacement first. Ridiculously injury prone and still very rash and impulsive at times.

183~~~
Strange article on Daily Mail. Can't see us letting him go - and not only because I love him to bits. He is our only right back that is capable of playing in four man defense, which Van Gaal definitely prefers (he is talking a lot about 4-3-3 and how he would've play it with us if only he had enough quality on the wings, most recently - the Ronaldo/Di Maria interview). Even if we sign Cuadrado he isn't a full-back - he is probably better for a wing-back role but that isn't long-term plan for Van Gaal.

And, again, LVG talks consistently about our squad's misbalance, about how he want to sign players for the positions where we lack quality etc. To sell one of the decent performers on a very problematic position looks like a last thing that he would do right now (if we believe in what he says though, but why shouldn't we?)

184~~~
This was my initial thought. If something wasn't working with the 3-5-2 and you wanted to shift back to 4 in defence it wouldn't be the best idea to play Valencia at RB as he has been caught out many times there.

185~~~
Can't believe some people actually buy into dailymail article. LvG would pick  Valencia who have been consistently shite over Rafael? Yes sure, he's injury prone but our boss isn't going to kick him out just like that,  Cleverly has been given  proper chance to prove, why not Rafa? That isn't something LvG would do. Sorry but I don't believe it for a second.

186~~~
I think it's all rubbish personally. I wouldn't buy into anything The Daily Fail spouts out. Even the positives.

Even if Rafael isn't a regular starter, I suspect LVG will keep him around as he and Shaw are our only real full backs and they're always useful if he wants to play a traditional back four. I expect Van Gaal to keep everyone except maybe Nani and Anderson. Not because Nani is the worst player or anything, but a lot of clubs want him and perhaps it might be time for him to move on.

187~~~
Just see so many more reasons to keep him than sell, especially when you consider who would still remain. Can't see us signing any other true RB so really hoping we keep him until the winter window at least. He's done more to deserve a chance to prove his fitness and ability than Cleverley or Valencia imo. 

And honestly, how can you not love the little bastard? Cut from the same cloth as Evra imo

188~~~
Great player and very underrated here on the caf, its just an awful pity he's made of glass.

189~~~
Underrated? I'd say he is massively overrated on here.

But would be strange letting go of a entire back four and only signing Shaw.

190~~~
Why the feck would we sell Rafael now? Daily mail have made up some utter dreck this summer, more than usual this window. We may as well throw out De Gea and Shaw, makes as much sense. Rafa is quality when he's fit, he was instrumental in helping us win our last league. He definitely has been picking up more injuries of late. I'm sure David Moyes rehabilitation plan of more laps to combat injury didn't help last season. Rafa offers more on the wing than Valencia has in 2 years. If he somebody good to link up with I'm sure he would get more assist's/goals. I highly doubt he will be leaving when we have so much to sort out already. Can't wait to the season starts so we got concentrate on the football on the pitch instead of nonsense of it

191~~~
I'll be disappointed to see him leave. I still believe on his day he's one of the best full backs in Europe. I'm pretty sure he's still improving as well.

Seems an odd player to be sold.

192~~~
Vermealen isnt injured at this minute tho? Clubs dont generally buy players who are currently injured.

193~~~
Doubt it.. 

Quite a few in the squad that need to be shown the door before Rafa. We could upgrade on him of course but that's down the list of prioritys. 

Was excellent in the last title winning season, injured at the moment and hopefully he's back soon. First choice down the right when fully fit.

194~~~
you would think that he is ideally suited to being a wingback, still injured all the time though

195~~~
I think he said he played as a wingback back in Brazil before coming to United.

196~~~
I don’t like the idea of selling him. For me he is easily our best RB and I’d expect him to perform at RWB as well. Yes he is injury prone, but at the moment he is our only actual RB. It just doesn’t seem smart selling him when it would basically leave us with only Valencia and young for the RWB spot, and if we do go back to a flat four we will be stuck with either Valencia or one of our CB plugged into the role. It really would be disappointing if we sell him, so hopefully there are nothing to these rumours.

197~~~
I hope its not true.....us selling him I mean. Rafael would be perfect in the wingback role.

198~~~
make no sense selling our only natural right back.  i know we are playing with 2 wingbacks now but we could well return to 4-3-3 soon and rafael should be able to contribute in a 3-5-2 formation as well. hope this is not true at all.

we all know the only problem with rafael are his injuries. apart from that he has been great for us.

199~~~
One of the only reasons I'd be against the move would be as stated above he's our only natural RB if we need to play 433, the fawning over the player by some United fan's I do find odd though, hes consistently rash but whats worse is his staggeringly awful injury record, even when fit to start so often he needs to be subbed prior the 70minute mark, what good is a player who never plays?

200~~~
I agree that there would be almost no benefits to be gained by selling him this summer, even if we were getting in someone else in his position.

But theres a chance well be on here saying the same things about him this time next year. I don't rate him as highly as many others here do, and I think he can be upgraded on, but its not something that needs doing immediately whilethere are more pressing concerns and uncertainties about what system we'll be using going forward.

Next summer we'll have a clearer idea of the system and general plans, and it's then that it will make sense to look to replace him more long term, if need be.

201~~~
I agree. 

I wouldn't want him sold this summer as it's not a issue that needs addressing. But I don't think he's as great as some people make him out to be.

202~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

203~~~
Finally a manager who understands that he is not good enough, it was clear to me since 5 yrs.

204~~~
A mistake to sell

205~~~
You and me, carpark now!

206~~~
Daily mail, they probably just wanted to round up to five and noticed he'd not played much preseason.

You don't sell a player with the kind of spirit this lad has. It would have to be a hell of an upgrade

207~~~
So we are believing DailyFail now?

208~~~
Wouldn't want him to be sold, but we definitely need a right back - if not this summer (Cuadrado?), then next one.

We're talking about 24yr old footballer, who managed to stay fit for ONE season, where he played 40 games overall, which isn't something astonishing.
In other seasons he didn't managed to exceed 30 games overall and never played more than 20 league games (except that one season from above).
Evra played ~50 games a season for a bloody while, that's what you'd expect from a top defender you can rely on.

He's a likeable chap, but come on - if you don't stay fit, you won't make it at this level.

209~~~
Not a great fan of Rafael meself.  At least, 50/50 on whether the positives - ability on the ball, heart etc, outweigh the negatives.

However, if this is true - which I don't think it is.  LVG has very quickly decided that the decision-making/defensive problems can't be gotten over because the kid is a bit brainless & too impulsive - which might be accurate but still looks hasty.  And doesn't seem entirely fair.  But it's football, innit.

210~~~
People keep saying he injury prone but then are we selling Evans, Jones and Smalling as well ?

LVG said he'll tell players how much game time they'll get etc.. so doubt he has told anyone he needs to leave anyway except the real obvious ones like say a Anderson etc..

I don't see Rafael leaving even if he is first choice backup in a season. Don't get why we would force him out. It would be just stupid.

211~~~
Absolute rubbish. He's not without his faults but he's had some special moments in a utd shirt. It's the amount of injuries is my concern. The impulsive and rash challenges have improved 'year on year'.

212~~~
How quickly people forget how important he was for us 2 seasons ago. We know he didn't have the best season last year (who did?!) and he has his injuries issues, but still only 24 and has lots of ability. Whoever talked about Evra in this thread, you can't compare the two. Evra went through all his time here without picking up a major injury or any injury at all until last season. Rafael would thrive in a WB position and not sure how he can be judged on just 45mins of preseason.

213~~~
We sell our only natural RB but Kagawa stays? Nonsense.

214~~~
Having just read the article, I agree. Sounds like they named a group of players we knew were going anyway (Ando, Nani, Felllaini etc) and threw in Rafael to make people read it.

215~~~
I honestly don't think he's going anywhere. 3 at the back or not I can't see us moving on our only RB. He is such a frustrating player though, he needs to stay fit.

216~~~
I highly doubt that. Rafael simply isn't very highly rated by most non United fans. They still remember the rash and positionally unaware full back from about 5 years ago. We all know that he's turned it around big time since then but last season really didn't help him change the opinions of others. He, like everyone else, was fecking shit last season.

If we really are getting rid of him we should try to sign Coleman. Can play both RB and RWB easily.

217~~~
I'm willing to believe that Rafael was told he would be behind Valencia and Young or Cuadrado? in the near term.

However in the long term when healthy I think Rafael could be invaluable in a 4-3-3 and a younger and more natural alternative to Valencia or Young in the 3-5-2

218~~~
Careful, the Kagawa fanboys will soon be here to eat you alive.

219~~~
Maybe he'll be loaned out?

220~~~
Rafael isn't perfect, but he has a large number of positives going for him:

- He's still young, especially for a defender.
- When he's fit, he can run up and down all game.
- He's extremely passionate. It's a soft skill that is overlooked a lot.
- He's very good going forward - you only need to see the difference in the last few seasons when we had Smalling/Jones at RB over him.

Yes, he has negatives too. Primarily:

- Can be rash at times.
- Has to date a poor injury record.

However the former develops over time, and you'd back Van Gaal to coach him to become a more reliable player on the defensive front. And injuries, you never know. He could grow out of them or he may not, but alone it isn't a good reason to sell a player until its very clearly damaged his career like it has Anderson. He still has time on his side, does Rafael. 

Interestingly, it's such a nonsense rumour because in reality, Rafael's strengths and weaknesses are more suited to a 3-5-2 than a 4-3-3, so if we are going with wing backs it actually suits Rafael more. 

Not to mention, if we sell Rafael, we literally don't have a right back.

221~~~
No chance, he's too experienced to be loaned out now. It makes absolutely no sense. The only players who get loaned out after this much first team top level experience are those who are loaned with a view to a sale.

222~~~
You're right. Scratch that

223~~~
Who do you think would sign him should we sell him? PSG? Who even plays RB for them?

224~~~
Just got Aurier on loan, they'll sign him next year.

225~~~
Van der wiel and he had an injury prone season last year if I am not wrong. Btw what are the more reliable sources(Ian Ladyman, Mitten, Ogden etc) take on this? Is it only Daily Mail reporting this? Should be taken with a pinch of salt.

EDIT: DWelbz19 is right, completely forgot about Aurier going there on loan

226~~~
He brings so much fight and spirit to the pitch, I genuinely believe United are more likely to win when he plays.

I'd hate to lose him.

I kinda hope a season with shared duties and lets starts will allow his body to finally get over the injuries.

227~~~
So we are buying Hummels,Vidal,Di Maria and now LVG is going to add a RB to that list<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>...
A hungry, talented young player who is our only registered RB! This holds no water what so ever..

228~~~
Should redcafe's official twitter be tweeting smelly news like this?.. Seems odd.

229~~~
It's clear enough on the fact that it's the Daily Mail reporting it. No issue as far as I'm concerned.

Absolutely shocked if there's any truth to Rafael being told to pack it up, though. We're not overstaffed on the right (wing) back, and Rafael's shown more than enough for us to be patient with him. If nothing else, he'd be good to have around for squad depth.

Can't believe there's so many people agreeing with this notion on here!

230~~~
Yep, I think RB position should be dealt with next summer. We can’t rely on Rafael, hopefully this won’t be that much of a problem in 3-5-2, but when we go back to 4 at the back, then a proper right-back will be required (unless he can somehow sort out his fitness issues).
Selling him at this moment makes no sense whatsoever, considering the shape of our squad, but also how much money would we get for him now.
Yeah, I suppose he is little overrated among the united fans, and underrated by others. I rate him highly and as I stated many times, he’s the most suited player to wingback role (in our squad). I can’t wait to see him and Shaw on the flanks.
He won’t be sold (this summer).

231~~~
I'm sure LVG will probably come up with a new formation that requires no one on the right side

232~~~
He's probably not going to play regularly in the 3-5-2 but if we did change back to 4-3-3 he'd be perfect. Maybe LVG told him he won't be playing that much this season & gave Rafael the option.

If we were to sell him the only way i'd be happy about it is if we had a buy back option. I can't imagine we'd get a huge amount for him anyway so i'd rather sell him for a bit less & make sure we can get him back if we want.

233~~~
There are quite a few reasons for this story seeming absurd. First and foremost is the fact that if he goes, we've got no actual first team right back. 

He'd have to be a disruptive influence in the dressing room, a terrible player or likely to fetch a huge transfer fee for this story to have legs. None of which holds true.

Yawn.

234~~~
It would make no sense to sell him, even leaving aside his ability or injury record, we wouldn't get anything like decent value from selling him (we never do) and bringing in a replacement - which we'd surely have to do given we'd have four senior defenders left (and one of them is 19) - would cost much more in terms of transfer fees and likely wages as well.

Despite the poor source, I would worry that there might be something in this - bad news seems to have a habit of being true where we're concerned.

235~~~
Don't panic over a daily heil article. They've just lumped him in with the others because they know nothing about football and he speaks Portuguese so he must be like those other 'flops' Nani and Anderson. Which is actually unfair on Nani too as he had a couple of good years for us, but now it's time to go.

236~~~
Wouldn't make sense to sell Rafael due to his injuries considering we tried to get Vermaelen who is a known crock...

237~~~
I just saw "Made in Brazil" -- the journey of the twins from kids to United. Heart-warming. Great family, good kids.

Hope we don't ship him out.

238~~~
We aren't after Cuadrado so that theory can be put to bed.

239~~~
Daily Mail. Great source. Because that gossip shitpiece would be the first to know, obviously. I can see some of those names leaving, but what sense does it make to sell our only right back? Might want to keep an actual right back on board incase this back 3 thing doesn't work out, or for games where a back 4 is the way to go. I think Rafa would prosper as a wing back if he can stay fit.

240~~~
He's a good player but he's always bloody injured. I'll be sorry to see him leave though if true.

241~~~

If reports are true that he's among the castoffs then I'll be disappointed. He's one of my favourite players. He's generally played well when he's had a run of games and isn't injured. He was one of our best 3 players in 2012-13 with Carrick and RVP. I don't see any harm in keeping him. He's not a waste of spce like Anderson or Nani.

243~~~
It would be very difficult for us to sign a better RB than him. It would be an idiotic move selling him.

244~~~
He won't be sold. Even if it made any sense at all, Van Gaal has been extremely consistent (and outspokenly so) about getting a good look at every player before offloading. He barely even got a glance at Rafa (who looked good, in that brief window) before he picked up a knock. No way LVG would contemplate selling him without more assessment. Especially when he has plenty of confirmedly shit/unnecessary players to offload first.

245~~~
I hope he get's a few more chances to impress. I think the new system would actually suit him and for me pretty much the same as Shaw.

246~~~
I doubt he get's sold at this point since the squad is so badly imbalanced in other areas and in need of urgent attention.

247~~~
Rafael reminds me of Evans. They are both good when they are fully fit but they hardly ever are long enough. We won't miss him if we sell and replace him with a more dependable player. At this point I hope Varela takes his chance and cements a place in the first team this season. I see him being a starter in seasons to come if he fulfills his promise.

248~~~
I'd seriously doubt it tbh. Nothing I've seen of Varela has convinced me that he'll ever be good enough to play for us.

249~~~
I find him to be a better natural defender than the twins. He's not as rash as Rafael. His anticipation and awareness is better, he also times his runs better and moves the ball forward more effectively. I hope he gets a chance, thats all some players need, some actual competitive games for the first team. I always rated Blackett but most people on here don't think he's anything special, that Keane and Thorpe are better prospects. Blackett was our best defender in preseason. It was only preseason but against the level of competition we had the kid made a strong case for himself to be considered as backup in the first team stakes. I have the same hopes for Varela.

250~~~
So what will happen if/when we convert back to four at the back? Surely Van Gaal isn't expecting Young, Valencia or possibly Cuardado (if we sign him) to play right.

251~~~
Although there are rumours of him leaving, I'm not sure I believe them,. I was worried last night when Phil a Jones was introduced as 'Number 2, Phil Jones' twice on the PA and on the scoreboards, but he was wearing number 4 so it was just a ridiculous error.

252~~~
Really thought he would kick on to be the best RB, now hope we go for de Sciglio quickly.

253~~~
Far too injury prome.  We need a RB but this is going relatively unnoticed simply cuz of the desperation  of other areas.

254~~~
Get back Rafa. We will see the difference and drive he gives us when he returns.

255~~~
He's a very talented young lad, although he hasn't improved in the last couple of years but he is our best option for RB.  However he is too injury-prone and it seems LVG doesn't like that.  He may be sold next summer.

256~~~
All talks about Varela but this one never played for the first team, even in a friendly.

257~~~
Until he breaks down again...

258~~~
To be honest if we end up signing centre back then I can see Jones or Keane will play as a right back instead.
And if LVG still insist with 3 in the back then I can see Young or Valencia will spend his time as a wing back.

Definitely need a right back but I just can't see it happen this summer.

259~~~
BIB, he was one of our best players (behind RVP & Carrick) in the season before last?

260~~~
Which highlights how pathetic our team has been tbh. You said it yourself that Carrick was one of our best players.  Carrick wouldn't even make the bench in Europe's elite (Bayern, Real Madrid, Barcelona etc).  It wasn't just Rafael two seasons ago, it was SAF's miracles and still Rafael hadn't improved since 2011 and those injuries are destroying his career. Comes a time when you have to look forward and assess the potential of your players. Personally I like Rafael but how many games in a row does he manage to play?

Keeping players that spend most of the season in the treatment room is just a waste of time and money.  Look at Hargreaves, and although I don't want to admit it, Fletcher is not the same player as well.

261~~~
Disagree with your post. In the 2012/13 season, Rvp, Carrick and rafael were our 3 best players then. Rafael had his best season by quite a way and improved dramatically that season. He carried us in some games when the others didn't turn up (like pool away). Last season everyone was bad barring De Gea. So judging on that, yeah Carrick wouldn't be near Europes elite. None of our outfield players would be. But that season he was good and yes, I do agree we had a poor team that season but that shouldn't detract that Rafael clearly improved that season whilst others didn't. 

Again, have to disagree. Rafael showed that less injuries and given a run in the team how much he improved. He still has flaws, injuries being the big one. You can't compare Hargreaves to Rafael. We signed him with a dodgy knee and only got one 'decent' season out of him. Rafael has given us a lot more than that when he plays. Fletch is different again. His was illness and he is 29 now. Rafael is still only 24 and still has time on his side.

Just found a HLs vid from 2012/13

If he's fit enough to take cold water, he is fit enough to play this weekend...hopefully!

hehe i couldn't understand a word he said, but his reaction at the end was great <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

hope to see him in the starting eleven on sunday

264~~~
Heard on TV that he got injured (again) in the warm up before the Swansea game, that's the reason why Lingard was playing as a starter.

265~~~
Yeh, hopefully we see him back against Sunderland, gives us so much more balance and drive.

266~~~
Van Gaal has said Rafael is fit for the Swansea match.....then rumours in midweek he's again injured.........probably true because he isn't in the matchday squad and hasn't travelled to Sunderland

Some bodies aren't made for football

267~~~
Rafael is one who probably doesn't benefit from the old "clean slate" with the new boss. As far as LVG is concerned he is an injury prone RB who wasn't good enough to make a fairly poor Brazil WC squad. Unless he is pulling up trees in training it's easy to see why Valencia may be favoured, and why we are wanting to sign Di Maria (who I believe LVG will also want to utilise as a WB regularly, if not always)

268~~~
<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/sSGJY3tV4l/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

EDIT: For some reason it isn't shown what he wrote but this is what he put: 
Can't not wait to be on the pitch and enjoy a football. #veryclosed #training #love

269~~~
Can't wait to see him on the pitch again but, I do have to wonder why players like Rafael and others that get all these muscle injuries don't try yoga like Giggs did. I really think he'd be one of the best RB around if he'd stay clear of injuries. He's the one player that you can count to give a damn in driving us forward regardless of the rest of the teams malaise.

270~~~
We need this guy and Shaw back. In the formation we have now the wing backs are so important and I think him, Shaw and Di Maria will improve our squad so much.

271~~~
Love this guy! Future captain.

272~~~
Of which club?? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

273~~~
Rafael and Shaw back after the International break if we are lucky, that might add a bit of penetration from the wide areas.

274~~~
Yep, of Injuries FC

275~~~
Or FC get stupid red cards/give away stupid penalties alongside with Jones.

276~~~
Bunch of cnuts, we have the worst fans in the world. Fickle glory hunting muppets.

277~~~
Can't wait to see him back on the pitch. Love his enthusiasm!! With Cleverley,Ando leaving, I guess he ll a scapegoat from now on. Anyway I think he ll be great with the wingback role.. Him and Shaw on either side will hopefully help us opening up the field a bit.

278~~~
some of the comments here are awful, just awful..

279~~~
You are his parent

280~~~
He needs to get on the pitch and show some fans exactly how good he can be. He is a top top player when he has a run of games, he is the perfect player for his attacking and defending ability.

281~~~
just that LvG doesnt rate him. Time to prove him wrong Rafael or you are the next one gone.

282~~~
Only here is rated, if you put him on sale I don't think you can get more than 5 million.

283~~~
So, is the sicknote available for the game tomorrow?

284~~~
Please be back tomorrow. Such an improvement to our right-hand side offensively when he's in it.

285~~~
He has barely played under LVG even in pre-season. Once he gets fit and plays a few games, LVG will love him. He has all the attributes needed to become a top notch wingback, just needs to mature and add composure to his game. Just hope he will get past his injury troubles.

286~~~
Can't wait to see the difference he will bring. Instantly makes us a better side when he plays.

287~~~
Anything less than £15m would be criminal, he is an excellent player and if he shook off the injuries he could become the top right back in the league.

288~~~
I miss him so much.

289~~~
He was the top right back in the league alongside Zabaleta last to last season when he stayed fit for the most part.

Why the hell would we sell him anyway. Aren't exactly overflowing with RB's.

290~~~
It's depressing to read some of the comments regarding Rafael here. 

During the last year, Utd has played quite a few awful games, but more than a lack of quality, it was the lack of urgency and energy in the team that bothered me. 
Even when Ferguson was still in charge, there were games when the whole team just didn't give the impression to care enough to make an extra effort, even in games against Liverpool. Rafael always was and is the player who leads by example. The player who could go off the field early after getting injured, but you know for sure he won't go off the field without having given everything he has to get us a result. 
He may run way out of position to finish his forward run by pressing the goalkeeper, but it motivates the players around him.

Is that really the kind of player we should be criticizing? The guy loves playing football, loves playing for Man Utd and will certainly be frustrated about the injuries.

Sure, he's injured too much, but I don't get how some can have so little respect for a player who always gives more than 100% and doesn't hide when things go wrong. If anything, we need more players like him (with less injuries of course)

291~~~
We need more players with heart like Rafael, but we can do without the injuries. I don't see them getting better with age either. He's no good for us if he can't be there when we really need him. Im not saying sell, but we need to buy a more dependable player who can compete side by side with him for a spot (like Marcelo and Coentrao at Real).

292~~~
We need this man back. Is there a timeline on his return or what's happening?

293~~~
LVG said yesterday (I think) all the injured players except Carrick, will be back after the international break. Rafael and Shaw are the players we need back quickly.

294~~~
I thought he was back in training, but he's going to need a while as he barely had a pre season.

295~~~
That would be a huge boost if true.

296~~~
Let's hope that is the case

297~~~
"Van Gaal is the Hitler of the Brazilian players; he is arrogant, proud and has a problem," <i>Marca</i> quote Giovanni as saying.

But seriously, I think he's gonna be fine. Valencia seems like the type of player coaches love though. Hard working and athletic... although he obviously has his faults.

298~~~
I highly rate Rafael but I don't think he's the saviour  to our wingback issues as some are making him out to be.

Even at his peak, his contributions in the attacking third were inconsistent to be honest. It doesn't make him a bad player, he's a right back not a winger, but he will be judged on the attacking side probably more than the defensive one and I can easily see him coming into a lot of criticism. Good player for us and I hope I'm wrong about this.

299~~~
Valencia's flaws are so much more prominent without an overlapping Rafael to help hide them. 
I don't think LvG rates him atm unfortunately (going by the rumours in the papers that he was one of those LvG told could leave), but I don't see how we wont if he gives him a run when he's fit. He plays with so much more urgency, passion and belief in himself than Valencia. For me, Shaw and Rafael on the flanks (whether at fullback or wingback) is a massive improvement on Young and Valencia.

300~~~
Yeah, like being absolutely shite at football.

301~~~
Hes Evras replacement. The lovable full back who fuxking loves our club, plays with his heart and is damn good. He is our right side when hes fit and on form, much like Evra was our left side while he was here.

302~~~
I think Shaw is even more limited attacking wise than Rafael actually right now.

But Rafael with more license to attack in this role will be a great improvement on Valencia.  Though not as positionally disciplined.

I miss this little guy. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

303~~~
Hope he is back soon. Cannot take anymore Valencia.

304~~~
If only he had Evra's immunity to injuries.

305~~~
How so? He's very used to the right back role & given more freedom to venture forward would be beneficial to his game. 
Valencia bring very little to the team, is all right foot & pretty easy for fullbacks to contain. Raf can be an exceptional player when his head is on right & has all the attributes to be an exceptional wing back (bar being very prone to injury).
Would honestly hate to see him leave United as he's got an awful lot of talent & if he can stay fit is certainly one of the best right backs in the league.

306~~~
Anyone who thinks Rafael will provide more attacking threat than Valencia in our current formation is deluded IMO. He's a fullback. He does his best work when the opposition is outnumbered and he can overlap.  

Isolate him against two opposition players, with the only option being beating both of them on the dribble or picking out a static Juan Mata infield and people will soon realise what tough job Valencia has had this season. 

Same applies to Shaw on the opposite flank, only more so (he's a less attacking fullback)

307~~~
You know, this wing back molarky isn't unique to United. There are plenty of wing backs who attack just fine without having another player overlapping.

It's all about timing and variety, actually being able to carry the ball inside as well as outside and knowing when you can make a run into the space behind their fullback and in turn forcing them back rather than fearing them exploiting the space in behind you. 


At the moment, Valencia does one thing, not because that's the only physically possible thing that can be done, but because he is so painfully limited as a footballer that he can only do this. He has absolutely zero change pace on the ball and no guile whatsoever. His idea of beating a man is standing still, threatening to push the ball around them, before squaring it back to whoever is behind him. 

You're a smart man, Pogue, I'm genuinely baffled that you cannot see how completely void of any ability Valencia is. It's not a case of people being harsh on him, it's two years of one dimensional crap from him.

308~~~
I haven't watched a lot of 352 but I've never seen a wingback as isolated as Valencia was yesterday. On his own against two defenders every time he got the ball (apart from two incidents where a clever pass from Rooney finally created space). Not getting into a broader debate about his form in the last two seasons (which has not been good) but the current formation (how we use it anyway) woule make any winger look bad and a specialist fullback look absolutely hopeless.

309~~~
What Rafael will do better than Valencia is 1)Cross first time better or cross better in general even if inconsistent sometimes. Valencia currently is sucking at this most importantly and sucking real bad. 2) Dribble little bit better to create space. 3) Make runs inside the channels actually which Rafael does even from fullback at times and take some shots. Here he will have more room to do this.

Think he is more suited to this role than Shaw is actually.

310~~~
Valencia tbf has been pretty solid defensively and mantains width better. Rafael in that role will be more free and roaming inside slightly more and less of a physical presence.

He'll do well anyway though will need to adapt his runs and timing of it which he can.

311~~~
I don't think you can blame just the formation. Valencia has looked awful on the right for some time, even with the support. 

It's a shame because he was better when he first came. But I think it's a combination of him losing his confidence and aggression as well as defenders figuring him out.

312~~~
I disagree - Valencia is a defensive liability and this was shown numerous times last year. He can get away with it a bit more in a 3-5-2 though of course.

313~~~
Last year? When he played RB ? Yeah, he was caught out positionally a few times and in terms of tracking the runners deep but as a RWB this season he has been pretty solid defensively. 

Young on whatever flank he plays looks way more dodgy and panicky in the defensive end.

314~~~
Yeah fair enough.

315~~~
He's been unimpressive, individually, but has helped bring the best out of Rafael. The one thing he has consistently done well the last two seasons has been slipping Rafael through with clever little passes around the box. Just don't see Rafael being anywhere near his best when he's stuck out on the wing on his own. Will be like that experiment we tried with Evra as a left winger. A player we all thought was a great attacking player looked utterly bereft of ideas when asked to lead from the front.

316~~~
Could be true. Certainly another reason why I'm not keen on the 3-5-2 to be honest.

317~~~
I love him can't wait for him to get back and i hope this 3-5-2 experiment stops because Rafael and Shaw will have a difficult time playing as Wingbacks rather than Fullbacks, him and Shaw as Fullbacks along with Di maria and Adnan on the wings as part of 4-3-3 will be soo exciting to watch we'd have abundance of place in the wide areas.

318~~~
Agree, can't see Shaw and Rafael faring any bettter when they will be outnumbered every time they get the ball outwide. We need to drop this experiment and play a formation that our players, both new and old, are used to.

319~~~
Most people are excited about Rafael and Shaw returning in the hope of that being the catalyst of a shift to 4-3-3 because we'll have fit full backs, LVG originally name dropped Di Maria as a winger, Young and Valencia as poor as they are happen to be wingers also so we have the players to play there.

I don't know. But Rafael is someone you can't dislike when he's fit. It's just frustrating that he's made from glass.

320~~~
Do we actually know where he is?

Where the feck is he?

321~~~
Being that half the team will be new, then I think this "experiment" may work out once everyone gets in.

322~~~
nobody knows. Shouldnt he be fit 2 weeks ago? Just ridiculous speculation on my part but what if LvG said to him that he doesnt feature in his plans and should be looking for a new club.<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

323~~~
But that's ridiculous, with him on one side and Shaw on the other, we'd be so much better, surely.

324~~~
We would be much better but Rafael needs to stay fit. I believe this will be his last year to prove he can play week in week out if not another RB needs to come in with Rafael as backup.

325~~~
Was it SAF's last season, or the season before, when he was fit for a large part of the season, was one of the best right backs in the league and scored a number of goals? I remember having him in my FF team and him getting me loads of points. 

That's the Rafael we need back.

326~~~
It would be more than ridiculous it would be idiotic. Just like when glancing through this thread and in among the praise for prob the best rb in the league you read these clowns slating him for being injured.

We saw Mata drifting wide centrally on the right a lot against Burnley <or whover else weve played sadly>only to lay the ball to the ineffective Valencia to do what he does best for 3 years,feck all.
Rafael,and Shaw on the otherside,are absolutely essential,when going forward,to supply that extra runner to compensate for the lack of pace our front 3,more vanP and Mata rather tha Rooney,offer.

I dont see a problem with vanP,Rooney and Mata in the same team,they will work,and with players like Herrera/Carrick/Blind who are possession orientated,if we are going to try and pass teams to death we need that to have those few players that can burst and explode with movement and do away with our zombie nation passing.

Raf/Shaw/diMaria in theory offer the change this team has been crying out for.

Think we will see a change to a 4-1-1-2-1-1<really a 442> after the break to suit the panel.2 cbs,rb,lb,dm,cm,ram,lam,ss,striker.

--------------dave-------------
-------Jones-------Rojo--------
Raf-------------------------Shaw
------------------Blind----------
---------Herrera-----------------
Mata--------------------diMaria
---------Rooney-----------------
------------------VanP-----------

We can split to a 3 at the back  when we having a go,move into a diamond, or drop diMaria into a 3 in midfield and  Rooney when covering or under pressure.

327~~~
We definitely need an alternative to him on the right that isn't called Valencia. He is just injured too often to not have a quality backup in his position.

328~~~
If only we could transfer Valencia's durability into Rafael <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

329~~~
Was SAF's last season when he was at his best. Stayed fit for most part and showed how well he would improve playing weak in weak out. He has actually improved with every season he has been here with the exception of last season. Then again, nearly the whole squad regressed last season and Rafa was no way the worst player in the squad.

When we get him back, we will see a difference as he is willing to run with the ball and take on people and also If Rafael starts, Valencia won't in the formation LVG plays. So just needs to stay fit, it is his only flaw nowadays.

330~~~
That's right he was arguably the beast RB in the league that season. But he needs to stay injury free i can't see LVG having the patience with constantly injured players.

331~~~
so will he be ready for QPR, anybody knows?

332~~~
He was supposedly ready for Sunderland. Not sure what happened since then.

333~~~
Had a knock right before the game I think. Said he was close to training a week ago.

<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/sSGJY3tV4l/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

334~~~
I think one of the biggest problems of this apparent 3-5-2 if the lack of a wing back. If we played Young and Valencia with RVP up top and they did exactly the same we'd be calling it a 4-3-3. Therefore by definition we're playing a 3-3-4 (look at when Januzaj played as "wing back"), which is obviously too offensive.

With Shaw and Rafael it would be a far more versatile formation where you are solid and hard to break down when you don't have the ball (5-3-2) but attacking and incisive when you do.

335~~~
My life feels more complete with Rafael fit and starting every game.

336~~~
Do or die season for him. If he can't prove he can stay fit and reliable for a season we need to bring in a new right back.

337~~~
Unless Van Gaal considers Valencia capable as a right back, we should bring in a new right back regardless of Rafael's fitness.
It's the only position we don't have cover for (or at least decent cover), strange knowing Rafael's past (injuries).

By far my favourite player, but there should be more competition at RB.

338~~~
I'm a huge fan of Rafael but I do worry about his inability to stay fit, if only he had Evra's constitution. Personally I want to see an end to 3-5-2 and Rafael and Shaw playing as fullbacks.

It's funny but during the transfer window it was said LvG didn't like South American players because he felt they were mercenaries, yet 3 of the 4 he brought in are South American, so maybe it's just Brazilian's he doesn't like, or more to the point the ones that prefer partying to professionalism which has been a character flaw of many Brazilian talents over the years. Rafael doesn't have that flaw, his only problem is he's injury prone.

339~~~
Its not just trying to take players on. But its about that space and if they have the balls to go up, try to attack and cross instead of just sitting back and trying to defend all the time. And the thing is they wont be isolated. If they are on the wing, then it sort of creates this 'M' or 'W' formation and that helps the attack. Picture something like the one below. If thats the case and Shaw does drag two defenders with him, Herrera pushes up and creates this formation. This is so much better than the one we are playing right now with the wing backs stuck at the half way line and central midfielders are too deep and they try to make something happen by playing long balls over the top. 

Shaw-----------Rooney-----------Falcao

---------Herrera----------Mata------

-------------------Blind

From what I saw at the WC, Netherlands were playing a high defensive line and pushed up the field when they didn't have the ball. And the defensive mid stays behind to tidy up in case we lose the ball and in this case Blind/Carrick will have to play that role. 

Do you think Kuyt and Blind took on two players at the same time at the WC? The answer is no because its not their job primarily to play as a winger but to be an option as an outlet when our attack needs one. Just running up the pitch might create space because that run drags a defender with them. This in turn creates a bit of space for others to run into or put in a cross. 

Young and Valencia don't do attacking nor defending very well. They are stuck midway not knowing when to attack. If they don't push up when we have the ball, then we become way too narrow and expect the strikers to provide width and there are a couple of problems with this. One is they aren't exactly great at it because they like to play through the middle and two if they do go across and provide width, there is no one to cross the ball into the box to.

341~~~
So he's expected to start against QPR then?

342~~~
Hope so, actually think he'll be quality as a wing back. Willing to take risks too unlike turn back Tony.

343~~~
Hoping so. He will make such a difference, either as a wingback or in a flat back four.

344~~~
I think I'll be more excited to see him start that Falcao but, that's because I've got an unnatural desire to huggle him. What I wouldn't give to see LVG start him and Shaw with just 2 CB.

345~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Young and skinny!

346~~~
Still think Valencia will be first choice right wing-back.

347~~~
Rafael is better at going forward and better defending. The only thing going for Valencia is Rafael's injuries.

348~~~
Remember his debut? Came on against Arsenal and scored a left footed volley only to immediately get the ball because we were down 2 to 1.

Besides improved fitness he needs to score and assist more because he has the ability.

Can't fecking wait to see him back.

349~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> Wasn't his debut, was it?

350~~~
His debut was against Newcastle at OT on the first day of that season.

351~~~
Fell in love with him that match at Arsenal. It was such a disappointing day, not often Arsenal out fought us but on that day they did. They wanted it far more than us but when Rafael came on, it all changed, he was driving the team forward, making tackles and well the goal was fantastic.

I still remember the tackle on Denilson I think it was, I shouted at the TV, give him the fecking armband.

352~~~
Will he be back this week?

353~~~
Seems like he is available but going by van Gaal's want for fitness, I think he will be on the bench.

354~~~
If the likes of Anderson and Cleverely can get so many years at this club despite being shite, Rafael can get more time given the fact that he has proven to be a solid right back and the last title winning year he was fit most of the season.

355~~~
The difference is that there is a new manager now so times have changed.  We have no idea how he will rate Rafael.

356~~~
Anticipating his return to action just as much as most of our debutantes. His dynamism on the right is sorely missing when we have to witness Valencia predictably drill crosses at fullbacks shins week-in, week-out.

357~~~
Looking forward to seeing his name on the teem sheet and i pray he can stay fit for a few months straight,

358~~~
Seconded. He'll make a big, big difference to our attacking play.

359~~~
It would be brilliant if he got back to his 12/13 form. Was brilliant that season, level with zabaleta IMO. His main problem has always been injuries, lets hope he can get over them.

360~~~
Even before the goal he was already urging the team on - he has such an infectious way of playing the game, in a good way that is. Definitely could use more of his ilk in the team.

361~~~
It's weird. He was in my top three or four favourite players at one point but now he has been out for ages (and only fit briefly) I have forgotten how much I like him. Now that he is close to returning I am getting excited. Recently watched the goal he scored against QPR a few seasons ago.  Great strike.

362~~~
injuries aside, he is a top player. i'm sure we are a much better side when rafael is playing.

363~~~
I feel like this. Can't wait for him to come back.

364~~~
He could be great at wing back.

365~~~
Pleased he's back, he's our best RB by quite some distance, lets hope he can stay fit. Because after a run of games he shows he's a top player!

And wing back I think could really suit him.

366~~~
Hasn't there been talks that he is on his way out? (No source on it). Would be a shame, but I imagine he has to if we are to "cleanse" the squad and rebuild... Guess a valid reason to kick him out would be the fact that he rarely plays anymore, very injury prone, but surely a great player when fit.

367~~~
When he plays we look like a far better team,  its weird that a right back can have such influence. Then again, his replacements being so utterly crap might have something to do with it.

368~~~
when Dani Alves was at Sevilla, he practically ran the show from right-back, so yeah it is possible.

And it speaks to Rafael's quality in that in our better seasons 2011-12,12-13, having him really made a difference, in spite of the fact that there were so many other really good players.

369~~~
Not sure that's entirely true. Not last season anyway. Rafael played his part in some absolutely shocking performances. Usually featuring woeful defending from him.

The season before was a different story. We just have to hope he recaptures that sort of form.

370~~~
Agreed he was shocking last season and is vastly overrated on here. If you have to go back more than 12 months to justify your praise for a player he should really have competition for his place. He's nothing on Coleman and thats going to become more apparent as this season goes on....

371~~~
Coleman is a top RB but to say Rafael has nothing on him is ridiculous. The pro-Everton nonsense gets too much on here at times.

372~~~
Disagree on that. Sure, Coleman has improved and Rafael had a poor season by his standards last season but Rafael has shown far more during his career in my opinion. On a far bigger stage too.

373~~~
Shown far more <i>what</i>, exactly?

374~~~
His quality, ability to deal with top class opposition, the way he can completely change the way his team plays. It's nothing against Coleman but Rafael is the better footballer, anyone questioning that needs to find a bus-stop. In saying that, Coleman had a better season last year but so did pretty much every Everton player, that doesn't mean they are better footballers than those at United.

375~~~
Rafael and Coleman are a lot closer than many on here seem to think. The main difference is Coleman's ability to stay fit. Rafael's recurrent injuries have been a real hindrance to his career so far. The one and only time he avoided injuries for a lengthy period he hit some really impressive form. Otherwise, he's been kind of stop start, with ups and downs in his form.

Coleman has slightly better stats going forward despite playing for team that (up until last season) was a lot worse than United. 11 goals and 10 assists in 100 games (compared to 4 and 11 in 86) Rafael makes more tackles and interceptions but also gets dribbled more frequently and gives away more fouls.

376~~~
We'll just have to disagree, I guess.
I do agree that it's not true that Rafael has nothing on Coleman though.

I'd give the edge to Coleman as a player right now - I think he leaves his mark on games more, gets forward better (is harder to stop when in full flow), links up better, has better end product, is better at choosing when to go in for the tackle, and has a better low-level.
He also doesn't look like slowing down any time soon.

That's based on him playing the same 19 teams as Rafael on a weekly basis.
But, like you say, he hasn't also been tested at the levels Rafael has (though I don't think Rafael has been anything amazing in Europe), so maybe he'd crumble at a bigger club.

377~~~
No doubt Coleman at the moment is the better player, at the end of the day you are only as good as your last game and Rafael hasn't played this season. On the back of last season too, Rafael was part of a struggling United side while Coleman was part of a team who had the season of their lives.

I think Rafael still has what he has shown us, he just needs to be fit to show it again. And Rafael on his game, is miles ahead of Coleman in my opinion.

378~~~
Seems to be the only player in our team who plays with any urgency and likes to speed the game up when we attack. Can't wait to have him back.

379~~~
Apologies for being a stats bore but even when we compare Rafael's best ever season (2012/13) with Coleman from the same period, there's very little between them.

<b>Rafael</b>
Goals: 3
Assists: 3
Tackles: 3.1
Interceptions: 2.1
Fouls: 1.5
Was Dribbled: 1.5
Pass Completion: 84%

<b>Coleman</b>
Goals: 0
Assists: 5
Tackles: 2.4
Interceptions: 1.9
Fouls: 0.7
Was Dribbled: 0.2
Pass Completion: 80%

Similar pattern to their PL career overall.

380~~~
He had a few iffy games after the new year, culminating in that daft game against Liverpool in which he was probably still our best player. "Shocking" is exaggerative rubbish but I'd expect no less from you. 

He played well on his original return from injury at the back end of 2013. Read back through his player thread and you'll find my appraisal is a lot more accurate. As for Coleman, forget it. He's at Everton and the chances we strike up a deal with that lot again verges on non-existent.

381~~~
"Afew iffy games"...."daft game against Liverpool"......having to choose carefully selected words in rationalising his awful form says it all. We were daft to pay him during this period I wonder how he'd see that......abit iffy on our part! He was fortunate many fans choose to blame Moyes for players hiding last season but under LVG if anything its worse thus far and fans need to find some other logic for what is largely players simply not being good enough for too long last season. He'll be replaced anyway on the back of his injury record so I dont know why im bothering to argue.

382~~~
The night before the Liverpool game his wife gave birth and he had very little sleep. Coleman is a great player going forward but people seem to ignore that Everton do suffer big defeats and it isn't just the rest of the defence that be at fault for this.

383~~~
I rationalise because I know what I'm talking about and because I don't have a propensity for acting like a stroppy mare every time we happen to lose a game. I believe in the players for the most part, did last season under the dinosaur decimating our club, and still do under the new man. Rafael is one of those players.

You're over exaggerating Rafael's "shocking" form. I've explained why and you haven't really responded back to that. If you can name some legitimate errors, and there must be many I'm sure, then perhaps your assessment would make a little more sense. As it stands, I'm correct. He was iffy after the new year, should have been sent off against Liverpool, picked up some early yellow cards in dodgy ten minute spells against teams like West Ham, but that aside, his defending wasn't really a constant source of goals. If anything it was his crossing that had a bigger negative impact on the team's performance. It needs a lot of work. But carry on lad.

As for Moyes, he got the blame because he was a raging moron. He deserved all that came his way.

384~~~
I reckon with Rafael fit and (eventually) Shaw fit, we'll revert to a back 4. Hope so anyway.

385~~~
Can't wait for Rafael to come back. I really hope LvG gives him a run in the side. I miss his drive and determination. Last season wasn't one of his best but to claim he was shocking is such a ridiculous over exaggeration. In that case everyone but DDG was shocking.

386~~~
Been very good and has made intelligent use of of the ball unlike Valencia. 

Managed to look despite Evans trying his best to sell him short

387~~~
How great to see him back, such energy and enthusiasm. Lifts the whole team, lifts the crowd etc.

388~~~
Great half by him! Love him to bits and a terrific player - looks much smarter and better on the ball than Valencia, and he isn't a slouch either, so let's keep him!

389~~~
Definitely looks like the Rafeal of the 12/13 season. Great to see him back.

390~~~
He's been brilliant. Drives us forward and is almost a leader from the back.

391~~~
Di maria is stealing the show but Rafael has been great this half. Showing how much better he is than our other options and how much better we are as a team having a proper right back playing.

392~~~
The difference between having Rafael or Valencia on the right hand side of our defence is huge. So glad to see Rafa back.

393~~~
Oh my god how much I've missed our Rafael, hope he stays injury free, he truly is a quality RB.

394~~~
One of the players we miss the most when he is out. Clearly our best outlet on the right flank and he just makes a world of difference to our team when fit.

395~~~
Coleman who? <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

396~~~
It's actcually embarassing how a fullback is much better attacking wise than our actual winger who plays there. Judging by Rafael's first half performance, Valencia isn't good even as a backup, because the difference is enormous.

397~~~
A timely reminder as to why I love him. Brilliant!

398~~~
Goddamn, I hope this boy can stay fit. He's been excellent. What a little rogue.

399~~~
We have missed him.

400~~~
From front to back, brilliant today! The difference he adds is big. He always pressures the opposition on the ball and forces them back and made some great blocks and tackles. Even just before he subbed and looking tired, he put in a great block and set us off on the attack again. Didn't stop running forward at all and was always an outlet for us on the right. Great match from him

401~~~
Sooo glad to have him back, we've really missed his inter-changing abilities down that right side.

402~~~
Please don't get injured.

403~~~
There was a great bit of play in the second half we he played a one two with Herrera (I think) and he burst past a player in the box and set up mata (I think). Was a cracking bit of play.

404~~~
Please don't get injured. I can't bare Valencia.

405~~~
I cant believe we were supposed to have put him up for sale. To play who? That wanker Valencia.

406~~~
God, what a difference having him back!

407~~~
feck me he's brilliant. Just brilliant. 

Makes the whole right side about 99% more threatening when he plays.

408~~~
He's a great player, it's just his fitness issues where there's a worry over him. Let's hope he can keep fit otherwise we're looking at playing fecking Valencia there.

409~~~
Great to have him back.

410~~~
You could the see difference in talent as soon as he was replaced by turn back Tony.

411~~~
Love him <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

412~~~
Keep healthy and have a great season!

413~~~
My favourite player for a reason. Absolutely delighted to have him back.

414~~~
Same as last season, whenever Rafael players we are just that bit more fluid.

415~~~
Please don't get injured!

416~~~
The sheer enthusiasm and desire shown was like a breath of fresh air compared to watching Valencia retreat constantly.

417~~~
Beast today. 

Please stay fit Rafa, we need you when you play like today. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

418~~~
Great to have him back, top player and really improves the side. Love his passion for the team.

419~~~
world class performance today, very pleased with him after long time out with injury hopefully he stays fit this season and on.

420~~~
his link up with Herrera was fantastic. Always bombing forward and fearless in the tackle. Love it.

421~~~
Stay injury free and this guy is class,you can criticize him for being "rash" but remove that fire from his game and he won't be the same player. I like the energy and enthusiasm he brings - and he's a good footballer too, fearless, can pass, can cross and makes good runs. I like Rafael, I just hate that he gets constantly injured.

422~~~
I hope LVG manages his game time, we need to get it right in regards to Rafael's fitness because he is an wonderful player when fit.

I love his fire and tempo.

423~~~
Nice to have him back in the side and looked like his old self which is good to see.

424~~~
Was brilliant, and it's to no surprise that we look like a much better attacking force down the right when he is playing. Just needs to stay fit and we are sorted for the right back position. No more Valencia.

425~~~
Absolutely brilliant to have him back! His interplay with Herrera was fantastic! He needs an intelligent player like him to interplay with

426~~~
Of all the players coming back from injury, he is the most important. What a difference he makes. He defends well and the forward runs he makes is also so refreshing. He is better than Valencia and Young in both the attacking and defending departments. I have a feeling he is going to be the Carrick from two seasons ago. One of the most important players for us and if he is injured we are fecked.

427~~~
I almost forgot how good Rafael can be when he's 100% fit. One of the best right backs in the league when he's in this physical form.

428~~~
He trained for what, 5 days? What a performance. Damn his injuries, same story every season, gives us tremendous drive on the right side but then the injuries set in.

429~~~
So good to have him back. Now stay fit you fecker.

430~~~
We've really missed him lately.

431~~~
Was awesome today. For him its always about injuries

432~~~
Wrap him in cotton wool.

433~~~
He makes such a huge difference to our side over Valencia it's incredible.

Case and point is the left footed 100 degrees pass into Herrera(?) who fed Mata and he hit it over the bar. Valencia would never in history have made that pass.

434~~~
A reminder of just how good he is when fully fit and in form. Beast of a right back when that's the case.

435~~~
After getting a bit annoyed with him because of his injuries (I know not his fault), I have to admit it was fantastic to have him back doing what we know he can do. 
God, can't write more, after all have to visit almost every player's thread today to write how good they have been <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

436~~~
A healthy reminder of how much he adds to us when fit, the contrast when TBT replaced him was stark, please keep our little Ninja Turtle fit Louie!

437~~~
Embodies the importance of fullback/wingbacks in modern football, the contrast between him and Valencia was embarrassing, has his mind made up before I receives the ball, rarely does he feel the need to pass backwards, without playing proper wingers they'll be a lot of space for he and Shaw/Rojo to exploit.

Evans did try injurying him early on though, two beautiful hospital passes.

438~~~
Excellent return from Rafa today with his energy and positivity down the right. Made a big difference.

439~~~
The key word there supposed. Think it was all garbage to be honest.

440~~~
I hope his doubters now shut up and doubted his quality

441~~~
Rafael please stay injury free.

442~~~
So many positives today, he was a massive one of them.

443~~~
Next season we need to invest for a decent back-up to Rafael, Valencia isn't it.

444~~~
Was wonderful today.

I think LVG's bad ass doctrine will hopefully motivate him enough to increase his defensive skills so he can finally develop into the all round world class full back he is destined to become.

445~~~
He is one of those players with his injuries, despite being out he plays well instantly. Aguero comes to mind as a similar player.

446~~~
Impressed me a lot today. Didn't expect him to pull out that kind of performance after being out for that long.

447~~~
Love this wee fella. Gave 100% today! I really think he will flourish under Van Gaal.

448~~~
Gave 100% today but didn't think he looked very comfortable. Still seems to find spac going forward better than almost anyone but end product is never so good. If he stays injury free all year it would do him so much good

449~~~
Last season his final ball was just dreadful which was annoying as hell because he was more than decent in that department the season before. This season looks good so far.

450~~~
Great to have the little fecker back!

451~~~
All 70 minutes of it.

452~~~
Yeah...

453~~~
He's definitely the man to take over from Evra, in terms of being great on the ball, a leader and passionate for the club. Love him.

454~~~
After having very little game time this season, I thought he was brilliant today. Made some crucial interceptions, and was just brilliant going forward. I just really hope he can stay fit.

455~~~
<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/s8DFttNV9j/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

Text says: So good to be back doing what I love. Great win ⚽️<a class="externalLink" href="http://instagram.com/manchesterunited" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@manchesterunited</a>

456~~~
Says a lot that the game slowed down when he came off. Always give 100% and i love he links up brilliantly with who ever comes to that side.

457~~~
Enthusiasm and energy.

Lovely thing was, while these features normally makes him stand out like a sore thumb, today he was one of a whole bunch of tenacious bastards (Di Maria, Herrera, Rojo, Blind).

Great energy on display throughout the side which we've lacked.

458~~~
What it does highlight though is that we need a proper RB back up (because Rafa will get injured). Smalling and Jones won't link play like he does. We have missed Shaw and Rafael greatly. Shaw will provide something similar on the left hand side once fully fit.

459~~~
He is such a quality full back. If he can stay off that bloody treatment table he can become one of the worlds best.

460~~~
Thats very true. I'm starting to love this new team already.

461~~~
He was great considering it was his 1st game of the season. Really pleased LVG started him over Valencia too which hopefully shows that he is 1st choice. Performance should've confirmed that too.

462~~~
He was great, but I don't want to get too excited, since he will get injured soon enough.

463~~~
Welcome back Rafa. I hope he stays fit so that the Coleman lot would shut up and have a wank.

464~~~
I think what i like most about his performance today was the energy and enthusiasm in the first 20 mins. 
When the ball came to him he was speeding the play up with a good early pass or a good pass into feet and the run to give a good option for the 1-2.
A lot of the other players were looking a bit sluggish and nervy for that first 20 mins but he was just really calm, confident and used the ball brilliantly.
Kind of set the tempo of the game for me.

465~~~
it was so painful watching Valencia come on for him he was the only sour note today, he only played for a bit but it was enough to convince me his future lies elsewhere. 

Hope rafa stays fit as I don't think I can handle seeing Valencia play RB.

466~~~
Great to see him back. Just gives us so much more balance and energy. Has not played for a while, so I'm sure he will improve. So many new flashy toys out there but Rafa, you are still my love.

467~~~
Played very well, did a lot better than Valencia or Young have done in the position in league matches

468~~~
Yep. Rafael>Coleman as long as he's fit. His link up play is top notch and in 12/13 was brilliant all around. Just needs that consistency back which he'll get if he stays clear of injuries.

469~~~
Tbf, Young and Valencia have played a different Wingback position and had more burden attacking wise with slower balls and less players to link with as central part of the team was dysfunctional first 3 games.

He's obviously still a lot better though.

470~~~
It's only a few posters though, with their painfully boring agenda. Thankfully, there are quiet a sane few around.

471~~~
Refreshing to see an actual defender, you know, defending. And more skill in attack with these players than Young or Valencia are capable of. 

Just please stay fit

472~~~
Showed today why we've been really missing him. Only if he wasn't crocked so often.

473~~~
Was very good in first half today. Faded in 2nd, but that was understandable given his fitness issues.

474~~~
So glad that he had a good game. Just needs to get his fitness up so he can play 90 minutes and needs to stay injury free. 

Our best RB is back.

475~~~
There is such an obvious difference in our buildup play when Rafael is in the game that it isn't funny.  He is quick, has good positional sense, and is decisive in what he wants to do with the ball.  Watching us with Valencia in the back today was painful, especially that shot he didn't take, one Rafa might have buried.

476~~~
It's amazing the difference he brings to the team. He HAS to stay fit. Please Rafa. We cannot handle more Antonio Valencia.

477~~~
The difference between Valencia and Rafael was so amazing ..... thank god he is back! Please for our sake, stay healthy.

478~~~
After some goal, I don't remember which one. Could be any of the second, third or fourth, Rafael was talking to Rooney about something. It seemed Rafa was talking about some issue with Rooney and Rooney was trying to calm him down or something. Did anyone else notice that? Does anyone know what that was about?

479~~~
Yeah I noticed that. Wondered what it was about. I remember Rooney back tracking to win the ball down Rafael's wing not long before that I think. Probably discussing something to do with that moment of time. That is just a complete guess though.

480~~~
When he's fully fit, he's one of the best players in the position. He's my favourite player, so very glad he stayed even though he's always injured. Seeing both him and Welbeck leaving might have been too much for me.

481~~~
Agreed. I thought he set the tempo for us initially too.

482~~~
was brilliant i thought, so threatening and with Blind anchoring midfield he'll get plenty more licence to go forward knowing he'll be covered
our play noticeably dropped when he went off, I love Tony V for what he was but he looked alien by comparison 
now just stay fit Rafa ffs!

483~~~
If only he can stay injury free.

Funnily enough, I think that Rafael would make a great right-wing back as well as being a good right-back.

We really need to find decent cover for him on the right though and that excludes Smalling or Jones or even Valencia.

484~~~
Our only right back.

485~~~
Looked a little rusty - flew in a few times unnecessarily. Still i thought he was good and will provide width down the right. 

I love how he gets so physical, and that he has better technique and vision going forward than Valencia.

486~~~
Spot on. 

To be honest I thought the criticism of him last year was pretty harsh. In a team that was absolutely dire he still added energy and tenacity and wasn't that bad given the fact that he was in and out due to injury. If he stays fit he'll make a huge difference to us.

487~~~
Was outstanding yesterday. Goes without saying that we need him to develop Evra levels of fitness, as he will need to play every game like Evra did.

488~~~
Luckily we don't have too many games this season and he'll have plenty of time to recuperate.

489~~~
Whenever Rafael is in the team, it gives such positive vibes.. I feel good about Man United. He has that effect!

490~~~
Seriously, how can you not love Rafa? He's so adorable and genuinely loves it here. I just hope he has another season like 2012/13 when he was fit and excellent throughout.

491~~~
Great interview and he actually means every word of it! South Americans are great talkers (and footballers of course) more often than not!

492~~~
Really pray he stays fit the whole season. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

493~~~
I love Rafa. Seeing him on the team sheet calms me, even though he can still be rash.

494~~~
<i><b><i><b>
</b></i>
More from the interview.

</b></i>
<b>
Such a likeable chap and hopefully future captain too.</b>

495~~~
5 aside with Valencia, what's he going to contribute?

496~~~
Good interview, is there any footage of Raf speaking English?

497~~~
I hope he stays here forever as well. There were rumours in the summer that he'd be one of the players leaving the club and I was dreading the thought of his departure. Really glad he stayed and let's hope he stays free of injuries so we don't have to suffer the pain of witnessing Valencia trying to make at attacking impact. 

His attitute is top class, it goes without saying really.

498~~~
I agree, love the lad. I've been harsh on him before, but his presence in the side really make a difference. Hope he can stay fit for the whole season now!

499~~~
He is a top fella. Great full back at that. Just stay fit will you.

500~~~
Great read and wears his heart on his sleeve. Makes such a difference to our play when he is on.

501~~~
Good read! Not sure about Valencia in a five-a-side but I'll forgive you Rafa <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

502~~~
Would be great to see him play his career out here.

503~~~
I think Rafael would make a great captain if he can stay fit. He's got that fire, passion, and emotion on tbe pitch that I just don't see from Rooney. How is his English?

504~~~
I wanted him to be made captain instead of Rooney. I'm aware that I'm in the minority there though.

505~~~
I think we are in the minority but we shouldn't be.

506~~~
Aside from the constant injuries he certainly should make VC ahead of Fletcher.

507~~~
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/rafael-for-captain.323398/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/rafael-for-captain.323398/</a>

Ahead of my time!

508~~~
I imagine he picked Valencia because of the fact that he actually worked really well with him in the past, often providing the attacking intent and great overlaps whilst Valencia did, well, nothing. Maybe cover him defensively.

509~~~
I'd love to have followed up on why he selected each player he did. Valencia is the last person i'd chose for a 5 a side, well maybe 2nd last after Fellaini. He also did not chose any of the new contingent, I imagine a team of ADM, AH and Mata + 2 would dominate another other 5 aside the team could muster.

510~~~
Hope he can back-up his good performance from last week. Leicester will be a tough away game and the back four (hopefully a four) will need to be good.

511~~~
Looking forward to Rafa becoming a key cog this season. I have to say I was worried for him when he didn't start against Galaxy and then got injured. Great to see he's fought his way back into the manager's thinking as he brings a lot to the team on and off the ball.

He answered a few fan questions on the Chevrolet FC YouTube channel.

This was almost two years ago, so his English is presumably even better now.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ix-shzuzhQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>pc

This was relatively recent. Imagine being a pro and having to listen to 'tips' from some snotty 'trick specialist' <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

512~~~
I cringed all the way through that one...
Then i watched a few of the other DHL trick challenge videos, and they're all pretty bad; except Fellaini's, he's pretty skilful!

513~~~
A bit of "steel"

514~~~
This guy basically sums up what I think a United player should be. Would love to see him stay injury free.

515~~~
Oh yes. While I loved seeing the new faces strut their stuff last weekend, it was brilliant too to see Rafael back and looking good.

516~~~
Does not have sufficient defensive 'nous' to play at full back.  Also wonder about his general footy intelligence sometimes.

Very harshly treated by Clattenberk - totally stitched up really.  But stuff like that happens to Raf, all the time.

And he does have positive attributes, but there are better RB's all over the place.

517~~~
Made no mistakes all game. Yet he "conceded" a penalty. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

518~~~
Was pretty good I thought tbh. Was never a pen

519~~~
Name other than Lahm? He's 2nd best right back in the world.

520~~~
I still worry his temper runs too hot when things start going the other way.

521~~~
Ludicrous sequence of events (blatant foul followed by a player going down very easily) but he still lacks composure. It was understandable back in 2010 when Ribery stitched him up when he was still very young but over 4 years later it is a problem.

522~~~
Royal screwed over by the ref. clear barge on him and gets nothing, Vardy falls over and gets a pen. He had another good game today. Defended a lot better as the game went on, especially up against lei tall striker. Very important 90mins under his belt.

523~~~
Not to sure if he was instructed to do it or not but all the times he made a bit of a run forward today, drew to a sudden halt and passed the ball behind him to a midfielder was annoying enough.

524~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This has to be a joke?

525~~~
Had a good game, one of our better players. Got screwed over by the ref. Let's not be too hard on him.

526~~~
Quite a good performance all things considered.

527~~~
When will Rafael grow up? Actually when will the defense ever grow up? Id say get 3-4 defenders and lets get rid of these inconsistent, overrated and injury prone lot.

528~~~
He's my favourite player, but he needs to keep calm sometimes. He's not the first player to make mistakes, nor will he be the last, but that was pretty stupid.

529~~~
Vardy half jumped back into Rafael just to double up the comedy crapness of Clattenberk but a VERY clever calmer player wouldn't have gone anywhere near him (which is harsh, but there we are)

also didn't jump with Ulloa for the 1st goal

530~~~
He was the only defender who gets away with some pride after today.

531~~~
He's been a friggin United defender for years. He should know that he can't retaliate! His mistakes are as shocking as his injury prone record. We need defenders who are mature and consistently good and not this shit

532~~~
Don't even blame him for a second for the 'penalty'. 100% Clattenburg's fault.

533~~~
How'd he relaliate?! He gets fouled by Vardy, gets back up and then Vardy dives for the pen?

534~~~
Idiotic post.

535~~~
Lets stop being naive he pushed him, not as hard as the non league level player did before but he did pushed him.

536~~~
Good player but I wish he cut out his moments of idiocy. It was a clear foul by Vardy so I guess he was unlucky but still.

537~~~
he was silly to retaliate. but even then it was not a penalty.

shocking decision for both. the orginal shove by Vardy was as bad a foul in that situation as I have seen.

how an official can change a game.

538~~~
I don't blame Rafael at all for the penalty.  He was firstly so clearly fouled, and then he did nothing other than race back to defend, and without contact Vardy went flying.  Hard to blame the kid.

539~~~
It wasn't a penalty offense but someone with his experience should know better.

540~~~
This. Rafael was fine today. That decision was dreadful.

541~~~
He was awful

542~~~
Got screwed over by the ref, but could have avoided it.
Blackett was there blocking the goal, and he didn't need to run towards the guy at the initial speed he did. Was wound up about being fouled. 

You wouldn't see Zabaleta do that.

543~~~
Same problem with him as usual, doesn't get something he should get, loses his shit. I was screaming after he was fouled there not to touch this cnut because he'd use it and boom, seconds later we're penalty behind. He was basically robbed by Clattenburg there but it's the same kind of story you could tell against that Munich match in 2010 or 11 it was.

544~~~
I disagree but if that is deemed a push then every game will have stupid pens.

545~~~
Not a penalty but he still wasn't good enough.

546~~~
When we say retaliate, are we talking about running back towards a forward bearing down on our goal, who throws himself to the ground?

547~~~
Don't blame him tbh, think he did well not to lose his cool. Could have done more for their first though hard to say if the players were caught out thinking it'd gone out. But the pen was an absolute joke by the ref and some of the other decisions against him were harsh too.

548~~~
It seems so.

549~~~
Vardy shoved his body into Rafael and went down. Vardy initiated the contact. Not today, not ever, is that a penalty.

550~~~
Where else is he supposed to run? Vardy was throwing himself in front of him.

551~~~
It was no penalty, stop blaiming him. He, di Maria, Falcao, Blind, Herrera are the only ones who had a decent to good game.

552~~~
It was evident that if he pushed the non league player he would get the red card. Clattenburg was waiting for any possible excuse to get this crap back in game. Rafael needs to grow up. He needs to become more consistent and he needs to avoid getting injured so much. If he cant then its time for us to get someone better

553~~~
agree. Rafael needs to grow up.

554~~~
Yes. People would be a lot happier if he just stayed on the ground or walked back into the area.

555~~~
Can't blame him for that clusterfeck of a call. Seems another case of a players past reputation determining the outcome.

556~~~
Sorry what the feck? What wasnt mature about his performance today!?

557~~~
Amazing that he's getting blamed for a shocking piece of refereeing.

558~~~
I agree with that, totally.

Edited to say, seems our fans are pretty much doing the same.

559~~~
Watch the gif. He literally does nothing to Vardy, Vardy shoves into him (in the box) and theatrically falls to the floor. There's nothing Raf could do.

560~~~
Yep. Rafael's literally done NOTHING wrong there <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

Vardy's playing for that pen all day long. The infuriating part is hell get away Scott free. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

561~~~
Well, considering Blackett was blocking the goal, he could have stood off, gone more to the right and cornered him off.
He gave Vardy the chance to go down. It's not like he's never played at this level. He knows players might go down easily if you go in behind them.

And if he was last man, fair enough - but he wasn't and he actually didn't have to go behind him. He could have done things differently and the outcome would have been different.
He had other spots to run to and a man supporting him.

Got wound up.

Doesn't take away from the guys dive or the ref's mistake, but again, you would definitely see someone like Zabaleta do it differently, so it <i>was </i>avoidable.

562~~~
He pushes him slightly. Mind it was a dive but Rafael should have seen it coming especially after that foul and Clattenburg obsession to get them back in the game

563~~~
He did absolutely nothing to warrant a penalty. He defended within the laws of the game. Nothing to do with retaliation.

564~~~
That is NEVER a penalty.

565~~~
This. It's not like Rafael pushed him, Vardy moves his body into Rafael's and goes down. I don't get how anyone can blame Rafael for anything he did in that incident.

566~~~
He fell for the oldest trick in football. The idiot.

567~~~
Watch it again. He doesn't push him at all, Vardy barges into him again in the box, then flops.

568~~~
He does push him slightly.

569~~~
He really doesn't. You see what you want to see.

570~~~
The usual bollocks about his rashness no doubt will be spouted now. I don't know how he managed not to tear Twattenburg's face off after that. 2 atrocious decisions in the space of 5 seconds. Completely laughable.

571~~~
If you know a player is looking for a pen in circumstances where one might be given - avoid any contact.  It is the most piss-poor of piss-poor decisons though.

572~~~
The other angle in the replay showed it better. Not sure if there is a Gif of that though.

573~~~
Especially when you have an agenda.

574~~~
Yeah, agree with that - but if he leaves the player to run in on goal and the player ends up scoring - he'd get slated as well.

He's lost his head in the past, but I really can't fault him for the refs feck up.

575~~~
I've always been one to criticize him for rashness, and take the fury of the fanboys for it. But I certainly only see a Clattenburg gift in this case. Ridiculous.

576~~~
Thought Rafa showed composure and maturity. People saying he needs to "grow up" but he has. The old Rafael might have legitimately given a penalty away but he didn't today. Hopefully LvG sees it this way too.

577~~~
You've been fouled and it's not been called, the striker is running into your box with the ball and you're desperate to get back into position. How, at any point, do you expect him to be thinking about whether a striker is "looking for it" or not? His first thought, should, and was rightly, let me get back and try to prevent him from getting a free pass across the area.

578~~~
Come on, everyone could see that the second he got up after being barged over he was going to go in clumsily.

he has a reputation for it, and I wouldn't be surprised if Clattenburg gave that penalty on that rather than what he saw. Which is not right, but whose fault is it for sewing the seed?

579~~~
He needs to control his temper. Rafa shouldn't have given Clattenburg the opportunity to give the pen, even though it was a dive.

580~~~
Yes, a reputation from 4 years ago. Clattenburg is a twat. He proper bottled the call to give the foul on Rafael, and should get demoted for a good few weeks because of it.

581~~~
Except he didn't go in clumsily?

582~~~
His reputation was the reason that was called as a penalty, not his challenge. Mud sticks, and he needs to do something to change that.

583~~~
All he had to do, was jockey him and let him cross it in, which was minimal danger.
Instead, easy chance to score, and it ignited them, and worryingly we couldn't hold off such a sh!T team!

584~~~
He's given the guy the chance to go down, so I'd say that is clumsy. And naïve.
Rafael all over.

585~~~
So basically you wanted him to leave Vardy to do whatever the feck he wanted, in our box?

586~~~
4 years ago? He's still reckless, or "keen" whatever you want to call it.

I still love him though, but I defy anyone who saw him get up after that barge to not think "sh!T, he's going to foul him here"

587~~~
let him cross it, off balance, left foot yes. Not much danger compared to a free shot from 18yards!

588~~~
He got the reckless tag from that champions league game against Bayern and ever since it's stuck with him.

589~~~
Anyone whos actually looking to blame him after that really needs their head checked.

590~~~
Felt for him for the pen. The push from Vardy was ridiculous, then he actually tries to avoid running into Vardy, who backs into him and falls over theatrically. That really changed the game, and turned everything on its head.

591~~~
There are heaps of incidents that are similar to the Rafael one where the player doesn't go down though. So unless all those other defenders are going in clumsily...? He got up and tried to pressure Vardy into a mistake. Vardy just fell over. Rafael did nothing wrong.

592~~~
He should have done better for the first goal but the penalty was in no way his fault that's entirely on Clattendouche's head.

593~~~
Aye, think on this occasion one can ave some sympathy with him being cheesed off too, having just been bowled over.  Still don't think he's a naturally good defender though.  Pouring forward at OT when the game's won, he's looks excellent.  And with better defenders around him too, perhaps.

Anyway, that's enough 'idiotic agenda' from me.   I'm off to write to the FA about Mr Twattenberk.  <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>.  And drink a lot of beer.

594~~~
That's how I saw it. I thought Rafael had a decent game. Most of their goals came down our left not our right.

595~~~
If you think that's the only reckless thing he's done you can't watch many games!

596~~~
People are blaming Rafael?

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

597~~~
They did. Rojo was pretty shocking today, and Blackett was to blame for several of the goals too.

598~~~
We'll have to agree to disagree on this.
I think the second he raced up and back at Vardy, the ref was on red alert to give a pen. Vardy was cynical, shielded the ball, got a touch and we were all cursing.

Yet not for one minute thinking it'd be that serious.

599~~~
I honestly cannot criticize him for what he did today for that penalty decision. I really do not see what else he could have done. Just lay on the ground after the foul? Imagine the bollocking he'd get.

600~~~
That 4th goal was outrageous.

It was a moment of, what's that f'cking massive hole in the middle!! Blackett, drop back into it for f'cks sake, don't just stand there neither closing the man on the ball down, or dropping back.

Real shocker.

601~~~
I'm not saying it is. The tag has stuck with him since then though, and whenever he commits a foul people just say it's because he's reckless.

602~~~
Enjoy mate!

603~~~
Funny thing was it was so predictable he was going to give away the penalty. I was shouting "don't react don't react....oh feck off!". That said the referee was absolutely shit.

604~~~
How anyone can blame Rafael for that situation <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

605~~~
No, I wanted him to track back even further and close him down on the right. But he shouldn't even be in that situation as he was fouled initially.

606~~~
When I first saw it in real time I thought he had reverted to the Rafael of old and lost his head out of frustration. He didn't though to be fair. It was just a truly horrendous decision. 

Vardy goes to shoulder Rafael and goes down like a sack of shit under minimal contact. I wouldn't go as far as to call it a dive, but it obviously wasn't a penalty. The really frustrating thing is it was just a much lesser version of the shoulder barge on Rafael that Clattenberg had just said wasn't a foul. The cnut.

607~~~
People saying he is blameless today and made no mistakes need to take their goggles off. 

What was he doing for the first goal? That goal should be stopped if he actually communicates or deals with it himself.

608~~~
Clattenburg made a huge mistake today, there's no doubt about that.

But that doesn't mean Rafael is completely innocent. He seems a really good lad and always covers lots of ground, but he's been culpable on far too many occasions. Should he have prevented Vardy from pushing him off the ball in the first place? Ref got it all wrong, but it probably shouldn't have got to the stage, deal with it before it goes in the box...

609~~~
The whole day is an utter pileup of mistakes.

I think it's one of those we don't over analyse and try and move on from asap.
Especially in the context of such an odd weekend where Liverpool, Tottenham and Everton have all lost too, the latter two at home!
Just frustrating it was a chance to make up a whole stash of ground, and be 2 points off 2nd!!

Gonna be a real odd season I can tell. City losing at home to Stoke was another.

610~~~
Seriously? Part of the reason people are getting so mad is because Rafael was fouled by Vardy. If Falcao did that to De Laet it would have been a free kick all day.

611~~~
Clattenburg had a shocker, but it's typical Rafael to be honest. He's 24 now and I'm going to put it out there that he's not of the required standard - he just doesn't learn.

On the first goal, he was on his heels and for the penalty, LvG was spot on - he gave the ref the opportunity to blow his whistle. His whole hustle and bustle, 100mph style in those situations just looks untidy.

612~~~
Pretty much this. I have some sympathy because it was unbelievable the ref didn't give the free kick against Vardy. A clear foul all day long.

But I just think he could have used his brain a bit more so he didn't give the ref the decision to make following that. If that means allowing him to cross it in this instance, so be it.

Any contact was always going to be a pen. Unfortunate though he was, I'm disappointed in his part in it too following the foul.

613~~~
He should have shown his experience, not that it was a peno mind you but the way he rose to rush to the forward was expected by the ref and the ref then bought the theatrical fall. Not his fault entirely but the collective collapse of our defence and how Van Gaal watched unfold was disturbing.

614~~~
This "he gave Clattenburg a chance" -talk needs to fecking die..  What the hell is he supposed to do? He needs to get close and has a right to challenge the striker and not be afraid that IF/when the opposition CHEATS, he has no support from the referee.  I think the first challenge was 50/50 at least which also went for the attacking player. Defenders have been cut dry when the plastic fans are just waiting for 4-4 results every week..

615~~~
Given LvG's post match comments I wouldn't be shocked to see TBT playing next week instead of Raf.

616~~~
People only think Rafael "gave the referee an opportunity" because it was actually Rafael himself. Like I said, he's a victim of his own reputation in that mud sticks. He didn't really do a great deal wrong, but because you, I, Clattenberg and a whole host of football fans saw him charging back thinking "he's going to dive in" then it pretty much makes up the referee's mind for him. Clattenberg should be above that, though, and judge the situation on its merit. He didn't actually dive in, nor was it a foul. His only real fault was his admittedly quite bulldog-like style of play. There isn't a great deal he can do to change that at the end of the day, and nor should he have to.

617~~~
Not convinced

618~~~
Poor decision from the ref, but Rafael give the ref a decision to make. Had he never touched him, the ref couldn't give anything.

619~~~
Very true and very likely the way Clattenburg processed to give the penalty.

620~~~
He got unfairly punished by Clattenburg.

621~~~
Wow. The first time I've seen the incident, that's a disgraceful decision. When I first heard about it, I though Rafael may have been a bit silly but that's ridiculous!

622~~~
Blaming Rafael for the penalty is pure lunacy. Watch the incident without thinking "this is Rafael, he's rash" and you'll quite plainly see he does absolutely nothing wrong. No, he doesn't "give the referee a decision to make", the referee decided to make a ridiculous decision all on his own.

The "any contact in the box is risky" talk is rubbish — there's 100 times that amount of contact during any corner/free kick; even outside of set pieces, there were about 20 incidents with far more contact than this in the box during the City v Chelsea match later on, and not one penalty. Attackers don't have a force field around them all of a sudden, just because Mark Clattenburg is completely inept at his job.

The most galling thing is, reverse the roles here and imagine Clattenburg had given us this penalty instead of Leicester. Is there one person in the world who would say "oh the full back has given him a decision to make, it's silly from him"? No, it would all be about how United are getting a helping hand from the refs again. Fair play to Jamie Carragher though, he's actually the only pundit who unreservedly said this was a ridiculous decision on both accounts (no foul on Rafa, then foul by him), and that it changed the momentum drastically.

623~~~
I love the guy but he played a big part in our downfall today. 

Was sleeping at the back post for their goal. Not helped by Evans losing his man and flight of the ball. 

For the pen, we all cringed as soon as he got up from that shove. Should've been smarter, but terrible reffing.

624~~~
For there first goal, all the defenders were at fault. Rojo should never of let him cross, Rafa wasn't close enough to the guy and evans was in no mans lands doing nothing. That's the only poorness of Rafa's display today. In fact in the second half when he was in the same battle with Ulloa, he put in a great header as well as some other vital headed clearances when they started hitting our box with crosses and corners.

625~~~
Am I the only one who wondered why the hell Rafa had to come all the way inside to track Ulloa for the first goal, when Evans was positioned two yards away?

Why didn't Evans take charge of the situation and get close to Ulloa? Didn't he expect Vardy to get to the ball before it ran out?

Poor defensive play (by Rojo as well).

626~~~
Have no idea but you would kind of expect the defender who was there (Evans) to take charge of it. Especially when he is ment to be the most experienced one out there now. Not sure if it was lack of communication or what but common sense tells you to get there ahead of the guy behind you.

627~~~
Was at fault for the 1st, the penalty decision wasn't entirely his fault, but gave the ref the opportunity and besides which his uncontrolled playstyle seems to be highlighted every other game, last week against QPR we saw the best of what he offers but I can't help but feel that I'd love a "boring" (less injury prone) Gary Neville type instead.

628~~~
That's how I saw it, and assumed it was the right decision based on Rafael's previous for that type of thing. I thought in my head he's going to give a rash pen away here. But....then I saw the replay, he didn't even touch the cheating diving fecker. Vardy throws himself back into Rafael and cons Clattenburg. 

Clattenburg has gone off reputation, which a referee cannot do when making a decision. Vardy is known as a bit of a cnut in the lower leagues anyway, refs will be on the lookout for this type of thing from him too now in the future, it's just a shame we are the ones to suffer for it.

629~~~
The attacker also moved his body to make contact with Rafael. Rafa only ran in a straight line. Awful Officiating

630~~~
He is not to blame for today.

631~~~
Every time I see that it gets worse. I'm struggling to think of 2 worse refereeing decisions in a the space of a few seconds. I cannot think of anything that bad in recent memory, I mean it's just so obvious. Rafael literally does not touch him. And the foul on Rafael is given 99 out of 100 times from refs who have their eyes open. A scandal.

632~~~
We dont get penalties when this happens... 
Rafa was fouled end of. Thought he did well today.. Clattenburg did bottled this all day..

633~~~
Am I missing a replay or something? Why are people saying he didn't touch him? He definitely puts his left arm in Varney's back. That's the contact which provoked the dive.

634~~~
yep I think it played a part in it. Referees seems to dislike Rafael, just because he is brasilian and surely clattenburg prefer rather vardy because his face is as ugly as his. I hate when referee tries to be a star on the pitch. This twattish bastard ruined our match, I don't usually make excuses and put blame on referees

635~~~
That gif does not tell the whole story though. He does put his left hand in his back....still don't think it should be a penalty. Besides Rafeal was fouled first.

636~~~
It was a rather poor decision from the ref, on both the shove and the way their forward lent in and then flopped over, but in fairness even with that penalty it would have been 3-2 I believe, we still utterly imploded, from a mental standpoint of our players it was very worrying.
Bizarre lunacy seems to follow Rafael regardless.

637~~~
The only reason Rafael's arm touches his back is that Varney slows down and throws himself into him (along with the classic hit your own feet together dive). If he carried on running straight they would have been shoulder to shoulder.

638~~~
So what's he meant to do?  Act like Nani and just lie on the floor complaining about the foul?

He did EXACTLY what he is paid to do.  By playing football you "give the referee a decision to make".

639~~~
What was he meant to do? Don't be silly. Like I said, poor decision by the ref, but that doesn't give Rafael the right to get up and make the same mistake. Two wrongs do not make a right. Rafael retaliated and we got punished. Simple!

640~~~
How did he retaliate? At most he grazed Vardy's back with his arm, there was no significant contact whatsoever. Vardy literally jumps into Rafael and trips himself to sell the penalty.

641~~~
Don't think the first call is too wrong by the referee, similar to Valencia's which we all applauded. The penalty call however is completely pathetic, worst "dive attempt" I've seen as he basically lunges himself half a metre side-ways to get in the way of Rafael and then he falls himself. 

Talk about seeking the contact.

642~~~
He give the ref a decision to make.

643~~~
Its a bit worrying that he's been here 6 years now and he's still making the same mistakes without ever seeming to learn. Ball watching, poor positioning and rash play is making him a liability. Not only that, but his ability on the ball seems to have massively regressed. Looks clumsy on the ball, is reluctant to make driving runs anymore and only hits a decent final ball about 1 in 6. Sarcastically dismissing every referee decision against him probably isn't helping his cause either.

Needs to up his game in a big way.

644~~~
You could say that about literally any defender within a metre of any attacker in the box ever. It's dumb.

645~~~
Even more 'dumb' when it's in the penalty box. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

646~~~
Really can't see how people are blaming him for the third goal. The only reason the penalty was given was because of Rafael's reputation. When I saw him get up and go flying right back to Vardy I thought he was going to end up doing something stupid but he ended up just catching up to him and then Vardy dove, not much Rafael could've done unless you would've rather he just stayed on the ground and not tried to recover.

647~~~
Any other player in the universe and this 'gave the ref a decision to make' bollocks doesn't get spouted for a defender running innocently back into the box.

648~~~
Anyone blaming Rafael for any aspect the 'penalty' knows feck all about football.

649~~~
What? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Do you understand football or even physics? Both players are running at full speed towards the ball at full speed when Vardy gives him a big push in the back - how would you do anything but go to the ground in that situation? Even if Rafael wanted to stay on his feet there's no way he could with a push in the back at that speed. He then gets up quickly and chases after Vardy, who jumps in front of him and goes down like a sack of shit while Rafael touches his shoulder ever so slightly. Even ignoring the free kick he should've had and his "history of retaliations" it was never a penalty, so blaming Rafael for anything in that whole incident is about as insane as Clattenburg's interpretation of it.

There's plenty of other defensive situations you can pick out and say Rafael should've done better, but he did everything right in this situation - including getting back on his feet instead of staying on the floor and having a moan, like many other players would (which, ironically, might actually have meant the situation had lead to nothing).

650~~~
He elbowed him in his fecking back. You'd get away with that in the Sunday league but there's always a risk you'll get punished when you're up against someone clever enough to make a meal if it. You see it so many time. Usually by defenders. Wait for a nudge in the back then flop over. Just a silly thing to do in the box.

651~~~
Guess our manager doesn't know anything about football then. 

Van Gaal

652~~~
I've watched the gif on the previous page on a loop for a while now and I honestly don't see it - if you have any other angle I'd like to see it. As he catches up to Vardy, Vardy throws himself in front of Rafael and in the process Rafael hits Vardy's shoulder. It's not like Rafael barged straight into his back.

653~~~
Nope.

Simply put, yes it was a foul, it should've been given and I doubt you'd even find many Liverpool/City fans who wouldn't say it was

However, once that happened Rafa let the blood rush to his head and that's what you blame him for. Everybody on the planet knows if you put your hands on someone in the box then it doesn't matter how easily the player goes down, the referee will ALWAYS give a penalty. More so when the ref considers that the defender has charged at the attacker after feeling like he's been done over.

If Rafa doesn't touch him then there's no penalty and we see what happens with the attack. Other players were getting over to cover and we don't know what Vardy would've done but either way there's no penalty.

To suggest a player cannot be blamed even 1% when he's just given away a penalty is grade A bollocks and you know it.

654~~~
The gif's inconclusive, was better angle on MOTD.

655~~~
Praise The Lord for this man.

656~~~
For a defender, he doesn't play with enough control (and I don't mean of his temper, just of his role on the pitch). He seems too much on the edge, of something brilliant or reckless. The anti-Neville.

657~~~
Running back into the box is one thing. It is ridiculously, beyond stupid to try and run into the box through the back of an opponent.

658~~~
Not true. What happens at corners then? Also, it's not like he grabbed the cnuts shirt, he only tried to give himself a bit of leverage. He didn't even grip on to the guy.

659~~~
Vardy decides to go down before that vicious assault from Rafael driving his elbow into his back. The reason Rafael's arm gently caresses his back is because Vardy completely throws his body towards him while simultaneously dragging his legs into each other to fall down. It's plain as day.

Yeah that would be a silly thing to do. Did someone do that in the Everton game?

660~~~
People here won't like it but Rafael will be replaced by the time next season starts.

661~~~
I was gonna say, if that's true then why isn't Martin Skrtel giving away a dozen penalties every game. 

Some utter rubbish being talked in this thread. Clattenburg made two ridiculous blunders in the space of about 5 seconds. He's a disgrace of a referee.

662~~~
Good thing he ran around him then right? Too bad clattenberg can't fecking see what was a clear dive. Rafael did absolutely nothing wrong there.

663~~~
Fair enough, hopefully I can dig it up at some point. Really don't feel like downloading MOTD to watch it!

664~~~
Corners are a completely different kettle of fish.

In the situation Rafael found himself in, if he touched him, Vardy was going down, referee was giving a penalty. He didn't have to touch him but he did and gave the referee an easy choice.

It's bollocks that referees give penalties like that so easily, but they always do. Players should be more aware.

665~~~
Don't worry it looked every bit as ridiculous as it does in the gif.

666~~~
I would be more pissed off if Rafael sat there protesting and had not chased Vardy back down. The blame isn't with him, it's with the ref.

667~~~
So would I but he didn't have to touch him.

I agree that Clattenberg has had an absolute mare and it should never have gotten that far but to completely absolve Rafael of the blame when he's given away a penalty is biased bollocks.

668~~~
"gives the referee a decision to make" seems to be the new buzz phrase of the moment. 

A dive is a dive.

669~~~
Look... way too many times we are having tyo defend Rafael.

Bottom line is this happens way too much with him.  I mean look at Rio.  Over the last five years or so Rio has averaged 1 foul every 5 games.  Rafael on the other hand has averaged 6 every 5 games.  

We need intelligent play, not the first attacker wanting to go down easy in the box.  like others have said Rafael has had a few years and I am getting tired of this situations always happening with him out there.

670~~~
All the "biased bollocks" in this thread is coming from those looking to condemn our own player for an incorrect refereeing decision and a blatant dive by an opposition player.

671~~~
Eh ? Rio was a CB and Rafael is a RB to begin with. And then there was Vidic partnering Rio.

All stemming even more from Weird LVG comments.

How can he ever be wrong ?

672~~~
No it isn't.

We're not suggesting it wasn't an incorrect refereeing decision, nor that it wasn't a blatant dive.

Fact of the matter is Rafael did something wrong as well which some of you can't seem to fathom because of your anger about the decision.

673~~~
Think ac#9 will be proved right. He doesn't seem like a LVG thinking-type player.

674~~~
He thinks Rafael makes a challange because he has not seen it yet. Great way to prove your point <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

675~~~
And yet many, many dives result in penalties given.

Referees are fecking rubbish, players should wise up and not give the attackers the chance to make a convincing dive. If Rafael doesn't put his hands on him then Vardy doesn't fall to the floor looking for a penalty.

676~~~
Yeah, and Nani did something wrong too for the Cuneyt Cakir decision. Guess LVG would have just blamed him for raising his foot too high without awareness giving the "referee a decision to make".

He was barged off the ball pretty much and then got up and went chasing and didn't even make much contact with Vardy who basically dove. Clattenburg basically was bent over to give that penalty.

677~~~
Once he had been fouled he got up and ran after him in that Rooney-esque frustrated/aggressive way where you think "Uh-oh, I know what's coming next" which allowed the ref to assume the foul once Rafa got close and Vardy went down (I haven't any it back since watching it live but it looked soft). Obviously the ref should be able to ignore that and see it for what it was but we all know that the body language, so to speak, of players going into challenges can be the basis for decisions. Particularly so in the box. So being a little smarter is what's required so that you don't give the ref the chance to make a mistake/give a soft peno.

678~~~
The fun thing is had he not tried to get back into position he'd have been ripped into as well.

679~~~
So our manager wasn't at the game? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Either way, if you spend a bit of time to read Van Gaal's quotes, he says Rafael allowed the ref to blow his whistle by making the challenge.

680~~~
I agree with all that, I simply replied to the original post which said 'anyone blaming Rafael for any part of that knows nothing about football' which is a bunch of rubbish.

Doesn't matter how much contact he made. If you do and the player goes over, referees give the penalty. It's just automatic, it's fecking rubbish but it happens. Like if you make contact with a goalkeeper in the box then the goalkeeper always gets the free kick no matter what contact was made.

681~~~
It's like that when it involves an English player going down. Had it been Costa, Aguero or whoever it would've been "he went down easily".

682~~~
Exactly

683~~~
At the end of the day, Blackett was there. Rafael didn't need to leg it in the striker's direction, causing him to have to completely halt with his hands up. Anyone would think that was Rafael's only option in that situation.

The referee messed up twice but the penalty could have been avoided completely.

684~~~
Getting back into position doesn't mean charging towards the guy, especially when the centre back's already covering his route to goal.
Having said that, it's beyond belief that the referee didn't give the free kick. Absolutely ridiculous.

685~~~
I am not going to go back and read all the reaction because I can only imagine what it's like. However, there is no way I am laying any blame on Rafael for the penalty.

First of all, the prior foul, can't dwell on it but yes, it was as clear as day. As for Rafael giving away the penalty, the only thing he is guilty of, is running with intensity, that's all. It's a simple case of referees not understanding football. Clattenburg saw him running with intensity and assumed he was set out to snap the striker, he made no contact which should result in a foul, the striker simply stepped across him and flopped over.

I understand the argument of a lack of experience or a brain snap and not putting himself in that position and that's valid but at the end of the day, the referee should know better, you can say Rafael should too but if a player loses the ball, I want to see him chasing back as hard as possible, so I'm not going to hang him for that.

Ask any player, stupid referees will give fouls for the way the defender chases the ball, not the actual contact and it's a real pet hate among footballers.

686~~~
Do you'd prefer him to slowly run away from the player?

687~~~
I hope LvG doesn't blame him for that and drop him.

688~~~

689~~~
Rafael was in no way to blame for that penalty. he got fouled initially, did extremely well to get back at Varney, who tricked the referee into giving a penalty by throwing himself at Rafa again under no provocation.

The referee is the only one to blame for that goal, the inept s***.

Also, I read somewhere in the press today that Hodgson should give Varney a call-up to the England squad. He wouldn't last 15 minutes against continental refs if he played like that.

690~~~
How can anyone blame Rafael, Clattenburg and Vardy had some kind of love story going on. Couple of dangerous tackles and clear fouls like that one. I was already furious before the penalty was given, if you don't think that was a foul on Rafael, you don't really understand football.

691~~~
Clattenburg obviously doesn't know what a penalty is either, is laughable how he was conned by a cheat.

This is Redcafe, they love a scapegoat in here. For me Rafael was not to blame, he was fouled & pushed to the floor, he got up & actively chased down his man. He'd have been slaughtered if he hadn't. It really isn't the lads fault the ref got 2 decisions wrong & Vardy cheated.

692~~~
When you look at Vardy in slow motion, it's actually a pretty bad dive. How Clattenburg gave it is truly beyond me.

693~~~
FFS if that was Young, Ref wouldn't hesitate to give him a red card.

694~~~
If that was Young it will be all over the media.

But it a plucky lad from a promoted team so he will get away with it.

Who cares, he will be back down where he belongs while Rafael will face better players who actually will play football.

695~~~
Aah but all those defenders that Young dived against 'gave the ref a decision to make'. You can't do that apparently.

696~~~
If he's got his left arm on his back then no he didn't run around him. Players know what happens when they make challenges in the box. Rafael should know more than most because he's done it so many times.

697~~~
Which Everton game?

698~~~
Can't believe that some people really believe Rafael was stupid. You can't be THAT afraid of diving. It was a particularly egregious example of a dive, and he was not looking to touch Vardy at all.

699~~~
Exactly.

700~~~
I am finding it really really difficult to comprehend how the push on Rafa in the lead up to the penalty was not given as a foul. If this was cricket you would be thinking it's a brown envelope job it was that bad of a decision. But then again Clattenburg has always been an inept referee.

701~~~
Rafael had a good game, no one notice that none of Leicester's attack came from the right side because Rafael was solid and then that hideous decision from the referee happened. Shocking. Rafael was just unlucky and shouldnt be at fault. First the foul on him and then Vardy trying to compete in the diving Olympics. But at the end of the day United were still leading after that penalty bt no leadership was happening in that back line, that was united's weakness.

702~~~
Read that phrase a lot in this thread and it shows a pretty poor grasp of physics. When a footballer is running at speed in one direction, how is it even possible to instantly propel himself the opposite direction? 

Of course it is possible, to slow down sharply. If that causes a defender to go into the back of him then that defender is too close. Same principles as one car rear-ending another in traffic.

703~~~
He's not propelled himself in the opposite direction, more sideways, and he wasn't going that fast anyway. You can see from the above gif that he slowed down and changed direction, threw himself into Rafael's path - which was not directly at Vardy - and went down like a sack of spuds. The only reason Rafael went into the back of him is because Vardy waited until he was close, initiated contact with Rafael and threw himself down.

704~~~
To be honest the penalty aside it was one of the worst games I've seen him play in a while. He had a constant negativity about his passing, which is something I've never seen with him. His final ball often fell short also. It is however my biggest worry about this lopsided 4-3-3 formation. On the left side You have Rojo, with Di Maria being a constant outlet in front of him. On the right side however you have Rafael on his own with Herrera inside. He's being expected to play as a right back and a right winger. In my opinion if we are persevering with it Van Gaal needs to instruct a striker to push to the right hand side when the ball is in that area (Rooney would be the best to do this I would say, with Falcao central and Mata behind).

The penalty decision was a complete joke though. I blame Rafael slightly for being naive enough to run directly behind a player and get far too close, particularly to a player who has just fouled him. However the ref was just dying to give a penalty, I don't think I've seen a ref blow his whistle for a penalty that quickly in years. I think if it was 3-3 at that point in the game Clattenberg gives a foul every time and would also have never given the penalty.

It carries on from the "don't spoil a game" directive that refs have clearly been fed (ie do everything possible not to send someone off in the first half). It now seems to have evolved into a "make the game more interesting wherever possible", where you are far more likely to get a ton of favourable decisions when losing. Unfortunately both these "directives" actively ruin games as we saw yesterday.

705~~~
Nothing wrong with that challenge, what was he supposed to do? Stay down and let the guy walk in our penalty box?

706~~~
I think this was his first full 90minutes since the pool match last season though, so he was always going to struggle/look a bit jaded. But I agree, rafa did not have any help in attack down the right at all. He was still solid defensively as every goal, barring the wrong pen, came from attacks down our very weak left side.

707~~~
To be fair he played a key part in our third goal. His attacking play was lacking overall though.

708~~~
I said to my dad as soon as we didn't get the free kick for the push on Rafael, 'he's going to push him back and concede a penalty'.  5 seconds later, you know the rest.

It's come to the point where you know what's coming, the indiscipline he shows week after week is shocking.  I'm not just talking about yesterday although it did annoy me a lot because the way he charged after Vardy it was so predictable what was going to happen.
He can no longer blame youth or inexperience, he's been at United a long time and failed to learn.  I would be looking for a buyer in January if I was in charge.

709~~~
Rafa at the moment is doing 2 man job playing with Herrera on the right who likes to go inside all the time when attacking and doesn't cover defensively enough with him.

710~~~
I did the same. Rafa needs a T-Shirt "Why always me"

711~~~
Varney said that Leicester knew we that our formation would leave our full-backs exposed, so they planned to take full advantage of that. Which was exactly what they did. We were tactically out-witted by a newly promoted manager. Which is a bit of a worry.

712~~~
Hold up there, Herrera has done more defensive job yesterday than Rafael did. Four tackles, three interceptions, Rafa had three interceptions and just one tackle. Just stats, I know, but they do show that Rafael didn't really have to do '2 man job'.

713~~~
And this all stems from trying to shoehorn in RVP, Rooney and Falcao.

714~~~
With one of those three players being absolutely terrible all season.

It's really concerning that he's a manager who has always been most comfortable playing a 433 but ended up spending 150m to create a squad of players that he is apparently unwilling/unable to use in that formation.

715~~~
Really joke of a player

716~~~
He doesn't slow down sharply, he looks to his right and then throws himself to the right, in front of Rafael.

Look at the GIF.

717~~~
Poor refereeing decision - pure and simple. Rafael was solid before that moment.. huge dive, like literally barely any contact. I'm all for absolving the blame of referees and looking at ourselves instead but no doubt it was a horrendous decision.

718~~~
Exactly. He doesn't "throw himself" into Rafael. He moves his body between Rafael and the ball. Basic stuff. Where Rafael fecks up is when he puts his forearm into Varney's back. As soon as he felt that contact Varney threw himself on the ground. A blatant dive and never a penalty when you look at slow motion replays. In real time it looked worse, though, and it was a situation Rafael could have avoided if he'd been more careful where he put his arms.

719~~~
Sigh.

Have your way, blame Rafael. He doesn't do anything wrong there, he tries to get back goalside of Vardy, who decides to throw himself into him and fall to the floor. That's not anywhere near a pen, it's as bad a dive as you'll ever see.

But I see you've decided to blame Rafael, so keep at it.

720~~~
Absolute bollocks.

He was assaulted off the ball and did the right thing by getting up and getting back to his man when the whistle didn't go, it was his job to get around Varney and goal side of him. He didn't "charge him in the back", he ran around him and as soon as he was even close Varney folded like a deck of cards, cheating the ref to a Pen and Clattenberg couldn't have blown quicker.

721~~~
You're not even reading my posts now. I said it was a dive, I said it shouldn't have been a penalty.

But yes, Rafael could have dealt with the situation better than he did. I agree with Van Gaal on this one. You obviously don't. I can live with that.

722~~~
Because of LVG's comments people are jumping on Rafa's back, the much larger error was made by the referee and i'm disappointed LVG didn't mention it rather than passing the buck to Rafa. 

I'm all for taking responsibility but Clattenburg's decision was truly unexplainable and should be held accountable and should have been highlighted.

723~~~
Van Gaal only commented on what he saw in real time, doubt he seen any replays on the incident.

724~~~
That cross he whipped in was really good. Still cannot believe people are blaming him here. The need for a scapegoat on this forum is amazing.

725~~~
He didn't put his forearm into Varney's back. He put his forearm to Varney's right arm, who then changes direction making his back face Rafa. Rafa at the same time puts his left hand up to show he's not doing anything and Varney then dives. The angle made it look like he put his forearm to Varney's back, but it didn't happen.

726~~~
How do people expect Rafael to run? With his hands behind his back?

727~~~
Exactly! And the referee made his decision in real time.

728~~~
He raised his left arm to try and get past Varney. That's what triggered the dive and that's the contact which convinced Clattenburg it was a pen.

Can anyone dig out the reverse angle replay they showed on MOTD last night? You could see the forearm in Varney's back much more clearly in that one.

729~~~
To me it looks as though he's using his arms to run faster, and Varny just moves in front of him to instigate the most obvious dive ever. Diving 101, go infront of player and fall.

730~~~
It was definitely a dive.

Re Rafael's arm. He raised it up to try and muscle his way past Varley, who went down like a sack of shit the moment he was touched. Like I said, the reverse angle shows it better. Without the raised arm, the incident would never have happened. If you put your arms on someone in the box, there's always a risk of something bad happening.

731~~~
LVG had not seen the replay when he was about the incident. I am sure when he watches it back with Rafa he will see that Rafael barely did anything wrong. What I didn't understand was G. Souness reaction in the studio. Kept saying how Rafa made a "Stupid, stupid mistake". I switched off the TV after that.

732~~~
How anyone can blame him for that is beyond me, what was he supposed to do, give him a free run at goal?
He didnt touch him, Vardy jumped in fromt of him, he should have been booked for diving. Clattenburg had it in his head that Rafael was going to retaliate after not being awarded the foul,  as soon as Vardy went down Clattenburg saw his chance and couldnt wait to blow the whistle. The only surprise was he wasnt sent off.

733~~~
Blackett was there to cover. I really don't think much would have come of it.

734~~~
Indeed he was. However he still had to do his defensive job and try put pressure on Vardy, he didnt tackle, block or trip him, in fact I dont think he touched Vardy.
The ref was conned far to easily by Vardy who knew exactly what he was doing, a professional referee should not be tricked like that.

735~~~
I never said he charged him in the back, I said he charged after him.  There is a difference.  There was a noteable aggression in the way he went after Vardy, like he'd been wronged and was out to get revenge.  There might not have been a lot, if anything, in his challenge on Vardy but you could tell as soon as he was back on his feet he was going to give away a penalty somehow.  Such indiscipline I can't recall seeing in any other Premier League fullback, certainly not ones that have played as many games as Rafael.  The guy just isn't good enough as far as I'm concerned.

736~~~
Sorry mate but you're wrong. Rafael has matured so much to when he first joined United. He's still an aggressive player which is vital in his game considering he's not the biggest player, but over the years Rafael has learned when to leap into challenges or not and its been awhile since he's done a rash challenge. During Bayern Munich game last year, one of the best wingers in the world Ribery struggled get through him and pulled off terrific tackles and Ribery started getting angry with him.

Anyways back to the subject, first off Rafael was fouled but he did looked frustrated when not given the foul, so he did rushed up to his feet but he tried to get in front of Vardy. Soon Vardy felt his presence and Rafael started shoulder barging him and being aggressive, he went down like a sack of spuds. Rafael wasnt at fault, just got cheated out which unfortunately is apart of the game. Throughout the game Rafael was doing really well, thats why most of the attack was coming from the left side as Rojo was struggling. At the end of the day, there was no leadership in that backfour. The real game changer came when Evans, the only experience centre back who has leadership qualities came off from injury and was left with Smalling... The back four just then fell apart and no one to pull it back because there was no voice.

737~~~
Just to add some positivity to the thread, his cross that led up to the Hererra goal was different class.

738~~~
I think his performance in general was good considering it was only his second game of the season.

739~~~
The last thing in the world I want is for Rafael to think its fine to do the same thing next time he's in the same situation. At the very least I want him to recognise that he's making it easy for punks to dive on him.

740~~~
I'm still of the opinion that Rafael's an absolute world-beater waiting to happen if he sorts out his rashness and injury issues. Thinking both of those things will actually come to fruition is hopeful, to say the least.

741~~~
It's more than a little concerning that you could say the exact same thing about three of our arguably first-choice back four.

742~~~
And with Shaw on the other side we could be sorted in that area of the pitch for years to come, we aren’t as bad off in defence as we have been lead to be believe.

743~~~
I assume the other two are Shaw and Jones?

I remain really hopeful with Jones, too, he's just been another unfortunate youngster that we brought in and decided to use completely out of position for the most part, a recurring trend lately it seems. Funnily enough with him his injuries are usually down to his bloody rashness so if he sorts that aspect out he should be alright. Rafael on the other hand just seems to be made of glass at times. I'm still holding out hope that one day all these talented youngsters will just 'click' and we'll suddenly have a great back four at our disposal, but I think that's a while away yet.

744~~~
Retaliated?  WTF?

That's insane... trying to defend your goal is retaliation now?!

He didn't foul him, so I ask again, what would you rather he had done?

745~~~
Agree with this, having a consistent back four was something Fergie was lucky to have for the majority of his United career. So far Moyes and van Gaal have not had that luxury, if we can get the injuries under control and get a settled back four, I truly believe we will be fine in that area.
Think about it, Rafael, two of Jones, Evans, Rojo or Smalling with Shaw on the left, not that bad is it

746~~~
Vardy bought the pen by throwing himself into Rafael and then hitting the floor. 

The thing that massively pisses me off is the inconsistency. First of all Clattenburg decides that Prison rules football is acceptable, and then a push 100x weaker get's called literally 5 seconds after the first. How can the standard change so dramatically?, I would absolutely love to hear the reasoning behind his decisions. If he think's the shoulder barge on Rafael was just "showing strength", then what was the challenge on Vardy?. 

I feel really bad for Rafael as he just keeps getting tarred with the same brush. People that think he is rash and stupid will use it as another excuse, but anybody with a brain can see it was never a penalty.

Just compare that to Diego Costa's foul on Dzeko that Atkinson was happy to laugh off, he was literally hanging onto him trying to swipe the ball away. Football is a brilliant sport, but when things vary this badly it is very frustrating.

747~~~
I was thinking about Evans and Jones actually. Arguably Smalling too, although he's more lack of concentration and injuries, rather than the rashness injury/combo.

I hope Shaw isn't prone to either rashness or injuries. At Soton he was very solid and almost never injured.

748~~~
Clattenberg is an egotist who likes to make eye-catching decisions. If he sends off a United player it creates a fuss. He's got a history of doing so. Rafael was an easy target. Shit decision, made to portray himself as The Big Man.

749~~~
Yeah you're right about Shaw actually, I just assumed you were including him in the potentially world class bracket. I'm a fan of Evans but he'll never be at that level for me, a very good player but never likely to be an especially great one. Nor Smalling really. I'm more so hoping we've found a gem in Rojo than anything. It would be a good start if we, you know, played him in the fecking middle of the defense.

750~~~
I can honestly say I've never seen Rojo play in the centre of defence, I'm hoping come the weekend we will see how good he can be there against a physcial West Ham side. All our hopes seemed to be pinned on him being a success in there.

751~~~
Rafael did not foul Vardy. Vardy started going down before Rafael even caught up with him and dived across his path. Secondly he would have also been slated if he didn't start chasing after Vardy. Vardy knew exactly what he was doing, he had a few yards start and could easily have outsprinted Rafael but he conned the referee. Nothing more , nothing less

752~~~
Not sure if this is true but shows the isolation he had yesterday. 

I do find it confusing that some forum members are basically saying you shouldn't track back for fear of the opposition player diving. How is that Rafa's fault?! You can't stop playing for fear that someone will cheat.

753~~~
In Vardy's post match interview he said that Leicester had been briefed to exploit all that space before the game. That graphic perfectly illustrates the acres of room behind our fullbacks for Leicester to run into. After conceding two or three goals in very similar fashion, you'd have hoped that the penny would drop and we'd do something to shore up our flanks. What's that they say about the definition of idiocy?

754~~~
244 <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Said during the game that Blind was playing too high up and we were getting far too exposed with long balls into their strikers. It happened the whole of the first half and obviously killed us in the 2nd.

755~~~
Exactly. I know the defenders are getting most of the flack but ultimately as a unit, we were poor and nothing was changed to combat that. Plus having 3 of very much the same players (Rooney, Falcao &RVP) playing in the same space, is leaving us exposed in those areas we looked poor in.

756~~~
I know. Crazy. Two of those players are more or less identical!

757~~~
They were all playing the same space, easy to think there was two RVP's out there <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

758~~~
It's probably worth remembering that those average positions look extremely similar to the ones vs QPR and will definitely look similar to a few games we win comfortably this season. It's not an inherently bad shape. We should have reacted better tactically after 3-2, though.

759~~~
Anyone else feel that if he had stayed down when Vardy shoulder checked him that we might have been given a free kick for it? I'm not blaming him for getting straight back up and getting on with it but maybe that effected Clattenfeck's thinking?

760~~~
Very similar to Lahm getting shoved in the back by Podolski when Arsenal played Bayern last season. Staying down didn't do him any favours.

761~~~
I know I was livid hearing that but when he spoke about it in detail, he did say the first incident was a foul and the pen was very soft so not sure why he said it was stupid in the first instance.

762~~~
I watched a replay of the match on BeIn Sports and Keown was calling Rafael an idiot, claiming he reacted stupidly after he didn't get the free kick. Kept banging on about how Rafael and how he's rash for the rest of the game too!

763~~~
Blaming Rafael for conceding the penalty is like when someone's wife gets caught cheating and you're blaming the guy for letting his wife cheat on him.

764~~~
Well seeing as he had Blind and Smalling covering IIRC, I personally think he shouldn't have made any contact. I also feel he should have went goal side of Vardy.

765~~~
Did he even have time to get ahead of Vardy, keep in mind he was getting up after a foul and back to his man. I thought he did not do much wrong, it was a fair contact shoulder to shoulder and the player went down theatrically having already made his mind up to dive.

766~~~
I can see the wisdom in going goal side if vardy would have beaten him to the ball, however, rafa clearly was going to be first to the ball and imo was clearly fouled, did well to get up quickly and get back in position and was undone by a total Ashley Young Hollywood dive. Absolutely without a doubt one of the worst moments of refereeing I've seen in a long time. Clattenburg should see red for that call.

767~~~
I thought what happened yesterday must have been crushing and hope he doesn't let in linger on his mind too much. He was rounding into some really good form and consistency while staying injury free (knock on wood). His crossing from the right wing has been a breath of fresh air after having to endure Valencia as a wing back for a while.

768~~~
It's a contact sport, you're allowed to touch opposition players. If you don't, you won't get close enough to a to even think about making a tackle.

769~~~
Me too. For this reason I hope LvG defended him a lot more in private than he did in public.

770~~~
You mean for the 1 game prior this last one? with it... making a grand total of 2 games total?
Regardless if he's to blame for that particular penalty/goal or not, this kind of situation is still occuring far, far too often with Rafael, who's now into his 6th year.

771~~~
It was occurring too often with Rafael, but I wouldn't include that situation with the others. As everyone knows, he did nothing wrong and barely even touched him. If it genuinely happens again, feel free to point out that flaw of his.

772~~~
I agree. I just feel there's a time and a place to come into close contact with a player, and although the Vardy's dive was ridiculous, I don't think Rafael had to get that close on that occasion as he had a sufficient amount of cover.

Also, as I said before, if Rafael went goal side instead of the blind side of the ref, maybe Clattenburg would have seen the tackle more clearly, instead of being influenced by the crowd and Vardy's theatrics.

773~~~
As soon as Rafael started chasing him from behind I said "It's going to be a penalty. Don't do it Rafa".

I watched powerlessly as the penalty was given as I knew it would.

Rafael has always been rash. A good defender doesn't give the attacker and the ref the chance to make a call there.

The push beforehand should have been a foul, but it isn't uncommon to get away with it.

LVG is right. Rafa made a grave mistake and the team never recovered.

774~~~
I suppose we're asking a just clattered Rafael to make allowances for Vardy being a cheating git AND Clattenberk being totally hopeless - which is harsh obviously. But also, it's exactly the kind of weakness in his game that we expect to see.  We are being harsh because of his previous, possibly a bit unfairly on this occasion.  If it was a one-off we'd probably be saying yeah, unlucky, and blaming someone else!  But you can't separate out, it being Rafael from an incident involving Rafael can you?

This also being just about the only possible excuse for twat-features with the whistle's 2nd decision and maybe why he didn't give the free kick in the first place. And that's out of order, for a ref to be thinking like that isn't it?  Naive to think it doesn't happen though I suppose.

775~~~
Hard to watch him getting stick for it tbh. It's Bayern all over again. Yellow carded when he himself should of had a foul and then a second yellow which was never a yellow. How he didn't get given the foul is beyond me, and the penalty isn't even a penalty either. Yes, as soon as you see him running back you think it's going to be given as a penalty.. But it never is.

Worst thing is, is can you imagine if he had been thrown on the floor and stayed there as they went on to score? You'd probably see a few comments like "Instead of lying there waiting for a foul that isn't going to be given, get back up!" And that's exactly who Rafael is, he won't stop fighting, he'll keep going. A brilliant attribute to have, and maybe something more players in the team need to have.. But it can cost you. It wrongly cost us this time though.

776~~~
So you think Raf should have ran past him or ran off the pitch, sorry but goal side? He was right on the line, so how exactly. Football is a contact sport, Rafael didnt pull him back, interfere with his legs nor impede him in anyway, at most his wrist brushed on his back, causing his legs to give way. Was a yellow for a dive all day long! No idea how anyone could see it any differently.

777~~~
We would have blamed him for not getting after him had he then went on to score, maybe staying down would have been the easy option for him . Credit where its due, he didnt lose his head, he just got played.

778~~~
Criticism Rafael is getting here is beyond ridiculous. People are bashing him cause he ran behind Vardy despite the fact he didnt foul him.

He gave the chance to the ref to call a pen?
Yeah he gave him a chance by running behind Vardy and doing absolutely nothing, not to mention he was clearly fouled before that.
 Rafael is to blame Clattenburg made up a pen out of absoulutely nothing, well he made it up from Vardy's obvious dive.. 

People are mentioning him being rash in the past and all but I dont understand what the f. that has to do with incident with Vardy..

And as fome posters have mentioned if he just stayed on the ground and didnt get up people would criticise him for that. He cant win.

He's been marked and people will bash him whatever he does, even when he does nothing wrong.
It seems some people cant wait for an oportunity to criticise him..

779~~~
Unfortunatley thats happening with alot of our players, Rafael, Evans, Rooney, RVP, Mata, Smalling, Jones even De Gea at times.

780~~~
Yep. For instance DDG. He's been getting flak (is that the right expression <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> ) for absoultely nothing or if you ask people criticising him which goals he could have saved they bang about  that he didnt even try to save one of 5 goals or whatever. 
Mata suddenly is the man we should sell.. 
Rooney is hated here its a old story...

781~~~
Its getting tedious now.

782~~~
Bang on. I was thinking the same. He lost his head and allowed his man to buy a penalty. He got totally played and not for the first time - the opposition know he's rash and liable to do something daft if provoked.

He was previously told he could leave by LVG apparently so it's far from ideal he's even playing for that reason let alone the fact that he remains a serious defensive liability. I would happilty sacrifice half his attacking quality for soemone who can simply defend properly.

783~~~
He's also very injury prone, you can't rely on him to actually be fit through the season, along with the other regulars (Jones, Evans, Smalling, Fletcher, Young), the thing is, on sunday, it clearly was a foul against him to start with and did little  else but race back only for Vardy to anticipate it, lean in and throw himself over, so.. "OK" I can understand why people are defending him, but.. you know what? I just dont remember this type of stuff happening with say.. a Dennis Irwin, who didn't have Rafael's pace or mobility, even technique etc, but.. Why does this type of bizarre lunacy keep happening with him? I'd kill for a Dennis Irwin type, the consumate steady eddy who'd be available for selection week in, week out.

784~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFmtjuIdL14?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Anything but a steady eddy... beast of a full-back, perfection.

785~~~
He didn't lose his head because he didn't foul the guy or use any physical aggression. You're just using his reputation against him.

786~~~
Jesus wept, it's one after another in here. Watch the bloody footage! Rafael did absolutely nothing wrong! Sorry, no, he didn't give Vardy an opportunity, the cnut actually moves into Rafa and falls to the floor.
There aren't many black and white incidents in football but this is one of them. 100% dive and feck up by Clattenburg.

787~~~
Nice clip.. lord I miss him, could play both flanks as well.

788~~~
I honestly do not understand this Rafael bashing thats been going on in the media and with some folk here.  The boy is class, hes rash I understand but this is the same bloke who kept Ribery quiet against Bayern Munich (until he got sent off after being provoked, a weakness we all know he has).

But against Vardy that was NOT the case!  The boy was manhandled off the ball in a blatant foul.  He ran after his man, and watch the video again, Vardy linked his feet with Rafael's and straight out DIVED.  No push, no tackle no rubbish.  That was a stonewall bad call by the ref, just as bad as the red card against Nani vs Real Madrid.

Fair enough our defense is crap, but this match was not decided solely by that.  This was a match of so many unfair referee decisions that demoralised a team that's crying out for a leader to rally them.

Unfortunately, we have Rooney.

789~~~
I like him, but there is definitely room for improvement if a quality right-back ever became available to us.

790~~~
Hindsight is gold. Rafael was clearly fouled, the ref let the game continue and Rafael did exactly what a pro should do. Stood up and tried to win the ball back. He did not foul the diver, and actually showed his class by getting the ball. The ref fooked it up royally, and its his 100% fault. If all players tried best to avoid potential penalties and physical battles inside of the box, then we would basically watch a totally different kind of sport, closer to  large-scale futsal than actual football. Clattenburg was inconsistent and very biased in his decisions or he was plain blind.

791~~~
Can't understand why we didn't go for Sagna on a freebie, that is unless he was dead set on going to city. Perfect cover for rafa and Sagna would've helped rafa improve his game too whilst filling in when rafa gets injured.

792~~~
This.

Close thread.  (Not really.  Just saying timdbro got it spot on.)

793~~~
Thought exactly the same. As soon as he was fouled and the ref did not give a foul, i knew Rafael will give away a penalty.

794~~~
For sure, next time I hope he sits on his arse and lets the defender have a free run into a dangerous area.

795~~~
It's natural to look for a scapegoat. This board even did it when we were winning three leagues in a row and winning a CL and making finals. After any poor showing Oshea would be destroyed on here being called a donkey and other things. 

We lost due to poor tactics, poor selection, and poor subs along with poor team defending and some mental mistakes on top of injuries.

As for Rafael, his cross just before Herrera's goal was fantastic. And after watching the highlights again, I was laughing so hard at Rafael pleading his case on the second penalty. So passionate and animated. I love Brazilians.

796~~~
He did nothing wrong. NOTHING. FFS!

797~~~
I can't believe anyone blamed him. Even if it wasn't a foul on him, he got back in position and didn't touch Vardy. Vardy looked round and threw himself in front of Rafael. Looking at what some of our players got for diving it seems quite funny that he's praised for it.

798~~~
The day could have been made better if he'd gone loco like Pepe on Vardy after he dived.

799~~~
The announcers jumped on the 'oh boy, he's being rash again!' story and many have unfortunately followed their lead. He really wasn't at blame IMO. The fact that Clattenburg and Vardy are basically escaping any judgment, and it's instead falling completely on Rafael, LVG, and United is fecking annoying and completely as expected

800~~~
Rafael did not lose his head, he got back into his position rather than staying down hoping for a free kick which would never have come. All of you criticising him for tracking his runner as he was supposed to do will then say - if he had stayed down - and Vardy scored for whatever reason he should have tracked him. Rafael can't seem to win with you lot can he? Its not Rafael's fault he was fouled and the free kick not given, nor is it his fault Vardy dived and the stupid ref was conned.

801~~~
It's like the fecking ocean tide on here. That's what you get when people don't watch the game. 

Absolutely retarded that anyone could put blame on Rafa for that incident.

802~~~
He did not have to sit on his arse, neither did he have to touch the player in the penalty area waiting for the slightest touch to go down. He did not attempt a tackle, he simply ran into the player, even if it was the slightest touch. What he should have done was try and get ahead of the player, or let one of the other defenders try and cut Vardy off.

803~~~
He didn't touch him though. And also, how the hell can he get ahead of Vardy who had barged him into the ground seconds before. That's a hell of a lot of ground to make up. You're asking Rafael to basically do the impossible.

804~~~
I beg to differ. The penalty call was absolutely wrong, but Rafael should not have let the ref make that decision. He did touch the player, but very slightly. He made enough ground on the player to touch him, he should have just let another defender deal with Vardy if he could not get ahead, or make a tackle.

805~~~
Vardy would have gone down regardless.

806~~~
Yeah and had he just let him go and they scored from that, you'd probably end up saying Rafael didn't even attempt to get back. He did all he could to get back and there wasn't a thing wrong he did in the situation. Clattenburg was keen to give the penalty and Vardy knew he could get away with it.

807~~~
Absolutely, he was waiting for that, but if he gave away a penalty trying to make a tackle, i could understand.

808~~~
But that's still stupid, because people would still be saying Rafa was wrong. You are basically putting him into a damned if he does, damned if he doesn't situation here.

809~~~
We are going to have a difference of opinion on this, but at the end of the day the defending for some of those goals were horrific. We just have to live with it and hope it does not happen again.

810~~~
Some of the goals (ie every other goal) yes, that one no - we were fecked over by the ref, that's all there is to it.

811~~~
Honestly, can we set up a poll to see just how many people think Rafael was AT ALL at fault for the penalty? Either lots of people are just repeating the tiresome media narrative, or they're all just congregating in this thread.

812~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Rafael's team-mate tales</b></span>
<i>In our exclusive interview on team-mates, United right-back <b>Rafael </b>talks about playing poker with Darren Fletcher and socialising as a squad...
<b>Who is your best friend at the club?I have some big friends here. </b>I would always say Antonio [Valencia] is the closest one but Anderson and Fletch are big friends of mine too. I have a lot of friends in the squad.
<b>
<b>Do you have a room-mate at the hotels?</b></b>No, we do not share rooms together but when we're sitting in the lounge at the hotels, we often have conversations. It's always nice to do that with your team-mates.
<b><b>
<b>Do you discuss tactics and other footballing matters away from the club?</b></b>When we are away, we do some other stuff, but of course we often talk about football. Sometimes, I go to Fletch's house and we play poker and talk about football all night! But of course we do talk about other things as well.
<b><b>
<b>Do you watch any other Premier League games together?</b></b>Yes, we do that when we are away. When we're at home, we often play video games but we stop to watch some matches together.

Do you socialise with the other players?</b></b>Yes, we had dinner together in Manchester last week. It is always nice when everyone is together. It allows us to talk properly as a team.
<b><b>
Was it Wayne Rooney's idea to get everybody together as a squad?</b></b>Yes, I think it was Wayne’s idea. He spoke to everyone about it. Now, he’s the captain here, he's doing everything like that.

813~~~
No surprise he and Valencia get on well. They have a good connection on the pitch too, Valencia always looks a better player with Rafa on his wing.

814~~~
Have not read back through the thread because I knew people would be going off their onion at him. Just on the topic of the podcast and 'rash' and 'naive' defending I can't see why that is naive at all.
He got up to get back and not shirk his defensive duty, is that naive? He went up to challenge in a non agressive manner barely making any contact at all, I just don't see that as naive.

You can't assume the referee is going to blow up in the box every time you have to defend. If you did that we'd never make any tackles in the box ever. 

I think it's harsh.

815~~~
If you watch the replay you will see Raf was trying to get goal side of Vardy. He didn't even touch Vardy until Vardy dived into Rafael. Nothing Rafael could have done.

816~~~
Been great so far. An assist and could of had another, with another good ball to Rooney. Dominating our right hand side and linking well with Herrera.

817~~~
Brilliant again!<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

818~~~
Fantastic again.

819~~~
The hate he was getting last week from the caf...

...such a star our Rafa. Been a fav since he fronted up Tevez in 2009/10. Love the guy.

820~~~
Great first half. Gives us so much going forward, looking composed at the back too.

821~~~
He's responded well to the critiques from last week whether anyone feels they were warranted or not, he already is growing into a good understanding with Herrera.

822~~~
Super half. He'll bag a lot of assists if he continues with his great crossing. Been a joy to watch.

823~~~
Great going forwards and just adds so much danger to our attack.

Now if he can keep his cool on the other end and not make any errors.

824~~~
Very good today, in both ways.

825~~~
Excellent performance again.

826~~~
Didn't get as forward as much this half, obviously after the red but at the back was solid. Did not let anybody in at all. Also looked like he took control of the defence after that as well. Saw him instructing Rojo and the rest. Always full of energy. My MOTM.

827~~~
Best player on the pitch today I thought.

828~~~
I bet he's been livid with himself all week even though he did absolutely nothing wrong. More than made up for his 'mistake' today. Was excellent.

829~~~
He didn't need to redeem himself as he was unlucky last week but nonetheless he assured that the mistakes were not going to come from his side of the field today. He's the best right back in the PL when he puts in performances like that.

830~~~
Shades of 2012/ 2013 Rafael in the last few games. Has struck up a great understanding with Herrera down the right side. Just needs to keep fit now, absolutely vital to our performances. The drop to Valencia is significant.

831~~~
MOTM today.

Brilliant going forward and was covering all over the place 2nd half too and got first too so many clearances.

Blind fecked up towards the end but Rafael tracking Nolan across at the LB post saved us.

832~~~
The guy is absolute class. Let the morons in the media have their lazy preconceptions. The lad is a gem, and still my favourite United player despite some good additions this summer.

833~~~
I felt there were moments today where you could finally see that little bit of restraint from him that we've needed, shielding and shadowing as opposed to lunging and charging and trying something that has a 20% chance of not losing us possession, felt he led at the back, love him! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

834~~~
Absolute beast. The difference between him and Valencia is a world apart. My MOTM.

835~~~
A great competitor

836~~~
He was fantastic today. He has a great leap on him as well, won so many important duels just outside our box.

837~~~

838~~~
Was more impressed with his second half. We knew he can attack and did so in the first half. Thought he was composed in the second half which helped our defence of the 2-1 lead.

839~~~
He showed two different sides of himself today. 
First half he was brilliant going forward a kept on getting past his player.
Second half we had to defend a lot more and Rafael showed that he is not just about attacking and defended his side very well.
Easy MOTM for me and hopefully he can stay injury free now and we will have a very exciting player in him.

840~~~
I absolutely love him, immense today. Glad he bounced back from being on the end of a poor decision last week

841~~~
Great game from him again, he's started the season well. He's always been class whenever he's stayed clear of injuries, going forward and linking with the players in front he's always been brilliant, has a great cross on him too. Defensively in 12/13 he was very good and consistent as well. Great to have 2 fullbacks like Rafael and Shaw, hopefully they stay fit. We're a completely different team with him in the side.

842~~~
It's amazing how much better going forward he is than Valencia and Young. That said, when we're camped just outside the box and he has to track runners and cover areas he still makes a lot of mistakes that you'd hope he'd have ironed out by now. Shaw is clearly a much better defender.

843~~~
He has an excellent pass in him to get out of our half. 

Today he showed that he's one of the best. Now he need to bust out the cotton wool and wrap himself snuggly.

844~~~
Probably one of our best players today

845~~~
Superb display from Rafael. 

MoM

846~~~
So potent going forward. He and Ander are making that right hand side real devestating. Just when you start to nullify di Maria on the left side, you've got these two with brilliant interplay and agility.

847~~~
Going forwards he is one of the best right-backs in europe when on form.

848~~~
If only we can manage a strong consistent CB pairing, the fullbacks can be brilliant going forward like the matches we know of.

849~~~
Superb performance. Terrific player, who has pace, grit and technique. MoM for me tonight.

850~~~
Cannot honestly believe Charlie Nicholas slated both of our full back as struggling today & once more accused Rafael of being rash & diving in? What game was he watching? Excellent performance from Raf once more, my man of the match, hope he gets a good long run in the team.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/teams/manchester-united/9492237/manchester-utd-v-west-ham-nicholas" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/watch/vid...ed/9492237/manchester-utd-v-west-ham-nicholas</a>

851~~~
Lazy analysis is part of football sadly. Excellent today

852~~~
He is exactly the kind of player you'd want when you are down to ten men, and today it was effectively nine given how spent Van Persie was. Him and Shaw were superb, if he stays fit he will have another very good season.

853~~~
Misses Ferdinand in that respect, Rio was great at directing him about.

854~~~
I like how he was bombing down the right and his assist for Rooney was great. 

One of my favorite players, I like how he gives his 100 percent every time he plays.

855~~~
Idiots on the SSN panel (Merson etc) were saying he was poor against Leicester and that they bet we wish we had kept De Laet. feck off. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

856~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

No, they did not say that!

857~~~
Wtf ? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

858~~~
They were banging on about De Laet only playing four games for us and how good he was against us. I think it was Stelling who popped up with that comment about us wishing we had kept him. It was either Merson or Charlie Nicholas (or both) saying Rafael was poor against Leicester whilst gushing over De Laet.

859~~~
With him and Shaw we have very good full backs for a long time. He is around like forever now and he is still only 24. He is very good on going forward and i am ashamed that i thought LVG will prefer Valencia to him. Just pray to God that he will stay injury free.

860~~~
Jesus. How can someone be that stupid?

Gushing over someone who should have been sent off in the first half and criticizing Rafael who got done in by the ref.

861~~~
That's just so infuriating. I can't get this worried feeling out that in big games, he'd have fecked up again with his rashness.

862~~~
Excellent again today. I'll never lose faith in Rafael, injuries or not, he's my favourite player by some considerable distance. Most of our good passages of play today came through him, and he was brilliant defensively as well. 

A few weeks back someone on here posted that he wouldn't make any difference to Valencia and that he'll struggle going forward this season without a winger in front of him but they couldn't be more wrong, he's flying. Him and Herrera have struck up a good little partnership on that right side as well. Both intelligent and instinctive passers. 

Love Rafa to bits, him staying fit will make a massive difference to our season.

863~~~
If he had stayed injured free, could he have been the best right back after Lahm today?

864~~~
MOTM. Did his job when we were struggling and he was suburb going forward with eleven men.

865~~~
I love watching him bomb forward. He's just fantastic to watch.

866~~~
His post match interview on MUTV was great as well.

867~~~
World class on his day, no doubt about it. Please stay fit..

868~~~
<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/tdU0NcNV0Q/embed/" width="612"></iframe>
Text reads: Thanks for your support you are the best. nothing like a day after another very good team performance.

869~~~
He matured alot with his positioning and in decision making. He also got better in passing massively not afraid of difficult ones and through balls and they are quite well weighted sometimes! playing with his head up that was the reason he found rooney twice in the box. The first pass was excellent almost Nevillesque. The second rooney couldnt convert. I like him that much that I will go and buy his shirt, definitely my top 3 fav player in the team if not the number1

870~~~
Well done lad very good performance. Lovely cross for the first goal.

871~~~
yeah and his knee slide was in sync with rooneys so it was a great celebration

872~~~
Loved his performance today, great to see him encouraging and helping McNair all game too.

873~~~
Great display. Again proves that he can make the difference in a positive display.

874~~~
Best RB in the league when fit?

875~~~
How does Valencia not learn watching Rafael play? This is what he should have done when he playing as full back. Thank feck Rafa is back.

876~~~
My love for him might cloud my judgment but I think so. Obviously now there is great competition for that honour and currently on form (last season and so far this time) there are more deserving RB's but I think when Rafael performs like that, he is on par with Zabaleta.

877~~~
Was brilliant! I love him. Easily my man of the match.

878~~~
He is the one United player I feel compelled to defend when fans of other clubs inevitably start slating United players. They can say what they want about anyone else, water off a ducks back to me. But Rafael, I dont know, I have to defend him. 

Some of the stick he gets is absolutely harsh and seems to stem from isolated incidents 3 or 4 years ago. He is a brilliant RB and the 2nd best in the league in my opinion, behind Zabaleta. He is a right footed Evra, right down to the love and passion he has for our club. And guess what, hes the same age now as Evra was when we signed him. Just about to come into his peak years.

879~~~
Except he's made of glass.

880~~~
He has been great since he came abck from injury, his crossing is quality.

881~~~
How was Evra's injury record in his years before he joined us? I don't know. Maybe Rafa can finally 'grow' into his body, so to speak. Hopefully.

882~~~
Great preformance from him today. This is the Rafa i like watching. From where i was sitting in the stands he was very disciplined in both attack and defence. Totally different from the Leicester game where he was out of position a lot because he constantly bombing forward and rash in tackles.
Today was a more mature Rafa but still played with the same enthusiasm. Good stuff.
The team as a whole were more disciplined positionally from start to finish especially Blind, every time he was pulled out of position covering a player he'd wait till he got back, get him let him take over and went back to his position. Today we saw LVG training and philosophy on the pitch, impressed with the change since Leicester, the player have a better understanding of what's expected.

883~~~
It was just as it was at United. He was a constant presence at Monaco. Im with you, one can only hope, but a lot of injury prone players struggle with fitness all their careers. Maybe LVG's new fitness coach will put an end to the rot.

884~~~
That would really go some way to improving our defensive performances, some consistency in selection back there, the chance to build up a defensive unit would be hugely beneficial.

885~~~

886~~~
We should re-sign Fabio in case Rafa gets injured again...a clone-like replacement!

887~~~
Spare parts.

888~~~
Good idea, Fabio's hair has always been better, we should start there

889~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Evra#Career_statistics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Evra#Career_statistics</a> Almost looks like 13 injury free seasons in a row, that. Freak.

890~~~
'kinell

891~~~
Yeah Evra was bit of a freak athelete.

892~~~
I expect he played through the pain barrier a few times. Something I think a few of our current defenders could learn from. 


Stiff legs. Give me a fecking break.

893~~~
If he could manage to stay injury free I think he'd be my choice for captain, he plays with so much passion and attempts to lead by example. He has a fantastic attitude, probably my favorite player currently now that Welbeck is gone.

894~~~
Good game from him.  More of the same please before your next injury hiatus.

895~~~
Very good first half yesterday.

896~~~
Definitely. Remember that story where his foot was fecked at Monaco so he put a chicken fillet in his boot, I assume to cushion him when he ran. Reckoned it was cooked through by the end of the game!

897~~~
I think it was in last 2 years of SAF we were playing either Mardid or Bayern, I forget, he was supposed to be marking either Ribery/Ronaldo and most people thought he would struggle, all I remember is he proved many people wrong that day, and really impressed

898~~~
Bale during his best season ever didn't get a look in until he changed to a more inside position, same with Ronaldo in the game you're thinking of, Rafael had the worlds best player in his pocket all game until he came in field.

899~~~
There are some idiots in the thread with an obvious agenda against Rafael. They do it subtly, with their, 'I've already said it's a dive, but if only he doesn't put his hands across, he won't give an excuse' when they had nothing to go on. It's alright if it's isolated, but it's tiring when it's done continuously. Obviously, he'll have off games and he'll make a mistake and let a goal in sometimes, but who hasn't? The fact is, we are a different team with him on it. He's so much better than Valencia or Young that it's unreal. I wouldn't swap with him for anyone on this league.

900~~~
I don't understand how anyone could have an agenda against it. The guy's proven to be one of our most consistent performers over the last couple of seasons (admittedly when fit) and wears his heart on his sleeve every minute he's on the pitch.

901~~~
He was fantastic yesterday both defensively and going forward. He seems to be thriving in the additional space he has to run in to right now since we are not playing any wide player on his side. His commitment and drive is a joy to watch. Really hope he stays healthy this year as he is one of my favorite players.

902~~~
He is also an incredible crosser of the ball and now when he is allowed to bomb forward and cross it will show how good this aspect of the game is. He always look up and usually cross it where it should be crossed not like Valencio who just came to the wanted position and hit it hard ... in the opposition player.

903~~~
My MOTM on Saturday.

904~~~
Keep up the great work, Rafael!

905~~~
agree. his crossing when on form is 2nd to di maria in terms of accuracy and quality.

906~~~
My favourite United player by a mile.

907~~~
Its very very erratic. When he gets it right its excellent, but theres still an awful lot of poor crossing from him.

908~~~
Why is he not called up for brazil national team yet?

909~~~
I think his frequent injuries has prevent the national team taking a good look at him.

910~~~
Thankfully.

911~~~
No winger in the game beats him 1 on 1. He's not the fastest player around but he can decelerate & change direction very quickly due to having a low centre of gravity and then strength wise, he's quite a tough cookie.

The only time someone may beat him is if he is caught out of position or aerially but no wingers will knock it past him and beat him on the outside.

912~~~

913~~~
He actually out jumped someone taller than him in the game if I remember correctly.

914~~~
If the stories are true with regards to Rafael not being in Van Gaal's plans a few weeks ago, then I'm disappointed in Van Gaal, especially when we were playing three at the back. Rafael is exactly the type of player you want playing at wing-back.

915~~~
Does it all the time, I remember him out jumping Andy Carroll a few times

916~~~
I still find it hard to believe he was in any serious danger of being sold, maybe Van Gaal was challenging him in some way but the idea of him leaving while we weren't being linked to a replacement as far as I recall just seems strange. He's a far better option at right back than Smalling or Jones so why would Van Gaal leave us short a true right back when we're so short elsewhere in defence?

917~~~
Because we were going to play without right back and van Gaal seemed to prefer Young and Valencia as wing backs. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

918~~~
I think it is because of the Olympics mistake, and because Brazilians coaches are stupid as feck.

919~~~
Because of the fallout from the 2012 Olympics. They blame him for not winning in the final. Admittedly, he was at fault for Mexico goal right at the start but on the whole, he was up there with Oscar, as Brazils best players at the tournament. Defended well, scored a well taken goal but they would rather stick with Maicon as back up to Dani Alves for the WC. There loss.

920~~~
Might have been something in those rumours of Van Gaal doubting Rafael's mentality and development over the last few years so. I thought he was good this weekend, certainly much improved over his recent struggles.

Should give us a good balance as a wing back if we go that route, just as long as he can control himself and learn to use his brain more on the pitch.

921~~~
One of my favorite Rafael moments was him outjumping Andy Carroll in a match against Liverpool

922~~~
Don't believe for one second that Raf wasn't part of LVG's plans. Calling bullshit on that one.

923~~~
Good article.

924~~~
Mitten wasn't hugely reliable in the summer, he even said we were trying to sign Schneiderlin on deadline day. However, I can see LvG selling Rafael and wouldn't be too surprised if the story was true - same with the Mata rumours.

925~~~
Wish we had pulled that off. Suited to English football, a better athlete than Carrick, fitter and stronger than Fletcher and would allow Blind to be solid backup in a number of positions.

926~~~
But there is no logic to selling Rafael. We don't have any back-up - at least no decent back-up, anyway - and there are hardly any better, available RBs elsewhere. On his day, Rafael stands up with the best in the league.

927~~~
Nice to see some praise for Rafael and credit for previous good form that seemingly skipped tool boxes like Savage and his Ingurlish pundit buddies.

928~~~
Why do you see him selling Rafael? Who is the alternative?

929~~~
I agree but it's LvG, who knows what he has planned?

930~~~
It was. He's becoming a proper little leader.

931~~~
On Soccer Saturday the conclusion was that he was rash and struggled. I seriously question what they were watching. He was excellent in both halves. In the first half he drove us forward and was full of attacking intent. His link up play was brilliant and he created chances. In the second half he was the first to realise that if we were going to win the game we needed to dig in and fight, and he led by example. Two brilliant sides of Rafa in one game. Future captain.

932~~~
Crying himself to sleep after the Leicester shambles makes him a leader? <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

 Keano would be spinning in his grave.

933~~~
The only way I see LVG having told Rafael he can leave is because of his injury record. If he did say that (which I doubt) it would have been along the lines that he plans on bringing in competition for Rafael in the form of another very capable RB, but no doubt one who has a better injury record.

LVG gave a few players the choice of whether they wanted to go or spend a lot of time on the bench, right? For all we know there could have been a RB option he was pursuing that never came off.

934~~~
Can he be captain in the next 3 games?

935~~~
Hopefully.

936~~~
Maybe Coleman ???

937~~~
Hopefully, you are being sarcastic

938~~~
Coleman is excellent, prob the fittest player in the league and was definitely the best right back last season. I believe he signed a new deal not too long ago though.

939~~~
When did we start signing the bestest players from the previous season? Rafael was the best in the previous year.

940~~~
Cow in another field. How well is Coleman doing defensively now Everton are playing a more open brand of football. Don't deny he's good but those who would have you believe he's much better than Rafa are over egging it.

941~~~
A player who hasn't played in the European competitions, not having to juggle between different styles of refereeing. We can't wait to shoot down our players here.

942~~~
I don't think he's been too bad, only played 90 mins 3 times (2 of them against Chelsea and Arsenal), 1 goal, 1 assist and 1 clean sheet. I think their defensive problems are more down to Howard being awful, Distin finally ageing and Jagielka off form.

943~~~
The issue shouldn't be just a straight comparisson with Coleman when on the pitch, the big issue with Rafael is just how often he's available for selection and how often he's able to complete 90mins when comparing him to Seamus Coleman or any other RB, in totality of what they offer.

944~~~
He's injured all the time just like Rafael though. Or at least it feels like that

945~~~
Its all about opinions , i fit rafa with a run of injury free games is top class and if he could curb the red mist he would be one of the first on the team sheet .
I was just answering the question someone posed earlier . In my opinion seamus Coleman is one of the best right backs in the premier league . Although he as not had the best start to the season by his standards going off evertons start but I'm not sure if hes been playing or not . Last season he was terrific though what I saw of him .

946~~~
He would have played in a European competition last week if he hadn't got injured.

947~~~
Let him play a season before judging then?

He's one of the first names on the team sheet right now, when he's fit. If both are fit and on top form, I'd pick Rafael 100 times over Coleman.

948~~~
Played 3200 league mins last season in comparison to 1300 for Rafael.

949~~~
Is last season really a good comparison? It's clear Moyes wasn't into Rafa, even when he was fit. 

I'm guessing Rafa wasn't much into Moyes either...

950~~~
I'll judge him on the league and international football. I wouldn't judge Rafael a poor player because he's not in Europe this year either.

951~~~
Rafael is a proven player in Europe and the League, while Seamus Coleman is not. He's a fine player for Everton, but there's no guarantee that he can make the step up for United. Look at Fellaini. 

You can judge him in whatever way you want to, I'll just be thankful that you are not picking the team then.

952~~~
Fellaini couldn't adapt to a different role here, Coleman would have the same role so I doubt there would be any issues there. We've had plenty of successful signings that weren't proven in Europe so I'm glad you aren't picking our signings.

953~~~
Are you Irish by any chance?

954~~~
Coleman is every bit as good as Rafael, and not nearly as injury prone.

955~~~
Yeh like I said rafa when fit is top class but I think if you put Coleman and Rafael up for sale then Coleman would fetch the biggest transfer fee irrelevant on who who is the better .

956~~~
I've watched him play for Ireland alright and he's done well but no I'm not Irish.

957~~~
Coleman better than Rafael? Yeah, alright then, I suppose Howard is better than De Gea too and Mirallas better than Di Maria, while we're at it.

958~~~
Very good player, but I would disagree.

959~~~
Anyone who watched Everton over the last 18months would be blind not to see how decent Coleman has been for them, consistently as well, I've no clue who'd be a better fit for us, but I know I personally don't trust Rafael to be fit week in, week out.

960~~~
No, but Coleman is probably better than Rafael though. Coleman was the best right-back in the league last season, alongside Zabaleta. I like Rafael, but he is massively overrated on RedCafe.

961~~~
That's fair enough, but you'd be in the minority. Ask most Premier League fans who they'd prefer and you'd see it'd be a lot more one sided than you'd expect.

962~~~
But couldn't the same be said of Rafael before the reign of terror was unleashed upon us ?

963~~~
Ferguson's final year Rafael was great, absolutely. Was he as good as Coleman last season? I wouldn't be too sure to be honest, Coleman was am absolute beast both defensively and offensively. I like Rafael, and I wouldn't go all out to replace him with Coleman as there wouldn't be enough an improvement to justify any fee... But Coleman is the superior right-back, for me and many others.

964~~~
Fair enough, I would agree with the assessment of Coleman being a notch above Rafael for about 18 months now. But ideally if we were to sell Rafael due to fitness concerns, I'd like someone who's undeniably world-class. Not sure if Seamus belongs in that category but then there aren't many quality right backs around these days apart from Lahm so it's slim picking. Dunno TBF. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

As an aside I'm stunned by the general press reaction and commentary to Rafael's penalty vs Leicester and De Gea's odd errors this season. Might be wrong but it just smacks of partisan behavior and repeating the tedious established narrative of Rafael being exceptionally rash and De Gea being soft when dealing with crosses. Didn't they see the latter's performances last season. The former conceded one penalty. Not having a go at Coleman but didn't he score an own goal vs Chelsea at a pivotal time ? Yet no one harps upon that. Then again maybe I'm just being paranoid.

965~~~
if rafael was able to stay fit id have him close to the top of my ,ist for the captaincy.

966~~~
Rafael generally doesn't get the praise he sometimes deserves, and finds himself scapegoat at times. As for de Gea, well he was absolutely slaughtered when he first arrived, I think Ogden wrote that it had shown how far de Gea had come that not much had been made about his mistake on Saturday.

967~~~
It's between him and van Persie for the next three games anyway, assuming Fletcher remains benched.

968~~~
Same could be said of Rafael the year before, and there wasn't much between them (Coleman last season and Rafael 12/13) IMO. Rafael links up better with his winger and has a better cross I think while Coleman is more of a powerful runner probably. Both excellent fullbacks but I think Rafael has far more potential if he stays fit, but that's a big if. He's also a few years younger.

969~~~
I'd definitely rate Rafael 12/13 better than Coleman last season, because he played in Europe against better players. Rafael definitely has issues with injury and that would be the only thing I'd hold against him.

970~~~
I'm not sure about that, unless they are all Irish or they must have short memories.

971~~~
I swear Seamus Coleman has family members on the Caf.

972~~~
As does Rafael.

973~~~
Coleman is defensively solid, consistently healthy and likely has a higher motor but Rafael I think has a lot more quality especially going forward.

974~~~
He played better players in the 2 ties against Real Madrid but the group stage was Galatasaray, Braga and FC Cluj which doesn't outweigh a full season of excellence from Coleman last season.

975~~~
I'd rather be Rafa's brother it must be said.

976~~~
Coleman scored seven goals last season, he was a beast going forward.

977~~~
Impressive. I didn't know that, he always seemed the fullback version of Valencia to me, strong and fast but predictable.

978~~~
He played those games in extra to whatever coleman faced with the same excellence, so it sure well does.

979~~~
Yeah he was one of the main reasons they finished ahead of us I think. 6 goals, 2 assists and 15 clean sheets in the league would be a fantastic season for one of our full backs so to achieve it in an Everton team is even more impressive.

980~~~
On last season form Coleman is better but I think Rafael will go on to be a better player and has shown he can already be better.

981~~~
Everton play with Fullbacks moving lot more forward though on both sides and others tucking in more.

You would find Baines assisting Coleman inside the box at times too.

Coleman is pretty good but so is Rafael. Injuries is big concern for Rafael but i don't see justification spunking 30 odd million on Coleman either.

982~~~
Everton have Naismith and Lukaku, we have Van Persie, Falcao, Rooney and Di Maria.

983~~~
Feck me, Coleman is almost 26?

984~~~
Agreed, I think Coleman would really suit a wing back role if we decide to stick with that. Apparently Mourinho wants him next Summer and he'll move Ivanovic central as Terry gets phased out. Coleman is a United fan so you never know.

985~~~
As is Coleman. Outrageously so.

986~~~
These comparisons were made to justify Baines, who was the major flavour of the month for a while on here too. That was, of course, until everyone realised how shit he actually is. Coleman is obviously better, but the amount of stuff that is ignored in Coleman's game (mostly defensive responsibilities) but highly scrutinised in Rafael's account is baffling. I understand there's an influx of Irish posters on here, but I seriously don't think the Everton fans think this highly of Coleman.

987~~~
The wanking over Baines reached massive proportions. He turned down United to be with Everton la, he's the proper English player with commitment la. David Moyes tried to sign him too, feck me. 

I'm beginning to question my own sanity if I'm really being thick with this Coleman > Rafael thing, hopefully it's just the Irish posters. I'm calling on my Slumdog millionaires from India to counter this frankly, frightening beast.

988~~~
We all tend to rate our own players a bit higher as we relate to them and watch them develop here.

One of my mates is a good example, back in 2005/2006 his favourite player was Heinze and he would swear blind he was the best left back in the World, had several shirts with his name on them. The minute Heinze said he wanted a move to Liverpool my mate completely disowned him and started saying Patrice was now the best around and he actually convinced himself of it too.

I like to think I can take off the red tinted specs when judging one of our players and I believe Coleman to be an upgrade on Rafael currently. That's not to say Rafa won't be at his level when he's 26 if he can control himself and increase his game intelligence.

989~~~
It's one thing to say he currently isn't better, but to say he 'may get on his level' is bollocks. He was better two seasons ago, and has started this season better.

990~~~
I'd love to see Rafa get back to his best, questions remain if anyone else can get what Fergie was able to get from him though.

991~~~
I don't believe it either but I didn't believe it with Welbeck anyway it was quite a different story. The only thing why we could assume van Gaal didn't like Rafael was when he wanted to paly 3-5-2 with wingbacks and Rafael could in his eyes be too "defensive". So he would have like to use more attacking minded players but as it turned out Rafaels looks much more threatening forward than both together which quite surprised me tbh because I thought Tony V could kick on but it didn't happen and yeah he is very very solid defensively and very consistent player. People giving him stick for BS sometimes. Like with Vardy "Typical Rafael..." That's just bs. Yes he is aggressive and little impatient sometimes but that's what we like and like football's played these days. He matured a lot. I think he can became legend here not matter what manager here is everyone must love this guy. He just needs to overcome his injuries. That is it.. I wouldn't swap him for Coleman. 

In addition to that I think we should think of some sensible back up option for him for the seasons coming. For me Young and Valencia, both of them can leave the club and they are simply not good enough maybe as a backup this season but that we already know but this guy Varela is very similar to Rafael I really hope we don't sell him to Madrid or elsewhere, I even think he s technically better and if Rafael is out this guy can be there like nothing happen in my pinion no change of style. No Janko please. Anyway either of these guy would take a role when they play only when rafael is injured which can be quite often..we can save some salaries as well..

992~~~
I wouldn't even dream of saying this 3 years ago, but I'd happily have Coleman here over Rafael. His improvement and consistency over the last couple of years are just extraordinary.

993~~~
Rafael's defending is not good enough yet. Let's see how he does over the whole season because right now the jury is still out.

994~~~
Is it not a bit weird to suggest that Coleman is only being bigged up by Irish posters when he was actually voted onto the PL team of the year last season? Was that an Irish only poll or something?

Most neutral fans would certainly rate Coleman over Rafael. Surprised people think otherwise actually.

995~~~
The Mitten article was good. I hope (if the rumours are true) that Rafael shows LvG that he deserves to be here. I've been impressed with him this year already, I don't hold him at fault for the Leicester match. As for the Coleman thing, I rate Coleman highly. I'd rather keep Rafael though, but <i>if </i>Rafael does leave then Coleman would be the man I would want to replace him.

996~~~
Coleman plays for Everton. A lot of his defensive inadequacies are brushed over and ignored. With Rafael every little mistake is scrutinized and he's called out for it. 

Rafael ahead of Coleman every single day of the week.

997~~~
lets see how Coleman performs in a team that is much less protected because it has to play offensive football like united..

998~~~
Agreed. Add this to the fact that anyone who rarely watches United (many pundits included) still think Rafael is the same player he was 5 years ago. Therefore any quasi-mistake such as against Leicester will have the same "typical rash Rafael" tag thrown at it irrespective of the irregularity of such a mistake or whether it was actually a mistake at all. These are the same pundits that were saying last season that Valencia has been one of our most consistent performers, despite him being utterly useless for 2 seasons.

To top it off Coleman has the British tag which instantly means that his good qualities are highlighted, whilst his mistakes are less scrutinised, which is providing problematic for the media as Everton have 4 British defenders and currently the worst defensive record in the League!

999~~~
I would disagree, Rafael's defence is quite good. Sunday showed it in spades.

1000~~~
Agreed. I think he gets unfairly treated over his defending. Because he is an attacking fullback, many just assume he can't defend. Sure he makes mistakes here and there but every defender does, especially fullbacks who come up against quick wingers.

1001~~~
He's the best right back in the league.

1002~~~
There are still flaws in Rafael's defensive game that I'd like to see him iron out. Mainly, his positioning is a bit suspect and he tends to get caught out. On the flip side he's a very good 1v1 defender more often than not.

But in general, most full backs these days are better going forward (Shaw seems to be an exception) so his odd defensive feck up doesn't bother me. As long as he can stay fit I wouldn't swap him for any other RB in the league.

1003~~~
Despite Coleman not being British, obviously.

1004~~~
He isn't even close to Zabaleta.

1005~~~
Well put. Also if you watch the video someone posted a few pages back of the WHU game, you can both sides of his game. First half destroyed them down our right side. Second half, even before Rooneys red card, we had started sluggish, he showed his defensive side. The second half he defended really well and also stepped up to control the defence a bit more. Offering words of advice to Rojo and McNair. Rafael is an easy target for United and non-united fans as someone else pointed out, going back the munich incident. the whole reckless tag seems to have stuck. Which is a joke when you think how long ago it was now. Yeah, he still has to work on his defensive responsibilities but with the exception of last season, he has improved with every season.

1006~~~
Exactly. Everton concede just as many goals as us, or there or there abouts, and that's with a fitter, more settled back four, one that plays together with regularity. I rate Coleman highly, but he will make errors in that back line, but seldom will they receive much coverage.

Even Zabaleta who is mentioned just above, another very good player, he's actually made a fair few errors over the past 12 months, also in high profile matches. His disciplinary record, albeit I could well be wrong here, is probably worse than Rafael's, too, given this is an apparent issue he has.

1007~~~
The media love-in extends to our Irish adopted Brits also.

1008~~~
It's fair enough not to rate Coleman or to prefer Rafael (I think he has more potential than Coleman too) but some of the points made against Coleman on the last page make absolutely no sense.

A) "Coleman is overrated because he is British" - Despite him not actually being British.
B) "It's just the Irish posters who rate Coleman this much" - Despite Coleman being named in the PFA team of the year last season by his (non-Irish) peers.
C) "I seriously don't think the Everton fans think this highly of Coleman." - Despite them naming him their player of the season last year.
D) "Rafael is better/on par with Coleman offensively" - Despite Coleman scoring more goals last season than Rafael has managed in his entire career thus far. Still, you could argue that Everton set up in a way that gets more out of their fullbacks offensively but that then contradicts...
E) "Coleman is more protected because Everton don't play offensive football like United" - You can't have it both ways. Everton either play as offensively as us (which means Coleman isn't any more protected than Rafael) or they play more defensively (which makes Coleman's effectiveness going forward even more impressive).

Even ignoring the comparison to Coleman though, I still think Rafael is overrated on the caf sometimes. He's played three games this season (including one in which he was criticized by his manager for giving away a penalty) and suddenly "he's the best right back in the league". I also note that it's now accepted as fact that Rafael was the best RB in the league the season before last despite Zabaleta actually being at least as good that year.

As I say, I like Rafael and don't see the point in signing another first choice RB (unless his fitness problems continue) but he still has an awful lot to prove before he can be regarded as the best RB in the league. Being able to stay fit would be a good start.

1009~~~
This is counter balanced on the caf by the number of people who think only Irish people rate Irish players.

1010~~~
He was getting close to that level a couple of seasons ago, but Zabaleta is so consistent.

1011~~~
Quite possibly true on the Cafe, but in the general media player's like Rafael have to do much more to be seen as a solid defender vs a player like Coleman. Likewise they also don't get the sympathy for injuries stalling their progress or breaking a run of good form.

I'd say a prime example is Rafael vs Gibbs. The general media story line is that Gibbs is a very solid defender who is just unfortunate that injuries have prevented him from being the next Ashley Cole (Talksport for instance being a prime culprit for this). Whereas Rafael hasn't matured in 6 years and is still the same rash 18 year old that can't be trusted. In reality Rafael has done more to prove he has made the step up from talented youngster to quality professional and is still a year younger. Both obviously have been hampered similarly by injuries (playing 161 vs 151 games in 7 seasons), but the media thinking is that one has been hampered by injuries, the other by a poor/rash mentality and/or immaturity.

An example in the Daily Fail: <i>Yes, Mark Clattenburg should have blown the whistle when Vardy shoved Rafael to the ground. But how foolish of Rafael to retaliate inside the 18-yard box.</i>

If that were Coleman or Gibbs I'd assert that the scrutiny would be on Vardy fouling and then diving or the referee for making 2 dreadful errors, as the media love a good reffing balls up or diving scandal. Focusing on a "retaliation" by the defender is bizarre given what actually happened.

1012~~~

1013~~~
A) British, Irish, who cares?
B) Rafael was injured all of last season and nobody said Coleman is a bad player
C) Good for Coeman
D and E) Coleman had a great year last year, but Rafael had one better the previous year

The point we're trying to make is, you are trying to tell us that Rafael is overrated on the caf although he was the best RB on the league year before last and he had injury troubles last year, while Coleman had a great year last season. They have one good season each, but Rafael has played for almost 5 years for us at Man Utd, winning a lot of trophies. That sort of consistency can't be compared to Coleman's one season, yet however, according to some of you here, Coleman somehow is a better player and Rafael has much to prove and overrated. 

The reason why everybody says Irish posters rate Coleman is because this Coleman overrating started mainly from a few vocal posters from Ireland

1014~~~
Nah, but seriously Coleman is every bit as good as Rafael, and not injury prone. Therefore he's the better player, it's an absolutely fair assessment, and you all know it.

1015~~~
No, not really. I like you Cunto, but unfortunately I don't agree with you. Breaks my heart

1016~~~
In <i>your</i> opinion Rafael's season was better than Coleman's. I'm fairly sure most neutrals would disagree. That's what irks me about the "Irish posters overrate Coleman" argument. That would only make sense if Coleman wasn't generally rated more than Rafael by non-Irish people too, but he is. The caf is literally the only place I've seen anyone make this point as most neutrals happily accept that Coleman is better. That doesn't mean they're necessarily right but it does mean it's not just an Irish thing. It's a weird argument to make.

1017~~~
I love Rafa but he is not the best right back in the league.

It is arguable that in '12/13 he <i>was</i> the best rb in the league along with Zabaleta.

Zabaleta and Coleman are better at this present moment however. Certainly has the potential to be the best right back in the league once again if he consistently performs and stays clear of injury.

1018~~~
Any chance he'll be given the armband on Sunday? He's been here for six years and counting.

1019~~~
Exactly right imo. Rafael has the potential to be better than either Zabaleta or Coleman and if he can stay fit he'll probably prove that. He just isn't better than them <i>now</i>.

1020~~~
Neutral fans also think De Gea is worse than Mignolet, that anyone's better than Rooney, Ander Herrera's shit and don't consider us one of the biggest clubs in the world.

1021~~~
Fletcher if he plays. Otherwise it'll probably go to van Persie. Should be Rafael, though.

1022~~~
I'd like to see Rafael get it and see if he takes up a better role at organising the defence if there's anyone left to play in it.

1023~~~
Anderson has been here longer but I don't think anyone will call for him to get the armband. 

Some people just aren't leadership material. Van Gaal will pick someone he trusts, prob RVP.

1024~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1025~~~
There are plenty of neutrals who rate Rafael higher than Coleman, so it only means that you have to hang out with better neutrals.

1026~~~
Except that's not true at all. The reason a lot neutrals (as well as many United fans such as myself) don't think Rafael is as good as Coleman or Zabaleta is because he's still an idiot on too many occasions. The talent is all there, he's dynamic, he's aggressive, he's very good technically and he seemed to be putting it together at last in 2012/13 before regressing again last season. If he has a good year this and can carry it forward to next year, the attitudes of others will change but, most importantly, we'll have the really high quality right back that Rafael has promised to become for years now.

1027~~~
Oh yes, yes it is.

And as for your second part, it's like you're talking about an U21 player here, in 2012/2013 he was the best right back in the league bar Zabaleta, it's nothing to do with promise, he's delivered, one season where he was mostly injured and clearly not match fit can't replace how excellent he was that year, he reached heights Coleman didn't (that's subjective but I'll stand by it).

1028~~~
Who are these neutrals who rate Mignolet above De Gea? Even the Liverpool fans on here don't think that and the rest of your claims are nonsense as well. One season of good form (where he still had some shit games) does not count as making it, he needs to back it up. I said if he does this season going forwards then he'll establish himself as one of the top full backs around but he has to do that. So far he's played 3 games, 2 he did well in and Leicester where he had a couple of really poor moments.

1029~~~
I'm sorry but who gives a flying feck about the neutrals? They don't watch every United game (or every Everton game for that matter) and are in no position to have an informed opinion about either of them. Seemingly, most of the opinion on Rafael has been formed on the basis of a couple of brain farts and they all pretend the season 2012-2013 never happened. Unfortunately for Rafael he plays for United. Good performances are expected and poor one's are highlighted. With Coleman good performances are praised and the poor ones ignored. Look at Leighton Baines for instance. Are his defensive mistakes pointed by the media? feck no. He made more mistakes against Liverpool than Rafael has made in the entire season.

Everton fans would rather keep Coleman I'm sure and United fans (most I hope) would rather have Rafael. Win Win.

1030~~~
One season of good form? Wash your mouth out? He replaced Gary Neville and it's a testament to his quality that replacing such a prolific player like Gary has not been felt by United. 

It doesn't seem so unfortunately. We'd be pining for Shamus fecking Coleman. The mind fecking boggles.

1031~~~
Problem is that some people still regard him as 'idiot', for instance Rory here, and bring up that fe.king Bayern game even when he doesnt do anyhting wrong. Against Leicester he was fouled and didnt foul Vardy but people still banged about him being too harsh or whatever. As akash said his mistakes are always highlighted even by United fans although I dont think he makes so many mistakes as it would seem when reading or hearing what saome people have to say..

1032~~~
Coleman? Seriously?

1033~~~
Just don't. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1034~~~
Best in general or best on current form? For me he's not the best either way and saying so is United bias. Rafael is not the best right back in the league. He didn't have a good enough season under Moyes to be considered so and he's only played a few games this season, he's coming into good form but he hasn't done anything to be considered the best. He definitely has the tools to be the best, but lets see how long he can stay injury free and how long he can keep his current form. The following five have strong claims to be considered better than Rafael based on last season and recent form ;Zabaleta, Coleman, Ivanovic, Sagna, Debuchy (yes Debuchy is injured now, but he had a great season with Newcastle)

1035~~~
Because people are stuck with clichés and aren't bothered with further analysis. Stuck in their ways, it's just easier. Especially that way with pundits who have to analyse 10 games but you know they didn't watch them all. They therefor rely on cliches. If you think about it you will notice it every episode.

1036~~~
Debuchy had a good season, and not a great season. Unless you saw all of Newcastle match last season, you can't obviously be sure about Debuchy's season as you are doing with Rafael. Maybe you are a newcastle fan, but I'm guessing you've watched the season highlights of Debuchy. Rafael was injured last season, so you can't take that as a point of reference and nobody here is saying Rafael had a better season than any of those people. All we are trying to say is that 'He definitely has the tools to the best' lalala is nonsense, because he's already proved that he's one of the best RB's in the league when he's not injured. 

Sure, there are questions about his injury record, but this constant 'He has potential, maybe he'll show, or maybe he won't', and then using Shamus Coleman and Debuchy as better performers citing consistency is taking the mick. If Rafael sympathizers use a similar argument against coleman to ask for patience on how he performs on European stage, you get jumped on with stats of last season and how he performed well in the International matches.

1037~~~
Exactly!! Not everyone has to wear rose tinted spectacles, but it seems we are all waiting for a mistake from one of our players to throw them under the bus. Be it a Rooney red mist or a Rafael out of position. All of our players played poorly last season, so trade them all to Accrington Stanley?

1038~~~
Ivanovic is by a considerable distance the most consistent right back in the league, closely followed by his compatriot Cesar, who if also played at right back, would prove more consistent than many of those mentioned above.

Debuchy doesn't belong here. I've seen a lot of him at Newcastle and he's a lucky man to be playing at Arsenal. Zabaleta's discipline is worse than Rafael's, albeit that is seldom scrutinised. I don't think his form is as good as it once was either. I've covered Coleman before. He's a good player, sometimes very good, but a defender at plucky Everton will see that his strengths are identified more so than his weaknesses. Opinions of Luke Shaw will change this season. Last season, at Southampton, a bad word was never said. At United there is a change. Good performances are expected, praised less, and errors, and they always exist irrespective of the club one plays their football, are given more airtime. Shaw will receive more negativity this season than ever before. He's already put on weight.

I rate Rafael highly, he's probably my favourite player. But he needs another fit, consistent season to come into the discussion. It is a little bit tiring, however, that we're discussing Seamus Coleman yet again, for practically no reason at all. It's boring.

1039~~~
Yes he is. Rock solid, consistent, reliable. Doesn't dive in (eh up Rafa) good in the air, gets you 4 or 5 goals a season. Top quality.

1040~~~
Team of the week here: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2014/oct/01/europe-teams-week-premier-league-arsenal-liverpool" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...e-teams-week-premier-league-arsenal-liverpool</a>

1041~~~
Everything you have written, I 100% agree with. More than anything, the BIB. Zabaleta discipline in terms of cards, is a lot worse than Rafaels and like you said, it does not get picked up on at all. For instance, when they played against Chelsea couple of weeks back. Yeah, Lampards equaliser took a lot off the attention of Pablos red, but he hardly got any flack for it at all. Same with his red card in the cup final v wigan. He is a good player, but if he was scrutinised as closely as Rafael is, he would not be as highly rated as he is.

1042~~~
Zabaleta hasn't been anywhere near his best this season and he is picking up a lot of cards but don't forget he had a good World Cup and went all the way to the final, Rafael will be lucky to even get another call up to a Brazil squad. It's not really fair to compare the two at the moment I don't think.

1043~~~
I completely agree. People are too lazy to think for themselves.

1044~~~
we all know that isn't because of form though so I'm not even sure why you'd use it as a point of comparison.

1045~~~
It's astounding that people will look for excuses for every other right back's form. It's stupid and pointless.

1046~~~
A fair post.

1047~~~
It is definitely true on Rafael's case though. Usually not being called (or not starting) for a national team is a poor argument. Scholes was being shifted all over the place in order to make comfortable two inferior players to play in that favorite position. Riquelme wasn't called for Argentina despite being their best player on around 5 years prior to it. There are countless examples on national teams, how managers have their favorites and play them instead of superior players (like Scolari with vice captain Luiz who played while better players like Miranda or Marquinhos weren't called at all).

1048~~~
His argument makes no sense whatsover. 

"Zabaleta has been inconsistent and got a red card already"

"but hey ho, he played in the World cup lolzy".

1049~~~
It's a good thing Rafa wasn't in the squad for Brazil in the summer. The "neutrals" would have found a way to blame him for that as well.

1050~~~
I'm always having sleep over parties with neutrals, and they tell me that boy Rafael needs to prove himself.

1051~~~
When talking about Pablos discipline, I didn't mean just this season. I ment his City career. There was a stat I read on the BBC site after he got sent off v Chelsea, that was his 6th red in 7 seasons there. Rafael not getting called up for the national team is not about the football. He was solely blamed for them losing the gold medal match v the Mexicans at 2012 Olympics. As I said in another thread, other than the error in the final, he was there 2nd best player in the tournament. Had a great tournament other than that one error. So no, unless Brazil wake up to the fact Maicon is past it, Rafael wont even get a chance to get called up as a squad player. As a united fan, I think great as means he will have less games etc. But Rafael would love to play for Brazil again one day. But like fishfingers said, good job he was nowhere there poor squad and even worse defence in the summer.

1052~~~
Well, obviously the reason we refer to neutrals is to eliminate any bias towards our own players. Makes sense really, especially when we're discussing a general point like who the best RB in the league is.

Would I bother replacing Rafael with Coleman? No, it would be pretty pointless given that I rate Rafael and Coleman would cost a fortune. If I had a theoretical choice between either of them atm though it would be Coleman as he's simply a better player right now. That doesn't mean Rafael can't overtake him though. In fact he probably should given that he has more potential imo.

1053~~~
Coleman is 2 years older than Rafael and, as someone pointed out earlier, never played in the CL. He is a good player but until he plays against the big boys and as Kag pointed out, for a team where he is scrutinised so closely, you can't put him in the box as the others mentioned in the thread: Zabaleta and Invanovic.

1054~~~
Anyway, forget comparisons with other players.

The real point is that Rafael has played three games this season, one of which saw him criticised by our manager for giving away a penalty. This isn't enough form for us to start calling him the best RB in the league, particularly given he was quite poor last season (along with the rest of our team).

He really, really needs to stay fit this season. One more injury plagued year and we'll <i>have</i> to replace him as our first choice, regardless of how much we rate him. Having a proper RB in our team makes such a difference...

1055~~~
Coleman might score a few more goals but I don't think he's better all round than Rafael at all.

1056~~~
I don't care whether or not Rafael is the best RB in the league. I wouldn't swap him for anyone regardless.

And I don't even think Coleman is better than Rafael going forward. Sure he scores more goals but that does not mean he's better. He has more goals from RB than Alves as well for what it's worth.

1057~~~
BIB, tbh I think when your only other senior option is Valencia, you would pretty much take anyone over Valencia or young there and hopefully neither of Jones and Smalling plays there ever again. Even if it is a kid that gets a chance, as long as it is a proper RB, like you said.

1058~~~
I read that as, 'Balotelli, tbh I think...'

1059~~~
What else would you base 'better going forward' on if not goals and assists?

1060~~~
Coleman has more goals than Alves. Is he better than him as well? We're talking about right backs, not strikers. Until he became a goal scoring freak in his last two seasons how many goals and assists did Evra rack up prior to that? Not very productive I'd imagine and yet no one would say he wasn't brilliant going forward even back then.

1061~~~
All I can say is stats speak for themselves. If Coleman has scored more goals than Alves then yes, it wouldn't be crazy to say he's better going forward, but perhaps the better thing to say would be that he's a bigger goal threat. Coleman also contributes in other ways offensively than just scoring though, so his goalscoring gives him a strong argument and an advantage. If he played for one of the big teams he'd get more world wide recognition for his attacking prowess and you probably wouldn't even touch this debate.

1062~~~
Coleman is as overrated as Baines was. Good (nothing more) for Everton, found out at a higher level. 

Anyway back to Rafael, maybe Dunga will recall him sometime, who knows ...

1063~~~
Stats don't speak for themselves, though. Not at all. They require interpretation and are more often that not overly relied upon.

A RB can easily be fantastic going forwards but not have much in the way of goal/assist stats.

1064~~~
Same argument could be had about his defensive abilities as well though. If he moved to a bigger team, people will look more closely at him defensively and scrutinise him a lot more than what he gets at everton.

1065~~~
It would be totally crazy to say Coleman is better than Alves (going forward or sitting down). You lot are overdoing it.

1066~~~
I'd imagine he is better than Alves at this stage yeah.
I must have missed this part, when was Coleman found out at a higher level or can you see the future?

1067~~~
Sadly, we've been posting more about Coleman than Rafael.

1068~~~
Once again, if some RB called Colemanito was doing what Coleman was doing but at Real Madrid, people would be calling him one of the best attacking RBs. If Jordi Alba played for Swansea would he get even half the praise he gets as a Barca player? When real Madrid signed Cicinho some years back (we were linked with him too) he was immediately considered one of the best attacking RBs but he flopped miserably. Alves has the immediate 'advantage' of playing for a world famous elite team. Im not saying Coleman is better going forward, but its not crazy to say so either. Goals are goals.

Some United fans think Rafael is the best RB in the league for instance and IMO that's not the case. If he played for a lower team he'd be seen as a good player with great potential but too injury prone to hack it at the top.

1069~~~
This exactly!

1070~~~
If it's crazy to suggest the Irish posters are overrating Coleman, it's equally crazy to say that Coleman is not getting plaudits because he's playing for Everton and he's Irish. Jordi Alba doesn't play for Swansea and he doesn't face attackers from the Premier League, he faces the best players in the world while playing for Barcelona. Alves was a part of the greatest football club sides ever and not only was he just a part of the side, but he was an important player for them, in both attack and defense. Coleman has played for Everton in the Premier League and had a great year, like Rafael had a great year last season. If we are going to compare Coleman to Alves and Jordi Alba, why are you not doing with Rafael then? 

It is completely bonkers to say Coleman is better going forward than Alves, it really is. At his best, Alves will not be even in the same zip code as Coleman.

1071~~~
Except he's not doing it at Real Madrid.

He's no where near the level of Alves or even Evra ta his peak for us. It's scandalous to even suggest that.

1072~~~
To me, Coleman is two years older than Rafael. In two years time, I expect Rafael to be far far better than Coleman is currently at the age of soon to be 26. Rafael does have lots of potential still but we know he has fitness trouble. However, he should still be well on course to be better than Coleman is at that age. Saying that, I honestly don't believe Coleman is at Rafaels level now anyway. Good player, yes. But as others have pointed out, hasn't been tested regularly by top players and in the top competitions. It is a shame that Rafas best season for us, was followed up by Moyes taking over. He really could of pushed on from his best. At the same time, at least he looks happy playing again this season and started looking like the player he was in 12/13 compared to last season. Attacking, fast paced football suits Rafaels game to the ground and LVG has brought that back to united.

1073~~~
Baines was while playing with England and most ppl here (irrespective of the team they supported) wanted Cole for the WC despite him hardly playing last season. 
Regarding Coleman noone knows yet. There have been many examples where a good player for a midtable team couldn't make the step up (including current United players) and until Coleman proves he can make the step up (he might get some chance in the EL this season) we can't just assume he can.

1074~~~
Its not scandalous at all. You sound like an elitist, only players who have played for one of the big teams are worthy of high praise it seems. I don't even rate Coleman that highly, im just saying he's shown that he can be just as good an attacking fullback as any

1075~~~
Even if Rafael is a bit lesser than Coleman or any of the other names being compared to - what he brings in terms of drive and desire is something we have so little through the squad that alone, to me, makes me hands down the better player for United than any of the others.

1076~~~
What worries me is Rafael is always seen as young and learning, and people let him off with rash mistakes because of this.

He's what, 24 and been playing week in week out when fit for years now. I really hope in the summer we get another right back to give him competition, and for when he's injured. 

I love him but I think we over rate him on the caf. Zabaleta, Ivanovic, Coleman and arguably Clyne are better than him at the moment.

1077~~~
Christ.

1078~~~
Clyne has been great for Southampton.

1079~~~
And Rafael has been great for us. Clyne has been good going forward, but defensively he's very average and completely unaware of his surrondings.

1080~~~
He's younger than you'd think too, has an old look about him.

Liverpool should have replaced Johnson with him but I don't think Southampton fans would accept them selling any more players to Liverpool.

1081~~~
That same statement about Clyne could describe Rafael a lot of the time. Rafael was poor last season, and has barely played this.

1082~~~
And Rafael was far better than season before last than Clyne has ever been. He's already been MOTM in one of last three matches he's played, and was key in the QPR game. It's like people want to add more players to downplay how good he actually is.

1083~~~
That may sound elitist, but the problem is suggesting Coleman is a better player than Alves sounds idiotic. Either you are actually overrating Coleman, or you've never seen Alves during his best years at Sevilla and Barcelona. 

You've left the other 15 in the league though.

1084~~~
Ah now. I like Coleman but there's no way he's better going forward than Dani Alves.

Goals are great but they're not <i>everything</i>. 

There's no way Clyne should be in this debate either.

1085~~~
High five mate, we agree on something finally.

1086~~~
<b>Idiotic</b> you say? Where did I say that Coleman is a better fvcking player than Alves? I thought we were talking about and comparing their attacking play? All I did was bring up their strike rate, one aspect of offensive play and I correctly stated that Coleman's scoring record is more impressive. Alves only scored twice last season and zero before that. His goalcoring has steadily decreased every season since he joined Barca, with his best return coming in his first season there in 2008/09. Coleman has scored just 2 goals shy of the number of goals Alves has scored for Barcelona and he did it in half the number of games. Even when you factor in his Sevilla strike rate, Coleman still has a better goals to games ratio for his Everton career compared to Alves Sevilla and Barcelona careers.  Alves kills Coleman when it comes to assists, so it evens it up for me. Look at the fvcking stats, you're taking a lot away from Coleman because of who he plays for.

1087~~~
It's idiotic to suggest that Coleman is better at going forward than Dani Alves. It's actually beyond idiotic, it's outrageous.

1088~~~
He has a better strike rate than Alves. Thats a motherfvcking fact

1089~~~
Seeing as this thread as got a little sidetracked, back to Rafael smile to calm it down again<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>:

1090~~~
He's coming into really good form, long may it continue.

1091~~~
God, all this backlash and he has been getting 7 to 8/10 performances this season. Imagine when he has a bad game

1092~~~
A lot of fans appreciate Rafael and I'm sure he's a fans favourite for the match going fans as well. The vocal minority here can suck it and keep watching Clyne.

1093~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It's honestly bizarre. The lad has started the season brilliantly coming back from fitness and absolutely loves the club, yet many just want to berate every error -however minute- he makes.

1094~~~
I saw the Leicester game, I'd rather not think about that anymore.

1095~~~
Zabaleta was just as shite as Rafael last year and he wasn't being managed by David Moyes.

1096~~~
Rafael is one our few players in our first XI , who plays for the shirt with pride, On top of that hes also a good player

So I dont understand, and never have the amount of unwarranted hate he gets

1097~~~
My only complain with Rafael is his injuries. If he could get a good run of games under his belt we'd really see the best of him again.

1098~~~
He has been one of our best players so far. Fair enough, he had a bad game against Leicester but which United player didn't? Personally I don't blame him for the penalty either as it was a dive from Vardy. Rafael could have been more intelligent and disciplined by avoiding contact on the blind-side of Vardy but if I was Rafael I would be questioning Clattenberg's sense of perception. If a physical 'shoulder-barge' from Vardy seconds earlier wasn't a foul, how can a slight brush on Vardy be considered a penalty?

1099~~~
He still was our top 3 performer, the reason why people calling him shit is that he got sent off in one match and maybe had one more worse match later but he was very consistent anyway that season which was disrupted with injuries. And still he was able to perform straight away coming back from injuries which is quality of a top matured player. Yes sometimes he's a little crazy and tends to overreact but that's what we love, don't we? It wasn't his best season under Moyes but noway it was a shit season

1100~~~
Nah, Rafael definitely had a shit season last year. I wouldn't really blame him for that though as almost everyone had a shit season and he had his injury problems on top of that. Tbh there was no real way he was going to be brilliant in those circumstances.

Surprised to see a few people saying Rafael gets unnecessary hate here though. I'd have thought he was very popular on the caf. He's certainly one of my favourite players even if I don't quite rate him as highly as others do atm.

1101~~~
Appears to have a good partnership and understanding with Herrera forming, haven't seen much comments on it.

1102~~~
Probably not as notable as it's not your typical right side partnership of a fullback and winger.

1103~~~
Yeah, Herrera definatly favours that little pass out wide to Rafael. Its almost like his 'get out move', when he's under pressure he'll look for Rafa.

1104~~~
I've noticed this as well. I think, with Rafael on the right, Herrera may feel more comfortable to drift out to the right knowing that Rafael's around to support him. Herrera and Rafael can prove to be a very fruitful partnership, I feel. Herrera himself can do well out wide, but since he's rarely played there, he doesn't drift out often enough. With Rafael around, our right side will become much stronger.

1105~~~
But any player in that position would be there to receive the pass, I don't believe it has anything to do with Rafa.

1106~~~
Yeah, I was going to say this. Centre midfielders tend to pass to the full backs a lot. If they're under pressure - the full back is usually in lots of space.
Not sure it's a partnership or even an understanding. Herrera might drift towards there, but that's just how he plays.

1107~~~
this.

1108~~~
To be fair, you'd rather have Rafael as your 'get out move' than Smalling.

1109~~~
He and di Maria have been a level ahead in the past couple games, in my opinion. Ander too, but he's out at the minute.

1110~~~
If he stays if the will be one of our most important players this season. He adds so much to our attack. Long may his reign continue.

1111~~~
Has been excellent today.

1112~~~
That cross that ended up being Di Maria's goal, amazing! Defended really well and something others don't pick up on, his heading ability. Always seems to be in the right place and has made some great headed clearances today. Hasn't stopped running all match either, constantly powering down the right.

1113~~~
Has been utterly brilliant.

1114~~~
Really needs to get a fit season under his belt. I think if he gets that one fully fit season he'll be able to put together a consistently fit run, just like RVP has managed. And he's fkin brilliant when fit.

1115~~~
Showing good leadership in that first half, defended well and always a threat on the right.

1116~~~
He's a joy to watch when on song.

1117~~~
It's great to see him finding some of his best form again that he first showed a couple of years back. Really promising.

1118~~~
His crossing has improved a lot. Gets excellent shape/curve on them.

1119~~~
He was bloody phenomenal in that half. Must have covered 10k as well, he was up and down like a brides nighty on that right hand side.

1120~~~
Rather have Clyne. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1121~~~
Great stuff so far, back on 12/13 form.

1122~~~
Its so good to have him back...Missed him so much in the first three games... Perfect Wingback...

1123~~~
I actually thought he would struggle to be effective offensively due to using a diamond and no overlap fro the likes of Valencia, which he thrived off in the past. He has proven me wrong in the past couple of games, and he has stepped up defensively too. Let's hope he cracks on this season and stays fit throughout, because we are that much more dangerous when he is going forward.

1124~~~
Even with his inconsistent crossing he has everything you can ask from your fullback attacking wise. He is great, it's ridiculous how much he means for our attacking play.

1125~~~
God, when this guy is fully fit and on form, he's a joy to have. Yet again, he's been brilliant, defensively and going forward.

1126~~~
Just as Rooney playing well was a harbinger for his suspension, I can't shake the feeling that Rafael's form is just a teaser before his next knock. Hope I'm wrong, we're clearly better with him at right back.

1127~~~
Di Maria and De Gea will rightly get the plaudits today but this wee fella had a fantastic game today. If he can just get through this season without any injuries he will be amazing for us.

1128~~~
He's in incredible form atm

1129~~~
Was good again. Great to see that he has got some form going. Just needs to stay fit now.

1130~~~
Could be entering beast mode again. Was superb today, didn't put a foot wrong. Hopefully keeps this run of form going, 2 great games in a row.

1131~~~
Thought he had an excellent game. Nicks in ahead of people really well. As ever he just needs to stay fit.

1132~~~
If he stays injury free we're in for a treat, absolutely love the guy <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1133~~~
another great performance from him. Really looks like he is getting back to his best.

1134~~~
So great to have him back to his best.

1135~~~
Every time he goes in for a challenge I cringe a bit in fear of his knees blowing out or something. He's so important for us right now.

1136~~~
Was brilliant today honestly my motm

1137~~~
Was my man of the match until De Gea turned into catwoman.  Great game from Rafael, and so good to have him back. Hopefully no new niggles are on the horizon.

1138~~~
Best rightback in the league when in form. Lovely little player.

1139~~~
I've said it many times. He is the best right back in the league. When fully fit and on form, no one is on his level, his issue is that it seems a rarity for him to stay fit for a long period of time.

1140~~~
Correct me if I'm wrong but I think every single thing he did today he did perfectly (bar a couple of crosses after great runs forward)...and he did a hell of a lot. My outfield man of the match.

1141~~~
Was very good today. I think this formation suits him too, gets plenty of opportunity to show what he can do going forward.

Also shows what a massive difference having a proper RB makes rather than having to make do with a CB playing out of position.

1142~~~
Pretty much yeah, did the right thing every time we were attacked down our right side, which was very often.
Brilliant performance, yet not a word from the 'rash challenge on Vardy' folk.

1143~~~
Another superb performance from Rafael.

1144~~~
Quality game from Rafael again. Solid in defence and put in some great defensive headers. Forward wise, had a couple of poor crosses but that ball which lead to the first goal was superb. Again, always an outlet down our right and was constantly bombing forward. When Oviedo put in that late and unnecessary challenge I winced but Rafael got up and was fine. One of my motm.

1145~~~
Don't care what anyone says. Best RB in the league.  Just stay fit now.

1146~~~
I hope he stays fit, he adds so much to our game when he's on form.

1147~~~
Been amongst our best 3 players so far this season.

1148~~~
was great today.

1149~~~
Very good going forward isn't he?  But needs to improve his crossing.

I'll go 8/10 today.  But still think he's dodgy defensively and always will be.

There we are.

The Raf fanboys are out in force aren't they? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1150~~~
Non-stop today and had an excellent game. Joy to watch and he really does look like he is back to his best. Hope that he stays injury free as he is such an asset and brings so much drive and quality to the side. Playing like that he'll soon be reversing his detractors opinions of him- still not thought much of outside of United.

1151~~~
Long may this form continue. If it does he can finally silence the naysayers and show the potential that United fans know he has.

1152~~~
Looks like the anti-Rafa squad is holding on by a thread, ey? How can you give a defender an 8/10 then say he's shit defensively <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1153~~~
On what basis?

Today for example, what exactly about his defending did you consider dodgy?

1154~~~
Maybe he was watching Cardiff?

1155~~~
WUM alert.

1156~~~
Click on the link for the stats.

1157~~~
Rafael has been on fire since the penalty, show's his mentality as a man, he won't let anything get him down.

1158~~~
He's outstanding. 

Stay fit you beautiful little man and at least one piece of the defensive puzzle is in place. Let the world continue with the myth that you're a hot headed loony.

1159~~~
I'm going to say he didn't have a direct opponent today and there was a couple of crosses that went in near him.  He doesn't match up with a man when crosses go in towards the back post - when the back post is his area if you see what I mean.  Look I'm also busy praising Valencia against the 'haterz' so we need to conclude that I'm right and you're all wrong fairly soon.

I can go to 8 1/2 today possibly but that's it really, this best RB in the League/World is silly talk tho.

1160~~~
Zabaleta has been shaky this season putting it lightly, other than Ivanovic who else has been great at Right-back this season?

1161~~~
If the back post is his area why would he leave it to pick up a man? 

Also worth pointing out he cleared off the line from that area in the first half.

1162~~~
This is close to the issue I have with him, tbh.  And my answer is this.

Because that's usually the key decision/awareness that you need to have when you are the back-stick defensive player.  Do I need to help my CBs?  Am I able to help my CBs?  Where's the opposition wing player who might come in on my blindside and get a jump on me because I've not got close enough to him early enough - which is my best chance of doing a very difficult thing and marking him out of connecting with a quality cross.  Fortunately a lot of the wing players won't be big enough or that interested in competing for those headers either.

That's my reservation, that he doesn't, and can't do that.  Although there was the 1 he defended well today, as you say, and 2 that he didn't from what I remember.  It's picky because of how good he is going forward and how admirably competitive he is.  On a good day, his competitiveness doesn't become a liability either but sometimes it does.  It's the same with the defensive positioning issue.

As we said, he was 'done' on reputation alone last week by a f**kwit referee - referees are supposed to know better.

Both aspects are a does the good outweigh the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">bad</span> (let's say less good, instead)? kinda question.  You pays your money and takes your choice.  I'm still slightly against I'm afraid.

But yes, he played well enough today.

1163~~~
Made a few vital tackles/interceptions down the right today. Watching an on form Rafael is a joy.

1164~~~
Please find a way to stay healthy Rafael.

1165~~~
The kid oozes class. Plays with his heart. Another superb display.

1166~~~
Excellent performance... he makes that whole right hand side of the pitch his own.

1167~~~
I don't care, he should have got the armband.

1168~~~
his defensive side of his game is very underated he showed today he s world class defender and set up the first goal as well. Stay fit Rafa!

1169~~~
Great display today and provided plenty of penetration down the right flank. Absolutely bossed Pienaar till he went off and he has been one of our best players so far this season. If I'm really picky then I would say it would be great if he could just improve his composure at the back a wee bit. 

He seems to love clearing the ball more often than not when we are defending deep but perhaps should look to conserve possession whenever possible and take the sting out of the opposition's momentum. Just felt that Rojo and Rafael were guilty of doing these a couple of times towards the end of the match which meant that we were ceding possession unnecessarily to the opposition and just inviting pressure onto ourselves. I'm not saying we always have to recklessly play out from the back or be like Barcelona but a bit more composure at the back would be welcome. Shaw, Blackett and McNair looked bloody composed and weren't too hasty with their clearances whilst only clearing the ball when they really had to.

1170~~~
Does anyone have a GIF of the exact moment where Rafael cleanly takes a cross pass from di Maria beautifully with his chest and continues running? He's so good at that, it's amazing.

1171~~~
I don't know about that. I think he mixes it perfectly. There are times you just need to smash it and get organized and then are times where you can play it out and go on the counter. He does both very well.

1172~~~
Been great since coming back from injury. If he stays fit he's the most complete right back in the league for me, injuries have always held him back.

1173~~~
Lovely to see him back and playing so well, he's one of my favourites is Rafael.

We look so much more balanced with him at right back, if those rumours about Van Gaal not rating him in pre-season were true you'd have to say hopefully he's changed his mind since then. Rafael has been one of our best players this season.

1174~~~
Another class performance. Improved his heading tremendously.

1175~~~
Terrific again today. Excellent defensively and some great crosses. He's a player that gets really harshly treated by the media imo. He's a very good player.

1176~~~
Yep, two great performances in a row now. Long may it continue.

1177~~~
I wouldn't swap him with any right back. feck the haters.

Get lost Alvez. We have a lad that gets this club and loves playing for it.

1178~~~
I honestly think he is the most important player in our team to keep fit and ready to go. The quality of his back ups is laughable.

1179~~~
I am really really worried about what happens when he gets injured. Rafael has been absolutely brilliant since coming back and has played a major role in many of our goals. Can't even imagine the alternative of playing Valencia/Jones/Smalling there.

1180~~~
thought that was a terrific display today, who else can get up and back like that all game?
Would be interested what his critics had to say about that one.

1181~~~
I love this guy, so much passion and determination to win, i wouldn't even trade him for Lahm, thats how much i rate him, the only thing stops this guy is injuries, he has the potential to be the best RB in the world, the one we have at the LB isn't bad either, wow what a set of fullbacks. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1182~~~
Agreed, another great performance.

1183~~~
I had him down as MOTM today until De Gea decided he was superman.

1184~~~
He's been class this season.

1185~~~
Just properly realised how good that original cross is from Rafa. If the defender doesn't get a touch to it, Falcao probably heads it straight in.

1186~~~
Apparently he's dodgy in defence, and staying on his post to clear off the line is evidence of his poor decision making.

1187~~~
Reinvented himself under van Gaal.

1188~~~
Me too.

1189~~~
How so? He was good under SAF in his last season.

1190~~~
He was brilliant in 2012-12, and started off last season too quite well. I thought he was our best player till around November and coped well with Moyes. But then he got injured and then the Moyes effect well and truly kicked in.

If you go back and watch the earlier parts of last season (i don't know why you would want to do that though), you would see that he was one of the few who were coping with the change brought about by Moyes. Then he got injured, and Moyes used him sporadically and even Rafael too lost confidence and form.

I think he is absolutely brilliant, a real leader. I would go so far as to say he is a real character like Keane and Robson, and a bigger fighter than even the likes of G.Neville. I hope he gets the Evra attribute of staying fit, which is the only thing missing.

1191~~~
I was positive when him and his brother arrived that Fabio would go on to be a star for us and Rafa would maybe be a back up for us or shipped off overseas. How wrong I was he is clearly top class and one of the best in the league.

1192~~~
I feel like he can reach new heights in this team. The style of attack is suited to him, and the quality of the team helps his contribution look even better. 

JUST STAY HEALTHY

1193~~~
Word about Mcnair as well, superbly played Lukaku today. Rafael was superb today. Pienaar or Baines, he just handled them so well. Whatever happened to Coleman today? Was he injured?

1194~~~
What is this then? So, he can't do/doesn't do the key decision/awareness a fullback needs, and he played well as a fullback? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1195~~~
He's just brilliant. So much of passion and energy in his play.

1196~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> same here.

1197~~~
Wouldn't trade him for any right back in the world now

1198~~~
Coleman got injured v Wolfsberg and including yesterdays match, has missed the last 5 games because of the injury.

1199~~~
His attitude is really amazing. He's been criticized and written off so many times and his response has always been spot on. Lucky to have him here, he seems to genuinely love the club.

1200~~~
Speaking to 3 United fans at work this morning. They all seem to be muttering "We need to sort out Right Back". "Fine going forward. Shit defender".

I just don't get it. Since returning from injury, he's not really put a foot wrong. Not only that, but he's been among our best players. Man of the Match even, against West Ham.

Are we all living on a different planet to non-Caf football watchers? It feels like it sometimes. Before this, it was months and months of "De Gea's shite" over the past 2 years or so.

1201~~~
I agree with this. I'm amazed that people still don't rate Rafael at all. At worst he is a decent fullback (of course in reality we know he is better than that).

1202~~~
I expect it from non-United fans. I don't really care if they don't rate our players, and United players are nearly always shot down, no matter how good they are. I don't understand it from United fans though. He's clearly playing well, and seems to improve all the time (except under Moyes, when the whole squad was poor).

Then again, I suppose it speaks volumes of the type of United fans I'm talking to when one of them didn't even know Fabio existed <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1203~~~
It's one of those things where people seem to only remember the times when he does something rash. Yes, he is overly-aggressive sometimes because he plays with his heart on his sleeve and I wouldn't want it any other way. He can attack, can defend and probably has an iron lung the way he is constantly running up and down the pitch and it's clear as day that he LOVES playing for us. I wouldn't swap him for 90% of RBs in the world... plus we share the same name <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1204~~~
Thought he was improved yesterday.

1205~~~
Erm, so when we played Arsenal in that cup match, when both Raf and Fab were playing on opposite wings, who did they think the other one was?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I would concede this actually, a tendency to only remember the negatives - esp about defenders!!  Part of the reason to come here is to get an alternative point of view even if it remains obv the case that I am still right and everyone else wrong. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>  I also feel that our views often appear to divide on binary & literal lines as well (see Kagawa threads)

Let's see how it pans out with Super Raf.  LVGs view is probably going to outrank ours. He has to play at the moment because we don't have anybody else!! Lets hope he can stay fit. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1208~~~
fans are generally fickle, no nothing idiots, who get swayed by public perceptions.

We saw it with De Gea. Everyone said he was rubbish, and now everyone says he's amazing. The truth is not in the middle, as I think it's a lot nearer the amazing side of the divide, but you get my point.

1209~~~
Exactly that was two seasons ago. He didn't have the best of times last season.

1210~~~
Other than De Gea from the seniors, no one did.

1211~~~
These past few games looked like Rafael during his last season under Sir Alex. When fit he has always been a very consistent performer that gives his best in each and every game.

1212~~~
God knows. Probably Phil Neville.

1213~~~
Was just going through some old folders and found this image - love it!

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/wvWBTm2.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/wvWBTm2.jpg"/> 

He can be a bit rash sometimes, but wouldn't swap him for any RB (not saying he is necessarily the best RB in the world, but he fits our club very well!).

1214~~~
Have to admit I'd almost given up on Rafael. He always seemed prone to a moment of stupidity, and he wasn't doing enough good to compensate for that at the time. However, credit where it's due, he's really standing out this season. Looks a proper full back all of a sudden, some good defensive work and lots to offer going forward.

Hope he keeps it up, he's turning me into a believer!

1215~~~
Pereira said Rafael was one of five players he would bring to a five a side match. Obviously, Rafael is terrific on the ball and a brilliant short passer. His link-up play is up there with that of Evra and his pace is great also. Strong, good in the air. If he keeps this up, he should be competing for that RB spot for Brazil.

1216~~~
Where were you two seasons ago? I thought he was all of that in Fergie's last season and was the best RB in the league. We played against Bale and Rafael didn't give him an inch.

1217~~~
I love how he's just ready to take on four Liverpool players on his own. In the Sir Alex interview MUTV aired tonight, the old boss said to MUTV that the loss to Liverpool hurt him more than anything else last season. I bet he loved having Rafa in his dressing room when the big games came around.

1218~~~
I was still recovering from his red card against Bayern a couple of years before. But you're right, he has looked good in spells. It's just that it all comes crashing down when he does something rash.

1219~~~
I don't think it's in "patches" at all. The 2012/13 season was basically Rafael putting in 7(+)/10 performances for almost all of the season. He's also come back into the team and has been doing similar. Provided he stays fit, I think we will see a repeat season akin to his performances in Sir Alex's last season.

1220~~~
Wonder what you thought of Roy Keane then?

1221~~~
why the feck isnt he called up for Brazil?

1222~~~
They are still holding a grudge against him for the Olympics final and he hasn't been called since and in recent times Dunga wants taller fullbacks or something like that again. Bit weird as they call up makeshifts and past it Maicon and Alves ahead.

Good for us anyway, as less travel and less chances of him picking up another injury.

1223~~~
This.

1224~~~
He's a mile better than anything else they have. I echo the sentiment that it's good for us, especially with his injury record but I do feel for the little fella, you just know how much he'd want to represent his country.

1225~~~
I'm glad he doesn't get called up because it is better for United, I feel a bit sorry for Rafael though.

1226~~~
I feel sorry for Rafael not making it to Brazil as well. It's clear that his one moment at the final of the Olympics is still keeping him out of the side, and it seems as if unless he leaves Man. Utd., he will rarely make it into Brazil's first team.

1227~~~
Shame he has already played for Brazil, or he could be a great little right back for England. The feckers are blind if they don't rate him.

1228~~~
He is the best Brazilian right back now.

1229~~~
I don't actually think they do, it'll take them another year or two before they lose the lazy narratives when rating our lesser known players. Take De Gea, who was until only recently the "good shot stopper but physically cannot command."

1230~~~
I don't care that he isn't being called up, less chance of injuries.

1231~~~
Please explain this?
For me, if he manages to stay fit for a season. he'll soon make an international come back. Playing for United isn't the issue, playing for one of the largest clubs in the world gets a player in the spotlight & enhances his chances of getting picked.

1232~~~
Well not last year but the year before, he was arguably our player of the season along with Carrick. If that doesn't get him into the squad, god knows what will.

1233~~~
One reason I can think of is that when it comes to United players, people are chomping at the bit to tear down our players for the slightest mistake and when I say people, its not just the ABUs but, our own supporters. For some reason the so called neutrals are not as quick to focus in on players at other big clubs in this way. They may get criticism but, no where near IMO what a United player gets.

If you think about what's going on with Maicon and Alves, they are probably making similar errors if not worse than Rafael but, theirs will hardly get any pundits lambasting them. So Rafael while at United has the burden of continuously having small mistakes being blown out of proportion and the myth of him being rash, hot headed and unreliable will perpetuate - which will only continue to remind the people in charge of the mistake in the Olympics despite being brilliant throughout till that point. 

Funny thing is David Luiz who was responsible for Brazil failing on a lot bigger stage will not get the same treatment. Sucks for Rafael but, overall great for the club.

1234~~~
Surely losing 7-0 in a World Cup semi-final on home turf is worse than making a (albeit decisive) mistake in a Olympic final?

Out of interest, how many of the team that played against Germany in the World Cup are still in the international picture, I assume most of them?

1235~~~
Too much Politics involved in the running of the Brazil national team.

1236~~~
Shimo perfectly summed up my response here. I know too many opposition fans underrate Rafael and think he's not good enough for the national team when he's been one of the best Brazilian defenders currently playing. At this moment, particularly with Man. Utd. finishing 7th last season, there's no way Rafael will be rated unless we win the Champions League with him in the first team. Only then will non-Man.-Utd. fans start to rate Rafael (and many of our underrated players).

This is also another big reason. Third parties seem to have a decent influence in the players picked for the first team, and I'm sure the head coaches are also almost forced into picking players from the Brazilian league (again, due to politics).

Sadly, Rafael's frequently the odd one out of the Brazilians in Europe. I'd like to know if any of the Brazilian members here can tell us what Brazilians think of Rafael nowadays and whether they still underrate him.

1237~~~
That's a good point actually. Surely David Luiz has been given the feck off after his debacle?

1238~~~

1239~~~
What a great mentality he has. Rafael's not afraid of a bit of rain.

1240~~~

You give too much importance to English press in Brazil. The reason Rafael will not be called up to Brazil squad is because of the internal politics within the Brazilian FA.

The home nations agreement means he wouldn't be eligible for England even if he never played for Brazil.

He's a scholar banger.

1254~~~
He's so good when he gets a run of games (injuries being the cause). I think he's very underrated here by some even by those who love him, his crossing is some of the best we have too.

1255~~~
He'll be important against Chelsea (so without the risk of jinxing it, please don't get injured Rafa)

Essay <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1258~~~
A game of two halves. Brilliant attacking performance from him in the first half and a brilliant defensive performance in the second half.  He's my favourite bar none. 

The quotes from that MEN article are also fantastic:

 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> I don't want him to go anywhere else either.

1259~~~
I really hope he isn't replaced. The past year or so there's been constant speculation of neither Moyes nor van Gaal being fans of him.

1260~~~
Its really hard to understand why. The mirror are reporting we want Darmian to replace Rafa tonight. So strange..

1261~~~
Maybe some of it last season stemmed from him not being as good as the year before, but the same can be said for every other player. So it made no sense to single him out, especially as there were far worse.

This season, whilst it's early days, he's been fantastic. He came back from a long lay out against QPR and offered more attacking threat in 45 minutes than Valencia had so far this season. He was brilliant in Fergie's last season as well. Would be gutting to see him replaced.

1262~~~
He's been one of our best players this season as well.

1263~~~
I hope he's here for a long time. The rumours of Alves are annoying. He's half the player he used to be, and it's the very same player who is keeping Rafael from playing for Brazil. He certainly shouldn't be keeping him out of the United side too. If fit, Rafael should be playing. He just keeps getting better.

1264~~~
I don't think he'd be brought in as first choice anyways, we need cover for right back and that's exactly what Alves would be.

1265~~~
You'd hope so, but his wages would be quite high for a player being a back up only.

1266~~~
At this point I'd bring in Alves just to bench him so Rafael can start for the national team

1267~~~
Not strange considering rafa's injury record and the lack of depth in that position.

1268~~~
I wouldn't have a problem with that, but is Alves the kind of player who wants to be a backup? I can't see it.

1269~~~
Right back is one of the positions in a squad where you can have a reserve team player as your depth. If you want a more reliable back up option, you don't go and spend well over 100k a week on it.

1270~~~
Depth is fine. Rafael is fantastic though, and there's no way we should replace him.

1271~~~
He better not leave.

1272~~~
What was he even doing for their 2nd goal ? Hold the line.

Was okay today otherwise but he is brilliant in  home games this season.

1273~~~
For the second goal, yes he should of stepped up but I still can't get my head around Jones just blindly running after the ball. There was no need for him to do that and the space left behind ment there was noway Rafael could of covered for him.

Was good going forward again and got some great tackles in. Lets not talk about that shot though.... Nice link up play with Adnan but WBA defence cleared Rafael cross well.

1274~~~
Jones was going to win the ball. Yeah, it was rash but Rafael didn't need to cover. Just hold the line and Berainho was off.

Why was he even so deep ? Makes no sense.

1275~~~
Was Rafael level with Rojo for the goal? if so hard to blame him.

1276~~~
Was at fault for that goal but would hardly have been my prime candidate for criticism today.

1277~~~
Tracking the winger.

1278~~~
Probably slightly caught out in disbelief like us all that Jones just decided to up sticks and leave.

1279~~~
This. Not his fault. Our CBs fecked that up

1280~~~
He was indeed sloppy for their second goal, but I agree that Jones was all over the place for that goal - Rojo's pace trying to catch up with Berahino was bloody impressive though! 

That's my gripe with Jones; he is a little bit all over the place for my liking. If there ever was a player out of position it would be him.

1281~~~
Phil Jones alone did that by going for a ball that was never his to win. Absolute brainless defending. Furious with it.

1282~~~
One mistake does not take away his fantastic start.

1283~~~
And Shaws for the first. I hate idiocy like that. If you are not getting the ball at least make sure the man getting it in front of you wont be able to do anything with it

1284~~~
The point I was making was if Jones had of held his initial position and not ran after the ball unnecessary, there would not of been the gap for Beharinho to exploit. Beharinho was Jones man, not Rafaels. He was doing his job and has others said, there wasn't much in the offside. Jones is at a fault for the goal.

1285~~~
Rojo should have been covering across initially as well as Caragher just pointed out. There was no one else to mark and Shaw should come across.

What winger was there ? 

You don't track him beyond the line.

1286~~~
Thought he had a good game apart from stupidly playing Berahino onside.

1287~~~
Thought he was generally good today, though his link up with Adnan isn't anywhere as good as it is with others. Jones was primarily at fault for the 2nd goal imo.

1288~~~
Maybe he's there because he doesn't expect his bloody centre back to go run away from his station. Jesus, it's clear as day that Jones was at fault here.

1289~~~
Should be our captain on sunday with no Rooney, Fletcher or (hopefully) RvP.

1290~~~
Indeed.

1291~~~
The ball was too high up the pitch for him to be anyone's man. Blind was missing and too high and Jones went too rash i agree.

But when you are playing high pressing high line chasing the game those kind of things happen in the first line. Defensive organisation needs to be there to cover and hold the line.

For both goals you can point the finger at 3/4 people tbf each but it was overall organization to blame which comes down to LVG.

1292~~~
Are you blaming Rojo or claiming he made a good attempt?

1293~~~
Good going forward but everything he did got fecked up by breaking that line. It's always one of CBs that's drafting the line he has to stick to, it's a fecking schoolboy error.

And no, to me Jones ineptitude doesn't really justify him breaking the trap.

1294~~~
Could just be me picking up weird signals like a 14 year old girl, but the chemistry between Januzaj and Rafael down that line didn't seem all that great. They didn't play to each others strengths and Rafael made run after run without being used - I'm surprised he didn't stop trying...

1295~~~
I wouldn't blame Rafael for that one - we looked a bit 'high' to me, even before anything had happened.  A more defensive minded FB might have bailed out Jones, or better understanding as a unit, but these things happen.

1296~~~
It wasn't Rafaels fault. Jones lunged out like a maniac and we got caught.

1297~~~
He was slow to track the initial run covering across but then made a good attempt when he realized.

LVG just said that Jones doesn't need to push up but Lateral defenders need to cover and hold the line as well.

1298~~~
Same for me. As a fullback you can look straight across and see the line. There is absolutely no excuse to ever be that far behind the line.

1299~~~
Agreed, and the one time Adnan looked up and saw Rafael's run, he picked out a great ball to release him which should have been a goal. Think it might just be from lack of playing time so far this season, I can't remember any issue like that last year.

1300~~~
The backline at that instant was weird, Rafael was 2 yards deeper than Rojo, Shaw a yard further and Philistine was in midfield pressuring someone else. You can't fault one when you don't know what was supposed to be the point of reference.

1301~~~
Jones' fault for the goal, he was OK tonight. He didn't get enough overlaps, it's easier for him in the diamond.

1302~~~
I hope so. Where was RVP for that cross, btw?

1303~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Brilliant

1304~~~
Januzaj didn't use him enough in attack imo tonight. Got in some good positions but Januzaj held on to the ball too long.

1305~~~
Probably blame Jones moreso than Rafael. Although if he had stepped up it would have been offside. Apart from that though he was fine.

1306~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/ObIinPdPTD3/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

1307~~~
Think the goal was a collective thing.

You don't often get a player running through with no one near him with only defender at fault.

3 mistakes and that will happen. If even one of them doesn't make their respective mistake, we probably at least get close to him.

1308~~~
Clearly one of our best defenders and makes a huge difference to our attack.

Although was at fault along with Jones/Rojo for the second goal. As long as they can all stay fit then maybe we can actually start becoming a cohesive back four.

1309~~~
That vine shows our problems at the back atm. We aren't playing as a defence as a whole. Both full backs were deeper than the one CB in there and Jones should never of chased the ball. Obviously keep having to change the players hasn't helped with trying to build a solid back four. Was one of our most influential players again tonight.
EDIT:

1310~~~
I just noticed Rafael screaming at Berahino just when he was about to take his shot for the goal, obviously trying to throw him off <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1311~~~
Jones fault all the way for me.. no Full-back should be expected to deal with that.

1312~~~
EXACTLY what I said at the time - "If RVP isn't going to be in the box to put those away, he needs to be taken off"

That's the type of supply players like Falcao and Rooney will know to attack. Hopefully RVP starts on the bench for the City match.

1313~~~

1314~~~
With what? Offside trap?

1315~~~
No full back should be mindlessly playing an attacker onside. You could just as well argue that if Rafael had been in the correct position Berahino would have been offside and Jones' mistake wouldn't have mattered. It's called teamwork.

1316~~~
Wahahahaaaaaaaaa

1317~~~
Wouldn't of mattered anyway as over the other side of the pitch, Shaw was still behind Rojo and if Rafael had of stepped up, Shaw would of played him on instead.
Just to add that basically you mean Rafael should of expected Jones to make the mistake like that? Our line was too high as it was anyway but Rafael was in his position at full back. Jones was the one who went chasing after the ball leaving the space for Berahino to get in and we know that he has pace to burn. Teamwork isn't about knowing when your fellow defender will mess up.

1318~~~
No he wasn't.

A full back's position is to be in line with the deepest central defender. It's called maintaining  a defensive line. Basic defending. Rafael was at least 3 or 4 yards deeper than Rojo when Berahinho was slipped through.

1319~~~
Teamwork is about recovering the situation when your team mate messes up. That's what good teams do.

1320~~~
I feel sorry for Rafael. Everyone at work blames him for the dropped points. It's a shame that people just have this opinion of him and every mistake he makes gets blown out of proportion. I was saying that he played well except one mistake but all people say is that he cost us the game with that error. It makes me <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1321~~~
With the lack of pressure we usually put on the ball, we'll concede 10 goals in the next 2 games if we play with a line that high. Need Herrera and Di Maria central and fit.

1322~~~
It's silly to blame him for the lost points, he had an excellent game overall, but he's at fault for their second goal. Jones was stupid as well, but no way should Rafael be deeper than a CB, big mistake. Still one of our best players though.

1323~~~
Yesterdays match just sums up Rafael in 90 min. Great going forward, good overall, defending is solid. And then he brainfarts and cost us points.

1324~~~
It's definitely Rafael fault, he shouldn't shout at Berahino. I think he startled him which result in a good shot. If not De Gea will save it!

1325~~~
But we would not be having this conversation if Jones hadn't of left his position. I agree for some reason our full backs are getting pulled to far apart from the center halves but regardless if Rafael was in line with Rojo and if Berahino was in line with them two, there still was so much space to get into because Jones went wondering. 
Just to add as coolredwine pointed out, what was Rojo doing anyway. He had no one to mark and saw Jones headless chicken run. The danger was on our right side of the pitch so should of covered as well.

1326~~~
You can put it the other way round and ask what Rojo/Jones were doing defending at the center line!

1327~~~
Good teams don't mess up a lot though. Our trouble atm is we do a mistake and the opposition manage to score every time. Just like last night where we probably looked our most solid defensively. Two errors from our defence gives WBA there only two shots on target and they score two goals.

1328~~~
If wishes were fishes...

It's possible for two defenders to feck up in the same sequence of events. Which is what happened last night. 

West Brom might have scored if Jones was the only defender to make a mistake, the fact him and Rafael <i>both</i> screwed up made it almost inevitable.

1329~~~
Well yes, but nonetheless the fullback is meant at the very least to line up on his CB. That they were too high or that Jones completely went AWOL is another question. The fact of the matter is that his poor positioning kept Berahino onside, and that Berahino went on to score. I absolutely love Rafael and as I said he was actually very good in this match and since the beginning of the season, but that doesn't change he's at fault here.

1330~~~
Just added to my other message but will post here. You have to question Rojo as well. He did not cover for Jones either.

Btw, I am not disputing that Rafael isn't at fault. He played him onside. But There was a collective of errors from multiple defenders that costs us that goal. When you look at the replay last night, both Rafael and Shaw were further back than Rojo. So regardless of Rafael stepping up, shaw would of played him on. Jones shouldn't of done what he did, both fullbacks should be in line but that was a much too high line and Rojo should of helped to cover for Jones. Ultimately, it was still a great finish that Berahino scored from. But it is silly errors that costs us again last night which I think in time, especially the issues with the offside and lack of communication, the more they play together, the more of a unit they will become. Jones still needs to cut out the headless chicken act though. Can't do that as a central defender.

1331~~~
Yup. All three of them could have defended it better. If I had to put their errors in order of severity, I would say 1. Jones 2. Rafael 3. Rojo

It's all nit-picking though. We haven't been defending as a unit all season. Their second goal epitomised the lack of communication and coordination in our defending. Which is a big problem but has to be mainly down to our inability to play the same back four for two games in a row. All four of them cocked up at different times last night but I'd still pick all four of them on Sunday. Onwards and upwards from here, hopefully.

1332~~~
Just added to my last post again but basically agree with you completely. I still believe it was our best game this season defensively.

1333~~~
Yeah both Centre-backs were caught too square. If Jones goes then Rojo has to position himself to cover and vice-versa. Hopefully that understanding will come with time but at this point in time I don't think they should be trying to play such a high-line so that they have a bit more room for error. Plus playing a high-line requires the midfield to press much much more sharply than they did last night.

1334~~~
I wouldn't want to blame him though. He has been getting the blame for every little thing since last season. This time too, as we were stupidly standing at the half line for some random reason and he and Rojo were left to cover up after Jones left a big gap there. Doubt anyone could have done anything if the central defenders plan to step up the pitch without even communicating.

1335~~~
Agreed and also I think Rojos english isn't great, so that wont help with communication, but with time they will start playing as a defence and not a bunch of defenders.

1336~~~
I would want to see another angle of the goal. From the normal camera angle, it seems both Rafael and Shaw were in line while Jones/Rojo has stepped up.

1337~~~
Me too.

1338~~~
When are people going to wake up to what I have saying for ages - he can't defend. This is nowhere near the first time he has played the opposition onside. That sort of thing would be crucified even at Under 12's level.

1339~~~
Are you from the group that also believes Kyle Walker is better than Rafael?

1340~~~
No!  He can't defend either!  Don't worry, I don't expect a lot of people to see it yet, I tend to see things quite early.

1341~~~
See things early? Or very selectively wait for chances to prove a point. Having personally watched Raf have many top class wingers in his pocket in certain games, I can say conclusively, he can actually defend. He just has lapses & off games, where he makes errors, this does not mean he cannot defend, it just means he's human & makes mistakes. 
For me if the lad stays fit, he's one of the best right backs in world football. Just a shame he never seems to get a good run of games, before he breaks.

1342~~~
Everything is better than Rafael

1343~~~
Really really rate this lad, but he has cost us points 2 times this season already, while he isnt playing bad, and has been excellent at times. That's a bad thing imo, to not reward good play, Rooney is like the complete opposite, doesnt play well at times, but he will end up with a goal or at least an assist.

1344~~~
I guess we'll see if my point is correct in January / next summer, if LVG buys a new right back. I might be wrong, hope I am.

1345~~~
But that is a pointless argument as we know we need another RB. Rafael is our only senior RB and when the cover is Valencia (Janko isn't ready for the step up, not sure with Vermijl if he will make it or not), pretty much everyone agrees Jones and Smalling should never play full back again. So that leaves Rafael as our only RB.

1346~~~
Who would you suggest we replace him with though? Any RBs I can think of who might be available either A) aren't good enough, B) are also weak relatively defensively or C) aren't good enough going forward to suit the way we play.

1347~~~
Do you have a video that shows Shaw further back because the one I'm looking at he is in line with Rojo making Berahino offside. In this video at 2:25 you can see Shaw and Rojo lined up and at 2:34 you can see Rafael is a couple of yards back.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KUIEIzkz3Sc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Video just above

1348~~~
Rafael is a couple of yards back, but Shaw is playing Berahino onside.

1349~~~
Maybe I'm blind but I have it paused with the ball on Brunt's foot as he is about to play the ball and Berahino is clearly behind Shaw.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i61.tinypic.com/r90iah.png" src="http://i61.tinypic.com/r90iah.png"/>

1350~~~
Jones <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Honestly what went through his head there.

1351~~~
The point at 2:33-2:34. Both Shaw and Berahino are in line.

1352~~~
I place no blame on him for the dropped points. He is a warrior and the best right back in the league. I see him as an alternative to Rooney as captain.

1353~~~
They aren't though. You can see with the lines in the grass that they aren't. It is the exact same as at 2:25 which I print screened and it shows they aren't in line.

1354~~~
Curious to know the reasons why a lot of people think that he'd be a great captain?

Nothing against Rafael, he's one of my favourite players, and he certainly has a strong mentality I just don't see him as a captain, and would be interested in understanding the reasons why others think he would be a good captain.

1355~~~
Tbh, I can think of a couple of reasons and like you, he is my favourite player at united but also do not think he is ready to be captain. One day perhaps. First being the way he plays on the pitch. Always gives 100% and clearly loves playing for united and understands what the club is all about. The other being that in the summer we lost 4 very experienced players in which means Rafael becomes in affect, one of our senior players at 24 now. I think only Fletcher, Rooney and Evans have been at the club longer than Rafael now. Then the other reason is because we don't have a stand out candidate for captain.

1356~~~
Yeah shaw was clearly in line with Rojo the entire time. Rafael was caught further back so it's in part his fault, but also Jones' for stepping out as he did. I don't think we were trying to catch them offside or anything, Rafael just fell asleep a bit and was caught out.

1357~~~
I think the criticism on Rafael is harsh.
He could've (and maybe should have) done better for their second goal, but people should be a bit more realistic.
You can't expect any player to be perfect. Rafael has been one of our main attacking forces this season while being solid at the back as well.
Apart from maybe Lahm there's no fullback in world football who is as great going forward and doesn't make any mistakes at the back. 

The press has created an image of Rafael being an attacking fullback who isn't capable of defending and who is a red card waiting to happen.
Unfortunately, some of our fans have adopted that view. Most of those also rate Zabaleta as the best fullback in the PL, a player who is without a doubt as rash as Rafael in terms of tackling and also picks up a lot of cards, yet he doesn't get a reputation...

The problem with our defence isn't Rafael, it isn't Jones, Rojo or Shaw either. It's them working as a unit.
On paper, the best defences in world football are teams like Chelsea, Atletico Madrid, Juventus etc. Defences consisting of 3 or 4 players who've played together week in, week out for several years now and are very experienced.

Against WBA, we played with a defence with an average age of just over 22 years old. For anyone not following other teams, that's insanely young for a defence at this level. Add to that, that it was only the first time those 4 have played a competitive game together at the back and it should give them some credit. Buying all those top attacking players shouldn't mean that we have the right to criticise any defensive player who makes a mistake. More so than the attacking line, defending is about experience. Not just experience as a defender, but as a unit. When they've played a number of games with the same defenders, they start to anticipate their fellow defender's actions and adjust to that. You can't expect that in their first game together though. 
Rafael is our oldest defender and he's 24 years old. 
Azpilicueta is Chelsea's youngest defender and he's 25 years old.
As a Man Utd supporter that's something to be proud of. We may be leaking goals now, but this is just the start. If those 4 stay clear of too many injuries, this is only the start for them. We're not a team competing for the title yet, but at least the defence is only going to get better. Another quality defender is certainly welcome, but we've got time on our side.

We've bought some superstar attacking players this summer, but even though our defence is making some mistakes, they display one of the reasons I'm a Man Utd supporter. We build our teams and keep our confidence in our young and talented players. In the end, we reap the benefits and it's 10 times as satisfying than buying a whole top defensive line because we know we developed them. We didn't bench them after one mistake for a more experienced player. We gave them the chance to learn from their faults and fulfill their potential.

This may cost us a 3rd place finish this season, it may even cost us a CL-spot. But if these players keep progressing, we will only get better.
In just 2 years time, apart from Mangala and Azpilicueta, our 2 strongest competitors' first team defenders will be on the decline, while our current players will -hopefully- have progressed a lot and will still be getting better. 

They all made mistakes, but if they get spared too many injuries, there's a lot of potential in this defence. Mistakes are a part of the learning progress. Forgiving them and keeping the faith in our young defence's potential is what sets us apart from some of our rivals. Let's keep it that way.

1358~~~
It was a combination of 3 mistakes 1. Rafael not being in line nullifying any possible offside trap  2. Jones going for a ball he had no right trying for when the line was already high (similar to Shaw on goal #1) and 3. Rojo not covering for Jones wild lunge by moving centrally as he had no one marking

1359~~~
Hes my favourite player but with any attacking player,  he will be prone to be capitalised on if he does not have a proper unit behind him.  Considering he was either the oldest or second oldest player in our defense at the age of 24 shows that we lack experiance heads.  We need them because it allows rafael and shaw to freely push on and provide the natural width we have missed in our games. 

When we played 5 at the back with wingers,  that was not some flukey idea van gaal has,  its his idea on how football should be played. 

He wants our wingers and wingbacks to be the same, gaurding the whole sides of the pitch,  which allows the DM to drop between the left  and right centreback creating a fluid back three. 

He is a genius,  having watched ajax i can tell you he is on to something here.  He is still changing the formation around to accommodate his players,  but we will benefit the same way the dutch benefited from his brief time there,  extending tonthe future.

For example,  if rafael went forward to provide a cross,  jones shifts to the right to cover him,  in turn allowing space for our DM to fall in to cover jones.  This means we never have less than 4 defenders no matter whether rafael or shaw provides the width.

1360~~~
I thought the same about Rojo but after watching it again I don't really see how he could've got accross. Even if he'd moved as soon as Jones flung forward it would've been too late.

I'm not sure why we were playing such a high line, but if you're going to play that way it's criminal to be a full-back and be 5 to 10 yards further back than your teammates.

Saying all that, it's a back four with two new players so we have to expect some mistakes.

1361~~~
No, Rafael can't defend at all, he's rubbish, a waste off space, I can remember against West Ham when we were down to 10 men, he was the worst defender, no actually he was the worst player on the pitch.
A bit of a knee-jerk reaction don't you think.
He is a very good RB, solid as that, against Leicester he didn't touch the player and had a penalty rewarded against, you should condemn the player for diving not Rafael. Against West Brom Jones should be condemned for running into no mans land and leaving the defensive line not Rafael. Rafael's positioning is a result of Jones, he stayed back hesitantly knowing Jones was going to feck up.

1362~~~
I am quite happy to have Rafael as our RB but he is so skillful on the ball that I have always wondered if he would not make an excellent winger. At least he would not be as one-dimensional as Valencia.

1363~~~
Nah, it will never work. Players like him are best running from deeper positions which make them more effective. If he starts high up then he doesn't really have that space to work with. He'll do a beter job than Valencia but that's nothing to shout about.

1364~~~
Really like Rafael myself....he doesnt usually fall asleep positionally like against west brom, and some may argue that the CB's should be communicating to him better. But going forward he's great, fitness is good. And he's usually really solid defensively. At times in his career for spells I thought he's been one of the best in the prem.

1365~~~
It's quite strange to think he's been here for 7 years now and played his 100th match. Not bad. I still think of him as a youngster who gets to fill in eventhough he's one of most experienced players in defence at the moment!! His best years are just starting to come. He's a very different type of player with all that aggressision and technique.

1366~~~
He's been one of our most consistent post-Ferguson, but I'm still not utterly convinced. Rather than going through good and bad spells he'll play at a decent level for months on end then suddenly have an absolute shocker, but then recover from it immediately and pick up where he left off. I remember Fergie taking him off after about 30 minutes a few seasons ago, but you wouldn't know it in his next game. EDIT: It was vs Reading it 2012 <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/premier-league-best-and-worst-rafael-is-man-utds-incredible-sulk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">(article here)</a> and he skulked off <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Agree he's great going forward, can score too, and doesn't seem to get broken much. Jury's out for me.

1367~~~
idiotic for the yellow. could still cost us.

1368~~~
He has crazy moments. But can't fault his effort as always.

1369~~~
Very worried that he will pick up a second yellow in the next half. Needs more help on that right flank against hazard.

1370~~~
Real shame about that yellow. Done well otherwise.

1371~~~
Kept Hazard out the game but got a silly yellow. Di Maria isn't backing him up at all. If Herrera was fit enough, this game would of been perfect for him to help with Hazard. Oh and that run for the FK was pretty good.

1372~~~
This systme offers him no help 1v1 against Hazard. Going to be some nervy times in the second half...

1373~~~
I still wish we'd had a new RB on the shopping list in the summer, someone who can really be disciplined.
Why does he always do that thing where under pressure he tries to blindly clear the ball into play? Half the time it goes straight to a Chelsea player and he's out of position.  He's just too focused on attack.

1374~~~
It's his first card of the season, I'm sure he can manage another 45 minutes without picking up a second.

1375~~~
Who's bright idea was it to have him marking Didier fecking Drogba?! <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1376~~~
As much as it was ludicrous to have him marking Drogba, his defending for that goal was still kind of terrible. No one is expecting him to beat Drogba in an aerial battle, but he was just lagging behind, not really doing anything to stop Drogba at all.

1377~~~
To be fair, Drogba gave him a nudge to get all the room. Don't think there's much he could have done.

After his idiotic yellow, I thought he did fine.

1378~~~
True. It probably looked a lot worse in slow motion, where it looked as if he had a lot more time to recover and try to challenge Drogba.

1379~~~
He pissed me off with that completely idiotic yellow card but he seemed to calm down after that. He shouldn't be marking Drogba but that's the kind of thing that needs to be organised by leaders on the pitch, of which we have very few

1380~~~
Thought he did well today, the yellow was soft but he can't really complain. Kept hazard quite on the flank and made some good attacking runs.

1381~~~
Delighted with his performance today really. There's not much he could do with the Drogba goal but where he impressed me was his maturity. I think all of us expected him to get sent off the second half but he was calm and didn't do anything rash and was decent going forward.

1382~~~
That's the kind of thing which should be sorted in training during the week and it looks like Rafael was meant to be marking Drogba. Fellaini was being used as some sort of floater that would attack the ball. There are also Terry, Ivanovic, Matic, and Cahill to mark. These are things the manager should have plans for, the leaders on the pitch don't just figure out who is marking who when the time comes.

1383~~~
Sweet reward of maturity and experience. Rafael of 2+ years ago would have been sent off in the second half.

1384~~~
The yellow was stupid but at least he was able to remain calm and not get sent off afterwards. Was good today.

1385~~~
I think he gets a lot of undeserved stick. I don't think he cocks up any more than the average right back, and he has a lot more upside than most. 

It's ridiculous that people don't see the tangible, and massive difference when he's not playing. He brings the ball out of defence reliably and rapidly, he makes space for whoever's playing on the same flank and he's one of the few players who actually tries to make stuff happen when we're losing.

If you look at what he's getting stick for today - a silly booking, only to play 80 minutes without much trouble defensively and then getting beaten in the air by someone who's 6 inches taller than him and built like a sh*tbrickhouse.

1386~~~
I love this guy, he's just so good! Controlled Hazard very well, silly yellow though. Such an asset to the team though!

1387~~~
Started off shakily but then good display of maturity.

And he keeps going and going till the end.

1388~~~
He makes a huge difference to us in regards to bringing the ball out from the back. We instantly looked better when he came back into the team a month or so ago. Did pretty well today after a worrying early yellow. Kept Hazard reasonably well handled all things considered.

1389~~~
Lots of spirit as always but also showed real maturity today due to being on a yellow for most of the game against one of the best wide men in the world. Personally I thought the yellow he got was harsh, it was his first foul of the game and Matic did the same thing afterwards and got nothing.

1390~~~
Another very good game. Up against one of the best in Hazard, dealt with him well over the 90 minutes. Some tough moments but you have to expect that against Chelsea and Hazard but overall I thought he did well.

1391~~~
If it wasn't Rafael would any one mention that yellow? Probably not.

It was actually a very good card to take, had feck all cover and was beaten by Hazard (for the only time over the 90 minutes) much better to have your right back on a yellow card for 80 minutes than go 1 down.

I genuinely wouldn't swap him for anyone in the world, the boys got everything and its brushed over because he's 'rash'. Nonsense.

1392~~~
Exactly. Full backs the length and breadth of the land have been shredded by Hazard, Rafa stands him up and some wanna have a go? Bet Wenger would've had Chambers play Hazard like Rafa did!

1393~~~
Those two things annoy me a lot! Ivanovic was doing constant niggly tackles but they never comment on him.

As for Rafael, thought he was brilliant. He doesn't get enough credit for his defending. That yellow card aside, Hazard did not get any joy down our right hand side at all. The only time he did get going, he went inside through the middle. Also, neither full back had cover from their wingers today, so Rafael was dealing with Hazard on his own for most of the game. I don't know whose idea it was to put Rafael on Drogba for set pieces and we also had Shaw on Cahill! Attacking wise, got forward not as much as he had liked but put in some great runs. Great game from Rafael.

1394~~~
It was a stupid booking because he sold himself. Hazard isn't going to do anything on the touch line if Rafael just stands a yard off him. He made it easy for Hazard.

1395~~~
He seems to have seemingly boundless amounts of energy, just never stops.

1396~~~
Brilliant today apart from the silly yellow. He's the one player you can't trust on a yellow because he just loses it sometimes, but tbf today he kept his cool well. I was surprised at how little Chelsea tried to exploit that card, but part of the reason for that was Rafael did so well. He anticipated and cut-out a lot of danger by marking tight and making early challenges.

Now, just stay fit please!

1397~~~
Really pleased how disciplined he was after that early yellow. Very mature response. Good stuff.

1398~~~
I heard it was a mix up of communication between Fellaini and him.

1399~~~
Fellaini was marking Cahill at that corner I think and was at the back post. Although at times (other corners) Fellaini seemed to be marking Drogba. I'm not sure what the plan was for him really. Rafael was solid. Played Hazard well at times and got into trouble a couple of times too but that happens when you play Hazard because he's quality.

1400~~~
He is weirdly the catalyst for most of our attacks.  Some of the balls he played when januzaj moved to the right were exquisite.

1401~~~
I was going to make this exact point. 

You see yellows like that basically every game and nothing is said about it, but Rafael picks up his first yellow of the season and its evidence that he is "impetuous" according to Neville.

1402~~~
It's because as someone mentioned above, he's just so filled with energy and tenacity. He don't give up, and that just seeps through into the attackers and increases the tempo. It isn't that rare seeing a fullback dictate attacking play, really. Baines and Coleman are Everton's key attackers.

1403~~~
I felt really sick after he received the yellow card straight away, but he showed some real maturity after that and played a really good match overall. Considering he played with that booking for around 80 minutes against one of the best dribblers in the world, makes it even more impressive. Well done.

1404~~~
Tell me how did he get a yellow card and yet 6 mins later or something the exact same foul was executed at the other end and even though Mata and maybe RVP, im not sure, brought Dowds attention to it, he waved it off. Either both are yellow or none of them are!! Simple as.

There seems to be this misconception that we got away with stuff for years and its time to take everything we get and shut up about it. This season alone we had at least 5 good penalty claims that we didn't get a look in. It looks like an opposition member needs to take a machete to a United player before we get a pen. However that said... I thought Phil Dowd had a good game that missed yellow aside. I don't get all this penalty claims from the corner. Every corner is a penalty if that's the case. There is no defending team who don't foul at EVERY corner and foul is a foul no matter how blatant or not. Shawcross was just unlucky last week to be the one who it gets called on, so its in fashion for these 2 weeks. 

NOW back to Mr De Silva... I thought he was good without setting the world alight. Was solid, defended well, covered well, closed down well and protected that yellow card well. Still more of an attacker than a defender and as such he needs to be drilled as to when to over lap, when to cut in, when to take on a man and when to 1-2 it. To fit into the system he is needed to play. 
He has yet to show the level of defending that i would like from a right full but what you gain on the swings you lose on the roundabouts. Can't fault his attitude and his willingness to get up and down the field. Needs to build on this, I'd rather have him than any the others at right back. But maybe its a position that needs adjustment in the windows. There is a certain 26 year old, Irish Toffee that would suit us well, but he wont be cheap. Maybe a swap plus cash?

1405~~~
My only real complaint is sometimes he gets too tight to attackers on the wrong side or wrong situation as seen with Hazard in the game. I cant put my finger on it but there is a bit of Gary Neville about him. I think maybe its his energy.

1406~~~
Could just be the quality of the winger forcing Rafa to go to the wrong side? He definitely was close to Hazard a lot. Didn't want to allow Hazard to run and dribble, which makes sense. Risky if he slips him though, like he did for the yellow.

1407~~~
After the yellow, he proved that he matured over the years

1408~~~
Feared the worst after the yellow but excellent after that.

1409~~~
He has this tag of being liable to make mistakes now, irrespective of the fact he very rarely makes mistakes of any consequence now. If you consider someone like Kompany who has made a good few mistakes in the last year or so and compare the coverage he gets to Rafael and you see how unfair it is on his behalf.

1410~~~
It was a silly piece of defending for him to get himself booked, though.

<span style="font-size: 9px">&lt;runs away&gt;</span>

Did well after, though.

1411~~~
Not his best game. He didn't impose himself as much as he normally does, but he did keep Hazard quiet for most of the game. A bit more lacklustre in attack than he normally is, but he was probably told to show some restraint in attack.

1412~~~
somebody in the coaching staff saw a video of him outjumping Peter Crouch !

1413~~~
Chelsea were very good organized, it was quite difficult for him to find space to whip a cross in I thought. Di Maria wasn’t helping much either. When Januzaj played on the right in the closing stages he made some good runs.

Anyway, his offensive contribution is very good most of the time so I’m not worried. On the other side, it was really impressive how calm he remained during the game after that early yellow. Keep it up.

1414~~~
Van Gaal mentioned in the post match that there was some sort of miscommunication between him and Fellaini <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1415~~~
One of our top three players yesterday. Well done Rafael.

1416~~~
Fellani was told to mark Drogba but Matic, who's about 6'3, came into the box for the corner when they scored. Fellani got caught trying to mark Matic for the corner.

It was good tactics from Chelsea, Matic came into the box, waited for Fellani to pick him up and then he left the area and stood on the edge, leaving Fellani marking no one and miles away from Drogba.

One of the biggest culprits for the goal in my opinion was Van Persie. If he stayed on the line he would have cleared that easily.

1417~~~
It was his yellow card which resulted in the game being messy and flooded in yellow cards. Bar the one missed earlier in the game (i think it was Ivanovic) Dowd had to give yellow cards for any pesky foul - which is why there were 8 Yellow cards and 1 red in the game - despite the game not being dirty at all. Thankfully/Luckily, it worked to our advantage in the end.

1418~~~
Rafael on Drogba was throughout the match - so that was a coached thing. The miscommuniation LVG was referring to that one particular play in that we ended up 3 players on 2 at the back side and possibly Fellaini could have communicated to Rafa that he'll come take Drogba. 

Am sure those things happen almost every set piece play, someone could have done something different but, because most don't end up in goals, they don't get broken down the way that one corner was.

1419~~~

Text:<a class="externalLink" href="http://instagram.com/manchesterunited" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@manchesterunited</a> #manchesterunited great atmosphere yesterday great goal.

1420~~~
Defended well against one of the trickiest players in football, there wasn't much going forward for either of our full backs because how Mourinho had Hazard and William situated, over all another decent performance.

1421~~~
Michael Cox's analysis

<b><i>Chelsea’s right-sided midfielder Willian took up some very narrow, deep positions throughout the game, offering short-passing options for his centre-backs rather than seeking to spin in behind and receive long balls. As a result it presented the Manchester United left-back Luke Shaw with a problem – should he stay in position alongside his centre-backs, or stick tightly to Willian?

Van Gaal had evidently urged him to stick tight, because Shaw was never more than five metres from Willian, sometimes advancing ahead of his midfielders to track the Brazilian. This epitomised the bravery of United’s full-backs – with and without the ball – and their aggressiveness pushed back Chelsea’s wide players.

On the opposite flank Rafael da Silva’s unnecessary early caution for a foul on Eden Hazard was extremely worrying – but while other full-backs would keep their position and ensure they did not find themselves on the wrong side of the opposition’s danger-man, Da Silva continued to push forward. Hazard was forced back into his own half – and his final act was being cautioned for a foul on Da Silva, summing up the role-reversal.</i></b>

1422~~~
I think once shaw improves his attacking game we will be much more attacking as a unit. Sometimes i feel we are lop sided with rafael attacking more than shaw.  Its clear van gaal wants our natural width from our fullbacks while our wingers cut inside to provide more midfield numbers.

1423~~~
This. A lot of players look foolish going up against Hazard. Rafael did very well, especially considering the early booking. He also linked up well in attack with Januzaj and the two looked like a promising partnership (though I doubt we will see much of it as I imagine we will go back to two strikers now that Rooney is back)

1424~~~
Needs a more mature game today than usual in our big matches.

He's been getting praise for last week but I think the early booking meant he was afraid to get involved after that. If its Milner/Nasri over there I think Rafa should be able to cope.

1425~~~
Like Jones......Rafael is a joke

Some bodies aren't made for football

I don't think Van Gaal will keep him.....too injury-prone

1426~~~
Not on the bench, must be injured. Hope it's not serious.

1427~~~
This is fecking tiresome now.

1428~~~

1429~~~
a new RB was on my shopping list for last summer. It just kills us to keep on having to go half seasons with the likes of Valencia or Jones or Smalling "doing a job" at right back. I'm sure it will be addressed next summer, but it's going to cost us again this season.

1430~~~
It doesn't bother me that he is injured as much as it will bother others. the issue is we don't have a decent back-up. If we did then it would not matter as much. We need to sort that out ASAP. Valencia doesn't cut it.

1431~~~
I'm sure he's as annoyed as us. Quit the insults. 

We do desperately need cover and competition for Rafael and I expect Van Gaal to bring somebody in as early as January.

1432~~~
Jeez, played the last 6 games on the bounce and puts in some great performances for us,  after little preseason and misses a game due too a knock, cue the: always injury prone, not worth it etc.

1433~~~
Coleman, Piszczek, Clyne or even Dani Alves

I'm really sick of players like Rafael and Jones

1434~~~
Maybe we should just drop playing with defenders until the next transfer widow? Let's aim to win games 10-9.

1435~~~
I like the guy but it seems we should invest in RB too....

1436~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1437~~~
Was pictured training on friday, so if he did it thursday and back in the next day, can't be a bad one.

1438~~~
For all the moaning about our training regimes, why is it that it's always the usual suspects that picks up knocks in trainings?

Jones, Rafael, Smalling, Evans.

1439~~~
we definitely need another right back. I like Rafa but he's far too injury prone to be relied upon.

1440~~~
Really bad news. We really do need to sign a right back. Valencia at right back, when Rafael is injured, is a scary prospect.

1441~~~
Makes me wish we still had Fabio, to be honest.

1442~~~
At this point I'm starting to wonder about trade-offs between training sessions that keep players match fit versus increased injury risk.  I just don't hear about players getting hurt in practice as much in American Football or basketball.

1443~~~
Chambers would have been a good investment in the summer.

We should go for Dani Alves or any other avaliable right back in January, we just can't count with Rafael for a season.

1444~~~
Two of Jones, Smalling, Evans and Rafael aren't going to make it here, imo.

1445~~~
For all the moaning about our training regimes, why is it that it's always the usual suspects that picks up knocks in trainings?

Jones, Rafael, Smalling, Evans.

1446~~~
Players like Dani Alves, with nothing left to prove other than how much money they can make in their 30s, really aren't the kind of signings we should be making, for what it's worth.

1447~~~
Rafael being injured is hardly "news" is it?

1448~~~
Xabi Alonso plays for Bayern Munich like he has won nothing at all in his career so.........

If Dani Alves would join QPR then i agree with you.....but a move to us can give players like Dani Alves a "new life"

1449~~~
I think they do get hurt, but those sports, particularly American Football, seem to have greater scope for playing with a knock, than football does. It takes something pretty catastrophic to keep an American Footballer out (ex. torn ACL.)

1450~~~
Made out of fecking glass.

1451~~~
Would people be incline to agree with me that he's in need of proper competition for the RB spot? I have really tried to defend his inconsistency but it's getting really tough now.

1452~~~
I don't know how the competition is going to help him with his injuries - and apart from them he is one of our best and most consistent performers. What do you mean by inconsistency?
He needs a decent cover though

1453~~~
Sometimes I almost feel depressed when I see these threads being bumped right before a match. Just gutted to see yet another defender go down with an injury in training.

Rafael was critical to our attack/defence and really provided us with a presence on the right flank. Big loss for us.

1454~~~
I wouldn't go that far. Have you forgotten his last few performances in a United shirt?

1455~~~
And... Falcao <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1456~~~
We need adequate back up but seriously. he has picked up a knock and trained the following day after getting it. One missed game on here (and this isn't directed and you) and everyone is like, oh he is always injured, isn't good enough, made of glass etc. Except that he misses one game and in all the other games he has played, he has been one of our best and influential players.
I'm guessing you haven't been watching him since the Swans match? But to the previous post, no. Fabio isn't good enough for us but better than where he is at currently.

1457~~~
It does always seem to be those 4 - I dont know if there are any stats out there of how many games any have managed to play without getting injured. TBF Evans did start pretty regularly a couple of seasons ago.

1458~~~
van Gaal just said 'Rafael is injured....again'.

There can't be much room in the sort of small squad that van Gaal says he favours for injury-prone players, I would have thought.

Come on Rafael, stay fit mate.

1459~~~
No, I haven't to be honest. But however he is doing in the Championship is impossible to apply to how he would have been doing if he'd never left, which is the post I was responding to.

1460~~~
He got injured once.. 
So he's not an usual suspect.

1461~~~
We need a back up. I'm not looking forward to Valencia on the right again ffs

1462~~~
Rafael should be the back-up next season......we need a new first choice RB
I'm 100% sure Van Gaal thinks so too (Van Gaal has said a few minutes ago "Rafael? Well he's injured.......again"

1463~~~
I know but I was just responding about your comment on his last appearance in united shirt, which I felt was a little harsh. For whatever reason Moyes left him out after that one start v palace. Sent to the u-21s and then only comes on in the cup match because rio got injured. So was chucked in a bit and sadly that seems to be peoples memories of fabio. When he did put in some good games for us. Few and far between due too his injuries obviously. But, like I said in his thread. He stays fit and plays well like he is, will be a good buy for mid table teams in PL. Not us though.

1464~~~
From fridays training session: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/rafael-da-silva-of-manchester-united-in-action-during-a-news-photo/458166052" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail...nited-in-action-during-a-news-photo/458166052</a>

1465~~~
Surely know he has to be a backup next season his injury record is not good enough for United.

1466~~~
My question has nothing to do with his current injury or injury record but his inconsistent mentality. Offensively he's fine but defensively he still has those annoying lapses and it does cost us.

1467~~~
we really did a bad decision sending Varela to Madrid. He was ready to step up even at the end of the last season. He is natural successor to Rafael, very similar in style, could play both flanks, now we have to stick with Valencia.  How much Azpilacueta would cost? also can cover both flanks as well as Clyne.. but maybe I´m getting carried away too much..

1468~~~
I meant it's not just the usual suspects as Falcao picked up an injury too. It's obviously more of a worry with the 4 originally mentioned though, as it's the same old story with them.

1469~~~
Can't agree with you at all.

1470~~~
I'd agree with you there.

1471~~~
Players get hurt all the time-but (and maybe it's an incorrect perception) not so much in practice. In fact, Amercan football teams have drastically changed their practice routines in response to research on the impact of collisions in practice on head injuries. Most American football teams will limit contact drills during the season to limit injuries. 

I'm wondering if something similar should be thought about for football (soccer). Or, maybe, United are just unlucky.

1472~~~
We're going to see a fresh backline next season and Rafa as much as I rate him won't be first choice. I'm predicting we'll see a new RB and two CB's.

1473~~~
We should be capable of picking up talented full backs via our scouting system. Blasting a shitload on wages for Alves, who I'd only want as cover, is not the route I want to see the club head down. Screams Maicon to me. I take your point regarding Alonso but all cases are individual. I still think he's a good signing for any top club, probably on reasonable wages.

1474~~~
Alves wouldn't be my first choice.....Coleman or Piszczek would be great

1475~~~
I'd still prefer him over Valencia at RB. As a backup, I'd have no problem with him.

1476~~~
Was obvious we would miss him today and I don't mean in the fact that Valencia is our only back up RB and can't defend. He gives a lot to the team and always looks for the forward pass and a willing runner. We are getting thrashed down our right today, every time City attack.

1477~~~
Forget Rooney, this man is our most important outfield player.

1478~~~
Yup.  When i woke up and saw the first xi,  i had a feeling we would be up against it.  He starts or plays apart in all of our attacks.

1479~~~
Very true. Think we missed him going forward more than anything. I think Valencia got into an advanced position once in the whole game.

1480~~~
Any news about the injury?

1481~~~
And decided to hit the first defender with a cross.

1482~~~
Valencia did okay, but Rafael definitely would've been an improvement. Once again we're let down by his injuries though. I hope van Gaal intends to be as ruthless as I'd be with the majority of our defenders.

1483~~~
If only he had an identical twin to play half the games he'll miss through injury...

1484~~~
We certainly need a new RB, if only to cover for and compete with Rafael. Having to play a converted winger or CB there really hurts us every time.

1485~~~
Bored of his injuries, we need to bring in a top RB to challenge him, if he stays fit and wins the competition for the place then good on him, if not then we move on without him.

1486~~~
Just to point out, for league appearances so far this season, Rafael is only behind Rojo and played more than the other senior defensive players.

1487~~~
I've no doubt he will be but as manager he's also got to be pragmatic. We all know what needs fixing but we can't move players on until we've got the right people to come in and by that I mean not just like for like replacement of average and injury prone players.

1488~~~
We really paid for not having him today.  Someone countered my argument, saying that Rafael might've been out of position for the goal anyway but I would much rather have him defending against that cross than Valencia.

It is really insane that we have no comparable backup for Rafael, at least in terms of attacking skills.  You could see from the start today that we're only one-third of an attacking team without him, since Valencia stayed back most of the game and Januzaj had no side outlet to work with.

I'm in agreement with a lot of you, we need to sign a good attacking RB who can push Rafael for his spot.  I don't think we can afford to have an entire wing negated when one player is injured.

Thinking about it, sometimes wingers are used to add width and stretch the opposition.  This is exactly what rafael does every single game.  If the team had only rafaels defensive errors to deal with we would be champions league contenders.   Its kind of how Barcelona had to compensate for dani alves attacking play.

1490~~~
His twin would probably be injured too. 


What's happening with Fabio these days anyway?

1491~~~
Surely that says more about the state of our defenders' health, than it does about Rafael?

Just like the rest of them, you can rely on him to be hand in a sick note regularly throughout the season. I don't see why that would suddenly change, and we really need to bring in a new right back who's good enough to be first choice. We're giving ourselves a handicap by placing too much trust in players who can't stay fit.

1492~~~
I saw he as out before the game and knew we would be in trouble. 

Every time he gets injured I die a little on the inside. My life just isn't the same.

But seriously he is such an influential player for us. He usually gets among the most touches in a game and really drives the team forward from deep. Valencia and most fullbacks in the league can't do that.

1493~~~
I didn't know injuries are supposed to be entertaining <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1494~~~
I've been saying this for a while, we needed (and still need) to sign a new right back. Someone who isn't injury prone and can be relied upon. Even when he's fit, he's still an inconsistent player who is capable of making an error or rash judgment anytime. There's no doubting his talent, and I feel that outside of us United fans, he has become quite underrated because of his reputation. But the truth is that even when he's fit, he hasn't been that consistent outside of one season. When you combine that with his constant injury issues, I just don't think it's worth it. We should definitely invest in a RB this summer. I had hoped that Varela would eventually provide competition for the spot, but that idea quickly faded away.

1495~~~
Please name me one player in the world who is incapable of making an error or a rash judgement...

1496~~~
Varela is class. I predicted that he'd take Rafael's spot if only given the chance. I don't know what the fvck United do with players sometimes. Loaned him off to Madrid when we signed Di Maria.

1497~~~
Surely you know what he means, Rafael makes them more often than the average player.

1498~~~
That's up for debate now, it's just when he does, he gets labelled as so because of his history. These days, while still prone to the rashness, he is quite reliable (when fit).

1499~~~
So when's he  back then?

1500~~~
Just get Seamus Coleman and a RB cover and lets sort RB once and for all. Rafael can join his crocked brother at Cardiff.

1501~~~
I get the impression you aren't a Rafael fan...

1502~~~
Rating a player is pretty pointless if he's never available. We need defenders on the pitch and not in the treatment room.

1503~~~
Then let's also get rid of Jones, Evans, Smalling, Falcao, Herrera etc...

1504~~~
If he was any good he wouldn't be playing in the Spanish second division at the age of almost 22.

1505~~~
Herrera has just picked 1 injury in his United's career, jury is still regarding Falcao, the rest, well, I would lose any sleep if we get rid of them. Let them warm someone else's treatment room instead of ours.

1506~~~
To be fair whilst the statement is over the top for getting rid of Rafael his injuries are a big problem in the progression of his career. 2 of the players you mention have been at the club 4 months so it's unfair to bracket them with our other injury prone players.

It's not his fault he's injured but at the same time it's hugely annoying that it always seems to happen. More frustrating is that we never seem to want to address issues like this at the time. We have no other natural right back at the club, Valencia should be a stop gap, Smalling isn't good enough on the ball to play there in our system and Jones is injured or not really suited to it either. 

I'd probably agree with others that the club most get annoyed with it and will possibly be looking at replacing or at least signing some top class competition for him to compete with.

1507~~~
I am not blaming him either. However the last time I checked, Manchester United was a football team and not an Intensive Therapy Unit. We need players who are constantly on the pitch and not in the treatment room.

1508~~~
I do agree we need to sign another RB and some CBs but I would take a long hard look at our fitness team because it's strange to have so many defenders all constantly get injured.

1509~~~
If Chelsea can have Luis and Azpilicueta competing for the same spot then there's no reason we can't have a top quality player competing with Rafael, particularly given his injury issues.

Rafael isn't so good that we should be signing someone just to be his back up either, it should be someone who can properly compete with and/or overtake him.

1510~~~
Since it's always the same players i would suspect that they are the problem.

1511~~~
These players have been under three managers, two of which were/are simply world class. Its evident that the issue is not the fitness team but the players

1512~~~
Ive watched him in the reserves a fair bit, looks decent but nothing exceptional, at least from the several games i've seen, its a bit harder to jude a position like fullback in the reserves so perhaps i'm wrong but he didn't leap out as a definite front runner for the first team like a few others have in the past few years.

1513~~~
He's fantastic, if he stays injury free he's one of the first names on the team sheet. We are a much poorer attacking team without him IMO.

1514~~~
But this is the problem, He can't stay fit. I'm a big fan of the guy and I think we look so much better with him in the team but abit like the other crocks, When do you say enough is enough? I think certainly we need to buy another RB, Even if just as cover.

1515~~~
The thing that annoys me most is that he's probably our third biggest attacking threat when he plays. (Behind di Maria and Rooney, usually). It's so clear to see the difference in our play when he isn't playing, especially in home games when we need stretch teams as much as we can.

1516~~~
Well that's the gamble you take with young players. They are far more likely to be injured and far more likely to make mistakes, however they are also far more likely to improve massively and eventually become key to winning trophies (than their equivalent 28 year old signing). The problem isn't having Rafael, Smalling & Jones in the squad. All are potentially great player's that have a decent chance of having careers like Vidic and Evra. The problem is a combination of bad luck and that we are trying to integrate too many younger, injury prone players all in similar positions all at once. I think everyone would agree that if Evans had become the defender we all thought we would be (ie not injury prone and very good) 3 years ago we wouldn't have this problem. Evans would be our main defender and one of Smalling, Jones or Rojo would partner him. 

The problem is that Evans is nearly 27 and has arguably gotten worse in the last 4 years, certainly in terms of his injuries. I think he is the one that needs replacing most, with an experienced defender with a track record coming in. You have to bear in mind though if you don't want injury prone, error prone player's we may as well shut down the academy and lower our expectations, as buying a £30-50m player in every position isn't a particularly viable business model.

I personally haven't given up on Jones, Smalling & Rafael; as they have all shown enough talent for us to be as patient as possible. That said we obviously need cover, as if we want to have say 8 first team defenders in the squad (Rojo, Shaw, Jones, Evans, Smalling, Rafael, Blackett, McNair) we can't have 4 that are injury prone.

1517~~~
Exactly! He is vital to our team, much more so than our CMs actually. He is like Evra in that he is a catalyst for our attacks from behind and links up terrifically well down that right side. Brilliant player, but unfortunately he suffers from too many injuries.

I do sometimes wonder if LVG should bring back Fabio at times though; proper cover for both fullback positions and enough talent to give competition for both.

1518~~~
Rafael is 24 years old. At his age Rio Ferdinand became the catalyst of our defense. Jaap Stam was just one year older when he did the same thing and he had zero experience in playing in a top league. By age 24 Rafael predecessor had been a first teamer for three full years and I am carefully avoiding the child prodigies here, defenders such as Maldini and Baresi who all debuted at age 16-17 and never looked back.

I am not expecting Jones, Smalling and Rafael to become the new Stam and Rio, although that's the level they have to reach to become United first team defenders. What I am expecting is that they are available. At this age their body is fully grown and they should have developed enough maturity not to go gung-ho in challenges and injure themselves. . If they can't then, I am sorry but they should feck off.

And where have I mentioned money in it? What I saying is that we need a group of defenders that are dependable irrespective if they come from the youth academy or anywhere else. Time and time again the club had shown great ability in developing and bringing good quality defenders at reasonable prices. If you we really want to put it in financial terms then what the point of keeping 3-4 defenders on top salary when they are never available when we need them? We might as well give them the boot and bring some reliable ones.

1519~~~
Fabio doesn't really have enough talent to give competition for both though, he's a very ordinary player compared to Rafael and Shaw, neither of whom are exactly world class themselves atm. We really need better than that.

1520~~~
At the age of 24 Vidic and Evra were at Spartak Moscow and Monaco respectively and it wouldn't be until 2-3 years later that they truly realised their potential. At 23-24 Jaap Stam was just starting to break into a poor PSV side in the Dutch League (and had injuries at United later on). Even Rio Ferdinand at 23 missed 8 months of Football for being a moron and missing a drugs test, which is far worse than any rash tackle Rafael, Jones or Smalling have made.

The overall point I'm making is it is pretty much a fact that defenders are in their peak between 26 and 30. Now as a club we have 3 options: Put up with the stupid red cards, injuries and lapses of judgement that occurs with young player's (particularly defenders) and hope they come good; buy all our defenders at the age of around 26-27 when they're over this problem (either as a proven top class player costing £30m and £100k a week or a hopeful Squillaci style punt who may prove useless); or a mixture of the two, trying to bed in young player's with potential along with proven player's in their peak.

Obviously the latter option is most preferable, which isn't a million miles away from where we are at the moment. As I said if Evans had stayed fit and continued his form of 3 years ago we'd be looking at a solid back 4. You swap say Hummels for Evans and buy a solid right back as backup/competition and our defence looks good. Hell Van Gaal may think that with some positional training Valencia can be this player, in which case we're basically 1 top defender away.

1521~~~
But he's a similar player that can attack and defend like a fb should much better than any of our current options. He's doing well at Cardiff right now and is a fan's favorite. He had a crap sending off before leaving United because he was so frozen out by Moyes that it made him overly eager to impress.

1522~~~
Seriously? Vidic was a rock at Spartak and his national side. He was courted by the likes of United, Juventus and Fiorentina. Jaap Stam was a year away from becoming the world most expensive defender. Evra had been courted by the top clubs for 1-2 years. All of them were available for their clubs and dependable for more then 10 games at a row something Jones, Rafael and Evans hasn't been for quite some time.

Its time we get rid of the red tinted glasses and make some decisions. These players may be the combination of Maldini, Blanc, Rio and Baresi (which they are certainly not, in fact they are nowhere near to world class defenders) but unless they are available then its pretty pointless to keep them. Now considering that we can expand the squad to an unlimited size due to logistics and financial restrictions then its time to make some painful decisions. We cant go on relying on kids and wingers while fantasising on how magnificent Rafael would have been against City, how frightened would Aguero have been if he faced Jones and his face expressions and how distracted would Toure have been whenever Helen Evans cheered her husband up. 

BTW as said before, a player is young at 17-19. At 23-24 he's heading towards his peak. I can make a long list of defenders who were simply great at that age. Our defenders can hardly stay fit for 2 games at a row.

1523~~~
He'd started like nine Premier League games in his time here (six years).
I'd hardly say Moyes froze him out.

1524~~~
that's because he hasn't yet reached his peak. Once he's 26 years of age his injuries will vanish and he will become the new Maldini. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/><img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1525~~~
Vidic was courted by United, Juventus and Fiorentina. Smalling was courted by United, Arsenal and others. Jones was courted by United, Liverpool and others. The only real difference is that Stam/Vidic/Evra had 2-3 extra years of making all their mistakes and getting over niggles in a crappy League, before moving to us.

The painful decisions you refer to I've outlined above. We either piss £150m on 5-6 quality defenders (4 central defenders, backup LB and a RB), skimp on the price and potentially end up with a few Squillaci's which are just deadwood or make some sensible changes. The sensible changes are to keep the player's who have shown enough to suggest we shouldn't write them off (Rafael, Jones, Smalling), move the player's on who haven't fulfilled their potential (possibly Evans) and add a player or 2 in their place.

Unless you have some certain strategy to bin Smalling, Evans, Rafael & Jones and replace them with 4 top quality player's who won't be injured, won't be a massive risk/hopeful punt and won't cost our entire budget for the next 18 months? In a World where Coleman would cost us £25-30m I'd love to here this strategy if you have one.

1526~~~
Oh come on. Just compare how many games he played while under Fergie compared to Moyes. He saw fewer minutes than Rafael because Evra was a guaranteed starter on the left and also because of injuries. When healthy he saw plenty of time on the pitch under Fergie.

1527~~~
Nine starts in six years. Sir Alex then bought Buttner.
He was on his way out whether Moyes came or not.

1528~~~
Buttner was bought as a makeshift lb after Fabio was loaned. He wasn't bought to replace Fabio. Fabio was loaned out to get more games because Evra was a guaranteed starter in the same way Carrick was whenever healthy. Rafael didn't have an Evra ahead of him so a loan was important. That's how it was viewed at the time of the loan.

He saw a lot more minutes under Fergie (even with injury plagued years) than under Moyes, starts or not.

1529~~~
Some players just need to be given a chance. We have Virmijl who can also provide decent cover but he's rotting in the reserves at 22. McNair and Blackett didn't push their way into the senior team necessarily because they were good enough, we had a crisis and they stepped up. Who's to say Varela and even Thorpe wouldn't have done the same?

1530~~~
Both McNair and Blackett were not front runners for anything first team before this season. Matter of fact, if not for our injury crisis most people would've probably not heard about McNair this season. His thread only had three posts all from 2012, before his call up to the team. Varela had hardcore youth team observers debating his prospects.

1531~~~
Jury is still out on McNair and Blackett. Nobody is saying that either of them is a long-term solution for us in central defence.

You're confusing being good enough to help us out in a crisis with being good enough to take the place of a player who has long established himself as talented enough to play at the very highest level. Massive difference between these two things.

1532~~~
No im not. To begin with, I think Varela should've been promoted as  back up to Rafael, rotation basis and injury cover (we all know Rafael can't go on a sustained run of games without injury). On top of that, I made the bold prediction that he'd keep Rafael off the team. Its not out of the question, but we probably won't ever get to find out. At the end of the day we need a reliable backup RB to provide stiff competition in that role. We only have Valencia who is not a RB. Some people think Rafael is untouchable.

1533~~~
What is actually wrong with him? Will he be available for Palace?

1534~~~
He's like the Alfa Romeo of RB's, the purist heart loves his flair and passion but you are always wondering when the next part will fall off.

1535~~~
I got it from an unconfirmed source that he's back training already and that the injury was just a knock picked up in training. We'll find out soon enough.

1536~~~
We certainly need a new RB, Rafael averages being fit for like half the matches and Valencia/Smalling/whoever just aren't good enough. Coleman would obviously be the dream but Clyne is good and I don't watch Italian football (who does?) but I've heard good things about Darmian and De Sciglio so they could be good shouts. The latter 3 can all play both sides too.

1537~~~
This would appear to be a rather important detail in all of this hullabaloo, and one which, so far as i am aware, some either view as irrelevant or have already determined the outcome of. Let's say that Rafael returns for the Palace match and this has been a minor albeit inconvenient absence, well that is an occurrence that will affect most players at one time or another. 

If people's concerns stem from his ability that is one thing, yet if on the other hand the focus is his availability or alleged lack thereof, then this season should be used to determine whether 2012/13 represented a sign of things to come or an anomaly. 

Depending on how far we progress in the FA Cup and taking into account the several matches for which he was unavailable earlier on in the PL season, what appearances target would be acceptable [assuming an early return from this current knock]? 

A range between the late-20s and early-30s is certainly achievable if Fergie's last campaign can be replicated.

1538~~~
Van Gaal didn't mention his injury in his presser before the City game no? So it couldn't have been that serious, they probably thought he might be able to make it for Sunday.

1539~~~
It doesn't really matter how many games Rafael plays, we still need to sign another RB to replace Valencia as cover for Rafael at least. In that case what's the point in just signing another limited player who will never challenge Rafael? It's not like he's so good that he couldn't do with competition anyway.

Sign another quality RB regardless. If Rafael struggles with fitness we're covered, if he doesn't then he can fight it out for his place. Either way, we're happy.

1540~~~
So is he playing this weekend? 

Our right sided attack is garbage without him. Here we say garbage, not rubbish.

1541~~~
Valencia did great against Chelsea under the circumstances

1542~~~
That was my thinking too. Would be fantastic if he's back.

1543~~~
I'd say average. How many crosses dud he get in? Did he beat his man at all? Any nice link up with other forwards? Not really. Rafael is twice the RB  Valencia is and helps Valencia greatly when they play together

1544~~~
He was better than average defensively and overall....couldn't ask much from him attack wise when we were a man down for most of the match.

1545~~~
He was good 1v1 but the other aspects of his defensive play were awful. Hard to blame him given he's not a RB.

Going forward I don't expect anything from him, so he never dissappoints.

1546~~~
That is how I approach it too.

1547~~~

1550~~~
Absolutely brilliant news. We could actually have a proper defence for Arsenal now.

1551~~~
Forget defense - might actually have a potent attack down the right. It's so strange that Valencia was one of the most feared wingers and one would think him playing as RB would give us that extra thrust down the right but, it's been quite the opposite. Now if only he can stay fit for the next 2-3 months and help us get a good streak going.-

1552~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1553~~~
Excellent news! We've really missed him, especially in attack, he adds so much down the right.

1554~~~
Wouldn't be too happy yet. He still has 2 weeks to injure himself.

He could dislocate a shoulder while trying to break a wishbone for example.

1555~~~
needs to get a haircut before he topples over and breaks something

1556~~~
Was it ever explained why he didn't play against Crystal Palace? What precisely was this "knock" that precluded him from training for more than a fortnight.

1557~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That was my first thought as well.

1558~~~
The same "knock" that has him posting on Instagram as soon as he is sufficiently recovered to start training again i.e. clearly a legitimate one.

Apparently picked it up in the warm up before a game, so more likely to be a pulled muscle than any kind of impact injury.

1559~~~
Really wonder why more players take up Yoga if they are susceptible to muscle injuries. Maybe Giggsy is a one off - ok not maybe he is a one off but, yoga did him wonders. Rafael's injuries tend to mostly be muscle related, surely with all the money we spend we can find a regime that will prevent them from being so frequent.

1560~~~
Not to worry, our state of the art facilities have him covered over the international break.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://postimg.org/image/6mihtphtd/full/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://s24.postimg.org/u0qh5mzqt/Carbon.jpg" src="http://s24.postimg.org/u0qh5mzqt/Carbon.jpg"/></a>

1561~~~
Thankfully just a niggle then. Good news.

1562~~~
It's kind of good news he is nowhere near the Brazil squad.

1563~~~
Think I read somewhere that he is still in doubt for Arsenal. Although if he is training now you would think he'd be a good chance of playing.

1564~~~
He'll be good for the next 3-4 games before his next injury.

1565~~~
Good he's back and all, but it is genuinely a matter of time before he's sidelined again. We already know this.

1566~~~
Yay, we'll have a right back for the next game. Always helps.

1567~~~
This. 

And for as long as we have that horrendous back line I don't want him anywhere near it.

1568~~~
Excellent. Internationals can be a blessing.

1569~~~
Ya it is good he isn't playing for Brazil now. But players as good as him really should. He is more than good enough to play for Brazil.  I don't buy the whole Olympics thing. Everyone knows that's not a proper tournament. I think there is other politics at play there. Brazil needs a big shakeup. If Rafael stays injury free they would be stupid not to pick him.

1570~~~
It's a joke with him (Of course with Jones too) <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1571~~~
He's a joke, should be sent to the glue factory at this stage.

In all seriousness though, I'd keep him as backup right-back, but we need to bring in a new first-choice.

1572~~~
What is Rafael's injury? He seemed to pick it up suddenly just before...the City match? Maybe? and has missed like 2 or 3 weeks since then now.

1573~~~
Such a shame.

1574~~~
According to Physioroom.com, Rafael has a groin/pelvis injury, and he's out till 8 December. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1575~~~
Huh? Didn't he post on his instagram that he is back in training? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1576~~~
We need some real replacements, this has to stop, and we're fecked vs Arsenal too.

1577~~~
Enough is enough.

1578~~~
Exactly. What Physioroom put up was probably in response to what van Gaal said about Rafael not being immediately available, but then again, I'm being hopeful here. It could actually be that Rafael can only train and isn't yet 100% match fit, which explains why van Gaal's stated that he's not available against Arsenal.

1579~~~
They are swimming up the same creek. I don't see how we are fecked.

1580~~~
First Fabio leaves and now more injuries to Rafael. I hurt. I hurt.

1581~~~
If only he had an identical twin with the same skill-set.

1582~~~
Calm down, he's probably not match fit. He'll play a reserve game and will be good to go

1583~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px">If only we had bought absolutely any half-decent RB in the world who could stay fit. There are League One RBs who would probably be more useful than always having to put Valencia or a CB at RB position to "do a job". It's unbelievable that this situation has gone on for multiple seasons now. What other "top club" would be so stupid?</span>

1584~~~
And then get injured again. 

I love Rafa but it's time we got in a RB who can remain fit for more than a few games at a time.

1585~~~
We should have bought that Yedlin fella...

1586~~~
LVG likes players to train for minimum of a week before he will consider them for a match

1587~~~
Rafael is one of my favourite United players but we really do need a new first choice RB.

1588~~~
He would probably be injured too.

1589~~~
That is part of his philosophy... Eating breakfast, I suppose, is also part of his philosophy, I would imagine, as is driving a car if the distance is more than two miles.

1590~~~
Or a very capable back-up. Which is what I would prefer. Although Valencia has been decent in his last few matches so we will see.

1591~~~
If I was bored I would dig up the posts from those who went ballistic on here at the mere suggestion that United would buy an alternative RB to Rafael.

1592~~~
City have Kolarov and Clichy, Zabaleta and Sagna. We can make it work too.

Fullbacks are so important to the modern game now, they play arguably the most athletically challenging position these days. We definitely need a decent rotation option to give them each a break.

1593~~~
I was ravaged recently when I suggested that Clyne should be signed and played ahead of Rafae. Mind you that was before he played for England and I'm guessing that many on here wouldn't have known how good Clyne was before that

1594~~~
Like Jones, like Smalling, like Evans, Rafael is frustrating me. Frustrating because we all know how good this guy can be. We can put so much confidence in him, to be the RB for the decade to come, but he’s always injured, or always doing a mistake. It seems that he was at his peak with two monsters (add VDS) next to him, and even Valencia protecting him.

In fact, is he so good? Being protected by Ferdinand and Valencia it should be easier for him. But I’m fed up with him. We can’t rely on him anymore. We should and we must fix our RB issue once for all, as we must fix our CB issues as soon as possible. If fit and in a regular defense, he can proves to be one of the best, but he’s dependent on too many factors now.

Would you keep a player (that’s the point with our other injury prone clowns) if you can’t rely on him, if he gives you only half games of the season (including 50% of jokes like Leicester) and the rest he gives you injuries, yellow card and especially injuries ?

LVG axed Welbeck because he wasn’t United standard. That’s the same for Clevinho, Chicha…. But is Rafael really United standard? I’m not convinced because of what he gives us at the end of the season and the fact that he’s so disappointing in that aspect.

1595~~~
I suggested to buy a starter this summer and i received some indignation, but to be fair i also said that a RB was more important than a CB, i was a little bit wrong, we needed both.

1596~~~
Don't worry Rafa, you're still my boy. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

1597~~~
It still smarts we let his understudy go off to Real's B-team, given his injury record and (IMHO) Valencia's not always convincing defensive ability. 

I guess that is also a good gig for a young lad, though...

1598~~~
We need to sign a RB. I understand people saying Rafael is too good to be back-up or there's no point spending big money on a RB to be back-up, but there wouldn't be a first choice/back-up given Rafael's injury record.

Rafael can start if fit, and when not, the back-up can come in therefore they will most likely both play around 20-25+ games, it will be ideal if the back-up could also play LB as we only have Shaw for that position with Rojo (a CB) who can cover there.

1599~~~
Rafael is clearly United standard. Cannot believe people question his ability. I get his injuries are frustrating and <i>IF </i>we were to sell him it would be because of that, cannot be a lack of talent.

1600~~~
Feel sorry for brilliant players like Rafael who keep getting injured without it being their fault. Frustrating for both parties but still my favorite United player though <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1601~~~
Naah, they still have Welbz,Walcott, Sanchez, Ox, Wilshere, Ramsey, Arteta, Flamini, Chambers, Per, Wojiech available, their key players missing are Ozil, Debuchy, Kos, you can hardly call Ozil one.United possibly without Jones, Evans, Rafa, Shaw, Blind, Carrick..

1602~~~
What's the benefit in buying a back up rather than a new first choice though?

If we just buy a good back up then we're still depending on Rafael stepping up if we want a top class RB. On the other hand, if we buy a RB who is good enough to displace Rafael anyway then we can't lose. Either Rafael gets fit and steps up (in which case we're delighted with our strength in that position) or he doesn't (in which case we're not heavily effected)

Chelsea were happy to bring in top class competition for Azpilucueta even after he had an excellent season so why would we be reluctant to do the same?

1603~~~
I agree with this. We need to bring someone good enough to be a starter. Survival of the fittest literally.

1604~~~
We still have De Gea, Herrera, Di Maria, Mata, Januzaj, Van Persie, Rooney etc, hardly lacking in quality. 

Don't know how much Arsenal you have seen this season but we should be excited about Arteta and Flamini playing and especially Chambers at RB.

1605~~~
All those players you've named are attacking players, it's the defensive players that we miss and by that the balance in total, without Blind the balance is back to old on its own, but with the absence of Rafa, Shaw possibly, Jones, Evans it not even there.

1606~~~
He's been surprisingly poor so far, which seems to have gone under a lot of people's radars. Definitely something to exploit there, given that we've been strong attacking down that flank with Di Maria and Shaw.

1607~~~
No doubt but the only player that you mentioned from Arsenal that concerns me is Sanchez. Absolutely nothing to worry about with the likes of Wilshere, Ramsay (who has been awful), Arteta and Flamimi etc. Always love watching Mertesacker try to football as well.

1608~~~
In Arsenal's perspective, which player of us has looked like being capable of doing something? Di Maria completely out of form and Rooney has been on a good run for England but also nothing special, they have a player who has won them matches recently, singlehandedly, can't say that of the United side.

1609~~~
So you have no faith in any United player producing any type of quality that will hurt Arsenal?

1610~~~
I think they can, but they havent done it recently, I dont think apart from Shaw and de Gea we have any player really in form.

1611~~~
That has nothing to do with a player turning it on this week. Players are out of form before they hit form and players are in form before the hit a form slump. Come kick off, who cares what happened last week or in previous games, anything can happen and I back our quality over theirs.

1612~~~
I dont think its likely that players who have been underperforming for weeks/months are suddenly going to do Arsenal some serious damage.

1613~~~
Welcome to football, it takes a second to change things. One slip, one bounce of the ball, one referee decision, it can change everything in a second.

1614~~~
Where would we even find a top class RB though? It'd be a risk to spend big on one who might not make it. I'd just prefer a capable back-up because when Rafael is fit I think he is one of the best in the league.

1615~~~
Out of curiosity, what is the longest run of matches Rafael has ever played for us?   I'm thinking six, max.

1616~~~
He pulled at least ten in a row during SAF's last year.

1617~~~
has there been some kind of a setback in his recovery?
when he had gotten injured, it was just a niggle. physioroom had him as a "doubt" for today's match. Now, physioroom has him coming back on the 8th of december. This means missing today and two more games.
The same can be said about jones. 
I know LvG said that these two will not be available for selection today, but has there been update based on which physioroom changed it's information?

1618~~~
Probably just common sense from Physioroom. They know that he plays for us, so it's only reasonable to keep adding a few weeks to his injury every time his return date approaches.

1619~~~
Even 10 is relatively poor, all things considered.

1620~~~
Good player, but not great by a long shot.  United need to buy a top quality RB and let Rafael play second fiddle to him.  His injuries are so frustrating and when he plays, my heart is always in my mouth as he looks like he is just going to foul or do something stupid.  Massively overrated on here.

1621~~~
You need to learn to be more pessimistic, chances are you'll have a better Saturday night if you understand that before kick off.....I for example could watch the match in my living room. But because of my nervous disposition I will sit in the kitchen and gauge how we are doing purely by being on the forum. Thats the kinda shit I'm talking about!

1622~~~
What top quality right backs are available better than Rafael? We need to get someone solid and reliable in though that's for sure as Rafael is plagued by these injuries. We should aim to get a good proper full back in asap, then if Rafael is fit, great we have options, if not then at least we'd have someone better than Valencia or an out of position Jones back there.

1623~~~
Coleman Coleman and that player Coleman.

1624~~~
Is he available though? I reckon he'd cost an absolute fortune if they were even willing to part with him. Has he got long left on his contract? I should have said available for a reasonable price, because I'd rather we spunked the big bucks on central defence.

1625~~~
They could well be interested in Nani which could help......

1626~~~
He posts about starting training and then doesn't feature in weeks.


Happened twice now. Odd.

1627~~~
Probably injured himself afterwards.

1628~~~
you are right with his injuries and that is that, on the other hand you are horribly wrong that he is overrated here. He is not he deserves all the credit given. He is always top 3 player on the pitch even he plays after a long break due to injury problems. Fouling is part of the game of every defender. Not every player is Rio Ferdinand. Anyway I think we should have a look at some RB, his injuries are so frustrating

1629~~~
That's the case <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> .....i give up with him. Pay 30m for Coleman in January.

1630~~~
Hope to see him back for the Southampton game, we miss his quality down the right side overlapping.

1631~~~
If he's training today he should be 100% starting at the weekend but mostly likely not Tuesday which is fine.  Our attacking diamond as seen yesterday could've done damage to even the best of teams and all we're missing is width via Shaw and Rafael, I can't wait until they're back, we're gonna be quality!

1632~~~
I thought Valencia being subbed off yesterday was to give him a bit of a break so I don't imagine Rafa will be back on Tuesday. 

Can't wait for his return though. He's so important to the way we play.

1633~~~
Agreed. I think the aim will be the Southampton game or maybe even Liverpool.

1634~~~
Coleman was ball watching for Spurs second goal. He was alright, but clearly a level below Rafael in today's match. If he had the same level of scrutiny like Rafael does, he would be criticized more. 30 Million for Coleman, you are having a fecking laugh.

1635~~~
His positioning, like Baines', leaves a lot to be desired and like Baines' will be exposed at a higher level yet people will swear blind he's better than Rafa. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

I just think back to Micah Richards' interview yesterday when he was saying, at the time he was being hailed as the best full back in England, he always knew his positioning was bad and he used his pace and power to get out of jail lots. The media settle on narratives, like Coleman being anywhere near as good as someone like Zabaleta, and after that only an unmitigated failure changes their tune e.g. Baines at Brazil 2014.

1636~~~
Yup, as I and a few have mentioned on here before - Everton are seen as a 'neutral' side, and because of this they aren't ever really scrutinised much. Nobody really cares enough to do it. It's far easier to focus on their pro's through highlights and the odd game. I mean, Coleman is a great attacking fullback but defensively he isn't as good as Rafael. The brainfarts of 'Manchester United fullback' are going to be hot news and remain in the mind far longer, allowing lazy narratives to appear factual.

1637~~~
Coleman or someone else.......Rafael as future RB is a big feckin laugh

1638~~~
Only because of his injury record. His quality is more than enough to be our RB for years if he could just escape the injuries.

1639~~~
That reason is big enough. If he would be the only injury-prone player in the squad then it's maybe a different situation. But we have far too many of them and some of them must go.

1640~~~
I love Rafael to bits and think he's worth keeping for the games he can play as I don't think its potential anymore. He's just a top class right back. 

That being said, if he can only play 6 in 10 matches, does that not make him 40% less effective than he should be?

I think Valencia is going a good job deputising though and Van Gaal would do well in PR terms to say that he considers Valencia a full/wingback now and will be working on his game accordingly. 

There would then be a lot less fraustrated vitriolic opinion in his direction than when we were a team relying on wing play and he was absolutely terrible going forward.

1641~~~
Rafael's injury record is why a new right back who can go straight into the team is the number 1 priority, in my opinion, in the transfer market.

1642~~~
I really hope he can play the Southampton and Pool game at his 100%

1643~~~
Definitely.  Going forward we have to think about cover for Shaw also though.

1644~~~
Oh, I agree 100%, if he can't become more reliable fitness-wise then we need someone else of equal quality. I just don't like it when people use his absence as an excuse to start underrating his actual ability (which I don't think Sean was doing, but plenty in the Caf do.)

1645~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://instagram.com/orafa2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">orafa2</a>
2 days ago
Very good match well done boys . Back training normal tomorrow ready to help. Very happy <a class="externalLink" href="http://instagram.com/manchesterunited" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@manchesterunited</a>

1646~~~
Will he get the same treatment as Saha in the end? Or will van Gaal be more patient with him given his quality?

There are lots of good attacking full backs coming up, but few of them are actually good enough defensively. Given this, should we tolerate Rafael's injury-proneness as he's one of the few defensively good full backs, or should we weaken our right side, defensively, whilst getting a more constant figure there?

For me, I'd rather keep a defensively solid full back than not. Besides, it's not as if Rafael's as injury-prone as Saha or Hargreaves.

1647~~~
I think that we should stick with him this year and see what happens. If he continues getting injured, then in the summer, we should probably go for Coleman. Rafael is my favorite player, but if he isn't fit for half of the matches, then we should probably look for someone else.

1648~~~
I'm wondering if the way Rafa has worded that tweet means anything, he says back to <i>training normal</i>, so maybe that means he's been back in training (which he mentioned a couple of weeks ago iirc) but that was to build his fitness up, and now he's back with the first team.

It would fit in with the way LVG seems to like it done. I.e two weeks of training after an injury before being ready for selection.

1649~~~
He has few fantastic qualities in his game and to be honest i can see him stay for a long time at Old Trafford* (even if one day Barca or Real Madrid would be interested in him)

His character is also perfect for a United player. Dirty bastard...we don't have many of them in the squad and he gives always 100%.

But i'm far from happy with his head......the Leicester penalty situation or his stupid early yellow card against Chelsea.....he must really improve that

*I really rate Rafael and love him but like said many times it's now the time that he stays fit in the next months or he'll have no chance to be our starting RB next season

1650~~~
As he also seems to like bringing players back to fitness via the U21's, I wonder if his exclusion from tonight's game means anything. However Falcao skipped that step, so perhaps it's only used for players who've had longer absences like Evans.

1651~~~
I'd really like to see Varela given a chance to show his stuff in the English prem next season.  As a point of interest, Varela was included in Real's CL squad for 14/15, so one has to conclude he has some ability.

1652~~~
shame injuries kept on disturbing him. he is class.

kind of agree we need a good back up. i'll take a phil neville kind of a player now. someone who is a good option at RB and LB. valencia has been doing well as a back up although van gaal might have second thoughts about starting him there against the big sides.

1653~~~
If only he had a twin or something.

1654~~~
I find it incredible that people are still blaming him for the Leicester penalty! Its beggars belief! He's fouled, then DOESNT commit a foul and that's his fault, explain to me in what world that makes any sense. If you are judging him on things he hasn't done then I can't see why you want him out.

1655~~~
I want to punch people in the back of the head and kick them in the pancreas any time they suggest that was Rafael's fault.

1656~~~
Imagine the abuse Rafael would have received if he didn't get up and attempt to close down the diver form Leicester.

1657~~~
Being injured is hardly a choice. I'm sure he'd love to stay fit.

1658~~~
Isn't that the one LvG said Rafael could do better on?

1659~~~
We just need another young prospect surely rather than a full on replacement.
Its incredible that for 3 seasons now we've not had a young backup to Rafael who could use these injuries to gain experience

1660~~~
He could've done slightly better from a defensive point of view, but it doesn't justify the award of a penalty...because it wasn't a penalty.

1661~~~
Stupid decision to let him go IMO.

1662~~~
Yes of course he was fouled by the Leicester player (Vardy???) in the corner.....but as soon there was no foul given, he was back on his feet and runs back in the box to attack the Leicester player again......i could see Leicester will get a penalty......foul or no foul by Rafael.......Clattenburg thought he wants revenge

Of course it was actually Clattenburg's fault.....i just wanna say it wasn't a clever move by Rafael.....we had enough bodies in the box to stop the Leicester player

1663~~~
And if Rafael stays on the ground he gets shot down on for not getting on with it. Sorry but he can't win in that situation. Clattenburg was awful, end of.

1664~~~
What would've been the preferable action? Not to challenge him at all? Then he'd be berated for giving up. He didn't go in aggressively, he didn't even put a foot out, he did quite literally nothing wrong and yet still gets blamed for it?

1665~~~
I'm genuinely at a loss as to how this is still a conversation that people are having.

Rafael's only mistake was expecting Clattenburg to possess eyes, a brain and functional optic nerves.

1666~~~
Any news on when he might possibly be back?

We need to fish for a new first choice right back in the market really.

1667~~~
Absolutely. There are no sensible reasons to think he will suddenly stop getting injured.

1668~~~
If that was Rafael's only mistake then why did LvG say he should have done better?

He was obviously fouled beforehand and the ref was poor but it still wasn't good defending on Rafael's part, in the same way it isn't good defending when a player clumsily throws their leg out for an attacker to deliberately fall over.

1669~~~
Not one excuse has come out of van Gaal's mouth all season, he's never going to blame the referee there. I don't think it was transcendental defending but I don't think that he did anything wrong or that he made any kind of mistake, in the same way that the WBA guy that Ramires flung himself into last season didn't do anything wrong or make a mistake. Either way I have already exhausted my interest in this topic. At the end of the day it was two clear mistakes from Clattenburg and I think most can agree on that.

Very sad, very true.

1670~~~
Exactly, I don't understand people views on this situation, what was Rafa supposed to do? It wasn't like the ball was going out off play or Vardy was cornered with no passing options. Vardy was free, in the box with options for a pass, Rafa did the right thing, he closed down his man and put pressure on him, what's wrong with that?
The only thing wrong is Vardy going down like a sack of potatoes and clatternburg calling a clanger

1671~~~
I'd like to continue with Valencia at right-back for now, he's played well there. And God knows when Rafael actually returns from injury.

1672~~~
Amazing, isn't it?

1673~~~
Or probably buy a first choice RB this January or this summer. 

We're all tired with Rafa's injuries and dips in form. I think that it's really time to settle a back four and since we can't rely on him too much we should go for a solid RB

1674~~~
No doubt.

It's time to admit that he'll never lose his injury proneness and that '12-13 was the exception.

1675~~~
We'll be having these same conversations this time next year, no doubt.
Unless we sign a new right back.

1676~~~
We all love him when he’s playing well but too inconsistent. He can have a wonderful game like against Chelsea and his very good job on Hazard, but being so poor like a WBA a week later.

Do you think that Coleman is the right solution? Or maybe Clyne ?

1677~~~
Has someone followed Danilo? Always seemed like a proper prospect.

1678~~~
Got torn apart by world-class Stoke City winger Marko Arnautovic when Brazil played Austria last month.

Clyne or Coleman are the best shouts at the moment, should Rafa not make it.

1679~~~
If we do dip into the market for a RB, I hope it's for a defensively solid one. Improve their attack, but being able to defend inline with the "philosophy" would be priority, for me. 
Attacking fullbacks are great, but I'd want one equally good at both, and attacking is easier to get better at.

1680~~~
Aah, but I'm not surprised by that, Arnautovic is the most unpredictable player in the world imo, he can be very poor at times, but when he has his matches, he's unstoppable. In terms of pure ability, he was by far the best in Eredivisie I remember.

1681~~~
Yeah, I know Arnautovic. Wasn't really a serious post, I'm not judging a player on one performance in an international friendly. I just literally didn't see any other match of Danilo in the last 2 years. Maybe <a class="username" data-user="74350, @Sly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/74350/">@Sly</a> knows more.

1682~~~
I'm happy with valencia as a backup for now. no need for a rb in jan imo.

1683~~~
I think we should just break the bank for Coleman at the earliest opportunity.

Rafael can then compete for the RB choice when fit, and also cover at LB where we are pretty thin on the ground.

I love Rafael but unfortunately it has reached a point where he just cannot be relied upon, fitness wise.

1684~~~
These days attacking is as important as defending. We can always play there Jones who is defensively solid.. As long as we stick to this diamond paly we should be aspring to have world class Fullbacks capable to attack providing the width we lack for the most of the time when Valencia is playing. Young was very good last match but his delivery is unfortunately very poor. both him and Tony looked quite solid defensively, Young being solid defensively is a huge surprise for me, not long time ago he played off striker role next to Welbeck right now he is proper fullback and he has done good so far.. I wouldn't go to market only to buy world class quality or at least possibly someone solid who can cover both flanks - ie Nathan Clyne. I would buy Azpilacueta but he would cost so much..

1685~~~
Danilo is finally beggining to prove his worth and his hefty price tag. He has been considerably worse than Alex Sandro in the last two years but this year under Lopetegui he is playing very well and has been one of the key players for Porto (with some important goals and assists, which is nice for a right back). Dunga has also been calling him to the Brazilian national team since he got appointed. At Porto he always plays as right back but he can also play as CM with reasonable efficiency. He got torn appart by Arnautovic? I didn't watch that match but any player can have a bad performance. He has held his own well against better players than Arnautovic.

1686~~~
And it was the one play that NBC chose to insert into one of their adverts.  Irks me every time I see Clattenburg pointing...

1687~~~
Thanks.

Yep, torn apart is the right term, at least in the first 45 minutes it was the case.

1688~~~
Over 160 appearances for United and only 24 - fantastic player - but after all we should get rid of best players shouldn't we<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1689~~~
Get rid ? I think that no one wants that.

But we need a first choice RB, we can't play a seconded rated player half of the season. Rafael is injury prone, we can't trust him to be fit for an entire season.

1690~~~
He has been in the squad since lets say 18, so he has been here 6 years, that matches a bit more than 25 matches per year, maybe that's the reason. Even Valencia has matched 200 matches for United. And he has been here later. In only one season he has played more than 25 league games, that's the reason why we should sell him/give him a smaller role, he is injury prone, error prone (which costs us points at times).

1691~~~
Hardly anybody here thinks we should get rid of Rafael, that possibility is barely ever mentioned.

People just want us to have an alternative given how reliant we currently are on an injury prone player.

There's also no point in signing someone who isn't good enough to compete with or displace Rafael. He isn't so brilliant that he couldn't do with competition, even when fit.

1692~~~
No need for wasting £20-25 million on Coleman. We had a capable alternate to Rafael up until fairly recently. And could probably resign him for £5 million given his team's current status.

1693~~~
Fabio is injury prone too, and he is not very good.

1694~~~
He wasn't first choice when he was 18 - Neville was still here till 2010 - he played 40 times in 2012/13 and even 28 last season with some injuries - he's missed some games this season - but if we want to replace all the players who have injuries we will be replacing 90% of the team. He will become one of the best full backs in the world, don't think he's that far now

1695~~~
Fabio isn't good enough.

1696~~~
Man, hope he doesn't suffer another injury this season. Desperate for him to succeed here cause we know how good he is.

1697~~~
He's been largely injury free for the past year. And it's not as if we're going to need him for 30 games per season. Even if Rafael's out for 20 games annually it shouldn't be a problem considering Fabio played an average of 21 games per season from 2010/ 2011 to 2012/ 2013. Also disagree on the second part. We don't need a world-class addition at right back. If we do buy that caliber of a player then might as well get rid of Rafael because he's too good of a player to be an understudy to the new arrival.

Fabio while not earth-shattering is a good little player whose growth as a footballer was hampered by Patrice Evra's consistent presence at left-back and his brother's emergence on the opposite flank. He would be a decent backup with option to start in Rafael's absence, wouldn't cost much, gives a 100 % every time he puts on the shirt, knows the club inside out and has chemistry with a lot of the players. If anyone can help resurrect his career, it's Van Gaal after the dismal treatment at our previous manager's hands.

We don't need a swing backup of absolute top quality.

1698~~~
1) If he would be good then he wouldn't be now a Championship player (He was only very good for a weeks in a United shirt)

2) I think he even had more injuries than Rafael

3) Wasting 20-25m on Coleman <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1699~~~
I hope something is done in the transfer window for a second RB because with Rafael out, there just ain't anything happening on the right side.  It's like having one arm.

1700~~~
It'd be wiser to get a fullback capable of covering both flanks, akin to Azpilicueta for Chelsea. The likes of Vrsaljko, Darmian, possibly even De Sciglio. A player who will not cost a major amount and be content in being less than a first team player but more than just a squad player.

1701~~~
??

1. I don't think it's as black and white as that. Fabio's deal was largely situational, forced by the previous manager and facilitated by the presence of a United great at the then Premier League club Cardiff City. And before one looks down upon Championship based players - Baines was playing in the championship at about age 23, as was Coleman at age 22, Cahill at age 23, and Jagielka at age 25. Fabio was a good player for United, the sustained, evergreen presence of Evra just didn't give him the opportunity to claim a starting role in his natural position as opposed to Rafael who got the chance with Gary Neville's injury concerns and subsequent retirement.

2. We wouldn't be bringing him to usurp Rafael as the starter. Just as a backup who could start in his stead for 15-20 and provide some security blanket. Also as stated before he has been relatively healthy for the past calender year.

3. What's so funny about it ? People slam Rafael's supposed rash ways and mental lapses, but Coleman makes some rather unforced errors that go largely unnoticed because of the fact that he's playing at Everton. At United every such fault will be relentlessly scrutinized. That aside from the fact that he's not a £20-25 million player by any stretch of the imagination when a right-back of fairly equivalent quality transferred to Arsenal for £10million (Debuchy). I'd suspect we could sign Van der Wiel for a similar £10 million fee if PSG make Auerier's deal permanent. And he is every bit as good of a fullback as Coleman apart from the temporary cockfight with Van Gaal.

1702~~~
Ashley Young probably could do that, if his future here is as a full back now. He's barely got a left foot as it is, but Van Gaal seems to fancy him as a left sided player right now.

1703~~~
Is Rafael much better though?  I don't remember there being much difference between them

1704~~~
Rafael is probably my favourite player, but we're 14 games into the season and he's made it out onto the pitch 6 times. That isn't enough, and we need a viable alternative that can perform just as well. I don't think Valencia is a long term resolution and it's a position we need to look at over the next two transfer windows. 

Keep Rafael by all means, but we can't rely on him the way we do right now.

1705~~~
Domestically (top four-ish), I think that would be enough. But for our future aspirations; winning the league and competing in Europe we need more.

1706~~~
I'd agree, specifically in the Champions League. I think he is a decent quad player to have in the Premier League, even when we're looking to be gunning down the title.

I'm really not a fan of the guy, but I've been impressed with his stand-in left back performances. Given he can play on both sides in defence and midfield/wing, he's a good versatile squad option overall if he can continue to put in solid performances like he has been doing.

1707~~~
Where's the white text bro?

1708~~~
On the topic of Fabio, I saw this on a Cardiff forum:

United has a club except to play at least 56 games per seasons (38 in PL, 8 in the domestic cups and 10 in CL). Rafael can't do that every seasons, so we have to answer to this question who do we want to play when Rafael is erratically absent ? Because he can be absent for a CL QF or a cup final.
I prefer to see either a very talented young fullback or a very experienced one, and not a makeshift fullback or an average player without future.

1710~~~
Why? Effectively we only have one real RB and he's always on the sickbed or coming off it. Keep Valencia as a backup and sign a real RB in January. One that can play game in game out.

1711~~~
People keep saying Rafael will become the best RB in the world. Lets be realistic here, he's 24 years old now and he's basically the same player he's been for the last 4 years. He's hopes of representing Brazil are slim to none. How is he going to achieve this with all these injuries?

1712~~~
What? He's been one of the best RBs in the league last season and this one, grant it only when he's not injured.

1713~~~
He's always been a good player, from day one. However, we can't pretend that he has taken his game to a new level because he hasn't. Im talking about being in contention for bigger individual accolades and recognition beyond just United fans and England

1714~~~
I only remember one decent run of games that Fabio had at right back, his best position. And I didn't think he was any worse than Rafael. Sorry.

1715~~~
Hey, don't be sorry. Name 3 right backs that are better than Rafael in the premier league.

1716~~~
Ivanovic
Azplicueta
Clyne
Coleman

1717~~~
Its unreal how many United fans don't rate Rafael. I've even seen people saying Valencia is better at right back. Laughable stuff.

1718~~~
You could add Sagna and Zabaleta to that list also.

1719~~~
Zabaleta obviously, and arguably Debuchy.

1720~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1721~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> WUM

1722~~~
Christ, adding Sagna and Debuchy to the debate reeks of desperation.

1723~~~
You can laugh it off, but Zabaleta is clearly better, I think it's even biased to think he isnt, Debuchy is arguably, Rafael at his best is better by a good margin, but Debuchy is reliable and continuous, Rafa will be the best outfield player this weak, the next one he'll get a red card or give away a penalty, always injured and hasnt had a decent run since SAF.

1724~~~
Debuchy who's right now not playing for Arsenal? He's got one yellow card all season you WUM.

1725~~~
Honestly on last season form Johnson and Flanagan are better.

1726~~~
Maybe this is just me suffering from Hargreaves syndrome but I genuinely believe that if he played regularly this season then he'd widely be considered the best right back in the league by the end of it. He improves our attacking so much when he's fit and on form.

1727~~~
On one leg he won't play much.

You are both wuming Zabaleta, Azpilicueta and Ivanovic are better. And Rafael is as good as Clyne and Coleman but not clearly better.

1728~~~
feck off with your sensible posts here Shamu, we'll talk Flanagan anyday over Rafael.

1729~~~
I am talking about players over a longer period, you know Debuchy played for Newcastle in the past huh? We all know Rafa is error prone.

1730~~~
What's the last error your remember?

1731~~~
He is not error prone per say, but he is not a great marker.

1732~~~
Probably Leicester, maybe not fully deserved but it's utter stupidity to give the ref such a chance to give a pen.

1733~~~
The gif is right there on the top of this page. There's like a 0.00001 chance of being ruled a pen, which means there should be no challenge in the box because there's always a chance that some cnut will dive. Again, I'm calling you a WUM.

1734~~~
He fecked up against WBA dropping behind the line and making Berahino onside but feck me it is real extremes in here. Either he is the best RB out there or he is worse than Sagna and Debuchy. He is better than the 2 of them but he isn't the best.

1735~~~
Liverpool last season then.. It's just stupid to go into a challenge like that and especially with the referee's angle, he can give a pen even if it isnt, just rash thinking. Just like Baines' pen wasnt a pen, but Shaw gave the referee the opportunity to give one as it's just extremely risky and hard to see. Ask the majority of the opposition fans, who is better Rafa or Debuchy and I doubt it would be overly clear Rafa is seen as the better player, Rafa his best is brilliant, if he is at his best he is in the top of the league, but in the overall, Debuchy isn't really really far from him, underrated guy imo.

1736~~~
There's a reason why Debuchy's "underrated". He's very poor defensively, but he's great going forward. He's an unreliable right back who's going to be the weak spot of any good team's defence. Chambers at right back has been better than Debuchy, and I'm baffled that Wenger didn't go for Aurier instead of Debuchy, even if Aurier's naive as a young player.

I'm honestly surprised that people view Rafael as being worse than Sagna, Debuchy, Coleman, and Clyne. To see <a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a> mention that Rafael's a poor man marker made me think back to his last appearance, against Chelsea, where he almost completely marked out Hazard, which reminded me of countless more appearances where he marked out top class players (his former teammate and right-wing partner C. Ronaldo included).

It's pretty obvious that Rafael's being underrated due to his injuries. His very few appearances on the pitch make his bad moments more memorable than the good ones. I guess they'll realise Rafael's value once he leaves and we get someone who's not as good, defensively, as he is whilst offering the same attacking threat if not better.

Currently, Azpi and Zabaleta have performed better than Rafael. Ivanovic has been on par with him, with Chambers just, just below him and very close to being on par with Rafael, whilst Clyne and Coleman haven't shown the defensive solidity that Rafael does. Debuchy, though...<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1737~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1738~~~
A lot of us rate him, but more and more of us are realising that it's hard to put your faith in someone who always injured. same old story for the last few seasons.

1739~~~
A very fair point regarding injuries. I'd be definitely ok with buying a reliable back up/good competition for Rafael if he can only play for about half of our games.

1740~~~
There is no chance Chambers has been better than Clyne and Coleman and hasn't been close to Rafael either. He has been absolutely destroyed a few times and has clearly looked like a CB being played out wide.

1741~~~
As would I, but it's unfair on the team to have to rely on a player who is always injured. The same can be said for our centrebacks, but I'm willing to give them a little more time(specifically Smalling and Rojo). Jones I'm wary of, Evans can't stay fit etc.

1742~~~
The only time I remember him being rinsed was when he played against Montero. He showed lots of naivety in that match. Other than that, though, he has been a great right back for Arsenal. He's been very good defensively and decent going forward with an excellent cross in him. I just hope Wenger keeps him there and replace him with Debuchy.

1743~~~
Ah what with his 2 PL red cards in his whole, 6 year, United career so far. And this is exactly what I mean, there is this stigma attached to Rafael that he's rash and likely to get sent off/concede a penalty and no matter what he does, people will just keep coming back to it. I reckon it all stems from that Red card vs Bayern all those years ago.

For the record, Zabaleta has more red cards then Rafael in the same period of time. But no one would call his rash or a red card waiting to happen.

Nothing wrong with having issues/concerns over his fitness, I do too. I have no problem with that.

Its the people that bring up the same old cliches about his being rash, poor defensively etc etc that annoys me.

1744~~~
It's a tough call to make to be fair. Jones is equally injury prone, if not more.

1745~~~
We should probably ignore him. Debuchy FFS

1746~~~
This reminds me of the Rooney thread - let's replace our best players
and replace all of those who are injured - goodbye to Shaw, Blind, Falcao, Di Maria, Rojo, Jones etc etc etc etc
Must be a WUM

1747~~~
I said not great , i never said that he was poor and i never said that he was worse than Sagna or Debuchy.
I quite clearly said that he wasn't a great marker and that Coleman or Clyne were as good.
Rafael is probably the best RB offensively but defensively Azpilicueta, Ivanovic and Zabaleta are a lot better.

1748~~~
So, he's stupid for not committing a foul and doing something no right-minded ref should ever penalise? Damn, that's some logic, right there.

1749~~~
Only Zabaleta and Ivanovic have claims to being better than Rafael.

1750~~~
It's not who's currently injured, but rather who's continously injured.  Rafael for instance had 28 appearances in all competions last season, and 40 the year before, 18 before that, and  28 before that. That doesn't mean he's injured, but it's been a common caf talking point the past few years simply because he's known to be injured. I'm willing to stand by him, but is his injury record going to improve? I doubt it.

1751~~~
Dude, Ribery...

1752~~~
Fair post, Ivanovic is a beast. 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Bloody Germans, errr. French

1753~~~
Let's sign Debuchy then , cos he's not injured<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1754~~~
He is injured

1755~~~
Knowing our luck whoever we buy will get injured anyway tbf.

See Shaw, Rojo, Herrera already this season.

Rafael's injuries are a big issue but i think it would be ideal to buy someone who can cover both flanks really. Shaw doesn't have a backup right now either and Young is even lesser Fullback than Valencia.

1756~~~
Ivanovic is overrated frankly. He is suited to Chelsea's structure but the greatest at one on ones or going forward.

Zabaleta maybe but he has dropped off recently too. Agree on Azpi but he's playing LB these days.

And Coleman is definitely better than Clyne. Clyne's defensive game and positioning is pretty average.


I think the best 3 for me would be Coleman, Rafael, Zabaleta. (Azpi being a LB). Put them in whatever order.

1757~~~
But that's not bad for a young player - I think he is brilliant - but you could probably say the same for most of the squad regarding injuries. Sometimes he was not selected but not always because he was injured.
Quite happy with him and Valencia(who has learnt a lot under LvG) as back-up

1758~~~
It's a bit odd that he's not been mentioned in injury updates. He is fit and available for selection, right?

1759~~~
About Ivanovic only, It's a matter of opinion, yours is wrong but i can't judge.
For the rest i agree.

1760~~~
fit for Soton

1761~~~
He came back in training as per insta couple of weeks ago. Then assume picked up another knock and now is back in training again.

Depends if LVG wants to wait 2 weeks again.

1762~~~
Last season Rafael started 18 PL games. He commited 19 fouls.
In the same season Zabaleta started 34 PL games and commited 53 fouls.

The season before that Rafael started 27 PL games and commited 36 fouls.
Zabaleta started 29 games and commited 45 fouls.

But Rafael is the rash one. The one that can't defend and the one likely to get sent off.

Edit: I should probably point out that I'm not digging at Zabaleta here, I think he's fantastic. Just trying to debunk the usual nonsense that is spouted about Rafa.

1763~~~
Note the sarcasm

1764~~~
What I meant was it's odd that we're getting updates via Insta, rather than coming out of the club. He's kind of the forgotten man.

Which is a little strange, as he's quite an important player IMO. Nobody would have expected Valencia to perform so well in his absence.

1765~~~
Man! just fart a little, you are tense. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1766~~~
Journos have a terrible habit of only asking about the 'big name' injuries at the pressers.

Its incredibly frustrating as we always seem to be in the dark when one of the 'lesser' names get injured for any period of time.

1767~~~
I'd agree with this.

1768~~~
Totally with you - but you forgot all the yellow and red cards that Zabeleta has accumulated in excess of Rafael - and having to take the blame for blind referees, by the way what happened to Clattenburg - probably back for the Liverpool game to give them 3 more penalties this season

1769~~~
I'm really not surprised by those stats. I'm not sure why people seem so intent in downplaying how good Rafael is. He's definitely one of the very best in the league.

1770~~~
I know that you said that he wasn't a great marker, but the fact that he's done very in marking top class players makes him better at marking than you think (for me, at least).

Also, in terms of your claim, I don't think they are that much better. Slightly, perhaps, but not "much". Comparing Coleman and Clyne's marking to Rafael's, I wouldn't say they are even. Both rely lots on their pace to recover themselves and stop opponents. Rafael used to be like that in the beginning, but he's now better than Clyne and Coleman at keeping track of the dribbler and maintaining his ground and stance. His marking is comparable to that of the top 3 that you mentioned.

It's fine that you think he isn't a great marker, but I disagree with that notion.

1771~~~
Je pete un plomb<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1772~~~
The rash part is only due to the Munich game, some people can't past over it, and now he is seen as rash and apparently stupid.

1773~~~
Yep, when he was 19

1774~~~
I find it strange that a few think Ivanovic is overrated. As a central defender, sure, but as a right back, dirty tricks aside, he's one of.the best right backs in the league if not the best so far.

1775~~~
I'm simply fed up with the injuries, he's just not reliable enough for us.

1776~~~
Rafael is not a great marker, what makes him a great player is that while most of the time he is good defensively, he is one of the best offensively.

The combination of his offensive and defensive abilities makes him great for us. But when i judge two fullbacks the most important things are the defensive attributes and Rafael have a lot to work before being the equal of Ivanovic, Azpilicueta or Zabaleta.

Now it wasn't the initial discussion, the real problem with Rafael isn't about his level, but about his durability and the department he is the worst. And some of us think that we should have a better player to play with when Rafael is injured.

Personally, i don't want to get rid of him or consider him as a back up, i want two starters. Like Marcelo and Coentrao or Felipe Luis and Azpi.

1777~~~
I know that that wasn't the initial discussion, but I'd like to know what Rafael is missing that is making him a great defender nowadays.

Also, I very much agree with the notion that we need a right back of good quality to be a part of this squad alongside Rafael rather than a mere backup player like Valencia or Young. Rafael's injuries, whilst not at the same level as Saha's or Hargreaves', is still worrisome for a club that wants to play at the top level. However, I am struggling to think of right backs who are available for this role in the squad and is defensively decent. Maybe Aurier?

1778~~~
Always injured eh?
2012/2013 Only RVP De Gea & Carrick started more PL games
2013/2014 started same number of PL games as RVP

1779~~~
What a strange argument.

It's widely accepted that the 2012/13 season was Rafael's best, mainly because of his lack of injuries.
It's also widely accepted that van Persie had a fairly shite 2013/14 season, and that injuries played their part.

There's no denying that Rafael is an injury prone player anyway.

1780~~~
Great defender ? 
It's very subjective but I would say consistency, if was like he was against Hazard all the time, he would be a great defender.
Nowadays the fullbacks who are great defenders are rare there is only Ivanovic, Zabaleta, Lahm, Alaba, Arbeloa and Carvajal.

1781~~~
His 2012/13 season was his best season because he was a competent defender too. He just didn't become the league's best defender just by being fit for most of the matches.

1782~~~
Yeah, there's multiple reasons he enjoyed the 2012/13 season, but the lack of injuries was the major factor.

1783~~~
And by comparison


The alarming part is the number of injuries to his thighs, that's ridiculous.

1784~~~
I don't know, It was not 'the' major factor. Him being a competent defender, equally adept at attacking, keeping Bale at the height of Bale mania in his pockets was the major factor. I think we are pretty close to be honest, we both are saying he's a stand out player if he can be fit and his best season was when he was was injured, because if he's fit, he's class anyway.

1785~~~
Rafael and Fabio always had big potential, the injuries stunted their development somewhat. 2012/13 allowed Rafael to develop into a fine young right-back, but the injuries remain unfortunately.

1786~~~
And RVP isn't, just for an example?

1787~~~
Sorry, what? Rafael is not potential material, he's the first choice RB for a club like Manchester United. Unless you are saying players like Coleman are just players with potential.

1788~~~
What? I said the lack of injuries throughout the 2012/13 season allowed Rafael to fulfill his potential.

1789~~~
van Persie is quite an injury prone player, yeah. As is Falcao. As is Smalling. As is Jones. As is Evans. None of 'em are all that dependable, are they?

1790~~~
[The alarming part is the number of injuries to his thighs, that's ridiculous.[/QUOTE]

But look at Chelsea's defence injury wise - they have a had a settled defence with very few injuries for some time, the problem lies elsewhere

1791~~~
I remember watching a match on BT Sport last season and Michael Owen said that Rafael is prone to cramps and that is why he gets injured so often. Wonder how true that is.

1792~~~
Exactly, there are a lot of players who are regularly injured, not just Rafael - look at Chelsea, very few injuries - what is the reason? this is the key

1793~~~
The reason is that they are injury prone players.

1794~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1795~~~
So he managed to rack up nearly 80 appearances because he had potential? Not seeing it tbh, he was the first choice defender going in to the 12/13 season.

1796~~~
There has to be more to it than that - we happen to have a squad of injured players and Chelsea happen to have a squad of players that are rarely injured - and it's not just recently

1797~~~
Of course he was, I'm not sure what you're trying to argue here? There is no doubting Rafael had potential up until the 2012/13 season, a potential he was finally able to fulfill with a full season with little to no injuries.

1798~~~
Likely true I'd say, especially as Michael Owen played here and I doubt he just pulled the cramps thing out of his ass.

1799~~~
I think that the club isn't careful enough when it comes to stay away from crippled players, and sentimentality other clubs get rid of the players who can't play, we give them new contracts.
But in Rafael's case, i understand the "gamble".

1800~~~
He said he knew it from his time at the club. They probably spent a lot of time together in the medical center.

1801~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1802~~~
I meant to say "that can make him", not "that is" so that's my mistake.

In response to your response, I fail to recall the last time Rafael was truly troubled by someone in 1-on-1 situations. He's very good at stopping players from troubling him.

Are you referring to Rafael's Vardy incident and Berahino's goal as signs that he is an inconsistent defender?

P.S.: I wouldn't put Carvajal up there, yet. He's still prone to errors here and there, but he is becoming much more consistent, and he is starting to become much tougher to beat.

1803~~~
In the Vardy incident, he should have been better before the incident, in general Rafael is good defensively in the big games and average in the others.

I tend to use Ashley Cole as reference and he was ruthless all the time, honestly i don't know what Rafael lacks because he really showed everything but it's not always there. To rich the next level, he will need to be ruthless defensively, all the time.

Now, I think about leicester's goal in the first half, he is not at fault, but by precaution he needs to anticipate and place himself between the ball and the striker, not behind him.

1804~~~
Are you Efan Ekoku? This is the view he would have taken lol. Speaking of which, I do miss him in commentaries...

Anyways, I see how you view defenders, and I used to view them like that as well. However, I then realised that I stopped giving credit to the attacking players for their goals.

If you want to view defenders like that, go ahead, but if you're going to criticise Rafael for Ulloa's first goal, then I will say that no one else can really deal with that except for a bigger, stronger full back like Ivanovic or Alaba.

1805~~~
Is this based on the fact that he declared that he started training a couple of days back or has someone actually confirmed that he is fit for Southampton?
With both him and Rooney back in the side, I am beginning to like our chances in the match at St Mary's.

1806~~~
Physioroom.com says that Rafael will be fit to play by that time, so unless he gets a freak injury in training, expect him to start ahead of Valencia on the right.

1807~~~
Dont want to look like a squawka whore, but just using some stats as the Rafa love can never be broken. But saying Rafa is much better defensively, out of these facts isnt really legit. I know there's more to it, but if Rafa would be so much better defensively, I think the differences would be bigger. <img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B4BddbxIAAAisp2.png" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B4BddbxIAAAisp2.png"/><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B4BddbsIIAAyrDw.png" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B4BddbsIIAAyrDw.png"/> Rafa his best is top of the world, but just like Nani he hasnt really showed it over longer periods, only time he really did that was 2012/2013..

1808~~~
Did you seriously printscreen your entire desktop to get those pictures? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1809~~~
Yes, before the Caf I have never made a screenshot on the pc, don't know how to do it the other way x_x.

1810~~~
Why does this idea that physioroom have inside information on players fitness persist?  They just set dates based on the new reports when the injury happened.

1811~~~
Regularly fit - not another RB I'd take out there. But, I am getting to the point where a lot have long reached - which is if he can't play consistently due to injury issues then get someone else in that can. I like someone's logic earlier in the thread, if Rafael is 100% the best but, is only available half the games and our back up is good for giving us 70% of what Rafa gives us - then in the long run it's better to just get someone who may be 90% of what Rafael gives us when fit but at least they'd be doing that consistently and not to mention the effect of having a settled backline.

1812~~~
Snipping tool is your friend.

1813~~~
It really is frustrating the way we have injury concerns over ever fecking defender in our squad. I used to expect fullbacks to be more or less bullet-proof, with the likes of Denis Irwin chugging up and down the sideline week after week after week. Sheasy was almost as impervious to damage, then Paddy Evra turned out to be his heir apparent. Just did not get injured, no matter how many tackles he flew into or how many times he was kicked. 

More recently the likes of City and Chelsea seem to have also nailed down indestructible fullbacks in Zabaleta and Ivanovic. Up and down the league table you see club after club picking the same fullback every single weekend. So bloody annoying that this seems to be completely beyond us.

1814~~~
We need to buy a reliable fullback. Rafael is anything but reliable unfortunately.

1815~~~
None of our defenders can be classed as reliable.

1816~~~
The same Squawka that gives Zabaleta a defensive score of -2.2? It's better to look at more stats and watch their actual performances than just look at the scores. I did this both in Squawka and WhoScored (I analysed Rafael, Debuchy, Coleman, Clyne, and Zabaleta), and both have confirmed the notion that I had all along: Rafael's defensive abilities and performances are up there with the best.

Debuchy, Clyne, and Zabaleta all have more tackles attempted per 90 minutes than Rafael. These players have also conceded more fouls per 90 minutes than Rafael. Rafael, however, has the most interceptions per 90 minutes as well as the most blocks per 90 minutes. He also has the second-most clearances per 90 minutes, with Debuchy having the most. These stats tell me what I have always seen with Debuchy, Clyne, and Zabaleta: these full backs defend very aggressively. Zabaleta's the only one out of those three who tries to mark the opposition whilst the other two defend more like wingers in that they get right at the face of the opponents and try to win the ball very quickly. It also helps that Debuchy and Clyne have the pace to recover themselves and make a tackle to stop the opposing ball carrier from making things worse. This aggressive defensive style is what makes them look like better defenders when they actually aren't. Debuchy and Clyne have shown a poor sense of awareness around them, and both have been poor at marking their man when they aren't able to press at the opposing ball holder (see Clyne vs. Ox yesterday and every single Debuchy appearance). Coleman has also shown this bad defensive awareness and below-average marking ability even though he isn't as aggressive as Clyne, Debuchy, and Zabaleta.

Also, after comparing Rafael and Debuchy with Chambers, Ivanovic, and Azpilicueta, I've reached the same conclusion. Chambers, being a more natural full back than Debuchy, is much better defensively than he is. Same goes for Ivanovic and Azpilicueta.

Tackles shouldn't be the be-all and end-all to how good a full back is. If you play too aggressively, you can easily get caught out of position, and you can easily be beaten by good dribblers. Rafael may not have had the most tackles, but he's been better, defensively, than Debuchy, Coleman, Clyne, and even Zabaleta this season.

1817~~~
I know that they don't have inside information, but their predictions have been spot on lots of times. Not only this, but ManUtd.com used to use Physioroom.com as the source for injury reports on their website, and I see why they used to.

At least this is better than the fake reports that come out from journalists.

1818~~~
We only have two senior fullbacks, Rafael and Shaw. We have 6 CBs. Three of them are injury prone, 2 are young and not ready. We also have Thorpe and Michael Keane. We need a RB

1819~~~
Rafael's injury woes would explain the links with Clyne today.

1820~~~
I thought he said he was back training now?

1821~~~
He's a brilliant right back. dont want a new right back replacement.

1822~~~
Hugs

1823~~~
Except for when he always gets injured and we have to play Valencia at RB.

1824~~~
Feck man, he just needs to get fit. He plays for the shirt every time he's out there.

1825~~~
Did you feel the same about Hargreaves in midfield?

1826~~~
Yes, his injury concerns are a worry 2 seasons out of 6 with under 20 appearances but I just think at 24 his talent and proven performances as shown in 2012/2013 warrant faith and a bit of patience with him. He was tied with zabaleta as the best right back in the league at 22. and he is more than capable of putting big runs of games together. he's one of the only players who go out and not only turn up in big games, but show actual grit and fight, he's a trooper. there are worse backup right backs to have than Valencia who has done very well and phil jones who can do a shift there defensively if push came to shove.

Getting a player of his quality in would cost us an absolute fortune and i just dont see the point, we could go out and grab Darmian? (is it? the italian lad) and he could struggle to adapt and get a few knocks as well. 

I see him as a potential captain after rooney.

1827~~~
No one is questioning his ability at RB. People are concerned that our first choice RB always seems to be injured and cannot be relied on to be fit a whole season. Valencia is an okay backup but it would be better to get an actual RB.

1828~~~
Agreed, we should get a good youngish rb who can legitimately challenge Rafael when he is fit. Besides if (more like when <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>) we qualify for CL, we'd need a proper cover and not a make shift winger who is suspect with his positioning and reading of the game.

No point in sticking with Valencia and Young, two makeshift 29 year olds who will be found out at the top level. They can do a job right now but we should be looking to upgrade asap. Fullbacks who can actually challenge for the first team spot and provide cover when Rafael or Shaw are injured. Full back position is arguably our weakest when it comes to depth.

1829~~~
I'm as big a Rafael fan as you can get but it's time to admit that his run of games a couple of years ago was the exception to the rule. He just cannot stay fit for an extended period and as a result we have to put ourselves through watching Valencia play.

A new RB is a must.

1830~~~
Alves will be his replacement and will give us 2 seasons. I'd rather we go for a younger player. I'd even take Coleman

1831~~~
City managed to get Sagna as full back cover and Chelsea got Luis so depending on Alves wages it could be a smart back up buy, of course starting Rafael as the first choice but not a bad player to have as back up, especially on a free.

1832~~~
Was he in the pictures for last weeks training?

1833~~~
Bloody hell. Fanboyism of the worst kind. Of course the club should be trying to get an alternative RB given Rafaels terrible injury record. Valencia is not a RB. If, miracle of miracles, Rafael stays fit and is clearly the better player then he'll still play. But him staying fit is not something the club can put all their faith in. 

We have multiple options in midfield, CB, and striker positions. Why the hell would the club not have cover at fullback?

1834~~~
Well... he's using Internet Explorer...

From today!

1836~~~
So saturday night is done. right?
the embargoed section should have been released right? this section has news on rafael's injury right?
do we know anything about this?

1837~~~
Do we not have any quality RB in our reserves? How has that Varela guy been  doing so far?

1838~~~
on loan at Real Madrid Castilla with option to buy.

1839~~~
WTF? Why on earth would we promote an overrated, injury prone, hot head Brazillian to captain? Based on what? And we laugh at RAWK!

1840~~~
Ouch.

1841~~~
Maybe the RAWK reference was a bit harsh! Still, I can't for one reason think why Rafael would make a decent captain though. He wouldn't even get in the side if we had a half decent RB at the club. My opinion though.

1842~~~
Your opinion is bonkers. Rafael is a fantastic right back with all the right attributes.

1843~~~
Come on then, give me some examples that make him a better option than others to be our captain?

1844~~~
Well firstly i think he's a great right back, who will be here long term so therefore we have a player who will be in the starting lineup whenever available. 

Secondly, He has the winning mentality and fight that was the trademark of the Ferguson era, having played with the likes of rio, vidic, giggs, scholes, van der sar etc he knows the deal.

He's someone who wont back down when the game gets fired up, who can put a tackle in on someone to get the fans riled up in a derby, or as a bit of payback for a teammate getting clattered earlier, the little things that impact the mentality of the squad in tense situations. He's got a bit of Keane about him.

the only question mark is his fitness right now, but at 24, he wouldn't hypothetically take over from Rooney for years, and who says he wont get over his injury niggles by then. its all guess work and opinions, i just think he's a leader.

1845~~~
I think he starts whenever available as there is no other decent option. I don't see him as a great RB. For that reason I couldn't see him in any captancy scenario - you need a leader to stand up on the pitch, stand out and make a difference. Rooney this season has been a good example of that. Rafael doesn't have the qualities as a player to be looked up at, as captain. Again, my opinion as I don't rate him much above a good player.

He may have winning mentality (I'd suspect most players who were around during SAF reign, would have such a mentality), but the fight you mention turns into rash decisions, charging into tackles (usually resulting in a card) and looking reckless. As a player, would you want to see your captain acting like this? Watching him when he is fired up is like waiting for a card to happen, so players must see this. There is no controlled aggression.

However, none of us will most likely ever know what happens behind closed doors, and you may be right, he may be a natural leader on the training ground and in the dressing room, but I haven't seen any example of it on the pitch.

1846~~~
Rafael completely changes the way we play, not many RB's have such an impact on their team, maybe Zabaleta does. But we are such a better team with Rafael, really proved that last season too. He makes a difference both in defence but especially in attack, he gives us so much more balance.

1847~~~
True he offers us something unique that just tranforms the whole team and his energy is infectious. Injuries aside he is perfect for us.

1848~~~
In the same way Evra used to on the other side, if only he was totally unbreakable, like Evra. 

Anyone know how many games Evra missed through injury during his whole time at United?

1849~~~
Not that I can particularly see Rafael ever becoming our captain but that sounds exactly like a description of a young Rooney.

1850~~~
He'll first play for the 2nd team before being ready then.

1851~~~
<b>"Rafael has already trained with us for one week. Also now he has to play in the second squad. I’m sorry for that but it is my philosophy and the players [should understand]. If they don’t I’m not interested.”</b>

I want him now though!!

1852~~~
I'd be more impressed with this hardline policy if it was resulting in less injuries. It isn't so far.

1853~~~
I'm sick of this philosophy talk already, especially in terms of injuries. We need Rafael back now. We don't have the option to ease him back in.

1854~~~
Ahhh damn, was hoping he'd be fit for tomorrow. Guess he'll defo be ready for Liverpool then.

1855~~~
Of course we do, and we will. Valencia has been doing a decent job and can easily continue doing so for another match.

1856~~~
I don't fancy Valencia there to be honest. He was awful last season whenever Moyes played him at RB. He has done better recently but to be fair other than the Arsenal game he hasn't had to be very good.

1857~~~
Its not an ideal role for him, but he has been quite good during one off occasions where he's been deputized as a RB over the years. Its best to bring Rafa back slowly so he doesn't risk re-aggravating his injury, at which point he will probably be done for the year.

1858~~~
Shite.

1859~~~
True but I'm so much more relaxed with Rafael there. At least I hope he is back for the Liverpool game.

1860~~~
It's preferable to bringing him back too early and having him hobble off after 15 minutes.

1861~~~
It's not like he is coming back from a long term injury though. He has been training for over a week and considering he was only out for a few weeks he should be fine.

1862~~~
I'm tempted to trust the manager on things like this.

1863~~~
As I understand it, LvG's preference is for a player to train at least two weeks before returning to the squad.  Guess that two weeks is a minimum-unless you're Rojo.  Maybe LvG's approach is different for muscle-related injuries versus Rojo's shoulder, because Rojo wasn't training for two weeks before gettimg into the line-up.

1864~~~
The next u21 match isn't until the same day as the Liverpool match so unless we have a BHC match setup for this week I guess he'll miss that too.

1865~~~
Did LvG really say that? Pretty sure majority of our players who returned from injuries didn't have to feature in the U/21s first.

1866~~~
I've got a funny feeling that Rafael is one of the ones LvG was refeering to when he said that his players need to harden up with regards to injuries and play though a bit of pain.

1867~~~
In all fairness Rojo had played every game this season so he was fit where as Rafael got injured on tour and missed not only the first few games but all the training prior to that. This is Rafael's second injury already this season.

1868~~~
Aye, I was about to say, Rojo had barely missed a game or a training session. He must have only missed a week or 2 with his shoulder. Doubt that affected his fitness much, as I'm sure he wasn't just sat on his arse during that time. He probably did something like cycling which doesn't use the upper body.

1869~~~
philosophy

1870~~~
I just think that the caution he takes when he brings injured players back into the squad is a bit OTT.

1871~~~
Rafael has struggled with injuries more than most, not just this season. Taking a little extra care with him seems pretty sensible to me.

1872~~~
Its such a shame with his injuries, probably the most passionate player on the pitch when hes fit, plus hes quality once he gets a run of games, we all know what hes capable of from SAF`s last season

Sadly since then hes been injury plagued non stop

1873~~~
True. I just feel if he has been training for over a week, and wasn't injured for that long in the first place, not playing him tomorrow night is a bit excessive.

1874~~~
Apparently it's a new protocol, LVG is tired of all the injuries and refuses to select the players who don't comeback at a very good level of fitness. So they train with the fitness coach and when he decides that they are ready they can be selected, if not they play for the reserve.

1875~~~
Feck we need to put <a class="username" data-user="4852, @ryan_forlan" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/4852/">@ryan_forlan</a> on suicide watch.

1876~~~
u-21 game it is now for rafa. no problem. hope he should be ready for liverpool.

but we still need a RB next summer. a priority alongside a top class CB and another CM imo. it is apparent rafa cannot stay fit all of the time and while he is a very good player when available, we have to cope when he is out. would not mind dani alves on a free transfer although his wage fee might be excessive for sure.

1877~~~
Forgot he existed. If he can stay fit thru the festive period, I'll be glad!

1878~~~
Silly thing for him to say. Someone already mentioned Rojo being out and not playing in the 2nd squad but, Falcao hasn't either. Not that he cares but, it definitely opens the thought that some are favorites. If he was consistent then it see no fault in the philosophy. 

At least hope he gets to play before Liverpool for the U21s - those dipper cnuts raise their game for us and at least Rafael bothers with doing the same.

1879~~~
Rojo had a shoulder injury and was able to keep fit without being in full contact training. He was only out for 3 weeks, had a full week of training before coming back into the fold. He was "match fot" which is what Van Gaal wants. 

Falcao if you read the full interview, he doesnt have the luxury of playing in the reserves. He wants to but with the way the games have come and Rooney being injured against Stoke he couldnt play him as he needed him on the bench. 

Therrs no double standards at all.

1880~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2010/11/10/1289424229513/Rafael-da-Silva-v-Carlos--006.jpg" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2010/11/10/1289424229513/Rafael-da-Silva-v-Carlos--006.jpg"/>

1881~~~
LvG just generally seemed a bit tetchy in the interview with questions about Koeman etc. All through his interview, I don't think he suggests he's irritated with any player, he just said the players have to accept playing in the reserves before getting a run out with the first team. I don't see the problem really, but hey ho..

1882~~~
As much as I miss Rafael, I'd rather he wasn't rushed back. Last thing we need is for him to be out again at all during the busy period coming up. Plus having Rafael and Di Maria back will be a boost for the Liverpool game.

1883~~~
I'm the same. I don't actually have an issue with players having to come back through the U/21s either I like the 'philosophy.'

1884~~~
Just saw that he did say he wanted Falcao to play 2nd team but, circumstance hasn't allowed. Rafael been out since Chelsea game an that really wasn't much longer than Rojo though. Nonetheless him outwardly saying even Falcao would have been playing 2nd team first is a good thing.

1885~~~
Rafael not the in 18? Damn. When will we see him in the team?

1886~~~
Rafael fanboys better start worrying...



<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/19/manchester-united-louis-van-gaal-sir-alex-ferguson?CMP=share_btn_tw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...s-van-gaal-sir-alex-ferguson?CMP=share_btn_tw</a>

1887~~~
If he's genuinely picking Valencia over him on merit then I guess a new RB signing is nailed on soon....

1888~~~
What? He didn't even make the bench vs Liverpool on merit? That doesn't make any sense at all <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1889~~~
Valencia over Rafa then, LVG? Hmmm.

1890~~~
McNair and Blackett were the defenders we had on the bench, right? Maybe he wanted CBs given we were playing three at the back.....

1891~~~
Valencia has been in really good form, though I'm not sure why Rafael wouldnt be in the squad at all.

1892~~~
maybe there was still some truth behind the rumours...

1893~~~
I guess you must be right, but if Valencia had got injured then Rafael would be the obvious sub. If one of the CBs got injured he could also have brought Rafael on and switched to 4 at the back, but presumably wanted to keep his 3 CBs. 

I can't get my head round why 2 CB subs is better than 1 CB and a full back, when we had no full backs on the bench...

1894~~~
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

1895~~~
Tbf our CBs are about five times more likely to get injured than Valencia.

1896~~~
Strange, Rafael is quite comfortably a better RB than Valencia.

1897~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://scontent-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10850272_834561479936386_8673917779399813189_n.jpg?oh=84de03d8cd801742d86762e6196b39e2&amp;oe=550C9317" src="https://scontent-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10850272_834561479936386_8673917779399813189_n.jpg?oh=84de03d8cd801742d86762e6196b39e2&amp;oe=550C9317"/> 

Seems pretty happy.

1898~~~
Fair point!

1899~~~
Even as a massive Rafael fan, I can see why LVG would stick with Valencia for now. He's been playing quite well recently, and we need to get as consistent a back 4(5) as we can for now. And with Rafa, you just know there is an injury around the corner.

1900~~~
Valencia has been excellent at right back recently. Van Gaal is absolutely right and it sends a great message to the squad.

1901~~~
He's in a hot tub with Mata and De Gea, of course he's happy!

1902~~~
If Rafael had his right leg amputated below the knee, I'd pick Valencia. Otherwise, no.

I had great hopes for him and his twin when they came first. If LVG prefers Valencia, he may eventually follow his bro out the door. Pity.

1903~~~
As much as I rate Rafael, and I think he's really good,  you just can't legislate for how many games he misses through injury. It's unfortunate but I just think he's going to be constantly injured.

I'd hope we're looking at a new right back in the Summer.

1904~~~
With Fellaini out injured, it's a good bet Valencia will reprise his right-sided position in midfield with Rafael returning at fullback.

1905~~~
I love Rafael too but I definately agree that Valencia should keep his place for now.He has been playing very well recently and deserves to stay in the team as long as he keeps the form up.

This has been something that has really pleased me so far this season.No player's place in the team is automatic and he doesn't rush back half fit players based ob reputation.It really demoralising for a player to play a good run of games and then immediatly lose his place when a player returns to training.

That said I am hoping to see Rafael at RB tomorrow with Valencia in midfield.

1906~~~
His English is a little poor....

1907~~~
You have a point of course. It would be hard on Valencia to be dumped after recent good performances.

1908~~~
I "mistakenly" put valencia over rafael for strongest 11 in another thread and was questioned about why. Valencia has been very very good at right back and right wing back this season and it seems LvG agrees with me. Valencia is in better form than him at the moment. A lot of fan boys will not be pleased with this <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1909~~~
Setting up a goal in a big game suddenly makes Valencia better than Raf?  Not sure I agree, in either role (RB or RWB)...

1910~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> cuz that's what people are saying right? 

"oh valencia played a ball through welsh Xavi legs and crossed a ball..he should play over rafael each game" 

Yup everyone is saying that and that's why Valencia is starting over Raf.

1911~~~
Yes, that is exactly what I said.

1912~~~
I could be wrong but I don't think that Rafael has played as a RWB for us other than briefly in the first US tour game where he got injured, so with us playing the 3-5-2 recently Valencia has staked a claim. The thing that makes no sense to me is not having him on the bench as he offers a lot more than Fletcher period, or Januzaj who'd be the only RWB option sitting there.

1913~~~
As good as Valencia and Young have been for us while Rafa and Shaw have been out injured, they've still made mistakes. We've just been lucky the teams haven't taken them and De Gea has been in super human mode.

Sooner or later it will bite us in the ass, so I wouldn't persist with keeping Rafa out.

1914~~~
At the moment i'd have to agree that Valencia deserves to keep his place but find it alarming that people think this is a sign that rafael will sooner rather than later be sold. Apart from that slightly unlucky moment with that awful ref decision at leicester the guy was looking great before injury struck again. Gotta say i have a real soft spot for rafael- i love the fact we have this quick, fearless little brazilian fullback that we plucked from obscurity. His delivery has become really good too. Proper united player in my eyes I mean he'll drive you mad at times but united in general will drive you mad at times.

1915~~~
What i find peculiar is that Blackett and mcnair both make the bench over Rafael!! That to me is the biggest eyebrow raiser.

1916~~~
Never mind summer. Lets get one in January

1917~~~
We have to understand one thing. Valencia has been playing as a RWB in the back 5 formation recently.
I genuinely believed that we were playing a back 5 as we did not have any full backs available, and he had to use Young and Valencia as full backs. That is how I was living with the crap formation and the crap performance that comes with this crap formation.
Now that LvG has said that Valencia started even though Rafael was available. I believe there can be two reasons for the crap formation:
1. He needs fit and in form first choice CBs to move in a normal back 4. He has not had that and hence he is sticking with a back 5.
2. He has decided he wants to stick with a back 5, as that is his preferred formation.
I really hope the former is the main reason. Nervous...

One more thing, Valencia can't be trusted as a RB in a back 4. I really hope Rafael comes back to the starting line-up soon. Sticking with him in my line-up prediction.

1918~~~
He's played just slightly less games in a flat four than he has as a RWB. There's no basis for you saying 'he can't be trusted' in a back four.

1919~~~
I think it's as simple as LvG just prefers Valencia to Rafael.

1920~~~
Yeah that does seem kind of odd. Having one CB on the bench is fine but to have two young ones while completely dropping Rafael does not seem to bode well.

1921~~~
You have to trust the manager to put the team out. If he feels Valencia gives him balance, then so be it.

1922~~~
Or the other reason being Valencia has been excellent and Rafael will need to wait and fight for his chance to get back in the team. Great news for all united fans as performance levels will only go up with competition for places.

1923~~~
We probably should buy a right back.

For the half the season Rafael will inevitably miss.

1924~~~
Valencia deserves his spot at the right back. Good to see the manager picking players on form/merit rather than anything else.

1925~~~
I have no issue with the form argument but I don't understand not even having him in the 18, if Valencia got hurt we have no RB cover and out only RWB is Januzaj, and Rafael is certainly better than him in that role.

1926~~~
What 18?

Only game he wasn't in the 18 for was Liverpool. And that may have been a match too soon for him.

1927~~~
LvG said he was left out on merit, we'll see if he's in the 18 tomorrow but it didn't sound like he would be.

1928~~~
Agree with the merit argument as well. So AV should stay, however I am concerned, while AV has been going forward and solid in the tackle his positioning and anticipation are suspect, same with Young, and those are things that come with playing the role for a long time.  

We've been lucky to not get punished for that, like when Valencia was caught behind Moreno's who's poor 1st touch prevented a clear 1 v 1 with DDG or when Young got caught underneath the cross that have Henderson a clear header at goal that with better execution should have resulted in a goal.

1929~~~
Of course he has been fit for long, but he's not getting picked, it's the same situation with Herrera [Fellaini, Mata], Falcao [RVP], yet, many wll ignore Rafa and keep banging on about how LVG doesn't rate or like Herrera/Falcao and stuff like that. If you're injured and your replacement has done well, the manager has to be fair and keep picking that fellow. Shaw will go through the same process if Young keeps on performing very well at LB, that's how LVG operates.

1930~~~
OK. Well in that case, I don't agree with LvG. Just like I don't agree with the back 5 etc. I am miffed :-(

1931~~~
Disagree with LVG but hopefully it works. I'm not convinced with Valencia defensively or going forward..

1932~~~
Shaw is still not fit so we cant go back to the back 4 unless he is fit too.

1933~~~
Agree with this.  Rafael is one of my favourite players and Valenica has done my nut in for a while now, but while Valencia is playing well and doing as the manager asks, he should play.

1934~~~
Spot on. Doing a good job as cover isn't the same as being capable of fulfilling that role full time. Maybe Rafael is playing badly in training or something.

1935~~~
Even Rojo or Blind would work.

1936~~~
Valencia having played in a back four when Rafael was injured does not necessarily mean that he can  be trusted.

1937~~~
Rafael not being picked on merit? So why was Van Persie picked week after week?

1938~~~
Different situations, it doesn't even make sense to compare them.

1939~~~
Wait, so Rafa has been fit for some time but simply hasn't been placed in the squad? Interesting, wasn't he doing quite well when he was playing?

1940~~~
Ultimately it's the same thing, merit. LvG's own words. BS double standards.

The worst bit is that Rafael's performances at RB have clearly been superior to Valencia's.

1941~~~
Rafael has always had a habit of going walk-about and ending up as a midfielder or centreforward for no good reason. This break could just be a part of the same van Gaal re-education program that Shaw was put through. On the other hand, he might think Rafael is a bit of a liability who's never going to be reliable enough. Whatever the case, I really hope it doesn't signal a permanent shift to 3-5-2 where Valencia is the preferred option at rwb. I don't mind AV, but 3 at the back makes me sad.

1942~~~
Valencia has been excellent the last few games and he is rarely injured. A good combination for a right back. Love Rafael but he has to fight for his place, same as any player here.

1943~~~
Seems strange to me if he's being left out entirely. Valencia has picked up but don't think he's been any better than rafael was.

I hope this isn't used as an excuse to play a 5 as we just don't look comfortable in that formation. Even if Valencia is playing well I don't think he's playing that well to justify the 5 when shaw/rojo are back.

1944~~~
The games he did play in a back four were at home against very weak opponents, and even then he was basically a wing back and we just used 2 defenders. Same with young. They never played as proper fullbacks.

1945~~~
As consistent as Valencia's performances have been there is a ceiling to what he can bring to the role, particularly when employed in a four. I would trust that this is a temporary stance partly influenced by the 3-5-2's preferred state at present.

And Rafael's fitness has in fact been better than one might have supposed, so there is that positive.

1946~~~
On the bench. That's a start.

1947~~~
Can he actually come on?

We really need to buy some fullbacks in January because its about time we ditched the 3-5-2.

1948~~~
Valenia has been steady and reliable when the team needed cover, however Rafael can bring more to the team's performance and indeed be one of the drivers behind any attacking momentum. I think he could well have made a difference against Villa today.

1949~~~
You're not saying anything. Why can't he be trusted? He's done nothing wrong on the pitch to warrant that. My only criticism is that he hasn't been as good going forward. Defensively he's been very, very sound.

1950~~~
Prediction.

He wont be starter RB next seasons. I dearly hope it isn't Alvez.

1951~~~
If the rumours are correct, it could be Clyne and maybe in january.

1952~~~
Hope so. Clyne looked great against Everton. Big fan of his.

1953~~~
His link up play and directness going forward is something that Valencia doesnt offer, thats something that van Gaal doesnt like. Valencia is predictable and decent, but not risky. Rafael on the other hand is impulsive and aggressive, that just doesnt suit the philosophy.

1954~~~
I'm a Rafael fan but I have no issue with Valencia being picked ahead of him. He earned the spot so he should keep it until he has a poor game or two.

1955~~~
Given Herrera and Fellaini are both likely to miss the Newcastle game I'd like to see us return to the diamond with Rafael at RB and Valencia on the right side of the diamond.

1956~~~
He's a bloody crock, massive fan of his but patience is running thin. Why has he been out most of the season anyway? 
We need a decent RB in the next 2 transfer windows

1957~~~
I was just thinking that today. I see he is going to Spurs. Probably didn't cost that much either.

1958~~~
In fairness Young and Valencia have been excellent. Hard to say they have been at fault as can't say Rafa hasn't had his own defensive lapses. To me it's down to LVG defensive set-up preference, and if it's 3 at the back, that changes everything in the future around personal. I suspect Rafa may go in the summer anyway.....to many mistakes in key moments in games.

1959~~~
Still don't see why he continues to get labelled with these big mistakes at key moments. I know he was rash and immature in his early days but it's something that he has improved greatly on. Every player is vulnerable to rash challenges and lapses in concentration but they don't get the same treatment as Rafael. He just seems to get labelled with it because of his past and not for what he actually produces now.

1960~~~
completely agree, I think people calling Rafael immature, making a lot of rash unwise challenges are really sick tbh. He is actually very consistent in his defending even he's got very aggressive style and commits himself a lot but unlike when he first arrived he very often wins those challenges and sets the counter attack which is in contrast to fullbacks who sits back deep and waiting the player to take them on, not only they risk the player will go past them, players like Hazard are very difficult to defend this way.. but they also have really poor starting position to start or support the attack something in which Rafael is brilliant. As for the Vardy challenge, it was nonsense from Clattenburg and every mature player can commit this kind of foul or get sent off but just because it is Rafael people are all crazy about him. Referees didn't like him either for the same reason - just because he is from south america, if he was english he would already be the best RB in the world and treated fairly.. The biggest problem is his injury record tho

1961~~~
There are certainly been improvements but their remains a rashness in his game that remains IMO. Yep every player as you say is vulnerable to this but with Rafa, you can almost predict them before they happen. There's not a utd fan who didn't see the Leicester incident happening at the time. I'm not seeing the maturity in his game I'd expect of a player that's played so many games here.....

1962~~~
I'm tired of this stereotype. It's lazy and baseless. How many mistakes has he done in key games in the past 3 seasons?

1963~~~
You're right, the referee also perceived it that way. That's why assessing incidents on the basis of past reputation is outrageously stupid. The Leicester "incident" was only an incident because the referee had the same silly outlook as you. It was not a foul, and the style in which Rafael runs on a football field shouldn't dictate decisions.

1964~~~
Couldn't have said it any better.

1965~~~
How the flying feck is that Leicester game still being used as a criticism of Rafael?!

1966~~~
You mean like how he got a yellow card on 12 mins against Chelsea and kept his head throughout the game up against Hazard?

1967~~~
Yeah, Rafael didn't even touch the forward who fell like he had been tackled. Really bad referring decision. We've seen others of late too(not our team but other teams) all of which have been bad referring decisions.

1968~~~
And that's not so very unusual these days either. Countless other players in the league might pick up early yellows with a similar frequency, however they avoid the "rash" tag.

1969~~~
Yes, when the West Brom game, when he was caught 5 yards behind our backline for the Berahino goal is just a much better example.

1970~~~
His discipline when it comes to cards is nothing out of the ordinary either. Zabaleta, apparently the second coming of Christ, is far more prone to picking up bookings. Then there's Ivanovic, who while legitimately brilliant, is one of the most horrible defenders in the division.

His fitness record is a problem, certainly. He's played a third of our games this season and that just isn't acceptable for what is now the second injury hit season in a row. A replacement of equal, if not better, ability is needed. The "rash" thing is just bollocks, however. He's a fiery footballer by nature, but long gone are the days he is costing us due to petulance or downright silly defending.

1971~~~
How stupid that I would make an assessment based on the past. Tell me how the club assesses a player they plan to sign? Do you think they call mystic Meg to find out they are going to do in the future?

The incident at Leicester, thats a matter of opinion but for me, he obviously reacted badly to being pushed off the ball. Not saying it happens every week but when it happens, always seems to be game changing moments. No different to him being in a Brazil shirt. Not suggesting he's not a good player but I always get the feeling that he's always only one game away from another changing incident.

1972~~~
Vardy dived and it was perfectly clear from the replays. Rafael was just running normally, trying to catch up to him as fast as he can. Don't blame Rafael for the ref's stupidity, please.

1973~~~
Countdown has started for the next injury.

1974~~~
Nice to see him get a run out, he's got a lot to do to get back in the starting line-up but I'd love to see him play the full game against Stoke as he's not had a proper try as a RWB yet.

1975~~~
Unless you are blind, it is a forward cheating the referee. You may be blind and avid fan of Man Utd following the game with audio commentary. In that case, please accept my apologies. That could also explain your feelings towards Rafael.

1976~~~
His worst performance this season.

1977~~~
Do blind and rafael not like each other or something?

1978~~~
I'm told it's just plain jealousy from Rafael because of Danny's looks.

1979~~~
Well, his cameo showed us why LvG hasn't started him yet. He is clearly not fit yet.

1980~~~
Will take a few weeks to get back. Valencia has been great but doesn't make players around him better like Rafael.

1981~~~
10 minutes and we were playing barely in 2nd gear and Newcastle couldn't be asked and saying he is not fit enough? Yeah clearly showed why LVG hasn't played him - nothing to do with that we are playing with wingbacks at all.

1982~~~
There seems to be some kind of change in his run ups, may be he had been trained in such a way to avoid future injuries.
Its just little cameo so I don't bother with his performance.

1983~~~
Blind? Bored more like. Like I said, it was clear he reacted badly when he was pushed of the ball and like Van Gaal said: “For the first penalty it is always the referee [who you talk about] but you don’t have to do that as a player. You know you are in the penalty area and you allow the referee to whistle if you make a challenge......"

Not saying he's not a good player, but when he has one of his 'moments' always feel like they are turning points in games. Maybe he's just unlucky.....

1984~~~
Did he even go so far as to make a challenge?

The referee made two bad decisions in quick succession [although you might argue that he was conned for the penalty], and Rafael was on the receiving end for both.

1985~~~
Good to see him come on.

1986~~~
Looked really poor today. Hopefully it's down to match fitness.

1987~~~
Looks like he'll need to replace Valencia for a while. He'll need to shape up quickly. Looked really dodgy when he came on.

1988~~~
Not his usual self. Could be down to lack of sharpness

1989~~~
Love him but he was poor today in fairness. I just don't think he is suited to a fullback roll to be honest, either that or he lacked fitness. 

Hope he gets back to his best asap, he's a vital player for us when fit.

1990~~~
A new RB just became a priority during the January transfer window. Rafael is a liability.

1991~~~
It was a priority anyway. The final remark is simply nonsense.

1992~~~
Yeah, a split second late at everything. That'l come with match time.

1993~~~
An awful wingback. Lost without anyone playing ahead of him and his crossing is pathetic.

1994~~~
Utter nonsense.

1995~~~
He was rusty after a long lay off and thrown on at HT into a very scrappy game. I think we can give him some slack for that.

1996~~~
He was shit because he lacked match fitness today. Which would be okay if he wasn't injured a lot. We know how good he can be when he has a sustained run, but the fact that rarely happens makes him a liability. I love the guy but we simply can't trust him. We need a reliable right back, it's as much a priority as any other position.

1997~~~
The caf in kneejerk overreactions shocker.

1998~~~
LvG looked angry after one of his feck ups. And it's obvious he's not a wingback.

1999~~~
He's a good crosser. Looked rusty which is to be expected.

2000~~~
Wing back?

2001~~~
Clearly lacking match sharpness.

2002~~~
Love the kneejerk reactions after 45 minutes of football where the whole team's performance dropped. Especially Charleysurf who usually can't wait to throw in a dig at Rafael.

2003~~~
He had a role in some of our most dangerous moves of the second half, what few there were. 

Stoke will probably adopt a similar approach to Tottenham in the second half, and given how the 3-5-2 coped with such we might see a change in tactics, a decision which could suit Rafael.

2004~~~
Is it? The only chance we created on the second half was from his cross. If I am not mistaken, that was also his only cross today.

2005~~~
Clearly not fit. Thought he was relatively poor but who wasn't in that abomination of a second half.

2006~~~
He's a terrible crosser. When he does get it right he can put in a great ball but 9 out of 10 are dreadful. Either terribly scuffed or ballooned over everyone.

2007~~~
I don't think he's a good crosser. Improvement on Valencia, but he's not really great.

2008~~~
Yea, i meant wing back. Edited.

2009~~~
With no overlap for him to use he struggled a bit but did put one on a plate for Mata.

2010~~~
I will always be a fan because I can see lots ability in him but his lack of cleverness is a real weakness to the team. 

Needs to be smarter, but to be fair we have a few players like this. Rafa's just the worst of the bunch though.

2011~~~
My opinion is formed by more than 1 game. Also that particular cross was clearly a scuff

2012~~~
Good, not great.

I dont even know what to say to that. Calling Rafael a terrible crosser and saying 90% of his crosses are dreadful is plain wrong. Even today, he put a wonderful ball in for Mata.

2013~~~
You must be watchin too many highlights. He'll put in the odd beauty but he's ridiculously wasteful. He's said himself that he has to improve his crossing

2014~~~
During Rafael's 6-8 game run earlier in the season he and Di Maria were arguably our two most creative outlets, so some of the responses in here are really quite remarkable.

2015~~~
How does him saying he has to improve his crossing make him a terrible crosser? He's not a great crosser so yeah, he can definitely improve in that regard. Calling him terrible is plain nonsense though.

2016~~~
Lack match sharpness, but he still dives in unnecessarily, at times. Glad he's back, though. Although Valencia and Young have been great at wingback, with Rafael and now Shaw back, hopefully we'll go back to a back four.

2017~~~
It's always the same when a player comes back from injury. They look rusty and plenty of the people with agendas are straight on their back. Give Rafael a few games to get his fitness and I'm sure they will all drop back into hiding until the next time he has a bad game.

2018~~~
Bit crap. Bit rusty. Would like to see him start the next game though. Valencia's looking very leggy.

2019~~~
Nah, give him a few games before he gets injured.

2020~~~
Shocking but hasn't played for a while.

Utlimatley he will play his way back into form and be lauded as the best RB in the league before getting injured again.

Same old Rafael.

2021~~~
As has been said, a bit rusty and that was a hard game for him to come into. It was quick, feisty and he needed his touch and wits about him which he didn't really have.

2022~~~
For a player that many consider should be starting wing back for us, basically the only outlet on the right hand side, it's terrible. 

His strength is as a fullback in a back 4 overlapping his winger as a spare man. When he has to try and beat a man to make space to  cross a ball when running at pace he's very poor.

2023~~~
I want to give him the benefit of the doubt after being out for so long but he's so reckless most of the time anyway...

Valencia doesn't create enough down the right and Rafael can be a liability and is so injury prone I wouldn't be surprised if we strengthened there in the window.

2024~~~
Not a particularly impressive performance but then there weren't any in that second half. I still much prefer him to Valencia as you have some hope he could do something exciting when he picks up the ball, even if he does take more risks in the process.

2025~~~
Didn't look great against Newcastle and Spurs but to be expected after coming back from such a long layoff. Contingency plans need to be made in the summer though if Rafael doesn't get his shit sorted as he isn't that good that he can't be replaced.

2026~~~
There arent many Baines's around. I dont know how you can call his crossing terrible. How many RBs are out there who are better crossers? Must be plenty seeing as he's "terrible".

The 2nd part of your post is true for most fullbacks. Actually feel Rafael's good in that regard too, more often than not, he makes a yard for himself and gets the ball in.

2027~~~
He comes on, kicks/fouls someone gets booked, gets injured. That's Rafael in a nut shell. I stand by my comment.

2028~~~
He made two fouls. Not really a big deal, albeit the second one was particularly silly. We were giving away too many as a team during the last twenty minutes.

Injuries are a probem, yes, you're right. And I stand by what I said. Liability is nonsense, most certainly after 45 minutes of football in a very tough game.

2029~~~
he does give away fouls...but it was very good to have the lad back. Valencia has done a job in his absence...but I still prefer Rafael.

2030~~~
We will be a better team once he gets sharp. Today he was poor but deserves some time to get back to his best. It's not like he's a big downgrade on Valencia anyway, who was beating his man with ease but then offered no end product.

2031~~~
Obviously I'm in the minority, but I thought it was a breath of fresh air to have him on the pitch after one dimensional Valencia. Actually was trying to create things, picking early passes etc

Obviously a bit rusty, but what do people expect? 

People have such high expectations for certain players that when they don't immediately match them, they can't wait to criticise. That's why Nani has no chance unless he performs like Ronaldo every week, but Young just has to avoid diving to get an 8 rating.

2032~~~
I thought he was pretty poor, but he's lacking sharpness due to fitness, he still gives away pathetic, idiotic freekicks where a more deft player like Carrick would just stand off half a yard and cut off a passing lane rather than try and go through the player to win the ball in area's that aren't immediately dangerous.

2033~~~
Was poor but, as others have said, a lot of that was down to rustiness.

Not sure why that brief cameo would change anyone's opinions of Rafael. 

Anyway, Valencia could use a break so we'd better take advantage of Rafael's return to fitness while we can.

2034~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2035~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Or has to dive to get a pen in which case he gets a 11.

2036~~~
Good to see him back. Have to laugh at some of the reactions on here though.

I think in a few weeks of games, he will get that sharpness back and nail down a spot, hopefully the same with Shaw so we can revert to a back four.

2037~~~
Nani has had more chances than most! And no one expects him to play like Ronaldo every week or in fact any week.

2038~~~
No it wasn't. He had a few, and its annoying that he never looks up when he crosses. He just hits it. Even the chance he created in the second half came from a Valencia-like blind cross into the box. Also, he's a decent dribbler with decent pace but he seldom tries to take on players. He's capable of much better than today, he needs fitness.

2039~~~
Hope he starts against Stoke.. Much better going forward than Valencia.

2040~~~
Rafael's been free from injury for what, nearly a month? I don't know if he saw any action with the reserves/U-21s but given a time and a little luck he'll be back to the influential player the team had earlier on this season.


How he manages to pick out Rooney here must be down to his concealed psychic abilities then.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dsGCS_F9rRk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2041~~~
Still think he's our long term right back, only player i would take over him would probably be coleman although he would cost 20 mil

2042~~~
You can't use the example of just one game, but fair play. I still stand by what I said, Rafael is very hit and miss with his crossing. I did say he's capable of better did I not?

2043~~~
Glad to have him back. Not a good day at the office, but expecting him to get back to form quickly if he gets a run. Think once he does, he'll help create a lot of space for Mata/Rooney/di Maria to exploit

2044~~~
Clearly lacking some match fitness. The overreaction that happens on here is crazy. One thing that bothers me about him though is that a lot of the time he crosses the ball as it is behind him, in that he always seems to have to dig the cross out (if that makes sense). His touch never seems to put the ball in front of him.

2045~~~
Valencia deserves to remain as first choice, even if we go back to a four man defence.

2046~~~
Thought he deserved an assist for the cross Mata blasted over from 6 yards away. Pretty decent comeback I thought.

2047~~~
Give him a break. Just returned and had to play with tired players. He was not good today though. Still created our best chance of the half. Mata skied it.

2048~~~
I love him and if Mata had finished his chance everyone would be buzzing about him.

2049~~~
I would have had a wet dream over Rafael setting a goal up for Mata.

2050~~~
some posters in here are utter vomit. The state of the criticism of some players this weekend, yikes.

2051~~~
He seems a little short in confidence at the moment.

The way he is dribbling, he has his head down seeming as if he is only looking to focus on being careful and not messing up, and therefore is not looking up enough when he's with the ball. If you compare the way he was dribbling with the ball against Spurs compared to West Ham, you'll see the difference.

We've seen Rafael in his stride, he's a confident fast dribbler, capable of producing a fine delivery. I'm sure the more run of games he gets, the more likely he will be his old self again, just need a little bit of patience.

2052~~~
Why do we always need such posts that make sense after all the drama queens before have spoken?

2053~~~
I honestly dislike this 'tired' players excuse. I know we started the same starting 11, but Spurs should've been tired as well and they had more energy in the second half. They're no excuses for our shitty second half performances.

2054~~~
And roles were completely reversed first half. It's not an alien concept for home teams to grow into games and away to tire.

2055~~~
All our young and talented defenders have terrible injury records, and we'll have to wait and see how Shaw will do. It'll be another 5 years before he is physically fully grown and if you look at how much Jones, Rafael and Smalling have struggled and still do, well I just hope that will not apply to Shaw. 

I don't really see the problem with Rafael, the moment he is fit and gets into form he will definitely add a completely other dimension to our right hand side. He already had some excellent moments this season. Antionio has done a great job too covering for him. Coleman is a good player but not as good as Rafael. Plus bringing a new right back in might mean Valencia has to leave, surely Van Gaal doesn't see him as a winger (especially with Young doing very well attackingly, he could play on both wings)?

2056~~~
It doesn't stem from being tired, its the home team growing in confidence and going for the win. We've looked piss poor in games at home too in the second half. LVG has mentioned this more than once.

2057~~~
If we bring in a new right back, then Rafael will leave not Valencia. 

And for me Coleman is currently better.

2058~~~
We would let one of the most talented right backs in the -25 age category go, and keep a player who's not really a right back? Would surprise me.

2059~~~
Completely disagree there. 

Van Gaal trusts Rafael at right back, he only trusts Valencia at RWB. He's not going to sell our only other player capable of playing RB in a back four. 

I do think Rafael is a good bet for "shock" transfer though this summer. I can see us buying two right backs and moving him on. It won't be a straight choice between Valencia or Rafael to leave though as they play different positions.

2060~~~
One point I would make is that even if Coleman isn't better than Rafael (which is in itself very debatable) then he is still arguably a better option if you're switching between using them as fullbacks/wingbacks given that he has plenty of experience playing as an out and out winger and is much more of a goal threat.

Anyway, you highlighted Rafael's big problem yourself. He's fine when he's fit and in form but, unfortunately, we have little reason to belief he can stay fit and in form given his injury record. 

I don't see a problem in having competition between a new RB + whichever of Rafael/Valencia LVG prefers.

2061~~~
What's the point of keeping a player who can't stay fit? 

You seem to forgotten that Van Gaal played Valencia at right back vs City and we played 4 at the back that game. He's only gone to 5 due to Young being there too. If Shaw was fit, then I'm sure we'd be playing 4 at the back. 

Like I said, if we sign another right back then it perhaps signals the end for Rafael rather than Valencia.

2062~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCYqWHtbIZc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

And look who was an absolute country mile out of position and left Smalling completely exposed to get his second yellow. He hasn't played RB since.

2063~~~
He played right back against Palace and Stoke. And has played right back under Moyes and Fergie in the past, so let's not make out its alien to him unlike Young.

If Rafael stays fit then we have no reason to sign another fullback. As Valencia could provide cover for the few games. The only reason we need to sign a new fullback is if Rafael can't stay fit.

2064~~~
We had our 4 first choice centrebacks out against Palace so had no choice while we played with 3 at the back (Carrick CCB) and Valencia at RWB against Stoke. 


Jones and Smalling were also played to death at RB by Moyes and Fergie yet Van Gaal would never dream of it so I don't get your point?

2065~~~
Even then we might not need to sign a new one. Rojo, Shaw and Blind for the left back, Rafael, Jones, Valencia/Young for right back could be in Van Gaals head too, depending on fitness/injuries of the squad. In an away game vs. a top 4 team or against a good European side I could see him wanting Phil Jones at right back over Valencia for instance.

2066~~~
We played 4 at the back vs Stoke and Palace. Carrick was the centre of the diamond with Fellaini on the right. 

Jones and Smalling haven't even been fit enough for them to give Van Gaal that option. 

Answer this. Why would we look to sign a new right back, when we have Rafael? You even admitted yourself he could go. I don't see Valencia going anywhere considering he can play in three different positions for us.

2067~~~
Depending on how durable Rafael is for the remainder of the season [i have no qualms about him regaining his form], an ideal signing would be a decent albeit somewhat ageing defender who can fill in at both RB and CB. Wes Brown with a case of Benjamin Button.

2068~~~
If Rafael can't stay fit, then we need to sign another right back. 

This changing the defence every game you may like just for Rafael. But I'm not a fan of. Chelsea have the best defence because they never change it. We will never get that consistency if likes of Rafael can't stay fit. I don't care how talented they are. We shouldn't have to change the defence every game.

Our best teams under Fergie everyone knew what the back 4 was.

2069~~~
Did you read my original post? I said we need another right back, if he doesn't feel Rafael is a reliable option for right back he will buy two right backs. It's not a choice between Valencia or Rafael as Valencia is not a right back as Van Gaal has stressed recently.

2070~~~
I did and I said we only need one right back. Not waste money on another one. Considering Valencia has played there since the Man City game. 

Yeah and unfair to pick out one mistake against City, when Smalling himself was an idiot for diving in like that when on a yellow.

2071~~~
I really don't get this line of thought. Why would we limit ourselves to either Valencia or a "decent albeit somewhat ageing defender" as cover for Rafael? I don't see what the advantage of that is as opposed to actually signing a top quality RB. 

Take Azpilicueta at Chelsea as example. Roughly the same age as Rafael, far less injury prone and (by some distance) a better player. Chelsea could have easily brought in a "decent" option as back up for him yet instead they went for a top quality 28 year old La Liga winner to provide genuine competition/back up. Why the hell wouldn't we try to do the same with our team? It would leave us in a far, far stronger position than signing a decent veteran or sticking with an out of position winger.

I'd get it if money was an issue but that doesn't seem to be at all the case atm. So why settle?

2072~~~
He played one game there when we had four centrebacks out. 

Asked about Valencia and Young Van Gaal replied:

“As wingbacks, not as fullbacks, because now am more or less obliged to play with wingbacks because the real fullbacks, Shaw and Rafael Da Silva were not fit enough and that’s not good, I have to select what I want and now I am forced to select and for a manager that’s not so good.”


That tells you everything you need to know.

2073~~~
Because CB, CM and winger should be our priority.

2074~~~
Because if Rafael does indeed demonstrate an acceptable level of fitness between now and the end of the season, i don't think we need act as you suggest. I'd sooner promote a promising youth player or try and kill two birds with stone with regard the the fragility of the centre backs. 

I can think of at least three positions of higher priority. 

If such a policy brought us success in the past i fail to see why it shouldn't be considered in the present.

2075~~~
It tells me that Van Gaal does not trust having both Valencia and Young as fullbacks in the same team. 

But if one of Shaw or Rafael were fit alongside them then I'm sure he wouldn't play 5 at the back. 

I'd leave it that.

2076~~~
Right on cue, Jamie Jackson has been following you on the caf, even got the price right:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/31/manchester-united-seamus-coleman-transfer-target-everton" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...united-seamus-coleman-transfer-target-everton</a>

No quotes from van Gaal about Coleman.

2077~~~
I love Rafael, but we need another right back (not Valencia, if it means changing the formation when he plays). If Rafael could stay fit for most of the time, we could have settled for a good but not great right back. But since he misses such big chunks, I don't think it would be enough.

2078~~~
Im inclined to call it bs just because its Jamie Jackson but it sounds quite convincing really <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2079~~~
I admire the patience with some of our fans with regards to Rafael. 
Sadly, I don't ever see him putting in a full shift due to his injury record.

2080~~~
Rafael is 24 and hasn't made much progress in three years. He's injury prone to boot. If we're serious about challenging the likes of Bayern and Real Madrid next season we need a dependable RB. Too much sentimentality with him. Fabio was just like him, injury prone as well but the difference is Rafa had no competition whatsoever so he got more games while Fabio couldn't usurp even a declining Evra.

2081~~~
They did look very similar.

2082~~~
I always thought so myself. Thought I was the only one

2083~~~
I think the patience (at least up to this point) was justified tbh.
When fit hes been very good and looked one of the best rb's in europe.
Hes been put up against some great wingers and handeled them reasonably well.

I dont know, seems a few managers in a row dont really rate him so you have to question his training or mentality.
Hes been dropped for valencia for a few games now though. 
Is that because Van Gaal doesn't have a left fb so wants to stick with the 3-5-2 till shaw is fit too?
Can understand valencia being preferable as a wing back.

Or is he dropped because van gaal just doesn't rate him?

2084~~~
I'd like to see Varela given a chance.

2085~~~
I think Real would disagree there.

2086~~~
Should start tomorrow and he'll show everyone his worth. Come on Rafa, don't feck up.

2087~~~
He won't start, Young on the right, Shaw on the left

He is a calamity, and LvG understood this, fortunately.

2088~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2089~~~
Not sure if this is the right contest for him to come on. We need height to combat their set pieces.

2090~~~
He's certainly been more threatening than Young on the right.

2091~~~
We should have started both Rafael and Shaw, that much is plain.

2092~~~
Ehh, we should have started him at RWB and Young on the other side. Shaw was man-marking on corners so maybe that has something to do with why Rafael didn't start today.

2093~~~
How did he do? I missed most of the second half.

2094~~~
Better than Spurs, so will hopefully start the next game and get a run going. He's vital to our attacking play down the right.

2095~~~
Did ok when he came on. A close comparison with Clyne coming up soon...

2096~~~
A blessing for you then. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

As regards Rafael though, it is as much about the fact that he'll take a chance and try something where Valencia/Young will not. This could be exemplified by a couple of occasions where he he cut inside and drove at their defence with the ball rather than crossing.

2097~~~
His chance now to re-claim the FB/WB spot.

2098~~~
Should start vs Yeovil and then get a run behind him hopefully, will be needed with Valencia and Young now out.

2099~~~
You lucky git.

2100~~~
I thought he was looking a little like himself compared to the Spurs calamity. Found it surprising that he didn't start though really... I'm not sure if LVG doesn't rate him as a wing back, or just doesn't rate him full stop.

2101~~~
Did alright, nothing wrong, nothing special that makes you take notice. Not enough time to really have an impact probably

2102~~~
That's one thing I like to see, it's why I always preferred Nani to Valencia, I'd rather see a player deemed an attacker try something and fail, than not try at all.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It's also a new position for him really, I guess now with Young injured him and Shaw will resume their normal roles in a back 4.

2103~~~
I remain a Rafael admirer, but wouldn't mind seeing Varela brought up or Coleman brought in to challenge him for the right back spot.

2104~~~
You do know that Varela is at Real Madrid B on loan right? I don't think he's coming back.

2105~~~
so how many seasons do we have to play with backup right-backs until people realize that we cant rely on Rafael? Its possible to have injury pron attacking players, because its easier to rotate in this area, but defenders have to be stay fit for the majority of a season or they become a burden.

2106~~~
He's not first-choice anyway. It has become pretty obvious that LVG prefers Valencia, at least in the 3-5-2. Think it's basically 50/50 in the 4-4-2.

2107~~~
Like all of our defence then?

2108~~~
There has to be a distinct plan how to deal with Smalling, Jones and Rafael. The manager has to make a decision if he can handle them being injured all the time. It certainly cant be a excuse for bad performances anymore.

2109~~~
This is it really, we can’t talk about injuries as a reason to get rid of a player without getting rid of our entire backline, we would need to buy about 7 or 8 players FFS.

2110~~~
Not only that but is Valencia really that bad of an understudy? I think Rafael and Valencia are an adequate first and second choice full back. Obviously if Rafael can't get fit we need a new right back, but it certainly isn't a priority in my opinion. We need a winger, a central defender and possibly even a box to box CM before a right back.

2111~~~
Injured again, sell the waster.

2112~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> made of glass

Bring in a new right back immediately.

2113~~~
Smalling or Jones at RB again. Feck.   Gotta get that new RB this month.

2114~~~
Was it definitely an injury?

2115~~~
feck it, make a bid for clyne. that's both full back positions sorted for the next decade or so

2116~~~
A right back has to be bought this month, even if it's a stop gap like Srna.

2117~~~
Yeah, had enough now. Was shite today and gets injured again.

2118~~~
How the feck. Didn't seem injured. I love the guy but we can't have a first choice player as injury prone as him. Buy someone else, keep him as cover and if he gets over the injuries, all the better for us.

2119~~~
We're getting a new RB next summer.

2120~~~
Mods should ban "When Rafael's fit, he is...".

feck off.

2121~~~
Hang on, what's this injury talk? Didn't Shaw come off at the same time? Can't both have been injured surely.

2122~~~
This is a joke right?

2123~~~
That's what van Gaal has said.

2124~~~
Is it confirmed as an injury?

2125~~~
I think the whole centre back scenario is far more pressing. We've got 3 there who make Rafael look ever available.

2126~~~
No way we should sell but we should definitely by a (first choice) right back who can be relied upon to play more games than not.

2127~~~
We have to move in January now. It's an absolute must. feck all that "we don't do short term fixes". It's exactly what we need right now. We have no freaking fullbacks.

2128~~~
Got injured, played shit again, Coleman here we come!

2129~~~
Sorry but if he's injured then I've lost hope in him. Beyond a joke.

2130~~~
If that's true, then replacing him is an absolute priority (and yes, Coleman would be ideal.) I like the way Rafael plays (ie. he's not afraid to actually drive forward and beat a man,) but he is incapable of staying out of the treatment room.

2131~~~

2132~~~
Just not acceptable. Such a shame. A right back is probably our biggest priority, to be honest.

2133~~~
Why shouldn't we sell? If he can't stay fit then there's no point keeping him.

2134~~~
See you. Cannot carry this guy as much as I rate him. Crocked.

2135~~~
I'd say the penny has dropped now. He's a popular player and a likable lad, but I think we're all fed up with him now at this stage.

2136~~~
Okay, so maybe it's an injury we can't really criticise him for. But still, he is ridiculously injury prone.

2137~~~
Fractured cheekbone

2138~~~
Yep. Time for a new one.

2139~~~
Exactly. Enough is enough and it's bad luck for the lad but we need a right back. Really hope we won't be paying him 100k+ to sit on the bench we have enough of those players

2140~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px">@DTguardian: Louis van Gaal here in press conference says Rafael da Silva has a fractured cheekbone and Luke Shaw has ankle injury #mufc</span>

2141~~~
Does this mean 3-5-2 will continue <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2142~~~
My God. 

I said in the Match Day thread I thought it was unnecessary for them to come off if we're switching to a back 4 so I take all that back obviously.

2143~~~
How long can one be out with a fractured cheekbone? Put a helmet on him and be done with it.

2144~~~
Should be bidding for Clyne or Coleman, both are at least as good if not better and aren't always injured.

2145~~~
Not til they start playing for us anyway.

2146~~~
This is fecking ridiculous. The more it goes, the more I want both Tony Strudwick and Steve McNally to get sacked for getting poor return on our players' fitness and health levels.<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2147~~~
LvG interview, fracture apparently.
Shaw also injured.

2148~~~
Get thee to a knacker's yard.

2149~~~
Fractured cheekbone apparently, while Shaw has an ankle problem yet again. Great.

2150~~~
He's still young and has a lot of quality, plus loves the club and probably isn't on that much money (by United standards). If the injury problems persist for another few years then maybe we'd unfortunately have to consider it but not until then for me. I'll admit I love Rafa more than most others here so I understand people thinking otherwise.

2151~~~
Fractured cheekbone. I think we should all calm it a little, in fairness. That can happen to anyone at any time.

2152~~~
Don't know how some can blame him for this. This injury has nothing to do with being injury prone, a lot of bad luck. 

Agree we should buy another RB, but people seeing a fractured cheekbone as a reason to stop believing in him...

2153~~~
He'll be fine.

2154~~~
SOS Seamus Coleman.

We'll probably have to pay an exhorbitant amount, but feck it, lets get him.

2155~~~
A fractured cheekbone is hardly something you can pin the blame on him for. Luke Shaw was a 30 mil left back and all he's done is spend time in the treatment room. I'd say we should buy a right back though, Valencia isn't good enough. Coleman has been average this season too, and Clyne wasn't wanted by hardly anyone before this season so I'd rather we don't overspend like we did for sicknote Shaw.

2156~~~
Am I the only one that is shocked that we only changed to back 4 because they got injured

2157~~~
He did look like he got knocked loopy early on.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2158~~~
When I started typing Rafael Da Silva into google the first think that came up was "injury".

2159~~~
Fractured cheekbone. Not really his fault, in fairness.

2160~~~
Unfortunate but that will be his undoing here because I don't see LVG tolerating this beyond the end of the season. I like him very much but it's time we sign a first choice RB and relegate him to a squad role, how can we have any fluency in our play when players are always in and out of the team.

2161~~~
He would probably start getting injured too if he came here(plus he is not that good).

2162~~~
He was the best RB in the league last year.

2163~~~
Mediocre player and always injured

2164~~~
He'd instantly become our best full-back/wing-back.

2165~~~
Pathetic comments tbh. He got head-butted on his cheekbone and somehow that's his fault?

2166~~~
I don't think people are blaming him directly, it's just built up frustration because he is always injured, understandable really. It's at the point now where you have to say enough is enough

2167~~~
Is the Caf love in affair with this crock finally over? Good RB at best and not fancied by anyone other than rose tinted United fans. Ok, todays injury is not really his fault but he is so injury prone it's untrue.  I really, really hope LvG chooses to get rid and buy a replacement sooner rather than later.

2168~~~
He is injured again? 
Was it sthing serious?

2169~~~
Van Gaal might have more regard for him than I thought:

2170~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Didn't even realise he got injured until just now. Don't know why I'm surprised. 

I would be surprised if we don't bring a RB in this January now though.

2171~~~
More concerned about Shaw tbf.

2172~~~
Yep, it's nothing new with Rafael, we know he's unreliable and ridiculously injury prone... But it's becoming a major issue with Shaw now.

2173~~~
First of all this injury isn't down to a weak body or a reoccurring injury, he got a knock ffs. 

Secondly its only a fractured cheek bone, with an injection and/or one of those Zoro mask he should be able play at the weekend.

2174~~~
Yeah, everything you said is true, but you know what else is true? Rafael is insanely injury prone, and will never be a reliable player for us.

2175~~~
great! 

Is Jones fit?

Play him at RB and for the love of God switch to 4 at the back.

2176~~~
But he's probably gonna be close to 90 minute fitness by Sunday to face Southampton, so once he adds to us beating them its fine in my books.  One game at a time.

2177~~~
The right-back position remains an issue in our squad that will have to be rectified in the summer, think we'll get by 'til then.

2178~~~
Or until one gets injured. Or both.

2179~~~
That always, always, sounds really painful.

2180~~~
Rafael probably injure himself reading the word.

2181~~~
You don't hit a football with a cheek most of the time so get on with it and play.

2182~~~
I don't think he'll be out for long. He played on after the injury until half time, and it happened fairly early on. I think he could even play next weekend if he has it strapped up or wears a mask. If it was a severe fracture, I think he would have come off right away. I'm just guessing though.

2183~~~
Eh?
An injury is an injury, no matter where it is on the body.

2184~~~
He can't find form after last injury. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2185~~~
I unfortunately have to agree with this. He looked like he can become a top FB but he barely can stay fit for five games in a row which also means that he most likely will never get the playing time to really fulfill his potential a bit like with Smalling and Jones unfortunately. What's the use of having talented defenders if all they will ever be are talents that never get going due to being to injury prone. I say all three of them need a good alternative that can be a starter for us and if the injury prone bunch can't compete with them then it's time to say goodbye sooner or later.

2186~~~
I think he will soon be called fat and lazy bastard as some other Brazilian footballer who used to be top prospect but his career was absolutely ruined by never ending injuries. Because that is it - mediocre, liability - it's the new injured.

Credit to him that he finished the half. Feel very sorry for him, he is so unlucky. Anyway I think we should definitely look somewhere else to bring at least some cover for him and maybe even for Shaw that is why I feel we should go for someone like Clyne who can play on both flanks or maybe someone quite stupid shouldn't had acted so stupid and kept Guillermo Varela in the team as he could do the job on both flanks as well. He would have plenty of playing time now. He was good enough and so similar to Rafael. I don't see the point sending him out on loan to Castilla.. very disappointed with this decision..

2187~~~
Get a batman mask on him and get on with it.

2188~~~
A non-injury prone full back would have absorbed that headbutt like a heavyweight champ, and his opponent would have been stretchered off with a brain hemorrhage, and later forced to retire from the game.

But no. Rafael had to have the skull of a human being, and that's below the level we expect. He should be sold this month. But who is going to want to invest in a player with a skull that can't even take a solid midair headbutt?

We should bring in Dani Alves. He's the wrong side of 30, but I once saw him stop a moving train with his chin. He's made of better stuff than Rafael and his bones made of dog biscuits.

2189~~~
You have to feel sorry for Rafael.  It's not as though he doesn't oyt in the effort.  The man is just really unlucky with injuries.

2190~~~
I don't think anyone is criticizing him for his current injury, just the bigger picture.

2191~~~
Oddly enough this latest injury may be a blessing for Rafael in that it's clearly earned him a lot of respect from LvG, and I can't imagine he gives it lightly.

2192~~~
Get over it and help us.

2193~~~
I said this only a few days ago, that each of our defenders can last only 4-5 games (they are all made of glass).
I never expected him to get injured after only 1 start. An impressive feat.

What really brought it home to me was when we played Stoke - those players looked like tough men. Our players looked like a bunch of models who would throw a fit if they broke a nail.
In general, we need 2-3 defenders who are physically strong and able to take a beating and get back up.
Jones, Evans, Rafael, Shaw, Smalling, Rojo - every single one of them is made of glass.
Perhaps these defenders all need to spend a week or 2 with a local Rugby team, to toughen up.

I dont blame Rafael, per se. I blame our entire back line. Rafael is just fitting in to the "I'm too injured to play a 90 minute game" culture.

2194~~~
Yeah. And the Left Back Position.
And the 3 CB positions.
All our defenders are made of glass.
Very frustrating.

2195~~~
Ask him to wear that Batman mask. Why do you think footballers wear that after an injury to the face?

2196~~~
We have no idea what type or how serious the injury is. If it turns out not to be serious then fair enough, but taking him off was the best thing to do. However it's not always as simple as sticking a mask on his face.

2197~~~
It's staying on the pitch for as long as possible with a fractured cheekbone that goes a long way towards gaining respect and adoration from the fanbase. He isn't liked by many for no reason. His attitude really does embody what I consider the club to be all about. Hopefully he can wear one of those daft masks.

2198~~~
Did well to play on for as long as he did. He looked really groggy out there.

2199~~~
You don't want to talk down a player you are preparing to sell.

2200~~~
Seriously though, who would buy a player who is constantly injured? Those of you wanting to get rid of our injury prone players need to consider this. We cannot buy from ourselves.

2201~~~
Rafael's a good player, if he can get a run going in the side he will be fine.

2202~~~
I would hate to see him sold and then suddenly he is fit for a different club.

2203~~~
How long do players normally take to come back from a fractured cheek?

2204~~~
Fair fecks for him to play through that injury. Must be as frustrated as anyone about this constant injuries. Can't he use a mask to play?

2205~~~
A fractured cheek can be tricky. It can be extremely painful, so even with the mask as protection, the pain (every step jolts up to the jaw) is unbearable to play. Probably be 4 or 5 days before we hear anything.

2206~~~

2207~~~
In case anyone doesn't bother to click the instagram link it says he'll be back training on Friday but with a mask on.

2208~~~
Good news, hopefully he and Shaw are okay for Southampton, it's time for a four man defence.

2209~~~
He's a tough little so-and-so. 

I'd be out for at least two weeks, and demand 24 hour nursing care.

2210~~~
Out of curiosity does anyone know what the operation was?

2211~~~
He had a fractured cheek bone so something to do with that I guess

2212~~~
He's the toughest most fragile player in the Premier League, Jones is a close second.

2213~~~
He should thank surgeons.

2214~~~
Yea I know. Sorry, I probably should have been more specific. I'm amazed you can have any sort of operation and be back training 3 days later, so I'm just curious what the operation was that means he can be back playing so soon.

2215~~~
His bones would need to be re-aligned and if required fixed in places so it can heal. Its surgery on his face likely through his mouth so no reason he can't be back in training in a few days. His face may will be sore thats all.

2216~~~
Yeah god sucks as a surgeon... Stuffing people with plagues,floods and other anoying stuff he's the boss..

2217~~~
Rafael in a mask <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2218~~~
He probably thanked God for giving him the good surgeons

2219~~~
Fantastic news. hope shaw gets a clean bill of health as well.

2220~~~
Woody will be on the blower setting up a sponsorship deal for Rafael's mask, brand that shit!

2221~~~
Good to hear he is ok and ready to train as soon as Friday.

2222~~~
Shaw and Rafa back for Sunday, get it! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2223~~~
Blind and Rojo possibly too. Can't wait !!

2224~~~
Fractured cheekbone. Smiling ear to ear. Proper boiiiiii!

2225~~~
We've been saying that for years..

2226~~~
Amazing how, when they want to roll out cliches about him, people forget the games where Rafa's been up against Bale, Ronaldo, Hazard etc. and done better than most. 2012-13 wasn't that long ago boys...

2227~~~
Average RB.

2228~~~
You may recall that Rafael was one of the club's highest appearance makers during the 2012/13 season, as well as being amongst the team's best performers throughout the campaign.  And he actually started in excess of 25 matches last term, however like many others suffered from the tactics and general approach of the side under Moyes management.

2229~~~
Doubt it. Both Shaw and Rafa will probably get back next week. Full weeks training whilst they've had an injury.

2230~~~
Well just 2 years ago he was brilliant all year. We should get somebody and have him fight for the starting position with Rafael, so either Rafael makes it his own and gets over his injuries or just remains cover and we have somebody else starting.

2231~~~
He's been the RB for most of our best performances this season and played a key role. Still think he'll figure into LVG's plans if he can just stay healthy

2232~~~
Don't rule it out. Shaw has been passed fit and Rafael is apparently free to play with a mask. As he's "match fit" and it's nly a facial injury and we are without Valencia and Young I wouldn't rule it out.

2233~~~
He could be hit by a truck and still smiling. Great spirit and good to have him back soon indeed.

2234~~~
so batman and robin against Soton? he should wear rugby headguard and some other stuff too in order to keep him out of injuries. Great player we will need him..

2235~~~
You probably wouldn't receive the same quality of treatment to begin with.

2236~~~
Sadly this is probably his last chance to show he can stay fit. And this is coming fro. His biggest fan. Also, I'm not sure LVG rates him as high as Fergie. Sigh

2237~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.chillisauce.co.uk/images/340501-340600/340540.jpg?maxwidth=307&amp;maxheight=205" src="http://www.chillisauce.co.uk/images/340501-340600/340540.jpg?maxwidth=307&amp;maxheight=205"/>

2238~~~
Yet before and since then he has been plagued by niggling injuries. with every season that goes past and every injury he picks up, 2012/13 looks more and more like the exception rather than the norm. It's a crying shame though. Not only is he one of our most important players, but he's also one of the most god-damn likeable.

2239~~~
The mask

2240~~~
I hope he gets a cape too.

2241~~~
Full marks.

2242~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I'm not proud of how long it took me to get this, but I got there in the end

2243~~~
When has Rafael played at wing back? Slightly in pre-season, then a post-injury 100 minutes split against Spurs, Newcastle and Yeovil?

2244~~~
Correct. 

Plus the Evra stuff. Rafael's no winger. He shouldn't be expected to play like one.

2245~~~
Rafael has been quite poor for 2 seasons. This might be his last at United unless something changes.

2246~~~
I'm not sure what Evra has to do with it, there are examples of full backs who have made good wing backs too. I agree, an attacking full back can't necessarily translate that into the wing position but since I feel Valencia himself is massively lacking in the departments I would claim are generally at issue here it's not much I put huge stock into. Rafael is as likely to beat a man, as likely to put in a good ball, has better distribution; control and link-up play. Plus, he's better at defending.

That may not transpire to the pitch, but 2 halves of football in tough away games where the team has massively struggled in general is hardly fair in comparison to a player who has 12 (?) starts in the position, especially since there has been mistakes in defending and timidness in attack aplenty during those 12 games.

2247~~~
The big thing is that LVG will have seen little to impress him. I couldn't blame LVG for selling him at this point. Rafael has played excellently at times in his United career, but the manager must always go on what he sees. All LVG will see is an average RB who's injured more than he plays.

2248~~~
At this point, an honest assessment of how is playing now is probably more important than some idea of how promising he was (and not yet there) 2 years ago.

My concern is the basics. His passing lets him down too often, he is still not smart about when to hold and when to run, and he still has a rash tackle in him. In short he hasn't improved.

2249~~~
He wouldn't be the only struggling with Van Gaal's training regime this season [indeed LVG probably needs to find a better balance], January-May could be an important time in analysing


Does that nto run contrary to Van Gaal's remarks following the Yeovil match, and more importantly Rafael's form earlier in the season?

In any event, if the club were to sell him in the summer they'd only end up needing to buy two RBs, no?

2250~~~
I thought he just said he was impressed that Rafael managed to continue to play despite having a broken cheekbone? 

Besides Im not sure what good form Rafael has shown this season. He was decent against QPR, West Ham and Everton, poor against Leicester and otherwise very mediocre. None of them were close to his form circa 2012-13. I'm not sure those performances were nearly enough to prove his worth to a manager who relies so heavily on getting attacking width from his full backs.

Its true he'd need two RBs in the summer, but LVG still needs to think he can trust his back up right back.

2251~~~
that is it! if only he could fit in all himself

2252~~~
And Moyes training regime in 2013/14. And Fergie's training regime in three out of the four seasons before that one. Granted he was young when he joined us but he's been starting PL games since his debut season - 6 years ago - and only once managed to play more than 20 league games in a season. Average 16 league games/season. Less than one in two.

I would suggest the manager's training regime isn't the issue here.

2253~~~
except he wasn't, last season he was at least on par with all players(we can say the same about Van Persie and lots of others), he actually had a good standard imo, but the perception of him from last season is clouded with injuries and maybe one red card if I remember correctly which always gives people who don't rate him a lot of gun powder but he was quite consistent apart that and that can happen to everyone. Rooney, Smalling and other top players around the world are sent off for rush challenges...

..and the season before he was the best right back in the league on par with Zabaleta who eventually got into the EPL's best XI so what the hell are you talking about?

But maybe that is because perception of south american players in our team/league England overall is somehow stupid.. If he was English he would have been already taken as one of the best full backs in the world of football which he is when fit.. I think he is doing very well but needs this crucial thing in professional sport - luck for injuries. Hopefully he will have that because I can see people like you making him new Anderson...

2254~~~
Nah, the second half of 12/13 he was brilliant.

2255~~~
Exactly. If he didn't hesitate to sell a normally healthy Welbeck because of his record then he wouldn't/shouldn't have a problem selling Rafael based on his injury record

2256~~~
LVG needs to stop Varela signing permanently for RM. We need him back and im still pissed we let him leave.

2257~~~
Is this the same Guillermo Varela who has made a grand total of 8 league appearances in the Spanish second division?

Aye, we really dropped a bollock there.

2258~~~
I assumed by 2 seasons he meant this season and last season.

2259~~~
Fixed that for you.

2260~~~
Yes we did, because we're stuck with an injury prone player and a converted RWB. Also, Varela has made 13 appearances not 8. He's a great prospect. Looks a better defender than Rafael at the same age and he has stronger bones. In addition he has better positional sense, better timing of tackles and better crossing going forward. All he needed was to get a chance to show his worth in the first team.

2261~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2262~~~
You've always been a fan of his, if i remember correctly, the several games I've watched him in the reserves he's not made the same impression on me, compared to some other first team prospects over the years, I'm aware it's harder to judge a position such as fullback from the youth but I don't understand how you rate him so, so highly based on his gametime so far.

2263~~~
He adjusted to English football very quickly. The kid is clearly talented and I was impressed with his tenacity and his overall workrate. Definitely stood out for me. In fact, his game was very similar to Rafael's without the rash challenges. He's more talented than Blackett and McNair and those two have done well. I feel he has the mentality to handle being in the first team. 

Its a shame we got kicked out so early in the league cup because I think Janko is a good prospect as well who would've benefited from some first team action.

2264~~~
His first season he had a few injuries.
The season you mention was probably the 2010/2011  season which he had a good season(fewer injuries) however his injuries have been more consistent since then.
I like Rafael but he along with others fitness is a concern.

2265~~~
I was actually raving about this kid constantly last season. I remember I once said that he could go into first team straight away and no one would spot the difference as as you said he is very similar to Rafa with his playing style and good point with him not being too rush. He had got this calmness about him and maturity. It was only first few games he kinda struggled but since that he always was one of the best players on the pitch and the most solid, so it was really a shame that he didn't get a chance to impress in the first team especially when we had nothing to play for at the end of the last season and we let him go.

Remember that he played a couple of times as a left back and didn't do bad either as his balance always provide him good turn and he dribbled past players really easily. I didn't obviously see him this year but I think he has got better dribbling than Rafael and could be his natural successor but who knows who decides what will happen to some players. Sometimes it looks like we don't care about some youngsters. I can see us letting him go and Henriquez and maybe Keane. Obviously not every young palyer turn into world class or the class sufficient for our level but I think in this case Varela could come very handy if he stayed. Don't know what's he doing in la Castilla tbh..

I am sure he will turn out to be a great player whenever he ends up eventually.

2266~~~
I bet he will play in it as if it's given him super powers!

2267~~~
Great post. I agree with everything. Varela is a much better dribbler than Rafael (this part of Rafael's game is not every impressive tbh). He would've been the breakthrough kid this season if he stayed and was given a chance. IMO he's going to be better than Rafael. Real Madrid obviously wanted him as part of the Di Maria deal and we collapsed. Should've held on to him, because this 'loan' is really an audition for a permanent deal at Real.

2268~~~
Thought he could play with a mask on?

2269~~~
The philosophy precludes the use of masks; Van Gaal has already cancelled the club's charity masquerade ball.

2270~~~
It was not possible for me to follow the match in its entirety or the post-match proceedings, so further to <a class="username" data-user="51833, @Bojan11" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/51833/">@Bojan11</a>  's point, was Rafael's situation clarified at all afterwards? Is he incapable of playing football or is LVG being risk averse?

2271~~~
A training picture just uploaded by Herrera

<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/x_pFzevA9R/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

Feck knows what's going on here. Rafael has been training for weeks on end now, even before the injury in the FA cup game, and he hasn't even been seeing the bench, let alone the starting XI. Is he being frozen out?

2272~~~
People can't even use the 'philosophy' as an excuse - other players, like Blind, have come straight in after long injury lay offs.

LvG may not fancy Rafael, but he's a damn sight better than Valencia.

2273~~~
The strangest thing is he is our only actual RB too. So maybe LvG just wants to continue the 3-5-2? Claim Rafael lacks match rhythm and keep going with that dreaded formation? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2274~~~
Herrera was probably regaling them with tales of what it's like to actually make the bench as all 3 dream of what a start feels like.

The whole philosophy regarding players returning from injury has been exposed as nonsense in the last 2 games with Blind and Rojo coming straight back into the team and playing 90 minutes.

2275~~~
As much as I love Rafa, I think its understandable why any manager would avoid building a team with him as a starter. He's just too regularly injured for it to be worth the hassle.

2276~~~
time to brick it. never healthy , never got much better positionally.

2277~~~
If that's the case, the manager should rectify the issue by buying a proper right back.

Make no mistake though, playing Rafael is an infinitely better option than pissing around with 352.

2278~~~
LvG has a thing about playing injured players. If he doesn't think he can handle it, he won't play him. He's played Shaw a couple of times now with the strict guideline of taking him off after 60 minutes. He's done it numerous times this season, taking off players to prevent them from ending up with a knock. Now that he doesn't need to play Rafael, he doesn't have to take that chance and thus possibly waste a substitution.

2279~~~
Oh yeah, that makes no sense seeing as Blind and Rojo have come back at numerous times and played 90 minutes instantly. It's pretty contrary having these 'guidelines' that some are forced to adhere to and others aren't.

2280~~~
That is certainly one conclusion that one might draw, which is particularly unfortunately for those of us who haven't been converted to the philosophy. 

What would Fergie do? Call it overly simplistic perhaps, however he certainly wouldn't be wasting such a talent. Rafael has spent the majority of 2014/15 free from injury yet yo could be mistaken for thinking otherwise.

2281~~~
It's not overly simplistic at all.

Rafael is clearly a talented player. Our manager should be taking him and ironing out any perceived faults, not freezing him out.

This is one of a number of areas where LvG is fecking up.

2282~~~
Different kind of injuries, different players You need to be a lot more careful with a pulled hamstring or a groin strain than with a injured shoulder or rib. Herrera hurt his back. That's a type of injury that you don't want to become frequent. Rafael has always been very injury prone. That's not normal. You just want to throw him on the pitch again only to be injured again like usual? Last couple of times he got minutes he didn't come out clean.

2283~~~
Do you mean that utterly arbitrary substitution of Shaw whilst actually being one of our best players on the pitch?

This goes back to Nov/Dec, and like it or not he remains a better influence at RB than Valencia. If the debate centres around who should play RWB however, well then maybe Tony holds sway there.


Can you actually quantify the number of weeks this season for which injury has indisputably ruled him out of the matchday squad, or are you simply implying the above based upon hearsay and perception?

2284~~~
Yub. Part of the stubbornness. Decided before the game that Shaw should only play 60 minutes at the advice of his physio, doesn't sway from that conviction despite of performance.

2285~~~
^ We could just as well have hired a member of the Borg Collective, it wouldd intimidate the media just the same and march on regardless.

2286~~~
Why do you all keep using Blind as an example of coming straight from injury to playing? He was back in training for almost 3 weeks before making his first appearance and van Gaal has said he wasn't meant to play the full 90 but van Persie got injured and he had to.

2287~~~
No he's not. Valencia's been comfortably the better of the two this season.

Rafael may have been better two seasons ago but what manager picks his team based on form from two years before he took over?

2288~~~
And Rafael has been in 'training' for weeks on end too.

2289~~~
If I've interpreted LvG's statements correctly, he's playing 352 because he feels that it suits the likes of Valencia and Young better, which is fair enough. But Rafael is undoubtedly a preferable option for a four at the back system, which is what a number of us want to see.

I agree that Valencia's form has been pretty decent overall.

2290~~~
The form he demonstrated earlier on in the season (along with Di Maria) was far more beneficial to the team than anything we've seen from Valencia. The 3-5-2 does give Valencia an advantage over Rafael i would agree, should we continue to employ it, however so far as RBs go there is a marked difference in quality. 

Van Gaal ought to be deciding on a way by which to start them both.

2291~~~
Well if/when we play a back four and Rafael remains on the bench, that would be the time to complain. 

To be honest, though, Rafael's been so poor in his last couple of appearances (and Valencia so solid) I'm not sure I agree with that either. Would certainly not be picking on form.

2292~~~
Maybe at RB but I guess not at RWB, which is where LvG clearly wants a player for.  Valencia must be showing more in training.

2293~~~
He was back in training for a couple weeks and then got to play where he injured himself again and is back out. Valencia has also been good this season so there is no need to rush Rafael. The fact is Rafael isn't slaving away at training for weeks while Blind is hoping out of the physio room and straight onto the pitch. He also trained for nearly 3 weeks before playing. Thus, keeping with the philosophy.

2294~~~
You make a fair point on Valencia's individual form. Don't see why LvG doesn't just play him at right back. Sure, he may get occasionally caught out positionally, but he's a pretty diligent player overall and playing a system that the majority of our team are comfortable in would mitigate any discomfort Valencia might feel.

I just think LvG has used his 'lack' of full backs to persist with the 352, which has been rotten in terms of creativity.

2295~~~
That post is, with perhaps the exception of describing Valencia as good (relatively speaking mind you), quite awash with falsehoods. From the number of weeks you say he spent training to the his status of being out injured now.

If the summit of LVG's present ambition is to use solely Valencia down the right flank, well that speaks for itself IMO.

2296~~~
I don't like Valencia either, never have, but he has been quite good lately and there is no denying that. Number of weeks in training for who? Rafael or Blind? Because Blind was in training for 2.5 weeks before playing. For Rafael I said a couple, so 2-3 weeks w.e it is similar to Blind. 

Whether van Gaal's ambition is to use Valencia or not isn't really to do with my initial point anyway. van Gaal is being criticized for supposedly favouring Blind because he has come straight back from injury which he hasn't. He trained for 2.5 weeks before playing and van Gaal has said he wasn't meant to play the full 90. Exactly in accordance with his philosophy.

2297~~~
That's what I thought until Rafael and Shaw both started against Yeovil, in a 352.

2298~~~
True.

Perhaps he doesn't trust any combination of our defenders in a four.

It's just a bemusing situation to me. I'd much prefer being more open at the back but carrying a proper attacking threat.

The solution seems so obvious to me - 4231 with Blind and Carrick protecting the back line.

2299~~~
Absolutely. 100% agree. Bugs the shit out of me that Van Gaal evidently feels differently.

I think he's right in persisting with Valencia ahead of Rafael though. He's really getting to grips with his new role and has been very consistent. Rafael's been very hit and miss for one and a half seasons now.

2300~~~
Yeah, that was usually my thought but then if you're clutching at straws you could say it was only yeovil with both McNair and blackett in so he didn't mind shoe horning them in a 3-5-2... Also young and valencia have been amongst our better and most consistent players to be fair this season.

2301~~~
So far as we can be aware, and this would include the modest 2/3 day period in which he didn't train following the cheekbone injury, Rafael has spent much of the past 6-8 weeks (if not more) absent from the team in spite of fitness. 

The Blind comparison doesn't bother me in isolation, what conclusions we might draw regarding the side's formation, do. As does his general policy so far as injured players go, is his philosophy in that area even producing better outcome for the squad?

2302~~~
No he hasn't. He was on the bench on Dec. 20, played on the 26th, 28th, Jan. 1st and 4th when he got injured. Hardly absent from the team for the past 6-8 weeks. Some of those appearances came off the bench but van Gaal simply may prefer Valencia and be rewarding Valencia for his good displays. 

Whether his injury philosophy is benefiting the side, I don't know, nobody can really know, but it is besides my point. People are complaining Rafael is being forced to sit out longer after injuries than Blind which simply isn't true. They both had to train for 2-3 weeks before playing, keeping with van Gaal's philosophy. Whether Rafael can't break into the first XI once back has nothing to do with the injury philosophy but to do with van Gaal seeing Valencia as a better choice.

2303~~~
Your case is that of 115 minutes of football, none of it as RB, for a player who began training in third week of November if memory serves. Considering the possible opportunities for game time and starts in that period, "much of the past 6-8 weeks" does indeed sound like a fair description. He could be starting now too, i suspect that Fergie would have done so under the circumstances. 

And as for rewarding Valencia, do we do so at the expense of what is best for the team? Simply because Young and or Valencia have had an Indian summer f sorts, albeit the latter to a noticeably  lesser degree, doesn't mean that you build a team around them. United surely aims for the best that it can be, not merely...solid.

2304~~~
Christ, man. He's not "building a team round" Valencia. He's picking him ahead of a player who's been worse than him so far this season. It's not even as though this is one of those occasions where we're having to trust the managers judgement about players he's seeing in training when we're not. We're seeing it on the pitch. Valencia's been playing well. Rafael has not. 

I'm glad you've backed down on this weird conspiracy theory about Van Gaal treating injured players differently (without manning up and actually saying so) but you're making the selection decision at fullback/wingback far more complicated than it needs to be. Van Gaal has two options and has picked the form player. That's really all there is to it. Rafael did get picked ahead of Valencia earlier in the season (I think?) but he's not been playing well and is further down the pecking order right now. Justifiably so.

2305~~~
I've never made such a claim, neither do i believe it to be so. For as long as Van Gaal continues to prefer the 3-5-2, Valencia will have an edge over Rafael. Many of us would argue against the formation's use in the first place however, in which case the team could benefit from both players.

2306~~~
Apologies. I thought you had come up with the injury stuff <a class="username" data-user="69130, @limerickcitykid" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69130/">@limerickcitykid</a> was debating. 

I'm with you on the formation thing. Just not sure that Rafael (on the form of the last season and a half) would be part of our best XI in any formation.

2307~~~
With his "recent" dip in form I started to wonder if Fabio's departure could've been connected with this. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2308~~~
Great player on his day, but we need someone who is available more than half the season.

2309~~~
I don't think the 3-5-2 is isolated to just protecting our wingbacks. We started that game with McNair and Blackett too who Van Gaal clearly doesn't trust and I honestly think won't be here next season.

2310~~~
I would consider that to be rather harsh treatment, particularly with regard to McNair. And if Van Gaal intends to part company with one or more of the club's elder CBs, he may as well see how they develop over another season.

2311~~~
I've explained why in other threads but I'll explain my reasons here:

Firstly, I don't think either has ever been particularly highly regarded by the club. I think they were drafted in during an "unexpected" (by Van Gaal anyway) injury crisis where we have had constant simultaniously injuries to Smalling, Jones, Evans and Rojo leaving us severely depleted.

I think as the situation stands, they are both aware that we will not be in that position next season as we will reinforce both the centreback and fullback positions meaning more competition for less spots (2CBs rather than 3CB system).

That means that the contract they will be signing will essentially be one that ties them to the club for the next X years where they will be loaned out. It's unlikely the club will be making any sort of competitive financial offer for two players who they intend to loan when the club stands to get compensated if they leave on a free while they will both get more competitive wage offers from lesser clubs in a more important squad role.

Also, if they did choose to stay here and go on loan for a season or two, by the time they come back to compete for a first team spot they're going to be facing competition from the highly regarded Fosu-Mensah, Taunzebe and/or Borthwick-Jackson.

They've done well this season but I don't think the club owes them any sort of contract for filling in where needed. I think they can be grateful for how much it enhanced their profile and the experience it has given them. I think they will both get Premiership moves to mid table clubs.

2312~~~
So is he fit or injured again. No idea why he didn't start against QPR. Need's to be played into form IMO.

2313~~~
He's got a fractured cheekbone which won't have healed yet and so wasn't risked.

2314~~~
Does it matter? Valencia was starting ahead of him even when Rafael was fit.

2315~~~
I think that's because he didn't look too sharp when he came back from injury, but he should have started against QPR.

2316~~~
When Rafael is all patched up and is deemed fit for duty, I don't see why he can't do well as wingback.  First, he's a better defender than Valencia; and second, his attacking play isn't shabby at all.  There may not be a lot of daylight between the two overall (Valencia better attacking, Rafael better defending), but I don't see why Rafael should be ruled out as a wingback.

That said, I'd like to rule out the 352/532 altogether when Rafael anad Shaw are both fit and in form.

2317~~~
Not for the last 1.5 seasons

2318~~~
Nonsense. He's a better defender than Valencia, there's no debate there. Valencia has played well at wingback as he's found a balance between attack and defend that came quite natural to the pragmatic winger he is. As far as defending goes and the right back position Rafael is better.

2319~~~
I don't think I agree and will stick to my "nonsense". Valencia has been very good in his defensive duties this season, even if he's not been great going forward. Rafael might be the better defender overall, but thats definitely not been the case this season. He's been prone to making lapses

2320~~~
This is where the problem lies.

I know it's a little harsh with the current injury since it's a facial one that was unavoidable, but the fact is he will be injured again after a short run of games.

2321~~~
He's got very little to do defensively with a spare centreback always covering his flank. It's night and day from the job Rafael has to do when we play a back four, something Valencia isn't trusted to do very often. 

The last 25 minutes against QPR being the first time since the City game.

2322~~~
Didn't stop Rafael being repeatedly rinsed by lower league opposition the last time he played at wingback.

2323~~~
You could argue that one of the reasons why LVG is reluctant to play a back 4 is because he does not trust Rafael enough to do a solid defensive job at right back. While Rafa has some good defensive qualities, he is prone to the occasional brain-fart.

2324~~~
His problem in that game was going forward, "getting rinsed" defensively is a gross exaggeration. 

Can you remember his last brain fart?

2325~~~
Last few games:
1) Yeovil - defensively suspect throughout the game
2) Stoke - didnt play much
3) Spurs - More than 1 mistake made by Rafa in that appearance
4) Newcastle - didnt play much, didnt play well either
5) Chelsea - got a plain needless yellow in the first half. Did well after that
6) West Brom - People blamed him and Jones for the second goal, I think he did fine in the game

2326~~~
Yes, it's an exaggeration but Yeovil were really really crap going forwards yet the only joy they did get in the first half came exclusively down our right flank.

2327~~~
I asked for his last brain fart, a specific incident where he does something stupid or rash which leads to a clear cut chance. 

None against Yeovil, none against Stoke, none against Spurs, none against Newcastle, none against Chelsea and that West Brom goals was completely Jones' fault as Rafael is wide holding the offside trap and marking his man on the wing while Jones was completely out of position at let his man through with acres to run into. The only reason it looks like Rafael's fault is because he reacted quickest in chasing him back. 

So, no "brain farts" that you accused him of. I'm not saying he was above a 7/10 performance in every game but there were none of these "brain farts" you accused him of. He hasn't had one for a long long time.

2328~~~
Your point is fair enough- maybe I shouldn't call it brain fart, but rather being-off defensively. Its just that his defensive contributions are nowhere near the 2012-13 level. In 2012-13, I just remember a couple of games when he was poor defensively - and one where it was not even his problem, just that he was taken off by SAF before half time for lack of height. He has just not been the same this year, unfortunately.

Btw, I would call the Chelsea yellow stupid. Not a brain-fart, as you've pointed out, but stupid nevertheless <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2329~~~
His problem is that he's too injury prone and has been since the day he joined. Players that are in and out of the team never show their true potential, and whenever Rafa went for extended periods without injury he was fantastic.

2330~~~
Didn't he get a pen called against Leicester for needlessly shoving the opponent in the box?  I remember it was pretty controversial but it's one of those things where a cooler head would have served him.  If I recall that was their first goal when we were up 3-0 and gave them life.

2331~~~
Yep. It was controversial and was probably largely influenced by both his reputation as a hot-head and the way he carries himself on the pitch. Another player might not have had it given against them.

Still, LvG criticised him for it after the game so it's fair to class it as a mistake, even if people here think it shouldn't have been a penalty....

2332~~~
He wasn't holding the offside trap, he was a yard behind everyone and kept Berahino onside. There is no way he wasn't at fault there.

2333~~~
We really need him back

2334~~~
Hope he is fit for Leicester

2335~~~
Was he on the bench? Can only think he was injured as to why Valencia lasted 93 minutes on the pitch tonight.

2336~~~
This match was begging for him to come on. Valencia was brainless and wasted so many opportunities to open them up on the flanks, which looked like our only way through all match

2337~~~
Rafael is close to being finished at United

2338~~~
Remember when he used to overlap with a winger and put someone on the back foot. How I'd love to see that back. Same with Evra.

2339~~~
As i understand matters we had two fit fullbacks available yesterday, and this even  by Van Gaal's high standards, however chose to leave both of them on the bench. Just super.

2340~~~
Will look a weaker player if we don't have a winger in front of him who he can link with.

2341~~~
I'd love to see either januzaj or di maria in front of him on the wing. Hell, even Valencia would be OK, they've linked up well in the past. Just no more Valencia as RB.

2342~~~
Would love to play Shaw and Rafa more. They make a huge difference, several times today when Januzaj or whoever was wide got the ball, Blind(not as bad) or Valencia never overlapped so it was always 1vs2, but when Shaw came on Januzaj had a couple 1vs1 and beat his man and whipped in a couple crosses, or took the player on. It makes such a big difference having overlapping fullbacks to take a player away, not only does it give the winger more space, but it opens up the middle of the pitch a bit more too.

2343~~~
Not on the bench again today. Picked up another injury? If not, it's quite clear he's being frozen out.

2344~~~
Very upset if Rafa is being frozen out. The one player whose desire you could never, ever doubt.

2345~~~
He's finished at United I think. It is a shame because he is one of my favourites. Even if he isn't being frozen out that means it is <i>another </i>injury. Surely LvG won't want someone who can't get fit.

2346~~~
If you're betting on it, then the smart bet is we're replacing him in the summer. Just hope it isn't Dani Alves.

2347~~~
He could be injured.

2348~~~
I can't really say how I know this, and it's not really massive news but I have it on good authority that he is very worried about his future at the club. He loves it here but he reckons he might get sold in June.

2349~~~
If he is fit, and we have no information to the contrary, the decision to exclude him from the bench (let alone the team) bodes ill for not only Rafael's future but how Van Gaal might go about managing the RB role long term.

2350~~~
I think he has every reason to be worried, tbh.

2351~~~
It's not like there are a lot of good right-backs out there. Signing competition for him is great, but selling him would be mad.

2352~~~
Well that's not true at all. There are two in the Premier League alone that are on the same level as Rafael and probably attainable in the summer. He shouldn't be frozen out, as he's comfortably better than Valencia, but his injury record makes him far too unreliable.

2353~~~
Indeed, for assuming that LVG actually attains Champions League football the emphasis should be on expanding his resources.

2354~~~
If the reports linking us to Clyne or Coleman were true then there was always going to be slim chance of him being first choice here next season.

As is though it wouldn't be surprising if he isn't here at all.

2355~~~
I collect that you are referring to Clyne and Coleman? Let's say that United does buy one of them but sells Rafael, has the depth of the squad been advanced to any significant degree? The moment injury strikes the team will be as vulnerable as it is now Louis' whims.

I hope he is injured. Probably the biggest insult you can make against a footballer is picking Valencia ahead of him! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2357~~~
I can understand why LVG prefers Valencia because he is more tactically/positionally disciplined.

However, I hope Rafa gets a run out in the next match against Cambridge (?) because his form in 2012-2013 was amazing. There is no reason why he cant recreate it with an injury free run in the team.

2358~~~
Yes, I'm referring to those two. It hasn't necessarily advanced, but the difference is, we would actually have a mainstay right back who is capable of playing over the duration of ten-plus games while maintaining a high standard. Not even Rafael is capable of that due to the incessant injuries that always occur with him.

2359~~~
If lvg is freezing him out then im ok with it, I like rafa but his time is up now, he seems to be made of glass and we can't rely on him, Clyne or Coleman would be the way forward with rafa as back up.

2360~~~
Didn't know 2 were a lot and those 2 are among the few good right-backs I counted, apart from that there aren't many out there. Also like <a class="username" data-user="8698, @Nick 0208 Ldn" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8698/">@Nick 0208 Ldn</a> said getting rid of Rafael wouldn't do any good for our squad depth.

2361~~~
I noted two in the Premier League. There are more abroad aswell. I agree that it wouldn't do our squad depth any good and I'm not advocating it, but it's not something that would overly concern me if we were to sell Rafael opposed to Valencia. The latter makes just as many appearances at rightback as Rafael does anyway, even if they aren't on the same level when Rafael is at his peak.

We laugh at how decimated our defence always is, but the rightback we inevitably sign will be bought under the impression they will be a mainstay of the first team and that's what you would expect from Coleman, Clyne, Darmian, etc.

2362~~~
Valencia got his place just because Rafa was injured when he came back we played 3-5-2 which doesn't suit him that much.. I don't think he will be sold. He has the future here but needs to get his fittnes back and with his hardworking approach and more talent will get over Valencia once again

2363~~~
He definitely will be sold in the summer. He's an outstanding attacker but he is a headless chicken as a defender. There's no way he will still be here after the summer

2364~~~
If he isn't fit enough to be first choice then he won't be fit enough to be relied on as a back-up either. He is a good player but if he is going to be injured over half the time then there is no point having him.

2365~~~
I believe we've been here before. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> This has a good deal more to do with Van Gaal's personal preference than fitness. Valencia did have the added advantage of being the incumbent in a 3-5-2, however a couple of minor injuries wouldn't appear to be sufficient explanation for just seven starts in all competitions. There was no mention of any problem on Friday and was thought fit enough for the bench last week if i recall.   

To Rafael it amounts to the same of course, without a change in circumstances there is a decision awaiting both club and player in the summer.

2366~~~
Would be happy to see him sold. Can't remember the last time he was fit long enough to rediscover his form from years ago.
We can't rely on him so why not get rid. Been sat on the bench wouldn't do him any favours.
Plenty of better RB out there who can play more games a season. Valencia can cover if needed.

2367~~~
I miss him. I hope he isn't being frozen out.

2368~~~
He wont be here next season.

2369~~~
Good player when he's fit but Clyne or Coleman would be an upgrade on him, tbh. Clyne also will only have 12 months left on his contract this summer.

2370~~~
I would hate to see Rafael get fit and start performing for another club. Plus I do not think Coleman or Clyne have ever performed as well as Rafael did in the 12-13 season.

2371~~~
Well you don't have to worry then.

2372~~~
Same could be said about Herrera... Not getting much time under LVG..  No one knows what that dutch maniac is doing.

2373~~~
Yeah I agree with that. Love the feisty little fella but his time is up. I think we will sign a quality rightback and Valencia will survive the cull again and stay as backup.

2374~~~
Criminal how he is being overlooked.

2375~~~
I love him as much as anyone and pretty much abhor Valencia but the fact is that Valencia is always fit to play and provides selection consistency. He's not doing a bad job truth be told. I think Rafael's days are very much numbered.

2376~~~
Regrettably, Van Gaal's policies seem to diminish the ingenuity that might otherwise be brought to bear, either through the demotion of players or his tactics.

2377~~~
It's not a dig at Valencia, I'm one of his few fans but when Rafael is fit, he is better than Valencia, there is no hiding from that so unless there is recruitment in that area, we should play our best available option there, which is Rafael.

2378~~~
Not fussy. He's rash as. Good going forward but you just don't trust him at the back. He seems like a good footballer though, I reckon if he'd had more time at United in the reserves he's of ended up possibly as a midfielder.

I wonder where he'll go in the summer. Can't see many PL teams taking him, possibly off to Spain?

2379~~~
If he was available for selection today it is really worrying for his future. Paddy McNair was selected as the reserve right back ahead of him. Much like Van Gaal failing to use Herrera and picking Jones over Smalling his reluctance to use Rafael is extremely odd.

2380~~~
Yeah that was just odd. He must be injured then? Because McNair as a RB is clearly nowhere near Rafael's level.

2381~~~
Injured again or not injured. Valencia has a bigger chance to be our RB back-up next season than Rafael.

2382~~~
LVG said post-match that he does not consider Valencia to be a right full-back but selected him on this occasion because we were at home and he wanted to attack. He said Valencia and Young work better in a 3-5-2 but Shaw, for example, works better in a conventional back four.

Rafael is probably the only player in the squad who meets Van Gaal's definition of being a right-back so hopefully has a chance to get games, although Valencia is clearly valued and has given us continuity so it might be difficult.

2383~~~
McNair can cover CB,RB as well as DM.

2384~~~
Arguable. He hasn't shown enough to convince me he should be covering anywhere but CB, and even then I would try to avoid that because he hasn't looked overly impressive IMO.

2385~~~
I think he's clearly gone if we can find a buyer. 

If he's not getting games because he's not being picked - he's a goner. 
If he's not getting games because he is always injured - he's clearly a goner. 

Either way he's not playing and we need a right back and a backup who is available.

2386~~~
I hope so. That fractured cheekbone is unlikely to have healed yet. Hopefully that is why he is out.

But, if Rafa is fit and if Van Gaal has decided Rafa is out in the summer and McNair will stay then at least he is building for the future. I criticised Moyes for not doing so last season so I shouldn't criticise Van Gaal this season . . . . . but I will because it's a stupid decision!

2387~~~
Smalling and Fellaini were on the bench. That was enough cover for centre back and holding midfield to have at least one specialist full back on the bench.

2388~~~
I'm distraught at the idea of Rafael leaving the club.

2389~~~
Are we to judge him by his words or his deeds? Not only do they fail to adequately  explain Rafael's absence from the match-day squad, but moreover can only renew concerns about the 3-5-2. With Young's return fast approaching the pieces would fall nicely into place for Louis.

2390~~~
Apparently behind Mcnair in the pecking order as well now <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

2391~~~
Was obviously not going to be in the squad after he played yesterday. Hopefully he's back on Sunday.

2392~~~
Is he injured?

2393~~~
Played for the U21s just last night.

2394~~~
He was injured, said he had to weak a mask because of the broken cheekbone but it would make it hard to see. Played in the reserves yesterday so should be back soon.

2395~~~
A detail which didn't prevent his inclusion on the bench  in the earlier fixture.

2396~~~
We need a proper right back. Badly.

2397~~~
Whom would you suggest?

2398~~~
He would be like a new signing <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

2399~~~
Completely agree. Probably my favourite player when he's fit and in form, we are undoubtedly a better side with him on the right. Really hope this is a case of easing him back from injury but I am worried.

2400~~~
To be fair to Van Gaal he can't make decisisons based on form from previous seasons. Rafael has not been good this season, so you can see why he's not rated by the manager.

That said, I thought he was good for the reserves the other night so hopefully that's being fed back and might influence his next team selection. Although Fulham's opener did come from a winger getting to the byline down his flank. Which will have blotted his copybook.

2401~~~
As a rule? Because neither has be been particularly bad, both to my recollection and going by the ratings on WhoSocred. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Players/4092" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.whoscored.com/Players/4092</a>

The respective traits of our two right-backs are the determining factor i feel. Rafael is a fullback who lives up to the ideals of the Fergie era; he can at times be a rather frenetic force on the pitch, but this contributes to a generally energised style of play and more threatening attack. Tony on the other hand is steady and predictable, very handy in a crisis but limiting offensively.

2402~~~
If you want to talk about "ideals of an era" you'd have to include Wes Brown in your equation. Not to mention the fact that Fergie frequently picked the likes of Smalling and Jones ahead of Rafael. 

I think you're looking for significance that isn't there. Rafael is not having a great season (following on from a not great season in 2013/14). If/when he starts playing better he'll start more games.

2403~~~
I'd say it's nailed on that you sign one in the summer.

2404~~~
Normally find myself agreeing with most of what you say but I disagree with you here. He's started 6 league games and that coincided with the best attacking football we have played all season IMO (am talking about our form in September/October). Although the likes of Di Maria/Herrera were a reason for that good form, I firmly believe with Rafael in the XI we are a much bigger force going forward. He was also solid defensively in that run with the exception of the mishap between him and Jones vs West Brom. Notable performance vs QPR, West Ham (man of the match), Everton & Chelsea.

Admittedly he has been slow coming back from this injury and looked poor at Yeovil - but then again the whole back 5 did in that system.

2405~~~
No doubting his ability.

He just can't be relied upon to string 10 games together.

Sell him (as much as I like him) and buy Clyne.

Or just keep him as a squad player.

2406~~~
got to agree with this.

I worked it out elsewhere (when i was in the newbies i think) that he makes on average 17 apperances per year.  He'l complete 90 minutes in about half of them.....lets say 10.  So he averages 90 minutes 10 times per season - regardless of his qaulity - thats not good enough.  He could be Irwin, Nevill and Evra rolled into one and with that injury record id want him replacing

I wouldnt get rid......but i would buy a fiurst choice right back.  Number 1 priority for me

2407~~~
All players are based on previous seasons. Why else would Rooney be made captain and people still label him world class? The same people claim that Rafael is error prone, but he is no more so than most other quality fullbacks. 

Rafael brings dynamism and flair down that right side, something we've been missing of late. Valencia has done well, but Rafael is a step up in quality.

2408~~~
Pretty much agree, although I'd keep him as backup rather than sell him. Also, I'm unsure I'd target Clyne, think we can get a better player somewhere for the price he'd cost.

2409~~~
If we're going to bring in a new RB, bring in someone better than Rafael, not Clyne or Coleman.

2410~~~
At that point though you'd have to wonder who LVG would prefer to keep as back up to our new RB. Injury prone Rafael or reliable machine Valencia? If we're looking at the two of them purely as back up/squad players then there's a strong argument for favouring the guy who is always fit and can play in more than one role.....

2411~~~
If we are going to buy a RB, personally I'd prefer Coleman to Clyne.

2412~~~
Did you go right back to his debut season or something?

For the seasons' 2012/13 and 2013/14, Rafael's average number of appearances is a respectable <b>32</b>.

And he has spent many weeks of this season free from injury as well, Valencia is simply being preferred in the role for a debatable range of reasons.

2413~~~
Who is better than those 3 and attainable?

2414~~~
McNair seems a dark horse for the right back role, got some great pace on him.

2415~~~
I don't think he would be that much, sure his contract is up next year.

Then again we paid nearly 20 million for Young who was in a similar contract situation!

2416~~~
He doesn't have pace. He's average speedwise.

2417~~~
People are getting carried away because of how fast Chadwick and Taylor made him look. They make Fletch look like Usain.

2418~~~
He can dribble a day pass and doesn't shot his pants when pressed . He also links up well with his right sided midfielder which is something Valencia is not good at besides a back or side pass. 

Basically Rafael makes his side of the pitch that much better. It is very obvious we are better going forward with him I  the side.

The rest of the season  will be very interesting. Basically make or break for him. Valencia has been great defensively and doesn't deserve to be dropped so things don't look good for Rafael right now. 

He has so many fans because he mixes skill with passion and urgency. Since 2011 we have lacked so much urgency it has been embarrassing at times.

2419~~~
yes, Rafael plays with passion and urgency whenever he is on the pitch. He doesn't hold back and is always on the move.  Too bad, he just cant stay healthy for long.

2420~~~
Too right.

It was only Cambridge too.

2421~~~
Over the past few years, both have been better than Rafael - no questions about that. what's to say he is ever going to be fit long enough to rediscover his form from a long time ago? We need to make progress.

2422~~~
Whats up with hin,injured or?

2423~~~
Played 90 minutes for the reserves on Monday. Said he was happy to get 90 minutes under his belt and hopes to now get into the first team and that he was glad he doesn't need the mask now as it caused some problems with seeing.

2424~~~
I miss him. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Hope he will be back soon and stay injury free, although that is much to ask for. Was brilliant in 12/13, the dedication he shows on the pitch is something else.

2425~~~
Bizarre comments. Rafael "not good this season", "poor at Yeovil". When Rafael has played this season he has been excellent (he played injured vs Yeovil). He is the best right back at the club by a long long way. Replacing him with Coleman or Clyne would be an expensive move for limited if any improvement.

Apart from injuries, his lack of height is the only reason I can see for him being left out of the side. United as a team are very weak in the air.

2426~~~
I agree with the most bu he is good in the air, he has got problem in he box to win some challenges but which right back hasn't. He is very good at the line to win the "ordinary" aerial duels. He's got good spring. Anyway he is the best right in the club by a mile and one good game by McNair against the fourt league club at Old Trafford where we are dominating games anyone this season will no change it.. Just need more luck with injuries.

And I don't think there is any immediate need to purchase right back, we have got Valencia who is about good and McNair showing some quality there as well but still long way for him( to prove himself in bigger games). Rafael has been realy good whenever he played even straight after neverending injury problems... We have got to spend elsewhere - attack,wingers, centerback possibly and defensive centre half

2427~~~
Desperately need a right back.

2428~~~
You sound blinded by sentimentality. Excellent you say? Rafael has been poor this season overall. His best two performances were against West Ham and Everton (both home games). He wasn't bothered against QPR when we beat them 4-0 as they were horrendous.  I wouldn't say he's been excellent. Coleman or Clyne would represent a lot of improvement because first of all they will be available to play as they have better fitness records. Rafael is not much better than those two.

2429~~~
Not in the squad again. He's gone.

2430~~~
McNair preferred as the back-up RB. It seems that Rafael's U-21 appearance was more indicative of his status than any sort of prep for the weekend.

2431~~~
I think he's done. I like Rafael, and I think he's still our best RB (though I think we should upgrade anyway) but I don't think LVG rates him at all. Wonder where he'd end up, should he leave in the summer.

2432~~~
Shame but it looks like curtains for Raf. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2433~~~
In terms of injury record and moments of madness during games.....the negatives outweigh the positives with Rafael and he will be gone in the summer

2434~~~
On here when a player isn't in the squad it automatically means that the player is gone.

It was Januzaj a month or two ago and look he's forced his way into the side.

2435~~~
I hope its tactical. WHU are a tall team....maybe just maybe Van Gaal wants some height.

2436~~~
There are a few big differences between the two though.

2437~~~
With the exception of the fractured cheekbone, all that he's sustained are two fairly minor injuries. What moments of madness in can you recall in the last year or two?

2438~~~
Highly doubt it. Valencia is hardly great in the air and we're not starting Fellaini.

2439~~~
I think its more down to the fact that theres no point building a team with Rafa as a main player, as he'll just break down injured in a week or two.

Its a massive shame, but I doubt he'll be here after the Summer.

2440~~~
Fully fit squad.  Tough road game.  Valencia appears to be first choice RB.

2441~~~
I know he's injury prone but I still wish he'd play when fit, until we can get a proper solution at RB.

2442~~~
From the Fulham match report earlier this week:

2443~~~
Not at all. I thought he was fantastic in that QPR home game. With Herrera on the right of the diamond he was left completely alone without support on the right yet was a threat throughout.

He's better than Valencia both defensively and offensively and is the best right back at the club by a long way. Just my opinion obviously. Maybe it is sentimentality but if so that is just because I think he is a very good player.

He's been criticised on here for his performances at Leicester and West Brom. I thought he played well in both games. He hasn't played enough but when he has he has played very well.

2444~~~
<b>I</b> would have looked fantastic in that QPR game. Amazing the way United players are still being talked up based on their displays in that game. Probably the worst PL opposition we've had at OT in several years.

2445~~~
This is all really stupid, since when people start to confuse injured with poor? He was certainly above average this season, better than Rooney, RVP or Falcao, better than McNair also and on par with Valencia who looks dependable in terms of injuries.. There is no way Rafael was poor this season, it's like with the last season when he was just about good and one of our better players but overall we were poor so when people picking up player to blame it has to be some south american because we had so many better homegrown players who are for some people more likeable. 

Clyne would have been option as he can paly on both flanks but he is no way better than Rafael in full fitness tho, Coleman had his rocket season last year. Nothing special this year.

Injured = NOT Poor, get it people.. some people have got short memories and only remember mistakes to criticize a player. It's ridiculous sometimes

2446~~~
I only mentioned that game because it was specifically mentioned in the post I quoted. Anyone who judges a player who has been at the club as long as Rafael based on one game is an idiot.

2447~~~
I thought Hull this season took the biscuit... they took feeble to a whole new level.

2448~~~
Anyone else think moving Valencia into RCM and Rafael back to RB could solve a lot of our problems? More steel in midfield and a bit more invention out wide. Weird the way their roles have reversed from a traditional winger/fullback archetype but they've always linked up well and would complement each other very well if we lined up like that IMO.

2449~~~
I actually think back to Valencia's game at RCM a lot. It was against Everton, and he wasn't bad at all. It's definitely an option, particularly in away games where we need pace and physicality. Allows us to use Rooney further forward too. The only issue is Valencia's has no left foot and his passing range is very weak.

2450~~~
But then there have been ralatively few instances in which we've gone toe-tote-toe with a team who were performing near their potential (little different from the Hull/Newcastle matches being cited as supporting evidence for a player). If Van Gaal so wished, Rafael could bring far more to the party than does Valencia in attacking sense, regrettably that would not appear to be an important requirement.

A better albeit less flamboyant example of the Rafael of 2015, might be the Chelsea match. Not only did it exemplify his maturity, but yet again proved the lie to the accusation that he is still rash. Even with an early yellow card he successfully nullified the threat posed by Hazard for much of the game. Our manager should be aspiring to field the best fullback at the club, not settling for mere reliability. Let's say that Young does well whilst Shaw serves his ban, ought the manager to discard the pecking order yet again?

2451~~~
I'm sure the manager would argue he <i>is</i> fielding the best fullback at the club. Hopefully Rafael can convince him otherwise. He's got all day, every day, on the training pitch to do exactly that.

Slightly strange you use a game where he picked up an early, silly booking as evidence he is no longer rash. I'd say it's evidence of the exact opposite, no matter how succesfully he walked the disciplinary tightrope he put himself on.

2452~~~
If he remained the immature and rash player which some here accuse him of being, he'd have done a Chris Smalling or come close to it, neither of which occurred. Many of Rafael's counterparts at RB will pick up "silly" yellows from time to time, only the perception is quite different; Zabaletta and Clyne have been booked 8 and 5 times respectively to name but two.

2453~~~
IMO we should let him go or let him battle it out for a spot with a new proper RB. He'll probably lose that battle because of his injury record. He's been a sicknote since we signed him as an 18 year old. His brother Fabio was too. What makes us think that he'll suddenly become a dependable first team player? He's 25 this year

2454~~~
Stupid? Really? Yes, poor <i>overall</i>. Can you read? Im sorry I don't share your opinions. Actually im not. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>. Rafael is a very good player at full fitness, but he won't even usurp Valencia because his fitness record is terrible and Valencia has done a fine job at RB this season. This summer whether you like it or not Rafael will be properly replaced. I bet on it. You must be joking saying Rafa has been better than Rooney, McNair and RVP.

2455~~~
Because Rafael has been such already, during the club's last title winning season. Moreover, his injury record since 2012 isn't actually as bad as his detractors would have people believe. 

That LVG would in this regard cut his nose off to spite his face (as he's doing with Herrera), shouldn't diminish the potential which is spurning.

2456~~~
He hasn't played consistently enough for someone who is a first choice RB, actually the only proper RB we have. Rafael has only ever played more than 30 games in one season. Thats not dependable. Compare that to other fullbacks we've had like Irwin, Evra and Neville

2457~~~
His average over the previous two seasons is 32, even with injury and Mouyes' mismanagement. And more topically his absences this season have had more to do with Van Gaal's policies than prolonged injury.

2458~~~
He played 40 games in 2012/13, an insane number of games for him. That drove up his average. His second highest in one season is 28 (managed this twice) in a CL season. These are not numbers of a dependable first choice player in a key position. Van Gaal's policies have nothing to do with his absences. Rafael was played as a RWB in preseason, so LVG definitely thought he could play in his system. It's Rafael's injury record that has seen him out even when he regains fitness because Valencia has done very well and doesn't deserve to be dropped. Fergie and Moyes both played Smalling and Jones as a RB in some games when Rafael was fit also. We need to move on to better things IMO.

2459~~~
It's a shame to say it but I agree.. at 25 he should be 100% a starting player, especially with the quality (if not the quantity) of experience he has built up in that time. A settled defence is the bedrock of any team, it's time we start looking for a proper replacement.

2460~~~
One of my favourite players at the club. Really hope he can turn it around and make himself first choice but, unfortunately, I can't see it.

2461~~~
The trend of appearances has been a generally positive direction however. 

Valencia has done well enough, although this should be placed in the context of his manager's modest expectations offensively. Should he be considered as a permanent RB next year, the balance of the team's attack would fall off a cliff at the first sight of injury to Rafael's successor.

2462~~~
RVP has been maybe the worst player in our squad this year, can't score goals can't do anything for the team, always put in lazy performance, apart maybe three games he was shocking. Can't see why you defend him Rooney had really poor start to the season then he got great 5,6 games as CAM and now he plays like the worst player just because he has got armband.. Is it his fault that he doesn't play in his best position? No Is it the Rafael's fault palying out of position as wingback?

Yes, short memory and people's assumption that if players does play not too many games due to injury that he is bad. I don't think you rate him fairly. If he was to get marks for how he played he would have had better average score than rooney or RVP. Valencia is just about solid but not the level we should aspire so maybe if van Gaal doesn't rate rafael we will buy someone. McNair had so many shaky performances, Just because he had several good games in 5 men defence and had a great game at rightback against 4th league opponent who never played on that big pitch doesn't make him overall great performer. He was solid for his age and is the one for the future. But people are carried away little too much don't you think when it comes to players from our academy..

Rafael's average level of performances has been solid let's leave it here. You don't need to compare him to anyone.

2463~~~
So what really is your suggestion going forward?

2464~~~
Rooney and RVP are not having a great season, but they've both been comfortably better than Rafael. McNair has too. You should read your first paragraph again. Its almost laughable in all honesty and with all due respect. RVP is our top scorer with 9 goals this season and Rooney is on 8 with 4 assists. Like I said, not great by their standards but still better seasons than Rafael surely. 

Even going by 'average score' just look at the statistics, Whoscored.com and Squawka all have higher average scores for Rooney, RVP and McNair. Whats this argument about Rafael not playing his best position? He's mostly played in the diamond formation with a flat back four. His best two games against Everton and West Ham were played as a natural RB in a back four. So please check your facts.

2465~~~
I wouldn't be leaving him on the sidelines our out of the matchday squad entirely, that's for sure. The club need to determine whether his improved durability of recent seasons remains true, for besides the cheekbone fracture his other two injuries were fairly minor. I understand that a manager will want to reward a player who stepped up to the plate in a time of crisis, however there comes a point where you ought to reintroduce the natural fullback.

2466~~~
Valencia is looking natural in that position now. I can't make a single argument against starting him there in the absence of a consistent RB. Even McNair is getting groomed in this position now. Its looking bleak for Rafael but his story is not over yet.

2467~~~
Playing for the U21s again.

2468~~~
One could be a boon to our attacking play, whereas the other is a dead weight comparatively speaking. The situation with McNair is an ominous devopment for Rafael should it continue.

2469~~~
When are they playing?

2470~~~
No need to lead an argument with someone who thinks otherwise.. With all respect to you you can do better than point out that RVP has scored as few as 9 goals this season while playing absolutely terribly at times. Rooney the same, he was always productive but his overall play is getting worse every year, he is also well past his peak.. and these players are <b>attacking</b> players, Rooney obviously plays in midfield lately but Van Persie is the first striker in the team who should do much better. Van Persie scoring 9 goals and rafael none is great argument really, he's defender, man.-) And strikers will always win these statistics, anyway I couldn't care less about it. I tent to watch football and judge players according their overall display and what they give to the team, not just statistics who can be often misleading like in this case.

Rafael has done better at his position(as defender) than RVP at his position as striker. There is no doubt about it. But you can obviously check whoscored and play football manager than watch football if you care about statistics but tbf I guess it is very subjective to compare players so the statistics can help but not in this case. Rafael has played just few games but I think he was overall very good unlike frustrating Van Persie or Rooney most of the time..

People are being really harsh on Rafael as they don't clearly remember some of his performances. You are probably the one who said that he was to blame for the 5-3 Leicester disaster...

2471~~~
I guess LvG is very strict concerning fitness. He doesn't dare to play him with a niggle. Might be the right the to do. Who knows how many times he's played with a slight injury only for it to get worse.

2472~~~
You're biased towards him as he's one of your favorite players. Most people here love the guy to death but realistically, he's played 9 games and he's been his regular good self in about three of those games. RVP is top scorer, I did mention that he's not having a great season by his standards but his contribution is more important than Rafael's so far. You must be blinded by your devotion to him.

He's having a disappointing season and you say he's been <i>excellent</i>. You're the one who also mentioned game score average and now you're berating my use of those stats. You're also making foolish assumptions about me playing the blame game.

If anything Blackett is the one who recieved most of the blame for that game you mention. Rafael is having his worst season in years and he'll do well to turn things around before summer. Time is ticking on his United career

2473~~~
Do you mean a niggle on his face?

2474~~~
That some kind of British slang?

2475~~~
How did he go for the U/21s? Or have they not played yet?

2476~~~
Played with the right attitude and made some good runs down the flank, our best player after Pereira.

2477~~~
Fair enough point and I agree that he misses too many games through injury. That is not what I said. My issue is people calling his performances "poor". They haven't been. When on the pitch his performances have generally been excellent. He has been easily the best right back at the club this season.

2478~~~
What utter garbage.

2479~~~
I've always liked Rafael but I think Valencia and McNair are probably ahead of him in the pecking order for LvG at the moment.

2480~~~
Valencia deserves credit for being very steady. But being steady isn't enough. We are dull slow and boring and hardly creating anything.  At times we look technically inferior to most top half teams which us inexcusable.  

Rafael is technically very good and plays quick and decisively with skill. Also defensively he is good too. You rarely see him get blown by with speed or skill. He is rash but actually gets the ball. His positioning on crosses and short stature are his weakest parts of his game along with the elephant in the room of too many injuries. 

Any who knows football will tell you that if he was healthy all the time he would start every game.

2481~~~
For the love of God, I just can't watch Valencia bomb down the flank and then cross it to no-mans land! How many attacks have broken down sigh. Rafael would make us a lot more incisive.

2482~~~
McNair is playing as RB with Valencia on the bench. 

Increasingly it looks like he'll be departing in the summer, and without a chance to fight for his place either which is a pity. At least he was able to be a key player in a title winning season.

2483~~~
Him and plenty of other recent/impending departees.

2484~~~
And some of those look a bit suspect at present; the jury remains very much out as regards LVG's squad management/transfers.

2485~~~
Who?

2486~~~
Yeah he's pretty much gone. I hate to see it as I love the little scamp and I suppose he can't stay fit for any extended period of time so It's understandable. However seeing as he's still much better than any of the options we currently have couldn't we at least still play him until the summer. I just don't get Van Gaal not rating him above Valencia and now McNair.

2487~~~
Which departures look suspect?

2488~~~
So how does it work? LvG decides that he doesn't like some players and they are bench warmers until sold?

Rafael, Smalling, Herrera would be in my starting XI always when fit.

2489~~~
I would have kept Danny at the club certainly, and though his form can be erratic at times Nani would bring more to the team than does Januzaj presently.

2490~~~
He is one of my favorite players <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2491~~~
We're going to lose a lot of good players because of LVG, one of them being Rafael. He hasn't even given him a proper chance.

2492~~~
Oh well, a top class RB in the summer is a must.

2493~~~
Mendes picks the team and texts it to Van Gaal.

2494~~~
Yeah, that seems to be the way football works. 

Not <i>every</i> player on the bench right now will be sold any time soon, obviously.

2495~~~
I actually forgot about Welbeck, I would have liked to keep him too but Nani was after stagnating here, a change was best for both parties imo.

2496~~~
Not to mention that Nani <i>should</i> bring more to the team right now than Januzaj. That's not really the point though. That logic would see us never bring through any youngsters.

2497~~~
Yeah obviously, but you can clearly see he doesn't rate some players. It's ok, he's the manager. But even when his team performs poorly and those players could actually do something about it, he still doesn't plan to use them. 

This is the first time I said something like that but I honestly think they are not in his plans for the future.

On the other hand, does it mean Falcao is staying?

2498~~~
Januzaj has time on this side though, the club does not. If the choice was to have only one player of that type at OT then Nani is ahead IMO. I can however, see why a player of his individualistic temperament might not suit the United that Van Gaal has created thus far (not that i am wholly approving of this).

2499~~~
My favorite player in the current team. It would be a shame to lose him, but Van Gaal clearly doesn't rate him <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2500~~~
Surely everyone knew he wasn't playing this game? Did he not just play on Monday for the U-21s? I's expect to see him back in the FA Cup game.

2501~~~
I agree. Valencia and even McNair's cameos at RB have been better.

2502~~~
This. He's played two 90 minutes for the U21s so you'd expect to have him back on Monday as you say. Sounds like LVG and the fitness coaches are building him up and being sensible about it so he can hopefully have a strong run through to the end of the season.

2503~~~
Absolutely gutted at what's happening to him. Have loved his progression and time at United, a player I have some much time for but it's obvious he is out the door. Such a shame, it's crazy that our best RB, can't make the squad, and a squad that needs a RB.

In my opinion, van Gaal should have let him go in January, he will play Rooney at RB before Rafael. And the scary thing is, that could be a possibility.

If he doesn't make the squad against Preston, besides the tears, I will be starting the tough goodbye.

2504~~~
Is Rafael the new Nani for this season?  All this love him/hate stuff seems like deja vu.

2505~~~
No LVG is being stubborn and not playing him because he hates Rafaels guts. Its the only possible reason.

2506~~~
Why?

2507~~~
We live in hope.

2508~~~
If he has no intention to play him (that will be confirmed against Preston), what is the point in depriving a player to play football. Many clubs around the world would love to have Rafael, he could very well go until next season without playing senior football.

He has McNair, Valencia and Rooney ahead of him at RB, I just don't see the logic behind it.

2509~~~
He has and he was fantastic up until the Leicester match where he made a mistake and he has dissappeared eversince.

2510~~~
If you can't depend on a player to stay fit and play regularly, what use are they? Unlucky for him, but I'd rather move on..

2511~~~
Rafael played 90 for the reserves on monday, which is why he didn't play last night. Chill guys he should be back for the FA cup.

2512~~~
Bring back the Raf!

2513~~~
him not playing wasn't a surprise as he featured for the u-21s. i think he has completed 90 minutes twice now for the second team. 

however if he is still not starting for the next fa cup tie, he is a goner. to be honest, i don't see LVG dropping valencia or mcnair for rafael at this moment which means...

2514~~~
If he somehow finds himself back in the first team he'll transform our season. A fit Rafael is so far ahead of our other options it's ridiculous. People forget how he can dominate a flank much the way Evra did in his pomp...

2515~~~
Bolded is an oxymoron and at the same time the reason <i>why</i> people forget how he can dominate a flank.

2516~~~
Building him up from his fractured cheekbone? What, in case he...re-aggravates the injury?

Rafael was deemed fit enough to be on the bench against Cambridge at the Abbey, but has since been relegated to the U-21s. I don't think your hypothesis holds up i'm afraid, not with McNair even having supplanted a place on the bench in the interim.


He actually played well after Leicester too, indeed WhoSocred have him as the MOTM in the very next fixture.

The fact remains however, that the most naturally talented attacking fullback at the club is being sadly underused, to put it kindly. For weeks on end end he is fit enough to start matches, both prior to and since Yeovil, although much like with Herrera it is proving to be quite the task.

2517~~~
Not sure if you meant to quote me as it doesn't counterract my point, I don't doubt his quality, more the worth of quality when it's always injured.

2518~~~
That is a much a hypothesis and guesswork as my own! We don't know the status of his fitness; he may have picked up another knock pre/post Cambridge or he could just be out of favour.

2519~~~
Rafael? Pick up another knock? Preposterous suggestion!

2520~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2521~~~
It's hard to take opinons about Rafael seriously when you read shit like that. Transform our season? He'll be lucky to be here come the start of next season.

2522~~~
Nice one <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Shame about Rafael having so much problems with injuries, really like him, but you can't count on him being fit for more than 3 matches and perhaps that's why LVG lost patience with him.

2523~~~
Nice to read something like this, I'd love it to be true! I had the feeling LvG just didn't like him, but if he's being kept out of the team to build up fitness, that would be brilliant. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2524~~~
Can't he do Giggs yoga class?

2525~~~
Rafael, apart his contribution to the team which is in 90% cases bigger than Valencia's or now McNair's, is always a good catalyst, gives the team a bit of drive and tenacity which often players around him starts to motivate so I guess it is not a stupid point to make, it's rather stupid to read comment like yours already writting off our best right back past 5 years..

He's almost starting to be another Anderson, injury prone player, people almost forget how well he played just because he didn't play much, Not saying it is just you but your half-sarcastic comment suggest so..

2526~~~
Match rhythm has been built and it's an FA cup tie, surely seems like the perfect opporuntity to get him back on the field.

2527~~~
You've watched a different player then. A different player than the manager is obviously watching too. You must be watching a different team if you think a right back who doesn't create chances is going to transform us.

2528~~~
It's not about transforming it's about motivation and doing his job at his position, he doesn't need to have plenty of assists. Comparing him with Zabaleta/Clichy or Azpilacueta they have got an assist/500min in premier league, the same with Rafael. 

He is slightly better defensively than Valencia(who got better this season at defending) and obviously bigger threat when attacking always tries to get the ball before it gets to the player, starting attacks very early, he actually plays with his head up unlike Valencia..

He just didn't play that much because of injuries, nit because he's bad and manager may fancy rather players who can play more than three games in a row right now. Anyway I will leave it here you didn't understand what the posters said neither my explanation so I guess it's not necessary to continue in this pointless conversation..

2529~~~
He may not provide the final ball but he is involved in creating chances down the right for us when he plays.

2530~~~
For example?

2531~~~
Dear God, no.

2532~~~
QPR Wetsham Leicster linked up well with Herrera down the right. Think he got the assist vs Westham (the home game)

2533~~~
His interplay with team mates is superior for one, and Valencia has just one more assist than does Rafael in any event (and that with three times as many starts).


His lengthy absences are not, however, these do not appear to follow any sort of pattern  irrespective of fitness.

Given Van Gaal's meticulous recording of the injured players in the squad, the idea that he sustained a further knock doesn't sound all that plausible. Moreover, had such occurred he would hardly have been on the bench or started for the U-21s.

2534~~~
That's sort of looking at it from Rafael's point of view though. He may not be in favour, but van Gaal might still  need to call on him at some point, given the way we pick up injuries. Would have made little sense for the club to sell him in January.

2535~~~
1 assist and linked well? Against two of the worst teams in the Legue at that. We're definitely going to need to transform our season though it's a shame we won't be playing those teams again this season. Are we going to pretend Valencia doesn't link well?

2536~~~
I can only go on games he has played this season, and anyway its a feature of his game when he plays all seasons he has played.
Yes Valencia links well, but who said he didn't? I feel from RB Rafaels final ball/positivity is better than Valencia going forward.

2537~~~
I assume the Rooney is a joke but why do you think McNair is definitely ahead of him? He's played two games (at home, against weak opposition) ahead of Rafael. 

People seem to very quick to decide x, y, z player is definitely not rated by Van Gaal because they sit out a game or two. If Fergie did the same people would have just assumed he was rotating his squad. Van Gaal has to rotate too, albeit for different reasons. We're not playing enough games to keep our fringe players happy/match-fit so he should take every opportunity to rotate when he can.

2538~~~
I'd be surprised if he doesn't play against Preston.

We can't rely on him going forward, that much is certain. But I don't think Valencia or McNair are the answer either. Maybe LvG just wants to see how he gets on playing games with a little less pressure before committing him back to the first team?

2539~~~
Yeh, taking the piss with Rooney but you can't say you would be surprised, I mean Rooney at right midfield is pretty close.

I agree and am not reading anything into this McNair our future RB for 10 years but I just can't see Rafael featuring again unless McNair, Valencia, probably Young and who knows maybe even Jones and Smalling are injured. I understand he might not be match fit (how can he be when he doesn't play) but when fit, he has not been given the same time as Valencia and it's just a shame as he is simply better, no one in their right mind will argue that.

I admit it's a bit kneejerk because I love Rafael but it's just hard to come to terms with when it's a simple case of not playing our best RB when we need one. This argument about he can't be relied upon, okay, I'll listen to that but we need our best players on the pitch and he makes us a better team.

2540~~~
He doesn't hate him but he probably knows he can't rely on him. Why do you think we're being linked with so many rightbacks? Rooney, Di Maria, Carrick and even Smalling have all been injured and rushed back without having to play U-21 games. Rafael's future at OT is in doubt, sorry to break it to you but the truth must be told.

2541~~~
How much can we realistically get for him this summer? 7M would be great business considering terrible transfer outs record.

2542~~~
7m would also be a bloody steal were we to sell him so cheaply. 

And then that's another thing, if the club has indeed reached such a decision then the U-21s represents a very poor shop window.

2543~~~
That's true, but yuo could put forward that due to his history of injuries, the staff may want to ease him back in and build up his strength before. Not saying that's the case, just that we don't really know that much, so just keeping my mind open.

2544~~~
Fair enough, but he's fast running out of opportunities to prove himself before the season is over. A lot of players will be worrying about their fate this summer and he's certainly one of them

2545~~~
I cannot imagine ascension where a club would pay more than that for a player who can't play for half a season. 7m would be great business.

2546~~~
The feck? talk of selling him for £7m? you lot are crazy.

2547~~~
I wouldn't be surprised. As high as he's rated, he's not a regular and injury prone. Add to that we usually sell players on the cheap.

2548~~~
People keep saying that but I don't think it's anywhere near as clear-cut as they think. Granted Rafael's been used sparingly this season, so it's a little hard to assess but he has made some really glaring defensive errors in his brief time on the pitch. Something that a player as unpopular as Valencia would have been absolutely crucified for on here. Let's ignore this season and look back at last season. Rafael played 19 of our league games and looked a shadow of the player he once was. Decent enough going forwards but some woefully amateurish defensive displays. Valencia wasn't great last season either but this season has improved significantly as a fullback and - IMO - has become as good a defender as Rafael ever was. Call me conservative but defending should always be the main priority for a fullback. Obviously, they need to offer something going forward too and Valencia's already got more assists than Rafael has managed in at least half of his seasons for United so far. He's still a notch below the best attacking fullbacks in the league but maybe that will come. He was once a decent winger, after all.

I like Rafael. On his day he's a fantastic fullback. I want him to succeed at United. However, he's in danger of going down that Anderson path where a player is so popular with the fans they don't notice his increasingly inconsistent displays on the pitch until long past the point where it's obvious to the neutrals.Remember when we were singing about Anderson "shitting on Fabregas"? I can't help wondering if all the chat about Rafael being "the best right back in the league" will ring just as hollow in a few years time. Injuries (again, a similarity with Anderson) have played a big part in derailing the progress he showed earlier on in his career but there's nothing anyone can do about that. Not being able to stay fit is almost as big an issue for a footballer as having a poor first touch, or lack of pace. You can't affect a game from the treatment room.

<b>IF</b> he can stay fit from now until the end of the season, he's got a decent chance of getting back to the top of the pecking order at RB. The longer he stays fit the more likely he will get closer to the form he showed in his one really good season at United, back in 2012/13 (the only time he made more than 20 league appearances) I'm sure we all hope that happens. He'll really need to buck a long-established trend to do so, though. Fingers crossed this is possible.

2549~~~
Can't rely on him going forward? Have you seen Valencia? 

Rafael's link up play is far better than most people here are giving him credit for. He's a class right back IMO.

2550~~~
We have only played well this season when he was on the field pushing the play to the opposition half. One of our most important players without doubt. The problem with him is that he really can't string 10 matches together.

2551~~~
He's also injured far too often.

A nice option to have in the squad, but I feel going forward we should be looking at getting another player in who can stay fit. It's a shame because as you say he has shown himself to be very capable.

2552~~~
Incorrect. Our best performances this season have probably been QPR(H), Hull, Newcastle, Liverpool and that first half against Spurs. Rafael played in one out of those five games. The one against the weakest opposition.

2553~~~
7m , here use my pen.

2554~~~
So meticulous that in his press conferences he will provide updates only on certain members of the squad and we are often left guessing as to the status of others (Rafael often having been one of these). We don't know everything from this side, and how anyone can honestly speak with certainty on this issue is accordingly impossible. And re: your last point, there is over a two week period between his bench appearance vs Cambridge and his first appearance for the U21s - again, who knows what's gone on in that time?

Anyhow - I do nonetheless agree with your over-arching viewpoint. If he now has enough minutes under his belt and is at a good level of fitness, Rafael should be playing, no question. Starting Monday.

2555~~~
Pretty sure he played against Spurs... I was there. Although he may have been a 2nd half sub.

2556~~~
Came on at half-time in that game. Which makes my point even more convincing!

2557~~~
We're not Chelsea. What would you sell him for? He's not even a Brazil international.

2558~~~
Not in the squad again. If any of you had any doubts, I think LVG not rating him is pretty much confirmed.

2559~~~
I think Valencia deserves to be first choice right-back, and I fully support van Gaal if is he is to sell Rafael. But it's a bit weird that he's been frozen out completely, no?

2560~~~
His career at Old Trafford is 100% over unless Valencia, McNair, Jones and Smalling are together injured

2561~~~
it's not looking good for him, he hasn't really had a chance under LvG.

2562~~~
I much prefer Valencia, but I feel sorry for rafael for being frozen out

2563~~~
People prefer Valencia? That's crazy.

2564~~~
It's not really, he's been pretty reliable this season, which is more than we can say about Rafael.

2565~~~
Valencia is much more solid defensively, with our defence that's my priority. If he remains the confidwnce and totally develops in the rb role he could be class. Sorry Rafa, but he's as unreliable as you get, not what we need.

2566~~~
Yeah but you are desperate for us to sign Seamus Coleman and were on Rafael's back all of last season. I don't get it. Apart from his injuries he's proved to be more than good enough and offers a lot more than Valencia at right back. How can anyone prefer Valencia there, I really don't get it. Another one of LVG's weird decisions like persisting with Rooney in midfield.

2567~~~
He's reliable defensively but he pretty much destroys any defensive strengths with how completely miserable he is going forward. I'd prefer Rafael every single time.

2568~~~
He's gone. 

Real shame, one of my favourites. Just could never stay fit and thats ultimately cost him.

Proper right back needed in the summer.

2569~~~
Falcao is getting games every week so obviously form means very little in LVG's thinking.

2570~~~
Sad way for his United career to peter out. Van Gaal needs to buy a top replacement if he has no faith in Rafael.

2571~~~
Good player, but not consistent enough. People moan about Valencia, but he's Mr reliable, and you need reliable players in your squad.

I guess a right back is a priority in the Summer, unless Van Gaal sees McNair as a replacement for Rafael.

2572~~~
That's a huge part of it though - he can't be relied upon because he gets injured way too frequently.

2573~~~
Well that's not true.

2574~~~
Not consistent enough and is made of glass. Don't blame van Gaal for not using him. 

It's sad because it looked like he had amazing promise.

2575~~~
Yes, and like I said injuries are the only reason. How anyone can prefer Valencia over a fit Rafael though is beyond me.

2576~~~
Valencia was voted utd player of the month for jan, he is one of our more consistent defenders.

Going forward he can still be frustrating but he is still a very useful outlet. And is very disciplined

Rafael is going backwards and has not progressed in anyway shape or form offer the last 2 or so years.

I don't think its even a hard  decision for Lvg to pick Valencia over him.

But of course we should buy a good right back next summer

2577~~~
So you weren't in the Coleman thread all season giving him praise whilst downplaying Rafael's accomplishments with us? Coleman's not been so great this season has he, I guess it's the other defender's fault, or Martinez.

2578~~~
Because we'd only get a fortnight out of Rafael before it'd be back to the drawing board, might as well keep Valencia in the team because Rafael's injuries are genuinely that bad.

2579~~~
People prefer Valencia? Wow. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2580~~~
Who was the competition? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Really, we were absolute shite in january. He was at fault for West Ham's goal partly, by giving the ball away and committing a stupid foul, the same thing Rafael gets lambasted for every time he does it. I hope we do buy a new right back because Valencia kills the right hand side.

2581~~~
I only praised Coleman as much as to say he's better than Rafael, which I still feel is true. If you actually bothered to read my Coleman posts you'd see that I don't rate him too much better than Rafael, it's just he isn't made of glass and can be relied upon for a season. Which is all true.

2582~~~
If you take out the fractured cheekbone which can hardly be attributed to a weakness on Rafael's part, he has been fit without breaking down again for somewhere in the region of three moths. It's a quite baseless accusation for much of this season.

2583~~~
It's baffling to be honest. A fit Rafael is at worst as defensively solid as Valencia, and contributes much more going forward.

That said, his injury record is appalling and a completely legitimate reason to build your team around other players. Valencia has been solid enough this season, so it's not really a strange decision to prefer him, and choose others as his back up. I do fully expect us to cash out for a top class right back though, because we're lacking one. Comparing our options to those of other top teams, it's a real weak spot.

2584~~~
Considering LVG thinks Rooney balances the team in midfield, leaving out Herrera every week and making weird decisions all the time, it's no surprise he ignores Rafael. Too attack minded for LVG.

2585~~~
Well I think it's not an unfair assessment of Rafael, he simply is injury prone, no two ways about it. He's a great little full-back, people appear to take my lack of patience for his injuries as me not rating him, he's simply not reliable.

2586~~~
It's amazing how people have forgotten how well Rafael was playing when he was fit. He was a major part of all our attacks down the right and contributing to goals. He's the best right back we have and it's a pity LVG can't see that.

2587~~~
Sadly agree his time is up. Unfortunate because outside of Rooney we don't have anyone that really plays with outward passion on the field like he does.

2588~~~
Yep, Jones and Evans have had worse seasons with rotten injury records and get back in the team when they are fit. Falcao plays every game for god knows what reason because he seems to be getting worse (If that's possible).

2589~~~
Methinks that some on this forum need reminding of United's attacking ideals; a potent offence does itself contribute to a team's defending.

2590~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2591~~~
Doesn't matter. He can never stay healthy.

2592~~~
I'd argue pretty strongly that Rafael is far superior defensively, as I suspect you would too, he's not as strong in the tackle and not as quick. But by every other possibly measure of a good defender he's simply better. People's memories on here are very short.

2593~~~
His ability isn't in question, and that's not the reason he's not playing. We all know he can be a great full-back, but we all know he suffers a hell of a lot of injuries. 

It's pretty simple stuff really.

2594~~~
And solid defending contributes to the team's offense.

2595~~~
McNair is now the back up/competing RB to Valencia, farewell sweet Raf. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2596~~~
It clearly is.

2597~~~
Your claim doesn't stand up to scrutiny though, not so far as 2014/15 goes at any rate.

2598~~~
Can't fault that logic. He managed to avoid getting injured by being out injured. A flawed strategy but an effective one.

2599~~~
How? Way I see it is van Gaal, and perhaps Giggs, has lost patience with Rafael's constant injuries. Which is nothing to do with his ability.

2600~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2601~~~
Read the thread, theres a large proportion of people in questioning his ability.

2602~~~
Yeah it's harsh, but that's why LvG is our coach. I like Rafael too and would probably keep him as backup choice. But we did that with Anderson, Cleverley, Fletcher and look what happened. It's not really new news that Rafael can't stay fit and LvG gave him the chance at the beginning of the season, but it seems that he has realized now that any plan with Rafael as RB will not work. Valencia is solid this season, so a new RB, Valencia and McNair for next season should be the way to go.

Posted this already in the match forum. It's the right decision. People complain about us beeing sentimental or complain about our injury record and then want to give him another season, where he will play a total of 5 games. I like him too, but we need to get rid of our crocks. Doesn't matter if he looks decent in the small amout of games. The truth is, a average RB who can play 30-40 games for us is much more worth than Rafael

2603~~~
It looks that way. I presume that McNair is preferred to him on the bench today?

2604~~~
Are they? Well I'm not, I just feel there's little point persisting with a player who will continue to suffer a lot of injuries throughout his career.

2605~~~
Aye, I unfortunately agree. I love Rafael, think he's brilliant and love watching him play. Sadly a vote for Rafael is a vote for Valencia, and I can't stomach another season of him.

2606~~~
There is no need to be so facetious all of the time Pogue. My point, as you were undoubtedly aware, was that being smashed in the face oughtn't fall under the weak body/injury prone heading. And if one takes such into account he "broken down" since last Autumn.

2607~~~
I would say Valencia is close to Rafael defensively right now. I trust him. Rafa is clearly better offensively but I can understand why he isn't trusted. Nothing suggests his injury problems will end.

2608~~~
Rafael is not i would argue so lacking in that department, and comparatively speaking Valencai's offensive qualities are much worse.

2609~~~
Think Valencia is nothing more than a solid full-back, he has his ups and downs, but he'll do 'til we can bring in a new right-back in the summer.

2610~~~
Injury prone players get injured in all sorts of ways. Whether rash in the challenge, clumsy or just unlucky. Doesn't have to be some sort of congenital muscular weakness. Look at Phil Jones.

2611~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2612~~~
All this discussion aside, Rafael does appear to be nestling between a tub of Ben and Jerry's and some potato skins.

And knowing football he'll probably have an injury free 2012/13 type season the instant he moves. Ah well.

2613~~~
Yes, absolutely, I fully agree with you.

2614~~~
If he's fit, he should be playing. I couldn't disagree more with the latest RedCafe Twitter tweet. Valencia is one of United's biggest problems due to him (and usually our left back/left wingback who isn't Young) being way too defensive.

2615~~~
I do not think there is a chance that the likes of Valencia and McNair are better RBs . I guess it is understandable seeing him frozen out like this because of his injury record but, I am still not a fan of losing him. I really do not think we will find a better RB in the market.

2616~~~
Yeah I must say I think Valencia / RB is a major weak point for us at the moment, surely must be addressed in Summer. I know Rafael played in the u21's so it seems he is fit.

2617~~~
Have any journos asked LVG what the feck is going on here?

2618~~~
They probably don't care as none of the British hacks have ever rated him anyway.

2619~~~
Does it even matter if they asked?, you already know what he'll say, "He needs match rhythm!, all my players need to train before they return to the team" which he ignores for his faves, Blind, Carrick, Rojo, RvP etc.
I'd be astonished, literally jaw dropping staggered if LvG didn't say he could go this summer.

2620~~~
A sad day, one of my real favourites over the years. Has given nothing less than 100% for the club, sometimes shit happens, I would guess he would be as disappointed as anyone because he really loves the club.

Would hate to see him move on to another club in England.

Would love to see him be given one last run at Old Trafford though, he deserves it.

2621~~~
Who are the best gettable right backs in Europe just now then? I think Clyne would be vastly overpriced, and I'm not a big fan of Coleman. So on the continent I can't think of anyone that is a stand-out either. There is a real dearth of quality right backs.

2622~~~
I think it was the game against West Ham where you couldn't pick one mistake he did, he made some very crucial interceptions inside our own box and was class all the way.
I'll be very sad if he is being sold in the summer, definitely one of my favourite players. The question is if he will get a chance to win his place back this season, and then he would have to take it and stay fit.

2623~~~
All I hope for is that he at least is given a chance to win his place back. He still wears that #2 on his back; he's still our best RB.

2624~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xz11MLk4sAc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2625~~~
Clyne, Coleman, Danilo, Darmian and Mario Fernandes. That's about it, I think. Darmian isn't that good nor is any other right-back in Italy. Coleman hasn't been as good as he was last season. Clyne is decent, but as you say overpriced, which we probably won't care about. With Danilo it's hard to tell if he would be as good as he seems to be for Porto. It's ridiculous when you compare it to the left-back position. France alone have 4 potentially great players for their left-back spot in Digne, Mendy, Kurzawa and Amavi.

2626~~~
Good list there - I don't think you've missed out any big names. I cannot disagree with much of what you have said.

I don't think Clyne is actually close to Rafael as a full-back, though that may change with his development. He clearly has potential and has performed very well this season, but he's still not a massive improvement (though still an improvement), in the form of his life, over a Rafael who is probably playing the worst football he has ever played. I don't mean to underrate him, though - he clearly has some quality. Coleman is a solid player, though I feel he is terribly overrated - like his teammate Baines, I feel people tend to gloss over his deficiencies at the back because he isn't called Luis Anderson da Silva, or something. He is actually not so great defensively & I feel pundits (and PL fans alike) don't pick up on it as much as they should do. 

Danilo looks like a good player for the future. He's a year younger than Rafael, too. I think he has a lot of good qualities (both in defence and attack) and would actually suit us very well. Again, however, I don't see him as much of an improvement on Rafael, if any at all. At least he is fit, though. 

On an unrelated note, I really like the look Lucas Digne. He looks like a brilliant left-back, prospect-wise. He can even play on the left of midfield. PSG have quite a player on their hands. If he develops properly (one never knows), I think France may have their left-back position sorted for the next 10 years or more.

2627~~~
Played in the reserves tonight, did a horrible tackle and was subbed off.

2628~~~
Apparently appeared frustrated throughout the game as well.

2629~~~
Maybe he was the player in the "video" recently and he's being punished. I'd like a journo to ask Van Gaal at the next presser. Where is Rafael?

2630~~~
Was meant to come off before with a knock too but he seemed to run it off. Then went flying in with that challenge which could have been a red and he got hooked. Was definitely a page out of his old self, won't be doing himself any favours with that.

2631~~~
Watched the CL game with Srna in tonight. Such a composed player and would be a great player to fill our RB position for a few seasons.
Rafael seems to have let himself down tonight and I just don't see him getting back in the side. The club will need to sell him this summer if they want anything for him. He doesn't warrant a new contract as he will want a first team wage.

2632~~~
Our best RB doesn't deserve to be in the first team?

2633~~~
Easy on the getting rid talk. Valencia is ~30 and he's looking like he's physically declining very quickly. Rafa is still 24.

2634~~~
If our best RB could play more then half a season yes, but he can't. His form hasn't been good the last 2 seasons, when he has played, so I don't get why the club should reward him with a contract unless it was as a back up player.
We need to buy a RB who can play a season, play consistently and be available. That's who should get the first team wage.

2635~~~
I'd doubt that, he's been married for a good 3-4 years and his instagram/facebook posts revolve around his children and wife. I think it's just a clear case of a manager not rating him and his lack of fitness is simply working in the managers favour.

2636~~~
Well to be fair to him, he is fit, he just isn't getting picked for some weird reason. Also, a back up player is in the first team. Can't go through  a season with 11 players.

2637~~~
Valencia is still way less likely to be injured at any given moment though. He is also one of our physically strongest players, something our team generally lacks.

At this stage I'd be amazed if Valencia is sold before Rafael.

2638~~~
Yes, at the present he's still a rock, but I really feel he'll be done by early next season, he's starting to look his age very quickly.

2639~~~
That is basically the same thing Fabio did before he was sold I think. Looks like it is definitely over for Rafa, which is very sad. He loves the club and I think should be our RB. Will be interesting to see where he goes from here.

2640~~~
It'd be stupid to sell him, just bring in proper competition.

2641~~~
But he can't get ahead of the so called non proper competition.

2642~~~
Can't get ahead of Valencia and McNair now. He'd just be relegated to 4th in line if we get another one in.

2643~~~
Yeh he's off in the summer. LvG massively doesn't rate him.

2644~~~
I would keep him as backup and bring in a first choice RB.

2645~~~
I wouldnt really call the tackle horrible he was fouled just before hand and jumped in a bit but was never any danger of him doing any damage to Pienaar

2646~~~
Rafael and new RB next season will be perfect. But I guess LvG does not rate him.
I know Valencia is doing a job, but in games against inferior opposition, Rafael will have a lot to offer.
Rafael being behind Valencia and McNair is nonsense, I think it's a wrong call from LvG.

2647~~~
I guess that he isn't doing it on the training ground. LVG said players need to show it there to get in the side. 
Rafael is clearly doing something wrong as he isn't even getting an opportunity.

2648~~~
Maybe, but he doesn't strike me as someone who doesn't give 100% when playing football, training or not.

2649~~~
A real shame since I thought he was developing into a top player in Fergie's last season. Too many of our younger players have just fallen flat.

2650~~~
Totally given, he always gives it everything on the pitch. I guess we won't know until either he is sold or gets into the team. I don't buy that he isn't fit or not match ready. Maybe this is just a LVG master plan to get him revved up, ready to be released on the pitch....I doubt it though.

2651~~~
I think he's possibly too unpredictable and plays with too much ferocity for van Gaal's liking. The manager constantly talks about balance and we know he's a stickler for following roles down to a T. It's a real shame as Rafa is one of my favourite United players and I rate him really highly. Would be really disappointing if he was allowed to leave rather than given a real chance.

2652~~~
I would think LVG has already made up his mind on Rafael and he will be sold.  McNair has been good for his age but there is nothing that justifies him getting a place ahead of Rafael.

2653~~~
Nothing near a top player. Trust me he's overated and he won't be first choice for France or PSG

Layvin Kurzawa from Monaco is the real deal

2654~~~
Everytime i read his name i have to think about Guidetti.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/15/1413328481647_wps_77_Sweden_s_John_Guidetti_L_.jpg" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/15/1413328481647_wps_77_Sweden_s_John_Guidetti_L_.jpg"/>

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2655~~~
Yeah I think that he deserved that, but I rheard that Chitteh want him for next year, and he'll prove that he's a very good player, far better than Clichy

2656~~~
I hope that Rafael stays, but I do feel much more comfortable with Valencia at RB.

2657~~~
I'd find it really hard to believe that Rafael is not training well. Just seems like LVG is content with reliable Valencia. As for McNair at RB the other day, supposedly Rafael really was just coming back to fitness.

LVG just seems highly averse to putting on players that are deemed riskier even though they may provide more to the team. Herrera is in the same boat I think - could offer the team a lot but, his style is not one to conform to the rigid way LVG wants us playing right now.

2658~~~
Big fan, but I wonder if his career will go the same way as his brother.  Fabio can't even get on the Cardiff bench at the moment from what I saw.

2659~~~
To be fair, there are many that agree with you - he doesn't always impress when given a rare chance & there are times when his weaknesses are exposed, but I just think he has all the makings of a potentially top player. I don't actually think he's there just yet, of course. Nowhere near. He cannot even get games ahead of Maxwell.

Kurzawa I have not seen much of this season (I stopped watching French football regularly about a year ago), but I do recall watching him before in the youth tournaments & he always stood out. He's actually older than Digne, but is definitely a huge prospect. He is linked with a move to Arsenal, is he not?

2660~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Just looked that up - serves him right!

2661~~~
He has been recently, but you have to wonder whether it's just a case of 2 + 2 = Kurzawa.

2662~~~
Perhaps you are right. That said, while I can't imagine any club would be happy to let him go, it's not like Monaco is a great place to be playing your football - there are other places that will pay more money that actually have fans. Even Falcao spoke about how bad it was like to play in front of just a few thousand people every week despite being one of the top sides in the division. I can see a lot of big clubs being in for him in the next season or two, where he will surely look to find a way out.

2663~~~
No doubt other clubs will be coming in for him if he continues to impress - quality LB's are few and far between. With regards to Arsenal, I think it came about the time rumours of Monreal moving back to Spain surfaced. If Monreal does move back to Spain at the end of the season then I think Arsenal's interest would be genuine. But credit where it's due, Monreal has been terrific at LB this season.

2664~~~
Indeed. I'll be surprised if he's still there by the time 16/17 comes around (assuming he has no major injury or decline in form). Agreed re Monreal - he's actually done very well, especially considering how things were looking for him when he started. I will reserve judgement for next season to see if it has just been a flash-in-the-pan bit of form, though he did show quality before he came to Arsenal, so who knows. He may well keep it up.

2665~~~
What happened to that boy? I was always on his corner, was pissed on Fergie loaned him out, signed Buttner and gave his number to RVP. Both of them have been a massive disappointment overall

2666~~~
How much do people realistically think will we get for Rafael when he is sold ?

2667~~~
4-6mill? he's a crock, hardly anyone rates him outside of Sir Alex's United staff and our sales to date bar the Ronaldo deal have tended to be rather low to say the least.

2668~~~
A shame - his partnership with AV down the wing was always strong and he could attack. Very strange why he isn't getting more of a run now that we have a flat back four. He didn't look great at RWB but it took AV and Young time there too so I don't think that should be against him..bu it seems LvG doesn't rate him.

2669~~~
He can't stay fit which is why he won't be given his chance.

Van Gaal doesn't want a large squad, he needs players who are reliable. Rafael, despite being arguably better at right back than Valencia, can't be relied upon as much, which is why Valencia will start ahead of him for the rest of the season. If you've got a winning side who perform well the last thing the manager wants to do is make changes to it. Whilst I don't think we are playing well, we are getting results.

2670~~~
I was going to say £5-7m but, like you say, we don't seem to be good at getting high prices (unlike Chelsea) so maybe this is optimistic.

2671~~~
Tevez didn't graft too much in training but he was great on the pitch.

2672~~~
Chavs would get £20M for him no problem, we should sell him to them with a sell on clause = pro£it

2673~~~
Considerably less than we could have obtained, but then United rarely sell to a profit and Van Gaal's mismanagement of the player makes for an additional handicap. 


Funny how that rule doesn't appear to be applied universally, for those players with a comparable injury record this season.  


Do you think that prudent, bearing in mind the nature of the PL and hopes of battling on four fronts? 

Whilst such might alleviate his questionable competence with regard to rotation, it is also likely to cost the squad in other ways as was witnessed over Xmas-New Year.

2674~~~
I assume that their owners are somehow feeding cash to other clubs with which to buy their players as a way to get around FFP

2675~~~
You what mate?

2676~~~
Again not on the bench. Is there really anybody on RedCafe who thinks Rafael will be a Manchester United player next season???

2677~~~
No. Valencia and McNair ahead of him. Says it all.

2678~~~
Well that's curtains for my favourite player. And Welbeck's departure still hurts as he was my other favourite.

2679~~~
This is sufficiently noteworthy to warrant at least some questioning from the media i feel. Considering McNair's relative inexperience at RB and the occasion of two recent FA Cup matches, this seeming banishment from even the bench is more indicative of disciplinary action of some kind.

2680~~~
Van Gaal is an idiot if he thinks McNair and Valencia should be ahead based on whatever it is he is smoking.

Rafael was our second best player behind Van Persie in Fergie's last season(i know people will say Carrick but not in my opinion). Even last season Rafael was doing well when he was playing, till November and then got caught in the Moyes' disease.

Even this season when he has played, he has dominated the right flank unlike any other player we have to dominate a flank - Not Shaw and not even Di Maria.

Van Gaal seems to have some weird notion of winning and attractive football, one which i don't agree with at all at this point of time

2681~~~
The media don't care about Rafael, they've never rated him.

2682~~~
If he leaves, my username is going to be totally crap. It's already 50% crap.

2683~~~
I thought Rafael is wearing a protective mask because of a very bad face injury, was I mistaken?

2684~~~
Well he's played in the last couple of of U21 games, so I take it his ok to play. 

I just think he's out of favour at the moment, with Van Gaal preferring to play Valencia and McNair at right back now.

Doubt he'll be here next season.

2685~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2686~~~
He's been totally frozen out. Very weird especially considering our options at RB. One of my Favourite players. Will be gutted when he leaves.

2687~~~
That hasn't been the case for some weeks, and the injury wasn't even that serious considering what might've been.

2688~~~
Yep, another of my favorites too. Hate seeing them leave.

2689~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2690~~~
You would hope that Van Gaal at least has the courtesy to grant Rafael one last hurrah; it's not as if he's done wrong by the club during his United career.

2691~~~
Not really surprised. It seems that LVG doesn't want to build club's RB future on an injury prone RB.

2692~~~
I do think it's harsh he's been completely frozen out. I'm assuming Giggs has been in van Gaal's ear, or someone similar, because he's continued to give our other injury prone defenders a chance this season. I would have kept him as backup, and brought in stiff competition this summer, but it looks likely he'll be off.

2693~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2694~~~
Unless Van Gaal has a fantastic right back lined up then selling Rafael is a joke. How he can rate Valencia ahead of him is beyond belief.

2695~~~
He hasn't, no, but we've been saying the same thing about Rafael since he arrived at the club.

It's not his fault, but if we want to move forward, and build a solid, consistent back four, we need a right back who will be able to stay fit for the majority of the season. Rafael, since his arrival, has been injury prone. Jones and Smalling the same. 

I have no doubt he'll be back in the team soon, though, but with Valencia, and now McNair, it seems Rafa has got healthy competition.

2696~~~
That doesn't stop him bringing Jones straight back into the team after he recovers from his fortnightly injury.

2697~~~
We have shit loads of injury prone player who get a chance to play. 

IMO the problem is Rafael is better at attacking than defending.

2698~~~
Not happy with that either to be fair.

2699~~~
I've always liked him as a player, he's good when he's fit but that's the thing. He never is consistently fit over a season. You need stability at the back and he doesn't provide it because of his injury problems.

2700~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2701~~~
McNair > Valencia > Rafael

Apparently.

2702~~~
It's actually sad LVG prefers McNair over him

2703~~~
Rafael would have created so many chances in this match if he started. So many.

2704~~~
LVG just doesn't seem to rate him.

There were stories at the start of the season to that effect too, weren't there?

2705~~~
To be honest I don't think LVG gives a crap about all that.

It's a joke to start McNair and leave Rafael out entirely.

2706~~~
Probably our best RB and doesn't play. I know he's injury prone but come one, no way is McNair better

2707~~~
Why has LVG completely frozen Rafael out? Sure, he has his flaws - but McNair isn't a right back and Valencia is fecking useless. Pretty much all our half-chances (and the goal) came from the left - first Shaw and later Young. Surely LVG realises that proper wing backs are important in the systems he wants to play? Puzzling as feck.

2708~~~
I don't think LVG has ever rated him, even back when he was Bayern manager in 2010. Perhaps the sending off has influenced his decision to not play Rafa as he deems him a liability. It's definitely not because he is worse than Valencia or McNair.

2709~~~
The treatment of Rafael is even more depressing when you see what could have been today.

Really wish him well and will miss the guy to death but he deserves to be playing football.

Crazy how our only RB can't get into our squad when we are in need of a RB.

2710~~~
Rafael has his flaws but how McNair plays there ahead of him is beyond me.

2711~~~
Was thinking about that too, first impressions and all that. And then the penalty incident at the start of the season didn't help (wasn't Rafa's fault but still).

But then again Rafael has played some matches for us, and definitely showed some skill on the ball in those games, had some amazing touches. Must be showing the same qualities in training sessions, and Van Gaal likes technical players. So I can't see Van Gaal not rating him, only reason I can think of is the injuries/quest for stability. Still very harsh on Rafael though, McNair has done great but it's so weird.

2712~~~
Baffling. The last thing LVG said about Rafael was him praising his 'character' or 'attitude' because he hurt his cheek and still wanted to play on.

This is exactly the tough mentality that we lack outside of Rooney and Jones.

Sick of watching Valencia and his shit crosses. Rafael's crossing isn't the greatest either but his attacking play is unpredictable and he links the right sided players so well. Basically he makes the entire right side of the pitch more dangerous and adds urgency and balls.

2713~~~
yes

2714~~~
Selling him has to to happen. He can't stay fit. Valencia hasn't put a foot wrong in the RB role this season.

2715~~~
What do you want, not putting a foot wrong or simply better performances?

It's not a dig at Valencia who has been good but Rafael gives so much more going both ways. He automatically makes us a better team compared to when anyone else is at RB.

2716~~~
Valencia has had some terrible performances this season at RB. He has been steady for a good while now but they've generally been nothing special and certainly nothing that can't easily be improved upon by bringing in a half decent specialised RB.

2717~~~
You'd think he missed 90% of games judging by some on here.

The lads been one of the most important players on recent seasons, he provides  genuine drive to our quick attacks. 

I fail to see why he cant rotate with Valencia.

2718~~~
What better performances? Its not like Rafael is vastly superior to Valencia. His crosses are very hit and miss and his dribbling ability is overrated. Valencia has done very well at RB, better than most expected and no one can argue with that. I don't care if people think Rafael is as good as Ronaldo, he's no good to the team if he can't play more than 3 games in a row.

2719~~~
We need to invest in a proper RB in summer, the meantime Valencia can be relied on to do a job. What terrible performances are you talking about btw? From a defensive or offensive standpoint? Can you name these 'terrible' performances without doing a google search? Sounds like a witch hunt. He's been solid defensively and the only disappointment ive seen is his contribution in attack which people feel should be more. You're looking for something that isnt there

2720~~~
It's utterly baffling Smores, it's one of the few complaints I have with LvG tbh because Rafael is a superior rightback/wingback than Valencia imo.

2721~~~
McNair should not be in the squad ahead of him (as a RB). It's ridiculous that Rafael is frozen out when he is the superior player.

"Hasn't put a foot wrong" as in hasn't contributed at all offensively and has done a decent job defensively? He's the sort of player we should be keeping at RB if we're aiming for mediocrity. 

According to Transfermarkt, Shaw has missed the same amount of games as Rafael through injury, with Rafael missing another 6 games due to not being included in the squad. Rojo has only missed two less games than Rafael due to injury too.

The whole defence has been hit by injuries this season, and Rafael has actually not missed as many games as Jones. So why he's the one bearing the brunt of the "never fit" tag I don't know. He's a better player than McNair and Valencia, and when he's fit (like now) he should be playing. If Van Gaal really isn't playing him because he doesn't see him as a future RB at the club then he needs to be careful. Rafael is our best RB and if LVG doesn't meet his objectives and people point towards his right back choice as one of the reasons then it may not be Rafael who doesn't have a future at the club either next season or the season following that.

2723~~~
Hasn't put a foot wrong as in doesn't deserve to be dropped for a player that won't play more than three games anyway so why even bother? Just let him keep doing what he's doing...a good job.

LVG should be careful? This sounds nothing short of a rant coming from a staunch fan/follower of an individual player. Rafael will never be the future of any team with his appalling fitness record. If we do sell him in summer he's going to end up just like his brother Fabio. We'll never hear from him again at this elite level of football.

I used to be both Fabio and Rafael's biggest fans until I realised they'll never be good enough for United. Its not his fault, we just need to say thank you and move on.

2724~~~
Bet he starts the next match.....Such is LVG's warped mind

2725~~~
It is a real mystery to me anyway, rate him a-lot. Thought he'd be one that would have no issue under LVG. Be very sorry to see him sold, the inevitability of it is oncoming the more games he is absent. Miss his quality and passion, the latter is something so sorely missing in the robots of today's game. He links much better with the man in front, giving the team more fluidity. It doesn't matter who is in-front of him either.

2726~~~
Guys relax, we'll see Rafael soon.

I think I've figured this out. De Gea, Blind, Di Maria, Rojo and Rooney always start when fit. The rest of them we'll give them a run of a few games and then drop them for awhile like we did with Herrera, Smalling, Januzaj and Mata. It will come when you least expect it for Valencia and Rafael will start. Of course knowing his luck he'll probably get injured or sent off.

2727~~~
I hope that Rafael's missing games means that his issues are fitness related. If LvG believes that Valencia or McNair are better RBs, he is mistaken. Rafa is prone to injuries that is for sure, however, out of fit trio, my first pick would be Rafa, then Tony and Paddy being the last.

2728~~~
Fabio - Rafa tearing teams apart from each wing is something that should have happened more. Such a shame to see them both so hampered by injuries.
Well, Rafa can still bounce back. He still has time to impress LVG, or maybe a loan wouldn't be too bad before considering selling him.

2729~~~
Van Gaal clearly doesn't rate Rafael. The only reasons I can think of for him not playing are his lack of height and the fact that he plays more with his heart than his head.

On the other side of the coin though, he prefers Jones to Smalling. Jones is far weaker in the air and is probably the least intelligent footballer I have ever seen.

2730~~~
He's not doing a good job though. Defensively he's improved a bit, but he's still no better than Rafael - both are prone to simply switching off. Offensively Valencia offers absolutely feck all. He gets the ball, spins around a bit and then either smashes it at a defender or passes it back. Look at other seasons (yeah, I'm bringing up other seasons because we've barely seen Rafael this season and Valencia is pretty much the same) and see the difference in our team when Rafael was playing compared to Valencia. Look at the game yesterday - how many chances came from the right? Herrera set up a couple of good attacks, but Valencia contributed feck all.

Rafael's injury history is certainly an issue and despite being a big fan, I don't have a problem if the club were to get a new right back who was more reliable. But as of this moment, we have Rafael, Valencia and now McNair competing for the right back position. Considering Valencia's form and the fact that McNair isn't a right back (looked ok there on occasion, but it's pretty clear that he doesn't have the attributes you want for a right back) I frankly don't understand why Rafael isn't getting a chance. We've always looked like a better team in the past when Rafael played.

2731~~~
He's finished at United, not sure why he's not being picked but he must've done something pretty wrong for McNair to be ahead of him.

2732~~~
McNair ahead of him is madness. Looks like he's been frozen out now. Bad injury records don't stop the likes of jones and smalling from getting back into the side. It seems like LVG has something against him. McNair is no way good enough to be playing there, or at all.

2733~~~
His crosses, well first of all, hit or miss, at least he has a cross. Giving a defender a dead shin isn't crossing. I say that as a fan of Valencia and appreciate his effort and output.

In terms of his fitness, I agree, it's an issue but when he is fit, like he has been, he can't help the team if he isn't in the team. There is no reason from what we can see for him not to be playing. He is fit, so he should be in the squad at least. Anytime we have the chance to field our strongest side, we should. If Rafael is fit, he makes us a better side, he should play. If he is injured next week, then yes, deal with it then but cross that hurdle when it comes.

2734~~~
He's hasn't looked himself this season when he played, and I guess we can put this down to him not having a full pre-season (because of injury again). He hasn't had a chance to really impress Van Gaal, and unfortunately this will be his undoing. He'll be very lucky to still be a United player by the start of next season.

2735~~~
I think the combination of his injury record and his height has cost him a place as first choice, and McNair/Valencia will cost him his place as second choice if we do buy another player in the summer. It's a shame, I like him, but I can't imagine him making the right back place his own again.

2736~~~
You say he'll never be the future as if he hasn't made significant contributions every season he's been here? 

He's made 20 prem appearances every season, its not ideal but it isn't a problem if we have decent backup. We need that backup of someone taller for tactical and more defensive anyway. 

Really hope LvG begins to give Rafael starts and uses McNair as that option.

2737~~~
I said years ago that we had to get a reliable RB, but given how poor McNair was at RB and the fact Valencia is not our long term solution then I can't understand why Rafael can't get a game. Valencia's attempt at a left-footed cross yesterday should be enough for any manager to rethink whether Rafael should be frozen out of the team.

2738~~~
He hasn't made significant enough contributions worthy of real world recognition except for 2012/13 when he played over 30 games in a season for the first and only time.

Serious question, where would you see him going if we sold him? The only way is down. I could see Arsenal being the only 'elite' team being possibly interested, but he'd struggle even worse with injuries there and fade to obscurity.

2739~~~
Valencia should be our starting RB....been much more reliable than Rafael this year

as for McNair he looked like a CB playing RB yesterday - was infuriating how slow he was to react and when a pass was played to encourage McNair to come forward he let the ball run out of play at times due to his lack of pace

don't get why Rafael wasn't in the side if he wanted to rotate Valencia

2740~~~
Burnley away and City away to name a couple and that's not including performances where he may have been 'solid' but offered absolutely feck all in attack despite that being part of a full backs job.

Valencia can be relied on to do a job, I'm not disputing that, but Rafael is a much better player and it really shouldn't be difficult to see that. When Rafael came in after that Burnley game our right side looked so much better because he provides an attacking threat down that side that Valencia just simply doesn't. Makes a lot of difference especially when we play with no proper wingers and there is so much space there to exploit.

2741~~~
When he came back we beat QPR 4-0 and he played well and he wasn't tested at all. After that we lost to Leicester and he gave away a soft penalty. Vardy had the beating of him in that game. Next two were West Ham and Everton. 

He played well against West Ham and struggled against Everton. So thats only two games where he played well (next two were West brom 2-2, poor game from him and 1-1 Chelsea. He got bad ratings for those games before getting injured again) Also, when I watched him play this season I saw a player who doesn't even look up when he crosses. Evra was a bigger threat in attack.

2742~~~
The folly of it all, is that once LVG's new right-back gets injured, the style of play down the right flank shall have to revert to what we are seeing at present. Were we to keep Rafael there would at least be the potential for some consistency in the role. 


He is doing a good job by the standards of his ability as a fullback, that isn't the same as actually being what the team requires during a crucial run-in. To persevere with Tony would certainly epitomise an Gaal's tenure though, erring on the side of caution when the moment calls for his team to be instinctive and bold about its football. Valencia can be relied upon to provide some defensive solidity when compared to McNair, but neither are a patch on Rafael when fulfilling their offensive responsibilities. 

Considering the amount of time that Rafael has spent on the sidelines free from injury, i shouldn't wonder if the half the squad have a worse rate of ailments this season.

Now i'm not saying that Rafael should have waltzed back into the team easy as you please, however the best natural right-back on the books isn't even being given the opportunity to compete for the place.

2743~~~
I really can't understand any "footballing" reasons why Rafael should be frozen out considering our alternatives are Valencia and McNair.

2744~~~
It was no penalty at all, soft or otherwise. If you can't recognise even that, and hold him culpable irrespective of hindsight, how objective are you judgements on the matter in general?

2745~~~
He actually offered a threat down the right against QPR. He may not have had to do much defensive work but going forward he was good. Valencia actually came on that game and pretty much stifled the attack every time he got the ball. And it's pretty desperate to hold the penalty at Leicester against him seeing as it wasn't a penalty. Also most of Vardy's threat came down the left side. As for the West Brom and Chelsea games, where he was decent/good, if you are using those ratings as a sign of being poor then Valencia has been poor since the Liverpool game.

Maybe you should watch a bit more closely. And Evra is not longer here, he is irrelevant.

2746~~~
Is he that much shorter than Valencia? I have always had the impression he was decent in the air for his height anyway.

2747~~~
Yes if we want to be fighting for the Europa league places

2748~~~
Look at this vid, I know highlights make anyone look good, but to question his football intelligence is very strange. That pass at 0:18, how he sets up Rooney in the City game and the way he waits for it with that through ball to RVP, what a player he was for us that season <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ENu8Z57Apfc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Great technique, great vision, exactly what we've been lacking.

2749~~~
Except Fergie's last year, Rafa has rarely been top. I don't miss him defensively to be honest. This season he has been average, and last year awful. In a club like Madrid / Bayern / Barca he would have never stayed 8 years

2750~~~
And that is the point!!!!

It's nice to see where are a club where the players can have a long career...but that goes for player like for example Carrick. But players like Rafael, Anderson, Nani or Valencia would never be 6 and more seasons at other top top clubs with too many average seasons.

2751~~~
that's not true at all. he was quite good last season till november, then got injured, came back, was hardly played, got bitten by the Moyes bug. Overall, in his early season appearances he did well.

This season, he played well when he got a chance, giving a new dimension to our attack.

Carrick could also have gone in 2011 or even 2012, when he was mediocre from around 2009 with some absolutely cowardly displays.

Rafael is better than almost anyone you can get in the market, and if Fergie was here he was continued to build on that making him a key focus of our attack like how Evra was.

Nani had contract issues in Fergie's last season and that played havoc.

Anderson - yes

Valencia - should have gone in the summer of 2013, but that was only one year of poor performances after being voted the player of the year the previous season. He is still rated high because of his physique and pace, so still playing around and contributing to our poor play keeping out the likes of Nani and Rafael

2752~~~
Surely after McNair's performance Rafael will get a chance in the squad at least.

2753~~~
Rafael did not play for the U21s yesterday, so hopefully he will play on Saturday.

2754~~~
Consistency? 

I love the little fella but I really don't see the point in picking him for a couple of games coming back from fitness (which he lasts 65-70mins) only for him to get injured and miss another 5 weeks. It's a waste of a substitution. 

It's his last season, time to move on from these fragile players who screw up the match rythum of the 1stXI

2755~~~
Rafael should leave for his own good and make a fresh start somewhere else. He isn't going to make much of an impact while LVG is here.

2756~~~
Rhythm?

LvG has hardly been consistent in picking a settled team. I'm not sure why point fingers at Rafael. He is the best player in his position at the club, and when fit should be playing.

2757~~~
We have won 3 Premier League titles with him playing RB and were unlucky to lose on goal difference on another. The guy is excellent, the best fullback at the club. We need him back in the team he's a great attacking outlet and has a great delivery. He's one of few players who seem to genuinely love the club and play with his heart.

2758~~~
The way he's been treated the club will lose a class player on a free.

2759~~~
Good riddance

2760~~~
Oh give me a break. We won 3 EPL titles because we had Rio-Vidic-Evra in defense, 3 quality and DEPENDABLE defenders who wouldn't vanish in the treatment room every 4 games. The Da Silva injury record was well known and forced SAF to move young CBs in the RB role which may have had a negative impact on their career progression.

I can't blame LVG for giving up hope on Rafael. He's good but he's not for the long haul here and its more appropriate to give match experience to players who represent United's future. What I do blame LVG is his reluctance in buying a RB during the January sales. We need one.

2761~~~
He's by far my favourite out of the current crop.

There aren't any.

2762~~~
We'd lose a good but totally unreliable and undependable player for free. We wouldn't even make more than 7M for him anyway.

2763~~~
Not on the bench again. He didn't play the last U21 game as well, is he injured?

2764~~~
He's 100% gone in the summer. Farewell Rafael.

2765~~~
Just completely frozen out. Shocking from LVG.

2766~~~
Yep. It's unbelievable that McNair gets in the squad over him.

2767~~~
But we don't know what goes on behind closed doors!
All the while 33 year old Carrick who has had two long term injuries waltzes back onto the bench. The managers double standards are ridiculous.

2768~~~
I remember there were warnings before LVG took over that he sometimes makes very strange decisions regarding players he likes and ones he doesn't. This is definitely one you can classify under strange. Real shame as I love Rafa.

2769~~~
Depressed. Poor guy, doesn't deserve this.

2770~~~
One of the few players in our squad I feel any sort of an affinity for these days. He's our best option as well, which makes it even more baffling.

The fact that McNair has started games over him is just insulting really.

2771~~~
This is what makes it even sadder for me.

2772~~~
Goodnight sweet prince <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2773~~~
It really does. Objectively speaking someone like Di Maria is much more important to us but I'd rather see him leave than Rafa. 

If it came down to it I'd rather we got rid of Van Gaal to be honest.

2774~~~
Been frozen out because there are other options and he can't be relied on to be fit long term which means if he claims a spot in the team its only a matter of time before he loses it to injury which put a manager who actually seems to want selection consistency and a smaller more adaptable squad back to square one. 

LVG is thinking long term and is making the right decision, Valencia 1st choice RB, Macnair can deputize. 

This isn't mancrush monday this is football.

2775~~~
But this doesn't apply to any of the other sick notes clearly. I'm pretty sure he's been injured less than most players in the squad this season for what it's worth. A couple of weeks unfit at the start and a cheekbone collision, which I'm sure could have even been played through with a Zorro mask a week or two after if we'd wanted him to.

2776~~~
Name those sick notes and i'll bet you their injury record isn't as bad as Rafael Da Silva's.

2777~~~
Phil Jones and Chris Smalling? Hardly reliable are they.

2778~~~
Their record shows they are more reliable than Rafael and I can see any reason to believe that their injury issues are long term. Rafael on the other hand have been their since he joined the club and much like his twin's issues would appear to be genetic IMO.

2779~~~
Could it really be that Van Gaal has something against Brazilian players (as stupid as it sounds)? I think that many people argued for it when he was Barca manager (dunno if it was only because of Rivaldo, or something more) and I really cannot see much reasons why he isn't on the team. Even if he wants Rafael out, surely he could do a job for the remaining game. And him being injury prone is a nonsense reason considering that Jones isn't being punished for that when he is as much - if not more - injury prone than Rafael.

My favorite player but it is clear that he won't be here after ths season. I just hope that he doesn't get demotivated and manages to resurrect his career.

2780~~~
That is fecking stupid to say that.

Plus Rafael wasn't missed today. Valencia was great.

2781~~~
LVG  applauded his character when he broke his cheek but wanted to keep playing.

What has happened?

I'm going to convince myself LVG is saving Rafael for the run in or else I will cry like a little girl.

2782~~~
Carrick didn't play though. We've only got 2 defensive midfielders so he was there just in case Blind got injured. 

McNair can play as a rightback or centreback if one got injured. 

Rafael is fit, he's just been left out. He should of got a red card in his last u21's match vs Everton and wasn't great either, this probably doesn't help his case.

2783~~~
Would you mind actually quantifying this ghastly injury record which you believe him of having this season? 

If you are referring the frequency of injuries since August, Valencia has more to his name; if you are concerned about his <b>4-6 week</b>s of ailments, players in pretty much every position on the pitch have spent either an equal or greater time on the sidelines.

2784~~~
No and you know it. Rafael isnt his type of player. Brazilians generally dont suit his philosophy, has nothing to do with them being Brazilian, but more with their playing style and adaptability. They just have a different way of playing, so i dont see van Gaal keeping him if he isnt even on the bench.

2785~~~
Where do you guys think Rafael will end up ? I can see him going to Valencia/Sevilla in the summer then ending up in somewhere like Barca..

2786~~~
Well yeah, that was what I meant. Be it attitude, them being less tactically adaptable or being more direct than how Van Gaal wants him players to be. Whatever it is.

I just searched in google 'does Van Gall hates Brazilians' and I found this:
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/12/spain/2010/06/01/1952469/louis-van-gaal-is-the-hitler-of-brazilian-players-brazilian" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.goal.com/en/news/12/spai...-is-the-hitler-of-brazilian-players-brazilian</a>

He also pushed Lucio (the captain/vice captain) out immediately after he went to Bayern. Is there a pattern?

2787~~~
I have heard that same rumor before. He also had issues with Giovanni and Lucio.

2788~~~
Well yes then in terms of football style. Doesnt count for every Brazilian though. I could imagine a more non typical Brazilian player having success under van Gaal.

2789~~~
He hates French players too because he didn't like Ribery. Must have pushed Evra out too.

Damn you LVG.

2790~~~
Rafa's of my favourite players at the club, but Valencia is simply the better option. Tony has the advantage of being able to play as a right back, right wing back, right winger or even central midfielder which really shouldn't be underestimated as a deciding factor considering the fact that LVG thinks it is important to be able to switch between systems mid-game.

2791~~~
I'd argue that Rafa is the better option all day tbh. Valencia is quicker and that is probably the only attribute I'd give him over Rafael.

Anyways, thanks for the memories Rafael and good luck in your next club.

2792~~~
I wouldn't bother looking at this season in isolation as you have 5 or more injury interrupted seasons with which to reach such a conclusion. His overriding issues must be well known by the medical staff at this point and I refuse to believe it is just bad luck. I also have little doubt that a coach as meticulous as LVG will have the background on all the players fitness in the squad and would be privy to Da Silva's injuries and the reasons behind them.

It looks to be that which has made up LVG mind, but frankly Rafael also isn't anywhere near as good a FB as many on here believe, Valencia will make a better RB short term and there is better more robust and positional sound RB's out there if we look hard enough.

2793~~~
You would overlook the data which makes your earlier assertions a nonsense? <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/> Hm, interesting.

He's not managed such thus far.

2794~~~
My earlier assertion was that a decision seems to have been made that he is injury prone and unlikely to be able to complete a season without some sort of injury cropping up to disrupt game time and rhythm that assertion was based on not just this season but the past 5 seasons as it would be both harsh and ridiculous to look at somebody's injury record over just one season and suggest they are injury prone on that basis alone. You wanted to limit the analysis to one season, I haven't at any point even though you can find plenty of evidence from the past few seasons to suggest that if he had started more games this season he would have picked up more injuries than he currently has.

He has looked good and solid in the role and will continue to get better if left there, the whole point being that he is likely to be able to be left there for a couple of games due to his superior injury record and he will be better long term due to his superior defensive capabilities.

2795~~~
From 2012/13 through to the present, his injury record has been acceptable in two out of the three seasons.

And as for this:
How on earth would Van Gaal be able to field a team if operating under such a criteria?


Is this now a club that has abandoned some of its attacking traditions?

2796~~~
Not going to read some of the daft arguments being made, especially if it revolves around the idea that Valencia is a better <i>defensive</i> option than Rafael.

2797~~~
That's BS, and you can try to restrict it to the last 2 or so seasons, my criteria for judging that his time here might be up is based on his 5 seasons here. during that time his record is thus:

2008-2009 apps 28
2009-1010 apps 16
2010-2011 apps 28
2011-2012 apps 18
2012-2013 apps 40
2013-2014 apps 28
2014-2015 apps 9

Consider that he has only completed above 30 games in only 1 of those seasons, all of which baring this season we were in Europe. Now think about it carefully when you talking about a club that plays a 38 game domestic season and at least expects to add 6 European ties plus a fair few cup games. Is that really what you would consider to be acceptable?

I should have added niggling to that sentence but the answer to your question is easily, by balancing both risk based on history and judgement based on talent. Da Silva is neither robust enough to take the risk of trying to make him a mainstay in a side where you are looking to be able to make consistent selections, nor his talent such that we could not look to buy better this summer. In the meantime there are better options even in the current squad, hence Valencia starting.


That MO for the way we play is changing and we should no longer expect to be as cavalier as we were at times under SAF. You can't expect to have a new manager come in and try to play with the same principles nor try to do so and succeed on anywhere near the same level as SAF. We have for at least the last 2-3 seasons been pretty weak in both FB positions (with Evra's decline making the LB spot one we should have reinforced sooner than this summer) I respect LVG greatly for casting aside sentimentality and doing what needs to be done. He needs to play his own way and that doesn't mean the death of attacking football, it does mean we will be a more pragmatic side than we were under SAF and in trying to make us more that kind of side the RB slot is a really good place to start with changes.

2798~~~
I think the only reason Rafael is being left out of the team is...injuries? I don't know, I have no idea why he's being left out like this. He's defensively more reliable than 98% of the right backs in football. He's as good going forward as any world class right back. What is it about Rafeal that makes him not even get past a right wing back in Valencia? Is it his injury issues?

2799~~~
Brainfarts, rashness, petulance, inconsistency and inability to stay fit. Valencia is the opposite so its fairly obvious why he gets the nod. If we want to ever get to the stage where we can field a consistant back 4 week after week then Valencia is the one of the 2 we need to persevere with.

2800~~~
Also this.

2801~~~
Out of those descriptions, the only ones I'd agree with are "inability to stay fit" and "inconsistency" (in a way). He's been less rash than many full backs that others rate, and the "brainfarts" and "petulance" was something he showed before he matured. When he's played regularly, he's been consistently great. However, when injuries occur, he becomes more inconsistent, which is understandable given that he never gets going.

Yes, Valencia is reliable in that he follows instructions to the point and you know what he brings to the table every match. However, he doesn't have the quality in his game that Rafael has. Valencia is very reliant on his physical traits when defending, unlike Rafael, who's very good at marking players and positioning himself, defensively. Going forward, Valencia has improved under van Gaal, but he's still very ponderous, unlike Rafael, who's quicker on the ball and has possesses more variety and quality in his attacking game.

2802~~~
Valencia has been more foul prone than Rafael this season.

2803~~~
He plays the game far too close to the edge for Van Gaals liking. Far too prone to picking up silly early bookings, and losing concentration in a game usually against top sides and costing us a goal. Add to that his inability to stay fit and its a no brainer.

You're also overrating his ability on the ball. His attacking game is as an overlapping fullback that played his best football with Valencia/Nani infront of him. As unexciting as Valencia is he offers a more complete allround package than Rafael does.

He's a work in progress as a fullback but he's improving all the time. Theres no doubt Rafael is the more rash of the 2 and that Valencia has the far better temperament.

2804~~~
I can agree with you about him being a bit too aggressive for van Gaal, but then again, when you look at the other full backs out there, I can only name Carvajal, Ivanovic, Lahm, Piszczek, Juanfran, and Darmian who are less "on the edge" than Rafael is. Full backs nowadays are very aggressive in their game, and Rafael isn't even as aggressive as your average good full back (Coleman, Clyne, Zabaleta, etc.).

Also, I don't seem to recall him costing us against top teams unless you count him failing to stop Drogba from scoring against us at a corner. The last time he really cost us in a match against a top team was against Bayern in 2010 with his petulance and rashness in full display. Since then, he's done a great job against the likes of Bale, Hazard, C. Ronaldo, and many more great attacking players.

Again, the only thing that he has against him is his inability to stay fully fit. The "rashness" argument can only be fair if there's a full back available who's less rash than Rafael and better, defensively, but at the moment, I just don't see such a right back.

2805~~~
Why shouldn't we use the most relevant data to reach a conclusion? If Rafael has been capable of 35-40 appearances over a three year period (with the other jsut shy of 30), then not only is it indicative of a generally positive trend but put a sizeable hole in the argument of his supposed "unreliability".


That is either false, as demonstrated above, or entirely your subjective assessment of a player's worth to the team. 


*cough* Van Persie *cough*

2806~~~
If we stick to playing wide player then rafa should be our right back

2807~~~
Antonio Valencia, and he's only been playing the position 6 months.

Did well against Bale certainly atleast once but Hazard and Ronaldo both tore him a new one the last time he faced them. Its not even just against big teams, check out the goals conceded in the pivotal 4-4 against Everton in 2012, or even the goals conceded in some of his outings this and last season. He's always prone to a lapse of concentration and these inevitably come to the fore when his defending comes under serious scrutiny in games where we're under the cosh. He'll play 2-3 games looking world class then he'll let himself down with indiscipline or a defensive lapse, or get injured. An ongoing cycle.

2808~~~
You may think that Valencia's a better right back, defensively, but he's too reliant on his speed, strength, and aggression. He can get away with that against players who rely on their speed, strength, and aggression, like Bolasie, Sagbo, Wickham, etc., but I won't see Valencia doing well against players like Hazard, Sanchez, Bale, or C. Ronaldo.

Rafael contained Hazard in our last match bar the one moment he slipped through in the second half. Hazard wasn't even a threat at all in that match thanks to Rafael. In our last 2 matches against Real Madrid, C. Ronaldo's telling impact came when he didn't face Rafael, and when he did, Rafael did a great stop at nullifying his attacking threat. At Old Trafford, C. Ronaldo only had a telling impact once we went down to 10 men.

And in terms of him making mistakes, I did acknowledge that he is inconsistent, but that's mostly been due to his injury issues and not because he's naturally inconsistent. Look at the 2012/13 season. He was fit for almost the full season, and as a result, he was our best player behind van Persie. There was no inconsistency that season from him.

2809~~~
Hazard? You mean the 1-1 this season. Despite Rafael being on a booking from early in the game he completely nullified Hazard. The one significant contribution Hazard made was when he drifted centrally running through the centre of United's defence just before Drogba's goal. When did Ronaldo tear him a new one?

2810~~~
That's not relevant data, thats one whole season in 5 where he has been able to start above 30 games and the other 4 he hasn't and as I mentioned before I don't believe the problem is bad luck and see no reason to believe it will get better over time, LVG seems to have reached the same conclusion, albeit that I might be wrong about his reasons and he has simply decided that Rafael isn't good enough purely in terms of quality and there is enough evidence to support that conclusion as well.

Its is clearly true as demonstrated by 5 seasons worth of data where he has only once played more than 30 games, do keep up! Also my "subjective" assessment of the player concerned seems to be being backed up by LVG's assessment and his at the end of the day is the only opinion that really counts, my point all along has been that regarding RB I can see exactly where he is coming from by not selecting Rafael.

*Cough* Our second highest scorer *cough* you sometimes have to play top strikers into form *cough* A goal could be all it takes to get him going *cough* he will probably be gone at the end of the season.

2811~~~
Forgot that he played against Hazard this season but that was typical him getting booked in the first 15 minutes for a foul on Hazard and walking a tightrope all game.

Rafael had a shocker against Madrid away in 12-13. Was tore apart in the first half but recovered a bit better in the second. I remember the ridicule Fergie got for saying Rafael would stop Ronaldo.

2812~~~
I don't ever remember Rafael being torn apart in that match. Sure, he didn't fully contain C. Ronaldo, but in no way was he torn apart. He actually had a great performance against him even in the first half.

2813~~~
Everyone wanted him subbed off at HT for Cleverley, he was all over the shop against Ronaldo. He was better in the 2nd half.

2814~~~
Really? I didn't notice anything like this in the newbies at that time. I, myself, was very happy with Rafael in the first half, and he was immense in the second half.

2815~~~
Hazard is the best winger in the league by a long way. He is a phenomenal player and Rafael completely nullified him. Who cares if he got a booking?

I actually don't remember Ronaldo destroying him but even if he did, there's no shame in that. Ronaldo is the best player in the world. Rafael isn't the best right back in the world. The point is that he's the best right back at United and should always play when fit. Being outplayed by Ronaldo in one game doesn't change that.

2816~~~
Do you believe that two minor injuries since August represent a severity of complaint sufficient to preclude Rafael from the majority of matches over half a year?

I certainly do not, which means that he has been capable of well over 30+ games twice, not once. 


I too can envisage such a reason, i would venture to guess that footballing style may be the clash here.   


Neither of which refutes the case for sentimentality on the part Van Gaal, not where RVP is concerned.

2817~~~
Why would I be looking at just this season and the last for evidence of a problem with injuries when I have 5 years worth of data that tells me all I need to know?

As for your second point it is not backed up by any evidence, can you show me where in the 5 years he has completed a 30 + game season more than once? If you can't I am inclined to believe that you are making things up as you go along. The stats I posted even showed that on the one occasion he completed a 40 game season (the only time he reached over 30 games a season in his entire 5 or so years playing career with us.) He then took a backward step by completing only 28 games the following season, which in itself is characteristic of his career with us as its been one step forward and two steps back all the way. The stats would suggest to me that the one time he was able to complete above 30 games a season was a blip and shows no sign of upward trend in terms of him getting used to the physical demands needed to play consistently at this level without picking up niggly injuries. They also suggest that had he started more games he would most likely by now be injured again and the only reason he is currently still fit is because he isn't starting premiership games, because if you look at the incidents of him picking up injuries during actual games its quite high, therein lies the biggest reason why it would be the correct decision to look at other options for first choice RB this summer.


I'd say it is down to lack of quality and reliability rather than a clash of styles but you can phrase it that way if you like.

All of it does actually as it makes perfect sense to continue to play a striker into form when that player can on his day can be the biggest difference between a win and a draw or defeat. RVP was still one of the best strikers on display at the world cup last year so going on reputation alone rather than any emotional attachment or sentiment it is the right thing to do in the case of a striker with RVP's track record, because as with all strikers it only takes 1 goal sometimes to reawaken their goal scoring instincts.

History is full of strikers who were on goal droughts for whom their managers simply decided to continue to give them the opportunity to get out of that hole by scoring goals, it is nothing to do with sentiment and everything to do with understanding that form with striker is all about confidence as opposed to Rafael's situation where it could be said that he plays in a position which is all about the ability to build an understanding with the players around him by playing consistently alongside them, hence the problem.

2818~~~
Rafael struggled in the first leg against Madrid but, it was understandable because he was playing against Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney was playing on the right wing that match and he offered him no help.

2819~~~
On the bench at least. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2820~~~
He's aliveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

2821~~~
One thing that hasn't been mentioned for a while as nothing came of it was the whole bog blowjob thing, maybe it was Raf getting head and he's been punished for it, tonight marks the end of the punishment.

2822~~~
He will only get injured if he comes on.

2823~~~
His best game for a long time

2824~~~
Our manager is a moron. Sanchez was roasting Valencia down the left and our one competent RB was sitting on the bench.

2825~~~
Why on earth are we playing a limited player out of position when we have a talented young right back festering on the fecking bench?

2826~~~
If there's anything positive we can take out of that match, hopefully it's the possibility of Rafael getting a start.

2827~~~
Same line of thinking for me. Valencia was shown up drastically. Rafa may be back in the frame now.

2828~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/O9ugAz3ue0h/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

Just scored...

Best player on the field so far against Tottenham. Really hope Van Gaal utilises him in the next few weeks.

2829~~~
It is just sad seeing him in u-21 matches.

2830~~~
Van Gaal doesn't see what we see. Most fans thought the first half last night was great, Van Gaal thought we needed two changes. Most fans think Rafael is the best right back at United, Van Gaal though...

2831~~~
What a goal that is.

2832~~~
Pretty ridiculous if he don't start next game.

2833~~~
Our manager, confidence booster or honesty, said Valencia was our best player. He's going nowhere.

Shame he isn't in the side. One of the very few players at this club I have some fondness for. You can tell he loves the shirt. 

An exciting player that can't get in a boring team.

2834~~~
It'll be his fitness problems which perhaps make LVG reluctant to play him. I quite like him and think he's comfortably a better right back than Valencia, and if he stays fit then he could still have some potential, but it's looking unlikely he's going to get a lot of playing time at the moment.

2835~~~
Great goal. Didn't see the game but that goal alone displayed more technical ability than Valencia has shown in the last 3 years.

Could easily play the two of them with Valencia on the wing to track back. But probably won't.

2836~~~
He was so much better than everyone else on the pitch, he deserves a chance.

2837~~~
Quality goal but LvG's post match comments last night suggest he's a Tony V forever man.

2838~~~
Watched the whole game, he absolutely tore that right flank down. Great deliveries, great speed, one touch overlaps and was defensively solid. I know it's only U21's but he looked phenomenal.

He could have easily had 4/5 assists if the finishing and movement was better, have to say Peirera was excellent too.

Giggs was watching the match and hopefully he'll sneak a word in to LvG.

PS: That Rafael goal was with his weaker foot...

2839~~~
Man, I miss him. It's incredible how much better he is attacking wise than Valencia.

2840~~~
Why cause he can score a goal against an U21 side ?
The manager doesnt rate him.

2841~~~
Because he was MOTM in the match, and our current RB was directly at fault for 2 goals in our last loss.

2842~~~
Better manager than LvG had him playing that role for a number of years. Our best only right back.

2843~~~
No he wasnt, Jones should have thrown his head to that ball rather than stick out a leg and try control it.

2844~~~
Its very easy to put a weak player in the team when you have very good defenders VDS,Vidic,Ferdinand and Evra in the team to cover his mistakes.

2845~~~
A weak player? Okay then.

2846~~~
I said in the matchday thread, but I am quite surprised that LVG doesnt see fit to even give Rafael a chance. Valencia hasnt been anything special, you would think that Rafael might get a <i>bit</i> of gametime - even just some sub appearances.

To not give him any gametime whatsoever just seems a bit off, even for a "doesnt rate him" situation. Furthermore it means that if/when we do ship Rafael out, we will likely get a meagre fee for him (£5m max?) - if we are planning on selling him we should at least try to put him in the shop window a bit.

2847~~~
Wow!

As if Sir Alex would play weak players purposely...

2848~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2849~~~
When does his contract end?

2850~~~
no white text?

2851~~~
2016

2852~~~
I don't mind Valencia starting ahead of him, as he played well when Rafael was injured. However McNair? LVG taking the piss tbh

2853~~~
Apparently he doesn't like flair/risk takers at the back. 

Philosophy, get with it!

2854~~~
Except he bought Rojo....

2855~~~
I bet the actual number of games he's been unavailable for this season is really small.

2856~~~
IIRC, he's hardly dribbled or ventured forward since his first few games.

2857~~~
What pisses me off more than him not playing, even though he's the best RB we have, is that we're going to show him the door and spend near 30 Million to buy someone else when we just don't have to. It's up for debate whose better, but take your pick between Clyne or Coleman and the only major selling point is their injury record vs Rafael's. But if that's the case we might as well sell half our team if that's the reason for replacing players. And there's no guarantees that they stay fit either. Luke Shaw was a constant in Southamptons XI and look what's happened.

2858~~~
Well,we didn't exactly have too many natural right backs to choose from..

2859~~~
Our transfer policy has been a shambles since Sir Alex and Gill left.

2860~~~
We didn't need too many! He was deemed good enough.

2861~~~
Valencia looked like a fish out of water, and it looked like Arsenal targeted him with Sanchez running at him. i don't blame Valencia though, I blame the manager. The warning signs were there before Arsenal scored. LVG didn't do feck all to stop it. Why not? I really want to know!!

2862~~~
Yeah or Maybe there was "no value in the market" for a right back <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

2863~~~
In all honesty, I feel as if LVG just doesn't rate him. This inability to stay fit non-sense if spouting by posters who don't know feck all. If that were true then the likes of Jones or Smalling wouldn't walk right back into the side the moment the become fit again.

It's nonsense spouted by people who just don't rate Rafael. LVG clearly thinks he's not good enough or else he would play, thats one of LVG's most glaring mistakes if I'm being totally honest.

The lad is still the best fullback at the club.

Edit - Even Shaw has been finding it difficult to stay fit, but that doesn't stop him from starting at LB the moment he is available.

2864~~~
Have you already forgotten how often Fergie played Jones or Smalling ahead of Rafael at right back? Did he have a problem with flair too? Come on, you're better than this.

2865~~~
Rafael was a young player, sometimes injured, Jones and Smallkng needing game time also, years ago it was often about rotation with them at RB as they needed to play with Rio, Vidic and Evans playing at CB.

Rafael was Fergie's RB, it was just at a time where he had to mix it around.

2866~~~
You can't just compare it like for like though. Jones and Smalling go straight back in after injury because there is no else there to play. One of Jones, Smalling, and Evans have to play, all of which are injury prone. Shaw as well, there is no replacement for him. His back-ups are Rojo and Blind who van Gaal and everyone prefers at CB and CM. Rafael however has Valencia who never gets injured and van Gaal clearly rates. There is someone there to take Rafael's spot whereas there just isn't anyone there to take Smalling, Jones or Shaw's spots. 

I've gotten sick of his injuries but I still think he is better than Valencia and he hasn't been fit for a month now in which I would have liked to see him played.

2867~~~
It was already shite, when they were around.

2868~~~
Valencia is more disciplined than rafa. Hes less of a loose canon. not saying i agree but lvg loves solid disciplined players. Valencia didn't show it monday night but rafaels flair and aggression has cost him his place in my opinion.

2869~~~
Rafael was always his first choice when available.

I read on a recent thread on LvG's philosophy by a Dutch poster he does not permit risks/flair at the back. I can't think of any other reason why he doesn't get game time despite not having a right-back in the squad.

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/louis-van-gaals-tactics.402215/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/louis-van-gaals-tactics.402215/</a>

2870~~~
Glad he played well. Really hope he gets one more chance before the end of the season.

2871~~~
Rojo is more prone to moments of extreme risk than Rafael. 

This is all idiocy. We're not talking about Rafael being dropped for a less risky RB but almost as good competitor. He's been dropped for an out of position winger.

2872~~~
He played very well last night but I think people overreacted over it.Herrera,Carrick also dominated the game when they play down and McNair looks like Carlos in his last U21s game as a right back.Still I reckon Valencia would still look average if he did have to play down.

2873~~~
I'll mention it again, maybe he was the one getting the filmed blowjob in the toilets? That might explain why he has been treat as he has, punishment. As far as LvG not liking risk takers at the back, that seems hard to imagine given he's regularly picked Jones and Rojo, both of whom are always near a moment of rashness.

2874~~~
It was worse.

2875~~~
No he wasn't. Surely you can remember all the moaning on the many occasions he was dropped for Jones or Smalling? It was a regular occurrence. 

For a manager who allegedly won't permit risks/flair at the back did it occur to you how often Young and Valencia (former wingers) have played at fullback when we've almost never seen central defenders asked to play that position* (something Fergie often did)



* Rojo being the only exception but he's as much of a fullback as he is a centre half.

2876~~~
As I mentioned earlier, I think you have to look at that RB/Rafa/Jones/Smalling situation more in depth rather than a player didn't play = they were dropped. All young players, fitness issues, needing games etc. I would bet my right nut that if you asked Fergie who his best option at RB was, it would have been Rafael without question.

2877~~~
To be fair Sir Alex also said that Jones might go on to be the best United player ever.

Rafael is by far, the best right back we have. This isn't even debatable.

2878~~~
All those potential reasons were discussed to death at the time. Probably the only time Fergie himself gave a reason was when he said he wanted more height in defence.

2879~~~
He was unquestionably first choice, Fergie just opted for the extra height in certain games. 

I cant believe any united fan believes Valencia is a better choice than Rafa, some just want to support the manager over every little issue and its absurd.

2880~~~
It's really very simple. Rafael was poor for most of last season (which Giggs will have told Van Gaal) was a bit hit and miss when he's played this season, got injured, then Valencia's done very well in his absence and hasn't deserved to be dropped.

Personally, I'd like to see Valencia <b>and</b> Rafael play on our right flank. That's been our best combination in recent years. Valencia and Di Maria doesn't work well at all, as Di Mari doesn't seem to know or care enough to defend. Rafael and Di Maria together would be an utter disaster.

2881~~~
he was quite good till November, the only player who seemed not to be affected by Moyes apart from Rooney, then he got injured and he got bitten by the bug which bit the rest of the team. You can't be taking last season as a barometer of anything as apart from Rooney, Januzaj and De Gea, no one comes out of it well and even if that was the case Valencia should be no where near the team

And Valencia has been clogging up the right-flank, without adding anything in attack. The last time Rafael played, our play down the right-side was transformed.

Do you really believe what you are saying or you are trying to make a case for LvG and defend his actions

2882~~~
There was a poster on here who claimed to know which players were there the night that supposedly occurred. They could probably confirm if Rafael was there or not. The idea does make sense but it is just complete guess work based on no real fact or evidence. Just as likely, if not more, that van Gaal just doesn't like his style of play.

2883~~~
What game are you thinking of?

2884~~~
Ultimately this comes down to the fact that loads of people on here either can't or won't understand why Valencia is so highly rated by his manager. And that's not something that started when Van Gaal took over. Was the same under Moyes and Fergie before him. 

You have to ask yourselves, when three different managers evidently have such a different opinion to you about the same player maybe you're missing something about his game that professional football managers are better qualified to pick up on than you?

I like Rafael. He's a great character and, on his day, a great fullback. However he's struggled for form and fitness these last two seasons (his last really good season being the only one in his United career where he stayed fit - this is not a coincidence). In his absence, Valencia has come in and done a very good job and retained his place on merit. It really is that simple. If/when he gets injured or has a dip in form I'm sure Rafael will get games again. I hope he plays well enough to keep Valencia out of the team. Time will tell.

2885~~~
But Fergie and Moyes rated him as a winger, not a fullback (where they preferred Rafael).

2886~~~
That's irrelevant to my point in that Fergie and Moyes picking him over more popular players prompted the same baffled disbelief on here.

Like I said, when three different top flight managers see something in a footballer that you don't, chances are you're the one missing something, not them.

The same applies in reverse. When you get players that managers don't rate as highly as people on here, then chances are they see flaws that casual fans might overlook. Kagawa being a classic example.

2887~~~
I don't think the question should be Rafael or Valencia here. Play them both and lets get some consistency down that right hand side

2888~~~
You may be right there, but I think its more about Valencia attitude and workrate rather than his ability.... I think managers can trust Valencia to do the job for the position.

2889~~~
Fair enough, I didn't realise it was a broader discussion; assumed it was specific to the Rafa vs Val debate.

2890~~~
He needs to start when fit, simple as that really. Valencia can do a job when he is not fit, that is maybe a bit cynical view when you think about Valencia's decent performances, but he is not as good as Rafael.
I really miss the guy, would rather see the back of LvG than him.

Knee-jerk? Yes, but the absence of Rafa and how this season is going is all very frustrating.

2891~~~
I think the biggest Rafael fans would admit it took him until 2011 / 2012 time find a real consistency to his game. But since then he has been putting in performances at a level that I haven't seen from a United right back, since Neville's prime. He was first choice both under Ferguson in his later years and Moyes last season, the only thing that was changing that was injuries.

Rafael just adds an urgency to our team, I've said this earlier in the thread but we are a better side with him in it - that's even true this season (I think we've played our best football in Sept/Oct) despite him barely playing.


Valencia has done okay but just lacks the defensive nous, you can't blame him at all as he's being played out of position. But he has cost us goals this season on top of some crucial goals last season purely down to basic defensive errors in positioning and not being aware of what is around him. I do think he deserves to keep his starting place but lets move him forward and reunited him with Rafael on the right wing.

2892~~~
Yeah, I think that's a big part of it. I also think they like the fact his passing and touch is extremely consistent (well, up until that woeful pack pass the other day anyway!) as well as being very fit, strong, quick across the ground and competitive. Plus his concentration is usually excellent and I presume he's dilligent at following the managers instructions, whatever they might be. All of this might not catch the eye but it's the sort of thing that managers (and team-mates) really appreciate.

2893~~~
I'd like to see that too.

2894~~~

2895~~~
Luckhurst seems to really dislike Valencia (just what I have seen over his last few tweets). What he said is probably correct though.

2896~~~
That's a bit of a pathetic, snidey tweet tbh.

2897~~~
I've seen numerous from him in the same vein. One of those that by being over critical and cutting, thinks he's telling it like it is. A bit like Scholes.

2898~~~
Reminds me of that knob-head, Daniel Harris through most of the last few years of Fergie's reign.

2899~~~
He's right though, Valencia wouldn't try that in a million years. Probably why LVG rates him so highly.

2900~~~
Brilliant goal. Weaker foot as well. Its a bad indictment on Van Gaal if he frowns upon that kind of thing, to me. Furthermore, it's not as if Rafael's a worse defender than Valencia.

2901~~~
By that logic Rafael should be playing as two managers have favoured him in that position to Valencia.

The fact Valencia played a lot on the wing under Fergie and a little under Moyes doesn't have any relevance to the debate on who should start there. 

For a start players deteriorate, Valencia was an excellent replacement to Ronaldo and served his purpose as a pacey winger very well. He's still a subpar right back

2902~~~
He frowns upon shooting at goal? I suspect not.

2903~~~
He's not a subpar right back. He's been a very good rightback in almost every game he's played this season. Moyes and Fergie both played him at fullback occasionally when he didn't really impress but the run of games this season has seen him develop into a very good fullback. One of our most consistent and relable performere in a season where very few players have been reliable. If you can't see that, then I understand why our opinions are so different.

2904~~~
He frowns apon a full back being in a position to shoot at goal. I suspect so!

2905~~~
That's just nonsense. Have people forgotten that he managed Philip Lahm?

Anyway, even at United, our fullbacks spend loads of time in the final third. Especially Valencia.

2906~~~
Well he's not wrong.

2907~~~
Eh thats like saying he isnt telling Herrera to become Cleverley because he managed Clarence Seedorf and he took on risky passes....

To suggest our full backs are expected to follow certain rules which kinda hinders them from getting into shooting positions is incredibly likely under his philosophy.

2908~~~
A lot of non-United fans seem to share LVG's opinion of Rafael. I like him and still think overall he's our best RB, but let's be honest, his injury record is poor and we have to draw a line through that. You simply can't win trophies spending most of the season rehabilitating your back 4. I'd like to see him stay and fight for his place with the RB that is inevitably signed, but even without knowing who we'll buy, it's not a fight I see Rafael winning.

2909~~~
It might be if we accept that he really is "<i>telling Hererra to become Cleverley</i>". Again, I suspect he isn't.

Whatever rules his philosophy might have, you're deluded if you think he would have been anything other than pleased with a fullback shooting in the scenario that Rafael faced. It was a no-brainer. Brilliant execution but of course he had to shoot. Van Gaal wouldn't have wanted him to do anything else.

2910~~~
I'd rather the GBP10-15m go towards bringing in his replacement and having Valencia as back up.

2911~~~
I don't mean shooting at goal. I mean the willingness to go for the riskier option. I don't think Valencia would've even been in that sort of position from an opposition goalkeeper's throw. I don't think you can dispute that Van Gaal has totally frozen Rafael out for whatever reason, and I can't say I agree with that decision. That's not a knock on Valencia's performances this season. I even mentioned how he had a good game against Arsenal, despite his mistakes leading to both the goals.

2912~~~
Different standards or definition of a full back perhaps. 

Hes very good at following the instructions of playing it safe , obv bar his mistake the other day but these things happen. 

He offers nothing going forward and hardly offers a solid presence  at the back except his ability to ram into the back of someone and avoid giving away a foul. 

The way we've been set up all season has put very little pressure on our fullbacks and much more on the centre backs imo

2913~~~
I suspect your right of course but the herrera of today is playing closer to Cleverley's playing style than the Herrera which played against us for Bilbao. I'm just venting anger at his demise dont mind me. I would say this. If he is not under instruction to limit his passing, I'd sell him this summer for his displays. If he is under instruction, I hope the addition of another CM will give him more freedom next year <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2914~~~
True it is guess work, but I think the complete freeze out job makes the guess carry some weight.

I agree with the bulk of the post, I am a huge fan of Rafael's style but I think all 3 managers have had a degree of doubt regarding him, but I think the first sentence misses the mark on why some are so frustrated, it's not just the Raf vs Tony V thing, it's that Raf is being dumped in the U21's while McNair is the back up RB that has so many annoyed.

2915~~~
I know this doesn't fit the narrative, but Valencia has picked up more injuries than Rafael since the start of the season. Save for about 7-10 days he's been available to play since the last week of November i think. 

However if these reports surrounding Van Gaal's training methods are accurate, it could be that Rafael was an early casualty of the philosophy.

2916~~~
I don't dispute that at all. My take on it is that Rafael hasn't been entirely convincing and Valencia made the position his own when Rafael was out injured.

I've got a lot of problems with Van Gaal but one of the few things I like about him is that he seems to pick the team on merit. If someone comes in and does a good job he'll keep picking them until they let him down. With Valencia being so consistent (and resistant to injury) it's been very hard for Rafael to get a game. I think all the stuff about him not fitting in with his "philosophy" is ignoring this very simple reason for Valencia holding down the RB position.

2917~~~
How would Rafael pick up more injuries watching on from the sidelines? Tripping up on his way to the seat!

2918~~~
Good points actually. Never thought of it that way. Then again, what was Van Gaal doing playing McNair in RB ahead of Rafael? Has Rafael really fallen that far down the pecking order?

2919~~~
The McNair thing is odd. Perhaps he's been on the bench instead of Rafael because he can cover two positions if necessary? In terms of starting games he came in and was excellent (against Preston? or was it Cambridge?) then started the next game, was crap, and hasn't been seen since.

Wasn't that also around the time Rafael was recently injured (lacking "match rhythm"?) Anyway, I'd be amazed if Rafael didn't start the next game that Valencia was unavailable. Especially with him looking good for the reserves. If that doesn't happen then I'll accept Van Gaal must <i>really</i> think he's crap.

2920~~~
I don't get this view that we only need to assess his injury record this season. Or this odd idea that it's only muscular injuries that are an issue and things like the broken cheekbone don't count.

2921~~~
We're just past the first week of March and people are using the fact a player has been available "<i>save for about 7-10 days</i>" since the first week of December as evidence that he's not injury prone. Colour me not convinced.

2922~~~
McNair can cover two positions but I am sure there most times he was on the bench ahead of Rafael so was another CB so him being able to play both positions seems a stretch. As a RB McNair has had 2 good games, both against lower league teams in the FA Cup, the second half against Cambridge and the full game against Preston. in the PL the couple of games he's had at RB he's looked out of his depth attacking and defending, but did show an knack for intelligent passing from the role.

I have to confess I am not sure on the exact timeline of Rafael's injury issues but he seems to have been playing in the U21's for a couple of months now and the injury he had was a facial one as opposed to the type that would stop a player keeping their full training regime, and LvG's match rhythm seems to only apply when it suits him, I mean Blind returned from a nasty knee injury straight into the starting lineup.

2923~~~
Yeap. I was thinking this when Blind returned. We're Manchester United (the club that was run by an autocracy for close to 3 decades) fans, I think most of us would accept that the manager will want to make decisions based on his own whims or gut feelings. I preferred how Ferguson did things, without any bullshit scientific type waffling about why he'd make decisions. Doesn't help when you contradict your words with your actions.

2924~~~
But it really isn't that simple. When Valencia needed to be rotated he chose McNair at right back instead of Rafael. I cannot speak for others but I can absolutely understand why he likes Valencia. Van Gaal's full backs play far higher up the pitch than normal full backs and one of Valencia's greatest strengths is his ability to shield and keep the ball under pressure. He is brilliant at it. Van Gaal values possession above all else. I believe he also sees Valencia as a "safer" player.

I just happen to think that he's wrong. In a team that struggles for balance and cannot seem to be both an attacking threat and a competent defensive unit with the same line up, including a full back who is better defensively and more creative than the incumbent appears a no brainer. Also, Rafael's detractors criticise him for giving fouls away and making mistakes. Conceding stupid needless fouls is the biggest flaw in Valencia's game and the goal against Arsenal (given the game, the opposition and the stage of the season) was one of the worst and most costly mistakes by a United defender in many years.

Valencia has some positive features but Rafael is just a significantly better right back.

2925~~~
I remember <a class="username" data-user="69130, @limerickcitykid" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69130/">@limerickcitykid</a> discussing that with someone before. It's not true. Blind was in full training a week or two before he started a first team game.

2926~~~
I know such things don't factor into your thinking Pogue, but there are numerous players with a comparable or worse injury record who nonetheless start matches. The fitness argument simply doesn't hold water, not in isolation. 

It is more plausible that Van Gaal doesn't favour his style of play, or something of that nature. Although even should be his opinion over the long term, he's been cutting off his nose to spite his face with this McNair business.

2927~~~
play him as LB.. could be interesting looking left hand side with two natural "rightfooters" perhaps little bit too much of imbalance for van Gaal tho

2928~~~
Yes training, but Rafael has been training and playing reserve football for 2 months now and hasn't even made the bench, in fact I don't think Rafael missed much training at all with the cheekbone injury.

2929~~~
I'd prefer if he was direct as well, in fact he doesn't even need to give a reason, he simply has to say he can only select 18 players and he'll decide when a player has shown him enough in training for him to put them back in the squad, and that all players recover differently.

2930~~~
Mc Nair's barely played a handful of games at fullback, off the back of excelling in that position for our U-21s. In his debut first team game in that position he was arguably MOTM. He subsequently got dropped after a bad game and hasn't played that position since. 

With all the fuss about losing our emphasis on youth development when Fergie retired I find it very hard to get worked up about the opportunities given to McNair this season. Especially with so few opportunities to give players games.

2931~~~
Didn't Van Gaal say something like "McNair could be the Manchester United right-back for the next ten years"? Hardly surprising he's picking him over Rafael if he rates him that highly....

2932~~~
He was bigging him up after a really good performance against Cambridge. He's been talking up the kids at every chance he gets this season. Youth development seems to be a point of personal pride for him. I wouldn't take everything he says about them entirely seriously.

2933~~~
Seems to enjoying himself at Cheltenham.

Damn, knew I should have nipped over to the racecourse today (I live like 5 mins walk from it)!

2935~~~
Some excellent caption opportunities there.

2936~~~
Just saw a clip of the screamers he has scored for us, think I will probably shed a tear when he leaves. I think winning & losing is a part of sport but it just sucks how hard it is becoming to associate with the current team, I am ready to give the manager time to improve us but it seems like by this time next season almost every single player in the team bar Rooney will be new and bought post Saf leaving.

2937~~~
Most of LvG's 'baffling' decisions, I can maybe make a case for...but this guy's omission at the expense of Valencia is the one that really doesn't make any sense.

He should be playing every game.

2938~~~
I would accept there's no point in playing Rafael in Van Gaal was intent on creating a settled back four. But when he himself makes changes, during matches as well, then I don't see the point. He's our best right back, by far.

2939~~~
He's our only natural right back   <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2940~~~
<a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a>

I disagree mate. 

Rafael is a better right back than Valencia both offensively and defensively, even if we're talking about post 2012/ 2013 or just this current season. eg. Look at his performances vs West Ham or Everton from this season which were as good as his 2012/ 2013 form). 

But that gets overlooked or underrated or forgotten because he has started just 6 games under Van Gaal in the regular season making the sample size minimal. The only thing (IMO) holding him back from being our long term starter is his dodgy fitness record. If we was consistently fit, Valencia wouldn't get a whiff at RB. Therein lies the problem, if he's fit right now, why not just plug him in, instead of persisting with a player who is more suspect in terms of his positional discipline for the role (not that I blame Valencia mind - it's not his natural position).

2941~~~
Clearly still keeping a good attitude which is good to see. I trust he'll still find success somewhere else just wish it could be here. I'm sure we'll spunk another £30 million on someone almost as good though.

2942~~~
So the boss enjoyed his performance and his goal. 
Now who was it saying he wouldn't like to see a fullback doing what Rafael did?

2943~~~
Cool maybe he can actually give him playing time now.

2944~~~
I agree for the most part, but I think Valencia has done really well generally this season. Yes he might frustrate supporters, but is a very reliable player with his overall fitness and physicality. Almost always reliable on the ball as well, to dribble it out of defence and keep the width. It's his final ball that is lacking and the defensive nous that comes with being a natural fullback as you say, but he is very harshly criticized for the most part. Rafael at his best is better, but he needs a run of games to get to his best, and that very rarely happens with his injury record, and so that's just more chopping and changing in the team. It's better to have consistency at the back with Valencia, to form an understanding with the players around him, rather then have the position change every few games because of injuries.

2945~~~
6.2 Average rating
6.6 Your rating

Guess van Gaal thinks otherwise.

2946~~~
Rafael makes the entire right side of the pitch better when he plays. You can't say that about Valencia or Mcnair or any other player thrown in.

2947~~~
Just below Smalling not contesting that Kompany header in theyear City won the league, Rafael getting red carded vs Bayern when we had a path to the finals almost sewn up, and Evans getting sent off for the 6-1 in the year we lose by goal difference... so actually not really. We've had many defenders over the year with brain farts. This game is not less crucial than those were except now we're fighting for the famous 4th place trophy. Riio was one defender who had regular brain farts for a few years when he just came. Jones has had many a costly mare for us too the past 2 years.

I agree Rafael is the better RB when on form, because Valencia though doing very well over the season isn't experienced as a defender, but your argument as to why has flaws in itself given how well he's played bar the last game.

2948~~~
The whole "he'll play him as a wingback" and "LvG only likes safe, boring players" is this seasons "We are gonna buy Osman."

2949~~~
None of those things were anywhere near as bad as Valencia's mistake against Arsenal. Losing a header to Kompany is understandable, Rafael was sent off for some ticky tack fouls and City were already pistol whipping us when Evans was sent off.

2950~~~
Wisely chosen words.  

Rafael is fit and he's got a nice tan.  Play the man at RB!

2951~~~
Interesting what he said about confidence. It's something a lot of people never consider when they are demanding that player X should be playing. He might be having a bit of a tough time of it lately and not training well so the club have lightend the load on him and given him some U21 games to get back into it. 

The fact he hasn't played very well in them up until now says a lot too. 

But no, throw him straight in again, he's our best right back.

2952~~~
He wouldn't strike you as a player that suffers from low confidence but then, you'd never know would you?

2953~~~
He's not one you would think to make his game more conservative as a result of lack of confidence like Valencia did. I think he's possibly suffering from a lack of confidence in the same way Jones does though. They are instinctive players who play at breakneck speed and get stuck in. With confidence and a clear head it can result in excellent performances. 

Short of confidence and with doubt in their mind it can result in poor decision making. They can be caught in two minds about committing or holding off and they might be more prone to do something out of fraustration.

2954~~~
Congratulations. That is the most confusing post I have read on this forum. You agree with the point but not the reasoning? You dispute that it was one of the worst recent errors by mentioning just 3 other examples (none of which were anywhere near as bad) and one of them was from 5 years ago. Even if the others were worse (they weren't) isn't it still one of the worst?

Arsenal are the ultimate confidence team. Gifting them a confidence boosting win when they are big rivals in a run in could be really costly.

I've not been impressed with Valencia at all this season. I really don't know where this idea that he has had a good season has come from. He's suspect defensively, gives away numerous needless fouls and provides no attacking threat.

2955~~~
Being dropped in favour of Valencia and McNair won't have done much for his confidence.

2956~~~
The way he brings the ball forward is an attacking threat and very underrated, it's easy to forget that was what created our goal vs Arsenal as well. It boils down to the fact he's not a natural right back and will look out of his depth positionally in every big game. I'm seething at the mistake for the 2nd goal but that's all it was, it's not a common fault in his game like his lack of awareness of what's behind him, it was just an unfortunate instance that we'll never see again from him.

2960~~~
I wonder if there is any chance that LVG didn't really put Rafael out of the team because he doesn't rate him, but instead if it was a way of managing his injuries. You know, like saying him to take the needed time, became match fit on the reserves, monitorate his progress instead of rushing him on the first team where he would inevitably get injured.

Maybe wishful thinking but it would be great if he'll play (and don't get injured) on the rest of the matches. Because, a fully fit and confident Rafael is a great player and would make us much better.

2961~~~
It seems to be the reality, not wishful thinking. I am sure we will see Rafael playing in the main team soon.

2962~~~
Just curious. Putting Valencia comparisons aside, how do you rate Rafael as a player? IMO his performance level has been consistently high since he's been at the club, last season being the exception when he was a bit shit. Injuries have been the only question mark for me.

2963~~~
Hopefully! It looked quite weird that only after a week or so LVG praised Rafael he decided to not play him again.

2964~~~
The sooner he is in the team the better. We need him for the run in

2965~~~
However he is rated by fans, at the very least he deserves a few more chances to play because there aren't many games left to the end of the season. The way he has been completely frozen from the team is weird to me and this while not rating him highly.

2966~~~
I believe we will finish in the top 4 and to do so, we need to put a run together starting against Spurs and I truly believe that Rafael makes us a far better team. So I am expecting the positive turn around to coincide with Rafael's return.

Now that I have said that, I expect Valencia to take his spot.

2967~~~
He seems injury prone and can be a little rash at times but I really do not understand why he is not a starter and one of our main players. He is so skillful on the ball and can give us a goal at anytime. I wonder if it is a height issue. Maybe we should try him out as an all out winger.

2968~~~
Want him to start tomorrow, our most gifted defender (technically).

2969~~~
Want him to start but I am not letting myself believe. I know I will wake up and see Valencia in the starting XI.

2970~~~
Having not played a PL match for months, it would be utter madness to throw him in for such an important game like todays.

Therefore, I'd imagine thats exactly what LVG will do.

2971~~~
And McNair on the bench.

2972~~~
Putting him on, even for a few minutes, was good man management after the comments of praise this week.

2973~~~
Didn't really do anything but it was nice to see him come on, hoping to see more of him later on.

2974~~~
Kane joked him 2-3 times

2975~~~
Glad he got back on the pitch. Hopefully he can continue to pick-up some minutes here and there.

2976~~~

2977~~~
Was thrilled to see him out there. Great day.

2978~~~
any chance he'll start vs Liverpool?

2979~~~
Dont think he will and dont think we should drop Valencia for that match. (Although I think Rafael is abetter RB). If that makes sense.

2980~~~
I was hoping he'd have come on to take RB and Valencia push up for Mata. Rose was getting quite high up the pitch in the second half and while Mata did his best to cover, always seemed like he was a few steps back. Anyway, glad to see him get a few minutes. Hope he gets at least a game or 3 before the end to convince LVG to keep him next season.

2981~~~
What's the low down on his latest injury then?

2982~~~
Challanged a Leicester player for a high ball and seemes to take a knee into his ribs. Stayed down for a while and went off.

2983~~~
No news on extent so far? Did he walk off (could rule out broken rib if he did).

2984~~~
Maybe his luck is turning!

2985~~~
Not that physical pain is amusing nor would I wish it upon anyone, but I did laugh in disbelief when he had to go off with what the commentators were speculating as a possible broken rib.
Hopefully its just a bruise or something.

2986~~~
People can easily walk with broken ribs unless they're complete weaklings.

Anyway this is why we need a new RB we can't rely on Rafa anymore. He needs to be sold in the summer

2987~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2988~~~
They could but I really do doubt our medical team would let him do it. Just seems precautionary, if this was first team football he might well have played on.

2989~~~
Hull city are waiting

2990~~~
Can't wait for people to talk about how taking a knee to the ribs somehow reinforces the idea that he's injury prone. It's a freak accident that could happen to anyone, not a recurring muscle injury or something like that.

2991~~~
It's sad that he's the only legitimate RB in this club. I really hope it's not a rib.

2992~~~
We already know he's made of glass. The fact doesn't need any reinforcing. That's why we will surely be buying a proper RB in the summer.

2993~~~
Does it really matter at this point whether he's injury prone, accident prone, or just plain unlucky? It seems pretty obvious to me that he isn't being picked at least in part because we can't rely on his availability.

2994~~~
Couldn't agree more. The same with the cheekbone one. They're just unlucky. 

I hope it's nothing too serious.

2995~~~
Do you need any news? He's our only experienced natural right back and he hasn't played even when fully fit. We've also been strongly linked to Clyne and other RBs all season long. Anyone with reason will have to admit its not looking good at all for him at OT.

2996~~~
<a class="username" data-user="19403, @Van Piorsing" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19403/">@Van Piorsing</a> its beginning.

Rafael Da Silva is desperate to stay at <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/Manchester%20United%20FC" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a> , but fears he will be sold this summer.

The Brazilian has failed to win the confidence of manager Louis van Gaal this season and has struggled with niggling injuries in a frustrating season.

But despite being keen to stay at Old Trafford and fight for his place in the United squad, <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the Brazilian is aware that he may have no choice in the matter come July.</a>

Van Gaal is known to be keen on bringing in at least one right-back in the off-season, with Nathaniel Clyne the number one target.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/437617/Liverpool-Chelsea-Southampton-Nathaniel-Clyne-Manchester-United" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/fo...Southampton-Nathaniel-Clyne-Manchester-United</a>

Van Gaal has told Brazil international Rafael da Silva he is no longer part of the club's long-term plans and wants Clyne to replace him.

He has been forced to use winger Antonio Valencia at right back this season and knows he needs a specialist in this position.

I guess you'll have to wait for the BBC or Sky to print the inevitable

2997~~~
Get rid of him asap

2998~~~
Im not even talking about Yeovil. Im talking about Cambridge United 3-0 at OT with McNair at RB for 90 mins and being voted MOTM. He also played in the league for 90 mins against Burnley when we won 3-1 at OT. His little RB run came to end with a halftime sub away to Swansea when we lost 2-1. All that time Rafael was fit and playing for the U-21s. I dont even think McNair is a RB, he should be developed as a CB or his original position as a CM IMO.

2999~~~
I appreciate it man and I know things aren't good for him but still it's nothing definitively confirmed. The season isn't over and he's still our player but with supposedly Rafa going bye bye we really gonna need a new RB, possibly even two of them to fully cover that position. I'm not even sure if Saidy Janko is fully prepared to attack this spot but I do hope we'll see him on the U.S. tour.

The probability is steering towards changes and I can't deny it... especially after today. Someone may send us an offer for him very soon.

3000~~~
Pretty sure a load of the journalists who cover United (Ogden, Ducker, Taylor, etc.) have said he'll be gone in the summer. I'd be amazed if he's still here at the start of next season.

3001~~~
Nothing would surprise me less than Rafael being sold in the summer. I would have loved to have him as our first choice RB for many years to come, and he have the quality to do it, unfortunately for him a club like Man Utd can't rely on a player with that many injuries - and rightly so.

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3002~~~
But it was the Yoevil game where Rafael started as RB, we actually played 3-5-2 that time, he did his fructure and finished half, it gave McNair a chance to impress, it was never he would start ahead of him as RB, he did well there in his next game and Rafael not fully fit after injury was played in reserves to gain fitness and that's the game you're referring to. That earned him the praise and start I was talking about. The next game against Burnley he was average but deserved to start above anybodydue to the Cambridge game and the next game he played Swansea and subbed of after half time I believe after really poor showing definitely replaced by Valencia who then picked up a good form. The point is Rafael after the injury wasn't fit to start any of the games, he underwent surgery and wasn't rushed back when McNair was on form and deserved to start at least one and a half of the game. It was an experiment for Van Gaal. Valencia since that cemented his position and Van Gaal didn't want to change the back four necessarily.

Let alone that Rafael had a similar season to Shaw who didn't paly due to injury much and spent most of the time playing as LWB which he isn't suited to or just as leftback with no winger ahead of him. Suddenly he plays as LB and and it's completely different story..

3003~~~
Love him, he's brilliant. we will end up shipping him off for peanuts to somewhere like Juve or dortmund where he will look a world beater, then bring in clyne/coleman/etc for like 30m and look like chumps.

3004~~~
I bet the fecker will manage to stay fit for the whole season at his new club. That will be our luck. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3005~~~
You're clutching at straws im afraid. Rafael was fit to play those games (Cambridge, Burnley and Swansea). Matter of fact he even played for the U-21s the night before the Cambridge game and also before Burnley.

3006~~~
Your hate for Rafael is extremely strong.

3007~~~
Please. Hate is a strong word. I was one of his biggest fans when we signed both him and his brother. I was extremely upset  when Moyes let Fabio leave. I thought both of them would go on to be legends at OT. 

Enough is enough though. Its totally clear to me that Rafael is not destined for greatness in football. Its not his fault, i've just moved on completely and im ready for us to march on with a more reliable player

3008~~~
I wonder if LvG blames the Leicester defeat on him.

Though, that game seemed to change LvG's perspective on the whole squad.

3009~~~
RVP seemed ok for LVG after that game?? So did many other players..

3010~~~
I remember reading a lot of people on here saying something similar about Fabio.

3011~~~
Unite we Stand fanzine gossip section this month claims Giggs want him to stay and is trying to convince LVG. They claim his dropping to the bench/reserves is down to his style of play and LVG think he has too many rash moments.

3012~~~
The Cafu of Cardiff.

I think its obvious his style doesn't suit van Gaal. He is like how Ander was at the start, all action, high tempo, just flying around everywhere. Ander said van Gaal told him to stop running around so much and he needs to learn to just stay in place at times. That's where Valencia gets the nod, you know what he is going to do.

3014~~~
He may not be destined for greatness, but if he can clear himself of injuries then he could still be a good player. Even if it's not for us, I think he could make it in a mid-table PL side without too much difficulty.

3015~~~
He has always had his rash moments and goes steaming in to a lot of tackles but apart form that when he is fully fit he is a solid RB and is also pretty good going forward. I think he is vastly underrated by a lot of people. I would like him to stay if he is happy to try and fight for his place in the side.

3016~~~
Off topic. Is Fabio still playing at Cardiff?

3017~~~
I don't think he was ever as good as his brother but his career trajectory has been genuinely disappointing. There was a stretch in the latter parts of the 10/11 where he was our first choice right back and started in the champions league final for us if I recall correctly. Far cry from mediocrity at Cardiff! 

I'd like to think we'd all hope for the best for Rafael if he does leave, as he's such a likeable chap and always worn his passion for our club on his sleeve. Even now he's kept quiet and got on with it despite surely being bitterly disappointed at being frozen out. I personally hope he does go on to become a world beater elsewhere (if not here obviously) just for his sake.

3018~~~
He is. Only 18 appearances for them this season according to Wikipedia. Not sure why he's featured so little.

3019~~~
Because he's a rash defender, who's very injury-prone?

3020~~~
Darmian deal looks on the brink, and LvG appears to be a fan of Valencia, is this the end of Rafael?

His injuries were frustrating, but I loved seeing the little guy play. Total lunatic, tough, big heart, played for the shirt, and displayed great ability. His goals against QPR and Liverpool were awesome. I'll miss him if he goes.

Loco.

3021~~~
I think it is, he is a very good RB with alot of injures unfortunately, i will definitely miss him if he goes. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3022~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3023~~~
Does he count as "home-grown" (I know you bought him when he was pretty young)? I can see other premiership teams being in for him if so.

3024~~~
I am quite sure he does. He would easily worth the risk, I reckon we'll sell him for peanuts.

3025~~~
Pity the way the two da silvas, nani and anderson went.
Ill miss rafael the most.

3026~~~
As frustrating as his injuries are, I wish we would extend his contract for another year or two and loan him out to some Spanish team in need of a right-back. If he continues to be injured, sell him then. There aren't enough good right-backs out there and although we may sign Darmian, I hate to see him do well elsewhere.

3027~~~
I'm convinced he's going to go somewhere else and be an absolute star.

3028~~~
He isn't going to get any better, this would be the best time to get squeeze something out of one of those Brazilian clubs, surely it won't be hard to find a replacement for a 3rd string RB with injury problems who has done feck all in the last 2 seasons.

3029~~~
I hope he goes back to Brazil would hate to see him line up for another Premier League side.

3030~~~
He will be missed, loved his style.
Was the best RB in the league in our last Champions campaign..

3031~~~
Just keep him around, would love him to stay, can't bring myself to see him playing against United.

3032~~~
I think if he goes, he would go out of England. Though I would love him to stay and play.

3033~~~
I always thought we should sign someone to compete with him, whilst he would sort himself out and not get rid entirely.

3034~~~
Would rather have him and Darmian instead of Valencia. Just don't sell him to a PL club.

His goal at Anfield was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3035~~~
One of my favourite players and Im really disappointed he couldnt make it work under LVG.

3036~~~
Always really liked him personality-wise, though sometimes I wondered if that led me to overrating him a bit.

Anyway, it had been clear for a while that he was going to be sold. Says a lot though that even LVG (who clearly didn't rate him) still praised his attitude in a big way earlier in the season.

He could go to a midtable English club and have a big impact, I think.

3037~~~
Think people need to accept that he's off. All the reports seem to suggest that he's been told he's surplus to requirements. It also became abundantly clear last season that LvG was never a fan / didn't rate him. His lack of game time was astonishing.

I'll be sad to see him go, but like Nani, I clearly don't rate him near as highly as some around here seem to. It's strange because the likes of Nani, Ando, Bebe etc should have went a long time ago and we all knew they would. But for Rafael, I always felt there was a chance we might get rid due to his injury problems but on the other hand, I assumed he would stay as second choice if we brought someone in.

3038~~~
Great little player, shame about his injuries

3039~~~
Same.

3040~~~
Im not

3041~~~
It really doesn't matter how terrible a player is for us, when its time for them to leave - fans start to overrate the shit out of them.

3042~~~
When was Rafael ever "terrible" for us? I don't know what some fans see when they watch football.

3043~~~
If he somehow manages to not get injured. Which looks increasingly unlikely.

3044~~~
Rafael lost his job to a winger with no defensive abilities whatsoever and couldn't get it back, he is not suddenly going to turn to a world beater in another team.

3045~~~
It is one thing to be sympathetic, but some of the comments on here will leave you thinking we are about to lose one of the best players in the world (in the last 2 seasons), oh well.

3046~~~
That's true. Although he only actually missed 9 games due to injury up until the end of April last season. Then he fractured a rib which is not exactly a chronic or repeatable injury.

3047~~~
Oh Rafa <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3048~~~
When you look around at the standard of right backs currently, a player with his ability is not a million miles away. I'm not being sympathetic at all, I just genuinely think he's a far better player than many on here give him credit for. Doesn't really matter what I think though because Van Gaal isn't a fan.

Veron didn't make it here and Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder  didn't make it at Real Madrid for whatever reasons. Doesn't mean they aren't great players. Sometimes a coach just doesn't like a player or things don't work out.

3049~~~
No one said anything like that, you are the one who posts this exaggerated nonsense.

3050~~~
Wasnt actually addressing a particular comment, Rafa in the 2012/13 season was a top 10 RB, but he has since regressed due to injuries, he isn't that player anymore, infact i was still optimistic about his abilities till i watched him against Spurs at WHL, at 25 it is definitely probable that he won't surpass his best season with us and with his current injury record he might never get to that level again, which is why i think we should sell him, Tony V is more dangerous going forward and Darmian doesn't seem like an injury prone player.

Veron...yes, Robben and Sneijder however.. where in very different situations from Rafa - which is why they were able to move to other clubs and become World Class players.

3051~~~
This coming from a man who wants to hold on to an injury prone player who seems to have regressed in the last 2 seasons for his sentimental value...Ok.

3052~~~
or a woman*

3053~~~
I've always said we need competition for him, since we can't rely on him, but he's also too good to get rid entirely. Giggs seems to agree with that. There aren't many good right-backs out there and he's turning 25. He still has time on his side and some other manager might use him. Bayern are looking for a right-back as well. He'd probably do well for them. What I've suggested is that we extend his contract one more year and loan him out. Hardly sentimental.

3054~~~
I'll miss him, he's one of my favorite players when he actually plays. His constant injuries have ruined any real chance of him making an impact here again though unfortunately.

3055~~~
If it comes down to keeping either Rafael or Valencia as competition/backup for RB, I know who I'd rather have.  Just several years ago (actually seems more recent than that), everyone here thought he was one of our most consistent performers.

3056~~~
Yes, and i shared the same views..... 2 seasons ago, he has since gone on to make 28 appearances for us, which is really poor, he is a good player on his day, but he cant seem to stay fit, when you combine that with the fact that he is a very reckless player -i think you will agree that having an injury prone right back with a poor disciplinary record might not be the best idea for a team looking to contend, what Darmian needs as a backup is an experienced RB someone in the vein of Coleman,Juanfran, Piszczek etc

3057~~~
Has something happened to make people sure he's off or is it just the Darmian signing? I love Rafael but signing Darmian is great news regardless. Rafael will be a great back up to have if he can get some more luck with injuries. I doubt he's on huge wages so it's surely worth keeping him around in that role if he wants to.

3058~~~
Valencia will be the backup.

Rafael is gone. Don't get why people don't seem to have grasped that. He's not reliable enough. One season out of like 5, where he's managed to stay injury free.

3059~~~
justBoy68 is right though, there's no particular guarantee that he'll actually sell him this summer. Unlike Nani, RVP etc, there've yet to be any serious rumours regarding him actually being put up for sale, or clubs showing interest.

Just because Van Gaal appears to have decided that he can't rely on such an injury-prone player, it doesn't mean he'll insist on immediately selling him. The squad is a very manageable size at the moment, and it's not as if Rafa is on a huge salary. He could easily end up sticking around for another season until LVG is confident that Darmian's settled in.

EDIT: In short, managers don't always get rid of players the instant they decide they don't need them.

3060~~~
He is more than likely going to leave but, worth remembering he was not injured or in poor form when LVG decided to start Valencia ahead of him. People need to stop with the revisionist history when it comes to that.

3061~~~
Based on last season you'd expect so but things can easily change. Who knows what goes on in LvG's crazy mind. He always talks about fitting players into the system and next years system will probably be different to the last, so maybe the personnel he favours will be to. The main point being as Brightonian said above there's no real indicator he is on his way just yet.

3062~~~
Injury prone player LVG doesn't seem to rate or play vs the super fit player all of our last three managers rated and played.

Doesn't take a genius to work out who is gonna get sold.

3063~~~
I'll always remember those two or three glorious times he played the full 90 minutes without leaving on a stretcher or getting substituted.

3064~~~
Yup. Just like the player we sold to Arsenal was never going to become a prolific striker all of a sudden.

3065~~~
Did Valencia really outperform Clyne last season or is that just a rumour?

3066~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3067~~~
Rafael has 1 year left on his contract and didn't renew, Valencia renewed his deal last year. Rafael also played 11 matches last season whilst he was fit to play more, it's looking kinda obvious who is staying as 2nd rightback.

3068~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3069~~~
Nothing too solid on his supposed departure. He probably couldn't get his medical done at this stage so the chances are he may actually stay for now.

3070~~~

3071~~~
Remarkable, i dont think Tony V gets the credit he deserves sometimes.

3072~~~
So you changed your opinion of him as a player based on one game where he came on as a sub at right wing back on his return from injury?! Well done.

I will be really sad to see him leave. LVG clearly wants a different style full back and he has missed a lot of games through injury but when he has played he has been excellent (including the last 2 years). Quality player, great character.

3073~~~
I'm sorry but any sensible person would know (after reading every thing i wrote) that i changed my opinion on him after watching him for 2 seasons, that game was just the last straw, but you just need to pick something to comment on, should have just read the whole thing.

3074~~~
Its slightly odd how Rafael splits opinion here. Obviously its was great to see and him and his brother progress into the first team and at times (in Rafaels case) excel in that position.

The fact remains he never really reached those heights on a consistent basis, over a number of seasons which is what should be the bare minimum at United. His habit of getting yellow cards was also an issue.

I really don't think hes a good as some people here feel he is. Its a pretty obvious departure now and probably has been for 12 months.

3075~~~
This is why I don't want him managing us when LVG retires. Rafael's time at the top is finished, he'll be lucky to play in Italy for a team like Fiorentina or Napoli, but his injury record will follow him wherever he goes. He's going to end up like Fabio, forgotten.

3076~~~
Ditto.

3077~~~
No way am I forgetting Rafael but you are way to harsh saying he couldn't make it for a team like that in Italy. He is a quality player.

3078~~~
For transfer muppets stats isn't important, only important when the player they like have better stats.

3079~~~
Quality player with a fvcked up body for football. Its not his fault

3080~~~
Think Rafa's injuries have skewed some opinions on his ability. At his best he was one of the best RBs in the league. I will miss him if he goes. I haven't seen any reports linking him with anyone though?

3081~~~
Valencia gets lots of yellow cards, this rash nonsense needs to stop. It's quite funny how people don't want to talk about a player who had a tremendous season in our last title winning season because it's ages ago now, and seem to forget how good he was for us that year until shit hit the fan with Moyes, yet they believe other players can rediscover form from 2009/10 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I miss rafa bombing down the right. So much energy and passion. Valencia pales in comparison but he's a safe player who takes no risks at all.

3082~~~
Even under Moyes, look at our more positive footballing performances, he was pivotal to it.

3083~~~
This is true.

3084~~~
Galatasaray are closing in apparently,Turkey....not bad.

3085~~~
So he's going to end up going to Turkey for like 3m. What a waste !

3086~~~
He could do so much better. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3087~~~
Sevilla could use him, since Vidal is going to Barcelona.

3088~~~
Oh Rafael if only you weren't so injury prone. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3089~~~
You just know wherever he goes he will stay fit forever and become the best RB in the world, and end up at Madrid or Barca <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3090~~~
Gala is more than he could have hoped for

3091~~~
Gala is definitely better than West Brom

3092~~~
Such a shame. He's a terrific player when he's fit. Has everything you'd want from a fullback and his natural potential if he could have kept fit should have been super high.

3093~~~
Is Sneijder still at Gala? And is he still denying that he's interested in United...even when nobody's asked him if he's interested in United?

3094~~~
Some journo saw him on the street yesterday and said hello, and he immidiately said:

"No, I will not swap clubs with Rafael."

3095~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3096~~~
Lmao ^

3097~~~
I think he will be poor for Galatasaray and will probably end up at some obscure Spanish mid-table side like Cordoba/Levante in 2 years.

3098~~~
Some here wanted to buy Clyne over Tony V.... Baffling!

3099~~~
Well that makes three on their way to Turkey. RVP, Nani and Rafael can still get together and reminisce on the good ol days

3100~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3101~~~
This sucks. We are going to have to wait for one of the players to write a book until we find out what happened between Rafael and Van Gaal. Hopefully Darmian will be a great signing. I will miss Rafael though he was a fighter.

3102~~~
I just think van gaal wants our fullbacks to be more influential in our build up play and not just crazily run with the ball before they cross or shoot. Someone dribbling like that disrupts the whole teams movement and passing ranges as a relatively compact team geta spread out.

3103~~~
if not for those injuries he would have been our RB for this decade.

sad to see him leaving but at least it is abroad. always prefer to see our ex players leave for another club outside england.

3104~~~
What makes you say something happened? 

The guy couldn't stay fit for 2 minutes. That's what happened. LVG has to get rid of the sicknotes in the back line. And he's most likely getting rid of Rafael and Evans, which make the most sense.

3105~~~
shudup

3106~~~
he will stay and prove himself. Where's that italian back btw?

3107~~~
They are both shite.

3108~~~
He was fit when he lost his place to Valencia. And was fit for months playing in u-21 matches when he was ribs were broken from a kick.

3109~~~
Are you serious arguing that Rafael is injury free? The guy is not reliable. He's had one season in like five for us, where he has managed to be injury free. How are we supposed to build a defence on that? Vidic, Rio and Evra at their peak were constants in the team. We need to get back to that rather than our defenders playing musical chairs.

When he came back from his broken cheekbone, he got injured again after that. I can't believe people are suggesting something happened. Van Gaal is being ruthless, which is what Fergie should have done in his last few years with the sicknotes.

Jones and Smalling will stay as they signed new contracts. There is just no place for Rafael or Evans. We need to sign players who don't get injured every two weeks.

3110~~~
I predict he'll be back in Brazil within 2 seasons

3111~~~
From his facebook

'A new season start. Let's keeping fighting.'

That's the spirit, would love him to stay even though it looks as though he could be off.

3112~~~
I thought his English should be much much better after 7 years?

3113~~~
Well, this is equivalent to Memphis liking "Welcome to Liverpool" comment on his page, but Rafael has liked the "Please don't go" comment. There you go.

3114~~~
Good bye Rafael and let the door don't hit you, where the god lord split you.

3115~~~
Since were signing Darmian I am happy for Rafa to stay and fight for his place. If he leaves however its no biggie.

3116~~~
I really do hope he stays and fights for his place. Still embodies our utd spirit more than any other player.

3117~~~
But I love him so much <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3118~~~
Stay Rafa!

3119~~~
Such a likeable player but if injuries are going to keep him in and out of the side long-term, it wouldn't be the worst idea for him to go into an environment with less pressure.

I think Nani is an example. He played with freedom last season and benefitted from it, and should carry on in the same vein in Turkey. 

Would prefer him to stay and fight for the spot as he is clearly extremely talented, but wouldn't be averse to him making the move for the sake of his career.

3120~~~
Ahh he doesn't have problems with pressure. It was all about injuries in the last two seasons. I still hope he can have a good tour and do a Young. It would be such a shame if we would sell him because i think he can be still a very good player for us.

Just two years ago he played 40 games in one season so it is clear he can stay injury free. Even in Moyes season he collected 28 apperances in one season. Last season he was really unlucky with his injuries early on and when he came back the team were working reasonable well and i think the only reason he didn't get back in the first team is because LVG didn't want to risk things. Similar reason why Di Maria didn't get a lot of opportunities either.
But he had unlucky impact injuries (like broken cheekbone itd).

I hope and believe LVG will give him opportunity to prove himself before deciding to sell him.

And to everyone who want Rafael to be sold a little reminder:
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://img.skysports.com/10/11/496x259/Rafael-Carlos-Tevez-head-to-head_2525543.jpg" src="http://img.skysports.com/10/11/496x259/Rafael-Carlos-Tevez-head-to-head_2525543.jpg"/>

3121~~~
freshly 25 years old , younger than Darmian, a couple of seasons ago best right back in the premier league, proven player but injury prone, he was quite unlucky last term, broken cheek and ribs is something which doesn't happen to you often. Never has a problem to play straight away, without need to get into form which is valuable asset and for that reason I feel it would be unwise selling him now..  He should stay and fight for his place.

3122~~~
I have a feeling he'll stay, RBs will be Darmian/Rafael, LBs Shaw/Blind/Darmian with Valencia playing on the wings again.

3123~~~
How much are they offering for him?

3124~~~
He is more attacking while Darmian is more defensive. Two different type of players with different statistics in terms of physical. Could be utilised for different tactics and games. Hope he won't be sold. Perhaps there is a capable 'backup' waiting in the youth team, but 'til then hope he stays.

3125~~~
Tony V?

3126~~~
I guess Tony could be like Blind who a third choice LB behind Shaw and Rojo. He could go back to be the winger he is or maybe LvG has some other plans for him too.

3127~~~
Admire the faith some have in him. Mine has gone. I'm as relieved as pleased that Darmian has arrived.

3128~~~
Glad to hear that he wants to stay and fight.But I'm not sure LVG will give him that chance.

3129~~~
I have no issues with him staying as a backup RB.

3130~~~
would love him to stay. A favourite.

3131~~~
He's been one of my favourite players since he joined us but I'd be amazed if he was here next season.

3132~~~
He's gone as soon as we can find a buyer. Lvg doesn't rate / trust him

3133~~~
Really don't want him to leave, he deserves more of a chance than lvg has given him so far. We should be keeping him and darmian as our next 2 rb for years.

3134~~~
why? He's been failing to deliver for the past few years

3135~~~
That's just not true. His performances have been fine, he's just had a few untimely injuries. He definitely has a higher level than Valencia showed all last year.

3136~~~
Yes, but he hasn't been shown us that "higher level" in 2 seasons

3137~~~
He hasnt produced the goods on a regular rate for years. We are a football club and not a clinic

3138~~~
If you had been in charge of Barca, Xavi and Iniesta would have been gone long before 2008, while Pique would never have been brought back.

3139~~~
He was our 2nd best player in fergies last year, and arguably our best performing player under Moyes. Yes this year he's struggled but he's  hardly been given a chance so far.

3140~~~
This. Van Gaal's ruthlessness so far has been needed and most welcome.

3141~~~
Hes rarely available. Im glad we are showing him the door. Hes as overrated as the new cafu at cardiff

3142~~~
He's far too good to be letting go at his age. At some point we will need to get rid of him if he doesn't ever show an inability to stay for but that time isn't now.  

You'd think his drop in form was monumental going by some here. He still was one of our better players ever time he played.

3143~~~
I like Rafael but if he was genuinely as good as we say on here he wouldn't be linked with these sorts of clubs, given that he has a year left on his deal. I think he'll be one that floats around Europe for another few years and then heads off home.

3144~~~
This.

3145~~~
He will become the new Cafu of fenerbache just as his brother became the new roberto carlos of cardiff. We just love hyping our crocked homegrown talent

3146~~~
i think hes being sold for his lack of fitness not lack of ability. he'll end up in serie A in a season or two and do well there i imagine/hope. too mentally strong to run back to brazil with his tail between his legs.

3147~~~
Ship him out and lets see how good a career he can manage elsewhere.

3148~~~
It’s really hard to believe some people think he will stay. There is no need for 3 right backs, especially as our number two is never injured and physical beast, and our number one is still young.
At this moment he is so low in pecking order that he just needs to leave for his own sake. I am extremely happy with the thought of actual right back who can play consistently week in week out, even if he isn’t as good offensively as Rafael.

3149~~~
Surprised at how many want him to stay. Why should we keep giving chances to players we can't rely on? LvG isn't messing about with players he doesn't see a future for at the club and I like that about him. A trait Fergie definitely had lost in his latter years.

I'm not that surprised in all honesty, he seems to be one of the more popular players on here with quite a few willing to defend him whereas Valencia gets given a ton of shit for any mistakes he makes and not much praise even if he plays well. Look at his thread after the Arsenal FA Cup game, people saying he should never play again due to that miss hit back pass. Rafael has been our best right back for a while now but the gap between him and Tony is overstated in my opinion and it sounds pretty harsh because he's been a decent player for us but once Darmian gets going next season I don't think he'll be that badly missed.

3151~~~
It really is amazing how when something is repeated often enough it is deemed fact. Opinions are subjective but "Rafael has been crap for 2 years" is just wrong. He was actually one of United's most creative players under Moyes and look at the average rating he had last season - far higher than Valencia (one that is lower than it should be after the Leicester knee jerk). After ending the season on a low ebb the "he had a crap season" comments are just lazy.

When on the pitch he has been excellent. He will leave United because he plays instinctively and doesn't suit a possession game that LVG favours. He will find a club that suits him better and will do well. It is a shame because he was tailor made for United under the old regime.

3152~~~
He's shown a higher top level at RB than any of our other options, and I would say, anyone in the PL outside Ivanovic. He was progressing steadily and had a great 2012/13 season, his injuries came back next year and became worse this year, and it didn't help that his coaches didn't trust him.

Darmian is untested and I would trust Rafael to be a better backup and better competition than Valencia (we can always play Young there if they do actually get injured together)

Again, as a Barca executive, would you have kicked out the 19 year old Messi simply for being injury-prone? A young Iniesta for not delivering on his potential? Xavi for stagnating and playing second fiddle to Deco? Pique for not making the United team?

I'm not saying Rafael is comparable to any of these players; I'm saying he has shown enough to be kept ahead of Valencia. Unfortunately, I know it is not going to happen.

3153~~~
With Darmian joining he will definitely get the starting RB spot with his level of ability. One backup is enough and I think Valencia will fulfill that role. Sadly Rafael like many Brazilians before him has so far been riddled with injuries which has meant that he only had 1 full consistent season with our club in which he showed ability to be one of the best right backs anywhere. It's a shame but football is ruthless and like van Persie, we can't keep players that are only fit for half a season.

3154~~~
Darmian is a regular italian international who kept both baines and clyne in his pockets. Just because he didnt spent most of his career at uniteds clinic that doesnt mean that hes untested.

If hes so good then he will end up at a great side as quality rightbacks are in demand. Lets see if other managers share your opinion about him. The other coming of the christ ended up erm at cardiff

3155~~~
I've seen a bit of Darmian for Italy and I like him.
I also liked what I saw of di Maria at Madrid and Falcao at Atletico...

3156~~~
Very very very different scenarios, besides Di Maria is still a top player.

3157~~~
Yes, but it suggests that adapting to a new league may take time for any player no matter how good.

3158~~~
I can't believe people still think he's staying. Did last season not happen or something? What am I missing? Some of you lot obviously rate him but LvG clearly doesn't.

3159~~~
Which is why we have our first choice RB from last season as a back up.

3160~~~
I liked di maria even at United altough theres room for improvement. Falcaos injuries ruined him.

3161~~~
Then why not compare him to players he is comparable to?

3162~~~
Because the criticism of him (that I was responding to) was not about his performance but about his injuries and his stagnation.

3163~~~
I believe he is much better than out 1st choice RB last season.

3164~~~
Hence why we are keeping valencia. If we wanted darmian to understand more how the clinic work we could have kept rafael instead

3165~~~
Yeah but obviously a more gifted player will be cut more slack. Who would you give more chances to Paulo Maldini or Paul Koncheskey? There comes a point when you have to decide if a player is worth it.

3166~~~
Ok, and you have every right to believe whatever you want, fortunately, the manager doesn't share the same view and dont blame him.

3167~~~
Ah. So we want Darmian to understand how to fire in a cross at the 1st defender and how to be out of position all the time.

3168~~~
I don't think he is a major wage liability, I think he has shown a high ceiling, and I think our other choice in that position is, well, literally all over the place. So (IMO) he is worth it.

Anyway, as I said, he's going, like with Nani and RvP, I'm resigned.

3169~~~
Apparently he is part of a deal for Gaitan - which basically makes it a nothing story (as is any story with Gaitan).

3170~~~
How about a loan move to determine his future?

3171~~~
To play for LvG you need to tick few/some boxes,how it looks only boxes he ticks are those liked by the fans,maybe he cant control his inner fire i dont know.

3172~~~
He kept the crock on the bench this season

3173~~~
feck this shit. Not going on tour, way to kill my muppet hour <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

Oh well, it was coming and as much as I want him to stay, it's understandable. Will miss this guy like crazy.

3174~~~
Na Rafael at the traveling squad apparently? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3175~~~
Rafa <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3176~~~
I'd like to say I'd miss him but while he's been a great servant for the club, he's only given us one full season. His constant injuries have been a bit annoying and it's probably the right decision as we won't ever be able to rely on him. I'm more than happy to see Darmian take his place and wouldn't mind seeing Rafael move on.

3177~~~
Personally don't want him to leave! One of my favorite United players, injuries have been very unkind to him.

3178~~~
Quite sad that it's now the end of the road here for him. I think him and Valdes staying behind means they must be pretty close to going and possibly even have moves agreed.

Hope it works out for him.

3179~~~
Not really that bothered. Quality in the 2012/13 season mind, but persistent injuries will derail what could have been a very good defender.

3180~~~
I still think it would be a mistake to let him go. He's a much better fullback than Valencia.

3181~~~
Well this surely puts it to bed that he's 100% definitely off.

3182~~~
its not his injuries but poor man-management that he suffered from the last two seasons here, but most here don't want to hear anything negative about Van Gaal which doesn't fit their narrative.

And Rafael is in good company like Rivaldo, Riquelme, to whom Van Gaal took an irrational dislike (of course it will be justified by the like of the propaganda puppies like NL Max)

Anyways, I am glad we have gone for someone comparable like Darmian instead of inferior replacements like Clyne

3183~~~
Yep. It's the right time and for the best in my opinion though a bit of a shame as I think he loved playing for the club.

3184~~~
Talk of a move to Rome. I'd like to see him get a proper move to a competitive club and show everybody just how good a player he can be. His fitness issues have blighted his career, and we just can't carry players like that anymore. 

All the best to him going forward.

3185~~~
Van Gaal's only been here one season.

3186~~~
Pretty gutted really, especially as he clearly doesn't want to leave. I just hope he moves too a good club like Roma or Milan Etc.

3187~~~
I'll be sad. Love the little guy.

3188~~~
Don't leave Rafa!
