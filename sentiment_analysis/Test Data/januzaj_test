tis the season.

whether he gets deployed as a striker or any of the positions behind it, here's to hoping adnan forgets what happened last year and goes back to the promise he displayed in his first season. 

having a good preseason will be absolutely key for him.

2~~~
He still looks the same physically as he did when he broke through, I'm hoping for him to take a step forward and if di Maria leaves, hopefully he gets proper playing time.

3~~~
May just be me, but I'm after watching footage of the latest training footage and it looks to me that he's bulked up.

4~~~
Looking forward to him this season, massive potential.

5~~~
He'll be 21 next Feb so perhaps it's time!

6~~~
Much needed... Especially if he gets games up front. Hopefully he kicks on this season, he'll get a lot more chances then last season I think.

7~~~
Reminded me strangely of a young Ronaldo today

8~~~
Not a great game for either him or Wilson.

9~~~
Thought he was decent today. Glimpses of his talent.

10~~~
Definitely bulked up, also starting to stay on his feet more.

11~~~
He was far better than Wilson who was pretty poor.

Still think he's playing too much as an attacker. Almost a second striker today.

12~~~
Januzaj can be young Ronaldo, Depay can be prolific Ronaldo. Both at the same time... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

13~~~
Not sure why some people are slagging of Januzaj's performance when his hold up play was the best of any of the front men today. Also showed willingness to make runs behind the defence and moved the ball quickly when he needed to. Created a chance out of nothing also, using his new-found bulk.

14~~~
Before this game I thought Januzaj might not feature as much this season and push for a move due a lack of game time but I think he's going to make a strong case for himself. Boy's growing up.

15~~~
I like Januzaj's versatility - I can see him being useful out wide, at #10 or as a false 9.

Really hope he has a massive season this year and is given the chance to do so.

16~~~
I've completely forgot about Januzaj. I still feel he's one of the best youngsters in the world, he didn't get a proper chance last season most likely due to the balance of the squad and lack of games. 

I wouldn't mind to see him as a number 9 with the lack of striker options we have. He's played there for the reserves and looked quite sharp, he's not going to bully any CB's but he can go in behind or drop deep and run from there. He's got everything in his locker to be one of the best in his position, he can beat defenders from a starting position and has plenty of tricks to leave them standing. In addition, his vision is top class, he just needs to add consistency to that and choose the right moments to play the killer ball. His shooting is akin to Nani's, sometimes wild but naturally a good finisher. 

It seemed last season that he was trying to hard to impress which led to him shooting from impossible angles or being selfish but I'm sure with more game time he will develop into a top player. If not, we need to loan him out so he doesn't stagnate. He's already had a taste of first team football now, he can't go back to the reserves.

17~~~
I think Adnan may go on loan and we keep Di Maria. He looked good when he came on, he just needs to get game time and keep working on getting stronger. I liked his performance though. He was unlucky not to score - eventually those chances will go in hopefully.

18~~~
Why ? He's certainly talented, but excepting a handful of games under Moyes, he has not shown any indication that he is improving over the past 20 months or so.

19~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2WF4m7fAp_s?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Januzaj needs to be on the ball more and have some sort of freedom to pull the strings. Out of the youth players we have he's the best at it. It's a shame that he keeps getting played in positions where he sees so little of the ball. Sometimes I feel his all around ability could be a detriment to his progress. Gribbin is a similar player.

20~~~
Thought he looked good, and improved physically it seemed. Think he will have a much better season, hope his confidence grows because it seemed it was back

21~~~
If we isn't used much this year I think he should go on a loan, he's grown quite a bit recently and looks pretty tall now, certainly has got Stronger too. I think he could grow to be a pastore/kaka type CAM, but he really does need games now. Looked sharp with Wilson and Pereira anyway.

22~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBq9PHIwq3I?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe> So easily forgotten what this young lad is capable of.

23~~~
I agree with that, I think his upper body looks thicker than before.

24~~~
Really is a super talent. Hopefully it's a clean slate for him this year and gets games and kicks on.

25~~~
Thought he looked good the other day.. Surprised some were criticizing him. He looked a lot more confident then last season, and bulkier, and that was the main problem from last year IMO. He just had no confidence so his performances suffered. Clearly has loads of talent, just needs to have the confidence to try things and not run down blind alleys all the time.

26~~~
I hope he gets a loan to somewhere like Watford. They're building a good team and he's at a level he would be able to play every week and be one of the focuses of the team.

Him behind Deeney or Vydra would be great.

27~~~
Agree with this. He looks significantly stronger to me. Read an interview Luke Shaw did with mutv about both of them bringing one of the trainers with them on vacation to Dubai.

28~~~
He's the player we should build our team around. He needs to be played like how Zidane was used during his career. Can we stop using him as some runner and let him run the show. If we don't do that, he won't fulfil his potential here and we've seen the consequences of letting extremely talented youngsters go. He's imo the player with the biggest upside in the whole squad, let's treat him like he is.

29~~~
Building your team around a teenager who hasn't proven anything yet? 

Seems legit.

30~~~
i think he proved a few things in his first year, don't you?

but suffice to say last year wasn't good by pretty much anybody's standards, so he'd best be getting on with things this year if he wants to have a chance here. just not sure how guys like him and periera will get a chance to show their worth if we're constantly buying players in their positions. i know we're united and we need to be the best, and that requires buying top talent pretty much every window, but i hope our own guys not only get a chance to show their worth but take that chance too.

31~~~
Prefer him on the wings taking on people. Much more entertaining than playing #10

32~~~
he proved he's a talented young chap, definitely, but certainly not worthy of building our entire fecking team around. That's just ludicrous. Very few players should be afforded that privilege, and certainly not when they're teenagers. Ronaldo is the last player Fergie truly built a team around (although Rooney was the focal point for some spells too) and that wasn't until after his fourth season where he won POTY.

33~~~
all fair enough, and to be clear i don't think we should be building our team around januzaj either. i'd hope that most would agree that unless you have messi or ronaldo, it's daft to build a team around a single player for a whole set of reasons.

34~~~
When the teenager is as talented as he is, its worth it.

35~~~
God.

He is so far from the level you seem to think he is it's unimaginable.

36~~~
RooneyLegend is prone to the odd wacky player observation but he isn't too far wrong here.

We're in no position to build around Januzaj as of now, that's an exaggeration. Personally, I think he desperately needs a loan at a club that will offer him game time centrally. When given that freedom I think he'll turn out into something really quite brilliant. The raw talent and intuition is overwhelmingly evident, and I hope it's here at United he progresses. If it's not us, it will be some other club that takes the initiative and plays him through the centre.

End product would have to improve a lot, however. His finishing isn't up to par.

37~~~
You'd think that because of how he's been used in this team. Player usage is very very important to said players ability to reach their full potential. Since he's started player he's literally only played one match the way I mention, and that causes him to try things that don't come natural to him. This then causes him to make mistakes and have people on this forum calling him over hyped and all sorts of other nonsense. 

When Zidane moved to Juventus, they didn't know what to do with him. For the first few months no one was impressed as Lippi for reasons unknown to mankind was trying to turn him into a Redondo like player. He then started using him correctly and the rest as they say is history. 

It makes a big difference and its the reason why some on here fail to recognise just how much potential this kid has. Thinking he's ryan giggs in the making is absurd. We should be thinking Riquelme, Zidane, Iniesta, Valderama, Valeron, Valdivia with him, instead we have a inconsistent winger who can't even decide when to cross the ball or pass. 

We've developed 3 of these types of players in recent years(Morrison, Daehli, and Januzaj), signed 2 other one's(Kagawa and Anderson) before them but unfortunately none has been used that way they've all predictably failed and our midfield as a unit has suffered.

38~~~
He had a decent debut season in which I think he was not as good as people seem to believe (some seemed to have had him on the talent level of Ronaldo, Messi, even Robben when he didn't really show that sort of potential). Very good and definitely showed great signs of promise but it wasn't completely flawless and it's not like his last season popped out of nowhere - there were also times when he struggled in his first season and it was evident last season that he's still some distance behind the level a first team regular winger of Man Utd should be at. First season put some unnecessary pressure on the kid too.

I find comparisons with Zidane or Ronaldo a bit silly because they all seem to stem from the fact that he has struggled a bit in his early career. Not every player that struggles in his early career ends up being the best player in the world, actually nothing in the fact of struggling in the early stage points to the fact that they're going to be world class, quite the contrary and majority of struggling teenagers don't really end up at world class level.

He has some potential clearly and I believe he could easily reach a level where he would be a regular at United because there's a very good player there. He has plenty of distance to go before he reaches that level though and we should definitely not build a team around him at the moment.

39~~~
Adnan and Shaw had a club trainer in Dubai during their vacations to help them train and come back fitter for the pre season... 
He is trying... hope he gets his chance..

40~~~
Cannot agree with all of that. His first season considering he was still 18 (?) and was playing in a shambles of a team formations where he was constantly isolated on the wings was all in all v.good, not decent. His footballing brain seemed more developed than Ronaldo's at 18. He was dribbling, crossing, playing through balls and chipped in with some good and important goals. There was every reason to suggest he's an exceptional talent. Easy to rubbish Ronaldo comparisons having the benefit of knowledge what has he become but for every Ronaldo who made it you've got Quaresma who didn't and he was just as highly rated in the youth Portugal NT sides. I think it's fair to say Januzaj's influence at 18 was as meaningful as Ronaldo's first season when he came here. Doesn't mean he's as talented, though.

I think that season drained him and this is the point where I agree with you. He was carrying us on his shoulders in some games and everyone was like 'imagine next season'. It went downhill from there unfortunately but he's still extremely young for a squad player at Manchester United and he will improve. Van Gaal will find a position for him, he's got a good track at that. Aforementioned Robben didn't know his position when he was 18 and it was Van Gaal who suggested he moved from striker to wing position.

41~~~
The talent is there, but he need to improve his decision-making and end-products before playing a main role in this team.
Either a loan or as an impact sub would be his role for next season.

42~~~
LVG needs to play a fecking 4-2-3-1 already and give the front 4 chance to roam around.

That would suit Januzaj best right now and is also most suited to rest of our squad like Di Maria, Rooney, Mata and even Depay.

But he seems to prefer playing 4-4-2 or a very rigid 4-3-3.



I think Januzaj is best on the right, with a license to roam in. Though the 2 shots he took in the last game was interesting and pretty good. That's a aspect of his game that is improving.

43~~~
Struggled to get into the game, I don't think the left wing is his most comfortable position.

44~~~
Not his best performance. Needs a loan where he can play consistently to rebuild his confidence.

45~~~
Yeah his confidence looks shot. Nothing happens instinctively, he overthinks everything and that really neutralizes his biggest strengths as a player.

46~~~
Seems LVG has instructed him to cut down on risks he takes plus he ended up being doubled team almost all the game because Blackett wasn't much of a outlet say compared to a Shaw.

Didn't do anything special but didn't do anything bad either. LVG might be pleased.

47~~~
I wouldn't read too much into 45 mins in which he rarely got the ball in a good position to make anything happen. I noticed one through-ball to Wilson that was over-hit but otherwise the opportunities weren't there. It's not like he wasted several good openings. On one occasion he did a nice flick inside to Wilson who didn't see it coming at all.

48~~~
He needs a loan.

Last season he was trying to dribble like an out and out winger. Now he's just happy to play a full 45 minutes of passing sideways. 

He needs a reboot, and regular game time.

49~~~
So weird that a talent is really far off from his debut level.

50~~~
I wouldn't read too much onto a pre-season game.Loads of other senior players (and new signings) look average.

51~~~
Agreed. The only thing I'm interested in really is how the players are communicating with one another.

52~~~
I love LvG but it's fairly clear Adnan's natural instincts have been coached out of him to a certain degree. He used to try to take players on all of the time - sometimes it came off sometimes it didn't. I get the impression LvG didn't like the element of risk because it's clear Adnan is reluctant to try at times now, so he ends up playing it safe a lot which is the opposite of what made him so exciting in his breakthrough season.

An Everton loan wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. He's still an exciting talent.

53~~~
If we keep playing him on the wing, we'll see no improvement. That's just not his position. Behind the striker or as the second striker is where he belongs.

54~~~
Senior players can afford to slack off a little (although I usually hate slacking in any discipline), but a youngster like Januzaj cannot afford that because he is supposed to fight for a spot with the main squad. That's how it's supposed to be in training camp: youngsters playing all out to steal a spot.

55~~~
They didn't slack off, they played shit because their fitness level and mutual understanding aren't there yet.

56~~~
I've said from the start he's massively overrated on here. 

Him and sterling broke through at roughly the same time and look how for sterling has gone whereas Januzaj has gone nowhere in his development. He really needs a loan for regular games.

57~~~
He is not overrated at all. What he did in his first season at his age was pure quality; it was world class potential. 

It's clear to see something is wrong in the position he's playing in or maybe following Van Gaals philosophy. I believe he'll be bigger than sterling eventually. Seems like a player that thrives on confidence.

58~~~
He's not overrated he was one of the few good players under Moyes. Full of confidence, great football brain and made things happen. Without getting into a Sterling vs Adnan debate I think if Adnan was given the opportunities that Sterling has had we would see a much more complete player. Sterling has had some pretty poor patches (which is to be expected for young players) but Liverpool have trusted and to a certain extent relied on him so he's been able to keep his development going. If Adnan doesn't play well we don't see him again for a month or two.

One thing I think he really has to do is tie down a position. I thought he was going to become a winger when he broke into the team but he still wants this role behind the striker. The problem is everyone wants to play there these days.

A loan could do him good but I always worry with youngsters we send out because unless they are undroppable managers will always prefer an experienced player who is tied to the club. Basically we need a B team it's mental we haven't got them in this country.

59~~~
Is this opportunities nonsense really true?

He's made 56 appearances in all competitions in two seasons. I think that's a lot of time to improve your overall level of play. He hasn't had to deal with a serious injury either. Van Gaal does have a certain philosophy which can be restrictive but all this he could be at sterling levels talk seems like delusion.

60~~~
Janusaj trying g effortlessly to get into the ball. Blackett missed almost every single one of his runs.

61~~~
Janusaj looks more deadly when he is on the right or playing through the middle.

62~~~
It's pre-season so even I'll cut Adnan slack here. It's meaningless. We won everything last year then lost to Swansea. 

Finding it highly amusing that people want LVG to adapt the team setup to suit Januzaj already though. Until he proves himself, that's never happening and should never happen. 

I get LVG's style may not suit but it's also offering enough for Januzaj to fit into too. Safe ball playing and positional movement. It's basic fundamental stuff and last season his decision making was shown to be very poor because he couldn't cope with that at the level. 

He has it in him to do very well if his application improves. Big year ahead. I'd back a loan in Jan if he gets nowhere before then. 18 months under Louis' training is enough of a chance and enough of a window to judge him by for van Gaal.

63~~~
He probably needs SAF type of manager who as RVP said goes to him and tells him to excite him in tight matches and not bother about failing few times.

64~~~
Very sensible post.

65~~~
Had a poor game. Seems reluctant to take players on and misplaced a few passes.

66~~~
His natural instinct isn't to dribble. I believe what he did at youth level is what tips you off on his natural instincts. He only dribbled on occasion and it was never his focus. What was his natural instinct was to come to the ball with the freedom to go wherever he pleased and build the attacks. You can see that in his first preseason with United and a lot of his matches in his first season. Although under Moyes he did start to dribble a lot more and it did become his natural instinct under Moyes. I believe he was coached to make things happen and because his dribbling had a lot of success he started to rely on it.

Towards the 2nd half of Moyes' season he started to just stay on the wing and dribble. So he had a lot of quiet games, very lively games, and frustrating games. With LVG he does the same thing, but after his dribbling wasn't as successful as under Moyes, he started to be more conservative.

He needs to be allowed to come to the ball and get in the game is what I think. Now that I think about it, I don't think he needs to come to the ball, but he certainly needs freedom to dribble/pass his way to central areas allowing him to act more like a midfielder/10 than a winger.

67~~~
Agree with this, he needs to play in behind the striker with the freedom to move laterally and find space. I don't think Van Gaal rates him highly enough to give him games there though, and his lack of energy and work rate won't help. I sometimes feel he needs a kick up the arse to get himself into games and try harder, but maybe that's not what Van Gaal wants him to do.

68~~~
What exactly has he done though to show you he can be world class, after a break through start he's done absolutely nothing since and I mean zilch. I'm fairly confident in saying He will never reach sterlings level. As I said he needs a loan to get regular minutes, We will see how good he is then. For me though the jury is still out on him.

69~~~
Absolutely zilch? He's had two seasons here. In one, he has basically carrying the whole Man United team at times looking like our only threat. In the second season, he was struggling because of his position.

"absolutely nothing and I mean zilch". Give me a break.. you clearly haven't seen the boy enough.

70~~~
He's scored 4 goals in 2 seasons and 2 of those came in one game. It's Not the quality of a potential world class player. He's no different now to the player he was when he made his debut and If anything he's worse.theres always people coming up with excuses but he's had plenty of matches to,improve and the simple fact is he hasn't.

71~~~
Regardless of your opinion on him its silly to use his goal tally as any sort of barometer of his potential.

72~~~
I'm one of Januzaj's biggest fanboi's on here but I've been underwhelmed by his performances so far this preseason to put it mildly, it's a big year for him and he really needs to show his talent, I'm starting to get slightly concerned.

I think he's struggling with LvG's -less-risks taken- system, also I don't know what the hell has happened to Wilson lately either.

73~~~
Yes because you need goals to judge a players potential. To suggest Januzaj has done "zilch" is ridiculous no matter how much you rate him or not.

74~~~
As an attacking player then yes goals are a good judge of a player. 4 goals in 50 odd appearances  isn't good enough at all, Regardless of age. 

Anyway we will see how he goes next season

75~~~
Januzaj played a little over 1000 minutes last season which is the equivalent of about ten and a half full games, and those minutes were spread across an entire season. There is no way a player can find any sort of form when he's playing so infrequently, especially when he found himself playing in a different position in a different formation almost every time he got into the team.

76~~~
Misused again, another underwhelming performance. If this goes on we're gonna lose a sparkling talent.

77~~~
Fantastic finish. He seems to have a future up there.

78~~~
Thought he was very good today. Obviously should have scored early on but since then I thought his performance was encouraging. Made a lot of good runs behind and looked quick, held it up well and looked a hell of a lot more enthusiastic compared to the other previous games. Maybe as a striker is where his future belongs.

79~~~
Best 30 mins from Adnan for a long time. Looked a real threat.

80~~~
Too talented to not make it here.

81~~~
Looked very threatening and comfortable upfront - delighted he scored after missing his first chance.

Looks stronger and quicker too. Could be a brilliant forward and could get plenty of opportunities in the 4411 as either the 9 or 10

82~~~

83~~~
He's a really talented player, he didn't have the best season last year but I've no doubt he's going to make it. He needs to keep getting minutes, he already offers a lot.

84~~~
He has totally bulked up. It has added a lot his arsenal.

85~~~
He's bulked up hasn't he.

86~~~
Hopefully get's some game time upfront or as a 10 this season

87~~~
Definitely. I don't want to get over excited from a preseason friendly, but friendly aside, we shouldn't sign any more attacking players and keep him in the team. He can play as a striker or behind the striker. Anything central because that is where he belongs.

None of the winger BS.

88~~~
Looks good playing up top. Who would have thought? Hopefully this will bring his confidence back. Januzaj the surprise striker?

89~~~
Best game of the preseason so far. Very involved and excellent movement upfront.

90~~~
There has something dramatic happened with Adnans physique. Strong and lightning fast. 
We should stick with him this season. I have a feeling.

91~~~

92~~~
It looks like LVG was looking for the right position for Januzaj in this tour and i think he found it. Goal, nice attempt which was not as easy as it looked and some good runs. Only mistake he made was a pass to Perreira which was just a bit to far for Perreira.

93~~~
Was very good. Him,  Andrea and Jesse take our attack to the sort of technical level it should be at. Hope he has a great season.

94~~~
He and Shaw took a club trainer on holiday. Both determined to make a success of this season

95~~~
Great by him and he looked very good up front.

96~~~
Suggestion? I am almost certain LVG said it himself last season

97~~~
I like that attitude! <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

98~~~
He mentioned taking a personal trainer on holiday to get himself in shape. Great attitude to have to be honest.

99~~~
Me too. You'd imagine van Gaal would be impressed by that.

100~~~
Was great today, should definitely be an option up front. Looks so much better as a striker or #10 then as a winger, he's too indecisive out there. That goal will do wonders for his confidence as well, delighted for him

101~~~
Great to see him score, pretty good cameo, coulda easily had two, but settled down after early miss.

102~~~
Really pleased for him, hopefully he can get some confidence from this goal! Looks strong as feck, that summer training really worked for him.

103~~~
He did? In any case signs are very good.

104~~~
Actually loooked like a striker, good movement and hold up play. Only looked poor when boxed in wide.

105~~~
Yeah he did, I'm sure of it.

Also played up front too, not sure why people are acting like its a surprise.

106~~~
Yep. I'd be delighted to see van Gaal ignore Cavani and co. and give Januzaj a real chance. He played far too little last year.

107~~~
Great 30 mins, will really help his confidence. 

Also way more energetic than usual, as it should be!

108~~~
Glad he scored and it will do wonders for his confidence. Think he'll have a good season and can definitely see him have a future as a striker and would love for him to succeed in that position (or any other). He's got all the right qualities.

109~~~
A journalist asking an obvious question?

Surely not?

110~~~
<a class="username" data-user="96090, @Santiago_KinderBueno" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/96090/">@Santiago_KinderBueno</a> must be laughing to the bank right now

111~~~
I'm sure I heard someone at United saying he reminded them a bit of RvP as a youngster, and he started off playing wide early in his career before moving centrally.

112~~~
He was good but could have done even better with the the possible tap in for Pereira and his first chance, but looked lively and involved and it will be a huge confidence boost.

113~~~
It was suggested in the article and has Moyes quotes too. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3062396/Manchester-United-want-convert-Adnan-Januzaj-striker.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...nited-want-convert-Adnan-Januzaj-striker.html</a>

114~~~
Surprise striker scores.

115~~~
Really happy he scored. That one he missed earlier wouldn't have been good for his confidence.

116~~~
his hold up play looked as goodd as he played for u21, just let him train finishing and work on his composure and he will be a decent option out there, looked like he is more valued than Wilson now with him JAmes being played out of position to make room for Januzaj up front..

117~~~
Thanks! Didnt know that.

118~~~
Very happy to see him score, friendly or not, he needed that. Don't want a loan for him, I think he can help us this season.

119~~~
We played him as a striker quite a bit before his breakout season under Moyes to toughen up and he did well there so it's not strictly a new position, but it is at the top level.

120~~~
I remember thinking the idea of Januzaj up top was ridiculous but after he's bulked himself up and the way he performed today makes me think he does have a future there

121~~~
We should start Januzaj as our main striker. This is his time to shine!

122~~~
or probably the coach is Schweining Wilson to a Robben type

123~~~
Looked effective, strong hold up play, took his goal well and looks strong. Impressive.

124~~~
He trained well it seems, he bulked up a bit, I hope he'll have a good season.

125~~~
Chuffed for him. Really looked the part when he came on

126~~~
That helps, also I think last season he was almost trying too hard, playing up front means he has to keep it more simple and that benefitted him tonight.

127~~~
Just had a feeling when he came on that the moment he converted one of his many near misses (starting from the end of last season), he would really kick on from there. Hope I'm right and he has an excellent season for us.

128~~~
This guy is relatively new to social media but has been pretty band on with what he has claimed, transfer wise. The response to this Ben character on the 8th is rather impressive..

129~~~
Trust in Januzaj <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

130~~~

The info has to come from somewhere man. I'm simply sharing the insight from this fella. He seems accurate.

133~~~
LVG just said he was really pleased for Adnan in the post match interview.

134~~~
Funny that your email matches that guys twitter handle, eh? <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

141~~~
only pre season but I hope that helps his confidence.

142~~~
Was really happy for him tonight. Held up the ball well,  took some nice runs,  and was really pleased he converted one of his two good chances.

Think he would make an excellent striker for us.

143~~~
Love the fact he's put in the effort to strengthen up with Shaw before preseason. It's already showing. Good performance when he came on I really feel he has the talent and composure to become our main striker one day.

144~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

145~~~
Van Gaal  mentioning him again in the presser how good he played even though the question was about Memphis and Rooney... Good to see

146~~~
The talent is there. Well done januzaj

147~~~
Been watching MUTV and LVG has mentioned Adnan a few times saying he's done well

148~~~
If it were me, I'd just have said it lol

God damn Caf prejudice :P

161~~~
Van Gaal apparently praised him highly in his press conference with the written media.

162~~~
I heard one poster from Croatia (Zagreb I think) predicted LVG using Januzaj back in February. Cant remember the name. Something with some Greek god, sthing.

163~~~
He did. Journos asked him a few questions which didn't mention Adnan and he brought Adnan up saying he did well etc.

164~~~
Ouch.

165~~~
this is the first time in my life I have learned to appreciate the value of having a surveillance state<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

166~~~
You've gone too far now so you're too proud to back track and admit the mistake?

167~~~
Did the same in MUTV interview too.

Was asked about Rooney getting a goal, and brought in Adnan.

168~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> you fecking weirdo

169~~~
Looks stronger, can see hes been working on that. 

He looks a confidence player too. Think he needs minutes to improve whether thats with us or even on loan. He only turned 20 a few months ago so he will only get better.

170~~~
So the Caf's back on side, eh? Fickle bastards.

171~~~
I'm sure he will be if his performances warrant it. Certainly did today.

172~~~
He wasn't that much better than he was at times in his few games last season. If he hadn't scored that goal, everyone would be moaning that he was ineffective and 'clearly not a striker'.

He's an absurdly gifted player who, like all other players, will need proper game time if he's going to show what he can do.

173~~~
Needed that goal. Especially after missing quite an easy chance.

174~~~
I don't really remember him being particularly sharp last year. If anything, he was struggling with the mental side his game. Seems to have bulked up and gotten a bit of his Moyes era verve back this pre-season. IMO, he's a confidence player who needs to transition from blowing hot and cold into a player who can do it consistently.

175~~~
Nah, he looked a lot stronger, more confident and more purposeful then he ever did last season IMO. Maybe the odd good sub appearance, but I just don't think he's all that on the wing and that led to him playing poorly. Through the middle he just knows what he's doing and you can tell he's more comfortable, as he can hold onto it, go either way, feed players passes or run in behind. He's your classic #10 type of player, great technique on the ball, creative, but also a goal threat. He shouldn't be out wide I think.

176~~~
His best performance for a while, he looked better leading the line than playing as a #10, the goal was very reminiscent of RvP.

177~~~
Good game for Adnandos, I think after a year of learning under van Gaal, he will become a regular for us this year. In my opinion, he's still the most intriguing prospect out of all the young guys.

178~~~
I dont get why people always want to loan out players. You loan out your average talents, not your top ones. The best way to learn is to learn from the best. You won't learn much when you are surrounded by people worse then you.

We loaned out Cleverly, Welbeck, Tuna, Evans, Fabio, Macheda, Pettruci, Amos, Diouff and the list goes on and on.

Has anyone we ever loaned out came back as a succes? No. I rather have LVG training him every day and him training with the likes of Mata, Di Maria, Schweinsteiger etc then with bottom tier teams.

179~~~
I have a question: 

After he scored that goal the commentator said he got a bit lucky there. I didn't see it? How did he get lucky?

180~~~
I don't think he really played as a 10 in the first game. He played more like a striker in a 2 striker set up. If he played like a 10 he would have dropped deeper and pass the ball around a bit more.

181~~~
Well he got a lot more time because Bartra made a big mistake, sold himself easily and fell over. He still had to stick it away but the chance might have gone against a top CB

182~~~
That might be it, he certainly seemed to thrive with the extra space tonight as Pereira played quite deep behind him like a proper #10.

183~~~
Will be interesting to see where he's going to be used. High hopes for this boy and he looks committed as well. Training before pre-season starts shows how determined he is.

184~~~
I thought he did well but I think some people are getting carried away quite frankly, need better and better performances from him on a consistent basis.

185~~~
Just read page 3. No consistency in opinion either <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

186~~~
I'm still waiting on how that "Will Januzaj/Wilson make it" thread turn out <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

187~~~
Haha.  Yeh too bad i was out and about but aparently januzaj played as a striker and wilson out on the wings as i said.  It's much less confusing when you pay attention to what feet players play with.  The whole positioning of blind,  januzaj wilson are all dependant on their capabilities in space; which comes down to their stronger foot.

188~~~
Well he was shit in the previous two games but this could be a turning point for him, I believe he has the potential to be great but that remains to be seen.

189~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

There's no escaping damobot

190~~~
There is no denying how talented he is. I've always been of the opinion he'll make it and be a star. I can understand people doubting him last year, even if I don't agree with it though.

He looks a bit heavier, and stronger. That extra pre season training with the personal trainer him and Shaw took on hols with them seems to have worked.

191~~~
Took his goal very, very well. Was a good appearance overall even with the 1v1 miss. More of the same please Adnan and we'll be better for it.

192~~~
Good goal last night. RVP esque!

193~~~
Beckham ! True it was a long time ago. And can we really say that Welbeck was a failure?


If Januzaj has so little time at United like last year, it would be better for him to be loaned and improve his game. It must have been a quite frustrating year for him last year.

194~~~
That's very good actually. Will give Adnan a boost in terms of confidence.

195~~~
Opinions on here change like the wind. He was being written off by the masses not so long ago - apparently we overhyped him in his debut season - now he's the best thing since sliced bread again. No doubt he'll be heavily criticised as soon as he misplaces a pass or misses a shot in the next game. 

People just needs a bit of patience. And that goes for Januzaj, Wilson, Pereira, Lingard, Blackett and McNair. They'll all make mistakes here and there, it comes with learning the game at this level and it'll only make them better in the long run as they learn from it. They won't all make it as first choice players but the more chances they get the more likely it'll be that they develop the way we want them to.

As for Januzaj we lacked a striker at times in the U21s a couple of seasons ago and Warren Joyce played him there a few times so it wasn't completely new to him but he did well yesterday. LvG said it was probably a bit easier for him playing against a CB pairing without Piqué in it, so we probably shouldn't go over the top in our reactions, but I'm happy for him more than anything. The goal will do wonders for his confidence and hopefully he will kick on from here and do well when he gets chances in the season, regardless of what position he plays in. Very impressed in his hold up play yesterday. He looked strong and was a good focal point for us which was important as we weren't at our best in terms of keeping possession.

196~~~
He's definitely worked hard in the off season and that has proved dividends so far. I hope we give him a chance this season and don't loan him out.

197~~~
I remember seeing him smash a hattrick in an under 21 game at the start of last season upfront, thought it would help him kick back into the first team at the time. Always thought he was played there out of necessity of a lack of a reserves striker when Wilson was out, but I'll be happy to be proved wrong. So far he's looked more promising as a left winger in the first team where he has played more instinctively than through the middle or the right, which I thought would be his best positions!

198~~~
Good game and hopefully the start of something for this season....

199~~~
Don't think we'll loan him out. I can use using him at times up front.

200~~~
<a class="username" data-user="49620, @Damien" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49620/">@Damien</a> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

201~~~
He got away with a loose first touch because Bartra slipped. Otherwise Bartra probably would've cleared it. Good finish all the same. 

I don't agree at all that the goal ended up defining his performance anyway. He was very bright and lively up until that point and consistently made the right decisions.

As much as you enjoy sneering at the plebs who lack your flawless judgement on United's young players, it doesn't quite work in this case given we have quantitative evidence from just days ago that just under 2/3 of the caf think he'll make it here. It's just that following Januzaj's poor form last year the remaining third were more vocal and/or you were much more likely to notice their (strongly opposing) opinion.

202~~~
I can see Van Gaal turning him into a striker. He was making great shadow runs yesterday.

203~~~
Oh <a class="username" data-user="58573, @Gaeilge" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/58573/">@Gaeilge</a> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

204~~~
Cleverley welbeck and Evans did. The others that you mention wouldn't have made it at United anyways.

205~~~
Are you suggesting that if we had kept those players at the club instead of loaning them out that they might have been a success here?! 

Welbeck, Cleverley and Evans all benefited hugely from their loans. They still weren't good enough to become long-term first team regulars here - simply because they weren't good enough, not because of the fact they were loaned out. They also spent plenty of time playing with (and in) the United first team so you can't say that they lacked opportunity to play with the best.

206~~~
Whomever said he was a young RvP before these recent showings was spot on.

207~~~
So this was the suprise!

208~~~
Can someone post a video of the goal? I missed the match yeaterday. Cheers

209~~~
He's a lot better centrally then out wide. I still think he'll end up as a #10, but he did well up top yesterday.

210~~~

211~~~
I will claim to be the first, having first stated it here in January 2014.

212~~~
Brilliant, thanks!

213~~~
Is how I feel.

My reaction after the second pre season game was knee jerk.

He's been good in two of them now. Hope he gets lots of chances this season.

214~~~
Im suggesting that if your not good enough to get your spot in the first team after comjng through the academy tnhen you simply wont make it. And should be sold at that time.

This is the exact reason why we keep ending up with average.

Sell them with buy back clauses and learn from clubs who actually do it right.

Theres always an exception and some can be loaned which actually look really promising. But none of the players we loaned in the past ever looked that promising.

215~~~
Is anyone impressed by his hold up play in pre season? He's had a few nice RVP type hold up moments which our other strikers I.e Wilson and Rooney haven't.

216~~~
the pace with which he, Periera, Wilson and Lingard broke yesterday was very impressive

caught Barca out a couple of times

217~~~
Because footballers don't improve while sitting on their backsides. If Januzaj is going to get regular minutes then we keep him here. If he isn't, then a loan is absolutely imperative, and probably the most important decision/non-decision in Januzaj's career. Get it right and we're laughing. Mess him around and we're stifling what I think is a generational kind of talent.

218~~~
agree

219~~~
Good shout whoever that was.

<li>BY <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DAVID MCDONNELL</a></li>
</ul><span style="font-size: 18px"><b>The young forward says he wants to put his lack of form behind him and force his way into boss Louis Van Gaal's plans</b>
</span>
Adnan Januzaj</a> has vowed to put his difficult second season behind him to reclaim his <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United place.</a>

Januzaj, 20, burst on to the scene two seasons ago at United under David Moyes, but found himself marginalised last term under Louis van Gaal.

The Belgium international <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford</a>, but is determined to prove himself and has served notice of that intent this summer.

He flew to Dubai with team-mate Luke Shaw and a member of the club’s fitness staff for a week-long training camp to get in the best possible shape for the new season.

“We decided to do it because this season we both have to do better than last season,” said Januzaj.

“Last season I didn’t have many games but this year I have to be fit and get as many games as I can.

“It was our own decision to take a fitness coach from the club with us because I want to work hard and achieve something this season. I think it has helped already as I feel I am getting stronger.

“In Dubai it was about 50 degrees and it’s quite hot here in the US as well, so I think we’re used to this weather and maybe that is helping me more.

“We worked hard doing some other sports and we also worked on the pitch with the ball. When it’s 50 degrees, it is hard but hopefully it helps.”

“I like that position,” he said. "As a young player, I always played there, as a No.10.

"Only in the last two or three years have I been playing on the wing and also sometimes as a striker.” <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/adnan-januzaj-vows-prove-himself-6138061" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/adnan-januzaj-vows-prove-himself-6138061</a>

221~~~
Maybe so.

222~~~
Definitely impressed. He looks a lot stronger. LvG advised caution as it was against a Barça defence without Piqué. It'll be interesting to see him play against the likes of Thiago Silva in the game against PSG.

223~~~
Good attitude from both players. Hope they push on this season.

224~~~
FFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

225~~~
Do you think Januzaj will get much game time this season or will he end up getting loaned out? I hope not because I think the longer they're not getting opportunities at their club the more they become disconnected and start looking elsewhere.

226~~~
Fantastic goal. Bartra slipped but he done very well to bring it down like that and finish.

227~~~
I'm convinced he won't be loaned out. With European games he'll get more game time.

228~~~
He had great composure for that goal, can't wait to see him this season. He's got so much talent, just needs some game time and direction. I think he'd be able to play up alongside Rooney against a minnow team.

229~~~
Hmmm. David Beckham? Gerard Pique? <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

We shouldn't be loaning Januzaj out at this stage. But to dismiss it as an option for top talents is daft, it can be hugely beneficial if you can find the right loan.

230~~~
LvG rarely gives individual praise but on 3 separate occasions he brought up Adnan in last nights post-match interviews, he seemed genuinely excited by what he'd seen.

231~~~
he could be our Muller

232~~~
Muller was already more accomplished by 20.

Much more.

233~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> meant interns of being able to play any where across the front 4

234~~~
ah i see.

I was very impressed with januzaj yesterday. LVG could afford to let muller start at Bayern in a weaker league. He insisted that muller must play. Maybe this season could be really good for januzaj.

235~~~
i hope so. Been really hoping adnan became an important first teamer for us. with di maria off this is looking more likely. Really think hes just fantastic on form

236~~~
You're completely wrong mate.

So, what clubs should we learn from who do it right? Let's take a look.


<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

237~~~
Adnan's skill on the ball and frame allows for a lot of options once he bulked up.  Teach him to tackle and and he could be an 8, teach him to shoot and and he is a prototypical modern 9, and he has always had the skill and creativity to be a 10.   I think it was always a toss up as to where he would end up depending on what a manager saw from his play when he developed the strength to hold on to the ball in the middle.

238~~~
I think Adnan has a weird skillset right now. I think the main things he's shown he's good at are A) knocking the ball past an opponent and getting away from them. He's one of those players who gets to the ball when you think the opposition player has the advantage, it sucks them in and he's away before they know it B) His crossing from the left in his first season was good, some dangerous balls. And C) good balance. Everything else still needs a lot of work and I think you could argue that he doesn't have all the skills needed for any position right now, but some skills which fit every position he's played from the false 9 to the side of a midfield diamond.

I think Wilson is now the one we would most likely send on loan as Hernandez can provide that pace and goals while Wilson goes out, scores a good 7 goals from regular playtime at a bottom half club and improves his ability to hold off challenges and comes back less raw.

239~~~
If said talent isn't forcing his way into the side (regardless of the side), then you have to re-assess just how much of a 'top' talent they are. Probably not quite as good or ready as people think.

It's just as effective to learn from playing as it is simply training (and barely) playing with top players. I thought this was well known.

And Januzaj wouldn't be playing with people worse than him if he went on loan. People suggest a premier League loan (though I think it's ridiculously optimistic to think he'll play week in - week out) and if he did go on one, he'd definitely not be better than his team-mates at any side he joined.

And if he went to some average La Liga side, for example - he'd learn and grow from the increased responsibility and the different perspective that would offer.

240~~~
I already suggested that if you are surrounded by top players you are fine, so if Januzaj gets loaned out to lets say a Tottenham, or Valencia then sure no problem. He can play and learn a lot.

What does beat the entire purpose is when he gets send to QPR or Elche and gets hammered every week. (and these are the type of teams our youngsters normally get loaned out too) Aka team barely has possession, not players to learn a lot from and you barely get forward to attack during games.

Every single united players always says "i learned so much from scholes, giggs, rvp etc" there has to be some sort of truth behind that.

241~~~
I'm pretty sure we can all say that Welbeck was a failure. He never staked a claim to lead our line. Never good enough. Sorry. But, it's the truth.

242~~~
I agree that for a serious attacking talent that you genuinely can see as having a place in your starting eleven, a loan to a poor team is not going to do much. You want your attacker to be involved in attacks not defending/being the only attacking outlet for a team.

243~~~
I don't think he was a "failure". A failure is something like Zaha or Obertan. Welbeck was a key player in our matches against Madrid and is right now playing for Arsenal. Not a complete success but can't say it failed.

244~~~
A success is never sold to a rival club whilst still young...unless you're Mourinho and you think you're better off without Mata. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

245~~~
Not playing much for Arsenal and I think he'll play even less this season. I think we can call it a failure.

246~~~
34 games in an injury-hit season is not playing much? 

Welbeck was a solid squad player who was often trusted to play in the biggest games by SAF. Just because LVG didn't fancy him doesn't mean he was a failure, there have been plenty of good players who LVG hasn't fancied much. Even now he doesn't seem to rate Smalling and Herrera as much as the majority on here.

247~~~
Is that in all comeptitions or?
He wasnt a starter or sometimes was and sometimes wasnt. In any case he hasnt proven we were wrong to let him go and I see him in some mid table club in a year or 2.
What other good players LVG hasnt fancied much.
Also there's no proof LVG doesnt fancy Herrera and especially Smalling.

oh and Fergie trusted Cleverley in some big matches too.

248~~~
After watching the first 60 minutes with Rooney up front it was fantastic to have a striker who has a good first touch, should have scored from the first chance but it was still a great first touch. Check the run he makes for the Lingard goal and you can see that there is potential to play up front. I think it's sad that we have been in no position to ease him in because he genuinely has star potential.

249~~~
Yes it's in all competitions. 
I didn't claim we were wrong to let him go and whether or not he was a starter is a irrelevant as I'm not trying to claim he's some sort of world class player, but he was a solid squad player for us and now he's a solid squad player for Arsenal. That's his role at a top club and he fills it well.
Herrera sat on the bench for half a season while we were clamouring for him to play and is seemingly back on the bench now that LVG has signed some of his own midfielders. There's less evidence for Smalling, but he does seem to rate Jones higher since he started just about every game he was fit last season and now being left out of the 'A' team on tour. I guess we'll have to wait and see on that one.
Off the top of my head Gomez and Riquelme stand out, though I think there were more. He also preferred Young to the vastly more talented di Maria last season, while Valencia was an almost ever-present ahead of Rafael.
Welbeck was obviously a much more important player for us than Cleverly ever was.

250~~~
Rafael
Rivaldo
Riquelme
Di Maria

Oh and Welbeck was preferred to Berbatov, Hernandez and even Rooney in some cases, so your ever so clever Cleverely point is moot

and for someone who moans a lot about moaning, you moan a lot about players who contributed to our success in the Fergie years

251~~~
I didnt say they didnt contribute to our success did I?
Nor did I moan about those players. I just meant it doesnt mean much he trusted Welbeck in big games cause SAF was an expert in bringing out the most out of not very good teams sometimes. It was good then but ultimately it costed us until this day.

Dont know the story about Riquelme and Rivaldo but Rafael and ADM its the right choice it seems.

Well he preferred YOung over ADM cause of obvious reasons despite the fact how much ADM is talented. As for Herrera and Smalling yeah we have to wait and see not jump to conclusions.

252~~~
As much as a I rate him, I don't think he's a generational kind talent.

253~~~
Why would anyone care who's more accomplished at 20? Anyways Janu has way more talent than Muller.

254~~~
His movement is really good but he had me worried after he squandered the first chance.

255~~~
He's not. He'd already be in the side if he were, if we're being honest.
He'll do very well to become as good as Ozil, in my opinion.

256~~~
It would be a stupid move to loan him out. He has the quality and potential and he just needs the necessary confidence and mentality to thrive. Loaning him out will be ruining him altogether.

257~~~
Sorry, what?

258~~~
I tend to agree. Young players of his ability should be nurtured (even he's constantly just being benched and plays in reserves, it is way better than loaning him out, which more or less is a write off and it would be a shame)

259~~~
statements like this are why i tell everyone muller is one of the most underrated players in the game.

260~~~
I think he'll be one of the best players of his age range. But like I've said before, I think he might have to move for that to transpire.

261~~~
Thing with januzaj &  why i alwaya said he was centrally better than a winger was that when our wingers/forwards cut in; our central forward must have ability to manoeuvre on to the sides that are not occupied.  

More than RVP,  i rekon he is moulding in to van basten =D

262~~~
Zidane at 20 was getting a transfer to Bordeux, and he was a generational player. Dinho had only earned a transfer to PSG and he was also a generational talent. Don't think that's the reason he's not, imo the generational talent we had was Morrison, the rest of the big talents all have world class potential, and some have ballon d'or potential. 

Think he can easily be better than Ozil if used in his best position under the right set up. Personally I've never been all that impressed by the german if only due to the fact that although he's got all the tools needed to be a monster classic 10, he still has poor ball striking and generally is mediocre in front of goal.

263~~~
He's technically on a whole different level. He also has a great football brain.  
He's a very good player but he's the sort of player that's making the absolute most of his talent. Let's not lie to ourselves, there are just certain things a player like Muller will never be able to do with the ball. That's the sort of stuff the likes of Januzaj can do.  
Yeah, one of the best, but I don't think he has it in him to be the very best. I.e don't see him as a Zidane or Dinho level talent.

264~~~
That's quite different to what you first claimed, and still quite wrong.

265~~~
Wow

266~~~
you think Muller is technically on the same level as Januzaj? 
Nope, that's me justifying why I think he's got more potential than Muller.

267~~~
Muller actually has amazing technique, Januzaj has more tricks in his locker, but technique wise, Muller is one of the best around

268~~~
Do I think they are so different I would call Januzaj "Way more talented", no I don't. It's not you justifying why you think that, you're clarifying why, there's a big difference, quit now, the road is downhill for you.

269~~~
i think it's pretty funny that people were writing januzaj's obituary after the 2nd preseason game, and now one good cameo and everyone's a believer again.

unbelievably fickle. kids take time to mature and they will always have ups and downs, it would be nice if people can see that for what it is rather than jumping on him or anyone else after one subpar outting. no question about it, if he doesn't have the best cameo appearance against PSG we'll be back to where we were in this thread three days ago.

270~~~
No chance he's one of the best around. He's not even one of the best in the Bayern squad. 
Not much of a difference in this case. I made a statement and to justify that statement I gave reasons why. That justification was just clarification on the matter at hand. Pretty much everything is tied together. How's the road downhill? I think if Januzaj fulfils his potential he'll be a superior player to what muller is now. Surely that can't be that much a controversial opinion. We're not talking some once in a generation player here, we're talking about Muller.

271~~~
He's beefed up. Think he needed that. Hopefully he'll get his chances and take them.

272~~~
<b>If Rooney gets injured, how can United score enough goals?</b>

“You have seen Januzaj and in two weeks Chicharito or maybe I buy another striker. I have to evaluate always that process.” 

Seems to have quite a bit of faith in Adnan upfront. Looked good there, hopefully he'll continue to impress.

273~~~

274~~~
Perhaps it's a bit risky not to go into market for another striker but there are not many options available I guess. Anyway I can't wait for Januzaj to get his chance there even if we don't look particularly world class on the paper. I hope he takes his chances there, needs to work on his composure and finishing. He's got good enough skill set to play there otherwise, good hold up play and great creativity and movement.. he could be used as a false nine I believe..

275~~~
I'd be ecstatic if Adnan develops into a viable striking threat. He has the size, control, and finishing to do just that.

276~~~
He was unlucky not to get on given how poor Rooney was and how knackered Memphis looked in the last 20 minutes.

277~~~
If van Gaal wants a fast, strong and technical player in the number 10 role, I'd rather have Januzaj in there and Memphis playing LW with Young on the other flank. Would add a lot of strength and pace to our forward line. At lease that way Memphis can act as a wide forward with Januzaj holding up the ball instead of him. That way we have a 2nd goal threat inside the box and not just Rooney.

278~~~
This might be LVG's man utd's schweinsteiger moment.

279~~~
I think Moyes would deserve some credit for starting the process to be fair.

280~~~
Moyes never played him as a striker though, did he?

281~~~
He does not look good as an out and out striker from what I have seen. I do not understand what of his attributes makes Van Gaal believes he will be good for us in that role.

282~~~
Did once or twice, against Chelsea and against Fulham. Perhaps he just doesn't like him out wide in West London.

283~~~
Depends on your definition of the role. It has evolved, so so long as a winger has an instinct and some strength, he can play up front. Other than a few exceptions, looking for a striker with 'traditional strikers attributes' would usually mean looking for one who is a bit limited.

284~~~
The problem is, I do not see any poacher esque instinct, pace or even strength(moreso that he has balance) in his ability that he needs to be a good striker. A false 9 is more fitting as that gives him more freedom to take players on and perhap create which might suit him much more.

285~~~
Disappointed not to see him. Thought he should've gotten a cameo

286~~~
Mate he wasnt even on the bench!

287~~~
Injured? Sent to far North?

288~~~
Yeah he should've been on the bench.

289~~~
Cringed today when I saw he hadn't even made the bench, he needs to push for a loan, can't afford to waste another season sitting around twidling his thumbs just because he doesn't fit LvG's perfect mold.

290~~~
Missed him today

291~~~
Agreed. Slap in the face that Hernandez who had zero preseason and was injured got in ahead of him.

292~~~
We needed at least one striker on the bench dont you agree.

293~~~
I do. But I thought that's what Adnan is now? If not, then what the hell is he to LVG?

294~~~
Better to have a proven striker than one how could maybe be a striker. I bet he'll be on the bench in the next game. 
Pereira was on the bench today which I really liked tbh.

295~~~
Johnson out for a couple of months. Maybe they'll push for Adnan?

296~~~
Seems like he's starting. Big opportunity for him to shine.

297~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

298~~~
Hopefully he plays a blinder. He's young, but he could do with a decent season.

299~~~
unexpected to come straight in like this

300~~~
Really pleased to see him start, hopefully behind Rooney!

301~~~
Definitely. If LVG has some faith in him starting though, it indicates to me that he's not going out on loan at all.

302~~~
Brilliant news. Come on adnan.

303~~~
Will be interesting to see how they lineup because LvG already called Januzaj a striker, so maybe Memphis lines up on the left and Mata on the right with Januzaj playing behind Rooney.  All-in-all very excited to see Januzaj get the start, however, I wonder if it is more to silence doubts about his future than to actually play him over someone like Young.  Hopefully if he plays well he can retain his role (whatever role that is) for the rest of the season.

304~~~
Thought LVG would stick with Memphis in the middle and put Januzaj out right, but it seems like he may actually be in behind Rooney. A lot of faith from LVG in him.

305~~~
This will be interesting.  Cannot hazard a guess as to where the next three will line up behind Rooney....

306~~~
he needs to perform today.

307~~~
That's what she said...

308~~~
Come on Adnan Silva!!!! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

309~~~
Big opportunity for him today, really hope he can impress.

310~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

311~~~
Have a feeling he will, otherwise LvG wouldn't take the chance. He's probably been great in training.

312~~~
LvG is trying to do something with the #10 role looking at the players he's been giving a chance there. I'm not sure what it is and how its going to work out but something is sure happening out of the ordinary.

313~~~
He certainly bulked up a fair bit, should come in handy in a tough away game.

314~~~
Interchanging front 4 would be nice if it came off. Unleash them Louis!

315~~~
Could be saying "Pedro Who?" by the end of this. Januzaj isnt going to get a better chance to show what he's got than tonight. No excuses for him. The talent is obviously there and always has been. He needs to perform. He's getting linked to shite like Sunderland of all places. If that doesnt motivate you to prove yourself, nothing will.

316~~~

317~~~
Good job Van Gaal for giving him an opportunity. I am finally actually please with a decision he has made despite the possibility of the end not justifying the means.

318~~~
If he's playing behind Rooney, he'll be spectacular

319~~~
Delighted that he is getting a chance. I hope he is on the right, with Mata central and Depay on the left. If he is central then that's okay but if he is on the left and Depay is in the middle again I will be mutter nasty things about Van Gaal under my breath.

320~~~
He's done nothing so far but you can just feel the quality oozing off of him.

321~~~
BOY WONDER!!

322~~~
And he scores <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

323~~~
*cough, cough* young man <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

324~~~
Great goal.. was poor before it though, hopefully his confidence grows with it

325~~~
Just terrified by 2 year old by my scream of YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!

326~~~
I can't take the strain!

327~~~
haha well I could see it coming! I got chills with that play. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

328~~~
Big goal. That turn was nice.

329~~~
feck the h8ers

330~~~
Great run from the lad, coming into the game well!

331~~~
This cnut is playing better than the seniors. Do not loan him!

332~~~
Lovely stuff. That's likely earned him a starting spot for the next month. Louis's nothing if not a performance-reward man.

333~~~
Does anyone hate Januzaj?

Anyway, he's doing well!

334~~~
Fully agree.

335~~~
It's not just the goal, the kid has moved around really well.

336~~~
The physicality of playing central was a hudle at the start of the half but he has grown into it and took his goal with excellent composure.

337~~~
I'm watching a different game to others I think? Great goal, but other than that he lost the ball a host of times, was knocked to the ground far too easily also. Hopefully he'll grow into the game after the goal though.

338~~~
Lovely goal

339~~~
Pleased for him. He needed that.

340~~~
He has played the position well and, importantly, he has not let himself get caught ahead of the play when we're defending. The big gap that opened up between our #10 and our double pivot against Spurs isn't there tonight. That's in large part down to the intelligent running Januzaj has done. His finish was immense, but we've known for ahead Janzuaj can do stuff like that. What's really impressed me so far is how, he hasn't just run a lot, he's been intelligent enough to know when and where to go. I've always had my doubts about Adnan as a #10 but playing like this, maybe his wing days are and should be over?

341~~~
Good movement, needs to hold the ball up better, but his movement and energy has been very good for us. Glad he scored today, major confidence boost

342~~~
Held up the ball pretty well too, better than Memphis did against Spurs IMO. It'd be great if he can do this on a consistent level.

343~~~
Finding it tough with the heavy marking but composure as good as anyone for his goal. Putting Rooney to shame.

344~~~
Thought he was very poor except for the goal. Far too weak on the ball.

345~~~
He still is bit struggling against the aggressive villa players bit physically at times but way better than before. Also referee gives him no protection.

Anyway the goal showed his class.

346~~~
Usually I'm on the "don't fall so easily"-side, but in Adnan's case, it's become ridiculous. You can only hold your ground for so long while being fouled.

347~~~
I don't think anyone's pretending he's been Zizou-esque. But then nobody has. He's rewarded the manager's faith and made the difference. S'all that matters right now.

348~~~
Needs to protect the ball better but has been good other than that. Took the goal beautifully.

349~~~
He's being man marked very aggressively, it stands to reason that he'll lose a lot of battles. It's what he does when he turns his man that counts, and his reward for it was a goal. 

He's playing well in a very competitive Villa midfield trio.

350~~~
Turned well for the goal, but a bit lightweight and easily bullied. Been fouled a few times but a lot of just being out muscled.

351~~~
Not to sound very cliché but he needs to add a good bit of weight to his upper body. He would then be able to manage those shoulder to shoulder a lot better.

352~~~
I thought the ref could have given him a couple of free-kicks in that first half. Well taken goal but otherwise he needs to lose his markers a bit better.

EDIT: It also highlights why van Gaal has experimented with Memphis at #10 and why he probably don't fancy Mata there.

353~~~
Not an easy game for him with a very physical Villa midfield.Classy goal.

354~~~
good goal and good movement, but he looks weak on the ball, needs to find a way not to get thrown on his ass every time he gets teh ball.

355~~~
His touch and control in close spaces is a breath of fresh air after having endured Rooney for a while.

356~~~
Very happy for him today. Great run, great finish... Perhaps even better pass by Mata to find him in the first place.

357~~~
United's top scorer <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

358~~~
I'd still loan him out. I thought he was suppose to be bulking up...

Needs game time man!! If we can give him that here keep him.

359~~~
So pleased for him.

360~~~
Proved me wrong. I thought he would perform terribly in this game, especially with Villa being so physical. Great run and good goal. Pushed off the ball a couple of times, but with time he'll develop more physically and not be pushed around so much.

361~~~
He has bulked up.

He's also scored our last two goals, with a lot fewer minutes than a lot of others here.

362~~~
Not to mention this is his first competitive start after 6 months.Will only get better next game (if he does start).

363~~~
Needs to get a bit stronger but other than that I thought he was decent. Certainly better than Rooney

364~~~
Well done lad, needs more games and we will see more from him.

365~~~
Needs to pack on some more muscle, constantly bullied off the ball today. Glad that he got his goal though.

366~~~
Lvg did not sound too pleased with his overall performance though praised his goal.

Hmm almost seemed to sound like loan was a option too.

367~~~
He wasn't great but scored.

Needs games. Don't know why we played Mata wide either, Januzaj should of played on the right.

368~~~
Great goal. A bit meh apart from that sadly.

369~~~
Yeah he hasn't developed physically enough in the last two years. I think it will be his downfall. Still think he's more influential on the wing.

370~~~
I think it's very hard to be too critical of Januzaj, Mata or Memphis when they were the 3 who linked for the goal and when the striker they were trying to support doesn't have the discipline to be in the box.

They just showed the graphic and Adnan's average position was perfect for a no.10 today. The problem was the average position of his no.9 was behind him.

371~~~
Because other than the goal he was rubbish.. But like most have said. He needs game time.

372~~~
He was very good in the first half and mentally much more comftable in the middle than Depay the first game. Brilliant timed run for the goal, took the defender out naturally with a bit of skill and finished it deservedly somehow. He deserves his chance and looked much more like the Adnan of 2013/14.

373~~~
Still getting kicked up and down the pitch, he'll just have to get stronger and learn to withstand the abuse because Prem referees will not blow the whistle much in his favor, it seems. Could be more like Memphis in this regard.

Still showed his talent and class, not just with his goal but in several places where he found a teammate nicely under pressure or showed good touches. All in all, decent performance after being out of the team for so long, let's hope he will get more time this season.

374~~~
Completely agree with van Gaal. Really careless in general and nowhere near the standards he reached in his first season bar that one moment of brilliance. Herrera was much better in the 30 mins he played.

375~~~
I love Adnan but sadly I agree.

376~~~
Got a decent 60 minutes under his belt, struggled at times but he'll only find his footing with games.

377~~~
Thought he looked his normal self to be honest but the whole team lacked composure for most of the game. Don't think he's up to much at 10.

378~~~
Scored a good goal.

He was just a little rusty today, and too careless, but I think those two go hand in hand.  There was one passage of play in the last 10 minutes or so before he was subbed when the team was on the counter when Mata (I think) played a clever ball to Adnan in the middle of the field.  Adnan then held up the ball well enough, allowing Mata, Depay and Rooney to get in really promising positions.  If he would have played the right ball it could have been a deadly counter-attack, instead he held onto the ball too long, was tackled, and Villa broke really quick and created a chance.  Something I think LVG would have been fuming over with his constant emphasis on control.

379~~~
Tbf its not like others in attack were pulling up any trees either.

Memphis in the 2 games so far has been similar standard without a goal and Rooney probably worse. And Januzaj has probably less match fitness than them.

380~~~
Wouldn't worry about him getting bullied. Gueye did a good job closing down on players and Richards is a freak.

381~~~
I'd like him getting a go at the same role vs Brugge. Bound to have more space and also protection.

382~~~
What did Herrera really do in the last 30 min?

383~~~
I think people need to realize that Gaal likes his #10s to be more like strikers than midfielders which is why Adnan isn't going towards the ball as a 10 like he would usually play the position.

Next time he just needs to be more aware of the kind of physicality a team has and adjust accordingly. Like you said, playing as a 10 vs Brugge would probably be a bit easier on the physical side compared to Villa.

384~~~
Controlled the midfield basically?

385~~~
I would say Bastian had a bigger role in that.Herrera also lost the ball a few times.Not a criticism on him though.

386~~~
LVG only has one way of dealing with players, and that is to point out all the mistakes they made. The perfect match in his head would look like 11 robots that never gave the ball away once in 90 minutes.

If Adnan has a lot to improve on, then i dread to think what he thought of Rooney's performance hehe.

387~~~
Thought he was generally poor bar his goal.

388~~~
Bastian calmed it down yes but Herrera was the one doing the runs and passing/receiving the ball in the midfield. Got fouled a couple of times which allowed the others to take a breather.

389~~~
Pretty much what LVG said after the match

390~~~
Didn't see anything after the match but that seems a fair assessment from LvG. Had he not scored, it would have been a really poor performance. He has talent but he's not happening for him for some reason.

391~~~
Needs game time, has to go on loan because he aint up to speed for us.

392~~~
Pretty mediocre imo. Got lucky with the goal and was routinely bossed by whichever Villa defender was nearby.

393~~~
I liked how he celebrated the goal, calm and circumspect, like a guy who knows his work isn't done.

394~~~
Doesn't sound Van Gaal was too impressed. Criticized him for his ball losses.

395~~~
Nice to see van Gaal's decision to start him paid off. I'm glad he got given the chance tonight because he is a very talented player and not just some flash in the pan. Not sure if I agree with Redknapp's assessment that he's more talented than Depay however.

396~~~
Took his goal well, but he's not a number 10, in my opinion. At least not the type of number 10 i'm looking for. Memphis the same. 

Van Gaal wants runners in the 10 position, but we need someone who's going to get on the ball and control it (see Silva against West Brom), especially now that we're playing with two out and out defensive midfielders. Let the striker and wingers do the running off the ball and occasionally one of the defensive midfielders if we're pushing for a goal.

397~~~
Our entire front four were all a bit wasteful and rusty.
He still got the goal, 
I'm sure van gaal would disagree but i think you need to humour some attacking players a bit and let them away with the odd loose pass for the goals they give you.
Thought the ref was pretty lenient tonight throughout (no complaints from me, kept the match moving mostly and didn't put up with diving)
and villa look like a pretty physical side now to me. He'll have easier games.

I'd probably drop him for hererra tbh but still thought it was a decent performance.

398~~~
That's the thing, he is a young player and should be encouraged to go out there and perform. He is an attacking player and will lose the ball more often, and he with his lack of experience, it will slightly worse than another player. Keep that shit private and have a word with the player, but don't announce that in public. I want to hear what he had to say about Rooney today.

399~~~
The build-up to his goal was him winning the physical battle, but that was an anomaly. Showed immense composure for the goal, though you could say the finish was fortunate. Not an impressive performance and 29 touches is mediocre for a #10, but that doesn't matter. He's only played a handful of games as a #10 for the first team and has never been given a run in that position. Hopefully this increases his confidence and he goes onto have a good season for us.

400~~~
Could we drop Rooney and play him up top?

401~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/edlgmJKDXuU/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

402~~~
He needs to be stronger on the ball

403~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What a wacist!!!

404~~~
Obviously not after tonight's display.

405~~~
A goal in the first half from Adnan Jenanji urh Janu jack <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

406~~~
Bit of Janu Jazz from the little master Januzaj.

Thought he was poor though, really don't think either Memphis or Janu have covered themselves in glory at the 10 spot. He still for me looks like he needs to go back to the Moyes season and re-discover his ability to carry the ball. What made him excellent was his no fear attitude and his ability to just get it and go, no questions asked. I feel in this 10 role he's a bit stunted, he found it hard to link up play and be in the right areas all the time. Fell over a bit. 

Get him out wide on the ball for matter and give him freedom to get the ball and j-.... Oh shit, Van Gaal's coming shhh boys..... No mate, possession football ay... Yep..

407~~~
Agreed.

But i think that's down to Van Gaal vs Moyes.

Moyes would have given him the freedom and told him to run at players.

Van Gaal HATES wasted possession and under him is probably more instructed whenever he receives the ball to look for a pass etc... probably sideways.

408~~~
Moment of brilliance, but what was reassuring was Van Gaal picked up that he lost the ball quite easily a fair few times.

I'm sure there'll be a few possession v pressure training exercises to work on that.

409~~~
I think his own personal attitude as well. He's clearly into himself and his ability, you can tell. Van Gaal doesn't rate that and the basic path to selection is about demonstrating that you can do what the manager says without doing the things he doesn't like, while Moyes had this young guy with clear ability on the ball and he had no pressure on him (being unknown helped a lot as well). He looks like he's trying to learn and trying to play the way Van Gaal wants but I see it more as a <i>put this kid on downhill rails and watch him fly</i>, at the moment LVG has put him at the bottom a hill and he's scrambling around trying to look the part while looking for some way to get up on those rails.

You are correct, complete role reversal.

410~~~
I watched a recap on German TV, it was worse. The guy called him Junuzei.

411~~~
The positives:
- the goal
- his movement off the ball and his decent passing

The negatives:
- him losing the ball to easily when he has it and not fighting back right away, his defensive mentality has to improve as well


With that being said, van Gaal has to get his head out of his ass too. With players such as Januzaj and Depay, you can't be furious with them losing the ball. They live off of taking risks amongst other things. He's just putting unnecessary limitations on their games.

412~~~
His vision and first touch are very good. He's just too eager to keep it even when under pressure, his dribbling and footwork aren't that special and he is nowhere near strong enough for the Prem yet, so he loses the ball a lot.

Brilliant run and move for the goal. 

I really do think he'll be a great player for us, but I still wouldn't mind him going on loan, if we do sign Pedro. Newcastle started Obertan this week, so there are certainly spots out there for him to play while working on his game and body.

413~~~
If we were going purely on what we've seen so far in the first 2 games, I'd have Herrera as the 10 and Januzaj (or even Young, who might be clueless up there but will work hard and has more pace than Rooney and did set up the Walker own goal while temporarily playing as a 9) up top.

414~~~
Thats the issue, is he and out and out attacker with flair or an all round player? LVG seems to think that he should be doing more, and maybe he should, but I think by making him concentrate on other aspects makes him loose the flair. Ronaldo was never a great defender and lost the ball many times. Losing the ball should not be a crime when trying something positive. During the Villa game when he lost the ball it was when he was playing sideways or back.

415~~~
Took the goal well but was bullied pretty easily. The game should help him get some confidence and match 'rhythm' back.

416~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JIyu8klCg7s?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

417~~~
Missed the game, but watching that clip above, other than the goal he was a bit rubbish. Basically every time he got the ball he was bullied off it an gave it away. He simply isn't strong enough to play in a congested middle right now. Why I prefer if we play him wider, which gives him more time and space on the ball.

418~~~
Delighted for him.

He did tire as the game went on and he admitted to lacking match fitness after the game which isn't surprising. But he looked bright in that first half and the combination of him in the middle and depay on the left looked interesting to me.

At the end of the day I think his potential as a number 10 is huge. His close control is of the level you need in that position. It's just a case of being patient with him and him learning to adapt to dealing with tought premier league defenders. I hope we see a lot more of him as a number 10.

419~~~
Also, quality work for the goal. He and memphis showed glimpses of their skill. More of that please.

420~~~
Pace!! I like

421~~~
This was his first start in a long time. He will get better with more playing time

422~~~
I hope he can get some more playing time this season. He wasn't sensational but that certainly was a promising first start for him this season.

423~~~
Great composure for the goal. 

Other than that it was a bit of a shit performance from him. We look disjointed in attack.

A couple of promising moments though and I thought it was a shrewd decision by LVG to play him.

424~~~
Except for the goal and a couple more flashes here and there he wasn't that good. But he lacks match fitness, I hope LVG doesn't drop him and allows him to build on the confidence he surely got from this goal.

425~~~
after they way he played, I would say not a chance, did well for the goal, but for me that was it, he had a pretty crap game.

426~~~
His decision making still needs serious addressing pronto. Some of those dribbles to nowhere and ball dwelling moments when opportunities for good possession or to release Memphis was on.

He scored and even I can't fault him for that but I'd prefer to see Herrera as the 10 in this phase of the season under these tactics.

427~~~
LVG was right. Great moment, but needs to work on other areas of his game....simples...

428~~~
Agreed with that. He needs to work on his awareness though. Most of the time he seems to lose possession because he's not aware of what is around him, who can provide him with quick passes and good 1-2 to unlock. But his control is brilliant.
Another issue is he tries too hard to beat players with his pace (which isn't great), this leads to him losing out to pacy players. With better awareness he could also improve on that.

429~~~
Bullied at times.Thought he played well and took his opportunity with composure.

430~~~
Well taken goal but thought he was disappointing on the ball. Lost possession way too much and not strong enough on the ball.  When he receives the ball in his mind he should know what to do. Look at tiger or Mata for instance when receiving the ball. They have a picture in their head and execute it so well. Bit more of that please

431~~~
I'm confident many of those things will come. Kid needs to play now and become a real part of the team. And I still feel he's good enough to do that here this season to a decent extent.  One thing he does have either way is to produce pieces of skill to change games. And we can use that presently.

432~~~
Hope so. I am very confident awareness of any player gets better with experience and he's going to get much better as he matures. For now, he's a hit and miss though. He scored a good goal but lost the ball loads of time and played very few passes that you'd expect of a number 10 to make our attack look fluid.

433~~~
If we're not gunna bring in Pedro (still think we will) then I want to see us try out Januzaj on the right hand side, Louis loves inverted wingers and we'd get to see Mata in the hole as well.

434~~~
First start in 6 months. 20 years old. Playing away in a defensive turgid system and takes a goal well. I'll take it. Yes he gave away the ball but LVG's butchering of him after the game was ridiculous. 

It might be worth pointing out that Januzaj has scored in his two most recent appearances while nobody else has in between.

435~~~
But then where does Memphis fit in?

436~~~
On the left?

437~~~
It was a good goal. He has class but lacks confidence. Still very young.

438~~~
Good goal from him, apart that was a bit surprised that he was pushed away form the ball easily, his hold up play is usually quite good.. anyway glad to see him back:-)

439~~~
This is the final nail in the coffin for him for me:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.football365.com/manchester-united/9950310/Adnan-Janzuaj-could-be-the-key-to-Manchester-United-s-striker-shortage-Jamie-Redknapp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.football365.com/manchest...ster-United-s-striker-shortage-Jamie-Redknapp</a>

440~~~
Memphis - Mata - Januzaj

441~~~
Most likely due to not playing enough recently. It would help if he got a run of games now for his 'swagger' to return.

442~~~
Pleased for him to get the goal. Had an okay game overall, with some nice moments on top of the goal. Obviously still has a lot in his game to develop, but definitely a positive showing for him.

443~~~
"he didn't have a great game" could be labeled at any of the attackers against Villa, the fact Januzaj scored makes his performance better than most, so i hope he keeps his place and gets another chance

444~~~
Never mind - I misread it as if we <i>were</i> going to bring in Pedro.

445~~~
If he is dropped for the next game then it beggars belief. First of all the question was why did he come from not playing at all against Spurs to then starting against Villa? It was a lot to ask for him to perform. If he's now dropped then questions need to be asked. He should be allowed a good run of games to show what he can do, not just one game from nothing.

446~~~
Another very poor half I thought. Either needs to be moved to the wing or taken off. Lost the ball numerous times.

447~~~
We have a winger playing 10 and a 10 playing as a winger and we all wonder why both players struggle.

448~~~
He's done OK. Movement improving all the time.

But him and Rooney are too close most time

449~~~
Thought he started brightly enough but his head began to drop. Would have been a soft penalty but have seen them given for less!

450~~~
Thought his flicks and tricks were really good, the big problem with him is that he looks as light as a feather.

451~~~
Thought he's done well so far.

452~~~
I don't think Januzaj is a winger actually. I'm more comfortable with the fact that Van Gaal is playing him centrally.

453~~~
Wow, really? I honestly must be watching a different game. Constantly either giving it away or getting knocked off the ball too easily.

454~~~
I thought he bulked up? He does still look pretty light.

455~~~
Why does he look so weak.. his body strength used to be one of his best attributes.

456~~~
Januzaj isn't a winger. He's played as an attacking midfielder all of his life until the last 2 years. I don't think they're struggling either.

457~~~
Really weak at times. Shows too much of the ball to opposition defenders at times too.

458~~~
Nice start, faded after that.

459~~~
Quite invisible so far.

460~~~
You probably are. Only thing I didn't like is that he can't seem to find good positions when we attack, he seems a bit static.

461~~~
I like what he did, he will only get better if we play him regularly.

462~~~
Is he still playing? How's he doing? 

Also, he is not a winger. I get really frustrated when he plays on the wing.

463~~~
Badly. Needs to be taken off.

464~~~
He fades after about half an hour, for some reason.

465~~~
I have never been convinced by him as a 10. He just isn't mature enough in his game for that role yet.

466~~~
Really? He seems more immature as a winger always trying to dribble past players. As a 10 he seems more controlled only dribbling when he has to and generally being more in the game.

About the only thing he lacked today was a great pass to create that great scoring chance. He attempted it, but it barely didn't come off. I believe his touch compilation will reflect that. He didn't lose the ball anymore than the other players this time either so no idea why those complaints have come up again. Last match he obviously lost the ball a lot and was bullied. The only time you could say he was bullied was that one time he could have given himself a great opportunity to score.

467~~~
He just needs that extra bit of composure, but I'm glad he's going past people again.

468~~~
He was fine overall. Certainly improved over villa.

Still lacks bit of composure and ability to hold off people though. That will probably come.

469~~~
He needs to sort those over hit final passes out. I counted 3 promising attacks that he cocked up with Bebe type of passing.

470~~~
Did well to begin with but faded out of the game. Again he's getting pushed about a bit too much.

471~~~
I thought he did ok. Similar standard to Mata and Rooney but way below Memphis. Had a few nice moments and a few poor touches too.

472~~~
Disappointing. Too slow, too wasteful with the ball.

473~~~
A loan is just what he needs I think.

474~~~
There's something there. It will click for him and then he'll be brilliant.

475~~~
This is how I felt. Similar to Mata and Rooney, but not close to Memphis who was the standout player.

476~~~
I thought he was good. Not through entire game but he'll get there eventually, some very good moments that neither of our attacking players offer at number ten.

477~~~
There were good opportunities for passes that he somehow fecked up.

478~~~
Final ball didn't come off but he just needs games games games. Let's see if LVG can afford giving him that in the no.10 position

479~~~
I think he had a decent game, no need to be hyper critical. He made some mistakes, but he also did some very good things too and created a few chances.
More game time and I can see him being as good as Memphis, he definitely seems to have the talent and we know he has an eye for goal

480~~~
Give him time. He is making the right runs, but since he is so match unfit so his range of passing is a bit off. I thought his off the ball movements were really really good today, unfortunately on the ball he was average but so was rooney and maybe mata as well

481~~~
He played well, kept the ball better, great with the ball at his feet and made some good passes into space still needs to improve.

482~~~
I thought he was poor. His passing was poor tonight, simple passes were mishit.

483~~~
He was absolutely fine. Keep him and keep giving him minutes, he's only going to improve.

484~~~
Had his good and bad moments, but generally fine. Hope he gets a run, like him at the 10, especially with Mata floating around everywhere

485~~~
To the right team though. A bad loan move will hinder his development. Some were calling for the Sunderland loan move but no way would that do him and favours.

486~~~
He was the only one in the 1st half that looked remotely likely to create something. Needs to improve his strength at shielding the ball but he needs more games to do that and improve overall. Question is will he get the number of games here?

487~~~
His position in the team is one of the reasons we were playing some eye catching, fluid football. Great performance from Adnan, hopefully he keeps his place in the team.

488~~~
Not a great day for him but he may be trying too hard to impress. I liked his movement and energy in the role even if his passing was a little off key, considering he has never had a run in this position before (in the 1st team) and didn't exactly get a lot of playing time last season it is understandable that he looks a little rusty and anxious. You could see what he was trying but the execution was off.

Went quiet in the second half but if he gets regular football I can see him making an impact in that role. We'll have to see how the potential Pedro deal effects the pecking order at #10.

He is lightweight and pushed off the ball too easily at times but it is a trade-off as it also allows him to float/ghost past players in an effortless manner. Once he learns to use his body a bit better it won't be such a big issue.

489~~~
Need him on the wing and Mata in the middle. Once van Gaal realises this, I think this is where we will see our most dangerous plays coming from. Having extra pace on the right to join Darmian will work wonders, with Mata pulling the strings from the middle.

490~~~
Thought he had a good first half but was out of the second. Some nice tricks on show so his confidence is coming back

491~~~
It's weird, he seems to play in a way where he thinks he's much faster then he actually is... And then seems completely bemused when the things he tries don't work... Because he's not as quick as he thinks he is.

492~~~
^Yes it was weird, it's as if his bulk (being top heavy now) has affected his mobility a bit and/or he hasn't got match sharpness yet. 

Once he finds that, I think we'll see the much more incisive Januzaj that we all love. The decision making may still take longer than that but even today he showed lovely bits of skill, ball control, body feints etc. Lovely to watch on the eye of course and depending on your view, maybe perhaps ineffective but those are signs of a really classy player. If he gets the opportunities to display those in a more fluid Utd team, who knows, he might start show more than just potential.

Please give him regular game time LVG. He is showing improvement, let's nurture it whilst his fire is still strong. Not getting playing time even for a young and mature player like him must be mentally cumbersome.

493~~~
Not sure if he was good or bad really. Plenty of really good moments, but then he always has inconsistent moments and needlessly mishits passes. Once he finds that consistency in his game though, he'll become a top player. Definitely looks like he has it in him to look like a top class #10 for us. He makes some very good runs and is great at dribbling past players in tight spaces, but just needs to have it all click at once basically. That will come with time.

494~~~
Just watching the game now. I think Januzaj is looking very good? Making runs out wide which is perfect for Memphis/Mata who likes to cut in and he's made some pretty great plays so far. Almost set Rooney through at the first minutes of the game and it should have possibly been a goal. Just half way in so will edit it later.

495~~~
I think it was him in the second half down near the tunnel, went past a defender so easily. We might have won a corner from it. Can't remember

Happy to see him get time

496~~~
Started off on fire, he had frustrating moments and he dropped his head for periods. Memphis, gave the ball away plenty of times, he didn't drop his head, just believed next time he gets the ball he would make something happen.

Confidence for you.

497~~~
He needs to learn to use his increased size to his advantage better.  

Also needs to improve his final ball, but that can be said for just about every forward ever that is his age.

498~~~
Is it possible we are playing him and putting him in the shop window until Pedro arrives? If we do get Pedro then that's another attacker he will have to compete with for a spot. Probably am wrong but just an alternative perspective.

499~~~
He doesn't seem to learn from his mistakes. His decision making was poor at times. Hope Van Gaal sorts him out.

500~~~
I thought he was OK.

What I'm happy about is there seems to be some vision to his play. He has good ideas but he's just not quite composed enough to execute them yet. But I think that composure should come with more game time.

501~~~
played very well. better in this match than the Villa one.

502~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1-DrmP8USo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

503~~~
Thought he was very good, it's only natural to lose the ball a couple of times in those tighter positions. He looked a threat at the very least.

504~~~
Positive signs, always looking to move forward with the ball which is good to see, added some pace and directness.

505~~~
Decent runs, but poor decision making let him down quite a bit. He's going to get an earful from LvG. He'll need to tighten up his game quickly if he wants to stay in the starting line-up. Or maybe it's time to give Pereira a chance.

506~~~
Feck me!  A 20 year old pulling the strings for one of the biggest clubs in the world fighting to get back to their rightful place in CL.

I thought he was good - what I liked today is the when he did give the ball away it was trying to create and wasn't in a dangerous spot.

Two starts - since February - I'll take it as it only gets better from here.

507~~~
I thought he did ok tonight, I especially liked how he was switching with Memphis in a fluid manner when we attacked. We just need to keep playing him in the role and giving him a chance to develop into it and build his confidence and experience.

508~~~
Thought a few of his passes were by carrick during the game.
Good person to be mistaken for?
I'm glad to see him playing, thought it was a decent performance but not great (some of them passes were very nice though)

509~~~
Yes he did. Even Ronaldo needed more than just a season to become what he is now, or at least 70-90% of him now. If Janu continues this trend of working hard post season, he will become good for United, if not great.

510~~~
Some lovely little touches in the clip. I'm all for continuing with him and letting him grow into the role.

511~~~
Exactly, what game were people watching. He was very good tonight, yes his decision making and passing wasn't the best at times but neither was Rooney or Memphis for example. This is a learning curve and a platform to build from, its not like hes had plenty of game time, the talents all there he just needs to put it together.

512~~~
Januzaj really does have some serious trickery. I don't think the ability to beat defenders can be understated either. Van Gaal wanted more pace and creativity, well Januzaj is a player that can open the play up with a pass or a run on his own. Wouldn't surprise me to see him get a third straight start against Newcastle. He's still a little bit light to be a striker (point forward mid?) for me but he does have a lot of attributes for the role he's playing now

513~~~
Some lovely runs and touches, some are bad touches and passes. As what LvG said in the PC, consistency is his main issue at the moment. He has the talents, just have to make sure he produces it consistently. A run of games would definitely help the young guy, now that the team are more settled and less pressure on him as compared to Moyes' reign. With the right coaching and management, I am sure he will be fine this season.

514~~~
To me, he almost has a free-role playing just off the striker and not really stuck at the wings as well compared to Memphis last night. He plays better than Memphis at that position I reckon and will only grow into this role if given the chance.

515~~~
<a class="username" data-user="67446, @MoneyMay" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/67446/">@MoneyMay</a> - thx for the compilation. Just love watching the way he manipulates the ball at his feet. Overall a solid performance - hope he continues to get his chances.

516~~~
He does have really good touch and ball control. He just needs to improve on his passing and decision making. He showed flashes today of his brilliant control and then some inconsistent passing. He might had even scored a goal had he been a smart finisher. But all in all, he showed improvement and probably deserves a claim to start against Newcastle. The problem with these youngsters is all about consistency. Only Messi, Muller, Neymar were a few that were consistent right from beginning. If he can improve consistently and also be consistent, he can make it here. He needs to work on his finishing as well if he is to play as a number 10.

517~~~
The biggest problem with this lad is his decision making he never seems to pick the right option when under pressure. He is still a kid with very little experience at the top level, I hope Giggs has a meeting with him or something to show him the type of mistakes he makes. Its all really avoidable and I think theres a lot of room for improvement in his game.

518~~~
His movement was top notch. Hope to see him start again, people need to remember that he's still 20.

519~~~
I thought off the ball he was fantastic last night off the ball, running beyond Rooney, drifting into wide areas to create space. Showed flashes of his ability on the ball but then had some really sloppy moments. It's there where he really needs to improve. I do like him centrally though, I think he's better in that position than Depay was when we saw him there. Promising start to the season for him.

520~~~
What he gives us is ability to beat a player in a central area.  It's natural that he'll mix the good with the bad in games but I expect to see this getting better with the more game time he is given.  His main thing to work on in the 10 role is receiving/shielding the ball under pressure and knowing when to keep it simple.  Both these things come with experience of the role.  Also don't forget that he is surrounded by players who haven't hit top form or are still settling into the club.  If/when the likes of Mata, Rooney, Schneiderlin, BFS etc get into top gear it will be much easier for him and Depay to show their worth.  I hope he starts against Newcastle.

521~~~
What I like about the trio Memphis-Januzaj-Mata is their ability to interchange position, especially Januzaj who has no problem playing centrally or drifting to left or right wing or even moving up front at times when Rooney dropped deep.That would be valuable to LVG's tactics.No reason to change what is working.

522~~~
Some good stuff and some not so good stuff. Started the game brilliantly. The pass on the turn to Rooney, beating his man on the wing etc. He will frustrate at times as he's still maturing as a footballer, but even now, he does bring a bit of class to the table. If he can coupl that with reliability over time, he'll be some player. 

Also he belongs in he centre IMO.

523~~~
His close control and dribble-brain is at an exceptionally high level. A few of those touches he was already engineering the touch away from the defender before the defender know he was going to press and make the challenge. I think he's a very very good instinctive dribbler. I think in a perfect world we'd get him into spaces where we just say <i>Right Adnan, heres the ball its a 1 on 3, beat all of these guys and make something for an assist or goal. </i>Although young, he really is an exceptional talent with the ball at his feet in my view.

524~~~
Agreed with this, we do need to take a step back and acknowledge that we were playing an injury hit team but even so, the movement and trickery displayed in the first half in particular was very promising given our recent performances. Januzaj was at times excellent but did make a few errors which is only natural when returning to match sharpness but the signs were there that he looks like a viable first team option again. I was very impressed, looked really dangerous and caused their defense all kinds of problems.

525~~~
He needs minutes and then things will come off. He's too good to not make it

526~~~
As long as we are winning games then it would be best to keep.developing him in this role.

527~~~
Potentially huge vote of confidence if it's true Van Gaal changed his mind on Pedro and decided we don't need him because of what we already have. Would indicate he has faith in him and his performances so far even if he has been inconsistent. Definitely has the talent to succeed but he's still obviously a fair bit away from the finished product. Wouldn't be the first time Van Gaal rejected bigger names to give youngsters a chance though, and it'll definitely pay off in the future (if we don't go and sign somebody else of course). Just short term it'll probably mean we won't be winning too many trophies.

528~~~
I don't see how Januzaj has anything to do with Pedro, Adnan is playing centrally and isn't fast, Pedro was to add pace to our wide attack on the right.

529~~~
Because Mata is the first choice player on the right, and if Pedro came then Mata would go in the middle and januzaj to the bench. The way I see it... Rooney, Memphis and Mata are pretty clear starters as they are our best attacking players. Who is the other player, whether its a right winger or #10? It's up for grabs. Januzaj, Herrera, Fellaini and Pereira will all be fighting for that spot, even Hernandez (to push Rooney deeper and him to start up top). So us getting one more starting quality player would mean that those players are all firmly back up players for the starting positions, instead of having a spot to compete to make their own in the starting 11.

530~~~
The #10 role is up for grabs but I don't think LvG has any intention of using Mata there because he is so easily knocked off the ball, he's less risky playing from wide. He has played everyone but him there. Pedro would have upgraded Mata on the right and gave us pace either side of Rooney with Adnan developing as the #10.

531~~~
If we signed Pedro, we would have moved things around so Mata would stay. Mata has been excellent this season IMO and I'm always confused when I see people thinking Van Gaal will drop him eventually. He's exactly the type of player Van Gaal loves (minus the physical attributes). So smart on the ball, always gets 90%+ pass accuracy, has a huge impact in controlling games, picks out the right man very often, and can both score and create goals. He's not going to be dropped nor should he be, because he's a terrific player at his best, which I think he can be now that he has players with pace around him stretching teams more then before when he had nobody to aim at.

532~~~
played well last night.  looks to have matured a bit this year.  looking for the pass a bit more.  good to see.  Probably Memphis' addition has helped him a bit, always good for younger players to have peers their own age to spur them on

533~~~
Who are the players with pace he now has to aim at? Januzaj and Rooney are not fast, Memphis is the only addition we have made in this regard. I thought he'd be dropped because he's not fast enough out wide and offers zero penetration and is too weak to play centrally, he was the obvious player to upgrade in the front 4.

534~~~
I think LVG has done the right thing with little Adnan. He was getting the usual media hype bullshit up until LVG slapped him with a proverbial glove. Now he knows he has to graft like the rest of em to be in the team. Well the rest apart from Wayne 'untouchable' Rooney.

535~~~
Januzaj has decent pace, not blistering of course, but he has good movement and makes clever runs in behind which is the important thing. Rooney once he is at his best looks quicker and stronger and just better all around. I do think we need more pace in our attack, but it wouldn't be Mata dropping out that's for sure. He doesn't need to be fast for his role. He doesn't play as a proper winger but a wide playmaker like how Silva is for City essentially. I don't think he's as good or creative as Silva is, but at his best he's still a top class player and can have a similar impact.

536~~~
Januzaj has poor acceleration like Barbatov, that is why he struggles to get away from players, they catch him easily over the first few years, he's fine once motoring but you rarely get the chance to do that if you can't get off the mark quickly. There's no point in us going round and round on this mate, you clearly rate Mata in this role and I don't so we might as well just leave it at that, as for Rooney, he's physically deteriorated, he's not going to outpace defenses.

537~~~
^^^^^ This - I realize the Villa game was not exactly top notch, but for the first time in recent memory I could look up and see all 4 players up top in different spots.  Rooney would come deeper to get the ball, Adnan would shift to either side while Memphis and Mata would go central.  This is the third game these 4 have played together - it really can only improve.  Was it great football - NO - but it certainly gives a glimpse of what is to come.

538~~~
I thought he played well. I really really hope Van Gaal continues to stick with him. The last thing he needs is another stop-start season. All he needs is a good run of games.

539~~~
So ... fair bit of trust placed in him this year it seems. 
Nervous about how it'll work out but i can definitely get behind the idea, anyone who was around the summer we sold hughes, kanchelskis and ince should be.
Sink or swim time for a lot of players this year with the pedro deal off.

I think our defence and midfield are good enough to keep us in the top 4 at least but quite a bit being asked of the front 4 from last night.
How well they do as a combination will decide where in the top 4 we finish, with fellaini, young and hernandez being decent back up.

540~~~
I do not get how Mata or Herrera doesn't get a start at 10.  Januzaj is talented but he really doesn't do enough for the team.

541~~~
It was great to see all his touches in one video (thanks <a class="username" data-user="67446, @MoneyMay" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/67446/">@MoneyMay</a> ) and I have to agree. He's working extremely hard and he can control the ball artistically at times. I see him continuing to work on the deficiencies in his game and realizing his potential, it may just take a little longer than we want. His mentality is right, he has the talent.

542~~~
He can actually get past players rather well. Pace doesnt really seem to be an issue with him

543~~~
I really hope we keep playing him. 

Sure he might give the ball away more than Young, but he's also more unpredictable and once it all clicks and he fulfills his potential he'll be an absolute superstar.

544~~~
Major point that few seem to give appropriate consideration. The hattrick chance Memphis fluffed was an illustration of what could come but isn't quite there yet. With all our changes over the last few years, that means everyone has to re-learn their roles, develop new understandings and partnerships, and practice all over again. 

Adnan wasn't playing regularly like the rest and, with his age, he'll take even longer to hit his heights but it will come. A potentially big silver lining in all this transfer hoopla, imo

545~~~
I really think this lad is destined to be a star

546~~~
Odd post given that getting past players is exactly what he's best at, and he does it almost effortlessly.

547~~~
I didn't say getting past I said getting away, he uses a trick to get past them but can't get away as he has poor acceleration and they recover on him.

548~~~
He doesnt use fancy trickery to get away. Usually he just moves to the side quickly then uses his pace to get away. He certainly does not have poor acceleration as he showed during the Moyes season

549~~~
I hope LVG sticks with him, even if he has a couple of dodgy games. He won't learn anything sat on the bench and if he does fulfill his potential by playing regularly then we'll have an excellent player on our hands. He already looks stronger than last year, he's never going to be a Ronaldo in terms of physique, but he has filled out a bit, which is good.

550~~~
Never noticed that myself. Once he's past a man he tends to show him a clean pair of heels. He's not lightning but he's certainly fast enough to make his dribbling count.

551~~~
Not happy with Herrera on the bench at all but if there is any player who should steal some minutes from him it should be Adnan or Andreas. It's Januzaj's future role so the sooner we will start him playing there the better for him and it shall pay off.

I was pleased with what I've seen from him last game. I think Mata could alternate with Pereira on the other. Herrera with Adnan and one of the pivots..

552~~~
Hope he keeps his place for Newcastle.

553~~~
God bless their persistence but they might need to work on a more short-term strategy.

554~~~
Yep, needs to keep starting. If we want him to develop consistency, then he needs consistent game time.

I'd be interested to see us try him on the right, Memphis on the left and Herrera in the middle. Mata's been doing well but one game off won't do him any harm and it might be worth taking a look at that more dynamic trio.

555~~~
Mata's been great in the last two games. The more that him, Memphis and Januzaj work on their link-up play together the better.

If/when Hererra starts it should be instead of one of our central midfielders. Presumably when we next play a really poor team at home.

556~~~
Never get why people think Januzaj isn't quick? He prefers to use trickery and movement to get past players but when he's faced one on one, there's time where he just knocks it down the line and leaves the defenders for dead. He's definitely not slow, and has enough acceleration and top speed to get away from most defenders.

Around the box and in tight spaces, he obviously uses his great dribbling skills, trickery and close control to beat a man. He normally stands them up (similar to Nani) and drops a shoulder to go one way and then goes the other. If he gets a run of games this season, then I think he can flourish and finally start to show his ability. For me, he can develop into a terrific no.10, his passing while inconsistent at the moment is very good but he seems to be under pressure at the minute and trying too hard to make things happen. 

From a team perspective it would make sense to put him on the right for now and Mata as the no.10 or Herrera, Mata slows the game down too much out wide and is too weak and slow to be effective there while Januzaj does have all the attributes to be a great winger who can cut in and play dangerous balls or go on the outside and beat his man.

557~~~
Possibly - but then Januzaj doesn't get minutes in his preferred position and the one which he will surely play in the future. I'd prefer we just stick with him at #10 for a while. He's not going to learn how to play as a #10 if he's shunted out to the wing. We haven't done Phil Jones any favours with this sort of treatment in the past either.

558~~~
I reckon he'll start on Saturday and he should start. He can improve his play by playing constantly and I feel this could be his break out season.

559~~~
That sounds more like Valencia, Adnan has excellent footwork that allows him to shift the ball between feet and swerve the defender, but his poor acceleration means he rarely gets away with the ball.

It just feels like we are seeing different players, I don't see speed as a big asset at all with Januzaj, to me his control and passing will be what allows him to hurt teams centrally like Silva, but he's not going to go past players and burn them off like Hazard or Sanchez as more often than not most have the speed to recover if he doesn't release the ball quick enough. 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

560~~~
<a class="username" data-user="48107, @Devil may care" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48107/">@Devil may care</a> 

I think it's the other way round. He's got good acceleration which often allows him to get past players but hasn't quite got the pace (or strength) to keep it up.

561~~~
He doesn't have poor acceleration at all. In fact I'd say it's one of his strengths. His sprint speed isn't great, but he certainly has enough acceleration for it to be a valuable asset.

562~~~
Strength is an issue I agree, he sometimes can't protect the ball long enough to get a pass off, but he could negate that to a degree if he had good acceleration that gave him  couple of yards breathing room to make his decision.

563~~~
I wouldn't describe it as a big asset either, but nor would I consider it a weakness, and I don't remember ever thinking that it prevented him from escaping the attention of a man he'd beaten with his quick feet and tricks.

He certainly doesn't 'burn defenders off' like Sanchez; his pace isn't anywhere in that league. But I don't think Hazard does that either, because his pace, similarly, is decent rather than special. Hazard ensures he stays past defenders once he's beaten them through a dribbling style which really glues the ball to his feet, and his excellent balance and strength; he doesn't offer anyone else a glimpse of the ball, and certainly not a defender who is already behind him.

Januzaj, for his part, tends to escape cleanly because the <i>way</i> he beats defenders - with very pure trickery and unplayably fast feet - tends to <i>really</i> beat them. He'll put his man on the ground, or send him so decisively the wrong way that by the time he's got himself sorted out Januzaj is long gone. He only normally has to beat his man once.

564~~~
Again being linked with Borussia Dortmund in today's BILD.

565~~~
His off the ball running is excellent, one of the few players in this squad who moves around off the ball

566~~~
Hope he keeps his place this weekend. Would be great to see an academy player making it in the first team, and adnan undoubtedly has the talent.

567~~~
No chance in hell that is happening.

568~~~
I think that would be a good move albeit I'm not quite sure what Dortmund gets out of developing one of our players but if they are really interested in loaning him I would take that in a heartbeat unless LvG is really planning with playing him for the majority of games.

569~~~
It's a loan deal according to Bild not a full transfer. I think it would be a good deal for us unless we really can't bring in any attacker anymore which would leave us a bit short in attacking options if we would loan him out.

570~~~
Oh. I didn't know that. If we do loan him out, BVB would be an excellent option I think. Plus if that helps us getting a better shot at Reus, I am all for it. My only concern is the same as yours. If we don't bring in someone this window it would leave us short in numbers and quality.

571~~~
He'd find it hard to get games for dortmund on the evidence of their opening bundesliga game. Paticularly when you consider the fact that they have no interest on developing him,  unlike us.

572~~~
Keep playing him, please!

573~~~
Well that's a reasonable concern. If Reus, Mkhitaryan and Kagawa stay fit and in form it would be hard to break into this team. On the other hand he is the only left footed attacker in that lineup and maybe exactly what Tuchel is looking for. Oh yeah and Tuchel in contrast to Klopp actually likes to rotate his team so I guess he would get game time, the question is just how much.

I would also prefer if he gets to start a lot of games for us and can find his footing here again. He showed some promising stuff int he first couple of games and I think he now just needs the playing time and build up his confidence. I just hope that LvG sees in him a player that if nurtured correctly can help us even in the short run or else I'm afraid he will find himself on the bench again.

574~~~
I don't see how he'd get any more games at Dortmund than he would at United? If he's going to get sub appearances at Dortmund he's just as likely to get as many here, if not more as we are in more competitions.

575~~~
I can't see Dortmund agreeing to a loan deal without an option to buy him for good after a year. It doesn't make sense for them at all.

576~~~
If he's good enough for Dortmund then he's good enough to stay here.  Keep him and play him as much as possible, it's the only way he can develop consistency in his game.  My only gripe is I'd swap him and Mata around but Adnan's future probably lies centrally so maybe it's for the best to let him play there.  Less of this Chelsea and City shit of not giving our talented youngsters the chance to prove themselves.

577~~~
I think it depends. If we end up buying Mane and Griezmann before the window closes his game time might be cut short, if we don't sign anyone we can't loan him out as we will 100% need him.

Yeah like I said I'm not sure what Dortmund has to gain by developing one of our players, they aren't really the kind of team that should go for a loan deal so probably Bild is just talking out of their ass.

578~~~
Think he's started really well but i was just watching highlights from tuesday night and i didn't previously notice he turned his back on the free kick and deflected it. Should have blocked it really. 

Hope he starts today.

579~~~
If they want to give us Reus they can have him on loan, otherwise do one

580~~~
Not convinced by him in the #10 at all. Would prefer him out on the right with either Mata or Pereirra more centrally.

581~~~
His runs beyond the striker are neccessary

582~~~
Agreed. We need someone with pace and dribbling ability in that role to make up for Rooney's lack of it. Probably why we tried Depay there too.

583~~~
yup

584~~~
Pereira can run and his a better dribbler, but I agree Januzaj traits are helpful in that position.

585~~~
Agreed, he kind of looks like he isn't sure what he's supposed to be doing and doesn't sync well with Rooney at all.

586~~~
His runs in behind are just one attribute and don't make up for the amount if turnovers he's responsible for in that area. Also, runs in behind can and should also be done by wide players. Adnan would be just as capable doing that from wide positions, much like Memphis does.

587~~~
Agreed. His decision making is still far below the standard expected. Far too many dribbles to nowhere and possession donated to the opponent against all other reasonable actions. That said, he won us the game vs Villa too so there are caveats and improvements over last year's dire, dire efforts.

Still think he's better off switching with Mata. If he can't restrict those individuality expression brain fart moments, it's safer for the team wider than central.

588~~~
Yeh he's a brilliant and exciting talent. Really enjoy watching him play, just don't think he's suited to the 10. Especially in games where the space is really tight.

I've seen posters really focus on this "run beyond the striker" argument. I agree it's a useful trait but the focus on that particular trait is way too large. Only seems to have started since it was mentioned by a pundit too...

David Silva is probably the best #10 in the league and he's not constantly sprinting past his striker. The position is about much more than that.

589~~~
If we had a proper striker making proper runs it wouldn't be such a big point. However since Rooney is not doing what he should be, we need someone in there who will. Mata wont do it either. Or we bite the bullet and play Hernandez up top.

Januzaj makes mistakes, but I like the fact he has a free role, he pops up on the right, left and through the middle. Very difficult for the defenders to pick up.

Issue with his atm is he dwells on the ball for too long, but he does create and he will score when played centrally, needs to be more careful with the ball, but he'll get there

590~~~
Sounds like a fair deal to me. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

591~~~
He's playing as a hold up striker, he's not going to <i>make runs</i> because that isn't his role.

592~~~
That's nonsense to be fair. Yes, he's playing with his back to goal but to suggest he can't make runs as well is a bit silly. Especially when we dominate the ball in the areas we do.

It's a balancing act and at the moment he's not even nearly getting it right. I'd question whether he's capable of it at all.

593~~~
Thats a nonsense. He needs to make runs, especially with Carrick/Bastian/Mata on the field

594~~~
I'm no saying he can't make runs, I'm saying he's not going to do that. From the start of the season that has been pretty obvious that it isn't his directive. When he holds up play and the 10 runs through is when players start to look for the ball in behind. The problem is that both Adnan and Memphis kind of struggled to read those situations properly. When Adnan did it resulted in a goal.

Basically we have inverted wingers, there is little to no point in making runs in behind looking for passes over the top unless the line is high. But if the line is high then the wingers are pushed up and creating anyway. It is a catch 22, he's not going to look to endlessly make runs in behind because it is a low percentage pass that nobody is going to try in the first place. It is wasted energy. 

Bastian has played one single ball to him in the first two league games. That to me says it is pretty obvious that is not our directive for the striker.

595~~~
Of course it's part of his job too. There are many things requires from a striker.

596~~~
Anyway this is not really the thread to discuss this.

597~~~
I'm sorry but I really don't agree. I'm not talking about being in the shoulder and balls being played to him over the top, that's not his game. I'm taking about when we're in the final third, dominating the ball, and he's just stood there, waiting for the ball to feet so he can do his usual pass back to the player who passed it to him or spray it out wide.

He should be peeling away and making runs in those situations. Even if you don't get the ball you occupy defenders and make space for others. It's a basic requirement for any striker.

598~~~
Feel free to provide some examples in one of the Rooney threads. I'd like to see what you are talking about, as I was mainly talking about playing on the shoulder, you are correct.

599~~~
Not sure where this idea comes from.

600~~~
Considering how deep Mata has been playing, also how direct Depay has been. It kind of takes the context of how out of position the two players playing at 10 have been and how out of sync they have been with Rooney out of the equation. I still think Adnan needs a <i>just get him in space and get him going at players</i> role to spark him. Not sure if 10 is the right position for that.

601~~~
I think he will score today if he's given a start

602~~~
He's getting a decent run of games which is good to see.

603~~~
Great to see him starting again, hopefully he does well!

604~~~
Pleasing to see Van Gaal have faith in Januzaj and is willing to give him a run of games.

605~~~
Sarcasm, right?

606~~~
Nope,

why do you think only wide players should do runs in behind ?

607~~~
He said also not only.

608~~~
Jari Litmanen was not a #10 in the mould of Silva and nor is Thomas Muller but they are two of the best exponents of LVGs system. As much goalscorer as creator and playing closer to the position of a second/shadow striker than that of the classic #10. Lets not forget that this is the man who saw no use for Riquelme in his philosophy.

I think it was LVG himself that said he likes his third midfielder (although why he refers to the position as midfield is beyond me) running beyond the striker when he was talking up Memphis for the role in preseason. I imagine Silva would be put on the wing if he was at our disposal as he doesn't offer the goal threat that LVG seems to crave from this role.

Janujaz has been a bit sloppy in the past two games but he is young and has not enjoyed a solid run in the team since Moyes (through his own poor form I admit). I liked what I saw in terms of movement, energy and tempo and so am willing to offer him a little patience to see how he grows in to the role. The fact that he is comfortable interchanging with both Memphis and Mata makes the potential combo quite promising as well.

609~~~
...

610~~~
Riquelme was the very definition of a luxury player tbf but you're correct. I understand why Adnan is being played in the #10, I'm just expressing that I'm not convinced it's a role that gets the best out of him.

Having said that I shouldn't complain too loudly, Adnan is a massive step up in that role compared to Fellaini.

611~~~
LVG seems to have a lot of faith in him. Fantastic to see.

612~~~
Great stuff. I'm glad LVG sees the upside to giving him chances. In terms of natural talent he's right  up there.

613~~~
tbf to Adnan, who was the last player who was great at no10 role for us? We have so many players who can play there but it's just difficult position to master and for such a young lad even more so. He has no speed to be exactly future winger but playing there certainly helped him build his confidence, anyway maybe it's good we should start giving him games as no10 as it's his future best position if we look at the start position of the player.

I think he would come best as a free roaming attacking player but wasn't it what he showed only recently? He made some good runs which indicate that he likes to play as a nonconventional no10 interchanging positions with the front four. I hope he starts showing more composure and will not lose ball so easily but once he bulks and wise up he can be beasty player, he already has a great flair but tends not to show it so often as the rest of our formation is a little bit too strict positionaly, good signs lately though, and as a player in Van Gaal systems he is supposed to build confidence through the whole game with passing around. 

So I hope he gets few good touches early in the game and we will see some take-ons and some through balls from him which I am missing from him recently

614~~~
Fecking stoked to see Adnan play again. He's clearly a developing player who's chasing form after last years debacle but I thought he showed very promising signs last game and our attack just screams out for some flair and dribbling when we have Mata out wide. Mata has done his defensive job so good that it makes sense to play Januzaj centrally and I've always thought it will be his long term position anyhow. 

As a winger he lacks the pace and dribbling to be world class but as a number 10 his dribbling is top notch and only Firmino and Sterling betters him in it and I'd say he's quite close to them in that regard even. His all-round game is already very good but he needs to learn the importance of composure in that number 10 role, sometimes dropping back towards the central midfield and just offering a one touch option for them is vital too. Especially against the bigger sides who exclusively plays midfield threes which makes it hard for our two midfielders if there is no easy passing routes.

615~~~
Exactly. He was making overlapping runs out wide which is essential if we want to allow Mata/Depay so much freedom to cut inside and he looked pretty good overall. Had some nice moments beating his man and just some minutes in to last game he should have had an assist on that cross to Rooney. 

I don't think he needs to bulk up, the problem is that Januzaj still hasn't learnt to judge when the opponent is pressing too well - in which case he should just pass it back to Schweinsteiger and then trust him and the team to use the space that was created from dragging that defender out of position. He's trying too hard to control every ball and turn his opponent. 

He just made 16 passes in 60 minutes against Villa and he had 28 touches.

616~~~
His decision making at key moments is horrendous.

617~~~
Certainly can be.

It's becoming really frustrating that the opposition are seemingly allowed to kick him all over the pitch without the ref being the slightest bit bothered. Happened against Villa too.

618~~~
Was great imo, should easily have 2 assists. One stolen by the linesman, other by Depay.

619~~~
He's actually deceptively quick. Granted he's not blistering but certainly quick enough.

620~~~
Good half, still needs to be stronger, but this lad is gonna be some player

621~~~
One moment he provides a wonderful through ball to Memphis. The next 3 times he dwells on the ball and turns possession over either directly or indirectly with a stitch pass and kills attacks.

Please switch with Mata.

622~~~
Not as bad as Memphis

623~~~
I thought he had a decent half, there were times he got the ball, looked up and the movement ahead was poor so he had to play it square, I didn't feel he made poor decisions.

624~~~
Rooney needs to stay in the fecking middle

625~~~
He's played relatively well there in these three games. Lost the ball easily too often but picked up good positions, played some nice passes and carried the ball very well. It's been three promising performances rather than three good performances, but he's done enough to warrant a run there. Including getting the assist for Rooney's ruled out goal today.

626~~~
Yeah, the game adds more fuel to the Rooney as a #9 or #10, he drifts away from the CB's too often.

627~~~
Thought he was one of our better players in attack. Will only grow into his position with more games.

628~~~
He has been fine.

629~~~
His best game so far.

630~~~
He's been good, what are you talking about?

631~~~
Not being knocked off as easily. It's ludicrous how much starting games can improve a young player

632~~~
he looks fine, been overlooked at times with his runs off the ball after which he lacks a bit of stamina himself, the transition between midfield and front four has come to shit after Sweinsteigger picked a little injury and was running it off for the rest of the half..

633~~~
Are these refs going to offer him some protection or what? Anita all but trying to bum him

634~~~
Until he stops diving probably not.

635~~~
Seems to still work for Eden Hazard

636~~~
Awful dive that

637~~~
I think the dive and the score is going to influence a lot of the caf posters about his performance. He did well and should have had an assist.

638~~~
Should have had 2

639~~~
Again bullied off the ball. Dived as well. Disappointing again.

640~~~
He was piss poor.

641~~~
I keep trying to understand why he gets to play so much in that position and I still don't get it.

642~~~
I know. Average shielding of the ball, diver, no pace, no real shooting threat.

643~~~
Cheat.

644~~~
He needs to cut that diving shit out.

645~~~
He was decent in the first half, then faded. It has got to the point where I refuse to judge our attacking players until we get a new striker in.. having Rooney up top would make Messi as a 10 look shite.

646~~~
Really should send him on loan, his decision making is really poor. Plus, he's so weak.

647~~~
Think a lot of people are being harsh on him today. While not an amazing performance, it was a good performance for the most part. First half he was involved plenty and a part of why we were dominating at the beginning.

648~~~
Some of the posts in here....wow. Was always going to get the hook for Hernandez but he'll only improve with game time.

649~~~
I don't think he adds enough as a #10. He was alright in the first half but again he gets shoved around far too much, might be better to see him on the wing some time.

And he needs to cut out his diving antics already, fecking embarrassing.

650~~~
Not a fan of his. I don't see the potential that so many others see.

651~~~
What an overreaction from some here. Put Rooney through which should have stood, put Depay through, he had his moments today.

652~~~
It's the dive and the score. People are being incredibly harsh. Either that, or they didn't pay attention enough. It's fine if people want Herrera as a starter, but some comments are ridiculous.

653~~~
The game just passed him by again. Apart from that Villa goal he's been very underwhelming.

654~~~
Not strong enough and decision making too slow. He isn't ready to be a starter for us.

655~~~
We certainly need to sign a direct, fast, experienced attacking player (Pedro). Infact we probably need 2 as Memphis should be coming on as a sub this season and not starting.

Januzaj - loan him out.

656~~~
It is not overreacting , he just hasn`t been good . I am sure most people , myself included , would love to see him come good but so far he has looked poor and is massively overrated . LVG likes a naturally attack minded player as his number 10 but on todays showing Herrera couldn`t of done worse if he tried . Fellaini would have replaced him much earlier if he had been available in my opinion . Time will tell I suppose , hopefully he will come good . The dive was embarrassing , he needs to cut that out .

657~~~
I thought he was very good in the first half. Shame he had to drop deep to get the ball. But the touch, movement, and passing was impressive. Looked a bit like Juan Valeron, early on in his career

658~~~
He had his moments. But there's times he's just taking too many touches and not releasing it early. 

I don't think he should be a starter yet. But I rather keep him than loan him to shite like Sunderland.

659~~~
The fact he's copping so much abuse is bizarre to me given his age and the fact the movement ahead of him was so poor, not to mention that Memphis was equally ineffective overall.

660~~~
He doesn't look overrated at all. He looks like a massive talent who is unsurprisingly rough around the edges.

661~~~
I think we're struggling to make it happen for him. He's probably not an attacker, probably not an attacker in a front three either. To me he's a winger. Sometimes has his moments with dribbling and can take a shot. It's just his body is not strong enough or especially fitting to be a striker/forward. I'm willing to give him more time though because he's not crap.

662~~~
He should have two assists today.. Was pushed, kicked all game by Anita.. he was not bad at all..

663~~~
I agree he has got talent but still think he is overrated , he`s still got a lot to prove and I really hope he does but he was poor again today .

664~~~
Hit and miss but that's hardly surprising considering his age and development stage. 

Needs to stop diving though. That was pathetic today.

665~~~
Of course he's got a lot to prove. He's 20 years old ffs.

666~~~
Needs a dazzling performance in his current position to really announce himself. Or I fear he'll be repalced by Fellaini soon.

667~~~
I thought he played relatively well, he was probably our biggest threat for much of the time he was playing. His runs through the middle help us out a lot and make us dangerous, we just need to figure out how to finish our chances.

He's still very young so the inconsistency in his decision making will only get better. The dive was pathetic though.

668~~~
Obviously weak and lets it show. Can't see any premiership defenders being worried when they see him starting. I agree that Fellaini would be far more effective.

669~~~
He has got time on his side but LVG hasn`t and can see him going with Fellaini when available as even though he likes to give youth a chance he can`t afford to when he needs results .

670~~~
I thought he played well. Played a good ball through to Memphis who messed it up, he collected the ball in various areas of the pitch, I actually thought he protected the ball OK, a few times he should have won a free kick and he didn't lose it in any dangerous areas today.

I feel sorry for any #10 who gets criticised for not releasing the ball early enough when you've got absolutely no movement from your #9

671~~~
I can't believe what I am reading in this thread... Ridiculous.

It was his best game this season.

672~~~
Needs to cut out the diving, obviously. I don't think he should be playing in that behind the striker role either. At least not at this stage of his career. He needs to keep developing physically and learn to protect the ball better. Mata, Herrera, and Fellaini should be ahead of him in that current role.

673~~~
I liked what I saw from him today. Had a bit of cut and thrust about him that was missing in previous games.

674~~~
I don't think Fellaini should be the one to replace him. I think Fellaini should be the Plan B when we need a goal. If anyone is to replace Adnan it should be Herrera.

675~~~
His going to the ground easily is what annoyed me most about him more than anything. He also needs to improve his strength (which might go hand in hand with that).

676~~~
Can we really carry 2 inconsistent young but obviously talented players in the team? Once Fellaini is back i expect him to take his place.

677~~~
He needs to be stronger but I think he'll do well in this role.

678~~~
Good game today. You wonder what some of the people in this thread were watching!

He was fine, it does not help when your no. 9 keeps dropping deeper than you. That gave the defenders the freedom to close him down with no striker to cause them problems. 

I want to see what he can do with a proper striker, not one who seems to play everywhere except where he is supppsed to play.

680~~~
Its only due to circumstances which are completely out of his hands that this thread isn't housing a veritable wank fest at the moment.

681~~~
Not productive. Rooney and Hernandez a better option. A great talent though.

682~~~
Erratic so far this season but has also provided some of the much needed creativity to our side. I'd like to see him behind Hernandez as he'll have an easier time forming an understanding. The fact that Rooney is here, there and seemingly nowhere makes it hard to build anything other than 'off the cuff' moves.

Needs to up his consistency and stop going missing but he'll need a run of games to let him relax in to the side a bit more. He is always looking to penetrate the opposition lines, whether that be a pass or dribble, and I think that has been the key to the teams increased tempo through periods of the last two games. I actually prefer him in this floating role than stuck out on the wing. Much more to come but some good signs of what he can bring to the team.

683~~~
Didn't watch the game, but I did catch his disgusting dive. fecking hell, Adnan.

684~~~
That's far more unlikely than Herrera starting a game.

685~~~
Was against sending him out on loan, but thinking about it now, would send him to Dortmund on a loan (if they really want him). Would benefit him. Right now not potent enough for our needs.

686~~~
We have too few forward players as it is.

687~~~
What a clown.

688~~~
Thought that was pathetic, he spends more time on the floor than standing. Reminds me a lot of Nani, nothing winds me up more than players who keep protesting about getting "fouled", just get up and get on with it.

I think he's a talent and will be a good player for us, but for now I'd send him on loan, but to a premiership side.

689~~~
That is just awful. Cut that shit out ffs.

690~~~
Would you 'tolerate' a dive if it won your team a penalty?

691~~~
Can't say I wouldn't be happy about it, especially if it meant winning a game.

692~~~
The dive from him was fecking embarrassing.  Thought he and Memphis were decent in their buildup play, but once they got to the final third made some poor decisions.  Would like to see Herrera or even Pereira given opportunities ahead of Januzaj.

693~~~
Absolutely not. Your question implies you would.

694~~~
I think he's fully deserving of his place in the side at the moment. Offers something completely different to anything else we have. 

I honestly think the Memphis - Januzaj - Mata combination would be superb behind a form, genuine number 9.

695~~~
Meh, can't say I wouldn't be happy about the penalty. I'd rather win by skill than deceiving the ref but at the end of the day it's still about winning.

696~~~
I thought he was very decent at times and very poor at times but he was definitely a creator. The problem is he doesn't look sharp (yet?) and he's not become a threat himself (via goals, dribbling take ons, assists etc) so he's not had a positive impact enough on the game. For his future we should continue playing him and let him learn from it. 

Unfortunately I don't think that's gonna happen and we may not see him back for a long time the way LVG does thing. Remember Herrera starting the season and then go missing for several months?

697~~~
I find this forum really weird at times, everyone wants to see us bring youngsters through to the first team in theory but as soon as we actually do everyone gets on their back. I think he's been ok so far, a lot of good and a lot of bad. Pretty much what is to be expected, hopefully his run in the team continues.

698~~~
Too hesitant with his decision making and final ball, dive was utterly pathetic and needs a bollocking over that.

So far, showing better than last year,

699~~~
Played both Rooney and memphis in when they should have scored. Can't ask for more really.

700~~~
I agree that he offers something different but he has not been playing well really. Average at best, a few glimpses of quality but losing the ball far too often or picking out the wrong option. He has potential of course, but it's still far too soon for him to be a starter.

701~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTdNAvqocIc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Not great but was he really that bad...

702~~~
He has the skills but he dwells on the ball too much - won't be something that will improve w/o games. In that sense even Depay having played 2 full seasons in holland is ahead. He takes too long to decide what to do (he's not at the level of one-touch football yet) and so gets closed down quickly, sometimes double-teamed and ends up losing the ball or passing it back after much twisting & turning which can kill a whole move. He'll get better.  
<i>
I don't like his soft diving ways though - it's England and he's not going to get those calls especially when he earns a reputation for platforming so he needs to buck up! But .. we have to persevere as i think it'll click sooner than later (same with Depay).</i>

703~~~
Welcome to the caf.

704~~~
In my expert opinion, he's overthinking things at the moment. He was so static at times it was like he was too focused on where exactly he needed to be standing he was forgetting to to do everything else.

705~~~
He had a decent game, it will start coming together soon but I still think he has no clue where he's meant to be most of the time. That ball for Memphis was quite nice.

706~~~
Why would we send him on loan with the shortage of forwards we have right now? He was alright yesterday, stop looking for a scapegoat.

707~~~
i think he needs regular football.....Villa was his first start in 6 months or so I think and its going to take time

he took a lot of punishment yesterday as well I noticed with him being kicked a right few times....he reacted pretty well to this too

708~~~
I'm happy with him so far. Looking far more like the player who initially broke through than the one we saw last season. I prefer him in the middle as well as he's got the class for that role. I would prefer him playing a bit deeper though. Right now he's almost playing as a striker with Mata coming inside to playmake. Overall, good start to the season.

709~~~
He's so much better compared to last season where he resembled a headless chicken who would fall over the moment the wind blew.

710~~~
I thought he did pretty well yesterday. Didn't get in the box enough for a forward but on the ball he was probably our best attacker. He and Depay both dwell a split second too long at times but they'll get there for sure.

711~~~
Would look alot better if we started playing a higher tempo game with lots of passing and <span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>movement</b></span>.

712~~~
It really is pathetic and embarrassing. Absolutely cringeworthy reading threads like this after a disappointing result.

713~~~
I like that we are giving him chances but I wish it was on the right with Mata in the centre.

714~~~
I think it is unfair to expect him to create a understanding with rooney given that the latter's form has been woeful.

715~~~
I thought he did ok yesterday certainly was a lot better then Memphis and Rooney.

716~~~
How can anyone watch this and say he had a bad game? He had a very good one, and probably should have had 2 assists.

717~~~
No win really but the only way we are going to obviously improve him will be him playing at this level. He is clearly talented so patience and we'll see a world class champion IMO. Let's not do a Pogba

718~~~
Didnt do that well in the last two games. I think he should be dropped for the next game and be brought in as a sub, he shouldnt expect to start while performing like that. His decision making is so piss poor its really frustrating even if its understandable.

719~~~
I don't think he spends enough time in that typical #10 position, not enough of his touches where around the D on the outside of the box and he gets nowhere near the penalty spot/6 yard box when we're attacking either. He probably has a lot of freedom to go where he likes but when we're trying to break down a team with most of their players camped around the box he should be around the edge of the box himself.

720~~~
Hoddle said that he was making good runs off the ball.

721~~~
I thought I saw a few. I think his movement off the ball is actually quite good in general actually.

722~~~
I want to see his run in the side continue. If hes going to develop he needs to be playing consistently. Amongst the dour football this season, ive quite enjoyed watching Shaw, Depay amd Memphis being given important roles.

723~~~
The better highlight video
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6y_NJlgwEYU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Yeah, some of the people saying he had a bad game need to start paying more attention.

I'm sure that's the way he's always played as a 10, but LVG recently said he prefers his 10s to be more like second strikers than midfielders.

724~~~
Should be playing in Rooneys position IMO.

725~~~
Of course not, it was a decent to pretty good performance. If not for the incompetence of the linesman and the horrible touch from Memphis he should have had two assists. There was also the break he had with Mata and Rooney and the two of them made the two shittiest runs imaginable. Him being weak is massively overstated and he did well to hold off Colo and Anita on a number of occasions, he also doesn't lose the ball anywhere near as much as some like to believe. The best passing percentage on the team and according to the stats only dispossessed once.

He was also taken out late off the ball a few times by Anita and Colback who somehow weren't booked for any of them but of course the almighty anti-divers will come in force and bitch about him spending more time on the ground than on his feet.

726~~~
I think he won as many physical duels as he lost, so I wouldn't really say he was bullied. Certainly a big improvement on his last league game where he really struggled physically. His overall performance was decent and was nowhere near as bad as you make it seem, he was our best attacking player in the first half. Still has a long way to go obviously, but for someone who has played a handful of games as a #10 for the first team and is learning to play higher up the pitch, I think he's done well.

727~~~
He needs to start and finish a game for his own confidence. Don't really like the way van Gaal had him substituted for the past three games

728~~~
I'm pretty sure the subs were planned in advance due to him lacking match fitness for the full 90 minutes he came off around the 60 minute mark in all three games.

729~~~
Could easily have had two assists. A good performance. The dive was disgusting, I despise it. He doesn't get enough protection from refs but his diving is a big reason I feel why refs are hesitant to. He needs to cut that out of his game immediately, I loath it. Have I made that clear yet?

Nevertheless I hope he continues as its clear he's getting better every match.

730~~~
As far as the last game is concerned he wasn't bullied much in a proper way.It was just an incompetent performance from the ref.

Don't get people who want Fellani to be back to the XI.Do you enjoy hoofball that much?I don't.It's an effective Plan B, but we won't challenge for anything in the near future if that's gonna be Plan A.

731~~~
Turns out he was indeed quite good. Classy on the ball, and some nice bits of dribbling/passing. I'm not sure what people expect from a 20 year old.

732~~~
That could work.

Depay Januzaj Memphis
- - - - - ST - - - - - - - -

733~~~
Depay and Memphis have both been really good for us, I agree

734~~~
It could be if they gel, a long way to go, we were poor in the final third against Newcastle yet had plenty of chances, defensively we seem fine and in midfield too, I would imagine a lot of drills are being done for the final third in training so who knows when the attacking quartet develop their understanding.

735~~~
I'd prefer him to stay here. He'd end up in and out of the side at Everton, even if they don't sign either Bernard or Yarmolenko, as seems likely. He'd be up against players that are owned by Everton, who they have more interest in being successful and I think he could easily only play 25 games there. If we manage him right he should play that amount for us, particularly if we don't sign anyone else, as seems likely.

736~~~
Agree. And the sings against Newcastle were very good with regards to him and first team football here IMO.

737~~~
Haha whoops. Shaw, Memphis and Adnan, obviously!

738~~~
I think he played quite well, I don't think LVG is helping anyone with playing him as a second striker though.

He needs to play as a proper #10, linking the midfield to the attack.

739~~~
His final ball and decision making needs to improve and only way is playing him more.

740~~~
But, but, but LVG wants his #10 to be a second striker <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> Herrera is essentially the perfect man for the role you're talking about.

741~~~
Yeah he does. And I think its totally the wrong decision. The link between midfield and attack is non existent because of it. 

Personally I'd love Ander in that 3rd midfielder role.

742~~~
That's right Louis - send one of our options to play up front on loan - that will make Rooney REALLY undroppable <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

743~~~
As would I. I generally support LVG but he really is making some baffling decisions lately.

744~~~
Thought he was much much better yesterday and made allot of good passes. He looked like he took on board lvgs words about losing the ball and was far better at it yesterday. I say keep playing him in there for now give him 5 or 6 starts at least then him game time throughout the season.

745~~~
Would be interesting if he was kept in the XI for our next game as I believe he had never played 4 first team games in a row before.

746~~~
Rather he stays in the starting 11. Adds some risk/unpredictablility to our side.

747~~~
Did it happen already? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

748~~~
Theoretically, but Everton have not had this approach to loans previously, so I don't see why they will start now. Adnan would need to prove himself, but if he is good enough, he will play.

Martinez has recently enjoyed great success with Lukaku, Barry and Deloufeu on loan, and made all three integral parts of his team.

Anyway, I'd like Adnan to stay too. Some may be a bit frustrated, and perhaps more of his development process should be done out wide. That said, this temporary frustratio now will certainly be worth it soon, because he has the potential to bone of the best players in the country by th time he's 22.

749~~~
For what it's worth I don't think we would be foolish enough to do this as things stand at the moment. If we did this alongside not buying then Louie really is a dead man walking IMO.

750~~~
Still not sure if he's a striker though to be honest, more of a 10 than 9

751~~~
He's just said that he won't buy a striker unless he's the best striker in the world

.. but we already have Rooney so how can there be anyone better? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Adnan needs games but I doubt he'll get many with Fellaini back - doesn't disguise the fact that we need a top striker and it looks like we won't get one this season

So now the pressure is really on LVG to get us top 4 so we can attract players again next year and IMO it will be harder than last year

752~~~
Decent performances so far. No major howlers too.
But if he is left out, I would probably not bat an eyelid.

753~~~
I don't really get the point of playing Januzaj behind Rooney at home against a packed Newcastle defence, I'd much prefer to see Hernandez starting and play with two proper strikers.

754~~~
We need to give Januzaj a couple of games to get into the swing of things. He is talented enough, just needs the gametime.

755~~~
Hope he starts again against Brugge. If it wasn't for a dodgy offside call and Memphis' poor decision making (at the time he was through on goal) - we would have been celebrating a star performance at the weekend.

756~~~
Not sure what he's actually bringing to the team.

757~~~
It's great that he gets games but hell has he been weak when with the ball

758~~~
Not involved enough, and not doing much when he is

759~~~
He's been wank, so weak and ponderous on the ball.

760~~~
He needs to play consistently elsewhere.

761~~~
He dropped deeper and deeper as the half wore on.

Was even tracking runners into our box at few points.

762~~~
Doesn't seem to know his role in the team. Typically too close to Rooney, and not drifting into good positions at all. 

Pretty poor.

763~~~
Not sure how many remember this but Rooney was with his back to the defence and had a great chance to lay it for Adnan. He was in yards of space towards rooney's left. But he preferred to wait to link up with Memphis. Could have been a great chance for him.

764~~~
I like Adnan, and he's got the talent to make it here, but no matter what he thinks, he's not quite good enough to be our No.10. It's doubly frustrating to see Mata keep the ball effortlessly to no real impact on the right, while he loses it constantly in more dangerous areas.

765~~~
Probably second worse performance out there, after Herrera (who, tbf, grew into the game a bit better as the half went on). Our midfield is still way too open though and the gap between them and Januzaj is huge.

766~~~
Yeah, he's not good enough to be more than a bit-part player for us at this moment. We should loan him out to a team that can afford to give him the minutes he needs.

There's this myth that we have so many no. 10's but if this is what LVG sees as our strongest side right now, then Adnan is the player who would be easiest to upgrade on.

767~~~
4 games in a row he's been given now, he's just not justifying his place.. I'd play him out wide next time we play him, he is capable of beating a man at least, he's not doing it as a #10.

768~~~
He's not a number 10... I have no idea why LVG, or anyone for that matter, has ever thought that he is.

769~~~
Genuinely didn't even realise he was playing until late on in the half. Fellaini to replace him please.

770~~~
He's handing the spot to Fellaini emphatically.

771~~~
If Rooney comes back into full form Id be happier to stick with Januzaj, but while Rooney's only half firing I really dont think we can continue with Januzaj in the no. 10. It means the entire attack in central areas isn't functioning.

772~~~
You've got to be stronger than he is to play in the middle. He looks great at ten at U21 level, but the physicality has effected him.

773~~~
No idea why Van Gaal doesn't at least try swapping him and Mata around, it would benefit both players imo.

774~~~
I am a big fan, but he's been wank so far.

I think his problem is his lack of movement, he just stays and waits for the ball and obviously he always has some guy on his back.

775~~~
someone tell him to start lifting weights guys so weak a slight breeze could carry him away.

776~~~
Yup. If we sign another forward I'm almost certain he'll go out on loan. Still looks a little undercooked for constant gametime here.

777~~~
His touch is not good enough to play in the tightest areas on the pitch. A very, very ordinary half considering he's now had a run in this position.

778~~~
This is just one problem. 

He does not really make things happen. I mean, I didn't know what exactly he did in the first half or against New Castle for that matter. He should wake up or LVG may move on!

779~~~
He looked a lot stronger in pre-season, what's happened? Or does he just need to bulk up a bit more?

780~~~
good first three minutes releasing Shaw and Rooney, then average and hiding, he's not dynamic player, needs to be or little stronger, can't really be pushed off the ball like that

781~~~
Off now but was poor

782~~~
Apparently he played numerous games for the youth team there.... "Apparently" either way he needs replacing in the XI. We need an upgrade.

783~~~
He'll never live up to the hype imo

784~~~
Should watch Herrera and his movement. 

Januzaj just stands still.

785~~~
He'll struggle to get in ahead of Herrera in the number 10 role on the basis of tonight, but he'll still play regularly I think, even if it's more often on the wings as a sub.

786~~~
Classic redcafe. He was sub-par tonight, but he's a very young player who hasn't had regular game-time since his first professional season, which was 2 years ago with Moyes. Not to mention he's in a new position, in a system that (at first sight) doesn't seem to suit him. He excels with freedom and a license to play with risk. 

We should judge him at the end of the season. He definitely can't be accused of not trying, to be fair to him - he was tracking a few runners and tried to make things happen around the box, it's just that he is going through a spell where nothing is coming off for him.

I'd like to see him go on loan, but we may need him in case of an injury to Mata/Depay/Young, and he'll have plenty of times to impress in the cup games. No doubt he has to step it up, though. He's definitely capable of more than this.

787~~~
He needs more games but not sure he will get them for a while now. Let's see what LVG does but so far he has not shown enough

788~~~
A bit gutted for him. He seemed lifeless today... Didnt do a lot wrong, but offered very little going forward.

Just a shame that he didnt an assist or two against Newcastle as he deserved it, but now with this showing I cant see him playing for some time.

One thing Ive noticed about Adnan is his movement / lack thereof. Perhaps this is true of every player, but Adnan's best matches have been where he's moving all the time and looking lively. In his first year he was jumping around and moving like a mad man at every chance. It hasnt really been the case since then... Not sure why not?

789~~~
In what was is this "classic redcafe"? By saying he was poor (he was) or by saying he's not a number 10 (he's not)... either way, I don't see how anyone has been overly harsh on the bloke or anything.

790~~~
In a way, I think this thread is classic Caf. On the one hand, you've those people who just overhype Adnan to a huge degree. Can't understand how he isn't always the number 10 etc, nearly wet themselves when he's in the lineup.

On the other, you've the people who are only too delighted to come in here and bash him the minute he makes a mistake.

For my own part, I don't think he's been very good this year. I think he is a decent player, with a chance to be quite good. I don't see him becoming world class (hope I'm wrong) and don't think he's ready to be a regular just yet, and definitely not at the number 10 position. He has done a few decent things this year for sure, but overall, not enough for me. Would rather him out of the side for a few games now.

He was terrible tonight.

791~~~
You're bound to get games like this from young players.

Hope we stick with him, he's not going to get better sitting on the bench.

792~~~
I just don't like him as a #10, even though he did play a lot there for the reserves. Would rather see him on the wing.

793~~~
I thought he was wank today, and I also agree that he isn't a 10 at this moment in time. I don't disagree with that. I'm referring to the people who are making definite statements about whether he will ever end up as a 10 or not, as well as one of the comments above me, claiming he will never live up to the hype. He's obviously better on the wing, but that was just one season. Let's not forget how good he was, centrally, in the youth set-up - perhaps when he isn't as light as a feather, he will be able to adapt. Maybe not. I just think people are overreacting, as bad as he was.

He was worse than he is now while on the wing, last season, when people were crying for him to be tried as a 10 or a 9. Short memories.

794~~~
No stop, didn't you read his post: we can't judge him until the end of the season. So we should leave all player performance threads locked until then as discussing players during the season, based on their y'know actual real-time performances, is just "classic RedCafe". God, I hate posts like his, such self-indulged, better-fan-than-you, crap.

Fwiw, Januzaj hasn't justified his inclusion this season thus far. Herrera offered far more in that role once Januzaj came off. I like him a lot and he's shown some nice touches and his goal against Villa was well taken. But he's been very underwhelming and generally slowed play down and picked the wrong option when in possession. I'm all for giving him minutes and I hope he will really develop under LvG, but right now, he really shouldn't be a starter.

795~~~
We should really send him loan to Everton, could be very beneficial to us.

796~~~
He's just not suited playing so high up. He may have bulked up somewhat but not enough to play with his back to goal so much. Starting from wide or from a bit deeper in midfield would make a big difference for me.

797~~~
He just isn't ready yet, we should use him as an impact sub (but not as a #10).

798~~~
Worst game of the season so far from him. A bit anonymous and didn't bring the energy and tempo I felt he brought to the previous few games (the first halfs in particular).

Herrera moved in and pretty much bettered him in every department so in theory should have taken his starting spot. Maybe coming on as a sub for a while might help him impact the game a bit better whilst he continues to mature.

799~~~
Not a fair comparison with Herrera tbf. Herrera had a far more open game when he pushed into number 10 and after the 2nd goal Brugge almost gave up.

Herrera was also wank in the first half and Schweinsteiger behind him helped him more as a 10 too with control than he did with Januza.

800~~~
I didn't think he did anything wrong he just didn't do anything much at all, practically anonymous half.

801~~~
Can't say he didn't have his chances to make an impact... Playing in the hole, his favoured position, and just hasn't done much at all. You can see he's talented, he's just not ready to be starting. Gets pushed around way too easily and it's too easy to just make him invisible basically. Should be rotated in of course to get the playing time, but not first choice by any means.

802~~~
He should be more aware of his marker.Sometimes it's not like he's bullied but after he gets the ball he just turns into exactly where his marker is running to.

Anonymous half basically.That happens.

803~~~
Van Gaal said in the post match interview on Dutch tv that Januzaj had an issue with his hamstring if I heard correctly. That's why he took him off and played Herrera there. I think game time is most important for Januzaj so a loan would be best. maybe getting him somewhere he'll be scrutinised less will help him more as a player instead of playing in the team we have now where we might not have the patience to watch him grow.

804~~~
The talent is there and he is just 20, so a bit of patience is important. Think LVG might be better suited to slowly easing him into the team and making him earn his place. As it stands we don't have much cover for the flanks apart from Young and I'm sure he will get plenty of chances throughout the season, as he can play in any of the three spots behind the lone striker (to varying degrees). So there is no need to send him on loan, as we will surely need him for this season. 

It will be up to him to win the spot on the team, of course. LVG just needs to build up his confidence and manage his game time instead of forcing the starts, as weird as it may sound (seeing he is a youth prospect who needs game time) but it has to be based on merit. Still, I won't mind it if LVG puts his faith in him and believes he will come good in a while.

805~~~
LVG has given him plenty of chances now, there's nothing more LVG can do.

However, Id be curious to hear what this hamstring injury was all about. Might explain why he was so anonymous today.

806~~~
The talent is there but he's just not performing well. and there's only so much we can keep trying him.
I'd still rather he swapped positions with Mata properly even though they do tend to swap during the game anyways

807~~~
All true but we can only judge the players on what we saw and at no point in Januzajs four appearances this season (Brugge were pretty open in the first leg) has he looked as good as Herrera did for those 20 minutes or so. A very limited scope for comparison but that is all we have to work with at the moment.

I have praised Adnan for his previous performances, even if there were a few issues and general sloppiness, and genuinely do see an upside to playing him and letting him adapt to the role but if Herrera can replicate tonight's showing (second half) then I think it would be hard to justify omitting him in favour of Januzaj.

808~~~
Don't think you will see much more of Januzaj, he was awful tonight, think he is a great talent with potential but you have to make it count, and I am all for promoting the youths but he has been poor, the difference when he went off was incredible.

809~~~
Always preferred him out wide takin on full backs. Not at #10. Nothing to do with today's performance. Just my general view of him and where he can play properly

810~~~
Done well against Villa, but since then, he's not really progressed from that performance. Don't think he's a 10 at all. If we're going to play him, it should be on the right wing, in my opinion, where he can cut onto his left. Think when he's down the middle, he loses it too much and is not involved in the game enough. Don't think he should start against Swansea. Our 10's should be Herrera and Fellaini, in my opinion.

811~~~
I know he was hitting gym,had personal trainer too during break i think but he needs more,get more speed,more strength,dont doubt in his footballing skills.Hope he will be an ace for us in the future.

812~~~
I think he should be loaned. He's been given a chance and hasn't really impressed. With Herrera doing well in the role after him I would think that both Ander and Fellaini might be ahead of him in the pecking order now.

813~~~
May be a loan would be the best option for him. Hasn't taken his chance fully well.

814~~~

815~~~
he shouldn't be loaned. We lack forward players as it is. Loaning one of them would be pure madness.

816~~~
I think we should loan him too. Play Herrera instead and if we have..............., there are options. Loan him to Everton.

817~~~
Sure he wasn't particulary good till now but why loan him. If that happen than what, lets try Pereira so if he's crap too lets loan him.

818~~~
We shouldn't loan him i believe he has immense potential and he's going to be a great player for us, but i agree he needs to have more strength, CPl is traditionally far more a tactical contest than a physical one and the way he was man handled yesterday and coupled with his 2 previous outings in the league, i believe every attack is going to break down , i bet if he starts on sunday against Swansea Shelvey will disrupt him with challenges and physicality and it will be difficult for him. I hope Herrera starts in place of him on Sunday.

819~~~
Chris Eagles looked good for us in 2007 pre-season.

He's just not good enough to be our No. 10 at the moment. No movement, no vision, no confidence.

820~~~
No, I meant physical strength. He looked buff in preseason and strong physically on the ball.

821~~~
So did Fletcher last season in preseason.

822~~~
Just needs to get stronger that's all.

823~~~
I actually want him dropping deeper and floating around wide more when we have possession so he can more carry the ball and also attempt more forward passes.

LVG seems to like his #10 to be a support striker in possession pretty much. Though when we lose posession Januzaj was dropping fairly deep yesterday.

824~~~
Not up for loaning, only takes a couple of injuries or players to drop their level of performance and we'll need him again.

He's had a good run of starts and plenty of minutes under his belt, for a 20 year old playing at #10 for United he's done OK, some signs of what he has in his locker and natural ability and then large spells where he goes missing. Nothing to get drastically excited or disappointed about.

I think we'll see him on the bench for a spell now, still getting some good minutes as a sub and then expect him to start the earlier rounds of the cups and maybe any dead-rubber CL games providing how tough a group we end up in, so come the end of the season he'll have played a lot of football in our first team for someone at his stage of development.

You can see the quality is there, we just need to be patient and where possible give him the time to develop without it affecting the rest of the team.

825~~~
Couldn't be further from the truth. He has very good movement and excellent vision. At his age having a tangible impact on a game and stating involved throughout can be difficult.

I'd just like to see him up his intensity. Seems to play at too low a pace overall. He does something's that make his natural talent blatantly obvious but with time he will hopefully improve his overall involvement.

826~~~
Just not sure what he actually brings to the table in the #10 position. His first touch isn't good enough, He is very weak and too wasteful in possession. Putting him back wide and swapping him with Mata would make the most logical sense, but it's Van Gaal after all so I don't expect that to happen for another 12 weeks or so.

Not going to lie though, if I was Pereira I would be a bit hacked that Januzaj is getting these chances and not making the best of them while he can't even make the bench.

827~~~
Agree with this needs to add a bit more aggression to his game, give him some time to grow physically too. Don't think he's ready to be our first choice 10 though right now.

828~~~
He'll come good. I'm sure of it. Just needs to bulk up a bit.

829~~~
I think he's fine as second choice across all the attacking positions but yeah not quite title winning team first 11 player. I just disagree that he's got "no vision, no movement".

830~~~
I disagree. Beating people is not where his strengths lie. It's only one part of his game. Last year he played the wide role. He's doing better in the 10 role.

His touch is very good. Not sure what you're talking about. I do agree that he needs to get better at shaking defenders off him with strength or hiding the ball with his feet. Also Pereira isn't a 10. He's played there for the youth team and didn't do well. Januzaj is a lot more threatening in the 10 role than Pereira who apart from getting a shot off isn't much of a threatening passer in that role. He thrives with a little more space and without the need to be a consistent threat.

I agree with the others that Adnan needs to be a little more aggressive.

831~~~
I don't get the bulking up thing. If anything maybe he needs to get leaner now. He's probably not match fit but he does seem to lack that first step. 

He can definitely make it up with more intensity and aggression though. It'll help if he's get a bit more greedy and realises for all the great passes and touches, sometimes he needs to a be threat himself before defenders respect that and then invariably space will open up elsewhere (for a through ball, team mates making runs etc).

We absolutely need to continue playing him, whether through subs or as a starter.

832~~~
Bulking up won't improve his football IQ unfortunately. He needs to sort out the psychology side of things.

833~~~
I was ready to write him off (was just underwhelming whenever I'd seen him play), but I think he's improved a lot. Still has a long way to go.

834~~~
The next time Mata isn't on the right (so most likely dropped, as LVG doesn't like him centrally), i'd like to see him given time on the right. His ability to go past people is wasted as a 10 because he doesn't have the strength to do it in limited space. We saw in the Moyes season that he likes to run at players instead of having his back to goal, and I think we waste that part of his game when he is in the middle.

That having been said, I am still unsure of where he will be better long term - he certainly has the creativity to play centrally, and excelled there before he broke into the first team (as a false 9, in fact). Hopefully LVG keeps his faith in him and continues to give him games - people are criticising him heavily here, but he's playing regular football for the first time since 13/14 in a new position in a team with a new system. Give him time.

835~~~

836~~~
Called up for the Belgium squad, but I'm not sure if he can make it if he's injured.

837~~~
Might just be a small knock, but it would be good if he stayed at home and rested.

838~~~
He looks like he's struggling to perform all his duties in the system and remain creative. He might be the sort of player, like Di Maria, who can't thrive under LVG.

However, I like to think he'lol figure it out and then be able to apply discipline and creativity to devastating effect.

839~~~
Think he is doing ok, much better start than last season. Hope he stays and doesn't got on loan now. Not sure what all the hyper critics are going on about.

840~~~
I was certainly hoping he would be scoring regularly by now, after his debut season.

But after last season, I'm happy with his progress so far this term.

Makes me think of Zaha, for all his speed didn't have the timing, the understanding of movement and balance to get away from his defender like Memphis can. And just like Giggs could still leave defenders on their butts at 38 with a twist of his hips, Adnan is plenty speedy to create space, he just needs the timing. 

No small thing, of course.

841~~~
He'll be fine as he gets used to the position and his teammates' movement around him. Still think he's bit rusty, and he's extremely young.

842~~~
Any idea how serious his injury is? Might explain why he was so poor last game.

843~~~

844~~~
I could understand it if a)we had cover and b)he wasn't getting a look in with us.

Given he's finally broken into the team it seems very strange timing.

845~~~
I don't get it... Joint top scorer (lol) getting games finally we need as many dangerous players as possible and were going to let him go. If we don't have multiple incomings we are insane.

846~~~
If he and Hernandez leave then would there be more than Martial coming in? We would be looking a bit thin.

847~~~
Please get him away from here so he can finally be allowed to Express himself Again. A year at Dortmund would probably do him alot of good.

848~~~
I actually wondered when this would come up here as a few german (not too trustworthy tho) papers / media has already been speculating about that in the past week.
Surely if it's just a loan it's including a buy-out option otherwise I see no way Dortmund would agree to that. If that's the case (loan + buy-out option) it would be a good deal for BVB but it would actually be disastrous for United to give him away like that, especially with the attack looking so thin right now.
I could see Januzaj having success with Dortmund so it would make sense from the players perspective but yeah like I said, if United doesn't suddenly pull of three brilliant attacker signing you have to question Van Gaal and Woodwards sanity.

849~~~
Do not understand, why?
Rooney needs to go out on loan not Januzaj

850~~~
We might just reject the proposed deal and suddenly the meltdown looks ridiculous.Only few hours left before the German transfer window closed, not much time for them.

851~~~
caisenma in absolute ruins over latest januzaj departure rumours.

852~~~
Can we use this thread for his Dortmund adventures?

853~~~
Gutted I really like Adnan I think he's possibly played his last game in a united shirt

854~~~
Hope he can get in the team and improve at Dortmund. He should be a better player than Kagawa, based on their performances here.

855~~~
based on what did and is happening at Dortmund with the Japanese coming back to his real level, Kagawa surely is better and will be a starter

856~~~
Hope he gets more playing time at Dortmund.

857~~~
Is there a option to buy clause?

858~~~
He started four of five possible matches for us. It's really weird. lvg Even brought him to a presser two weeks ago.

I do t understand any of this.

859~~~
There is no option to buy and seemingly no loan fee either.

860~~~
No loan fee is strange but I'm glad there's no buy option.

861~~~
This is what has confused me the most, we don't even have any injury problems in that area, yet has started Adnan often so thinking he would get no game time doesn't really make sense. It isn't like he must of just realised Rooney and Herrera might be better options there and that we will definately get a striker signed before the deadline closes. Unless this turns out to be some sort of sweetner for signing Reus/Aubemeyang out of nowhere i truely won't understand it.

862~~~
I think he need to be fine turned,hope the Dortmund loan period would help him a lot.It helps all parties involved.

863~~~
According to the MEN it's deinitely just a loan and that they expect him to be at Old Trafford next year. Still strange, especially how few players we have up front.

867~~~
Only a friendly.

868~~~
Very impressive video though. I will gladly watch Dortmund this year now.

869~~~
Looks like he had a cracking debut. If we're even considering letting them go then it says to me that we're not being run properly. I'm no professional scout or football manager, but it is fecking blatantly obvious that he is an outstanding talent. If we do let him go then it is 100% a massive cock up on our part.

870~~~
Seems he's already doing what we want - playing a lot and playing well. Exactly what the loan is intended for.

871~~~
It was a friendly with every first choice attacking option missing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Two thirds of the players featuring yesterday will have nothing to do with the squad this season, mostly because it was a bunch of 16 and 17 year olds. For them it was way more of an opportunity than for Adnan, who will probably start his first offical game for us in about a week vs. Krasnodar with his debut being likely on Saturday vs. Hanover.

He certainly showed glimpses of why we wanted him, but also what he will have to work on. I´m sure he will contribute offensively, especially with his strengths in 1v1, but defensively he will have to integrate himself in our pressing system pretty quickly to be an option for the starting lineup. Oh and his tendency of not going after the ball after losing it is something he has to lose very quickly, unless he wants to feel the wrath of our coach.

872~~~
Anyone know if Januzaj and Kagawa were close during their time at United together?  Must be nice to have a friendly/familiar face while moving to a new league/country.

873~~~
It would, but a large part of these loans is for these boys to go away and come back men. United over-pamper young players, as do every top club really. If Adnan doesn't know anybody, he wouldn't be the first player, or young professional of any kind to have to make new friends and build relationships.

It will be good for him, if he's strong enough.

I'm sure the lad knows how to make friends. I know he speaks French and Dutch but I'm assuming now he also knows German?

877~~~
Social integration should not pose a problem with us. We have the reputation of being generally a very welcoming and friendly team towards new comers. Aubameyang and Mkhitaryan are both fluent in French and especially the former is known for making a real effort of showing the youngsters the ropes. On the training pictures from today you also see them together in pretty much every scene of Adnan with Auba showing and signaling for him a lot. Would not surprise me to read a story of Auba showing him the town in his black-yellow Lamborghini soon <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

Tuchel also speaks nearly perfect English and French  so no worries from that side aswell.

Heh, like Sokratis and Auba (who speaks surprisingly many languages...)? They even tried to integrate the little whiney bitch into the team, but they probably ate too soon. But, hey, even that problem is solved as the whole team and staff now eat together every time now.

Ciro Immobile aka our worst signing since the beginning of time...

883~~~
What was wrong with him off the pitch? I know on the pitch things didn't go too well.

884~~~
Publically complained about a lack of warmth in the team and by the Germans in general, which is kinda hilarious when you watch the interactions of the rest of the team and the overwhelming praise they and ex players have for the family like atmosphere in the club. But nobody wanted to invite him to dinners for example, so everything sucked for him <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>. Like I said whiny bitch, who especially at the end of the season completely isolated himself from the rest.

I always found it funny that a forward who has to be clinical is named Immobile <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/><img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

886~~~
Here's Moneymay's compilation of Januzaj's debut. It's better quality compared to the previous videos. You can see how much easier it will be for Adnan to impact the game with the movement Dortmund have and the freedom he has to go around the pitch.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/irSvSTXb_xw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

889~~~
That performance looks like something that might be on par with one of his best games in a United shirt. 

One of the reasons why I think KDB is being seriously over rated by many and his price tag was laughable.

890~~~
Fascinating what you can learn from a performance in a meaningless friendly against a club not even playing in the Bundesliga.

891~~~
Yeah and if you watch the whole game you can see how much work it takes to play an offensive position at Dortmund. The fluidity of our attacking play is of course positive for offensive contribution, because it adds (passing) options and makes it less predictable, but at the same time fluidity can also turn into vulnerability very quickly when the defensive discipline is not there. More static setups are more stable by nature, because they are less chaotic and the positioning is easier to learn and master, the roles are more rigid. In systems as ours this vulnerability is countered by collective defending of the whole team. This defending is also not only about back tracking, but about strong positional play to block passing routes aswell. Without that the space which is naturally created by our heavy rotation on the pitch can be used to punish us on the counter. That means that every player activiely works vs. the ball, including the striker. No one can hope to get seriously involved if he just waits for the ball to come to him.

This is where I see the most work for Januzaj and also where he will struggle at first. There is no shame in that, though, because not only does he have no experience playing such a (physically and mentally) demanding style, but it is even normal for players to have a hard time to completely get that system down. The list of these players is long and colorful and quite frankly the only two players who excelled in that department from the start were Kagawa and Mkhitaryan, who are both naturally very gifted in terms of pressing play.

Overall, the first days for Januzaj were pretty positive, where he left a good first impression on the coach and teammates, who all described him as quiet, but also open minded and actively seeking guidance of other players. There is a visible effort to become a part of the family from the start, which is the most important thing.

Still, it wouldn´t be unwise to reign in some expectations here. A friendly vs. a 2nd league side, which gave their academy players as much opportunities as we did, is not the measure stick here. Nobody should feel disheartened about not seeing him start in any Bundesliga game in September for example, because I expect Tuchel to get him get used to league and it´s own style (especially the high focus on pressing) via sub appearances, because the advantage in stamina will probably make it a bit easier for him. At the same time I expect to see a lot of him in the EL, not only to give the key players opportunities to rest, but also because they are ideal to make him comfortable with our system.

Starting October the integration period will be over, though, and then the only things that decide who plays will be performances. Thats the problem with the deal. There is not much time, so he has to learn quickly.

892~~~
Seemed like he had a very good game from those highlighs. Very different role from how he played for us with a lot more fluidity which suits him well, hopefully he can develop well there.

893~~~
He has too much talent to not be a very good player as long as his attitude is semi decent which it seems.

Unfortunately don't see it being at United if LVG's still here. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

894~~~
It's not because he 'has the freedom to go round the pitch', look how much space he is getting. Premiership is very fast paced aggressive football and when 80% of teams play man united they sit back and constrict space. Januzaj is thriving on not being passed the ball and turning into chelsea or stoke playing 2 banks of 4 on the edge of their box

895~~~
^It's a combination of that and the fact under LVG we've not really the type of team that passes to feet when the player (asking for the ball) is under pressure. Call it player fear, inability or whatnot but it's those 50/50 situations which creates pockets of space with those half turns etc. In that video, he lost the ball quite a few times but also managed to create space despite being inbetween players and was able to play it forward/progressively. If you play those balls regularly, only then can your players build from that and break down tight defences. 

Despite all the ridicule and criticism Falcao and RVP got, it was natural to their game to play intuitively between lines and they showed it enough times for me that the problem wasn't their movement but our lack of pace on the ball. There's not many players in the world, who could take a ball from a standing start with no movement around them and create something i.e there has to be pace on/off the ball, movement from team mates. 

Right now we pass when players are already set and that's basically an uphill battle when you want players to create things. Schweinsteiger has rightfully and equally wrongly been called out for his 'inconsistent' passing but that's because he plays the ball when players are on the move (the same goes for his own movement as he moves with and without the ball, a massive contrast to Carrick); it creates pace on the ball and opportunity for the receiver.

Good post, keep us updated with his progress!

896~~~
I didn't realise St. Pauli got relegated. Also reckon Januzaj will have many performances like that in this season.

897~~~
St. Pauli played one season in the Bundesliga in the last decade, that was 5 years ago and they finished dead last that season. They barely escaped relegation into the 3rd league last season, finishing 15th out of 18 last year in the 2nd Bundesliga. But good to know that your opinion on German football is based on so much knowledge and that you have an open mind about it. And I'm still fascinated how much you can take away from watching a short video of a player in a friendly during the international break with both teams using quite a few youth players. You'd make a fantastic scout for a pro football team, maybe you should apply for a job at United?

898~~~
Most teams park the bus against Dortmund, too. It´s the problem Klopp could never solve. His Dortmund and LVG´s United look very similar in that regard. Possession going nowhere, only OG is not as deadly in the Bundesliga. 

As for Januzaj. He has a high pass completion rate, but also seems to like to dribble a lot, which leads to turnovers. What he can learn under Tuchel in the current Dortmund side, is to use the unselfish passing more and pick his dribbling spots better. Making the extra pass and making the runs is what Dortmund have done brilliantly so far this season.

899~~~
As expected Januzaj on the bench vs. Hanover, Hofmann comes in for the slightly injured Reus.

900~~~
He's in for Hofmann.

901~~~
How did he do?

Got a assist!

Assist. Get in!

904~~~
He did well. He'll have to get used to the amount of defensive work Dortmund do.

905~~~
<a class="username" data-user="70116, @Sphaero" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/70116/">@Sphaero</a> How did he do? From a 1-10 performance scale?

906~~~
When? The goals when he was on the pitch were assisted by Ginter (OG) and Kagawa (Pen).

Still a good debut. Nice and tidy on the ball, some good space opening passes and two decent dribblings (both resulting in corners). Overall a performance to build on. Will probably start his first game on Thursday in the EL.

7-8

907~~~
Just saw on Reddit that he got a assist but when viewing the gifs I couldn't see it.

Decent sub apearance ,dribbled passed two, found some nice passes to his team mates,looks go on ball.It would take some to adopt to Dortmond pace.It just his first game and he would learn a lot.

Sounds like most of his games for us <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
I cant help feeling a bit bitter about this. 
Martial cheered me up obviously but i was kind of cursing van gaal when we couldn't bring januzaj on at half time or when young looked like he might have got injured.

Feck it i guess, gives a bit of space to lingard and perreira and could do him a lot of good
*shakes fist at van gaal anyway*

I still think he's overrated because he was the only bit of joy in that season of shit under Moyes which made everyone view him differently.

Never heard it put like that before, Elmo. I guess he really was shite then.

You know you can evaluate a player without taking into account how bad the team was. He had a great season. Had United been flying that season, he still would have had a great season as an 18 year old.

922~~~
In the presser for upcoming match vs. Krasnodar there was a specific question regarding Januzaj´s integration and chances to play tomorrow:

Head coach Tuchel first of all praised Januzaj´s attitude in training, calling him very open minded, diligent and eager to become part of the team (in a social sense). He appears to enjoy his time and is happy with his current process (literally: "Coming to training with a smile on his face every day") and is already very well integrated, which is not natural for every player joining the team in the middle of the season.

In terms of chances to play, Tuchel once again referenced Adnan´s starts for United and his good performance in the game vs. St. Pauli as clear signs of him being a definite option already. He was also content with his sub appearance in his official debut. On the other hand, he stated that the high intensity in games and training (this I personally found interesting) is something he still has to get used too. The coach is confident his "absolutely obvious" abilities and potential will finish this process quickly, though.


My intepretation: He will definitively play tomorrow, unless injuries force us to sub differently. If he will start will depend on the volume of rotation Tuchel will choose. The next hard Bundesliga game vs. Leverkusen could point towards a heavier rotation while Krasnodar being our most serious opponent in the group could make him choose something closer to the best XI. The only things definite at this point are, that Reus won´t play (is expected to rejoin training on Friday) and that we will swap GK´s once again.

The game begins 6pm English time tomorrow, the starting formation is published one hour before that.

Great post <a class="username" data-user="70116, @Sphaero" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/70116/">@Sphaero</a> thanks for keeping us updated.

924~~~
I wonder what he meant with the high intensity in training and games. I doubt that the game intensity is that much higher in the Bundesliga or that we have an "easy" training under LVG

925~~~
I thought LVG's training was very intense? Why the hell are our players complaining?

926~~~
Thanks for keeping us in the loop <a class="username" data-user="70116, @Sphaero" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/70116/">@Sphaero</a>

927~~~
One criticism one could levy at Januzaj is that he's comes across as someone who waits too much for the game to come to him. His intensity at times isn't quite what it could be. I think tuchel's Dortmund play frantically than klopp's but the majority of the players are the same so I imagine Januzaj might possibly have to up his off the ball game.

928~~~
What he needs at this stage, more than anything else, is to find a definite position to play in and play in that position on a regular basis. If he doesn't I'm not sure he will develop right.

Dortmund is a great place for him - IF he gets the time on the pitch.

I'm still not sure if he's best as a no.10 or a left-winger. I don't like him on the right particularly. I think probably I would say he needs to play left wing.

Problem is, that's where Reus plays. Oh and then there's Mkhitaryan and Kagawa in the middle...

929~~~
From what Van Gaal was saying it sounds a bit lifestyle and attitude oriented as well. I am sure he will be okay, I think this will give him a bit of a reality check. The lad has considerable talent but not all things are given on a plate.

930~~~
I don't think having a set position is that important right now. I think he just needs to add some physicality to his game this season, get stronger, learn to protect the ball etc. Once he is able to handle that side of the game his natural ability should shine through in any attacking role.

931~~~
Funnily enough, this is where he is praised the most by Tuchel at the Moment, who himself has a very high standart in that regard. Maybe being sending him on a loan in the first place already sparked that change, but it is of course also possible that their problems came from both sides and Tuchel simply connected better with him.

932~~~
He's the type of player that won't really have a typical position, though. Seems to be a vogue recently for tricksy, attacking midfielders who don't hold down any one specific position. I'd be hard pressed to say exactly which position players like Chamberlain, Oscar, Willian, Reus, Goetze or Sterling actually plays. Not quite wingers, not quite number 10s either. They might settle into one role or another as they mature but they do seem to be expected to play left, right or central as required while they're still developing.

933~~~
That's the key, if he plays regularly in attacking / wide midfield he should develop nicely.

934~~~
Chamberlain has the same problem. Sterling had a good season when on the right wing, a much less good season when shifted about. He will likely do well at City because he will play mostly on the right. Reus can change but is based mostly on the left and in any case has already matured. Oscar is either a central midfielder or a 10 and he has the same problem. Goetze's form has been a bit dodgy, I'd say he has the same problem. Willian is best wide right etc.

The best players develop best when given a single primary role. See Giggs. He played occasional games as a second striker or switching to the right but he really developed on the left wing. Someone needs to make this choice for Januzaj. I think he wants to be a 10 but his game is not really mature enough for this at the top level and he will benefit a lot in discipline and in effectiveness if he focuses on the requirements of playing as a left winger. Where, in fact, he had his best season for us. It's perhaps not so important what the position is, it's just very difficult for a player to do consistently well when shifted about.

It's true that minutes on the pitch is more important than anything but I would hate to see him filling in all over the place or used as an impact sub as you can't learn the game properly that way.

935~~~
Sterling was at his best playing through the middle with Suarez and Sturridge ahead of him. Chelsea fans would probably tell you Willian is at his best in the #10 role as well.

936~~~
I'm old school and prefer footballers to have consistent, strict positions. It just doesn't seem the done thing anymore, particularly with attacking midfielders now so few teams play with conventional wingers. I named a bunch of players off the top of my head there but could probably name more if I thought about it longer. How about Mahrez at Leicester, or Eriksen at Spurs? Wingers? Number 10s? Neither?

He's at the right club for attacking midfielders that are neither 10s or wingers, that's for sure!

937~~~
Thinking about it, who is the best 'conventional' winger out there? They all just want to cut in and score/dictate play through the centre. Now even Bale plays through the middle too.

938~~~
Mahrez plays on the right, Eriksen through the middle. They aren't swapped around that much... it makes it very difficult to have a good run of form.

939~~~
There kind of isn't any. Navas is probably the only one at a top PL club and they seem even rarer in Europe (although admittedly I don't watch much non-PL football, so could be wrong about this). Even if you do get someone who plays nominally wide, chances are they'll be on the "wrong" wing, so constantly drift into central areas anyway.

940~~~
The traditional Winger's role has been filled by full backs.

941~~~
I believe that Dortmund's training sessions are different to our's. Januzaj may have to attack open space a lot in Dortmund, making runs, trying to shake defenders of his shoulders and play with  the ball at full speed, which I do not think he experienced much at United under LvG.

942~~~
Why? Dortmund play quite possession heavy themselves atm. According to whoscored's data they actually average about 5 percentage points more than United.

Here's a decent article in English that's having a look at their tactical setup:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://spielverlagerung.com/2015/09/15/team-analysis-tuchels-borussia-dortmund/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://spielverlagerung.com/2015/09/15/team-analysis-tuchels-borussia-dortmund/</a>

943~~~
But in a much more fluid way. Van Gaal's possession system is rather static in comparison to the Cruyff school that influenced Sacchi and Guardiola and Tuchel looks like he's a bigger fan of the more chaotic one than the crazy organised version of it.

I wouldn't read too much into these comments about the intensity of the training though. You can read something like that almost every time a player moves. Usually it's just different and therefore often feels more intense because you have to get used to new methods in the beginning. I'd be very surprised if van Gaal's training lacks intensity. That certainly didn't seem to be the case ever at Bayern.

944~~~
Yeah, I know that Dortmund play differently to United, but his comment suggests to me that he believes that Dortmund are about counter attacking, when they actually are quite the opposite now.

945~~~
Yeah, that's definitely true. Though the quick transitions are still the best way to goals for Dortmund, but quite clearly there's a lot more to the team than that and those quick transitions start now in a different way than they did under Klopp.

946~~~
I am becoming more optimistic about Januzaj's loan working out and him returning a better player after this 'process' to United. Maybe Van Gaal decided to sacrifice in the short term, by not keeping him as an attacking option for this season, to be in a better position in the long term. Hope he gets good opportunities in Dortmund and applies himself well.

947~~~
Since Januzaj's chances of playing are obviously not better at Dortmund wouldn't that mean that he (implicitly) admits that Tuchel is the better coach (for Januzaj)? That wouldn't strike me as a typical van Gaal thought.

948~~~
Well I was kind of hoping that his chances to play would be better at Dortmund, especially the comments posted by <a class="username" data-user="70116, @Sphaero" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/70116/">@Sphaero</a> seemed quite positive. But if he doesn't feature much, I kind of agree with you. Although Van Gaal did allude to the need to changing his lifestyle and something about his lifestyle to justify this loan. Maybe he felt that Januzaj was becoming a bit complacent (although I have always thought that he is very dedicated). Anyway we will see. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

949~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if he plays a good amount at Dortmund, but it's not like United's bench is looking strong either. And (at least in both squad's current form) to me it seems like United's first XI is actually way easier to break into. If van Gaal really rates the kid he shouldn't have trouble giving him at least as much playtime as Tuchel will.

950~~~
He'd have got more time in the first team here. It was a bizarre decision, made even more ridiculous considering our current attacking options.

We had to resort to Valencia as an attacking option again the other night ffs. And don't tell me Valencia is a better option then Januzaj.

951~~~
Starting in the Europa League, hope he has a good game.

952~~~
Just tuned in. Anyone watching? How's he played so far?

953~~~
Lovely pass there from Januzaj. Mykhtarian should have done better.

954~~~
I have said Januzaj looks like a #10 in the future, but for now the position he is best in is probably left wing, that is where we have seen his best performances.

955~~~
hes looked really good playing the reus role for dortmund today..starting on the right but drifting to the left to create an overload..worked really well for their opening goal.

956~~~
Just crafted a lovely chance for himself.

957~~~
Its okay lads, we've got Valencia <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

958~~~
Still in absolute shock that he was sent out on loan. Criminal.

959~~~
Strange to say the least. Hopefully he has a real season of development.

960~~~
And hopefully we may be sweetening up Dortmund for a certain player of theirs, I can dream anyway.

961~~~
As long as it doesn't involve Januzaj going the other way.

But yeah, MFR to join BFS <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

962~~~
Yes, maybe they'll sell us their Ramos.

963~~~
Playing really well today, been Dortmund's best attacker. If only his shot had gone in, would have been the perfect game.

964~~~
He meant Kagawa... <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

965~~~
That would coincide with a new poster subtly named Mad Winger 2.0 signing up to the Caf!

966~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

967~~~
involved in both goals. went a bit missing in the second half because of being played centrally. was best when given freedom to roam. hopefully tuchel will stop playing him there

968~~~

feck, wrong thread. Sorry

<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

972~~~
Not sure if Kagawa is interested.

973~~~
Instead of trying to be number 10 so much, id try win that right wing position if I was him. Id pay close attention to how Mata plays and try see what qualities LVG likes in Juan. Mata plays like a wide number 10, you would think that with Adnan's skill set, that role would be perfect for him and us.

974~~~
Dortmund is definitely the right fit for him. Good loan deal.

975~~~
Imagine what he'd be like playing for Man Utd.... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

976~~~
Good loan deal. Whatever the cost is to us of not having him this season, him developing as a player will be worth it.

977~~~
It's because he has freedom to go wherever. It's a lot like how he played for the youth teams. Whenever he played on the wing for United he didn't have the same freedom. He was everywhere today. Right wing, centrally, left wing, and up top in the 2nd half.

978~~~
Yeah, sure, I mean who the hell is this scrub Marco Reus anyway, right? People put also way too much emphasis on fixed positions in our system. Maybe the game today was misleading, because it was by far the most static offensive formation we played in this season so far, especially in the first half (probably because both Park and Januzaj are not completely used to the movement,yet). Our front four unsually interchanges positions way more than they did today. The spot on the team sheet is often not important, because the offensive players of us are expected to move in large radiuses anyway. 

I also disagree with the poster, who said that being played centrally resulted in his fading from the game. He had some of his best scenes being played as lead of the offense line in the first 20-25 minutes of the second half. The reason he fell off at the end is way more simpler than where he was played: He was visibly tired, which led to his movement being less sharp than for the rest of the game, which in turn limited his contribution to the offense. This was both expected and completely alright at this point.

Furthermore, I seriously doubt that Januzaj approaches his time with us with the goal to play the closest to what LvG wants to see in an offensive midfielder or like Juan Mata. If he would do that, he can pack his bags again already, because that is not why he is there. We have not loaned him to prepare him for his future United career, but to play him where he is needed and do what Tuchel demands of him (which could be very different thing to what van Gaal wants). At least for this season the only thing that matters is what Tuchel wants, because he decides how much game time he gets. It is Januzaj´s job to adapt to our style or else thinking about making the start XI would not even be a concern anymore, because he would struggle to get minutes.

979~~~
Did he play on the right wing? How did he do?

980~~~
Oh I meant if/when he comes back to United, not talking about Dortmund in my post.

981~~~
cant agree with that. apart from a turn and a shot and a shot from outside the box which was blocked he didnt do much in the second half till he was shifted back to the left (where he played a part in the second goal). Aubameyang also became ineffective when he was shifted to the right to accommodate januzaj in a central position which ulitmately lead to him being substituted for ramos. 
when januzaj was allowed to roam he did well. just like mikhitaryan kagawa reus and even mata hes a creative player who functions best in the channel between the wing and central areas and thats where he should be operating not centrally.

982~~~
For Utd, I don't know about that because it certainly doesn't come across during games. Our intensity levels during games are quite pathetic really and we look almost lethargic (when in possession).

If the recent comments LVG made with regards to Rooney and Carrick coming to speak to him are anything to go by, I think LVG's sessions are probably lengthy and require energy/stamina.

Tuchel's sessions are probably intensive in the Barca 7 second mould, which is what we should be striving to do. It's all good theory to have these '3 stages of transition' but the more direct and effective thing would be absolute bat sh|t crazy intense pressing within 7 seconds of losing the ball and applying that when attacking the goal, than trying to naively draw out your average (league and european) team, who is super fit, tactically sound and more than decent on the goal not to mention having goal threat themselves.  

Ok rant over. Sorry.

Gonna try and find highlights for Januzaj's game tonight. Cheers for the updates!

984~~~
I honestly prefer to see Januzaj out wide anyway - he has some pace and the ability to beat a man. I see him as an inside forward along the same lines as Memphis, Nani, Robben or Bale, rather than a "crossing" winger or a wide #10 a-la Mata.

There is an argument to be had that you want variation in your wide players, and with Memphis on the left, our team balance is better if we have someone on the other side who can offer something a bit different, but I have not really been convinced by Januzaj in a central role. If anything I could see him as a False 9 playing centrally, but not as the #10 for me - we should strive to find someone like Silva for that.

985~~~
Hope to god that we don't feck it up with this guy. He has the talent to make it here

986~~~
This loan deal is starting to make more and more sense to me.

Game time aside (he probably could of got a comparable amount of minutes at UTD), I think the move to a different club and different country is good for his personal development.

At Dortmund he is not the golden boy from the academy, the great hope who was given the #11 jersey. He is just another footballer who has to prove his worth and fight for his spot.

I am not saying he was complacent at UTD, but this loan could have a very positive effect on his attitude and personality

987~~~
Good solid performance. That shot on the turn was excellent. Taking their set pieces too, good to see.

988~~~
That turn and shot at 5:23...remind anyone of Macheda's goal?

Looks like he had a really good game. I like many was disappointed we let him go but if he continues to get chances I think it can only be good for him. (Even though we could have made use of him).

989~~~
So this could work out like Matic or De Bruyne, without the whole being sold and bought back again thing.

990~~~
or maybe he ends up being one of those players who shine elsewhere but don't seem to fit English football. Hopefully it's your way though...

991~~~
We sure there isnt a fee set?

992~~~
It could go either way alright. The fact he's spent so much of his footballing education in England, as well as putting in some excellent PL performances means he has a better chance than most of making the transition. That's why I mentioned Matic and De Bruyne. Neither of them are as big a gamble as someone with no experience of English football.

993~~~
It is highly unlikely that he makes such a big jump in his development as those two did. Matic and De Bruyne had completely different standings at their clubs. If they were fit, they played. For Adnan, it is basically the opposite, he has to hope that one of the regulars are not fit, so he gets starts in the bigger games. 

He had a good start with us but you can expect that he returns to the bench again for the next game vs. Leverkusen, because Reus has participated in the team training today without any problems.

994~~~
I think we can safely assume there isn't. But there have been whisperings of first option. There was no loan fee and I think we are still paying his wages. This move is strictly for his development imo.

995~~~
Very good performance that.

996~~~
They did at the end, yes. They started off exactly like Januzaj though. Needing to prove themselves and force their way into the team at the expense of established players.

997~~~
I have the feeling that Januzaj still lacks a lot in terms of tactical or positional awareness.
The way Dortmund are set up you have the fullbacks playing the winger role and the 3 AMs are working in the center or half spaces, most of the time they clump up a bit left of the center, since that's the side where Hummels and Mkhitaryan play and Kagawa naturally tends to drift to the left too, when the opponents then react by shifting to their side (if they don't Dortmund threaten to overload very dangerous areas) it leaves a massive gap on their other wing, which Dortmund/Ginter often exploit with a quick switch to the other side.
Januzaj on the other hand seems to stay wide a lot of the times, where he takes away the space of the full back and leaves Dortmund with a man down in the center of the pitch, which makes them a lot more rigid.



So you think Bremen and Dortmund are comparable?

To make things clearer: de Bruyne started every single match bar one where he was injured very late into the season. Bremen was already a shadow of it's former self and bar de Bruyne none of their offensive players would probably be even close to making the Dortmund bench this year.

998~~~
Matic and De Bryne were much older. Januzaj is far more of a work-in-progress. I'm very confident of him making it with us. Hopefully this season pushes his development along nicely before he comes back to us next season. 

I'm not expecting him to come back as a world beater, but definitely having him back on the back of a good season will be great.

999~~~
I'm assuming that's not his argument. Maybe one of the more established attackers gets sidelined for a couple of months (not wishing injury on the players mind), and Adnan delivers good performances to hang on to the role; or maybe Kagawa's (to cite one player) form drops off, and Adnan dislodges him as the starter after impressing Tuchel in the training ground (starts delivering on the manager's demands), and keeps on building from there. Just situations of that nature, a lot can change quickly in football, and there are multiple factors that we can't account for right now. No one thought Kaka would displace Rui Costa, the assumption was he was heading out on loan. Not drawing a parallel, but just to illustrate the point.

Every young player needs one big opportunity to break through, and step up a level in terms of performances. Matic and De Bruyne got theirs at Benfica and Bremen, and delivered with aplomb, even though both were largely written off by a lot of Chelsea fans. Maybe Januzaj will get his at Dortmund, maybe he won't, maybe Tuchel will be reluctant to rely on him heavily as a starter given the nature of the loan deal. Bremen wasn't comparable to Dortmund, but that's beside the point.

1000~~~
Very good performance, still think he should be here with us, as I saw enough in the few games he played to show he could have had a decent season. Anyway lets hope he is with us next season full of confidence.

1001~~~
Yeah but KdB (can't comment on Matic at Benfica, since I don't watch that league) didn't have to wait for maybes to happen. When he joined them he already was one of their first options. Him playing most matches was expected. 
Januzaj joined Dortmund with the perspective to be a bench player, which makes both loans rather different in nature.

1002~~~
Fair enough. Though again, I doubt people are drawing direct parallels between the natures of their loan deals, the comparison is more of a casual simile. You're right about how the relative squad strengths factor into Adnan's development. Bremen didn't have Reus and Mkhitaryan and Kagawa, or even Hoffman to offer competition. That's kind of a given. But folks are just hoping that the end result is similar, rather than the process itself, or atleast that he shows the promise of further developing and polishing his game like De Bruyne did. Albeit to a lesser level in terms of progress if he understandably plays fewer minutes.

1003~~~
What <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>?

De Bruyne started his first available match (vs. us actually) and by the end of that game every Bremen supporter, rival fan or neutral spectator knew he was by quite a distance their best offensive player. Consequently he started every game he was available (he missed one with a light injury) and played all of them bar one over the whole distance. He even got away with complaining about Bremen and Germany in interviews and still played every minute. Similar to him, Matic was also immediate starter for Vitesse.

There is a massive difference between the loan deals of Matic and De Bruyne and the one of Januzaj. The first two were about temporaly increasing the strength of the first XI of their clubs. The last one is about squad depth, about having cover for the first XI. Nobody in Dortmund actually went into this deal with the expectation or thought of Januzaj becoming a full fledged starter. He is supposed to protect us from a too strong drop in quality if one our first choice options get injured or need rest.

To be completely honest, anyone believing Januzaj might actually push out one of our first three offensive midfielder based on performance alone (he would need to outperform them consistently) is either massively overrating Januzaj´s current abilities or underrating our players. He will never get past Reus, because even without top form the German is still the bigger game changer, Mkhitaryan is besides his current scoring abilities (which are far superior to the ones of Adnan) extremely valuable in terms of pressing and by far our strongest midfielder in terms of defensive contribution and Kagawa is part of the creative spine, whom the team is built around.

1004~~~
Some good moments in those clips. Great to see him having an impact on his loan

1005~~~
Feck me. The pedantry in this thread. And that's speaking as a massive pedant! The analogy is simple. Young players that left the PL with something to prove, became a key player in a different league and came back as established top class players. Which is obviously what we're hoping happens with Januzaj. So far so good on that front, I'd say.

Re the competition for places at Dortmund if he can't prove himself a better player than Kagawa I'm not sure I want him back...

1006~~~
He's just 20.

Why would we give up on such a talented young player at the age of 21? Kagawa has years of proven performances in Germany and with Dortmund. It will far easier for him to stamp his authority, not to mention he's actually their player.

I just want Januzaj to come back more confident and further in his development. He's not going to come back as an established top class player at the age of 21.

1007~~~
Fecking hell. I'm not writing off anyone! I just think Januzaj will become a much better player than Kagawa. I'm not putting a timeframe on it but I'd be disappointed if he ended up no better than the player who flattered to deceive in the PL.

1008~~~
Damn, I wish MadWinger was still with us.

1009~~~
Ah I just got the context of that. Cheers.

I agree. If Januzaj doesn't become a fair bit better than Kagawa it would through a lack of application IMO. He's far too talented.

1010~~~
It sure is, because it ignores all the circumstances, but carry on...

Eh, of course you do. You expect him to replace Kagawa in the running season. It also does not matter how Kagawa fared in the EPL here, because both don´t compete vs. each other there. The Bundesliga and Europa league is the battlefield here.

1011~~~
Yep, pretty much this. I also suspect Adnan might be a late developer, which from a supporter's perspective can be a death knell for young players in an age of statistical minutiae, twits, vine and instant gratification. He still possesses excellent technique that a lot of people have commented on, can see passes a lot of players his age don't, people criticize his lack of intelligence but IMO he lacks more in decisiveness and decision making consistency than overall footballing intelligence, which is kind of understandable given his age. All kind of patented traits for players that mature well with some tread under the tires, plus he's not as well developed physically when compared with a Shaw or Memphis, and will likely fill out slowly. The club needs to be a bit more patient with him. The talent is there (understand some don't see it at all, which is fair enough I guess), he just needs some direction and regular minutes to kind of pull it all together.

1012~~~
Adnan will displace Kagawa in no time.
There is no way he was wanted on loan as cover who will play the odd game and find it difficult being 3/4th choice. If anybody thinks Adnan was told this and still agreed to leave is out of their minds. Why leave as a starter for United for that?
LVG specifically said he was sent on loan for games, not a chance he was sent to Dortmund as 3rd / 4th choice to have less game time if what is being said in here is true.
For all the talk of underestimating Dortmund players there is massive underestimating of Adnan and the actual situation.

1013~~~
Kagawa is doing well for Dortmund in both attack and defense, while Adnan is competing with Reus. I doubt it.

1014~~~
Yeah. I'm sure he was guaranteed a starting spot at Dortmund <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1015~~~
Yeah, januzaj is shit. He has no hope at all of playing regularly at a club filled with world class talents playing in such a tactically wonderful and complex league. A huge step up from playing for silly old United in the hoofball premier league.

1016~~~
Agree. 

Decisiveness, and intensity, to an extent. Vision and understanding of the game has never been an issue. When he doesn't have less time to think he comes up with surprisingly good pieces of skill and thought.

1017~~~
exactly!


<span style="color: #ffffff">drama queen much?</span>

1018~~~
From reports around that time PSG / Juve / PSV and the like were after him. He must be the thickest player in the world to accept the scenario you've been painting in this thread.
He'll have had a talk with the manager about his development and what is expected of him. It's not as if he was coming from a hopeless situation at United or was short of loan options.
I remember when United were furious with Newcastle over their treatment of Rossi when we sent him there. It hasn't happened since and I'll be shocked if it's happening now

I think going to Dortmund will improve these parts of his game. First of all because of their pressing game and also because of their players playing faster than we did at United. You kind of have to up your intensity with how they press. It will be a good learning experience for him.

1020~~~
What picture am I painting exactly? At the moment it will probably be 50/50 between him and Hofmann, but if he settles in well he has a good chance to be Dortmund's first bench player. Do you think PSG or Juve would have offered him more on a loan?

1021~~~
I think he participated pretty well in the overload on the left which dortumd use  under tuchel. He offers something different to reus since he moves to the touchline and invites a defender out of position unlike reus who just stays in the half space making the area more compact. This also allows schmelzer to make diagonal runs into the half space rather than just hugging the touchline. Both goals yesterday came from Januzaj using the touchline beating a man and creating an imbalance in the marking system leading to more space on the underloaded side. 
So no I think he fits fine with Dortmund and offers them something different when played in the reus/free to roam position. One thing he does lack is the quick passing rhythm of Dortmund. He tends to slow the game down to his pace. We will find out with more games if that suits tuchels system or not. I see him getting a lot opportunities to impress.

1022~~~
If he were offered the same opportunities from all of those clubs why would he pick Dortmund?

1023~~~
Dunno, maybe he likes our play style, the league or our stadium? You need to ask him. What I seriously doubt is that there were any promises about the games where he starts for us. The only one who decides that is the coach and Tuchel was hardly involved in this signing process (that was all handled by DoF Zorc) outside of identifying him as a good option for us.  

The only way Januzaj gets into the starting line up in important games is by impressing Tuchel enough in training and matches to leave out one of Reus, Mkhitaryan and Kagawa, which will be hard because all of them are currently performing on a higher level than him. If that would be a long term deal, his potential might make a vital difference for him, but with the deal being as it is the only thing that matters is what he can bring on the pitch right now.

1024~~~
Being too respectful there. There's no bloody way a player on loan at a club like Dortmund gets guarantees about game time. Not when he isn't even better than their starters. Had Januzaj demanded the same, he wouldn't be at Dortmund now. Clubs that big don't go around guaranteeing game time to their own players, let alone some kid on loan.

1025~~~
But both Schmelzer and Ginter are rather limited. Doesn't it make much more sense to have it the other way round and let the more dangerous attacker exploit that pocket of space?

Who knows how interested Juventus and PSG were this summer, who knows what role they offered him. And even if all three offered him the same perspective maybe he prefered Bundesliga or Dortmund's style?

1026~~~
Different player when given the freedom to create and find pockets and channels.  Truly can create a moment of magic and scoring chance out of nothing, but because of this he also gives the ball away a little more than others.  As much as I want to see him make it here, I just can't see him ever prospering under LVG's style.  Hope I am proven wrong but looked a different player yesterday - flashes of the past in the Moyes era.

1027~~~
Very impressive performance. Could be a seriously good player by the time he comes back.

1028~~~
He's been training with Dortmund for how long? A week now? It's not like what you're seeing from him right now is a step in his development, it's probably just the difference in style between Dortmund and United.

1029~~~
Yes! Exactly. Fans assume any player with skill and vision should end up in the hole these days. But if you have that playmaking ability <i>and</i> you can dribble at pace and beat a man, it's better to start from a wide position and then you have the option of <i>either</i> cutting inside to look for a shot/through ball <i>or </i>going down the outside and beating your man.

Multitalented players need to be in positions where they can potentially exploit all their various strengths, not just some of them. That's what makes them hard to defend against.

1030~~~
I wouldn't say shmelzer is limited. He contributes a lot positionally. He was involved in the first goal yesterday exactly from the position that I wrote about. Ginter on the other hand is a CB and is being played IMO exactly for that aerial prowess at the back post which keeps the ball in the dangerous/pressure area if he doesn't score like he did yesterday. It would also depend on the oppositions weaknesses. Its possible that ginter not piszezck plays against a small left back even if its a top notch opposition. 
I think Januzaj offers something different compared to Reus and that's also important. He might not get regular game time when reus is fit but I expect him to come on when Dortmund can't find a way through..I think tuchel already trusts him

1031~~~
Who said that?

1032~~~
Your post looked like excitement to me.

1033~~~
Yeah sorry on behalf of the caf posters. We'll make sure noone gets excited watching our loaned player do well this season.

1034~~~
Not saying people shouldn't get excited. I'm just surprised that people don't ask why Januzaj is already looking good after just one week with his new team. I mean either you have to assume that something at United held him back or wonder why van Gaal would loan out such a player, because what he showed at Dortmund thus far suggests that he could help United's team a lot.

1035~~~
You seem intent on making this a "united problem", whereas fans are content and happy seeing their loaned player do well.

Also people are over analytical/critical of players who are actually in our team. Our attack has lacked goals, so every part of that attack is criticized. Januzaj actually did quite well in the three starts he got this season. Like in your game, he always produces nice moments here and there of genuine quality. But when United are failing to score it matters. Whereas if Dortmund are scoring, even if it's not him scoring, his nice moments look better.

What we need for him is to get more games than LVG believed he would have here, and improve. That's what matters. I don't think I saw a DIFFERENT JANUZAJ for your lot yesterday. But he started, and played a little better than he has for us.

Sometimes a change of environment can also be good for a player.

1036~~~
Newsflash: he has also looked good playing for United.

Obviously, he didn't get to play many games against opposition as poor as the side Dortmund needed an injury time goal to beat. So that should be taken into account too.

1037~~~
I had the impression that his moments of individual class were less frequent for United.

And I'm not trying to hide that I see this loan as a strange piece of business from United's point of view.

1038~~~
You're trying too hard to show it. We all get it.

If he progresses well we'll be happy even if the loan confused many at first.

And you're talking as if he was world class last night and Dortmund extracted from him what we've never EVER seen. Good game, but the team he was playing was a joke compared to the high intensity PL games.

Also, if he does indeed put on cracking performances, I can assure you that's an outcome that is welcome at OT.

1039~~~
Less frequent as in, less than once per week? As you just reminded us, he's only been playing at Dortmund for a week.

1040~~~
Schmelzer just isn't great on the ball. His technique isn't sharp, so he loses precious time while getting the ball under control. He also isn't a great passer: his short passes are okay, but he isn't exactly the player who offers penetration and he's also not the best at taking on other players.
His crossing has been decent this season, but that's probably another reason why he should stay wide.

It worked for the equalizer, but in general Schmelzer just isn't the player you want to have in a packed central area, because he's simply not nearly as effective as one of the AMs and part of the reason why Dortmund didn't have a great game yesterday was imho that they really lacked presence in the central area, at times it reminded me a bit of last season. Obviously this wasn't all Januzaj's fault since the other players Tuchel brought into the team didn't have great games, but I think this will be a problem for him against better sides.
Obviously he played well individually and having a more individualistic approach is a decent plan B if things aren't going so well for you, but I assume that Januzaj will try to be more than that.

Less frequently as in less good scenes per playtime.


I'm not saying his performance was world class and I already said that I don't think that much changes in one week.
My impression is just that he's playing better than at United, which makes me wonder why, especially because I already thought of this as a strange move.
Maybe he's the type of player who get's excited about new challenges and channels it into performance, maybe I'm just underrating his United performance, or maybe it's about the teams. Who knows? That's why most people share some of their thoughts in a forum.

1041~~~
I'm the biggest Januzaj fanboy on this forum and even I'd say that's an overreaction. It's a wonderful loan for him - a risky one, no doubt, but potentially the making of him, a Lukaku-at-Everton or Courtois-at-Atletico sort of loan. (Hopefully the latter, because Lukaku's still at Everton! <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>)

1042~~~
Nah, that's simply not true. The one thing he always offered was moments of class. In his best games it was every time he got on the ball. The problem - well, aside from the fact that he simply never got any consistent game time after that first six months under Moyes - was whether he consistently contributed in between those moments.

I'd go so far as to say that Januzaj has already done three or four things on the pitch for United which require more skill than <i>anything</i> Ashley Young has done in his entire career with us. But these days every single time Young goes forwards he creates an attacking situation. He doesn't always leave two men on the ground or get the crowd on their feet with some wonderful dribbling or a vicious through-ball. But with a good brain, reasonable pace, good quick feet and most importantly a gritty determination to force himself or the ball into dangerous positions one way or another, he consistently creates useful situations. And unfortunately it's very hard for a manager under constant pressure to leave a player like that (for example) out in order to play Januzaj, who could have a stormer and leave the entire opposition defence with twisted blood, but who could also just provide a few lovely moments without ever creating a single proper attack.

In the end, you have to believe that Van Gaal has the foresight and patience to see that Januzaj can become a player who will use that prodigious ability with more consistency. But you can't necessarily <i>blame</i> him for not just giving Januzaj a regular spot in the first XI, no questions asked, even if it's not really Januzaj's fault either. Sometimes these things just take time.

1043~~~
Really? I actually thought they were a decent side. I mean, I don´t want to make them bigger than they are, but they are clearly our strongest opponent in the group and certainly not cannon fodder, especially defensively. From what I have seen of them, their back line around their captain and Sweden international Granqvist is the strongest part of their team, which is also in tune about what a friend of mine, who follows the Russian league closely, warned me about before the match, calling their defense the second best in Russia behind St. Petersburg. They were very well organised and their pressing was honestly better coordinated and more intense than the one of most EPL sides. If you would put them in the lower half of either the Bundesliga or EPL they would not look out of place there and would be known as one of the more annoying teams to play against.

Just as his performance in the friendly against St. Pauli should not have been as hyped as it was here, we should not talk down this performance either. It was a tough game against a solid opponent, especially because we went down one goal pretty early and our poor creative axis caused our system to not run as smoothly as usual at least until Kagawa came on in HT and gave us more structure and urgency in the offense. Because of that Januzaj could not really profit from the usual service, but still did very well all things considered. He was part of some very nice combinations, had a few good maneuvers on the ball and was overall very active. He basically showed every strength I expected from him and the same can be said about his weaknesses. He held onto the ball for too long in a few situations and there were some scenes where his decision making got the better of him. His defensive contribution is also not on the standart of a Dortmund attacker, yet, which caused Tuchel to make him switch sides midgame and pair him up with the more experienced FB.

Overall, his time on the pitch with us so far was pretty much as I expected to be. If there were some minor surprises, it was besides the pitch. He found his place very quickly in the club, which is probably because Aubameyang instantly took him under his wing and is showing him the ropes in Dortmund. He is also seen laughing, smiling and joking around a lot on pictures. I always viewed him as very serious for a boy his age. This might just be my subjective impression, but maybe it is because the pressure with us is not as high as it was as academy prodigy (with all the hype coming with it) at United. If that pressure was a problem for him, a loan might just have been the right way to develop not only as footballer but also as person. I still think that we were not the ideal destination for him, though, and he should have gone to a club where he would have been a nailed down starter.

1044~~~
Exactly. It was a good, promising performance, which is pleasing. But he's played better games for United without a doubt. Multiple goals, multiple assists, skinning defenders left and right, beating multiple opponents on the dribble. I'm not seeing brilliance that he hasn't already shown at United - the difference, hopefully, is that he might get more game time at Dortmund, allowing the consistency of his game to come on, and letting him gain experience, build up physical strength and presence, learn what to do when etc etc.

1045~~~
Schmelzers game is all about short passing and hes great positionally as a left back. if his techniques isnt sharp and his ball control isnt great and doesnt offer much apart from a few crosses then what is he doing starting for dortmund? i think you are seriously undervaluing his attributes. if he didnt have a groin and knee injury he would have started for the german national side that won the world cup and youre saying he's sub par?! i cannot agree with that. 

i do think dortmund had a problem in central areas but that was not down to januzaj, it was because kagawa and weigl didnt start and castro did. i think the opposition tried to dominate every space the dortmund players occupied which wasnt helped by the fact that there were no quick exchanges between mikhitaryan kagawa and schmelzer as park and castro who started alongside gundogan and mikhi struggled to handle the pressing. moreover auba also had an off night (as you mentioned many players had an off night). once kagawa and later weigel came on and dominated the middle of the park the team improved and got even better when januzaj moved away from a central striker position

at this point i cant even remember where this disagreement even started but since this is now completely deviating from the topic its best we stop. as United supporter i hope he develops well and as an admirer of dortmund i hope he does well for them wherever he plays.

1046~~~
Right all the European teams are a joke compared to the EPL. That´s why they have to invite teams from Israel and Azerbaijan, so EPL teams win games at all. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1047~~~
Januzaj has potential, but as far as I am concerned by and large he has been pretty poor in a Manchester United shirt.
I am also fairly sure he played for Manchester United before LVG arrived on the scene.

1048~~~
There have been tons of reasons to choose Dortmund over all clubs bar the big 3 (Barca, Bayern, Madrid) in the past few years.

1049~~~
God forbid! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/><img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>


These are good points. I think Dortmund might be a healthier environment than United in general for young players around the first team levels. In most cases you're never going to find the one perfect loan club.

Also, the video seems to have been taken down, so here's another.

1050~~~
An impressive performance there in the Europe league. So far this loan move is turning out to be quite good for him. Hope we do not sell him and he is back here fresh and ready to claim a place next season.

1051~~~
Yes because that's exactly what I meant. I dont agree with the premier league is da bestest ever campaign but league games are definitely more intense and physical than group stage europa fecking league games. At least that one for sure.

1052~~~
I think it will be a great experience for him and he'll return a brand new player - significantly more experienced and confident than when he left.

1053~~~
If he can then we could potentially see Januzaj on the right wing with Memphis on the left and Martial up front in the long term.

1054~~~
BVB: Bürki, Ginter, Sokratis, Hummels, Schmelzer, Weigl, Gündogan, Hofmann, Kagawa, Mkhitaryan, Aubameyang <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bvbb04?src=hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#<b>bvbb04</b></a>

Januzaj dropped for Hofmann against Leverkusen. Reus is on the bench too, so there is a real chance Januzaj won't play at all today.

1055~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Reus on the bench?

1056~~~
Yes.

1057~~~
Cheers. Not very likely to come on then unless you are cruising it.

1058~~~
He got half an hour today. Didn't see the game though. Anyone see how he did?

<a class="username" data-user="70116, @Sphaero" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/70116/">@Sphaero</a>

1059~~~
Average. Could have been given a pen for us and took and wasted one really good opportunity where Kagawa had a way better shooting position. Nice and tidy on the ball like usual, but overall nothing really noteworthy.

1060~~~

1061~~~
I like how Shinji goes completely mad after he has that ball taken off his toes.

1062~~~
I've been seeing these compilations and I am most impressed by this one. IMO his main weakness is that he can be bullied off the ball, here, he was shielding intelligently and using his skill and balance to pass it on. Progress, IMO.

1063~~~
No, his main weakness was his terrible judgment. He would either lose the ball making a stupid attempt to beat 3 defenders or take terrible attempts on goal, breaking up what few attacks we were able to muster up. He was one of our worst outfield players everytime he has played for us in the last 2 seasons.

His pathetic clearance of a clear goal opportunity for Kagawa in that clip reminds me why he is on loan and not playing for us. Compare to other youngsters like Martial and Depay and how they have taken their positions by storm, and frankly, patience for Januzaj is running low.

1064~~~
I agree with the 1st 2 lines, I was quite critical of his decision-making too when I used to watch, I just felt that his lack of strength/balance was a bigger weakness.

The rest of the post is just rubbish though.
"frankly, patience for Januzaj is running low" For whom? You? Januzaj must be broken-hearted.
For LVG? He recently implied that he's part of the club's future.

1065~~~
He's getting more game time there than he would be with us. The decision to loan him out is justified already, I think. Whether Dortmund was the best destination remains to be seen. Would rather he'd gone to a weaker side where he'd play even more, tbh.

1066~~~
Patience running low in a 20 year old. Says it all really.

1067~~~
Absolutely

1068~~~
Nothing too impressive, Dortmund are probably one of the most in form teams at the moment with 11 wins from 11 matches and loads of goals scored. If Januzaj gets some starts and lengthy sub appearances, I'd expect him to be a bit productive and have some quality performances offensively. Hope that that will come in time, he has some nice glimpses during the matches of quality, but its still too much fart imo.

1069~~~
I disagree. Considering he's so young I think the confidence of playing in a good technical side, in a competitive league surrounded by experienced players is better than playing in a weaker side, where more pressure would have been on his shoulders to perform.
It's not just about minutes, being part of a team with a winning mentality, and playing with lots of experienced players is key too.

1070~~~
Is it though? How many talented players have really come out from established teams compared to smaller clubs? I think the level of the league certainly matters, but the quality of teammates / used to winning / mentorship factors are overrated. At that stage in a player's development, it really is all about the minutes.

1071~~~
Writing off a young player that hasnt played 30 games or isnt 23 years old is quite stupid anyways

1072~~~
It's subjective, and each player develops differently.
It's not like LVG has a bad track record developing youth talent.

So I trust the decision to send him to Dortmund, they play excellent football, and he'll be able to develop his technical skills. 
If he's as good as we all know he can be, then he should be able to break into that team - they promote youth prospects regularly. Nothing is going to be handed to him on a plate, like it would be if he was at a weaker team, he has to work hard to become a regular in that team and that's what he needs.

1073~~~
Agreed. Nobody can look bad in that team at the moment. Still think he overdribbles. He misses the moments to pass and should look for the options more often. But so did Gundogan almost the whole game. Januzaj definitely stole the clear scoring chance for Kagawa, but can´t blame him for that. Near impossible to watch the ball on the right and have eyes in your back to track your teammates run on the left. 
Don´t think he made any progress toward a starting role in those 30 minutes. Hofmann had a strong game and the fact that Tuchel picked Januzaj for Krasnodar and Hofmann yesterday suggests Januzaj is 5th on the offensive midfielder depth chart. He´ll get his starts for now, but only in the EL and maybe against some weaker BL teams.

1074~~~
I don't see how he can be criticized for taking the opportunity away from Kagawa. He was also running onto a clear chance and should have easily slotted it into the left side of the net. Criticize for getting underneath and completely fecking it up sure but he is running onto as clear a chance as Kagawa, and honestly I think the direction he is coming in is better for the chance than Kagawa.

1075~~~
I don't understand it either - he was closer to goal and the ball was coming to his stronger foot.  The finish was shite but surely no one thinks that ball should have been left for Kagawa.

1076~~~
Has anyone got a GIF of the bit of play? I haven't seen it..

1077~~~
<a class="username" data-user="43802, @dsch" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/43802/">@dsch</a> Thanks for posting the video.  

Looks like he is getting quality playing time.  He's taking corners and free kicks.  He's getting on the ball and not trying to do too much dribbling alone.  He pauses more intelligently than he did last season.  He waits for runners to shift the defense rather than allowing the defense to square up while he plans a dribble.  Basically, he's better plugged in with what's happening in that match than he was last season.

1078~~~
It's in the video posted on this page.

1079~~~
Oh, I can't take credit. <a class="username" data-user="77803, @JohnnyLaw" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/77803/">@JohnnyLaw</a> posted it.

1080~~~
My bad, <a class="username" data-user="77803, @JohnnyLaw" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/77803/">@JohnnyLaw</a> Thanks for the vid.

1081~~~
I think he's a Fergie type of player, give him free reign and he can do magic. Ask him to plug away at a boring formula, like with LVG, and he becomes average.

1082~~~
No problem mate.

1083~~~
I'm afraid so.  That may balance out a little as he matures, though.

1084~~~
He's magic.

1085~~~
All the highlights videos show his very good technique and ability but he has undoubtedly played against poor opposition. They're giving him plenty of time for the first touch/movement (which sets up everything else) compared to when he was playing with us, although it's most likely because he's finding more space dropping deeper and going wide as oppossed to that no.10/2nd striker business with LVG. 

I agree with the indecisive/poor judgement though. His skillset and style should see him play like Silva but he's differs between being a pass-first playmaker and/or a creative wide player. So instead of efficient touches and well calculated dribbles/spacial movement, he's neither here or there. It's something that he'll have to discover himself because I don't think Tuchel or LVG are going to sit him down and tell him what to do and how to play, which can also fully maximise his potential.

1086~~~
That's definitely noticeable in the St Pauli and to some extent the Krasnodar videos, but I'm seeing no evidence of it against Hannover or Leverkusen. Particularly in the latter, he's having to work very hard to find any space at all, and is almost exclusively getting the ball with an opponent already up against his back.

The two Bundesliga videos look pretty close to what he's experienced and can expect in a lot of PL matches.

1087~~~
I really do wonder how people can come to that conclusion. Krasnodar was up to this point Januzaj´s hardest game. First of all because they are actually a very devensively solid side. They were better organised than any English team in the EL so far and even the idea of putting them behind the defensive mess that is Hanover this season is quite frankly insulting towards the Russians. Secondly the circumstances were far worse than in the other games (falling behind early and weaker performing support cast).

Leverkusen was on paper the best side we faced so far, but when he came in the game we were already up 2:0, which caused Leverkusen to become desperate and open up spaces. Hell they did not even play with a defensive midfield in the second half, which is near suicide vs our team. On top of that they were in a clear disadvantage in terms of stamina because of their exhausting pressing in the first 70 minutes.

Honestly, it is like people read EL Group match and a lesser known foreign team and just assume they are cannon fodder.

1088~~~
Why does he still fall so easily? I thought he has gotten considerably stronger on the ball?

1089~~~
This is just strange considering Januzaj had one of the more impressive starts to his United career as an 18 year old. The October that he had against Sunderland, Southampton, Norwich, etc... were something that Martial didn't even do, goals aside. And one of our worst outfield players every time in the last 2 seasons? No where near true with Moyes. It was only last season that he had a really bad season in very few minutes btw.

1090~~~
This is all hypothetical but what if he didn't come back a better player after being loaned out to a weaker side? Januzaj's main weaknesses are his dribbling and decision making, both of which make him an isolated figure and it doesn't look good, but I feel a weaker side would rely far too heavily on his individual brilliance and I doubt he would make that much of an improvement . Which <i>almost</i> makes a loan move redundant in that regard. At Borussia Dortmund, he has to rely less on his dribbling and make decisions quickly and he's playing under Tuchel, who prefers a good mixture of possession-based and counter-attacking football. Which benefits both parties more IMO.

1091~~~
That's an interesting idea. I do think if the league level was still high (like the Bundesliga) then it wouldn't be that much of an issue, unless you mean specifically for playing under LVG. If he can be good enough for a weaker side to be happy to rely on him to be their match-winner week in week out, I think that would be a significant step up already. 

If he gets regular game-time at Dortmund and can really learn all those things in the space of a single year, I will be delighted.

1092~~~
I don´t get this. How would there be less emphasis on his decision making in a smaller side? I would argue the exact opposite. If he would be a constant starter or even key player of a team, his decision making would have a way bigger impact on the game flow. The pressure to make the right decisions would be way more severe, because he would be expected to run the game. Unless we play a complete B side, this will never happen at Dortmund. To be completely honest, him having a poor performance will normally have a way smaller impact on the overall game than if it happens to the likes of Hummels, Gündogan, Reus or Kagawa. These are the guys, who are expected to carry the game and keep the machine running. In any normal formation Januzaj will always have more accomplished and proven players next to him. The worst he can do is waste a few chances, break down a few attacking plays and lose the ball. If this continues for half an hour he will be either subbed or go missing on the field, because the key players will then play around that. There will be never a true reliance on him. He is there to add something different to our overall game and be part of our combination play, nothing more.

This of course does not mean, that he might not improve in this area by playing for us in training and matches, This has less to do with our standing, but more with our style, though. The biggest pressure for him to improve in this regard is not that he would otherwise hurt our play too badly, but that he simply would not play for us at all. The problem in this case is, that to really improve decision making you need to get consistent game time, because nothing can replace that completely, not even the most efficient training.

1093~~~
Is on the bench again for the game vs. Hoffenheim (starts in about 40 minutes).

Could only be 2nd offensive option (depending on the game situation) as Hofmann starts for Mkhitaryan, who gets a bit of rest and is on the bench.

1094~~~
People keep saying it but how is he getting anymore gametime at Dortmund than he would have at United ?

1095~~~
Well, he won´t unless he profits from injuries. If this is about his development, it is more about a change in environment than actual game time.

1096~~~
That's fair. You could see the problems Januzaj had under LvG: struggled physically, was far too much of a dribbler with little end product, decision making was poor, and he probably didn't follow instructions. I didn't think he did too badly this season but obviously LvG thought different.

When I refer to weaker side, I'm also trying to reference Moyes' Manchester United. While Januzaj was undoubtedly very good in that season, the type of pressure he had to deal with meant that he had to do everything himself which led to very poor decisions, but he's a youngster and is expected to learn, so being overcritical would be harsh. However, if you were to put him in a weaker side than Borussia Dortmund, then I feel his habits would be prevalent in his play and he wouldn't gain much in that regard. Of course his decision making would probably improve, but everything is almost set up perfectly for him at Dortmund. There's more pressure on him to improve various aspects of his play and I personally think that's better for his development, regardless of playing time.

1097~~~
Unused sub today ?

Strange as Dortmund were chasing the winner.

1098~~~
The tough period starts for him. With Reus back, there quite a few ahead of him in the pecking order. Reus, Hoffman, mikhta, Kagawa
I can think of at least these four. Out of these four, I can only see three starting in a match, making our boy Adnan the second choice sub.
I still hope he starts 15-20 games for them this season. Looks difficult though, unless he replaces one of those four due to his performances :-)

1099~~~
Based on Tuchel's comments on Adnan so far, I reckon that the main difference between Hofmann and him at this point in time is experience with our brand of football, i.e. the intensity, positional play, defensive work. That's something Adnan should be able to learn quickly and work himself up in the pecking order above Hofmann. Tuchel won't let him start in matches in which he would consider him a potential defensive liability.
Generally, I suspect Tuchel will give Adnan more game time against teams sitting back with a compact defense.

The pre-match presser is tomorrow where Tuchel may give us some clues if he considers starting Adnan against Darmstadt on Sunday.

1100~~~
Interesting. Thanks for the insight. 
But even if Adnan does make it over Hoffman, I don't see him starting over reus, shinji and mikhtariyan. That's not too bad though, as Dortmund have many games due to Europa

1101~~~
Even if Reus, Kagawa and Mkhitaryan won't suffer injuries, they'd need a rest from time to time. Therefore, I'm confident Adnan will get a decent amount of game time <b>if</b> he adapts to Tuchel's demands. If I had to guess, I'd say AJ gets subbed on against Darmstadt and starts next Thursday in the Europa League. Against Bayern though, he'll be back on the bench.

I have to correct myself on the timing of the pre-match presser: It's actually today (one day earlier than usual).

1102~~~
I like this loan, it will confirm some of LVG's areas of improvement, sometimes younger players can benefit from a second opinion.

1103~~~
Nothing too insightful on Adnan in today's presser: Tuchel stated he's an option, also over the course of 90 minutes and that it was a close call against Hoffenheim.

1104~~~
The bold is true, but I would not say with such certainty that just learning our system will put him above Hofmann, though.

The comparision of Januzaj and Hofmann is actually a pretty interesting one. 

At first glance Jonas Hofmann is a player, whom many would describe as decent first league player, mostly suitable for a midtable Bundesliga club. He is a jack of all trades kind of players, who does not excell at any specific aspect of the game, but has also not a glaring weakness either. Passing, crossing, shooting, tackling, pace, etc. all on a decent level, but mostly way below the skills of our starters or the naturally way more gifted Januzaj.

So how does a player like him manage to score 4 goals and assist 14 (!) in the space of around 1.500 minutes for a club like Borussia Dortmund? By having extremely good decision making. In a time where teams frequently play overcomplicated football and try to be spectacular Hofmann impacts in a very straightforward and simple manner. Nothing he does looks extraordinary, but most of the time the simple things he does are the right actions. This makes him crazy efficient. 

Now, Januzaj is in contrast someone, who is at least two drawers above Hofmann in terms of raw talent. You put them next to each other in training and say: "The Belgian kid obviously plays". Problem is, that Hofmann´s biggest strength is Januzaj´s most glaring weakness. Most of the things Adnan does look great and promising but ultimatively lack end product and go nowhere. You have one player, where strong decision making maximizes his limited abilities while the other one´s undeniably high skills are held back by the lack of it. 

In the long run unless something goes terribly wrong (injuries, attitude) Januzaj will turn out to be the better player, because he will improve enough in that regard with time and experience that his raw abilities will give him the edge, but like I said several times on here already, the long run is not important in this loan deal. All that counts is the present performances, so Januzaj has to improve quickly or he won´t go ahead of Hofmann in the internal ranking.

1105~~~
I fully second your point that Januzaj's decision making is his main weakness.

However: In the first place, I wasn't stating <i>my</i> opinion on Januzaj or Hofmann but what I make of <i>Tuchel's comments</i> on the two since Januzaj arrived, and I haven't referred to long-term prospects of the two players beyond this season.
Although I admit that I don't see in Hofmann what you see. First of all, I'm not too impressed by his decision making either (for example, I recall numerous situations in which he went into senseless dribblings which he lost). Secondly, IMHO four goals in 1.500 minutes aren't too impressive for an attacking midfielder. Okay, he scored the opener against Leverkusen but he also scored the 3rd goal in Munich in spring 2014 against a - at that time - rather toothless Bayern (they had walked the league before and were two goals down in that game).

Assists are nice stats but they contain a huge element of luck: The passing player has next to zero influence if a team mate scores or not. Henrikh Mkhitaryan is a prime example for this fact: In season 14/15 Micky would have already had a close to two-digit number of assists in the first half of the season if Auba, Reus etc had scored his key passes as they did in the second half. Likewise, Reus and Auba would have had a much higher number of assists if Micky had converted a fraction of their key passes. Therefore, assists don't rank too high in my books.

Generally, I find it more difficult to judge upon (attacking) players who mainly get subbed on rather playing from the start, which is the case for Hofmann during his tenure(s) with us. Defenders can be tired, or the opponent opening up at the end to equalize or score the winning goal, making it potentially easier to pass and shoot.

Back to Januzaj. Even<i> if</i> he adapts quickly to our game, I don't think Tuchel will consider him as a natural starter unless Kagawa, Reus, Micky or Auba are injured, have a serious and continuous dip in form, or need a rest; but it is apparent to me that Tuchel appreciates him and his abilities enough to see him already after such a short period of time much closer to Hofmann than I would have expected.

1106~~~
It's really strange because one of the main reasons why I thought Januzaj was a sure thing during his youth days was due to his decision making compared to every young player I watched. He didn't make it a priority to dribble past players, he passed, and was patient. He changed during the Moyes' year.

1107~~~
What comments about Hofmann? Did I miss something? I don´t recall Tuchel ever saying something specific about him. He usually does not single out (both positively nor negatively) players in statements unless he is asked about them. All comments on Januzaj so far come from anwers to specific questions from the press conferences. Nodody really asked about Hofmann so far, so neither you nor I know Tuchel´s real evaluation of Jonas Hofmann.

All we know is that Tuchel rated Hofmann high enough to keep him in difference to several other offensive player, which were let go. He also played him for around 400 minutes already, which is nearly as much as Castro and Ramos put together (both also options for the wing) and let him start in roughly half the games so far.  

I disagree, I don´t think he really often goes in senseless dribblings. Senseless would implicate that there were way better options at hand (and a back pass to rotate the ball through the CM is not a better option most of the time). I won´t deny that he has lost possessions with failed dribblings, but this is more about execution than the thought process behind it. We play heavy defense lines most of the time, so the wide players have to take some small risks from time to time and try to create space. 

I do agree, that he is not a big goal scorer, though.  

So you dismiss Hofmann´s most impressive stat by stating that it is reliant on team mates (which is true, but so is scored goals) and then spend a paragraph describing how other Dortmund players should have <i>more </i>assists already, if the chance conversion would be better? The only reason why Hofmann´s number of assists should be seen as less impressive is if it would be inflated by a very strong forward line in terms of finishing. That´s obviously not the case here because both under Klopp and Tuchel chance conversion is far from perfect, some would even call it a weakness. If anything, Hofmann´s number of assists would be deflated and clearly show that he can create very good chances for his team mates to convert. 

I agree with that. Hofmann is for me also more valuable as impact sub than as starter. If he would have the same output as starter as he has as mainly sub he would be around the level of Reus in top shape in terms of scoring ability, though, and we would not discuss if he would be the first rotation and bench option but rather where he plays in the starting line up.  

Again, we don´t know that. All Tuchel has said, is that Januzaj is a definite option both as starter or as sub. This is a statement as open as it gets. It tells us nothing we don´t already know, because he played in both ways already. That´s the kind of answer of someone who does not want to rule anything out. I don´t think Januzaj will play tomorrow, as we will probably play with the best possible formation and then rotate in Greece for the EL.

1108~~~
Tuchel did comment on Hofmann versus Januzaj, thereby making statements about him, not just this Friday.



Let's agree to diasagree on his point then.

My point is that assists are <i>generally</i> largely influenced by luck, more so than scoring, because the passing player is totally reliant on the receiving team mate if he grabs an assist or not. I took Micky as an example to show that this huge luck component applies regardless who's assisting.

Another reason why I don't rate assists that high is that the most crucial, creative passes leading to a goal are often the second, third or fourth goal assists, often done by Hummels, Gündogan, Kagawa, Mkhitaryan, Reus (or Lewandowski in 13/14 when Hofmann had his first regular Bundesliga minutes).

Again, assists are nice to look at but nothing which I rate as much as you apparently do, and in Hofmann's particular case, as a sub he played mainly against either tired defenders / less compact defense lines, his assist tallies are IMO even less impressive as if he had those as a starter.

For the first part, see above. I for my part am surprised about Tuchel's comments, and expect Januzaj to require quite some time to adapt. On his chances starting today: I don't think so but can totally see him to be subbed on.

PS: Would you share which website you're consulting when you refer to 14 assists? I can't come up with 14, sorry. Do these 14 include Hofmann's (sometime questionable) draws of penalties? Thanks.

Getting a bit too friendly with Reus I see.

1113~~~
Wonder if Adnan took him to Nandos...

1114~~~
loan with happy ending.

1115~~~
Nah, looks more as if agents MR11 and PEA17 are on a successful "why don't you stay just a little bit longer" mission ... <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

PS: Adnan on the bench BTW.

1116~~~
That's Reus's hand on his crotch. When you realise that, this becomes very creepy to watch.

1117~~~
Hofmannisnt in the squad so I expect him to get some minutes.

1118~~~
So many things wrong with that photo. Why does Reus have a weird shaped left hand too? Almost looks like he has two hands in one sleeve.

1119~~~
This ends in Adnan pointing to the doll telling the police man where he was touched...

1120~~~
Adnan getting gang banged

1121~~~
Come on for Dortmund for last half hour by the way, on BT Sport if you fancy watching.

1122~~~
Always maintained this guy is a potential worldie. The biggest talent we have right now.

That assist was sexy.

1123~~~
Lovely turn and pass to bag an assist.

1124~~~
2-1 Januzaj with the assist

1125~~~
Good assist by him

1126~~~
Great assist by Januzaj.

1127~~~
fecking hell Gundagon with that turn.

1128~~~
Beautiful cross field pass.

1129~~~
Beautiful turn and a nice pass to Aubameyang. That's his first assist of the season. More importantly, I think he changed the game when he came on. Good performance.

1130~~~
On for Marco Reus too..with Dortmund losing..great show of faith by the manager.

1131~~~
Real quick thinking when he gave Auba the ball.

1132~~~
He wasn't fully fit.

1133~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/uzip" width="560"></iframe>

1134~~~
He's overrated by the way and won't ever be good enough for us...

<span style="color: #ffffff">...according to some experts here</span>

1135~~~
One of them was arguing with me that during his time at United he's shown nothing to suggest he even has the potential...

1136~~~
Hopefully this will cement him as first rotation ahead of Hoffman.

1137~~~
One assist? Seems unlikely. But he'll get plenty of minutes there I think as Tuchel seems like he is rotating a decent amount. He suits Dortmunds play a lot more then Van Gaal's anyway, or at least currently.

1138~~~
Be pretty annoying if he doesn't want to leave there...

Not that I'm saying he will or anything, I'm just letting my mindless worries loose on the caf.

1139~~~
He scored a goal previously as well but what I meant was tuchel trusting him in a tough situation and him delivering. Performances like that tend to stick in the mind.

1140~~~
Take them back and go away.<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

1141~~~
Think he's the natural alternative to Mata out on the right. Thing he'll be better like Silva, cuttting in from the wing to pass and drifting inside.

1142~~~
The way Dortmund play under Tuchel isn't too different from they way we play under LVG.

1143~~~
It's Rooney I hope he replaces.

1144~~~
ill spin it another way...the first replacement for the best player in the team and one of the best talents in world football.

1145~~~
For the local Dortmund fans: So how did he do aside from the assist? Thoughts on his position within the Dortmund squad, if it changed at all?

1146~~~
I can't tell, does he chip it over that defender's outstretched leg, or does it deflect up and over? Difference between a tidy assist and a very clever one indeed.

Not that I'm obsessive or anything.

Agreed. And the fact that he's also capable of dribbling to the byline and crossing/skinning his man like a winger is what will make him really dangerous there. So hard to defend against those rare players who can do both things.

And that way Mata/Herrera/Pereira can play in the hole when we eventually drop Rooney (see how I've put players of three different ages in there, to cover for Rooney's inevitable clinging-to-power).

1147~~~
Good to see him get an assisst today and he showed some decent strength on the ball as well.

Someone get Olivia Benson on the phone! We sent him over there to further his football education, not to get his bratwurst fondled. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>.......Unless this is part of the Gundogan negotiations, in which case carry on, nothing but a harmless jape to see here. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1148~~~
Hopefully he comes back

1150~~~
They look a hell of a lot more fluid and cohesive going forward than we do, though. The best stuff they played today was really great. They just didn't do it for long enough and more importantly, defended that final set piece like Arsenal on a particularly idiotic day.

1151~~~
Does he have a relatively free role at Dortmund? Seems to get into positions left right and center.

1152~~~
That's a great assist, perfect number 10 play.

1153~~~
Isn't that the same criticism we are getting though? When we turn on we are virtually unplayable, it just comes too irregularly. Dortmund were playing against a team that were sitting back and hitting on the counter, they looked as toothless as we have at times this season in the first half.

1154~~~
Got a big nick off the defender's leg but you can see that he deliberately dinked the pass, to make it harder to cut out, so the deflection was earned!

1155~~~

You know what to do Adnan...

1156~~~
Operation Bratwurst is going as planned. Now get him on that chopper Adnan.

1157~~~
Dortmund's three AMs all have relatively free roles. Kagawa usually sticks to the center, drifts to the left half space or drops deeper since that's what suits him the best, Mkhitaryan is basically starting on the left but generally drifting around freely in order to create links/triangles and the right AM (Reus) is often literally all over the pitch since a lot of Dortmund's build up happens on the left side and he's looking to provide options there.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://spielverlagerung.com/2015/09/15/team-analysis-tuchels-borussia-dortmund/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://spielverlagerung.com/2015/09/15/team-analysis-tuchels-borussia-dortmund/</a>

Here is some nerdy, well written, wall of text about it if anyone is interested.

1158~~~
A couple of BVB players stay in Dortmund, among them Auba (infection) and Shinji (time to rest). Therefore, I fully expect Adnan to play from the start tomorrow.

1159~~~
Adnandos

1160~~~

1161~~~
No way is he the replacement for mata.  Thats absolutely bullsh*t mind my language. 

Sometimes i wonder if im watching the same team as some of you.  Why would januzaj play as a striker or AM and shift mata on the right?

1162~~~
I did not realise what i said

1163~~~
Christ, looks like we're only getting Adnan back if Reus comes with him.

1164~~~
Don't know about Mata but he's twice the player centrally than on the wings. 

Also, I fear he's having a good time there.... he wont wanna come back? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1165~~~
just reached home and saw that adnan is starting today. bvb losing at PAOK 60 mins gone.
just started watching.
anyone following the match? how is adnan doing?

1166~~~
I can live with that.

1167~~~
Looks like he's on the right. Oh, he's just been subbed, 84'.

1168~~~

1169~~~
Cheers, thought that might be it. Clever ball.

How did he play tonight folks?

1170~~~
He was decent and was involved in a couple of dangerous chances for Dortmund. He was a bit more reserved with his dribbling and had a couple of really good passes I'm sure. Not a star performance, but still a good one. You could tell he was tired toward the end of the second half. He was on the left, but then switched centrally.

1171~~~
Any highlights from tonight?

1172~~~
That's ma boy!

I'm a minute into that video and Januzaj has been off the edge of the image 95% of the time. Bit pointless.

1175~~~
half decent vid

1176~~~
Bit rough round the edges.

1177~~~
You guys think there's any chance he'll be involved in der Klassiker?

1178~~~
Possibly as a sub.

1179~~~
I think he's behind in terms of tactics, so I don't think he will feature unless Dortmund are behind or clearly winning.

1180~~~
Would have be nice to see him and Periera on the bench today.

1181~~~

1182~~~
Bit late but here's a better video without Januzaj cropped out!
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I1KPM90exDA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1183~~~
Came on about 10 minutes into the second half.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hged6FVt_OI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1184~~~
Played from the right when he came on and had a couple of decent runs, Dortmund were really on the back foot by then though.

1185~~~
Yeah if you look at his performance in a vacuum than it doesn't look as good as it was in the context of the match. He looked the liveliest when he came on at 4-1. He still has to learn how to press like Dortmund want him to and also get used to their quick passing game.

1186~~~
Not a great performance IMO. Very static lot of times. So many times needed more than a couple of touches to get the ball under control. Didn't really have any great passes or great dribbles either. Good set piece deliveries though. That's about it.

1187~~~
Yeah, but his pass to Reus in the first half was really good.

1188~~~
Good to see him getting on the pitch.

1189~~~
I still don't understand why he's there? I mean, it's great for him and us, but what's in it for Dortmund? Do they not have enough talented youngsters, and could they not buy young German prospects and give they game time instead, to benefit from it later on? Unless they are planning to buy him from us, there doesn't seem to be much in it for them?

1190~~~
Well it was a last minute deal after they sold some of their squad players, so maybe Dortmund loaned Januzaj because they wanted to postpone the issue instead of spending a lot of money on a suboptimal solution. They seem to have a talented bunch of youngsters coming through, Passlack especially is getting a lot of media recognition already, but I believe most of them aren't even 18 years old yet, so they probably needed a short term solution who could perform right away while they ease their own youngsters into professional football.

1191~~~
Unused sub against Mainz today.

1192~~~
Should have been starting for us this weekend instead.

1193~~~
Mate, if he's unused against mainz he won't be starting against Everton who will get stuck into any weak link.

I want the lad to make it but he needs another year or two imo

1194~~~

1195~~~
People seriously are not expecting him to be subbed on every game right?

1196~~~
That's to be expected. The move was almost always going to be a move from our bench to theirs. The season is still very young, he may break his way into their first team at some point.

1197~~~
Wouldn't expect that TBH but his minutes in the Europa League are better: 174 minutes out of 180.

1198~~~
Would I be wrong to assume he would be starting games if any one of the three (in a 4231) were to be out injured or suspended?

1199~~~
he would be getting gametime here as well, look how poor memphis plays, Adnan would get chances to play form the flank once again, Van Gaal only tried him behind the striekr and as a striker.. anyway hope he does well there, the change of climate will help to be stronger and he will grow as a man I guess when he comes back. Also no negative environment in terms of Van Gaal's possession tactics

1200~~~
If he's not starting for Dortmund, why should he be starting for us?

1201~~~
Reus, Micky, and Kagawa have all been better than Memphis, Mata and Rooney.

1202~~~
Hofmann seems to be starting before him (in Bundesliga matches).

1203~~~
If I use Kagawa as baseline of premiership performance, then they aren't doing much.

1204~~~
It's all going as expected. He's getting his minutes in the EL where Dortmund are resting players but he's 5th in the picking order for the three positions he can play in the league.
So far one can't really say if this deal pays off for any of the parties involved.

1205~~~
Only on the bench today. Hofmann replaces Mkhitaryan, who didn't travel to Qabala because of the political problems between Azerbaijan and Armenia at the moment. No rotation otherwise. Auba, Reus and Kagawa all start.

1206~~~
Hope he can show Hofmann to the bench, if not then this loan will be very negative for him.

1207~~~
No it won't. Even if he doesn't displace Hofmann, he will still get games playing in a cohesive attacking unit that suits his style to the ground. Also, the experience he is getting from training with another team and another manager will improve him more then at United

1208~~~
Is the Dortmund game on BT Sport Extra?

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ula5xLIXnzc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Only had 15 mins to impress, but he did really well. Would have preferred him as an option coming off the bench for us though.

1211~~~
ugh, i miss januzaj when he was just "on" with us in his first year. granted these highlights were against lowly competition, we could really do with that nowadays. especially since LVG is complaining about his players "red lining" in terms of being exhausted from all the games.

granted LVG could also be utilising pereira a lot more too.

1212~~~
I don't miss him at all - he was pretty average for us for the last year. What I hope happens is that he finds his confidence and his game and comes back to us reborn.

What I suspect will happen is that it will be quite obvious that he is better suited to the German game and that he'll move to Dortmund permanently. We may get Reus out of it which would make it fine, but I doubt he will come to us and play in Van Gaal's system.

1213~~~
Such a strange loan move. I was fine with loaning him out but not to go to somewhere where he is used off the bench. so strange.

1214~~~
I really hope he starts today.

1215~~~
I expect him to start today, but I think it's quite telling that he didn't start in one of the last 2 games despite Mkhitaryan missing both. In the EL Hofmann got to start and in the league Castro played for Mkhitaryan. Januzaj is still far away from being first choice back-up to the regular attackers in important games. Today against a lower league team in the cup, it's likely that Tuchel will rotate a bit more.

1216~~~
He isn't starting <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1217~~~
Him not starting with both Reus and Aubameyang rotated out, seems a bit telling - especially since it's a home game against a second division side. I don't really know what to make of it since when he eventually was allowed to played he always seemed pretty decent to me, with a couple of genuinely great moments even. It's also a bit odd that he's been getting less game time and not more in the past few weeks.

1218~~~
BVB are starting with more or less their starting 11, Hoffman and Januzaj are both on the bench, its not as if 1 attacker is being preferred to the other. Miki is back and Abu rested for Ramos is hardly something to worry about.

1219~~~
sad thing is i completely forgot about him over the last month or so...how many games in total has he played for BVB now?  doesn't look good though when you ship a player out of loan and he doesn't play.  Perhaps PSV or another dutch team would have been better for him, specially with him being Belgian the Dutch speaking would have helped him settle in rather than in a league where he doesn't speak the language

1220~~~
It was annoying at the time it happened, but with how little gametime he's receiving is just making it ridiculous. Such a pointless idea.

1221~~~
it did baffle me that is was to BVB.  It's not like they're some middle of the league type team but one going for the title and CL. The whole idea for loans is to get experience in the first team and play regular competitive football.  He could have been sitting on the bench for us and playing in the Carling cup tonight in that case.

1222~~~
Hofmann played a full game last week though. Januzaj hasn't in 4 weeks now. At the moment it looks as if Ramos is the back-up for Auba upfront, Castro and Hofmann first and second choice back-ups for Reus, Kagawa, Mhkitaryan.

A months ago it looked as if Januzaj was an impact sub who was rotated in the starting line-up for less important games. Since the international break, it looks as if he's way down the pecking order and gets a few rather meaningless minutes at the end of games that are already decided. It's certainly a worrying development.

1223~~~
I wish I could know what went on behind the scenes for this loan, absolutely shit stuff from the club once again with regards to loans especially at a time when our own squad is a couple of injuries away from being paper thin. I think my feeling was that the management don't think that he has a future at the club and this loan is just proving that right.

1224~~~
Januzaj's problem is currently two folded. The first one is Castro who has so far shown good and his by far best performances in the offensive midfield and given that his intrgration takes priority Adnan has even more competition as originally predicted. The second one might be even more worrying: According to people who are pretty close to the club Tuchel is appearantly not happy with Januzaj's training performances. Here it is not about effort but his lacking understanding of the tactical system. This would explain his lack of game time in the last few weeks.

1225~~~
Castro scores....

1226~~~
Januzaj is doomed

1227~~~
Unless he starts really ripping it up, Dortmund have little to no incentive to be patient with him.

Infact i said from the start of this loan, that he had less competition and more chances at game time at United.

If we had to loan him, surely there would have been tons of better clubs. Strangest one this.

1228~~~
He is coming on for Kagawa who scored a brace.

1229~~~
I can totally believe this. One of his major problems has always been his bad decision making at times. I thought that being away from the pressure of United he might have the chance to improve this.  He really needs to knuckle down and get himself together and learn all he can.

Shame, SAF retired, maybe he would have been best in a system that doesn't require too much 'thinking'...? I dunno, but I'm hoping he recognises he needs to work very very hard to address any issue he has with his overall game.

1230~~~
Hope he does well...

1231~~~
Unfortunately for Januzaj Dortmund have taken the foot of the gas pedal now.

1232~~~
The problem in his case is that he normally needs a club which has patience with him until he actually can learn the system completely. As long as we don't have the perspective to keep him longer there is no reason for us to show said patience with him, as there are enough alternatives to him.

1233~~~
Done pretty well since coming on today, though game was over by then anyway.

1234~~~
7:1 everyone but Januzaj scoring now. This is worrying.


<span style="color: #ffffff">White text</span>

1235~~~
How is that worrying? He had a good 30 minutes.


Welp, just saw the white "white text" text.

1236~~~
That loan doesn't make any sense for me. If he doesn't start in a cup match at home against a second league team when is he actually supposed to get his minutes? It's not like he's starting in the EL. It seems he is 6th choice right now for the 3 positions he can play - that's basically the opposite you'd want for a young player who goes on loan.

Meanwhile Lingard, Pereira and Wilson are all starting in Uniteds Cup tie. I didn't get the idea behind that loan spell on transfer deadline day and I'm still not getting it.

1237~~~
Not to mention we could have done with him here, but I guess maybe he needed another environment for a bit

1238~~~
Maybe it's more about developing his personality a bit more? New environment, out of his comfort zone, still fighting for a place. Might be they felt he needed to mature a bit and thought this would help?

1239~~~
He's better than Memphis right now, imo.

1240~~~
Never understood this loan move and can see it being another wasted year in his career. He's found himself in a very similar place in the pecking order as he would have been here except Dortmund will be even less inclined to start him as they will give preference to their own players. He should have been kept as competition to Memphis. This loan move doesn't help anyone.

1241~~~
That's been alluded to a number of times. By Andy Mitten, amongst others.

1242~~~
Which still does not explain why United would send him to us of all places. Fighting for a place is nice and all but it should at least be a fight where he does have a realistic shot. The chance that he would outperform one of our starters to such an extend that he would overcome the massive gulf in internal standing was nearly nonexistent from the start. It is also not like that we played the same offensive every game either. We have been very careful with our key players especially Reus and rested them often. Januzaj was still not close to the starting formation. A loan move in itself was certainly not the worst move but the destination was highly risky and now we have the expected outcome, although even I thought he would get more minutes than he did.

Given that nothing is more important for such a young player than consistent game time, this move so far only helped Dortmund and nobody else.

1243~~~
how'd he do yesterday?

1244~~~
Januzaj if around to play against Middlesbro, would have opened up their defence from the wing.
Januzaj, Martial and Lingard would have better chance than Depay and Rooney.
Both Rooney and Depay were quite static  and did not find spaces when United had possession of the ball.

1247~~~
Aubameyang as well.

Shots fired

1251~~~
Januzaj and Weigl <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1252~~~
Apparently he's only played 139 minutes in 5 appearances for Dortmund... Should never have gone out on loan, at least not somewhere that has better wing options then united does. 
Any hope his loan gets cut short in January?

1253~~~
That's only his 5 sub appearances in the league. He started twice in EL games and was subbed on in a cup game. Overall it's still not a lot though. Out of 6 starts this season, 4 were still for United.

1254~~~
What I'll never understand is that he was one of our most featured players at start of the season then all of a sudden he goes on a loan. And we don't bring any winger after that.

1255~~~
To be fair, he popped up at the right time. A time where the spirits were low to say the least, the results were underwhelming and there he was, the young prospect scoring goals and bringing that much needed positivity in a time of doom and gloom.

1256~~~
I mean this season.

1257~~~
Can either party terminate the loan? There is absolutely no reason for him to stay beyond January if he'll not feature.

1258~~~
By themselves? Nope. If all parties agree on it, then I don´t see a reason why it should not be possible, though. For that to happen one of our initial permanent solutions (e.g. Yarmolenko) would have to become available, though. Unless we sign someone new there is no chance we agree on terminating it. The boy costs us nearly nothing and as squad player for desperate times (two or more longtime injuries in the offense) he is sitll good enough. It is also not like Tuchel denies him minutes on purpose right now, though. He is simply nowehere near the level of the starters and even the first rotation option (Castro) at the moment.

1259~~~
Just reckon LvG wasn't sure so gave him a go, he didn't perform up to standard so a loan was the best bet, people can say what they want about LvG but he is certainly brave with the youngsters, and gives them a fair chance.

I think it's a simialr situation with Lingard right now, if he take his chance then he'll stay and play, if he doesn't then he'll likely be sold or loaned again.

1260~~~
Lingard's done ok but Januzaj is a better player and a bigger prospect. It's a bit fecked seeing Lingard getting games for us while Januzaj is sitting on Dortmunds bench

1261~~~
Lingard fits the system better and his decision making is far better *usually*. It's that simple.

1262~~~
I disagree on both counts.

1263~~~
Bigger prospect but if he doesn't fit the tactical plans then talent can only get you so far. And if you'd watched Lingard at youth level you'd probably think he has better decision making than Januzaj, and rightfully so.

1264~~~
Januzaj had his chance, it's Lingard's turn now.

1265~~~
I don't think it's that simple.  Januzaj showed so much more at 18 than Lingard that it's easy to say he's a better player and a bigger prospect.  But it's far from uncommon for players to develop on different trajectories, and frankly Januzaj has gone backwards in recent times (to the point where he can't get a game for Dortmund), while Lingard has gradually progressed into potentially (not played nearly enough to judge yet) a quality player.

I think there's a fair case to say that right now Lingard may be the better player, and any assumptions we've had that Januzaj "just will" become the better player are actually based on very flimsy evidence.

1266~~~
I've watched Lingard since he was 15/16. I know his game inside out. I've always like him as a player and felt he could make it in the PL when most doubted him due to his size. Januzaj has much more to offer though.

1267~~~
Based on a couple of decent performances under little pressure? I like Lingard and have I've always rated him a bit higher than most people  but I don't see him as a long term prospect at United. It will become apparent when people get a larger sample of games to judge him by. He will be a good player but not a great one. Januzaj on the other hand has the talent to become a brilliant player if given the correct guidance.

1268~~~
Januzaj has showed nothing for 1.5 year now, he"s got his chances but hasnt taken them. The more 'talented' players dont mecessarily turn out to be the 'better' player.

1269~~~
We don´t see them on the training grounds, but based on game time I don´t consider less than 1.000 minutes in all senior competitions in the last season as much of a chance. He had two small runs of fixtures but was otherwise frozen out of the team. That is not even a slight against LvG or United as top teams don´t have much time and opportunities to develop talents themselves. That is why the loan system exists. A loan deal in itself definitively had merits in Januzaj´s case, but the destination was poorly chosen, as you normally send your youngsters in less competitive teams to get game time, not ones which are actually stronger in the relevant positions.

1270~~~
He was genuinely awful when given a run, he just didnt take his chances. Ofcoursenif the manager gives you 2 chances and you play just under the standard, your minutes will be limited, he has a goal to achieve as well. Januzaj is always fun to watch and all, but his end product is just non-existent, 0 goals and 1 assist under LVG.Bar the friendlies at Dortmund I dint think he has taken part of the high productivity from other players like Reus, Aubameyang, Miki but even Hoffmann, Castro are doing better tgan him as well. He's a gifted kid, but I dont understand all the talk about LvG not given him chances, or him getting the chances other playing has getting.

1271~~~
He actually has done quite well when he featured for Dortmund.You simply couldn't do too much with the limited time he had.People are just lack of patience again.Januzaj is an immense talent who is taking time to learn how to use it properly in top flight football.What he already had are those you can't teach.

1272~~~
I think the Dortmund experience will teach him what it takes to break into a top team. Till now he had only been competing at United and there could have been a thought in his mind that maybe he is good but not getting the chances because the Manager likes other players better or has a different style to what he brings.

If he has a good personality, he will learn from this experience and then try to impress in training and all the substitute chances he gets to put pressure on the starting 11.

1273~~~
We should think about bringing him back when the winter break starts in Germany unless BVB are unfortunate enough to suffer a couple of long term injuries in attack. All this "building character in a different country" shit is nonsense. The guy is not English, he came from Belgium at a young age and made it to the Manchester United first team, and did well too, he has plenty of character.

If we don't think that he is good enough to start with us, then send him to a smaller team where he can get starts, not to a team that use him as a squad filler.

1274~~~
Nah Januzaj is better, considering age as well.

1275~~~
Lingard and Januzaj have different styles. Lingard has better movement and a change of pace which has given our attack something different, regardless of what adnan would have offered had he stayed.

Pereira and Januzaj are more in competition with each other than lingard. Personally I'd love to see all 3 along with Marcial in the same line up in the future.

1276~~~
He's starting today in a very strong team. Only few of the regular starters are rested:

BVB: Weidenfeller, Piszczek, Bender, Hummels, Schmelzer, Weigl, Castro, Mkhitaryan, Januzaj, Reus, Aubameyang

It's definitely a big chance for him to impress.

/edit:
just saw that it changed in the warm-up to the game and Januzaj is out, Ginter is in. No idea what happened.

1277~~~
Ideally the club where the player wants to go on loan is chosen by the player and his agent rather than the club. I doubt United chose Dortmund and told him to go there. We probably told him to get some experience by going on loan and it was probably him who chose Dortmund. Only thing that makes sense.

1278~~~
Did he really get his chance though? He played 870 minutes last season. Memphis already has 570.

1279~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1280~~~
I see he's been transfered from the United bench to the Borussia bench. Pointless move.

1281~~~
Januzaj in for Reus during half time, he's got a point to prove during next 45 minutes.

1282~~~
really should have scored there.

1283~~~
Tuchel likes to feck with Redcafe it seems.

1284~~~
He's 20. What had Lingard achieved at that age? I'd be shocked if Januzaj in two years time is not a much better player than Jesse is now.

1285~~~
Exactly, and it's not as if Memphis has been playing every game himself.

Fans have laughably little patience. Fortunately, one of the things I really trust LVG with at the moment is taking his time with the kids. He doesn't seem in any rush either to hurry them into the starting XI or to ditch them at the first sign of difficulty. He'll have seen plenty from Januzaj so far at Dortmund to convince him that he's an asset for United.

1286~~~
That bit, to be fair, is definitely not true. Yes, Lingard's always been a very clever player, always one of the better decision-makers in any group at youth level. But Januzaj's decision-making in the youth teams was positively scary. He used to do something effective every single time he got on the ball. It was that, really, more even than his raw talent, which caused him to rocket through the age groups so fast. At each new level, he hit the ground running and was making the right calls and doing the right things straight away. Did it ever take him more than half a season to become his team's most effective player?

For me, we shouldn't be arguing about who deserves a shot more, who's better, who did better at what level etc. They're very different players in style, temperament, and developmental trajectory, but what is surely true is that 1) Lingard is more than earning his first team spot at the moment and 2) if Lingard can do it, so can Januzaj.

1287~~~
It's not how it works. You shouldnt dare calling Januzaj in the same breath as Shaw and Martial as well then for instance. At age 19 they've showed a far higher level than Januzaj ever has and therefore they're going tk be far better players than Januzaj. Just not how it works. Some players develop at latter stages, some players have good standard levels at young age, etc. Januzaj had a very promising debut season, but we held standards for a 18 year old back then and since that season and primary the first half that was most promising, he has showed like very little. It isnt as if he was close to a world beater as well. Januzaj may go on to become a world class player as he's still very gifted, but you cant say that because for instance Sterling aged 20 is far better than Januzaj is, Januzaj cant go on to become better in the future for example. Lingard has always been regarded as a late bloomer, even by ol' SAF himseld, he isnt as shiny as Januzaj, or Pereira but he's effective, smart, plays it simple and that is making quite a difference at the moment. He's continuously involved in our more dangerous plays for the past few games, lets see if that continues and stop the Januzaj should play instead talk,
who has shown closed to nothing since Moyes left.

1288~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
I don't expect Januzaj to start against Schalke on Sunday, even if Reus cannot play (which is unclear right now).

1289~~~
That old chestnut. It's completely impossible to have a valid opinion on a young players potential because they might still suddenly drastically improve or decline. Thanks for reminding me how it works.

1290~~~
I find it funnier he calls what he had a "decent debut season", he actually carried us, some confused opinions coming off the back of a poor season.

1291~~~
BS, what to say Shaw and Martial won't struggle in the coming years? It's all apart of development and the will be periods in which young players will struggle but battle out off, that is the norm with young player and something we will have to live with if we want to give time to youth or we could buy the finished article and not have to worry so much (then again that can also turn into a Di Maria).

1292~~~
And what did it lead us to? The most productive players were still Welbeck, RvP, Rooney, and DDG duuh who made the difference between 7th and even a lower ranking. Januzaj was a bright star in a dark season and showed great promise in that season, carrying us, him being or talisman seems rather unlikely to me with 4 goals and 4 assists in all competitions whereby 2 goals were scored on his full debut..

1293~~~
Exactly, thats the point. You cant say that a player will turn out better than the other one just because he achieved more at age X, thats basically what he's trying to say with saying Januzaj has showed more at age 20 than Lingard has. Players follow different tracks. According to the reasoning that player X will turn out better or has more potential because of the achievements at a certain ag, you couldnt even compare Januzaj to Martial and Shaw then for example, which is often done.

1294~~~
Called up for the Belgium U21 but apparently declined and decides to stay with Dortmund instead.

1295~~~
For what its worth my initial comparison was based on the qualities and attributes of each player, not based on which has had a better run of form in the first team or what they achieved at a particular age. Age only got mentioned when you suggested Januzajs chance at united was over. Lingard was out on loan up until the age of 22 yet his chance wasnt gone. 

I think Januzaj is a more talented footballer with a bigger future. Barring derailing the discussion you haven't said anything that would suggest I'm wrong.

1296~~~
I like him as a central attacking midfielder. I think his passes from center are his strongest quality.

1297~~~
He'll probably be punished to some extent for being truthful, instead of just making up a small injury.
Is it better to just lie or should players be able to be honest about not wanting to play in certain international games?

1298~~~
Still fully believe in him, what I saw 2 years ago was something special.The guy had Old Trafford at the edge of their seats.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBq9PHIwq3I?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1299~~~
Agreed

1300~~~
Punishing him would be beyond stupid.
Moving from United to Dortmund has probably been quite a big step in terms of tactics and style. He obviously needs time to adapt to those differences, especially since he didn't have a pre season with his current team and the tight match schedule probably really impacts the effectiveness of their training sessions. Having one or two more weeks of training surely will help him a lot in that regard and with large parts of the squad away on international duties Tuchel can probably pay more attention to him than he usually would.
I don't see how playing for the u21 would be more beneficial for him.

1301~~~
I meant the national team punishing him somewhere down the line, for better or worse

1302~~~
Yeah, I got that. I assume that the Belgian FA wants Januzaj to develop and realize his potential and getting play time at his club is the way to do that.

1303~~~
This may well be true but OTOH it's questionable how much he can benefit from it with the majority of 1st teamers on international duties.

If can't recall which Dortmund player said earlier this season something along the lines that Tuchel prefers simple and effective play over fancy tricks. That's something I often think of when I see Adnan on the pitch.

1304~~~
It certainly didn't do Eric Dier any harm.

1305~~~
I hope so

1306~~~
I'm still not convinced that he's that good and the only reason we're rating him is because he was the only bright spark in that shit season under Moyes. I hope he proves me wrong, but for now he just doesn't stand out as anything special.

1307~~~
I'm sure someone like Tuchel can find things to work on even when the whole team isn't there, especially stuff such as intuitive behaviour/decision making, like for example choosing when to pass vs dribble or how he has to behave when defending.

I guess every manager wants his team to play simple yet effective when they can, but most of them also allow some creative freedom as long as it's beneficial to the team. In Dortmund's case Hummels is allowed to wander up to the opponent's box when he feels like it, Gündogan is allowed to do his very high risk dribblings during build up and Mkhitaryan is allowed to play pretty selfish with his attempts to blaze through the opposition's defense or his long shots.
And it's not exactly like Januzaj made some sudden change when he joined Dortmund. I'd be surprised if Tuchel didn't know perfectly well that Januzaj has a strong tendency to take on opponents. If that bothered him he probably wouldn't have signed him and kept Kuba.

1308~~~
You can't ever have watched him for the U21s or earlier. I know what a player did in the youth teams doesn't prove anything in terms of his future <i>success</i>, but you simply can't fake talent like that. The season he had under Moyes was only par for the course for a player who rocketed through the youth sides, becoming the best player for each group within half a season.

1309~~~
And the fact remains that he hasn't really showed any improvement over the player he was 2 seasons ago. If anything, his decision making seems to have gotten worse. He has loads of improvement to do if he wants to make it with us. Right now he's still playing the same way he plays in the youth team, which can't cut it at the top level. Plenty of youth players have looked world class only to fail at the top level because they can't make the adjustment required for the step up in quality and the sooner Adnan learns this, the better it would be for his career.

1310~~~
I think his flexibility in playing different positions have stagnated a bit of his development.  Hes been used as a LM/RM/CAM and a CF; that's alot of pressure on someone to find answers for all those positions.

He needs to focus on using his dexterity to his advantage rather than against him.

I also think the loan to dortmund had to be done.  Some kids need that move to a foreign club and country to bring out their personality and along with their finalised style of play. The pogba that left us was still a kid; now the guy is a tank with a mohawk and what not.

1311~~~
What does this mean?

1312~~~
Anyone got a clip of his own goal?

1313~~~
Great clip. It really reminded me how talented he was and still is. I wish we had a management team that are great at handling youth and can still challenge or attain glory with them. 

I believe with our acedemy player, we can showcase once again that it is possible to win things with kids. 

Januzaj/Mata - Greizman/Peiera - Lingard/Depay
Martial/Wilson

I believe an attacking four above can be part of the foundation of a trophy winning team

1314~~~
He sent in a corner and the opposing player headed it in.

1315~~~
Some people just need to understand that young promising players don't need to become good players. The best performance Januzaj ever gave us should be what you expect from a top player in man united to perform every week (no need to go further into that discussion). Had Januzaj been with us today and played his status would have been a lot lower than what it is now when he's out on loan - especially if the team is performing a bit so and so.

Truth is he's not good enough. Could he become good enough? Not impossible but he's nowhere near that level today and should be showing it before we have any reason to even consider taking him back.

A great player comes once every 10 year. A typical career for a guy like Januzaj would be staying in Germany with a couple of clubs. A loan to Italy, a loan to spain, ten years has gone by and he's back in some club in Germany. It's happened a hundred times before and will continue happen. The team need to get some real talent in and not dwell over some lost talent. I am not interested in how good he is if he's not good enough for the team or needed. There are new talents waiting around the corner every year. So just stop investing so much emotional effort into each and every player that comes through and let them become class players before screaming their name. The one thing that pisses me off the most is the argument they need to play and should get a chance. You get your CHANCE if you're good enough. It shouldn't be a case of testing in a match situation regardless of how you've performed during a training session. FFS the guy on the bench could be the laziest guy in the team - so why play him?

1316~~~
o sad that we had the most exciting attacking player in the league, and we are manhester united, and that we let him go because that doesn't suit our style. 

One reason why I wouldn't mind giving giggs a couple of seasons is because he's actually going to built a fast paced team with januzaj wilson and martial involved

1317~~~
Some journalists in the past hinted coaches weren't impressed with his application in training.

1318~~~
He's had more than enough chances. It's up to him to take them. I agree with the poster who said that the great players play at a high level week in week out. That should be the standard at our club. If you can't do it, then you're not good enough. Go and play for Stoke or something.

1319~~~
I'm not interested in keeping players at the club who don't put the effort in. All the talent in the world means nothing without the right attitude and approach.

1320~~~
Except he's still a kid. That should never be the expectation for a 20 year old player.

I think that was due to 1 practice session. Article could be using that past tweet to stir up an article. Maybe they have a bone to pick with Januzaj because Januzaj denied the call up to play for Belgium's u21 side.

1321~~~
Hope you're not too disappointed that you have to take him back; it's only a one-year loan spell.

1322~~~
Didn't he take a personal trainer with him on holiday over the summer though? It'd seem strange that he'd go to that sort of effort on his holiday (when he could have just lay in front of the beach for a week with his feet up), yet when it comes to his actual job/training he lacks effort?

1323~~~
I've got mates that would do the same if they could afford it.

1324~~~
I wouldn't agree with your comments regarding Hummels, Gündogan or Mkhitaryan but let's for arguments say you're reading Tuchel's mind correctly: The big question is if Januzaj gets Tuchel's green light for large degrees of freedom which I would seriously doubt.
Furthermore, it's not too far fetched to guess that Tuchel had hopes that under his wing, Januzaj would become more of a team player than striving on showing the world his technical abilities. It's a pity that he doesn't seem to adapt quickly.

1325~~~
Wasn't it a common problem through the youth ranks at Anderlecht that Januzaj was a pretty stubborn and troublesome person to adapt? Thought i read that somewhere.

1326~~~
I'm beginning to think we rate Januzaj's performances completely different. I think thus far his dribblings have mostly been beneficial to the team. He opened up spaces for his team mates and most of the time he didn't get carried away, but played the passes to exploit them. Only against Qäbälä I had the impression that he was overly selfish. Obviously he still has a lot of work ahead of him regarding his decision making, but I really can't believe that Tuchel/Zorc would buy/loan someone like him who is all about individuality and then try
to force him into the template of a run of the mill player.

1327~~~
If United give up on the kid, I´m all for taking the risk and signing him permanently. United is not known to look for much value in most of their sells so the fee should be reasonable. 

No matter how much people start to write him off on here, the boy is still a massive talent. Once he would really become our player, we could actually start treating him like the talent he is instead of just a squad option.

What the boy needs the most right now is time and trust to on one hand develop as player but also to be integrated in the tactical system. Time is something we currently don´t have as we play most weeks twice which means two proper training sessions (one of the dedicated to the preperation of the next game) and un terms of trust he is rightfully far down the internal ranking as he is simply won´t be there long enough to invest many chances in. The last point would instantly change if we would become a "singing for the future" for us. And time would also be there in the winter break and then a proper pre season. The timing of his transfer was fairly disadvantageous for him because we were already in the season by then and  he missed the time when the foundations of the system were layed. To see the importance of a proper pre season I just need to take a look at Sahin and Kagawa, who both struggled in the first six months despite actually knowing the majority of the team.

1328~~~
From the club that gave you Giggs, Scholes, Beckham, Butt, the Nevilles, Ronaldo, Sharpe, Best, the Babes...

1329~~~
He's not going to play.

1330~~~
Which is why it's mad to have sent him to you. He would certainly have had more minutes here.

1331~~~
Anderlecht's academy director said "there are 12-, 13-, 14-year-olds who have earrings and special hair, but Adnan was a nice quiet boy, and when I see him now playing for Man United, he has not changed,” he said. "Adnan was a nice player, and technically very, very skilled, very intelligent on the pitch -- a hard worker, but a silent worker."

He was also roundly praised by our youth coaches for his attitude and hard work.

1332~~~
Obviously we do rate him very differently. Regarding your last point: It's not about changing him into a mill player. It's about using his strengths for the benefit of the <b>team</b> and adhere to the tactics as requested by Tuchel. It hasn't been written allover Adnan's face that he'd struggle to adapt.

Someone here - can't remember if it was <a class="username" data-user="70116, @Sphaero" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/70116/">@Sphaero</a> or somebody else - raised the question during the first days of his loan move if the education of tactics at United's or in general English clubs' academies prepared Adnan for what will be demanded at Dortmund. A to me even more interesting question after those 2.5 months.

Out of curiosity: What would be reasonable in your opinion? Even if the fee is affordable, I'm not convinced Adnan would be interested in a permanent move to us. Personally, I'd rather like to see an extension of Mkhitaryan's contract than anything else.

1333~~~
I pointed out the differences in style between Dortmund and United, which had the potential to become a problem for Januzaj because of the lack of a pre season. It is not really about one system being more demanding than the other, but the differences especially when it comes to defensive contribution are obvious. I was in general extremely sceptical about this move as it contradicted the main thought behind a loan (consistent game time). Him being able to become anything close to a real starter was unrealistic from the start. 

Everything up to 20 Mil. €. But of course the contract extensions of the established players take priority over any signing.

1334~~~
Thanks, then it was somebody else, possibly also in another thread.

1335~~~
Hmm guess i read it wrong then. Ty for the answer.

1336~~~
What a joke.Adnan is a quite hard worker on training according to the coaches.People began to sprout nonsense again whenever things seem to not going well for a youngster.

1337~~~
It's Derby time today in Dortmund (15:30 local time), and Adnan will be on the bench.

1338~~~
Expected.

1339~~~
Would love it if we were able to recall him in January but I'd imagine there was a fee involved ruling out a return.

1340~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/d2mf" width="560"></iframe>

Just grabbed an assist for Dortmund.

1341~~~
Clever piece of play. Can't see him get much game time throughout the season though.

1342~~~
Should call him back

1343~~~
they were losing 3-0 when he came on... he made a nice difference today. this won't escape the manager's eye.

1344~~~
He would need to surpass one of Reus/Mkhitaryan + Castro in the pecking order. Their usual defeat vs Hamburg won't change that.

1345~~~
Some quotes from Van Gaal about Januzaj:

edit: didn't realize there were two threads about Januzaj.

1346~~~
Maybe he will buckle up after realising that he can't just walk into the first team at Dortmund either. 

I don't think he has a bad attitude, but his first season success could've made him a bit lax and thinking that he already was good enough for Man Utd. 

Now he is at another club, developing his football brain while also being kept grounded by facing hard competition.

Maybe this is good for him after all, he is still only 20 so there is alot of time for him to fulfill his potential.

1347~~~
Nifty assist. 

I am still really curious to see how he continues to develop as a player and what he can offer us going forward, he's just so raw still.

1348~~~
That's a bit strange. Your manager tells you that you need to play every week and hence you should go to a PL club and do that, but he wants to go to Dortmund and still  be at a big club. Hopefully the kid's attitude isn't that he expects to be in the big time before he's good enough to because eventually if develops he will comfortably good enough to be.

1349~~~
Every indication shows that this is the case.

1350~~~
Yeah it seems so. Hopefully this Dortmund spell ends up being the thing that makes him, either through him becoming a starter (doubtful), or setting him on the right path.

1351~~~
Hardly the first player to do so, though. I remember Macheda was advised by the club to go on loan in England but he chose Italy instead. Turned out to be a very poor choice.

I can see the allure of turning out for Dortmund (plus playing CL football) instead of a relegation contender in the PL. The training facilities and the level of coaching would be a step down as well. And who knows what his agent has been advising him? Like you, I just hope he can react to this situation correctly and it somehow turns into a plus for him.

1352~~~
Definitely. It's a cool club. Good players, coaches, facilities etc. If I was a professional footballer it would be very high on my list of clubs I'd like to play at. When he looks back on his career he'll probably have some great memories. It's got to be a lot more appealing than spending a season at Sunderland.

I think in the short term it will hurt him because he probably won't play enough impress LVG etc. But hopefully he will learn a lot that he can take with him going forward. FWIW I still think he's going to be a terrific player. Even as it stands he just needs to strengthen up a bit and learn how to protect the ball a bit better and he'd be more than decent.

1353~~~
BVB: Weidenfeller, Piszczek, Hummels, Bender, Schmelzer, Weigl, Gündogan, Hofmann, Castro, Mkhitaryan, Ramos 

yet again no Januzaj in the starting lineup

1354~~~
ridiculous. just how bad IS his attitude to not get a look in? he had a really good cameo in the last match and still no starting place in spite of the lack of attacking players dortmund have opted to field.

what an asinine loan this has been, whether it's his fault or United's.

1355~~~
This is really worrying, if you consider that Auba, Reus and Kagawa are rested. When is he supposed to get playing time if not today?

1356~~~
Lack of attacking players? Mkhitaryan has been one of Dortmund's best players this season and Castro is the first choice replacement for the AM positions, so it was basically Hofmann vs Januzaj for the last spot.

Yes, it's really shitty for Januzaj. But at the same time this isn't exactly a surprising development or malicious on Tuchel's part. There was always a good chance it would be like this. Aside from Reus Dortmund's attacking players simply haven't been injured so it's the same problem for Hofmann.

1357~~~
well, he's already made an impact. great set up there.

1358~~~
We need strength in numbers, we're seriously lacking in squad depth and it's crazy we're loaning out a player in this situation. 

Get him back.

1359~~~
Reading through this thread I didn't realise Adnan had an 'attitude' problem<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> It never occurred to me. If he does, I hope he sorts it out or it would be a waste of his talents. I always thought he was a little too timid, and that was why I was happy he went on loan away from the pressure of United so he could gain some confidence. Interested to see how this pans out..

1360~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/gc7k" width="560"></iframe>

Bastard's starting to corrupt the kid with philosophy.

1361~~~
K-Quick

1362~~~
When was that? Why the hell is he playing kickball with a ball boy?

1363~~~
It's madness to me that we have Jesse Lingard grabbing significant playing time for us, while Januzaj is on loan. I know he is frustrating, but his ceiling (and level at the moment,) strikes me as being higher than Lingard's.

1364~~~
Lingard is more a safer player though and tracks back more so fits LVG's ball retaining philosophy more i guess.

But yeah Januzaj is better right now and i will be shocked if he doesn't have a better individual career than Lingard.

1365~~~
If Januzaj doesn't have a better career than Lingard then he's only got himself to blame. He has elite level natural footballing talent for me. If he works hard nothing can stop him from becoming a top player.

1366~~~
Jesse is playing better than Januzaj was for us post-Moyes, so dont really know what you on about. The manager plays his current best players.

1367~~~
That kids short passing game is better than rooneys <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1368~~~
Yeah that's my reddit. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1369~~~
Other than that goal, which was admittedly nice, my lasting Lingard memories thus far are a host of missed chances, getting nutmegged and going for a walkabout right after and taking his sweet time to get up until the ball was coming at him. At least Januzaj has shown a high ceiling.

1370~~~
I remember great runs and movement, one of the few threats, pace, attacking intent, good link up, creating chances and yes the missed chance. But I rather have a player who misses chances than a player that doesnt have the skill/instict to even get in those positions.

1371~~~
And you dont think Januzaj has the skill to do that?

1372~~~
Didnt show that on the base of last season, hasnt been too productive at Dortmund as well. But even that's irrelevant, for LVG its relevant what the players show at United in his team, Lingard has showed and even produced more statistically than Januzaj did in the whole season. That"s what important. Not that he is great or anything but he is functional and keeps it simple.

1373~~~
Well Januzaj has produced more this season.

1374~~~
Januzaj got the Villa game and the Newcastle game, both games where he played decently but wasnt involved in the movt like he should have. he did score against villa but he was hauled off both games at 60th minute iirc. Lingard on the other hand took his chances, gets involved in our attack and gets in the right positions to score. He missed chances but he also got into the chances to score, which is something more than what januzaj showed in the last 2 seasons at united. There is no question that lingard deserves his run out in the team.

1375~~~
Are Dortmund giving him game time? If not, maybe clubs can mutually agree to send him back?

1376~~~
Januzaj is more talented but Lingard is well ahead in the development curve.It's that simple.

1377~~~
IIRC, LvG said he wouldn't call him back in January. Furthermore, Dortmund will only let him go if we have a replacement. We've been incredibly lucky to haven't experienced major injuries in our attack and need depth in that area. It wouldn't make a lot of sense, however, to hire someone in January; not just because of the inflated prices but most importantly because any new player would need time to adapt.

1378~~~
Ya in 2nd half of season I guess Dortmund will use him more. LvG has taken into account squad wise not having Januzaj till end of season and on top of that he has let Wilson go so ya he won't trigger release in Jan. If Januzaj is to come back in Jan it will be if both club mutually agree as such season long deals usually have some financial penalty if cancelled by one party in between.
I was hoping Januzaj gets more game time, contributes and comes back with lots of confidence. Let's see if it happens in 2nd half.

1379~~~
he needs a quick fix to keep his job alive. 

OT starting to become slightly toxic if mufc haven't got goals by half time.

1380~~~
Depends on how the league plays out, but I can't see that at all. Right now, Januzaj doesn't start in dead rubber EL games with 3 regular starters in attack rested. And there are no dead rubber EL games in the 2nd half of the season. Januzaj doesn't start in cup games against lower division sides either, and the cup games in the 2nd half of the season will be more difficult.

Unless there's a crazy injury crisis, getting playing time will become more difficult in the 2nd half of the season unless his performances become so valuable that he increases Dortmund's chances to win trophies. I can't see that happen at the moment. Dortmund has no incentive to start him over their regulars, their back-ups with longterm contracts or their youth talents if Januzaj leaves the club a few months later anyway.

For Januzaj's sake, the clubs should sort this out in my opinion. If van Gaal/United believe in him and see a future for him at the club after the loan, they should buy him out of the loan deal and give him playing time at United or find a different club for a loan deal. If they don't, they should talk to Dortmund to make the move permanent (if Dortmund are interested). It's one of the most idiotic loan deals I've seen in like forever. He needs to play as much as possible at his age. I can't think of a single player who made a step forward by being loaned out and sitting on the bench for a full year. It's madness.

1381~~~
He has to come back IMO. We aren't blessed with options and need someone who can produce a bit of magic which is something, if anything, he has. And also, he is among our 2-3 biggest young talents. We really can't afford to just let a season go by with him sat around on benches for 80% of the time. So yeah, get the kid back. Work with him to sort out whatever attitude/training issues he has, and give him chances. Sometimes a kid improves by playing. His return is just a no-brainer for me in the interest of the club, and the player himself, and we should try our best to make it happen.

1382~~~
Yep. Btw, he's the one who insisted on the loan being to Dortmund. Anyways, what is done is done. IMO he will add a lot to our football given how things have panned out this season.

1383~~~
I know. The club should have told him that he's not allowed to go to a club where he's likely to play even less. The loan deal was totally strange, it happened out of nowhere after Januzaj started most games at United in August. I guess it was a massively rushed decision. Dortmund maybe asked for him late in the transfer window because they lacked depth, van Gaal wasn't convinced that he's ready to start throughout the season. Maybe van Gaal/United/Januzaj underrated the quality at Dortmund after the horrible season they had, maybe Januzaj is simply delusional about how good he is. Either way, it was a mistake. There's no point in looking for someone to blame now, the clubs and the player need to make a good decision for his future.

1384~~~
Agreed.

I also don't think he did badly for us when he was given 4 starts before being loaned out.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6y_NJlgwEYU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1385~~~
The rules don't allow Januzaj to be loaned to another club this season. He either stays at Dortmund or returns to United.

Whether LvG's job is at risk could, with all due respect to United, not be the least interesting matter to Dortmund. If there's no replacement for Januzaj, he would need to stay. I don't expect one of our youth players to step up to the plate because Tuchel recently mentioned that he dislikes how much pressure they are getting already now, that he wants to build them up very carefully. As mentioned, we won't buy someone in January, the only exception being if a player becomes available we really want to have as a long-term solution.

I can't recall who broke the news and don't think it was a trustworthy source; however, the very first time I heard this summer rumors linking Dortmund and Januzaj was before the leagues had kicked off, that Dortmund targeted him as a permanent transfer but he wasn't interested.
Perhaps there was more substance to this rumor than I thought and that the two parties who didn't come together for a permanent deal were able to get things sorted out quickly for a loan deal.
I may be wrong but nothing indicates to me that we're interested to still buy him not that he'd be interested to stay.

1386~~~
Another game with Januzaj not getting any minutes today. This loan was a seriously stupid idea and if we have the option to cancel we need to take it asap.

1387~~~
We shouldn't have let him go there but it's his own fault really. He most likely had offers from teams where he'd be pushing for a starting place but he chose a team which has an abundance of attacking talent. He needs to cut it short in Jan or it'll be another year wasted.

1388~~~
Yep it is his own fault. Hope he's learned his lesson. He chose to go there, didn't want to listen to the manager to go to a mid-table team here so he could get more minutes. So unfortunately for the lad, he reaps what he sowes.

1389~~~
The loan to Dortmund was an incredibly stupid decision but what it does show is how overrated he is by some on here.

Januzaj is no better than other talented kids in other PL teams but some will have you believe he's a potential worldie. From about half way through the Moyes season till now he has been very poor IMO.

First off what kind of player is he?

A winger? Not in my book. He tries to take on players for pace and skill and isn't very effective. His crosses have a weird shape on them and are often overhit.

Attacking Mid? In the reserves it seemed like he would be this player but since joining the first team he's lacked the weight of pass and decision making by being very greedy and opting to take poor shots.

At present he's not creative or enough of a goal threat. No one can confidently pinpoint what sort of player he is. He could easily fulfill some of his early promise but I won't be surprised if he ends up following the likes of Canales, Reyes, Nasri as players expected to be stars but fall well short of that.

1390~~~
Stopped reading at this point

1391~~~
Its good Januzaj isnt here, LVG has shown at United hes very good at destroying and removing confidence from players who take risks, and try make things happen by benching them,he would have regressed under LVG imo

1392~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1393~~~
This is turning out to be a complete nightmare of a loan deal, recall him and send him over to Valencia - Gary will actually care about his development and will probably give him a run.

1394~~~
Don't think two loans in one season is possible.

1395~~~
Kid was schooling him. Adnan started with the trickery and kid was having none of it. SIMPLE PASSES. QUICK AND SIMPLE. 

Bit strange though that he didn´t warm up with his team mates. On the photos he´s always with Reus and Aubameyang. Maybe LVG has send him to Dortmund as a secret recruiter. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1396~~~
Judging by the pics I have seen here, we might need to drug Reus and get him too if we're to get januzaj out of there.

1397~~~
Is he getting game time there??

1398~~~
160 mins in the league all season.

1399~~~
Bravo!! He should look to come back. Not that LvG will give him a better chance. But at least given how people get injured at Utd, he will be playing something

1400~~~
Would you not rather he train with a great attacking unit that is full of movement and fast link up play. Or would you rather he get crushed under the burden of creating something out of nothing for a disjointed, slow attack with no penetration? Some times, playing time can be a bad thing for a young player. I think this is one of those times for Januzaj at United. Not playing so much but training with Dortmund will give him a lot more then playing for United at the moment.

1401~~~
Hopefully it's a bit of a wakeup call and he'll realise he has no rights to expect to start regularly for us... yet.

1402~~~
Spot on. He either stays or returns.

BTW, rumors that Jonas Hofmann may leave in January intensify this week. If so, Adnan may move up the pecking order. OTOH, our CEO made it clear that in the unlikely event any player leaves, we'd fill the vacancy with young prospects as a pre-investment for summer '16. He didn't mention names but theoretically, even Januzaj would fit this description.

1403~~~
Ofcourse he'd get games. Much more than Dortmund anyways. We would play him because his future is with us and that's vital. Dortmund have no such incentive as he's going to leave EOS anyways. Whatever game time they can give, they give to Hofmann. 
Absolute nonsense. There's nothing more vital at his age than minutes on the pitch. 
Yup. Think this should get him back on earth  a bit. LVG warned him about his and he still went there.

1404~~~
Is there anything that suggests he'd have more playing time here? Note that 'our attack is shit/our attacking players are shit' doesn't really mean anything for him.

1405~~~
Well if he has to return to the so-called "insepid" style of football, then what is the point of him training with a team full of movement. Anyways I dont think anything could compensate the minutes on the pitch.

1406~~~
Get him back here I think. Throw an arm around him, but let him know that he'll need to work his ass off, just like everyone else, to get game time.

1407~~~
We have a reason to play him even if he isn't in top form. Dortmund don't.

1408~~~
But did we play him enough last or this season though?

1409~~~
There are more opportunities now with Di Maria gone and Memphis needing time to settle. Defensive injuries have forced young into the backline leaving us with plenty of chances to give to januzaj.

1410~~~
Wishful thinking really. As you've said, we've got Memphis, Lingard started playing somewhat regularly, Rooney's the undropable one and then there's Martial, so ADM's exit didn't help much, Young being played at RB/LB might have but if we'll switch back (due to injuries blablabla shit) to 352 it wouldn't have helped Adnan either.

1411~~~
Lingard took januzaj's place in the squad. Januzaj could also play centrally. Started 2 games for us before he was loaned out.

1412~~~
He's one of the most talented young players in the world, but it looks like his very early success and high wages resulted in a huge ego. He acts like he's one of the best, but he has done feck all so far, except some decent half of season under Moyes.

He's one of my favorite players at the club, but he needs to get his shit together, start working hard and don't let his pride affect his important decisions. It's a shame, because when he broke in the first team he looked like he was one of the most down to earth, hard working and professional young players out there, I guess fame changes people...

1413~~~
Would Januzaj play ahead of Herrera at #10 or Rooney (of course he wouldn't) when Martial's up top?

1414~~~
It's hard to say, but he started 4 games in a row before he went to Dortmund, with Herrera available for selection. I think he would have played more here, than he does at BVB.

1415~~~
Fair enough then.

1416~~~
I agree, and I actually thought he did ok, so was surprised when he was let go.

1417~~~
Finally a reason to bump this thread.

1418~~~
that appears to be a strong line up... good for him. hopefully he has a good showing.

1419~~~
I hope he has a stormer.

1420~~~
<a class="username" data-user="82770, @caisenma" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82770/">@caisenma</a>
Not really. Reus, Kagawa, Ginter and Hummels can be considered starters; Weidenfeller, Bender, Subotic, Parc, Bender and Ramos are all subs, and Stenzel makes his debut as a starter today.

1421~~~
Subotic had a good game against Wolfsburg.

1422~~~
Glad he's starting. Hope he has a good game.

1423~~~
Was always hoping: Reus Kagawa Januzaj would have been our starting trio at some point.

1424~~~
They are losing 1-0 at half time <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1425~~~
Is anyone watching? How's he doing?

1426~~~
Reus off, Mkhitaryan on.

Januzaj just played Mkhitaryan through with a great pass and it should've been 1-1. Now fighting with a PAOK player.

1427~~~
Going off twitter not good at all it seems.

1428~~~
He doesn´t seem to be part of the squad today.

1429~~~
Can we get him back in January? I think there's no recall clause but surely we could persuade Dortmund to give him back given he's not really that big a part of their plans?

1430~~~
Don't think Lvg wants him back.

1431~~~
Really want to see him back in a United shirt.

1432~~~
He may not be the manager for long. Depends on the views of his successor should he go - if it's Giggs, I wouldn't be surprised to see him back.

1433~~~
This was an odd loan really, wasn't it?

1434~~~
Like all the LVG decisions if truth be told. He's one player who can offer something different in Mata's position and we send him out on loan?

1435~~~
<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/januzaj-confirmed-on-loan-at-dortmund.408777/page-32">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/januzaj-confirmed-on-loan-at-dortmund.408777/page-32</a>
Januzaj may not play an important role as a starter but he does as a fringe player. We've been extremely lucky with injuries - even Reus had comparably minor ones - and won't push our luck by triming our squad even further.

1436~~~

1437~~~
That's not Januzaj. It's a young Steven Hawking.

1438~~~
What? Is that an old pic or? I know Dortmund have winterbreak but still weird to see him here then.

1439~~~
Good to see one of our attackers get in the box for once.

1440~~~
Not sure. I know Paul Rantcast always has seats next to the box were Fergie and such are sitting as well. Maybe Januzaj flew back for a bit?

1441~~~
Can't find it, but one of the youth team keepers posted a picture with Januzaj on Instagram, saying it was good to see him back for a few days.

1442~~~
Fergie are bringing Januzaj back.

1443~~~
Are we allowed to bring him back in January? If so it is a must. He's not getting a lot of game time and we could really do with him right now, especially as he can play in all 4 attacking options.

Adnan Januzaj could return to Man United in January after failing to impress on loan at Borussia Dortmund. (Source: Sun Sport)

1446~~~
Bring him back, it was stupid to loan him in the first place.

1447~~~
Think one of our BVB residents made a good point that he's probably not going back here in January as they're selling/loaning Jonas Hofmann somewhere.

1448~~~
Dortmund already have a gaping hole in terms of squad depth. Castro, Januzaj, Sahin and Ramos are their only offensive options.
Castro has been doing well as the they went deeper into the season, probably genuinely threatening Kagawa.
Sahin should be a very serious option for the CM positions too, but aside from a hand full of games last winter he was injured for more than a year now, so I doubt they can trust him to play a bigger role soon. And even if he's back 100% he could only replace one of the attackers if they move Gündogan from his best position and let Sahin fill in for him.
Ramos has shown some improvement, but unless a miracle happens he's at least one step below the rest of the squad in terms of quality.

No way will Dortmund enter the second half of the season (and three competitions) with those three as their only attacking back ups and if United had an option to "forcefully" terminate the loan I doubt that they would've sold Hofmann this early before they finalized one or two signings. Besides, even if their bench was stacked with quality, why would they let Januzaj go? According to the more trustworthy media they don't even pay his full salary, he basically costs them nothing and with his talent he is always an interesting option.

1449~~~
He is an option during times of desperation but he isn't going anywhere as a footballer either.  Another welbeck. Overhyped because he came from the youth.

1450~~~
<a class="username" data-user="52625, @do.ob" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/52625/">@do.ob</a>
It remains to be seen how Tuchel plays him but I wouldn't consider Nuri as an attacking option, neither full term nor back-up. This leaves us with Mkhitaryan, Reus, Kagawa, Castro, Ramos/Aubame and although I'm not convinced of him either Gündogan - and Januzaj. That's almost as slim as Tuchel's body mass index.

I doubt that Felix Passlack is considered to be an option yet and therefore agree that it's more likely Dortmund will buy another attacking player than let anybody further leave.

1451~~~
Some of the people in this thread need to pull their heads out of their arse and realize that this kid is only 20. I never seen a young player getting so much shit like this guy. Even when he was here and had a decent game here and there people were swarming this thread to give him shit, it's ridiculous.

He came in the team at 18 and had a good season, now it's like people expect him to play like Messi or Ronaldo.

He hasn't progressed much in the last year or so and it looks like his loan is a big fail, but he has showed that he has the talent to succeed. It's up to him if he can make it happen or not.

1452~~~
if he's as good as some on here claim, it's not unreasonable to want him to be close to those two at age 20 - and he's nowhere near.

1453~~~
So if he's not as good as those two were, does that mean he's shit?

1454~~~
essentially, yes. or at least that's how it would sound by some people.

there've been some that have been entirely over the top in praising him, and others who are too easily ready to slate him. regardless, i just want him to get minutes somewhere - anywhere, so that he can be a real asset for us. i fall into the category that think he has what it takes to be a special player.

1455~~~
No, but I said "close to". I think we should be going for players at that sort of level.

1456~~~
So only the young Messi or Ronaldo, or players who are <i>nearly</i> as good are good enough for us. Ok, message received and understood.

1457~~~
I think that people on here have a tendency to massively overrate our young players, when IMO most of the current crop will be playing for the likes of Sunderland in a few years time.

1458~~~
I don't think anyone would dispute that, though. There are fifty or so youngsters on the radar at the moment, and even the most optimistic wouldn't expect to see more than three or four in a future starting line-up at a time.

No-one who rates our youngsters is saying that every single one who could play for us is going to be good enough to. The point is that if you have five at that level, you'd hope to see one of them break through.

Putting all that aside, people are being down on Januzaj in this thread at the moment because he's not playing football. That's ridiculous. He's at a foreign club, in a foreign country, competing with a set of attacking players that not only features one of the best in the world, Reus, but is also gelling really well and performing brilliantly. If he was playing regularly and badly, then you could draw conclusions, but there's really nothing to be taken from this other than that, after an initially promising start, the loan spell has proven to be overambitious. We should bring him back in January and possibly look for something in a bottom-half PL team for him instead.

1459~~~
This thread depresses me so much, I had such high hopes from Adnan and for various reasons (fault of the player, club etc) all the hopes are being destroyed. So many people put him down when he was here but I would happily take him over Memphis right now.

1460~~~
This is not a viable option in January. The rules don't allow that a player plays for three different clubs in one season. Therefore he either stays until the end of the season at Dortmund or returns to United in January.

1461~~~
I remember some chat about LvG wanting to turn him into a striker, I wonder if buying one isn't an option whether he'll try and bring Adnan back to fill the 2nd/3rd rd striker role.

Would love to have him back but only if LvG is going to play him, which given the Europa is looming they'll be every opportunity..

1462~~~
He wouldn't transform us to title winners but he could give us much needed options upfront

1463~~~
Put simply...if he's not playing he needs to come back. Our squad isn't big enough to also fill the squads of other good teams

1464~~~
Dortmund are being linked with Partizan's Zivkovic and to a bit lesser extend Heereenven's Larsson. Both of them are two young technichally gifted attacking midfielders. So from the looks of it Dortmund will be replacig Hofmann with a more promising young player. Which may or may not make things easier for Adnan, depending on how well or quickly the new guy settles in.

1465~~~
Serbian media confirm rumors yesterday - <a class="externalLink" href="http://futbolgrad.com/zivkovic-headed-to-borussia-dortmund/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://futbolgrad.com/zivkovic-headed-to-borussia-dortmund/</a> - but I don't buy it until Thomas Hennecke or RuhrNachrichten confirm. IIRC, Zivkovic is left-footed which is what Tuchel was (also) looking for in a potential Yarmolenko move last summer which didn't pan out as we all know.

If Zivkovic joins now, Tuchel might consider Adnan surplus and let him return (if he wants to).

1466~~~
Great addition if true, i'm a fan of Zivkovic

1467~~~
If this transfer comes to fruition, he'd be Europa League-tied for BVB; therefore, I personally would not let Adnan return in January to United but Tuchel might think differently. If that happens, Adnan would be Europa League-tied for United.

In less than a month we'll know. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1468~~~
Good.

Pointless move in the first place.

1469~~~

1470~~~
breaking everywhere.

1471~~~
Yes, Jan just saw Duckers tweet.

1472~~~
Get in like a new signing, would rather just give him games than smash loads of money on players who are overpriced.

1473~~~
Well let's just play him, and Keane, and anyone but Rooney and Mata.

1474~~~
Thank god because his worst is better than anything Memphis can conjure up

1475~~~
He cant be any worse than memphis has been, maybe they can have a "Who has the worst attitude" competition to fight for a spot.

1476~~~
Our joint 6th top scorer in the league this season.

1477~~~
Januzaj has scored 5 goals for us in 60 games.
Memphis has scored 5 goals for us in 23 games.

Both have been terribly inconsistent with us but one had about a year's worth of it before being loaned out, the other has had about 10 games. Settle yourselves down a bit lads.

1478~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You miss the last season and a half?

1479~~~
I'll tell you what his 'Skills' youtube video is way better than Anderson's.

1480~~~
Delighted if this stops the Anderson transfer.

1481~~~
You clearly haven't seen enough Januzaj. He's at least as bad as Memphis. There's a reason he didn't play for Dortmund. 
I hope I'm wrong, but I am not excited about him coming back. I don't think this is the type of boost we want.

1482~~~
I guess he simply had too much competition for his position at Dortmund; Reus, Miki, Kagawa, Castro. It's fair game that he can't get a place ahead of them, doesn't automatically make him as shit as Memphis has been. Tactically, stylistically, competitively, he just didn't fit in.

1483~~~
He was often quite good when he played, actually, and Tuchel's comments on him were positive. As you say, you can't blame him for leaving the lad on the bench with such good senior players in such hot form ahead of him.

I'm glad to have him back. When his confidence is up he's a superb player, and with Memphis unable to find form at the moment another wide man who can beat a man with pace and dribbling is very welcome.

1484~~~
Not sure there's anything to stop, but if there is then I agree.

Januzaj might not be the nice shiny new signing everybody wanted but it is exciting all the same, get a defender in now and we will finally have a squad with a bit of depth, then it's over to LvG.

1485~~~
Bs.He has show plenty of positive things when he played this season.Of course that wasn't enough for him to play regularly at either club but Memphis was really out of his depth and that comes from someone who believe he has a future here.

About Januzaj coming back,I don't think he'll be thrown straight to the starting XI but we surely can benefit from the increased competition.Memphis and Mata certainly need more competitors for their places to kick their ass up and we can have something from the bench now other than the afroman.

1486~~~
LVG is just making it up as he goes along.

1487~~~
Better than being stubborn when things didn't work out though.

1488~~~
If it is LVG making these kind of decisions I'd be interested to know how that compares to other big clubs. Has he decided to send Powell on loan for example or have Forest come to Woodward(?) and asked if Powell is surplus to requirements at the moment?

Comes back to this DOF that a few people have been writing about in recent months and whether the manager should be allowed this kind of power, or whether he even wants it.

1489~~~
He will walk straight on to the bench but will get starts once he gets his fitness right considering Bundesliga has been on a break.

1490~~~

1491~~~
So he's been recalled. Was his spell there really bad? I seem to remember it starting ok.

1492~~~
Not very good, hardly played, also I think when he played in a league game (I think it was a league game) he got the worst rating ever.

1493~~~
It was never a good decision to for him to go to BVB but apparently he insisted on it over a championship side so thats on him.
With LVG I get the sense that he just keeps throwing shit at the wall and hoping some of it sticks.

1494~~~
Looking forward to seeing him back. I just hope he's not thrown in as a central midfielder at the weekend then sold for being awful. 

We could really benefit from his creativity out wide if he can find form again.

1495~~~
If Adnan can get his belief back, he can provide the outlet on the right wing that we really need though. At his best Adnan ghosts past players and he has good delivery. Martial is offering that on the left, if we get it from Adnan on the right too our season might change significantly. Adnan has had a terrible time of it under Van Gaal, if given a chance I still believe he could go on to be brilliant for United.

1496~~~
Excellent. Don't care how he did for Dortmund but I've seen more than enough from him to know he's a fantastic talent. I'll be distraught if we manage to somehow feck up one of the best talents to come through our academy in some time.

1497~~~
Serious question, what will he offer than Mata can't on the right wing?

1498~~~
I think he has the ability to pass a full back with his dribbling. Something mata will never do. Also has more pace

1499~~~
If he can regain some of his form from Moyes's season - ability to beat his player consistently with pace and trickery, more consistent delivery, ability to turn on the ball, ability to control the ball in tight areas of the field. He also has an eye for the killer pass, and the ability to deliver it with high accuracy, but I feel that Mata also has this trait but doesn't try it as often as he should, however, he doesn't have the penetrating runs off the ball needed to do this at a high rate.

1500~~~
Yes, true. Hopefully he does just that - can see the difference Young made against Swansea.

1501~~~
Great news, will be like a new signing.  If we can play like we did in the first half against Chelsea, bombing forward on the break, he can definitely contribute something.

1502~~~
Whoever wants Adnan to provide a spark through his dribbling, well I hope you don't overly criticize him so much when he loses the ball. That's the thing with dribbling. The decision to dribble is the decision making. The ability to pull off the dribble is what affects fan's perception of the player's decision making. 

I personally want him to cut back on his dribbing and focus more on being dangerous through his passing.

1503~~~
My guess is LVG won't afford him the same patience as he has done with Memphis.

1504~~~
Did they expect him to fire on all cylinders ? When you have a loan spell at Dortmund you will eventually face the same you were in before. 

More playing time as a youngster vs a lower classed club > more playing time
More playing time as a youngster at a big club > less playing time

Its that simple really. The wrong club to develop, should have stayed in the Premier League as LVG stated earlier.

1505~~~
Exactly. It's why I eagerly await the return of valencia so young can go back to wing. Atleast he takes on players and has good delivery

1506~~~
People who are saying he's bad are ridiculous, we've all seen how well he can play.

I think it's down to a case of tactics/instructions.

If he is given a free creative role he will flourish, do you honestly see players let alone midfielders getting a "free" role in a LVG team?

1507~~~
^^^^This^^^^

We have seen him play outstanding, we have seen him be average and we have seen him struggle - the question is, will this "philosophy" give him an opportunity to succeed.

There have been some very talented players not be able to succeed in this style - DiMaria comes to mind.

If Adnan can create chances on the dribble or the pass - and if LVG can accept that and overlook some of his mistakes, I think he will make it.

If not - he will make it elsewhere in time.

1508~~~
Ronaldo and Fergie showed that allowing a brilliant player creative freedom even if it means he loses the ball from time to time and has to have someone to cover in case he does isn't exactly always a bad thing for the team.

It's all made up for when there's that spark of genius to win a match.

1509~~~
That match vs norwich seems eons ago

1510~~~
I dunno,
You have to strike a balance.
Ronaldos last season for us, with him shooting on sight and basically never passing was kind of frustrating at times.

I'm not against a bit of discipline and everyone pitching in a bit. Van Gaal probably takes it a bit far though.

1511~~~
IIRC it was a Europa League game where it should be said to his defense that the whole team did not perform very well. He was, however, recognized as the worst player in said poor team.

1512~~~
I'm not against that either, which is why that freedom is generally only given to one player.

A special player.

1513~~~
Funny how he can be worse when nearly 21 than he was when he was 18, and he was consistent enough that moyes season. Tells me that it's expectations, difficulties working within the tactics, confidence. 

If he can rediscover the confidence while working within van gaals system he can make a difference. People are going to think it's ridiculous but during moyes season he was our martial - nothing happened without him making it happen. I hope he plays on the right wing with some space and has the freedom to run at people and make things happen. Him and martial down either side and we might actually make some chances and generate some atmosphere in OT the second half of the season. 

Doesn't really solve our problem of someone going in and taking those chances ruthlessly tho

1514~~~
Completely disagree with this tbh.
Think people exaggerated his impact under moyes and were too harsh on his impact last season which was more or less the same imo.
A couple of volleys came off under moyes, under van gaal they were blocked or went an inch or two over.
Fine margins and all that.

1515~~~
Indeed. He was a magical young player destined for greatness amidst a pile of rubble, at the time. That's why I have hope for him and his potential, because we've already seen him do brilliant things. Imagine 13/14 Januzaj and 15/16 martial in tandem. All it needs it 13/15 Memphis and were sorted <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1516~~~
i assume he's cup tied?

Shame if so, as Europa would've been perfect for him to get lots of game time here.

1517~~~
Talented kid but I'm not surprised that LvG, Tuchel and Wilmots are not convinced in him at this moment in time. There was an article in the other Januzaj thread that was basically saying Adnan thinks he's better than he is and it is so true. He's a player that plays for himself; taking shots when he should pass and running into packs of defenders only to lose the ball. With some players, you allow them to be individuals if they return the numbers (e.g. Ronaldo, Robben and Sturridge even) but in Adnan's case he returns poor numbers for both goals and assists and that would infuriate any manager given his style of play.

I'm not writing him off but before he can even be seen as anything useful for our club, we need to decide what kind of player he is because right now I don't think anyone really knows.

He's played as a winger the most but I'm not convinced because he lacks the pace and is not that great a dribbler imo. 

Adnan himself seems to think he's a long term No.10 but his passing is mediocre and also does he have the intelligence to play there? 

LvG during pre-season said he saw him as a striker and interestingly enough Moyes shared that opinion could they be right?

1518~~~
I wonder why he hasn't progressed at all since 13/14.

1519~~~
His passing isn't mediocre. No idea where you got that idea from.

1520~~~
I loathe highlight reel videos in most cases - but this stuff didn't happen by accident. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBq9PHIwq3I?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

The philosophy must've coached it out of him - because it's been a while since he looked as free as he did under Moyes-eh

1521~~~
Can't stand this kid.  All that video showed was him bursting away from a few defenders.  Him scoring them two goals on has debut has just painted the wrong picture.  Look at Macheda now!  I have more faith in Jesse. We need to send this kid to a Championship club.

1522~~~
edit: posted in main forum

1523~~~
Yeah, he's a horrible human being.

1524~~~
Just shows that talent is only half the equation. You can't teach heart and desire.

1525~~~

1526~~~
Christ.

1527~~~
Superb evaluation <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1528~~~
any chance he'll play today?

1529~~~
Gulag imo.

1530~~~
nope gonna play with u21s on monday night

1531~~~
Can pretty much cement any attacking position if he strings a few good performances at this rate.

1532~~~
BTW, is there any compilation of his home performance vs Newcastle in 2013?

1533~~~
Sending Januzaj on loan is quite possibly the weirdest thing LVG has done. I still can't get over how utterly stupid it was. In his only 2 games with us, he scored the winner against Villa after a beautiful turn and proceeded to play two excellent through balls against Newcastle which should have resulted in a winner if not for the Depay being shit and the ref.

Hopefully LVG stops being stubborn and gives him the same amount of chances and patience as Depay. I have no doubt he'll come good given the chances.

1534~~~
Well, that's pretty harsh from Tuchel. I do think that Januzaj probably realized very early that the competition would be too tough for him. 
So maybe he just didn't give his 100% since he couldn't expect to get more playing time anyway.

We had a situation like that also with a Kalas loan to Cologne. When we loaned him out Cologne had one of the best defensives in the league. There was no reason for the Cologne manager to bring Kalas into the team. So we had player with CL experience who was loaned to a minor team in the Bundesliga and could't get a game. Compared to that Januzaj did actually better.

1535~~~
You should probably do a bit more research before you say silly things.

1536~~~
Like what?

1537~~~
He started 4 games for us this season and was pretty poor. He wasn't going to feature in every match and it was decided it would be better for his development if he went on loan. He chose Dortmund despite advice from LVG to choose a club that will start him every game and LVG decided to let him go there and learn the hard way.

He's got a lot to improve before he's worthy of starting regularly for us and if his attitude is as multiple reports and coaches say it is, sending him to a bottom half EPL side against his wishes would only serve to bring the worst out of him. 

He'll have hopefully learnt a big lesson in Dortmund and will realise where he actually sits on the football ladder right now. Time for him to get his head down and train hard to save his career. He'll only have himself to blame if he doesn't make it.

1538~~~
People are being a tad overly dramatic with Januzaj's situation. Let's not forget that he's just 20 years old. He's still quite ahead in his development even compared to other big talents at his age. Sitting on the bench at Dortmund for 4 months has hardly put him in a position where he has to "save his career" or anything like that.

1539~~~
I completely forgot about the Brugge games so fair enough but I don't agree about the PL games. He's still inconsistent within games but in both games he produced moments of real quality.

For me he's the kind of player that needs to get a run of game to prosper and he really hasn't had that since LVG has been here. He hasn't even had consistency in the position he plays in.

1540~~~
Hang on, you can't excuse him for spitting the dummy at that situation. That (his not yours) is a terrible attitude to have and to approach any opportunity with.

Tuchel's quote is too sensored if anything. Januzaj needs to be hit with the cold, hard truth and have his outlook questioned in a more severe fashion by all around him if that truly was his attitude to it all.

1541~~~
The point I was trying to make is that Dortmund's attack was working pretty well even without Januzaj. So him giving 110% in training probably wouldn't have changed his situation a lot. That's why I made the comparison with Kalas and the Cologne loan deal. 

Of course he is probably too pampered and his immediate environment most likely feeds his ego as being destined to be a star. But that's just the reality of a footballer's life nowadays. He won't suddenly put on a Vardy-attitude.

1542~~~
Hopefully now the kid really knuckles down and works hard on becoming the player he can become over the next 2-3 years.

But I also think he might be someone who needs a manager putting more faith in him than LVG does. I'd love LVG to persist and trust his talent the way he's done with Memphis for the last 5 months. I'm hoping to see Januzaj's game explode into life under the next manager, if he struggles under LVG this season.

1543~~~
That wouldn't make it any better, would it? I mean first of all he's not just training for Dortmund, but also for himself, so not putting in the full effort is stupid either way. Secondly even his ego is a big inflated surely he could not have expected to be getting regular starts for a club like Dortmund, especially as a loan player? And it's not like Dortmund's first XI played every minute. Reus had some injury troubles again, Castro needed some time to adapt and Ramos' quality can and should be seriously doubted. There were plenty of minutes up for grabs.
I still think he could easily have been an important sub for Dortmund, with his talent and the kind of freedom Dortmund gives to their attackers he could've been great.

1544~~~
Am i the only one who reads that as, Dortmund wanted him on loan not only as cover but as a potential transfer, where'as Januzaj was treating it solely as a loan move to gain experience at a top club hoping to play more regularly(stupidly). so once it became pretty clear he wasn't in it for the long term at dortmund they didnt want to waste the squad spots bedding him in and progressing a young player that they weren't going to benefit from?

1545~~~
Obviously there are tons of different opinions on this subject.  However, I have yet to read one that truly encompasses all that has gone wrong with Adnan.

I think there is plenty of blame to go around and each party has had a hand in what I would call an absolute debacle.  In order to understand, we must look at all the facts and be willing to go back to when the player arrived at United.

Januzaj arrived at United in 2011 - since that time he has played for the U18's, U21's, been on the bench and been a part of first team sessions with Sir Alex, David Moyes, Ryan Giggs and LVG, Tuchel and Wilmots.  In his 4 + years with the club he has had essentially 6 managers within United and 2 outside United.  As a young player with a budding talent one of the most important things is structure and repetition - he has had very little of either.  With every manager comes a different message, a different way of playing, different expectations and a different...dare I say, "philosophy."  This is a disaster scenario for a young kid trying to find his feet within one of the biggest clubs in the world.

I watched this kid not even 4 years ago in a tournament called the Dallas Cup - a U19 youth tournament.  He was absolutely bored and miles ahead of any other player at that tournament - this tournament is viewed as one of the best youth tournaments in the world.  Less than 6 months after that he was carrying the United first team - albeit a very poor United first team.

Add to that the fact that kids of this talent need veterans around them to help guide them and make sure that they stay on the correct path.  Well, ever since he became a true first team player, we have managed to get rid of Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Fletcher, Nani, RVP, Chicharito - all players that know what it means to play for United and are ingrained in the steep tradition and expectations of the club.  In all reality, Carrick and Rooney are the only players in the current squad that bleed red - Carrick's role has been drastically reduced and Rooney has had his own issues to deal with. 

I wrote a long winded post in the "direction of the club" thread - and my sentiments written then hold true for this situation as well.  Our club has changed - some might say for the better and some might say for the worse.  We are a buying club in which every player in on edge that we might purchase a player to take their place within the team.  This is a far cry from the Sir Alex days where older players were vested in helping younger players move up the ladder as they knew who would eventually replace them.  The ones that suffer are the young players.

Adnan certainly isn't innocent in all of this either but in the end he is a talented 20 year old that brims with confidence.  A confidence that tells him he could play in any team - this is not abnormal for a young superstar. 

However, I place most of the blame on his "camp" as they have obviously given him very bad advice.  He needs new people within his personal team - he needs someone that isn't afraid to say the difficult things to him. 

Between his camp, the instability within the club and his own personal decisions this thing has become a mess.  I just hope he is able to regain his confidence.  Some of that might come with maturity but some of it is going to have to come from stability and structure within the club.  My guess is that he will be able to add another manager he has played for to his list very soon. 

Not an ideal situation - but also not one that is ideal for bringing youngsters to the next level.

1546~~~
Glad you're not a scout. Jesse Lingard who's ceiling is an Ashley Young type player. No thanks i'd chance things with Adnan every day of the week.

1547~~~
And Adnan can be compared to Adam Johnson in that case...

1548~~~
You should start paying more attention to the youth teams.

1549~~~
Which, ironically, is what Johnson should not have been doing.

1550~~~
Adam Johnson is not a bad comparison tbf. He looked very talented as a youngster

1551~~~
That would've been very naive from Dortmund's side.

1552~~~
Not playing tonight in case anyone still figured otherwise, as per LVG's presser.

1553~~~
ha!

1554~~~
As do.ob has already stated, Tuchel would have gladly given Januzaj minutes to rest other players and therefore, a different atttitude would have changed a lot.

It is common knowledge to anyone who is interested in Thomas Tuchel - and therefore should have been known to Adnan's agents if he himself didn't care about the head coach of the club he chose to join - is that Tuchel accepts nothing less than 100% focus and ambition in training, <i>in particular</i> from players who were either on the bench or not even in the squad for the last match(es).
It's also known that Tuchel feels strongly that players with exceptional talent have the obligation to work hard to live up to it and doesn't hide his anger if players don't meet his expectations.

To me it seems that Januzaj not only underestimated the competition at Dortmund but also didn't know what kind of club environment he was getting into.

It is known that in case of a <i>successful</i> loan Dortmund wanted some kind of 'first option to buy' agreement but it's hard to imagine that Januzaj's camp didn't know about the contract the two clubs have agreed upon - but it was clear <i>from the start</i> that Dortmund had next to no incentive to invest into Januzaj's development.

1555~~~
Pulled out of the U21's squad tonight due to LvG's concerns over his fitness.

Concerning if he seems to be throwing the towel in in terms of development - does he think he's "made it" already?

1556~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2016/Jan/team-news-from-mutv-interview-press-conference-newcastle-united-v-manchester-united-schweinsteiger.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...nited-v-manchester-united-schweinsteiger.aspx</a>

Sounds a bit odd.

1557~~~
Won't ever make it at the highest level with that type of attitude.

1558~~~
Good post, <a class="username" data-user="76770, @bpet15" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/76770/">@bpet15</a>

1559~~~
the guy hasn't played in a month and i believe hasn't even trained since then either as he picked up a small knock. then he was on christmas holidays as per the german league, so it's no surprise he's not ready to be thrown in yet.

i don't think his attitude in this case can be questioned, it's just a matter of him needing to get back into shape. when you're 20, that doesn't take too long so it's not a cause for concern. whether he feels he's "made it already" is altogether different.

1560~~~
And do you think Tuchel's way is exclusive to him? That's how most coaches at big/bigger clubs operate. I'd say the environment at United is tougher than the environment at Dortmund. Januzaj may have underestimated the competition and most likely didn't work hard enough, but if you wanna ignore that politics went into him returning early, you must be foolish. Dortmund just as much thought they could lure him over on a potentially small fee. When it became obvious that Januzaj never had the intention of staying at Dortmund for the long term, they also didn't see the point in investing any energy in him. It was basically Januzaj being lazy but Dortmund also not caring much anymore at some point since it was clear he would not join them permanently.

1561~~~
What would've given Dortmund the impression that Januzaj was available for a small fee? From the looks of it he and/or United didn't want a permanent move last summer and had he done well the potential fee only would've gone up further. And what would "caring" even mean in this context? There were minutes up for grabs for him and Tuchel apparently tried to work on/with him during training sessions. But if someone (apparently) can't really be arsed and wants to leave you let him go. 
It's not even like Januzaj was obviously surplus to requirements in their planning.. as of now they have Castro as their only adequate backup for Mkhitaryan, Reus and Kagawa. Hofmann and Januzaj were replaced by two kids from their u19 and Leitner, who was basically already out the door.

That's a rather funny post. First of all, neither you nor me know if United and Dortmund operate the same way, and that's why I haven't suggested anything alike other than that Adnan may have underestimated the environment of Dortmund. (And you perhaps too.) On the other hand Adnan is a United youth academy product and therefore it wouldn't surprise me one bit if not just his own camp had pampered him but also people at United bar LvG of course.

If you believe that Dortmund thought they could sign Adnan for small fee, you are on the wrong path, mate, as do.ob pointed out already: If anything his price would have gone up but not down. Your post rather suggests that you have no clue how Dortmund operate and tick, which is perfectly fine - why should you as a United fan? -  <i>as long as</i> you don't make claims about them, including calling those users who know one or two things more about their business operations, foolish. In particular when the logic of your <i>small fee</i> claim is the opposite of stringent and how Dortmund treated Januzaj is exactly as predicted the moment he arrived at BVB. Again: Dortmund had no incentive to invest in his development, and honestly: He's not a kid but an adult, and fully responsible for his development and work ethics. It's perfectly normal that clubs demand the very same energy and focus from a loan player, no matter how old he is, than from their own squad. If the loan player cannot or doesn't want to meet expectations so be it. Shit happens, and life goes on for both parties.

1564~~~
Can he play in the Europa League for us or is he cup tied from the loan?

1565~~~
Cup tied

1566~~~
Cup tied, he started for Dortmund in the Europa League.

1567~~~
How do them apples taste? 
Jesse has more ability then Adnan any day!! Trust me this kid will go far.  He can pass, dribble and he's proving he can score.

1568~~~
I do and Jesse is here to stay.

1569~~~
you were saying?

1570~~~
Still on the score sheet and creating chances.  What's your point?

1571~~~
Need to build him up first to play for the U21s ?

Wtf did Dortmund do to him ?

1572~~~
my point is you're annoying, as is anyone who resorts to "seeee!!!! seee, i told you!!!!"

1573~~~
Wut? He had a very average game. He took his goal well but was rightly replaced.

1574~~~
By all accounts his pissy attitude and lack of professionalism did it to himself.

1575~~~
No, what's funny is you thinking Dortmund is some sort of particularly tough environment to handle compared to United. He's played (or mostly sat) a year under van Gaal, who a lot of players complain about being too demanding, at a club that certainly faces more pressure than Dortmund, hence where you don't have much time to make mistakes. I think on that end, last season alone gave him a harsh reality check. Now it's you making claims about a club you seemingly don't know much about either.

And yes, Dortmund had no incentive in investing in his development because they realized he didn't wanna stay. When they loaned him though, I'm pretty confident they loaned him with the hopes of buying him. Look at it from Dortmund's perspective: A relatively young, promising player who is out of favor with the manager at a big club that is investing plenty of money. Their hopes were probably that Adnan would be a solid squad player this year, be happy at Dortmund and demand to be sold to them. We (United) wouldn't have much leverage there and regardless of Januzaj's play would've been forced to give him up for not that high of a fee. Instead though, it became more and more clear that Januzaj was just looking at this as a one year run and was not done at United yet. If Dortmund doesn't operate that way, why else would they loan him? If it was just a matter of adding squad depth because some players are injury prone, it'd be much smarter to add a proven veteran rather than a youngster who hasn't done much in the Premier League.

The loan was stupid on Januzaj's part in the first place. Despite Reus being as fragile as he is, there was too much competition in the first place for an unproven guy like him. One thing I will agree with you on is that he needed to perform and overestimated himself.

1576~~~
As I already told Crossie, Januzaj was out of favor for the moment with van Gaal at United. Imagine him being a solid squad player at Dortmund and deciding he simply wants to stay there? It's not that unrealistic. You get away from the insane pressure a club like United brings and you get away from van Gaal, who isn't too popular with the players and didn't give him much of a chance either.

While I believe Januzaj only viewed the move as a pure loan move, I think if he things had worked out a little better for him, he could've easily wanted to stay permanently. I think in today's football world, we all know that if a player demands to be sold, the fee will not be at market value, which wasn't that high for Januzaj to begin with.

Now I'm not debating that Januzaj wasn't lazy, but I think it's because both parties quickly realized this wasn't gonna become a permanent deal.

1577~~~
Adnan has had better games for United. Sunderland, Newcastle, Hull, Norwich, Southampton, etc.. were much better displays at age 18 than Lingard's matches at age 23. He's also showed more impressive bits of skill than Jesse. No way does Jesse have more ability. That's not a knock on him. Who knows? Maybe Lingard does end up being better than Adnan, but that will only be due to Adnan failing. Adnan has more technique, passing ability, and vision. Jesse so far seems more mature and I think he's always had better finishing.

1578~~~
To be fair, there is a winter break in Germany. He hasn't trained in at least 2 weeks, it isn't that surprising.

1579~~~
In the Adnan vs Jesse debate I believe that Januzaj is definitely a more technically gifted player with more potential. But, until that potential is fulfilled it means F' all quite frankly. We often state how Ronaldo and Rooney were roughly on a par 10-12 years ago but look at the gulf with those two these days.Natural ability counts for nothing unless a player works as well. 

Other than that, welcome back to United Adnan, hopefully your time will come!

1580~~~
It's really strange, because when he arrived at Dortmund, he also had to build up his fitness first despite having a full pre-season with United. When is he actually fit enough to play some football?

1581~~~
Where is he ??? Not on the bench today.

1582~~~
will probably play with the u21s to build "match rhythm"

1583~~~
Starts tonight for U21's.

1584~~~
Hope he plays well.

1585~~~
nice goal already... should have had another earlier in the game as well. has looked really good today.

1586~~~
Is he playing as a 10? Or on the wing?

1587~~~
Right wing.

He's a class above. Hope he can carry this to the first team when he next gets a chance.

1588~~~
He's capable of better performances.

1589~~~
No doubt. But considering the circumstances he's been good. They've resorted to doubling and tripling up on him.

1590~~~
some nice touches and close control. as stated above class above the rest, but he always was in the u21's

1591~~~
2 goals and an assist eh?

1592~~~
it's all thanks to his return to nike boots. completely superstitious, of course, but he was great in nike, rubbish in new balance. let's hope this continues, however flimsy the evidence may be.

1593~~~
He hasn't been wearing New Balance all season.

1594~~~
Got to make the bench for Southampton,surely

1595~~~
those all black boots weren't NB?

1596~~~
Not this season no, been wearing mainly Vapor X academy with I think sometimes Superflys and even a pair of Adidas in pre-season.

1597~~~
Looks grumpy after scoring both goals, give us a little celebration will ya!

1598~~~
Could easily take Lingard's place. We should expect healthy competition there till we'll find someone above U-21 level.

1599~~~
I'd start him. Now that Rooney is performing to an acceptable level the right wing is the biggest problem with our team and he could be the solution.

1600~~~
Any gifs? <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a>

1601~~~
He's a more talented player than Lingard and a better winger and can score goals so I hope he is preferred sooner rather than later.

1602~~~

1603~~~
Our right wing spot is there for the taking at the moment, Lingard is limited, Young is being played as a Wing/full-back and Mata is in dreadful form. Really hope he steps up, a lot more talented than Lingard.

1604~~~
Worth noting that his dribbling didn't come off for the u21s either. Got outmuscled a few times.

1606~~~
Gracias

1607~~~
Want to see him come off the bench today and make a contribution in the same way Depay has been doing recently, give him 20 mins see how he gets on.

1608~~~
#11

What a fecking shame.

1609~~~
Just stick him on from the start, Mata in behind Rooney, and Herrera a bit deeper today, leave Fellaini out.

If we start with Mata on the right, and Fellaini next to Schneiderlin then we know what sort of performance we are going to get before we start, this way at least offers the chance of something a bit different/better.

1610~~~
Hopefully going out on loan may have been a reality check for him. There are so many great talents that seem to believe that their talent is enough. That they dont need to put in an effort.

I think that that is specially the case when they are in our reserves. It is almost like they make an for themself excuse by thinking that the only thing stopping them from becoming a star is faith from the manager. We, the fans, tend to build up under this idea. Right up to the moment were they have played ten-fifteen games and start to struggle.

When brilliant talents like Wilson, who were well used to be a star at all levels, are shipped out on loan and see that they even at a lower level have to give 100 % to be good enough that should be one hell of a reality check for them. And if it is not, they probably lack the mentally ti make it here.

I fear that Janu will be in the latter category. The fact that he insisted going to Dortmund for game time might be just another indication of him having to much faith in his own abilities.

1611~~~
We have a few potentially young players who could be outstanding footballers. The bid issue for me it's pivotal that they have a first team that's playing decent winning football, just helps with transition otherwise the expectation and pressure can be too great. Not everyone can be like Martial, and appears to be unfazed by absolutely nothing.

1612~~~
Hoping to see Januzaj get a run out today. Think he has the creativity and flair to take us to another level. The manager just needs to put him on the right wing and give him a run of games. Him and Martial out wide as inverted wingers would be very fun to watch, in my opinion.

1613~~~
Hope he gets a run out today and doesn't do a Memphis.

1614~~~
Welcome back Adnan. Immediately showing why I believe him to be a thoroughbred idiot. Didn't miss him in the slightest.

1615~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1616~~~
What a return.

1617~~~
Get a fecking grip. Didn't even look a foul for fecks sake.

1618~~~
It was a blatant foul. What exactly did he think he was accomplishing? Ran straight into a player who was going nowhere, totally giving the ref leeway to give a free kick. Moronic.

1619~~~
Eager to impress obviously....should never have been played as a LB for a start

1620~~~
He should have replaced Lingard.. not CBJ

1621~~~
Should be able to give him a zero rating for this game.

1622~~~
Instant impact.

1623~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Did even worse

1624~~~
If he was eager to impress, that once again illustrates his stupidity. He had zero chance of winning that ball. What was he thinking? In all honesty? No chance of winning the ball, his only hope was that for some reason Long (think it was Long?) would knock the ball out. Every chance of giving away a foul, which is exactly what happened. I don't think he's a very intelligent footballer, never have, and that illustrated it in a rather huge way in my opinion.

1625~~~
He had what, two touches, and he is getting criticism? This place is just full of hate, it's incredible.

1626~~~
A sub to forget.

1627~~~
Yep. I won't deny I hate stupid players who give away stupid free kicks. I hated the way Smalling pulled the player back in the penalty area from the corner, lucky not to give away penalty. I hated the way Herrera ran into their player from corner, lucky not to give away a penalty. And I hated that retarded foul that Adnan gave away that led to the goal. As I've said above he had zero chance of getting the ball, and all he did was run into their player. Stupid. Player going nowhere. Brainless, absolutely brainless.

1628~~~
He's not the only player to give away a stupid foul (Looked a dive for me). If you want to blame someone blame the shit marking.

1629~~~
Not his fault McNair decided to lose Austin. Stupid foul but McNair is more culpable for that goal.

1630~~~
Absolutely. The shit marking was the main culprit in the goal, I never said it wasn't. My point was, and is still, I didn't miss the guy. I think he's hugely overrated on here, has a terrible brain on him, routinely making the wrong decisions. The first thing he did when he came back was remind me of what he's like.

When I heard he was coming back, my first reaction was "Oh good. Hopefully he'll play ahead of Memphis now". Having not seen him in a while I forgot how distinctly average at best I think he is. I'd forgotten, to some extent, just how stupid he is. 

Instant reminder.

1631~~~
Err... It was a dumb foul but the outrage against him at this point is laughable.

The very sub was stupid. CWB should have stayed and Adnan on for Lingard... Perhaps already at half time.

1632~~~
It doesn't fecking help that he only got five minutes to try and effect the game. FIVE SODDING MINUTES! This after spending the customary 8 minutes warming up... No wonder he was full of pent up energy and aggression. He comes on with 20 minutes left in the game and he's probably a lot calmer, knowing that he has a lot longer to actually try an effect the game.

Basically, it's not his fault we can't defend a basic set piece, nor it is his fault that LVG is absolutely terrible at making substitutions.

1633~~~
Austin was going down before Adnan even made any contact. 

He also took a shot wide which was quite impressive.

1634~~~
Start him against Derby.

1635~~~
Blaming him is pretty bizarre, it was a shite dive that got rewarded by an even worse referee, followed by absolutely atrocious marking.

1636~~~
Straight back with an assist! Can't really judge him today, we were so bad long before he came on and he never got into the game.

1637~~~
I was out of my armchair when I saw him making that foul but form the replay it is clear how Austin anticipates the foul and goes down before adnan touches him. It's quite poor refereeing imo but if it means LVG is out it's fantastic and Adnan my MOTM.

1638~~~
Did more then anyone in our team did to get van Gaal closer to being sacked so I'm okay with it

1639~~~
To be fair to him Austin completely conned the ref into the FK before Adnan even had time to think. Sadly, no one will talk about the dive, much like no one spoke about that cheating cnut Vardy winning the pen against us last season.

1640~~~
It's all I ever talk about.

1641~~~
LOL Yep.
He only played a few minutes...but what a few minutes. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

In life, you can either blame everybody else for your losses/failures. 
OR you can look within yourself and try and change things to ensure you succeed, in future.
The former is obviously a lot easier to do.

1642~~~
There's very little about the kid that makes me believe he can be a first team player for United, let alone an elite one. He broke into the first team with a couple of good performances and nicely taken goals. From there, the hype was unbelievable. Also, because the sting of Pogba running down his contract and walking away was still fresh, people wanted to label him a world class young talent and celebrate when he signed a new deal. The performances speak for themselves. He flatters to deceive. He obviously has time to improve, but he better do it quickly. I'm not sure he has the attitude and work ethic to make it happen. 

As for today's performance, it was obviously terrible. He gave away the free kick and then decided not to mark anybody when it was taken. He couldn't hit the target late on when he had a chance to tie it up (admittedly, not an easy shot). Simply not good enough at the moment.

1643~~~
Brace yourself, the Adnan fan club won't like that post. I agree completely however.

1644~~~
He was played in a defensive 5 the back. This when we needed a goal.

1645~~~
Because it's a strange post. Not sure how you can agree with it. The hype with Adnan was firstly due to his performances for the youth team where I thought he did even better than Pogba. He had a lot of impressive qualities like technique, passing, and decision making. The first team performances only further strengthened those opinions. The opinion at the time was "this isn't really surprising." He made the step up to the u21 and became the best player in the side and virtually every game he played in. He made the step up to the first team and quickly made himself one of the best players in pre season, which of course means nothing. So when he did the same for the first team in the actual season it was more of a sign that he was the real deal.

The only people that were hyping up Adnan after the Sunderland match and think only the Sunderland match was the reason for hyping him up were people that did not watch him at youth level and people that were the first to claim he was only hyped up due to the Sunderland match.

And today's performance was terrible? He played 5 minutes. Apart from the foul, what is there to judge badly? What is even the point of judging this performance? Just wait until he actually does terrible in a match where he's more involved. I'm sure you'll have the opportunity to say the same thing at that time.

1646~~~
did he come on as a wingback <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
Good to have him back though, missed Adnan.

1647~~~
Myself and everyone else at the ground was happy to see him back.
6 minutes isn't enough to judge him on. Personally, I'm not judging any of our players whilst Van Gaal is still here. Every one of them is capable of better than they are showing and we won't see that until someone else is in charge.

1648~~~
Redcafe is going nuts. Judging him for today's game is a new low. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1649~~~
No, no, he committed a foul. Begone with the kid!

1650~~~
0-0 at home, 85 minutes, desperately in need of a positive change, our, absolute, dip shit of a manager takes off our left back and replaces him with a winger... Only at Manchester United. We truly are unique.

1651~~~
Don't get me wrong, the boy didn't have much time to do anything. It was a short substitute appearance. Unfortunately, it was an extremely poor one nonetheless. Perhaps it's fair to question why LVG didn't bring him on earlier. Personally, I think it's because Van Gaal doesn't trust him defensively. There's no doubt Lindgard works harder in that regard. He only wanted to bring Januzaj on late with a view of trying to snatch a win. It didn't work and, I suspect, Van Gaal's concerns were confirmed. 

The boy has talent, but he's overrated. I obviously want him to succeed, but just don't see it with him yet.

1652~~~
Especially when he really should have been brought on with at least 15 minutes left. It was insane that he came on so late when we should be looking for a winner, and is played deep. Madness.

1653~~~
No one should blame him for anything... I'm happy with people passing the blame to LVG for being a massive fecking idiot.

1654~~~
So is he ahead of Depay in the pecking order now after being deemed not good enough to be part of the squad at the start of the season? More great management from LVG.

1655~~~
I know he was playing in a position he probably shouldn't have been but to give away a free kick in that area of the pitch was just careless on his part.

1656~~~
Blind was the one fouling/pushing Austin and Januzaj didn't even appear to make any contact with him (if he did it was negligible).
At worst you could call it a little naive on Adnan's part but the reality is that a wily striker bought a foul/free-kick in a dead-end situation. If he had hung back and Austin managed to turn Blind then he would have been lamented as well, if they hadn't scored from the resulting free-kick then we never talk about it again. The amount of silly/needless fouls the team gives away and we are focusing on one that wasn't really a foul.

Nice to see him back, no time to make a real impact on the flow of the game but managed to get himself a chance to shoot. Hopefully he gets a run on Friday and we can see how the Dortmund experience has effected him.

1657~~~
The foul was 1 yard from the corner flag, if he'd got the ball not the player it would probably have been a corner. It was a clumsy foul but not in a position where you can blame him for the goal.

1658~~~
Up to that point, Southampton were playing for a draw. They'd got the ball in the corner and they were going to keep it there or play for a corner, free kick. They were just as terrible as we were and had no interest in going for it.

Blame Schneiderlin for losing his man, giving that Championship clogger a free header from point blank. Decent delivery, but it fell in to an area where it should have been easily cleared away.


He was only on the pitch for about 6 minutes, and he at least managed to take a shot at goal in that time, which barely anybody else managed.

1659~~~
Great to have him back. Hopefully he'll add some much needed positivity and directness to our game.

1660~~~
He'll probably be sold to the likes of Swansea in the next year for £4million.

Looking a bit like a Macheda scenario these days.

1661~~~
A talented player who is still very young indeed. He needs game time along with a few others like Depay and Perreria.

1662~~~
Is it strange for me to say I really liked what I saw in that short period. I personally don't like him(overhyped) but something about his application made me feel he looks a fine player. 
Maybe it's because I judge players on their individual progression and don't put everyone in the same box.

1663~~~
Had a really good game for the U21s in case anyone was wondering.

1664~~~
Personally, I was disappointed. Then again, I've hated the idea of him transforming into a winger so I'm most likely biased. I was originally impressed by his passing, vision, technique, and decision making.

Just look at this. Not even close to the same playstyle.

He's not his old self that's for sure but he's getting there, he was showing intent and was looking to actually to take his man on which was what excited me. And I agree with the notion of him becoming a winger, I hated that too.

1666~~~
Yep, we should have ideally developed Januzaj as a #10, or maybe a false 9. Looked a bit lost in those roles, but he was very young. Adnan's best attributes for the reserves were his vision, balance, smoothness, touch of pass, decision-making and eye for threading balls. We should have taken those qualities, and polished them over time to make him more consistent (it's no coincidence that his favorite players - Riquelme and Zidane are more elegant attacking midfielders either). Good #10s take time to develop, and they benefit from consistency and being on the same wavelength as others. 

Instead, we tried to turn him into something he's not - a Giggs prototype who is expected to be fast, beat mean on the outside, make snap decisions which hinder his feel for the game, and challenge his marker consistently. Even though he is coming onto his stronger foot in central areas, playing him out wide is still not the best solution because there's not a lot of productive overlap to make him a threat, and a lot of times he ends up being isolated. Now, to be fair - some players can adapt to those situations; but it doesn't half look like Januzaj has, or can. Which is a pity because he has (or had) the tools to develop into an orchestrator for the attack from central areas.

1667~~~
This is harsh. It wasn't just a couple of good performances in his breakthrough season, he was genuinely our best creative player for a good chunk of the season and was arguably the one shining light of the Moyes era. He created chances when others didn't, beat men when others didn't and was often a threat when others weren't. I don't disagree that he's been disappointing since then, and at the moment I agree that his attitude and work ethic may be questionable, but I feel like he showed enough in that season for us to persevere. He has also never had the benefit of playing in a team that actually knows what they're doing and are confident. If a player like Juan Mata has struggled to produce the goods in our team then it's not exactly surprising that an inexperienced player like Januzaj will too.

1668~~~
I'm not at all suggesting that we give up on the kid. He clearly has some talent. I just think he's a long way off at the moment, and hasn't really done enough to justify the hype. Believe me, I hope he comes good!

1669~~~
Yep, agree completely. Said it back in 2013 that he was definitely a #10. He's not a winger at all. He's not explosive or quick enough. But Moyes and others at the club were too into giving him the #11 and him being Giggs' replacement that they tried to make him a kick and run winger... As a result, he became more selfish, more of someone who tries to run with the ball and go past players and be a proper winger. That's not his game. Keep him as a #10 and let him play those cute passes into the forwards, do little give and go's, and then sometimes run with the ball. When he first broke through, he had really good decision making, looked a very intelligent player, and had excellent technical ability. The longer that season went on, the more he looked like he was being trained as a winger, and the worse he got really. Since Van Gaal came, he only ever played as a winger or left wing back or whatever the feck Van Gaal played him as, and he hardly had a good game.

One game always stuck in my head from that season when he first broke through. Think it was home against Norwich in the Capital one cup. He played as a classic #10 and completely destroyed Norwich. That's the type of player he should have been developed as.

1670~~~
People being wayy too harsh..

Literally came on in the 85th Minute of a game where we were at a shite tempo and after having barely played football for the last few months.

Didn't even do THAT bad anyway, made a couple of runs, more than Lingard did all day.

I think he has to start next game along with Martial, Rooney and Mata/Depay.

1671~~~
Where do you think is Januzaj best position?

1672~~~
He played DMF for like 10 minutes away at Sunderland <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Would be nice if he started against. It's not like Mata, Memphis or Lingard are in fine form!

1673~~~
#10

1674~~~
Out wide or maybe no.10, with a bit more experience.

1675~~~
I think he could do a good job in a front of 3 as a wide forward/winger. However, I prefer to see him as No.10.

1676~~~
I agree. For me, he's a playmaker/creative midfielder, and not a winger/forward. But we're obsessed with turning him into Giggs or Ronaldo for some reason, seeing an overemphasis on his wide play/trying to beat a man, and bulking him up to play as a number 9. It seems we're trying to manufacture him into a certain kind of player when the natural footballer he is, is actually potentially a brilliant one as it is.

1677~~~
Totally agree. We should develop his potential as an attacking midfielder (also with Pereira). I think they have a good vision and they are smart players with a good technique plus the ability of a final pass.
If we play in the future with a 433 formation. Do you think he would be able to play in a midfield of 3? Or what would be his best position in that formation?

1678~~~
#9<span style="color: #ffffff"> (could do a RVP)</span>

1679~~~
I think playing in a midfield three would probably be too dangerous given his lack of defensive abilities. 

I see him as more of an Ozil/Silva type player who will play either as a pure number 10, or a wide playmaker. Whereas last season, in particular, whenever he played out wide, he seemed to try to play more like a Ryan Giggs than those players, with an overemphasis on pace and dribbling. One could argue that he was did dribble a lot in the season under Moyes, and that would be true, but ultimately he's not naturally blessed with excessive pace, and I think he was trying to hard to play like a rapid winger would, and it must have been on instruction.

1680~~~
He desperately need a run of games. I actually feel that, if we played him for 90% of games until the end of the season, he'd make our attacks more aggressive and we'd create a whole lot more. Over the past 8 months he's barely played and I'm not even sure if he's played 3 consecutive games. Writing off a youngster after 5 minutes is incredibly harsh.

1681~~~
Wouldn't mind seeing him as a leading line striker against Derby, seemed to be playing that role in pre season and actually looked pretty good - remember the Barca game?. 

Him and Pereira have a good chemistry and have played plenty together, would love to see a front 4 of Mata, Pereira, Memphis and Januzaj

1682~~~
LF - Martial - RF
--- Januzaj ---
Give him the free role in 4-3-3 system. Its time he showed the desire to succeed here.

1683~~~
Now the bullshit is starting. He's not the solution and a free role to an average idiot like him only goes to show how many FM fans are on this site. You're fantasising.

1684~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Harsh, but I agree.

1685~~~
He did at the start of this season tbf to him, did better than everyone else who has played their since (even though he wasn't brilliant)

1686~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1687~~~
He's not the standard we need but who do we have that is? Tell me genius. The season has been a failure anyway.

1688~~~
I would play him there tbh, he is weak and loses the ball a lot, but at least he tries to beat a man, play a through pass, and shoots. The rest of the no10s don't do most of that, the closest is Herrera and even he has now been converted to a player with no balls who just plays the simple pass most of the time

1689~~~
The way these forums treat young players is actually disgraceful

1690~~~
I wouldn't play him in the free role, But would certainly play him over the mediocre Lingard.

1691~~~
Indeed.

1692~~~
It's OK Adnan, he's just one moron. 

The rest of us love you.

1693~~~
The problem is we can't afford to play him consistently or we could but there is so much pressure on a player to deliver that more consistent players will get the nudge.
If Januzaj was playing week in week out i think he would begin to show what a massive talent he is. Manchester United just isn't a good place to be for a youngster at the moment, there is no well drilled team for them to slot into without huge pressure.

1694~~~
I hope he gets a run. He'll prove his worth, since he's better than all our attacking options except for Martial.

And some people are saying he's weak on the ball? This may have been true in his debut season, but now it's not true at all. His shielding of the ball is excellent, and he has impressive core strength.

1695~~~
Who are these more consistent players, though?

1696~~~
They don't exist

1697~~~
Well, not in terms of creating anything. But in terms of keeping possession and decision making.

1698~~~
I can only think of Mata. Memphis, Lingard and even Rooney are all inconsistent in these aspects. And Mata has been hiding for a few months.

1699~~~
Have peasants pinned somebody to the cross <i>again</i>?

1700~~~
It's Mata i'm thinking about, they are both competing for the RW spot.

What i meant was that when Januzaj is given a few games and he shows inconsistency it's back to the bench, whereas if we kept playing him let's say 5 games in a row it is more likely he would get the confidence and consistency to show what he really can do.
I never feel he has been given a real run under LvG, it has been 1 or 2 games and then back to the bench or in this seasons case out on a loan.

1701~~~
You play janu in a free role when the league is secured and 3 game remaining of the season  - Now we need to gather what's left of this sinking ship and by doing so you play the safest cards on the table. I would even go as far as to bring Charlie Adam in on a loan.

1702~~~
Worked out very well so far

1703~~~
Good God.

1704~~~
this is comprehensively the dumbest post i've read here in a very long time. considering how short the message was, your ability to compress that much poorly founded opinion in the size of a twitter sound-byte would give donald trump a run for his money.

1705~~~
Looking at the message the mods left in your tag will disqualify you from having an opinion on the matter I'm afraid <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Just imagine Blind and Adam operating with their left foot. The highlights would be many.

1709~~~
Wtf? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1710~~~
I reckon it's time to give him a run on the right wing, no one else has made that position their own. If he can even reproduce his first season form then we'll have a threat down both side with Martial on the left. All theoretical obviously but there's no one keeping him out of the side. 

If Rooney at the very least keep his goal scoring up and one of mata or herrera in behind with Carrick and bfs returning then maybe we would see an upturn in our play. Lingard struggles to impose himself consistently and mata simply isn't a right sided player so feck it give Adnan a run, not like our attack can fall much further anyway.

1711~~~
Charlie Adam or Falcao with his flashy iphone and yellow Prada bag, who would you take? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1712~~~
That's the thing, he hasnt been half as good since his first season.

1713~~~
I totally agree but what have we to lose giving him the chance? If we had someone to keep him from getting a chance then fair enough. No harm having someone who can beat a man out there.

1714~~~
You shouldn't expect Adnan to beat players with dribbling.

1715~~~
Why?

1716~~~
He's still a kid. Has anyone been as good under Van Gaal? Maybe one or two. Every winger that Van Gaal has had here has turned to shit.

If you see him for the U21's it is clear that the talent hasn't gone anywhere. I think it's a confidence thing. Stylistically, he's not the right player for Van Gaal, though. Takes too many chances. Fergie would turn him into a world beater.

1717~~~
Theres more then a few average idiots in the squad as it is, Lingard and Fellaini being two of them, Rooney was also suspect for an average idiot before he picked up form. What do you expect from him when he's 1. Played out position, 2. Used defensively when he at his best whilst attacking, 3. Is not backed by the manager thus losing confidence. I wouldnt play him as a #10 just yet, he still needs to develop but to call him an idiot is absurd.
Right now Lingard and Fellaini should not be apart of the first team and should not be apart of the first options off the bench either.

Carrick, Bastian, Pereira, Depay should be the only options off the bench for them positions.

1718~~~
I really haven't been impressed with his ability to go past players. I feel that when he tries to go past players, he ends up losing the ball or just winning a corner at most. Then after he tries to dribble fans start to criticize his decision making. I honestly think that was his only problem with Dortmund. Well that and his lack of defensive work rate, but that was more of a reason for Tuchel to not use him as opposed to something that lead to him getting criticized by the fans.

1719~~~
He has ok ability beating players, doesn't have to pace/acceleration to leave them behind after. Although once he beats his man, he seems to always make a poor decision, like the fact he beat his man somehow sends a rush of blood to his brain and he sees the headlines and tries the impossible shot from the impossible angle.

I'm being harsh, he can beat his man though, not as regularly as some, but to say he can't do it is false.

1720~~~
Januzaj can go past players fine. In his season under Moyes his successful dribbles per 90 minutes was 2.79 and his successful take on rate was 53%. Compare that to Martial this season whose successful dribbles per 90 is slightly better (3.01) but achieved at a worse rate (44%).

His problem, as Cassidy says, is poor decision making once he has beaten his man. That's a legitimate concern but given how nobody else has been able to do anything with the right wing position I think he should be given a chance there.

1721~~~
Only that for the national team and Dortmund he hasnt been close to convincing as well.

1722~~~
You bring up the Moyes season, but I think that's the only year I have seen him beat players with consistency, which is amazing considering he wasn't much of a dribbler prior to that. His dribbling hasn't impressed me since then though and I don't think he should be trying to dribble as often as he tries to at times. I don't think it's anything to do with his technique either as his ball control is really good, it's just that he slows the game down too much and can often get outmuscled or outpaced.

1723~~~
Starting for u21's today, so no chance for him tomorrow then. Unbelievable.

1724~~~
Because Lingard is lighting it up right now, so we obviously don't need him <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>.

1725~~~
Match rhythm bollocks yet again. What about Depay, when is he going to get any game time? What is LVG doing with the youth at this club, why are average Joe's picked ahead of talented individuals. It's obvious, the man out of touch with football, I'd rather we sacked this joke and bring Koeman then to see his face anymore.

1726~~~
Januzaj has probably been dropped for his stupid challenge that led to Southampton scoring their winner. It was brainless play and it cost us.

1727~~~
He could be substituted at half time, LVG may want to assess him, he could still then at very least be a sub for mains

1728~~~
He also saved us a lot that season, especially in the beginning. He is young but clearly has a high potential, he's worth the risk considering our current options

1729~~~
He should never have had played as wing back in those minutes. LVG cost us the game.

1730~~~
not even on the bench, weird

1731~~~
So glad he came back to not play for us either.

1732~~~
Played for U21's last night I think.

1733~~~
Ooooh OK, that makes a lot more sense. He'd probably be better served starting for the U21s than a cameo from the bench for the first team, given he's barely played at all this season.

1734~~~
<b>Manchester United player Adnan Januzaj struggled to make an impact or a good impression at Dortmund.</b>

The 20-year-old couldn't concentrate because he couldn't detach himself from United.

Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel spoke to <i>fourfourtwo</i>.

<b>"A part of him was always still in Manchester and we just couldn't help him cut this umbilical cord.

"He didn't wholly embrace Borussia. He always compared everything with how it had been at United."</b>

1735~~~
Didn't these quotes come out last month? Or did tuchel tell it again?

1736~~~
McMare had nothing to do with it, absolutely nothing at all.

1737~~~
Old quotes.

1738~~~
21 today. Happy birthday and get your shit together, Adnan!

1739~~~
Unfookinbelievable

1740~~~
Relax, I normally don't listen to LvG's bollocks about match rhythm but months of sparing appearances with Dortmund have cost him, he'll continue playing with the reserves for a few weeks then I'd fully expect him to play again.

1741~~~
I love how people are absolutely aghast he's not playing, despite all evidence being that he doesn't deserve to. Wasn't good earlier in season, was dim When he came on against Southampton (albeit in stupid position), and more importantly managed to barely play when in dortmund. But sure, it's a witch hunt by LVG against him. Nothing to do with him not performing on the pitch nor, presumably in training.

1742~~~
He has played 5 minutes as a LB since he came back. If he's been given a second chance, that isn't much of one.

1743~~~
He didn't play as a LB. he was subbed on for a LB doesn't mean he was a LB. when Klopp subs origi for toure does that mean origi goes to CB? Clearly we went all out attack in the dying mins

1744~~~
He played LWB, there is no denying that.

1745~~~
The intention was to attack though. Obviously he has to play in a position but he was in effect a LW. I doubt anyone would bring januzaj on expecting him to play as an actual wingback.

1746~~~
Van Gaal did that and that wasn't the first time either. He's done it before

1747~~~
Not even on the bench. Wasting a potential worldie.

1748~~~
Not necessarily talking about that second chance. I'm talking about how he looked at the start of the season, wasn't great (bar the goal) in my opinion. He then made no impact at Dortmund. And since he's been back .. why exactly does he deserve a run? Maybe he's been utter rubbish in training, that's my point. People haven't a clue, they assume he deserves a chance based on his performances of 2 years ago.

1749~~~
Why did we bring him back only for him to never play?

1750~~~
It's be really sad if we feck up the development of one of the best players to come through our academy in recent times.

Of all the things LVG has fecked this is one that really annoys and angers me. The kid is the real deal and he needs to be nurtured. IF only Fergie was still here.

1751~~~
Same here. 

Sometimes you need to prioritize big talents, with Januzaj in LVG's time, it seems to be the exact opposite.

1752~~~
anyone know the extent of his injury?

1753~~~
You're right. That's why he broke into the Dortmund team and was such a star the....Oh.

1754~~~
I really don't give a flying feck what he did or didn't do for Dortmund. Nor does it make any difference on how highly I rate him which is entirely based on I've seen of him at United.

1755~~~
Januzaj's 'stagnation' falls equally on his own head as much as van Gaals.

1756~~~
I won't deny that but I don't think the way his selection was handled helped him at all. He would often go long stretches without playing at all, then be picked for a couple of games and then disappear again. And when he did play there was no consistency in the positions he payed.

It doesn't help him either that we're not a stable club and getting back to the top is more of a priority than helping young players grow. He was fantastic in the first half of the Moyes season and we followed that up by spunking close to a 100m on Di Maria and Mata who occupied his positions. Not saying we were wrong to do that but it does put more pressure on him. When Ronaldo and Rooney were here they were allowed the freedom to play 90 mins every game because their replacements were rather shite. Januzaj doesn't have that luxury.

1757~~~
Based on what you saw of him 2 years ago .. or since then, out of interest? I could understand it based on his performances when he initially came into the side, but he has been nothing but underwhelming since then.

1758~~~
More so on his own head in my opinion. It's up to him to force the manager to play him. Van Gaal has shown throughout his career that age does not matter, if you're ready, you'll play. If you show it to him in training and follow it up in matches, you'll play. Adnan quite simply hasn't done that I'm guessing. I certainly haven't seen him do much in the matches he's played.

1759~~~
Tbf he doesn't fit into LVG's playing philosophy that much.

It's kind of strange that 3 biggest talents coming out of the academy in that age group re Pereira, Wilson and Januzaj are all stagnating or struggling to get in under LVG while he prefers others who talent wise arguably aren't on the same level.

1760~~~
not playing today in the u21's, but neither is pereira. keane is, however.

1761~~~
So they are preparing for Sunderland? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1762~~~
Also highly likely to do with his injury.

1763~~~
Unless Januzaj has a good season under LVG next year, Van Gaal can only be seen as somebody that failed or mismanaged Januzaj. Possibly even ruined him. I don't think Januzaj has been particularly bad with regards to his attitude, perhaps just a bit unlucky with how things have worked out.

You can't blame the lad for being confident in his ability, if he wasn't then he'd have no chance here. It's how the manager manages these players that makes the difference sometimes.

1764~~~
You don't have the first clue how Januzaj has been with his attitude.

1765~~~
Of course it was Van Gaal who failed / mismanaged Januzaj if he fails. Nothing to do with him not applying himself (we don't know) or just simply not having the ability to cut it at the top level when it comes down to it? Nope, all Van Gaal's fault.

As I said above, he didn't exactly do the business at Dortmund either. I suppose that was Louis' fault?

1766~~~
You have to say that given how strongly you backed him in the beginning...

1767~~~
I'm of the same opinion. The kid was the real deal, LVGs tenure has destroyed him during the most important years of his development.

1768~~~
6 months of football have never made a kid a real deal, if I had to choose a side I would say that LVG knows his stuff when it comes to young players.

1769~~~
To me it suggests that talent is a distant second to the ability to follow the coach's specific instructions. I don't agree with that approach, but it's the only explanation I can come up with.

1770~~~
I stand by that. He had/has the lot and I'd be extremely confident we'd have a very good player on our hands of Fergie was in charge. There's a manager that used confidence in a player to unlock their potential, not beat him up for it.

1771~~~
You're right, but people use his attitude as a reason for his current predicament, when they also know nothing on the matter. I've certainly never heard anything on Januzaj's attitude that I felt was particularly bad, including the stuff from Wilmots and Tuchel.

1772~~~
You don't need 6 months of football to see if someone is the real deal. His performances as a teenager against PL sides should be enough to convince anyone that he has serious talent. Of course, he doesn't fit Van Gaals "philosophy" and he has to suffer for that.

It's painful that lingard starts ahead of him.

1773~~~
Harsh. Lingard has just simply outperformed Januzaj. He makes the right decision more often and this is backed up with his end product.

1774~~~
I find the manager of dortmund who he was on loan with, and his country's u-21 side saying he has a bad attitude pretty illuminating to be honest. What would they have to gain by saying it?

1775~~~
People are in love with an idea of a player we are two years ago. They refuse to see he hasn't shown it in recent times. That's not to say he won't. But they refuse to see that Jesse, while technically more limited, is certainly producing a lot more right now.

1776~~~
I get your point but the ability he showed at times doesn't just go away like that. Don't forget he was our most consistent and best player at the age of 19, almost every time he was on the pitch that season. He still has great potential I believe and based on talent he could certainly make it here. His attitude, work-ethic and desire is perhaps another issue but that will remain to be seen. He needs a manager that will give him a consistent run though and who believes in him that's for sure. Januzaj seems to be the type of player who is dependent on very good management and somebody who be able to boost his confidence. He's at an age now where he needs game-time and a lot of it, whether that's on loan or at United will have to be decided very soon. LVG has to be blamed for loaning him out to Dortmund though, was an abysmal decision that.

1777~~~
Januzaj asked to be allowed to go there.

1778~~~
Van Gaal wanted him to stay in the Premier League. Januzaj was the one who wanted to go to Dortmund.

1779~~~
A man learns something new everyday.. Didn't know that, my apologies.

1780~~~
He's injured

1781~~~
Look it depends on how you look at it. I guess Jesse scoring in his last game should allow him to keep his spot but he was quite useless for the rest of the game. Lingard is doing well but he just doesn't have the quality of Januzaj. 

Whether it was 2 years ago or 3 years ago, the stuff this kid did as a teenager is what very few could ever do. Based on his talent (and having proved it in the past) he should be given a proper run in the starting line up (and by proper I mean in his position).

1782~~~
Maybe because hes starting, and Januzaj isnt?, how is he supposed to produce if he doesnt get any minutes

1783~~~
He got minutes earlier at United and Dortmund, just didnt do anything with it.

1784~~~
How do you rate our young attacking players considering their talent?

In my opinion:

1. Martial
2. Memphis 
3. Januzaj
4. Pereira
5. Lingard

I think Januzaj and Pereira should play more often. Also I hope Memphis gets more confidence and show his talent in order to be important to for us next season.

1785~~~
Passing the ball back at every opportunity, doing jack all for most of the game playing it safe but score/assist, hardly ever taken his man on, is the right decision and what young players should be based on? 
Look at Martial in contrast......

1786~~~
Scored on tour and scored Aston Villa then gets sent away. Great. Philosophy

Jesse in the team because he's tactically a better choice not technically/talent. It's easier for Van Gaal to switch to 352 with Jesse then it is with Januzaj and that's why this whole saga surrounding Januzaj is just bizarre. LVG been here for over 18 months and he still doesn't believe in any single formation to bring out the best of this team. I don't know whether he doesn't trust the players or his own philosophy.

1787~~~
The Dortmund move tells you everything you need to know, LVG told him that he needed to play a lot and he wasn't sure if he could have that playing time at United and therefore offered to go on loan or fight, he decided to go on loan at Dortmund where LVG told him to not go, then Januzaj shows no desire to fight for his place at Dortmund and finally demand the premature ending of his loan. Mentally he isn't ready, he isn't mature and he doesn't want to compete for a place.

1788~~~
Januzaj is a passenger type of player right now. He doesn't come up with enough moments of brilliance to warrant being a passenger. Its like Mahrez, minus all the game changing moments. No top manager wants that in a team.

1789~~~
I may be in the minority but I thought he showed good signs before he was sent out on loan. Played off the striker and played well mostly, was still inconsistent and sometimes weak on the ball, but was also very creative at times too. The loan move however killed his momentum.

1790~~~
if it is good enough for captain undroppable........

1791~~~
Except that almost everything you've said there is supposition. You don't know what LVG said to Januzaj, you don't know what options he was offered, you have no reason to believe he 'showed no desire' at Dortmund (Tuchel's statements suggest the exact opposite) or that he was the one who asked for the loan to end.

I'd say there's actually more evidence for the exact opposite. Everyone who's spoken about him during his time with us has noted his hard work, determination and desire to succeed.

1792~~~

1793~~~
Fair enough, I hadn't seen that first quote. I don't see that you can take anything from the second though (that's LVG, I assume?) He's not saying he told Januzaj not to go, just that it would be difficult to get game time, which everyone knew. It was just a gamble.

1794~~~
There are other quotes somewhere, LVG wanted him to choose an english club with less competition.

1795~~~
He started a few games at the start of the year and didn't exactly stand out, bar his one goal. My guess is that he's simply not showing it in training, whereas at least Lingard is, and Lingard then produces in the matches. Yeah, he's not as technically gifted, but he doesn't give the ball away much, he works hard and he gets into great positions, where he does have a final product. In my opinion Januzaj is still a very bad decision maker, and while he can use his skill to beat a man at times, he'll often choose the wrong option then. It makes complete sense to me why he's not in the side. He shouldn't just be put into the side if he's not doing it in training, especially not based on what he did 2 years ago. He obviously didn't do enough at Dortmund to warrant a place in their side either, yet people lambaste LVG for not playing him.

1796~~~
If we do let him go and waste him I can almost guarantee this is going to bite as in the backside later on. The quality he has shown in the past has been more than what I've ever seen from the likes of Depay, yet Depay is still given a chance here and there.

1797~~~
Dortmund had attacking players in form. Jesse wouldn't have played either in the same position as Januzaj. Januzaj wasn't bad for Dortmund. It's just that the players ahead of him were just better. Also, Januzaj wasn't as much of a hustler on defense so I'm sure that factored into the decision to bench him. As for United, I think Januzaj's play the first 4 games were very similar to Jesse's. It's not like Jesse is outstanding and being dangerous. He's hardworking, and pops up with the odd goal. Van Gaal probably plays him because he's hardworking and doesn't try to do too much. I personally would rather have Januzaj played as I believe he can become a better player than Lingard in the future and I think it's worth the risk. Same reason why I won't give up on James Wilson either. I believe both players showed a lot at youth level to the point where they should not be given up on until they're 23 or something. I have more patience for youth players that showed a lot of potential. They're worth gambling on.

However, it's obviously not up to me so I can only hope Lingard helps us win games for the time being and Adnan eventually gets more chances.

1798~~~
I'm going to put my neck on the line here and predict that he won't actually end up the player we all hope him to be. Whether that's due to poor management of him, or just simply he just doesn't follow on from the promise he showed when he was younger - I don't know.

1799~~~
His attitude is piss poor apparently, at least that is what got reported here and in Dortmund a few times.

1800~~~
He needs game-time in the first team and a good mentor.  We have a dubious manager in the midst of a crisis, who was happy to loan him out last year - Janazaj's watching his formative years tick by with us, so I wouldn't be surprised to see him leave in the summer - would be a waste though.

1801~~~
Which is strange because before playing for the first team, it was the exact opposite. In fact, what I constantly heard was that his father would always tell Adnan that he could always do better even when he dominated in a match. Even in the interview during the 2013 united awards, Adnan said that he thinks he could do better. This after being the best u21 player after just turning 18 years old.

We'll see. I don't think he'll succeed if he continues to emphasize dribbling. If he reverts back to his old style where he kills teams with passing and vision, I believe he will succeed. That's where I stand right now.

1802~~~
Where the feck is he? I really don't want to see the crap Lingard start anymore games at this club.

1803~~~
Cup-tied today. If anyone should be dropped for Adnan after today's performance, it's Mata first. Then Lingard.

1804~~~
Cup-tied and also picked up a knock the last time he played for the u21s.

1805~~~
So, is he injured?

1806~~~
apparently, yes. someone was saying he should be ready for arsenal, though... anyone know anything about that? it was just some random poster in another thread who mentioned it without any source, so who knows.

1807~~~
he's had a really awful 2 years, really gone backwards after his breakthrough year.

so frustrating for us, let alone him

1808~~~
<a class="username" data-user="30035, @GloryHunter07" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/30035/">@GloryHunter07</a> <a class="username" data-user="82770, @caisenma" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82770/">@caisenma</a> (who appears to be a fully signed up Januzaj fan boi)

This is what I was going to post in the derailed injuries thread, which was locked:

In the past 1 1/2 seasons he has shown nothing whatsoever to follow up the hype that surrounded him in his first half season.  He scored 4 goals, 2 of which were in the one game.  He had a marvellous opportunity at Dortmund to show what he was made of and went around like some billy big bollocks telling everyone that he plays for United.

Now, this is the injuries thread, and it is not the place to discuss him, but I am sure that when he is fit he will be given the chance to prove himself.  I hope I am wrong, but I don't expect he will be proving anything to anybody at United.

1809~~~
I don't really see how anybody can say he will or won't make it at present. It's not unusual for a young player to have a bad run of form and he's barely had a look in for the best part of a year. Under the right manager I could still see him becoming a very good player for us.

1810~~~
I think I appear to be a slightly larger Januzaj fan than I in fact am, as a result of my tagline. And it's true, I do come to his defence on here as well. But I'd like to think that i'm somewhat rational and not anywhere near Mad Winger's level of obsession with Kagawa.

With Januzaj, I agree he's had a tough two years. Anyone can use excuses, and I'm usually the first to say that excuses aren't good enough. The best always rise to the top, and for those who don't make it it's either a case of them not being good enough or they didn't have the desire/work ethic to achieve their true potential.

I'm going to flat out disagree with your part about his first season. For any 18 year old to come in and do the job he did on a somewhat regular basis (keeping in mind he won United's player of the month honours on three occassions that season), while having been kept out of the line up for long spells once Mata came in, is remarkable by literally anyone's standards. It's true while 4 goals isn't a lot, he contributed a lot in other areas from assists to build up, etc. I don't think I need to explain myself here, because you won't find more than a handful of people that would disagree with me when I say he had a strong first year.

Last season he wasn't remotely the same player. He looked bereft of confidence and his poor decision making was incredibly frustrating. Was this a case of second season syndrome or LVG's tactics? Maybe a bit of both, nobody can say for sure. But it is safe to say he wasn't good enough, and certainly didn't resemble the player from the year before.

This season has been weird. He started four matches and did... ok. Maybe a 6/10? But then again, the whole team looked poor and we know how the rest of the season has gone since then. Especially in regards to Adnan not having played for us for more than 5 minutes since August.

It's clear (I hope!) that LVG will be gone in the summer and it will be a new start for a lot of players. Januzaj just turned 21 and as long as he has the work ethic and mindset to reach the extent of his potential, I think we can have a really good player on our hands. 

But like most players, people often are too quick to say "oh he's shit" or "OMG he's going to be our Messi". There's an in-between area, and it's not all bad in there.

1811~~~
I'm still trying to figure out if the perception of him had a lot to do with that season under Moyes and how bad things got.

Januzaj clearly has talent but there is just something lacking, I can't put my finger on it.  Whether it's attitude or the way he's being trained, he just seems to lack that focus or extra bit of skill that would make him the complete player a lot of us were expecting.  Ever since those first few games he played, he has gone backwards and looks discouraged/pissed off.  His skill set doesn't seem to be showing any kind of progress and his composure in the few games he's played has often been poor.  So I'm not sure if we're overrating Januzaj or by how much.  Pereira is a good comparison.  He's almost the same age as Januzaj and looks much more assured in the few games he's played with the first team.

1812~~~
This guy becomes a much better player when he's not playing.

1813~~~
I don't think the perception has anything down with Moyes or how bad things got. He genuinely was excellent for that few months when he first got into the team. It wasn't about the highlights but the general level of his play. He seemed like such a clever player consistently making the right decisions on the pitch. He seemed to have great vision and really good sense of what was going on around him. This along with his dribbling and lovely weight of passing made it look like all he needed to do was get a bit stronger and nothing would stop him.

His form since has led to a lot of people rethinking his early form and wondering if they just imagined it. Others have decided to pretend he never played that well in the first place. I find this all a bit strange. Perhaps people just find it difficult to reconcile the early performances with the more puzzling ones we've seen since. This is understandable because he's been a very different player. For some reason his judgement and decision making seen to have completely gone. It's very hard to understand why. I watched him take about 15 shots in an U21 game a few weeks ago. Most of them made no sense.

I think the club need to work on him and figure out what's going on in his head. Perhaps it is a confidence thing. When he first started he seemed the calmest player on the pitch. These days he always seems to be trying to hard to make something happen. The foul against Sunderland is a perfect example of this.

1814~~~
He's still very young. I am not going to predict where he'll reach in his career. What I do know is that he has the natural talent to be a top player, and hope he works hard enough to get there.

1815~~~
Not really how it works.

1816~~~
I think he played so well under Moyes because of the way the team was set up. Moyes, didn't really give any sort of tactical instructions or had any sort of structure in attack for his players. This was a great environment for Januzaj to use his instinct and talent to just go out and play and flourish. The problem is, most top managers will have tactical roles for their attacking players and will have them follow patterns and movements within the system. 

This is where Januzaj seems to struggle. He cant deal with a tactically disciplined role where he has a responsibility to do a job. This is especially noticeable under Van Gaal and is why he failed at Dortmund (Their attackers all have roles to fill). Its up to Januzaj to start working on flourishing under a tactical responsibility and unless he does, he will never be a top player.

1817~~~
Thought he did well when he came on today. Maybe it was because of the whole feel of everyone today, but he showed confidence in the brief time he had and had good moments. Hopefully he can see all the others taking their chances and get some belief back that he can do the same.

1818~~~
We are playing more open in attack right now which should help him compared to sideways pass ball we were playing earlier.

1819~~~
LVG has given several players a lot of freedom to do their own thing. Di Maria last season and Memphis this season for example. To get the best out of Januzaj, he needs to be given the ball and be told to take responsibility for creating something (and do a decent job defensively). I still think he's a huge talent but he really needs a manager that believes in him.

In terms of performances, Januzaj has been no worse than Mata, yet one starts almost every game while the other gets to sit on the bench and sent out on loan. Buying Mata was the worst thing that could happen for Januzaj and hasn't helped United in the slightest.

1820~~~
Showed flashes of why we're so excited by him today, that bit when he ran rings around most of Arsenal's defence at once was utterly mad.

1821~~~
Aye. Looked confident today. 

Still think he's the best attacking talent (bar Martial) at the club.

1822~~~
Decent cameo.

1823~~~
Hopefully he'll get more chances and minutes!

His talent is so obvious it hurts not to see him play more.

Fanboi/

1824~~~
Did well, held the ball up and turned Arsenal around.

1825~~~
I don't really think Mata has been the worst thing for him and I think they could play well together. The worst thing has been the style of play. Slow, turgid stuff where he always got the ball at a standing start and was expected to try take on a man which isn't his game. Just like Memphis, we can see a huge difference now that their is some tempo and movement in our play and they aren't just given the ball wide and expected to do something with it on their own. Adnan fits right into this style and would link up great with Mata, Memphis etc. This trying to mould him into a high flying winger Giggs reincarnation has been the worst thing for Adnan's development as he just simply isn't that player and it is madness to expect him to be.

1826~~~
Didn't stop running when he come on, both closing players down and running the channels to provide an outlet for us. His contribution was very important and what we needed in that period of the game.

1827~~~
If he had the hunger and determination of some of our other young players he'd be in the team every week. Hope he can sort his head out and reach his potential.

1828~~~
Did okay for me, almost like he was trying too hard to prove something because he kept battering everyone around him and giving away a free <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ..

Us sitting back more didn't help his attacking cause.

1829~~~
Thought he was good today. Ran hard and can clearly make things happen. Please let the rest of this seaosn work out for him

1830~~~
Maybe I'm a fanboy but I'm just convinced this kid can be a worldie. Something about him makes me happy

1831~~~
Loved the  pass to Mata who wasn't able to pick out Memphis. Was with the outside of his foot I think. 

I think the kid has all the ability in the world. Give him more chances.

1832~~~
Van Gaal said this when discussing Depay the other day 
“I have never given up on him, nor have I given up on Adnan Januzaj either because I recognize their quality and their talents.But they have to cope with the Premier league and we help them every day to develop themselves so they can cope with the Premier League."

1833~~~
Completely agree. Even if he had the technical skills for the role, he simply does not have the pace to be a Giggs-type player. He's a 10, or a wide play-maker drifting in from the right a la Mata.

1834~~~
I'd play him on the right and rest Lingard on Wednesday who looks shattered.

1835~~~
He should get a run in the league since he's cup tied for Europa.

1836~~~
Agreed.  The sky is the limit for Adnan but only if he sorts himself out.  Maybe he has already.

1837~~~
I think this horny football would suit him more.Can see him given a start soon.

1838~~~
Anyone got a gif of him going past 3 defenders or so near the left flank corner? That was amazing.

1839~~~
That's what I'm hoping for, he'd add a fresh threat to the forward line and Lingard certainly looks like he could use a rest, the squad is so thin it makes sense to filter in 1 or 2 changes when possible to try and avoid wearing out the players we have left.

That vid shows so much quality. The way Fosah-Mensah steals the ball, Januzaj going through three players and then Mata's little flick. wow

1843~~~
He has a second chance and Manchester United is a club that takes care of all our players and I think it’s a very good habit to have that. I believe in the talent of Adnan Januzaj. I said it would be very difficult to play matches in Dortmund and unfortunately I was right."

hmm, but somehow our own youngsters pulisic and leitner get their minutes and games..
i trust in tuchels words: "januzai hasnt been here realy."
there was a lack of commitment and effort.

1844~~~
The Dortmund loan was an odd affair. I hope Adnan has learned from it and realised the level of hard work and determination required to really hold down a first team place in a top side.

I thought he did well against Arsenal and want to see more of him during the remainder of this season. If he plays well he could easily displace Lingard or Memphis in the side.

1845~~~
Since it was only a loan Dortmund didn't have as much incentive to play him. So no point in comparing him to those youth players.

1846~~~
the point is, that we need players. and the aim of our playing is to have no a-team or b-team (like in the stoneage), we want a totaly versatile squad where nobody can imagine how the next 11 players are.
and for this, he had a lot of chances to break into the start-formation. but he missed this possibilities. and tuchel explained why.
in comparison anybody can see: there would had been place for him to start (if he offered something more in the training). now a leitner and a pulisic grab this possibility.

1847~~~
No they don't, they both have played under 200 minutes all season. Adnan actually played more than both of them combined. As had been mentioned loads of times too, Adnan wasn't Dortmund's player so they had no reason to try and develop him.

1848~~~
yeah,but maybe if he had offered more, we would have bought him.
tuchel was very disappointed about him. a lot of people was.

it was a lost of time. for him,for united, for us. and thats only cause he didnt grab the possibility (with every energy he has) to learn a lot, and play a lot, in one of the best teams in europe. a pity.

there is a german phrase for this: it was "weder fisch noch fleisch"

1849~~~
At 14 mins 20 secs of MOTD 2's highlights of the game, 4th official Mike Dean, pats Adnan Januzaj on the bum as a sign for him to run onto the pitch mid-substitution.


Bizarre.

1850~~~
Gabriel is a clown <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fell 2 times on his arse when he tried to tackle Januzaj

1851~~~
Judging by LvG and Tuchel's quotes he was never your's to buy.

1852~~~
Just when he was starting to come back, he gets dropped from the squad. Only played 60 minutes a couple of days ago... Is he injured again?

1853~~~
He played on Monday night for the reserves, probably getting rested.

1854~~~
I'd like to see Januzaj get maybe 4-5 consecutive starts to build his confidence. He was possibly the best outfield player in Moyes season and suddenly under LVG he was not starting games, he was being given 5-10 minutes to prove himself and with ADM bought, his only way to win LVG was to show his talent by scoring, and that led to poor decision making that season and even this season, Mata was being used there, so he is just trying too hard due to his insecurity, and I'd like Giggs to put an arm round his neck and say that he is a player who can be trusted

1855~~~
he was pulled on 60 minutes, i believe they even said it was planned ahead of time that way so that he'd have gas in the tank for watford. regardless, it doesn't make any sense for LVG to prioritise the u21's for adnan and pereira if it means they don't even get into the matchday squad.

1856~~~
He should be given a go on the right in place of Lingard.

1857~~~
Agree, should be given an extended run now back in the team in place of Lingard, he's had his chance to show what he has got now give Januzaj a chance to prove he can get back to where he was.

And let's not forget where he was, all you have to do is watch his highlights from the Moyes season to see he was absolutely phenomenal at times.

The closest thing to Ronaldo since Ronaldo himself was thrown out quite a few times.....

1858~~~
I've been watching him closely for a while now, and was a big fan of his, but now I must say I think it's looking less and less unlikely that he will be this great star that we thought he would be. He just lacks that power, pace and most critically, that cutting edge to be a true winger. He lacks the presence and poise to be a no. 10 and he's no midfielder. 

Last season he mostly infuriated fans by losing the ball or taking too much time on the ball or making a poor decision like going for goal. Call it nerves or what have you, but his footballing intelligence simply did not show last season at all. This season, in what little we have seen of him, we see a more composed, relaxed and possibly refined footballer. But completely absent is the power, pace and cutting edge required of an attacking player. 

Compare to Martial and Rashford. Or even Lingard, who despite his faults, oozes confidence and determination. Januzaj is not confident, and made the moronic move of insisting on going to Dortmund to sit on the bench for a few months. 

Basically my point is, Januzaj has not progressed at all in the 3 seasons we have seen of him. He went from hugely promising, to being nonexistent and a non-entity even when playing. We have not seen even a glimmer of his initial outstanding form.

1859~~~
He really should have gone to a club of a lower level where he'd be in the starting 11. This season has been a complete write-off for him, and he's probably looking at another loan next season when we sign a RW. Completely wasted a year of his career.

1860~~~
Hopefully the last few years has been a reminder for him that he still has a lot of Work to do.
Luckily he only just turned 21 so all is far from lost, a good loan next season could turn everything around for him.

Should we let him go on a permanent transfer? Hell no, when he came on against Arsenal you could see right away the ability he has.
What he needs right now is a manager who trust in him, even when he is having a bad game. I still believe he can turn it around and become a good player for us.

1861~~~
It's true that the move was silly. But I'm pretty sure Januzaj will go much further in the game than the "oozing of confidence" Lingard. Rashford is a bit of an unknown quantity since the sample size is so small so I'm not prepared to rate him at Januzaj's level in terms of ability/potential yet. Yes he's had a period of indifference after a blistering start but he still remains one of the most talented footballers at the club and yet be a huge player for us.

1862~~~
How has he been performing for the U21's?

1863~~~
Also I don't think he lacks that much. As a number 10 hes definitely got a good bit of presence and poise. He's worked a lot on his upper body strength and that has been evident in the football he's played as a 9 over the last year. I mean let's face it. David Silva isn't exactly an ox now is he? Poise? Can't think of anyone at the club who has more than him. Maybe Mata but he's frail as a grasshopper. One thing Januzaj does have is the technical quality and poise. Barring really bad days it always shows. What he needs to work on is end product and most importantly that intensity to his game that demands to be involved in the game. Like a lot of the young players he drifts in and out of games. And as a 10/playmaker you have to constantly be available for the pass. I think he's caught between being a forward and a playmaker. But the raw tools are not lacking for me. Definitely not for a 10.

1864~~~
In an ideal scenario long-term Januzaj will be a 10,Pereira will be a 8,Rashford right winger/striker and Lingard to cover for all the 3 attacking positions.

1865~~~
You "saw something"? What exactly? Him showing off some tricks for about a minute in the dying minutes of a game that had already been won by his younger and vastly less experienced peers? Great lets sign up some futsal players for our squad.

The lad has more bookings for diving than goals for United.

He was our most promising prospect in 2013-2014 I agree with that but he has gone a mile backwards since.

Martial Depay Lingard and Rashford are a class above him now and that is a shame and Januzaj has only himself to blame for that. 21 is not that young anymore. I hope he sincerely regrets going to Dortmund and will now get his act together. He isnt the young starlet anymore.

1866~~~
Its all to do with his mentality. Having such an explosive start has gone to his head and he thinks he has made it already. United need to show him some tough love and not pander to his ego. If he rises above and comes out better then you will have an amazing player there. If he doesn't, he was never going to make it at a club like United.

1867~~~
Agreed

1868~~~
He is going to be great. We have to make sure it is at united.

1869~~~
What i meant was that when he plays you see that he has the talent. He has the vision, passing, dribbling etc. But he needs to play more maturely, think faster, release the ball quicker, move into Space.
If it all comes together for him he will be a quality player, it's all up to him though.

1870~~~
Love that bit of skill from Mata

1871~~~
During Moyes season Rio hinted he started crying when not selected at one time

1872~~~
Give him a few starts and he'll be fine.

1873~~~
i can't see a way back for him anymore, as long as lvg is here anyway. with all our injuries, he wasn't even on the bench last match for fecks sakes. 

nevertheless, it's as gol123 said:

"It's all to do with his mentality. Having such an explosive start has gone to his head and he thinks he has made it already. United need to show him some tough love and not pander to his ego. If he rises above and comes out better then you will have an amazing player there. If he doesn't, he was never going to make it at a club like United."

1874~~~
Tbh I don't think that Januzaj looks great in this scene. Initially he had plenty of space and Arsenal had zero defensive organization or discipline. He could've easily turned around and passed it to Mata who then would've had plenty of space. Instead he just kept going by himself and literally backed himself in into the corner and when the opposition caught up to him he didn't try to waste some time or win his team a corner, instead he tried a showpiece dribble through two defenders.

1875~~~
Yet we were all complaining about too many passes and not enough risks during the first half of the season. Don't think most fans actually know what they want.

1876~~~
Mentality wise he's not there yet but that's something that could come with age. However, I just don't think he's this huge talent everyone says he is. He's a good player but he doesn't excel at anything, that coupled with his attitude could mean he never makes it here. I see more ability in the likes of Pereira and I think in five years time Pereira will be the better player. He told LVG he was a number 10 and so LVG gave him three or so starts in his so called "best" position and he failed to impress.

He got shunted off the ball on a number of occasions and our play broke down because of his inability to shield the ball or make a quick pass. After those performances he quite rightly got sent out on loan, but again his attitude or ego, call it what you will meant that he went against the coaches advice of moving to a smaller club and decided he could break into a supremely efficient dortmund team. Unfortunately, LVG was proven right in his assessment and he couldn't make it there and has kind of had to come home with his tail between his legs as the loan was cut short.

Like they say, hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.

1877~~~
Not performance related but, still thought I'd share. Red carded a fat guy in a charity 5 aside game lol

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/man-uniteds-adnan-januzaj-refs-7490065?ICID=FB_mirror_MF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/man-uniteds-adnan-januzaj-refs-7490065?ICID=FB_mirror_MF</a>

1878~~~
Should be sent off for his name alone.

1879~~~
What? It was the 89th minute against Arsenal and his team was leading 3:2. Not exactly a situation where your team is looking desperately for a goal.

1880~~~
Yeah it was his choice to go out on loan regardless of club, let's give up on Wilson as well while we're at it. Rashford already worlds apart lol give me a break

1881~~~
All of our players were doing that, to waste time.

1882~~~
Should loan him to Leicester as part of a deal for Mahrez. Win win for us.

1883~~~
Nice poll at the end of that link.

1884~~~
aside from everything else, he falls in that place like many players at the club at mo, what's his best position? He too slow to play in the wing, not built to play centrally. I think like many players with his skill set, needs to find a league like Spain where time and space allows for players like him to express himself.

1885~~~
Mahrez is the player I pictured Adnan becoming. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>... Still young I suppose.

1886~~~
I think he's the most talented player that has come through our academy in recent years, but unfortunately it looks like all the early fame and big money got to his head. He is still very young and hopefully he can mature and turn it around.

1887~~~
Rio didn't say who was crying.

1888~~~
correct, it might have been Evra

1889~~~
It's probably Januzaj but it could also be Zaha.

1890~~~
Zaha never played all season. Don't see a reason for him to be upset at not being included.

1891~~~
I would have agreed with you if it wasn't the end of the game where he was just trying to waste time. The defender fell, which he noticed and tried to get something out of it.

He doesn't lack the poise to be a no.10. His problem when he played there was difficulty finding the right space so he could be more involved. He can get that with more experience. He looks a lot more comfortable in that position than on the wing where he tries to get by through dribbling alone these days.

Ehh not quite. Martial certainly is and Depay has done more. Lingard and Rashford are not a class above him. Sorry, but they're not.

1892~~~
He said it was a 19 year old didn't he

1893~~~
Can't remember the exact quote but remember the context. I'm pretty sure it was Adnan

1894~~~
Mahrez and his play style are quite similar.

1895~~~
He did said that, Januzaj it is then, I think Zaha was twenty.

1896~~~
Pretty sure hes not In the squad again today. Jeez. If he cant get a look in now, he wont ever again. LVG has closed the door.

1897~~~
If this is true I'm seriously disappointed in LVG yet again. We all know that this kid does have the ability to make it big at the highest level - he deserves to be at least on the bench for that.

1898~~~
Obviously he's needed more for the U21. We have Fellaini back now.

1899~~~
I've lost all hope. Look at this starting eleven. Is this the quality he couldn't get ahead of? He will probably be sold in the summer. We will regret this.

1900~~~
fecking Weir made the bench ahead of him and Pereira ?

Nothing against Weir but cmon.....


He will be sold if somehow LVG stays on and might be anyway. And we will regret it soonish.

1901~~~
He will be if Mou comes in unless he works harder on defense.

1902~~~
He's obviously going to work harder in defence not making the squad, its a great idea. Marvelous LVG. Philosophy. Oh Pereira needs to work harder in defence too. Perfect. Or maybe let's just destroy the living souls out of these 2 and take away all their potential and flair until their nothing more than average players playing for a average team with average goals in mind.

1903~~~
Mission accomplished!

1904~~~
Scored two goals today in United's U21 4-0 win. No place for that sort of production on the first team.

1905~~~
So him and Pereira weren't injured like some suggested when they weren't on the bench yesterday.

1906~~~

1907~~~
Bloody hell, were they playing on a local park?

1908~~~
Carrington

1909~~~
Hopefully van Gaal actually fecking uses him this week.

1910~~~
Start the fecker vs West Ham.

1911~~~
I'm now sort of wishing that they stay away from Van Gaal's toxic influence. If he and Pereira bide their time there is no way the next manager is going to overlook them, given how impressive they are and the fact that 'giving youth a chance' is a condition precedent to getting the United job.

1912~~~
Needs to start some fecking games.

Get Lingard out of the team and give Januzaj a fecking go.

1913~~~
Mourinho won't use them. Not under any circumstance.

1914~~~
I can't believe how he's just being ignored.

It can't be his fitness levels. Fellaini comes back after a month, and he gets to play the full 90 minutes. This "red zone" bullshit is just an excuse for LVG to play his favourites. And even if his fitness levels maybe aren't 100% there's absolutely no reason for him to not at least make the bench.

Say what you want about Januzaj, and I agree he can sometimes be frustrating, but he is also one of our most creative players, which is a very useful trait in a team that has 1 chance per game.

1915~~~
He wasn't eligible yesterday.

1916~~~
Maybe just maybe, there is a reason he is not starting games and wasn't for Dortmund. He is just not all that.

1917~~~
How good he'll be in the long term is debatable.

What's undeniable is that as a winger he's shown more in the EPL than Memphis, Lingard and Mata. For that reason alone he should be getting  minutes.

1918~~~
Right, forgot about that. Hopefully he gets a chance in the next game.

1919~~~
well he's playing u21's today, so i don't expect him to be anywhere near the bench for sunday. he scored two goals for the u21's on monday as well, so any more of that and he may as well close the books on the senior team for this year. we can't be having that sort of thing around here.

might i also add, that if adnan got the sort of chances that depay has got this year we'd probably be a lot better off for it.

for all the flack some give januzaj, the guy has played less than two full matches worth of minutes in the premiership this season - including the matches he played in before his loan to dortmund.

ridiculous.

1920~~~
If Adnan had gotten anywhere near the number of chances Depay has got, he would have made the position his own. Instead what has happened since lVG has come in that he's either been frozen out completely or starts a couple of games in a row and then is not seen again for a couple of months. When he does play he plays in all sorts of weird positions.

He's been treated appallingly by LVG. Just hoping Mourinho does a lot better with him but I'm not holding my breath.

1921~~~
Yeah the Dortmund thing proved that the players in front of him were playing better. That doesn't mean he was bad for Dortmund. Well it also proved that he wasn't as hard working on the defensive side that Dortmund required. United don't have players in the same form as Dortmund had. When players who constantly put in crap performances continue to get game time your comment doesn't excuse his lack of chances.

1922~~~
Its funny that Januzaj plays as well as Pereira every game while playing in reserves, or maybe even betters him, atleast as per reports, and still people cry out loud for Pereira to be included because he's the next big thing, while Januzaj is not

1923~~~
Januzaj at least got a loan (as shitty as it was). Pereira was refused that. I'm still livid at the treatment of both, fwiw.

1924~~~
Needs to f*cking start vs West Ham.

If he doesn't then just what the actual f*ck.

1925~~~
This is the reason LvG being hailed for youth is bullshit.  Lets face it, it's not about who deserves their chance and who needs first team games to develop, it's about who gets lucky from others being injured.

1926~~~
Be surprised if he's even on the bench, he played 90 minutes for the u21s last night.

1927~~~
He got the injury in between but why is so unfit? He's been training with Dortmund all season and played a few games too. I just hope he does well under the next manager. Always get the feeling LVG doesn't like him.

1928~~~
I don't have anything against Weir but seeing him get on the bench ahead of Januzaj and Pereira is pure ridiculousness.

1929~~~
I've no hope for Januzaj under Van Gaal. He's only going to play him as a striker or some stupid shit like LWB so he'll never come good. If Van Gaal is still here next season then Januzaj and Pereira are done at United.

Januzaj has lost so much ground under this fraud.

1930~~~
I really don't rate this kid. The reason why he doesn't get played imo is because he's extremely unreliable. The basics of his game such as knowing when to pass, tracking back, off the ball movement and not losing the ball is almost non-existent.

To make things worse, he always tries to play for himself and not the team. You see him run into blind alleys trying to take on 2 or more defenders and also shooting from range all the time. I wouldn't really have a problem with this if he actually did have the pace and trickery to take on multiple defenders or if he actually scored from his long shots but he doesn't.

I agree he has talent as we saw that in the first half of 13/14 but he still has a long way to go. The new contract, the No.11 shirt, the media hype and the fan fare over what international team he would play for has all gotten to his head and he thinks he's better than what he is.

He can turn it around with application, hard work and listening to his coaches but I personally wouldn't be surprised if he ends up having a career playing for the likes of Fenerbache and PSV.

1931~~~
We've got experienced pros that are supposed to be some of the best around that look shit under Van Gaal. I'd hold off on writing Januzaj off until we have a decent coach that uses him like Moyes did. Van Gaal seems to want to do everything but that, in an effort to better Moyes and be hailed as the one that made him. Clearly he can't do that and has cast him aside a bit in favour of less talented youngsters where there are potentially more personal accolades for Van Gaal to earn.

1932~~~
He needs a run of games. He can't be expected to settle into a team with the odd final 10 minutes of a game. Same goes for Pereira.

1933~~~
Are you sure you didn't mean to post this in the Memphis thread?

1934~~~
If if was just Van Gaal I'd be inclined to agree with you but Tuchel and Wilmots have also been unimpressed with him. I've actually not wtitten him off completely, I'm just a bit baffled when I see people outraged at him not being in starting line ups as he's been poor for about two years now.

I did think this while typing tbh. I guess that's another thing going against Adnan. Having Memphis and Januzaj in the same 11 is a recipe for disaster. Two brainless primadonnas losing the ball at every opportunity.

It has to be one of them and I would choose Memphis.

1935~~~
He's in the squad for tomorrow.

1936~~~
He has the ability.

He needs a manager who believes in him and gives him the run he deserves in the role he suits.

I'm not prepared to give up on him that easy.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vgI56dEUmxo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1937~~~
Him and Perreira are the 2 players well above those in the reserves, but get no game time. The Looney Van Gaal philosophy way

Looney Bin has destroyed most of the senior team , who got progressively worse every match they play. He gives average youth players chances, whereas for the future Januzaj and Perreira are the most talented, but have had 2 years in a very important stage of their development wasted

Lingard and the rest are not the future, they will all be on bench or sold

1938~~~
Honestly, just watching this again, he was f*cking great...

1939~~~
FFS, we actually played better football under Moyes, at least more ambitious in attack....

1940~~~
It's a shame because he was never like that until Moyes came. Maybe he was instructed to take players on because the coaches want to make him a winger like Giggs or something. Or maybe the dribbling success he had under Moyes makes him believe he can recreate that. I'm not sure

1941~~~
At least we got the ball wide and crossed it. We just pass it back inside anytime we get to the byline now <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1942~~~
No clips there of his game against Newcastle at St. James which I was at. He came on early for Young I think who busted his hand from memory. He played so well that day and got a sweet goal.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/u8lq" width="560"></iframe>

1943~~~
I remember that game.

My point is, he is a fantastic FANTASTIC prospect.

That's been forgotten a lot due to recent bad form under Van Gaal, forgotten way too easily.

Played right he could be our best player.

1944~~~
I'm confident he'll make it, first step is to get rid of this shit manager.

...Hell, even Mourinho was throwing him praises back then.

<i>“He is a fantastic player. He is not 18 - he is 25. He is so mature and comfortable. A very good and important player.”

“I just think he is a very good player with the great conditions to have a great long-term career,” he added.

“I don’t know the boy individually, but it looks like he has the lot.”</i>

1945~~~
Apologies, I wasn't having a go at you. It just triggered my memory of that Newcastle game.

1946~~~
I remember that game, we played some beautiful attacking football and to say that was under Moyes. That game was better than anything LVG has put out so far.

1947~~~
We played decent footy under Moyes, an extension of SAF where the players could still express themselves (No doubting he was an absolute twerp of a man though). Much better conditions for Januzaj to play in than what we have at the moment.

1948~~~
I didn't take any offence, didn't mean to make it seem that way.

I was just reminiscing like aahhh yeah i remember that game, better times with Januzaj <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

I'm confident once Van Gaal leaves the real Januzaj will come back.

Then watch our frontline of Januzaj, Depay, Martial and Rashford blossom.

1949~~~
Januzaj is back in the squad for tomorrow. Any chance he starts?

1950~~~
In true tagline fashion...

1951~~~
I hope he can get his mind right because he <b>is</b> a great talent.

1952~~~
Just start him ahead of lingard.

1953~~~
Don't think he'll start again under Van Gaal. Much has seeped out about his loan and looks like he pissed the boss off and he wanted rid.

1954~~~
That front 4 (Hernandez, Mata, Kagawa and Januzaj) only played because he was resting players for the Champions League (Mata was cup tied). All 4 were outstanding. It was an excellent performance and one of the best under Moyes. Like most of the good things that happened under Moyes it was more through luck than judgement.

1955~~~
I see people say this so often, and I always ask, why does he deserve a run?

1956~~~
The video is sort of my reasoning for it.

Look at the form he was able to produce when he was in the team regularly and played in a role that suits him.

He destroyed teams.

That's why he deserves a shot.

1957~~~
No he didn't

1958~~~
Bit of an overstatement but he made several teams and several players look very foolish.

Easily our player of the season.

1959~~~
No he wasn't.

1960~~~
He'll get the injury time if he's lucky.

1961~~~
Quite a sexy front four, some nice interplay too <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1962~~~
There were large periods where everybody was saying that we were being carried by an 18 year old. Obviously didn't win senior player of the year for us that year, but he was important. 

I don't get why so many are trying to downplay his form that year. Obviously there is some angle that people have which means giving Januzaj any recognition isn't possible.

1963~~~
Fecking hell, look at that. All that space being made in the final third, more than 1 player at a time making runs, fast paced counter attacks. You know things are bad when you're feeling nostalgic for Moyes football.

1964~~~
He showed glimpses but no more. He completely fell off the rails in December and you could legitimately count on one hand his good performances since then. That was 2 years ago.

1965~~~
All these people saying he basically did nothing will be the first to jump on his dick if he starts getting another run and playing well.

1966~~~
No he didn't.

1967~~~
It was a lot more than glimpses. You don't get International teams falling over themselves for you, given a nice new contract at United along with the no.11 shirt off just glimpses.

He was a bit like Martial, in a way, where he quickly became our main threat ahead of Nani, Kagawa etc and teams recognised this, doubled up on him and reduced his influence. That said more about the rest of the team than Januzaj, and Martial now. I wouldn't say either just became bad or lost form, they were/are just well dealt with but still produce the best moments.

1968~~~
I remember he played good minutes during the tour this summer, and even Van Gaal praised him as a potential forward. Then he started the season scoring a goal and showing lights and shadows, but nothing especially bad to send him out on loan. Maybe something happened in trainings, because even if LVG was not happy with his performances he could have been a useful member of our short squad.

It's all a bit weird in my opinion, especially when we try to play slow possession football and we need to open a parked bus every week. In that situation we need creativity and sparks of talent who can make a difference, and Januzaj has more 'magic' than Lingard, Mata, Fellaini and Memphis all together. I don't say Adnan is globally better, but in terms of pure talent and creativity I think Januzaj and even Pereira are above them, and they are precisely the ones who got less chances to play this possession game.

If he didn't trust the kids because he wanted more mature players, or a more physical profile then it's OK. But at least f*cking adjust the system and the team instructions to their strengths, and not to expose their weaknesses like he did the whole season. It doesn't mean the players should be safe from criticism, but under this ridiculous management I refuse to write off anyone of them, especially the younger ones.

1969~~~
Have we forgotten so soon how this kid was the only bright spark in the Moyes era. The boy singlehandedly carried the team on his back, we were loving it back then. All of a sudden he is useless? This place at times.

1970~~~
I remember the thread full of posters laughing off a huge offer from PSG saying that in no way should we sell him. 

People are very short sighted at times, quick to label a prospect as the future and even quicker to relegate their prospects following a patch of bad form

1971~~~
So, his form from 2 years ago means he deserves a shot? To me, that's just laughable. Perhaps we should bring Van Persie back, his form 3 years back was incredible. 

He's obviously not showing it in training, just like he obviously didn't show it in training for Dortmund. If he was, he'd get a chance. People love to think that Louis has an agenda against him for some reason. Despite the fact he has shown repeatedly that he has no problem playing young players. He even gave Adnan his chance at the start of the season, and Adnan didn't take it.

When he starts doing it in training, my guess is he'll get a chance. To say he deserves a chance is just wrong.

1972~~~
You mean in the same way people called Van Persie useless last year? 2 years after he had been top class?

1973~~~
In my opinion people completely overblew his performances that season. Yes, he was very good. But people were talking about him as being better than Ronaldo etc. Way OTT. Now, you're right, people are calling him useless, which is again OTT.

However, to say he deserves to play, as some people here think, is wrong in my opinion. I think he might be better than what's playing if given a chance, as he surely has lots of ability. The question is whether or not he has the mental fortitude, and the rumblings coming out from various managers who are around him would suggest he's a bit iffy in that sense. 

As I've said above, he needs to do it in training, then get his chances. Or, if he's put on today, take that chance, do something to force Louis to play him. He shouldn't be given a shot based on what he did 2 years ago, if he's not producing in training.

1974~~~
Really hope we get to see him today for at least 20 minutes. Getting a bit joke how little opportunity he's been given.

1975~~~
I hope Januzaj is watching Rashford. Talent means nothing without results.

1976~~~
If I am Januzaj I'll watch how Memphis has been given chance after chance by LVG while I am not even coming on as a sub despite always showing promise.

1977~~~
We don't know what his attitude is like do we though.  Rumours are he's being dumped for attitude and not talent.

1978~~~
H
He really hasn't always shown promise though. He was poor last year, had a decent first game of this season and was poor after that. He was also poor in Dortmund.

1979~~~
Don't think he was that poor in Dortmund. Did you see some of his matches? I saw highlights and he had some great assists. Even if he was crap throughout the matches, those assists alone wouldn't deem him as "poor" I think. Besides, it's not like we have attackers scoring goals and assists left and right. A young player needs to be given a run as they will be a bit inconsistent. 

Rumors are just rumors as far as I'm concerned. On the pitch his attitude seems fine.

1980~~~
Dortmund came out and explicitly said he had an attitude problem. How is that a rumor.

1981~~~
Always showing promise, what? Last season he was very poor, often the worst player on the pitch for us

Read the matchday threads where he played. Seriously, read them if you need a reminder.

I dont like stats but his pass percentahe and goal contribution were atrocious last season. He also lost the ball many many times. Its all on whoscored.com.

1982~~~
There's been plenty of chatter about Depay's attitude as well if that's the comparison.

1983~~~
Martial and Rashford already have done far more at MUFC than Januzaj ever did. Rashford has scored 2 against Arsenal and 1 now against City. Rashford was incredible today and if we do get 4th it will be largely due to him.

Where are those international teams ilthat want Januzaj now? If it really was more than glimpses he wouldnt have been dropped from Dortmund and there would be teams in for him now.

Where are these mysterious teams that rate and want Januzaj? Where? Thats right they dont exist.

1984~~~
Hence hes been dropped several times already this season.

1985~~~
What you want the teams to do ? Publicly announce one by one ?

I am sure there will be plenty of clubs really delighted to take a talent like Januzaj if we were foolish enough to sell him.

1986~~~
no its the opposite. Memphis was benched for his poor show some time back and was given only sub runs. But in those sub runs, he did excecptionally well in some of the games and was then reinstated. Plus Memphis isnt getting anymore chances either.

1987~~~
Yes which is why Dortmund sent a free Januzaj home early and there are literally zero transfer market rumors for Januzaj despite him being in his 3rd season for us. This means if we get rid it will be for some small fee to some mid-tier club.

1988~~~
i think he wanted to come back early. They didnt send him back

1989~~~
I personally think it's disappointing when he can't get minutes coming on for the likes of Lingard who don't offer an awful lot.

1990~~~
Pretty sure a loan is a bilateral contract and that he cant come back unless Dortmund agree to release him. Otherwise what team would take a loan if players can come and go as they please. They benched him, and decided they didnt want to hold him to his loan contract.

1991~~~
Really? I think Lingard is a vital part of our team nowadays.

1992~~~
I dont get the Lingard hate here either. Lad put in a great shift today.

1993~~~
God help us if he is.

1994~~~
Feel sorry for him but I'm sure his (reported) attitude must have contributed to his present state.  Doesn't look like Adnan will be around if LVG is (for some sick reason) still around next year.

1995~~~
Martial- Yes, maybe. 
Rashford- NO. Its still 6 games! Its like saying we won the title that year because of Macheda!

No team will publicly say we love him and want to sign him, because all that would do is a) Get his Market Value up, b) earn Januzaj a new contract to ward off interest making signing him tougher

1996~~~
I don't understand how this guy never plays yet this thread is always top 5 in the Player Performance Section. 
Maybe....




He's just not that good?

1997~~~
Fell out with Van Gaal who doesn't rate him slash thinks he has a poor attitude and is a bit to into himself. No crime talking about it, he's talented and a young player who the fans want to see.

1998~~~
Behave.

1999~~~
Agree to an extent but if the rumours are true, and I'm just saying if, then it makes sense he's not playing as the attitude in training needs to be right to be considered for a match

Never said I agree with the rumours by the way, just saying 'if', if you know what I mean

2000~~~
The problem is he is very good and we've been hurt by promising talent leaving us in the past. It is shocking that he doesn't even get time as a substitute.

2001~~~
Excellent rebuttal.

2002~~~
5 goals in 9 games, is surely a great return, I could be wrong but didn't Januzaj do the same when he came into first team. Short memory and flavour of the month I guess.

2003~~~
Dear lord. Goals aren't what makes a complete performance. You're completely biased and I suggest you watch those games again. Rashford has done great since playing for the first team, but his performances weren't as complete or as dominant as Adnan's great games. One thing that I will give him credit for is his goals against the top sides. That's impressive. I think Rashford's looked a lot more comfortable at the first team level the past 2 games despite only scoring 1 goal compared to the 4 other goals in 2 game performances when he first came up. That's a good sign.

Oh and I don't think Adnan should have played today either. Thought work rate was important so I was completely in favor of keeping Lingard on.

2004~~~
I find comments like this laughable. In Adnan's first season, which we'd all agree was his only good season, he played 1740 minutes, scored 4 goals and had 3 assists.
This season, Jesse has played 1738 minutes. He scored 4 goals, and had 3 assists.
Jesse is also much better defensively, more disciplined, and in my opinion makes far better decisions. Obviously the latter is just my opinion.

Why do people believe there's such a huge difference between what the two of them produce? 

Stats from whoscored.com

2005~~~
Because stats aren't all there is to a performance. There were multiple times where he didn't score or assist, but still was the team's best player.

2006~~~
That makes no sense at all. You've just confirmed Lingard hasn't done anything more than Januzaj (who was much younger at the time). Im questioning why one of them starts every match and the other doesn't get a look in. Hardly difficult to understand that opinion even if you disagree with it.

2007~~~
It makes perfect sense. Your comment was that Lingard doesn't do much. I've pointed out that he does the exact same from an attacking point of view as Januzaj, whilst being a much more disciplined team player. 
One isn't currently getting a look in because it has been 2 years since he showed good form. 1 is in because he's showing semi competent attacking play, whilst helping the team from a defensive aspect, and keeping the shape better up front. 
I'm not saying Jesse is a better player, but to say he "doesn't do much" is just completely incorrect.

2008~~~
I agree, stats aren't all there is to a performance. However, the comment I was replying to stated that Lingard doesn't do much. That's wrong in my opinion. Statistically, he does just as much as Adnan did when Adnan showed the best form of his career. This, by the way, was 2 years ago. Until he starts showing he's capable of doing what Jesse is currently doing, he doesn't deserve to come back into the team. Obviously in training, he's not doing that.

2009~~~
Rashford scored as much in 2 months as Januzaj in total for Man United.

2010~~~
He should get a chance on the right. Mata is not exactly pulling up trees, so let's see what Adnan can do.

2011~~~
Its all it deserves.

2012~~~
Mata played well today, but I'm desperate to see what a front four of Rashford (ST), Martial (LW), Lingard (CAM) and Januzaj (RW) can produce.

2013~~~
Hmm, that would be interesting, or even Januzaj in the middle and Lingard on the right for tracking back.

2014~~~
Dear lord, Rashford won the Arsenal and Manchester City games for us. If that isn't a "complete performance," I really don't know what is. He's played far fewer minutes and games for us than Januzaj, and he has literally taken the bull by the horns and scored crucial winners for us.

Januzaj NEVER did that even in 2013-14, his supposed "break-out" season. Call me biased, why don't you show me concrete evidence where he won big games for us, EVER. I suggest you read the matchday threads from 2014-2015 if you think he was anything but piss poor last season.

2015~~~
Macheda scored ONE winner for us and then that was it. Rashford kept us in the Europa league longer than we deserved to be in it, and the sole reason we are within touching distance of Top 4 is because of Rashford winning us VERY tough games against Arsenal and City (away). If we somehow miraculously get top 4 this season, it will be because of Rashford.

Januzaj contributed ZERO to our top 4 finish last year, and despite his best efforts under Moyes, we still ended up in 7th. Goals and assists win games, and Januzaj is weak in that department. He's an attacking player afterall. And let's not forget that he was an absolute massive defensive liability in 2014-2015. Almost every possession he had last year resulted in an errant pass or simple dispossession by tackle when he tried to dribble past 3 defenders.

2016~~~
Pogba is the only one I can realistically think of in recent years. All the other youngsters we got rid of were the right decision. Anyone remember Chris Eagles? He sure looked good in the 2007 pre-season.

2017~~~
You aren't well aware of this player that. Goal and assists is a big part of his game. Now whether or not he is a Man United level player is what is in questions here I think he definitely can be, others think he can't but the only way to find out is to play him more and see if he is up to it.

But he is a goal scorer and play maker.

2018~~~
3,175 minutes played in the EPL, CL and Europa. 5 goals and 5 assists.

Great goal scorer and play maker that. Not trying to be snide, but he has gotten over 3,000 minutes of senior game time for MUFC (not including his FA cup or other appearances). That's a LOT of fecking chances. To produce only 5 goals and 5 assists out of all those minutes, that's crazy piss poor for a club with standards and ambitions like MUFC.

Let's compare Januzaj to his primary competitors for a spot on the team:

Lingard: 1,737 minutes EPL, CL and Europa: 6 goals and 4 assists
Rashford: 560 minutes EPL and Europa: 5 goals and 1 assist
Martial: 3,203 minutes EPL, CL and Europa: 13 goals and 8 assists
Memphis: 2,012 minutes EPL, CL and Europa: 7 goals and 6 assists

I'm not even getting started when you start talking about being a defensive liability or breaking up our attacks.

Last season Januzaj had something like an 80% pass completion (compared to say 90% for Mata, a similar attacking player).

Januzaj also <b>completed only 27.8% of his dribbles</b>, an astonishingly low percentage (compared to say 43% for Mata). That means that a shocking <b>72.2% of the time that Januzaj attempted to dribble the ball, he lost the ball. </b>How is this even remotely considered acceptable standards for a senior MUFC side? <b><span style="text-decoration: underline">This is shockingly bad</span></b>, and for me, this is why I believe he has been dropped by both MUFC and Dortmund. You simply can't have a player running around at the highest level losing the ball this much.

Januzaj also averaged something like 33 passes per game, compared to Mata with say 50 passes per game.

Januzaj also averaged something like 1.4 chances created per game, compared to say 1.9 for Mata.

Summary: on paper, Januzaj is by far the worst attacking player out of the contenders. If the lad can't dribble, well he'd better be passing or shooting the ball. Unfortunately he doesn't even pass that much compared to his peers, and when he does he has a bad completion percentage, and obviously he can't shoot to score to save his life.

Now I'm not saying he's not talented, he clearly is. But he has been playing very poorly for quite some time. MUFC has given the lad plenty of chances (<b>3000+ minutes, more than any of his peers</b>). Januzaj simply did not take his chances, and more worryingly, he constantly disrupted our attacks, broke up our plays, and kept gifting the other side the ball. He can't score? Fine. But at a minimum, do not be a massive defensive liability.

You can blame LVG, you can blame his age, whatever. The fact is he looks SCARED when he's playing. Compare to Rashford and Martial - absolutely fearless in the face of any opposition.

p.s. Januzaj has zero goals and zero assists for his national team. Go figure.

2019~~~
He also scored a winner in the next game away to Sunderland. He was a catalyst for our title charge

2020~~~
You're right - feck how do you even remember something like that. I forgot we even had that hideous blue kit back then.

2021~~~
Ji Maria doesnt rate Januzaj it would appear, gang.

2022~~~
Seems that big rectangular thing at the end of the grassy field with all the netting and made of wood with a tall hairy man wearing funny gloves standing in front of it doesn't rate Januzaj either.

Just saying.

2023~~~
I remember watching that game and thinking we're really on to something with him. The goal was a deflected shot but it was deserved. Late in the game too IIRC

2024~~~
Great finish against Everton in 06/07. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2025~~~
Now a League 1 player and is 30. Feck we're old.

2026~~~
Give us his goals, assists and minutes in his first season and then let's compare how they stack up. 

Comparing his stats under Van Gaal, who has managed him terribly and made a mess of his development is not an apt comparison. Minutes just add up when you are used sparingly and have limited opportunities to make those goals and assists.

2027~~~
2,055 minutes (EPL and CL only), 4 goals and 4 assists. Still the worst out of the lot in terms of goals scored and assists. I've already posted above on his atrocious successful dribbles and chances created per game.

If you want to draw conclusions, I really would like to know based on what? Because all you seem to be saying is, "he's been dropped by both LVG and Dortmund (who have both claimed he has an attitude problem) and playing like sh*t so therefore LVG has mismanaged him!" Frankly it is a very weird conclusion to draw based on the facts. We have absolutely no evidence anywhere that LVG has mismanaged him or that Januzaj has been treated poorly. Heck, Januzaj wanted to leave Dortmund to go back to MUFC early.

Stats, being dropped, etc., don't tell the whole story I get that. And goals/assists don't tell the whole picture. Even the fact that the only two professional managers who have ever managed him in his senior career in two different leagues have dropped him isn't by itself damming. Or the fact that his goal scoring and assists are below that of his same-age peer group at MUFC. We have established that his ball retention and loss of ball is frankly criminal (23% successful dribble for a professional footballer on 50K a week?), but hey, stuff happens right? What I'm trying to say is, based on what I just wrote, how is it even remotely within the realm of reason that your initial conclusion is "oh he's just being poorly managed and getting bad treatment and none of this is his fault at all." It's just so baffling. It's so much more reasonable to conclude, based on the above, that the truth is more likely that Januzaj is having some kind of mental or confidence issue and is therefore playing like crap and therefore LVG and Dortmund have dropped him, resulting in this vicious cycle where he loses even more confidence.

You also need to acknowledge the very real possibility, that he was just a flash in the pan. Was he one of our best players in 2013-14? Of course. But then being a 5'7" horse jockey doesn't exactly make you tall does it?

THEN, maybe we can have an honest discussion of whether LVG should help Januzaj get his confidence back by playing him consistently as a starter. I think Januzaj should get that shot to be honest, but it would be equally reasonable to say, "hey, he's had his chance, we need to get 4th, so we can't afford to take this risk right now so maybe next season." I would tend to let both Januzaj and Pereira play until the rest of the season, but at the same time I realize blaming LVG for Januzaj playing like absolute wank last season is completely irrational.

2028~~~
Are you done editing?

2029~~~
Writing on my iphone so lots of typos and bad copying and pasting. Now do you actually have something to say or is this your attempt at being non-responsive?

2030~~~
Nothing to say at all? OK.

Let me ask you this: how would you feel about MUFC playing a forward/winger who will lose the ball over 2/3 of the time he gets it and will score no goals and get no assists to show for it? If it was anybody but Januzaj, everyone would be screaming for that player to be benched. Just because it's Januzaj, suddenly it becomes LVG's fault that he's not playing well/at all. Baffling.

2031~~~
2 winners. Rashford was good in that game  and also arsenal and City games, Agreed. BUt wasn't the pressure on Macheda higher! He has equal chances of turning out to be a macheda as of turning into a great striker. 
Januzaj was hardly used last year. He has clocked minutes, but they were accumulated by playing last 10 minutes of a game. If we finish 6th this season, or 7th or even 8th, would you say Martial had a poor season because despite his best efforts we didnt finish in top 4. You sound like a person who just cares about stats. YEsterday, Martial was IMO among top 3 players. Yet he didn't get any goals or assists. Mata IMO was the best player vs Stoke. He had a hand in all 3 goals. Was the provider of the pass that result in assist (pre-assist), yet he had 0 goals, 0assists that game.
A player who was arguably the team's top 3 outfield players the season before finding his place under threat from ADM, will obviously be more selfish to prove himself to the boss. Thats human nature after all.

2032~~~
IMO scoring the winner against City away against an extremely hostile crowd is about as high pressure as it can get. Not to mention the brace against Arsenal.

<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">This is one of the big myths of redcafe. Januzaj played 1,025 senior minutes last year in 21 appearances (average 49 minutes per appearance)</span></b>. You can't accumulate 1,025 minutes worth of "10 minute sub appearances." Sorry, just not true. Defending Januzaj is fine, but last year he played plenty and has nothing to show for it. Let me repeat, 1,025 senior minutes in 21 senior appearances, zero goals, zero assists, 23% dribble completion and 1.4 chances created per game.


First off, no, I wouldn't say Martial had a poor season. I don't care where we finish in relation to an individual player's performance. I never claimed that and I never will. If you notice, I never came out and said "Januzaj is crap and was always crap." I'm saying, he's playing poorly, and objectively speaking, he's not producing goals or assists. Stats aren't everything as I took great pains to point out many many times. The only one I actually care about is that he's only completing 23% or so of his dribbles. If you read the matchday threads from last season, the comments are FILLED with posts about how often Januzaj is making a stupid decision and losing possession in dangerous areas. That's dangerous for us.

This comparison is logically flawed, because both Martial and Mata actually have scored far more many goals and provided far more many assists than Januzaj has. You can cherry-pick single games where neither got on the scoresheet, <b><span style="text-decoration: underline">but on the whole, on average, players who consistently create great attacking performances score goals and assists</span></b>. I can't think of a single highly regarded attacking player who isn't racking up goals/assists at will. Ozil is on 18 EPL assists this season. I mean, <span style="text-decoration: underline">even Tom Cleverley has a better goal/assist haul (per minutes played) than Januzaj.</span>

Players who were arguably completely unknowns (Rashford) will obviously be more selfish to take his one and only chance, and guess what, Rashford took that chance. Why couldn't Januzaj?

2033~~~
Great post

2034~~~
Those stats are similar to his peers who have played this season under VG (Barring Martial, who is an absolute superstar). Rashford is not an apt comparison either since he is playing as an out and out striker.

Why did we go from comparing him to his peers to Mata suddenly? Is the plan to compare him with the best stats in each category to project him as a terrible player?

I am not posting "casual observation", I make observations based on watching every Manchester United game and supporting this club. I put much credence into that than stat comparison, which can be casually shifted from his peers to Mata to make a point.

Why I say Van Gaal has mismanaged him, is because Depay, who has only looked good in three games against terrible opposition, was afforded chance after chance, while Januzaj wasn't given the same luxury. The focus last season was on Galacticos signings and stupid formations, and this season he was sent out on loan after performing reasonably well in the first 4 games of the season. As for the loan, they are a crap shoot most of the time. BVB got him as a squad pad up and did not use him much. Tuchel also did not make any scathing observations on Januzaj. He said, that the players mind wasn't focused, which can happen when a young player is not getting opportunities and loses direction.

I am not saying that Januzaj doesn't share any blame in this. He wasn't wise in choosing BVB as his loan destination; should have gone to a lower PL or a championship club. If the reports of attitude issues are true, then he needs to put his head down and work harder.

Using stats against him as per your convenience is doing a disservice to the player. You can use them however you want. I can go on and say that Rashford has not scored in 5 of the 8 games he has started for us, which would be equally stupid.

2035~~~
Hysterical much?

Calm down, there are no prizes for winning arguments.

2036~~~
Cool, not only can you accurately read LVG's mind, you can also sense my state of mind over the internet. MI6 should hire you immediately.

2037~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Fair play for the long and detailed factual posts. They certainly do add to the debate.

At the same time, I think it's important to understand why people think so highly of the player Januzaj can potentially be. I don't think there's a soul here, an admirer of his abilities or otherwise, who will tell you that Adnan Januzaj has good end product. He doesn't. Everyone knows that. But what he does have is the sort of natural talent that very few do, and of course the experience of having starred in the first team displaying that. He has had a couple of indifferent years now, but fans will always want an elite talent to be given chances. Especially when you have someone like Lingard starting every game in our team. To compare the two, and solely focus on end product, would be to be missing the kind of player Januzaj is. Lingard certainly is further in his development and has a knack of popping up with a goal or assist every now and then. Januzaj, however, is far more likely to hurt his opposing defender through his skill and technical quality, during most of the game.

I'm not sure how reasonable that would be given he hasn't had his chance this season at all. He was daft in deciding on Dortmund but when he did play in the 1st 4 games he didn't do any worse than Lingard has been. He scored a winner and showed glimses of quality along whilst drifting out of games. He certainly didn't do as bad some of the laughable displays Memphis has had for us this season. And that's the crux of the matter. It frustrates people that Januzaj isn't afforded the same leeway as we allow many other players given he's one of our most talented.

If it's an attitude issue, then of course he hasn't a leg to stand on, and must sort that out if he wants to play for United.

2038~~~
I hate pulling statistics and I didn't want to do it for all of Lingard, Martial and Rashford. I happen to recall Mata from somewhere so I just used his numbers for chances created and pass completion.

I don't actually disagree with anything you just wrote, other than the Depay comparison, since Depay has been dropped and has only average 55 minutes per appearance this season (compare to 49 minutes for Januzaj last season).

These are all his appearances for us last season. You can add all the minutes you want but they do tell a story of how he was used.

2040~~~
1. Agreed. No one is even arguing that it is a great achievement on Rashford's part
2. Disagree. It was 9 starts only. Which basically skews the stats. 49mins/appearance is also indicative that the player plays generally as a substitute. Just checked whoscored. its 1.2 successful dribbles in 2.9 attempts. That is 41.3%. Martial has 2.8 successful in 6.3 attempts That is 44%. (Stats per game in EPL only). 
This is where stats become to bite you back- <b>Adnan had 2.8 unsuccessful touches and been dispossessed 1.9 times. Martial- 2.3 unsuccessful touches and been dispossessed 3.2 times (Stats /90mins)</b>
3. Stats like proved above tell part of the story. We are talking of key passes now right. Januzaj had 1.7 key passes/game, Martial 1.3(both /90minutes), Lingard 0.8, Mata 1.6. And hence proved why Stats are possibly the worst thing you can use to compare players.
Now, not saying Januzaj has been better last season than Martial this season, but I can actually prove this is the case using the method you are using to prove otherwise
4. No, if a layer has established himself, and then is losing his place will be more desperate than an 18 year old who is yet to burst.

2041~~~
Are you aggregating the stats to include his 2013-2014? I'm looking solely at Januzaj's 2014-2015 season (i.e., the reason why he has been dropped this season). His performances were obviously much better in 2013-2014. If you look at the 2014-15 numbers only, it tells a far different story. Imagine aggregating RVP's different seasons' worth of stats and concluding he's still a great player. Just doesn't make sense.

whoscored.com is not working on my computer but here is the source for the dribble figure for 2014-15 season.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchester-united/360/blog/post/2601065/adnan-januzaj-loan-from-manchester-united-to-Dortmund" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchest...nuzaj-loan-from-manchester-united-to-Dortmund</a>

"Januzaj also lost the ball when dribbling far more often than Di Maria or Mata, completing 27.8 percent of his dribbles whilst Di Maria's success rate was 29.1 percent and Mata's was 43.1 percent."

And substitute or not, 49 minutes per game and 9 starts is plenty of time to take your chance. You only need 1 minute to score a goal.

Something happened to Januzaj last season, something not very good. Either his success under Moyes got to his head, or Januzaj just doesn't have it, or both LVG and Dortmund are out of their minds and are sabotaging Januzaj. I can't conclusively state which one it is, but I can say that Januzaj started playing poorly last season, and still has not recovered.

2042~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://www.whoscored.com/Players/130334/History/Adnan-Januzaj" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.whoscored.com/Players/130334/History/Adnan-Januzaj</a>

Only 2014/15 season
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/SKC9PfF.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/SKC9PfF.jpg"/>

This is only for EPL appearances. So, the MKDons loss game and the other appearances(possibly in FA Cup) aren't there. But dont think it would make that much of a difference.

2043~~~
A 14% difference in the number reported by ESPN and what can be derived from whoscored.com. Interesting. It seems Mata's "derived" number from whoscored.com is 64%, which is also about 14% higher than the ESPN number. So I think we can safely conclude, that for one reason or another, whoscored.com has a 14% higher number than ESPN.

The point then still stands: Januzaj has a much worse dribble success rate than Mata, and according to whoscored.com, Januzaj has a considerably worse dribble success rate than Memphis and Lingard.

2044~~~
I think he may be a better dribbler statistically than most others
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/Nzfuj5n.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/Nzfuj5n.jpg"/>

2045~~~
And yes, statsistically I can even prove that Mata has been dispossessed lesser times than Martial. Rather Mata's stats for being dispossessed may be among the best for our attacking players this season.

Another reason not to be reliant on stats

2046~~~
Can you find a single stat from 2014-15, where Januzaj was actually better in any of the key metrics than any of his main rivals (Mata, Lingard, Memphis, Rashford, Martial) on whoscored.com? I'm talking about things like creating assists, scoring goals, beating a man, successful tackles, killer passes.

I mean, it's extremely convenient to say not to rely on stats when they are overwhelmingly against you.

2047~~~
Key passes/90 minutes

Januzaj- 1.7/90 minutes Last season
Martial- 1.3/90 min
Lingard- 0.8/90 min
Mata- 1.6/90 min
Memphis- 0.7/90 min

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/bVUjHey.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/bVUjHey.jpg"/>


So, now can we say stats are a poor indicator, as clearly Januzaj in his worse season did better than our players this season

2048~~~
What is the difference between a per 90 mins stat and per game stat on whoscored.com?
I see that the key passes you mentioned shows 1.7 per 90 mins but only 0.9 per game. Though both show up 850 mins in 2014/15.

2049~~~
Per game stat divides the total by no. of appearances, /90min stat divides the total by minutes played and multiplies by 90.
Basically, 1st one is a bit biased against guys who come as subs, but favourable in cases where player is taken off early in case of poor performance

2050~~~
Well, in the interest of thoroughness, see below.

Draw from this whatever conclusions you want. Numbers are per 90 minutes (except goals/assists obviously). 

<b>Goals (Januzaj worst)</b>
Martial - 10
Mata - 6
Memphis - 5
Lingard - 4
Januzaj - 0

<b>Assists (Januzaj tied for worst with Memphis)</b>
Mata - 7
Martial - 3
Lingard - 3
Januzaj - 0
Memphis - 0
<b>
Successful Dribbles (Januzaj worst)</b>
Mata - 61%
Memphis - 59%
Lingard - 55%
Martial - 45%
Januzaj - 39%
<b>
Pass Completion (Januzaj 3rd)</b>
Lingard - 85%
Mata - 84%
Januzaj - 82%
Martial - 78%
Memphis - 77%

<b>Key Passes (Januzaj 1st)</b>
Januzaj- 1.7
Mata- 1.6
Martial- 1.3
Lingard- 0.8
Memphis- 0.7

2051~~~
This is after we compare the worst Januzaj season with possibly the best of Martial and Lingard. Mata is experienced and Memphis who is also having his worst season hasn't done any better!

2052~~~
I'm just using this comparison as a basis for why Januzaj was dropped in favor of the other players. That is all. And by the most important metric of all (goals/assists), Memphis actually has done far better. He's also much better at beating his man in a dribble than Januzaj.

I'm sure the comparison of the 2013-14 Januzaj will be much more favorable to him, but that is not the Januzaj that we have today.

2053~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> This page

2054~~~
I was just pointing stats to prove that stats are a useless indicator. Mata who has been blamed for losing ball too easily has been dispossessed less than Martial.
And in the first 4 games before going out on loan, he was our joint leading scorer. So, if goals and assists are that important, He should have been retained

2055~~~
I love how many pages this thread has increased despite him hasn't played any minute since.

2056~~~
The game is passing Januzaj at a blistering pace with lots of new talent coming throguh. Guess some people just dont want to see Januzaj get lost in this process.

2057~~~
My point is people should just keep the thread quiet until there's something new.It's the same with Powell's thread people keep talking about how shit his attitude was despite he's out injured for 10 months and some of them didn't even notice that.

2058~~~
Memphis was benched after a string of poor performances and then he got only sub appearances. But in many of those games, he made a Lingard/Rashford may not be as talented as januzaj but they work hard and have been contributing positively for the most time. The reward for their hardwork shouldn't be to be benched for someone who just returned from being benched in another team.

2059~~~
He just isnt that good and very unreliable, that's why LvG prefers Martial, Lingard, Mata. Martial and Mata who have some genuine quality, mata for his end product and Martial for the goals and breaking defences, creating out of nothing. Lingard is a hard, stable worker who still has had some output this season, these are players a coach can build on. Not these Memphis and Januzaj who might be extremely talented, but just very unreliable.

2060~~~
Just sell him off.  It's obvious LVG doesn't rate him and I can't see him breaking through with the likes of Martial, Jesse and Rashford breaking through and solidifying their places.

2061~~~
Jesus. Then again that confirms why we are an average team I suppose.

2062~~~
Holy statfest Batman! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

If he is transfered in the summer I wonder if he'll stay in the PL or try Spain/Italy.

2063~~~
Januzaj has never been a goalscorer so using it as a way of downplaying his ability is pretty pointless. He rarely scored for the under 18s despite usually showing that he was the best player on the pitch and having more influence on games and only scored once in 20 games for the under 21s before being named player of the year and promoted to the first team. What he did show was brilliant ability to make space for himself and others with his dribbling and passing ability and a lot of maturity in his game for such a young player, he often made the assist for the goal or the pass before the assist to open up the game. It was only once he got into the first team that he seemed to become more focused on trying to beat 3 or 4 players and focusing more on scoring goals himself. Ability and potential wise he has more than enough to make it at the top level but its up to himself to add the other things like work rate and consistency. I'd love to see him go back to playing the playmaker style of football which he used to play because I think it could be very effective in the team we have at the moment with the pace and movement of Rashford, Martial and Lingard

2064~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This

2065~~~
The big thing for me with Januzaj is that the people who claim he deserves a place in the team, or that it's a travesty that he's not getting minutes, are basing this all on form he showed 2 years ago. Not anything from recent times. As I've said many times, he needs to be showing it in training, which he clearly isn't, as he's not being afforded a place in the team. When he does show it there, he will get his chance - just as he did at the start of the year, which he then didn't take. Scored a lovely goal but was largely average in my opinion (then again, who wasn't?) during that run.

2066~~~
It's not just that, it's also:

A) Everything I've seen from him this season  as well - whether it was 4 games for us, or most of the games he got at Dortmund, you could see his quality on the ball. Of course he lacked end product, and faded out of games and needs to work on how he imposes himself on games. But the class is still obvious. It's not as if he looks a nothing player like we've seen SO many times from Memphis this season. So people want that genuine quality he has on the ball given real faith and trust, at least more than it has so far. As I've often said, he's one of our most gifted, and in our interest, we need him to progress.

B) Our attack has been rubbish this season. As alluded to in point A) Memphis has been atrocious at times, and Lingard can often just give you work-rate. He pops up with a goal sometimes, but he has games where he simply doesn't have the natural talent to impact and puts in minutes of pointlessness.

So add those two together, the natural talent of Januzaj and the state our attack has been in this season, and it's no surprise why people would want him to play more. I don't think many people are saying "Start him every game!". Of course not. And even if not this season now (as we're in the final stretch), but I'd prioritize him much higher than we have this season. Given how shit our attack is, did we really need to loan him out anyway? I don't think so. We could have used him this season. When Memhpis was so awful, Januzaj could have been given chances.

2067~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The amount of effort...take a bow

2068~~~
I am really not sure where this lads career is going. Obviously still have high hopes for him but his lack of pace seems to cause him difficulties in the PL. Could really do with a run of games as there is every opportunity for him to make the right hand side his own.

2069~~~
He has the talent but, at almost any level, that's not enough. He needs to forget that first season under Moyes. Maybe he thought he had made it and acted that way in training, maybe not. The reality doesn't matter because end of the day only thing he can do is get his head down and take his chance when he gets it. 

If given a proper chance and with the right attitude on his part, with the other talents we have like Martial, Rashford and even Memphis, he could really have a huge impact. Just don't hope we don't give up on him and move him on this summer without him getting a proper run in the side.

2070~~~
Spot on. It's the things that the statistics don't show that Adnan excels at currently. If you just watch him it is obvious how good he is anyway, forget the stats.
In the future, if we nurture his talent, then I think the stats will match his talents. At least in the assists area. His passing ability is comfortably better than some of our first team attackers and those that beat him in that department don't have his guile and dribbling ability anyway.

2071~~~
The bold part alone is why he should at least be given a solid run in the starting line up (and not be philosophized). That "sort of natural talent" is rare by it's on but to actually show it in premier league matches at such a young age is extremely rare. 

I am sorry but everyone can throw stats at me all they want but no matter what they suggest, I am can't accept someone like Lingard is a better player than Adnan.

2072~~~
Spot on. It's obvious who didn't watch him at youth level when they post. They don't understand his quality because they think he needs to be a goal scorer or that dribbling is his only method of influencing the game when that was just something he developed later. Let him play at 10 so he doesn't feel the need to dribble and to give him more of a need to be on the ball. I feel like at this point that's the only way to bring back his pre-Moyes style of play because when he's on the wing he often hugs the touchline and just tries to dribble past player. When he first came to United he still was able to play his style on the wing, but it's disappearing.

BTW, I'm not sure if he will outplay Lingard, Mata, etc... right now. However, I think he deserves some playing time in order to develop him.

2073~~~
I think this is my biggest bugbear with this thread. When people say he deserves it. We can only say he deserves it if we see what he's doing in training. Obviously, none of us on here can (unless secretly there are some coaches frequenting the caf). If he shows it in training, then yes, he deserves a shot. But to say he does is based on no evidence in my opinion.

2074~~~
I also find it quite bemusing. If he's not playing he most likely deserves it. For all of LvG's faults, I find him to be a fair manager who gives all players in his squad a chance so if Januzaj isn't getting games he's most likely doing something very wrong.

Even if he was in the team I see us being no better tbh. At this point in time I feel we'll be worse off as a team with him in the starting lineup.

2075~~~
Alright maybe that wasn't the right word. I think he should be given playing time to develop him. I think he should be getting similar treatment and chances as other players. Maybe it is all about defensive work rate, but if that was the case he should be getting chances in the 10 spot and Mata offers the same amount of defensive protection as Adnan on the wings. We should have never called back Adnan from Dortmund if we weren't going to play him. He was already playing so little over there due to how good the attacking players were and because of his lack of fitness being a detriment to the pressing Dortmund wants out of him, but he was still playing here and there.

<a class="username" data-user="71351, @El Jefe" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/71351/">@El Jefe</a>
I disagree. I feel as though some players have shorter leashes and a lot of the young players are only played out of necessity. BTW, I'm not claiming he would make the team much better or some nonsense like that. Not sure if he would outplay Lingard right now, but I think he needs playing time.

2076~~~
Probably the closest thing we have to a right winger atm.

2077~~~
I hate to beat a dead horse, but serious question. Can you think of any playmaker on any other team (whose focus isn't on scoring goals) who has failed to rack up assists? I'm really struggling to think of anyone to be honest. For instance, if you look at Ozil (not really known as a goalscorer) he has something like 18 assists this season. If Ozil is too high a bar, then look at maybe Coutinho, with 7 goals and 5 assists this season. Or Ross Barkley (Everton) who is the same age as Januzaj, with 8 goals and 7 assists (in just the EPL). Or Payet (West Ham) who's on 11 goals and 8 assists. Or Giaccherini (when he was at Sunderland) was on 4 goals and 4 assists, and that's SUNDERLAND.

Surely, for a club with ambitions like MUFC, we should have playmakers who are better than Payet or Ross Fing Barkley, and those two can beat a man and have tidy dribbling.

Somehow Januzaj has become the only playmaker in the EPL who can get away with not scoring any goals or creating assists on the back of a "very obvious you are an idiot if you can't see his talent" argument. Playmakers on every other team are expected to (and actually do) make passes that directly lead to goals, or actually score goals themselves. What makes Januzaj so special that he is excused from this crucial function that all playmakers in any league are capable of?

And just so you know, Januzaj actually is pretty piss poor at beating a man in a 1v1. He has poor pace and the lowest dribble success rate out of all of MUFC's starting outfield players. Let's not make stuff up. According to ESPN statistics he has 27% success dribble rate and according to whoscored.com he has 38%. Choose your poison.

Last time I checked, our biggest problem is lack of chances created and lack of shots.on goal. The last thing we need are more outfield players who do neither.

2078~~~
Pretty ignorant post. You're comparing a kid on the fringes of the first team at a big club to A) One of the world's best number 10's and others such as Payet who are in their prime and B) a set of playmakers/attackers who find starting much easier given they're playing for smaller clubs.

Nothing. But with him being 21, the idea is to develop so he can rack up goals and assists greater than the players you mention in a few years time. That's what faith in youth is all about. He had a year to forget last year, but that doesn't mean you never start him ever again. To put up goals and assists he does need to play football after all. And noones saying he should play every game, but it's about giving him chances. Same with Periera. They aren't going to become the players we want them to by never playing.

2079~~~
<a class="username" data-user="92739, @Ji_Maria" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/92739/">@Ji_Maria</a>
I'd agree with some of your points but wanted to add the following:

One general remark on assists: I think it's a skewed stats because it does not reflect the skills of the passer but is inherently linked to the finishing skills of the team mate taking the shot. The passer has next to no influence on that. Therefore, a more accurate reflection of a playmaker is his tally of all key passes (shot assists), not just goal assists.
One general remark on such stats: They should be adjusted to the time a player was on the field. Appearances are not enough in my book, as 1 appearance can be 90+ minutes, less than 3 and anything in between.

Specific remark on Januzaj: If you look at his key passes per 90 minutes during his spell in Dortmund, he wasn't actually that bad, although it goes without saying that stats from subs (attacking midfielders or strikers) are often better than of those who regularly start.

It's a pity that no website seems to provide the numbers for at least the pass of the second (shot) assists or the ones before. It would be much more insightful than just the key pass.

In October 2014, someone from Statsbomb looked at the players involved in the last four passes of a shot for all EPL sides, and also how reliant clubs are on certain players. <a class="externalLink" href="http://statsbomb.com/2014/10/attacking-contribution-metric-and-man-uniteds-reliance-on-di-maria/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://statsbomb.com/2014/10/attacking-contribution-metric-and-man-uniteds-reliance-on-di-maria/</a>

Granted, the cut-off of last four passes is arbitrary but the general idea is superior to any of the over-simplistic key pass stats, let alone goal assist stats.

2080~~~
Top post, this guy knows what he is talking about.

2081~~~
I hate using stats to prove my point, but statistically as well you are wrong. You can't be comparing Januzaj's stats of last season vs the others' stats of this season. Its 50% this season, which I think is better than Martial this season. Also, his key passes are more than others, also Mata has been dispossessed among least no. of times. So, this season Mata and Januzaj>Martial. And Mata has statistically lost ball fewer times than Januzaj, and Januzaj most key cances, so Mata on RW and Januzaj #10? Since all stats (including Goals/minutes) except assists point Januzaj is better than Martial this season and we shouldn't rely on the past, how about convincing people than Martial has had a worse season than most others

2082~~~
How am I wrong. In 2014-15, Januzaj had either a 27% if you listen to ESPN or 39% if you look at whoscored. The 2014-15 Januzaj, the last we consistently saw of him, he was absolutely dire. Full stop.

Stop with the strawman argument of isolating Januzaj comparison to Martial. Martial is a striker who has been shunted out wide to accomodate Rooney for most of the season, and yet has lit the EPL up with goals and assists, so of course Martial isn't going to be a great passer or making key passes, and since he is essentially playing as a second striker of course he is going to be disposed a lot and lose the ball a lot since his job is to beat defenders in the box and score goals/assists, which he is fantastic at. Mind you he is still doing a fantastic job from the wings.

That doesn't even consider the fact that all stats also point towards 2014-15 Januzaj being statistically FAR worse than any of Lingard/Martial/Depay/Rashford/Mata. If you want to say I shouldn't use 2014-15 statistics, that's a bit silly because 2015-16 he has hardly played for MUFC or Dortmund. Looking at the 5 key metrics for an attacking player below, Januzaj ranks at the very bottom for 3, is near the bottom for 1, and is only saving grace is between half to 1 extra key pass per 90 minutes than his competitors. So what are you saying? Because Januzaj makes anywhere between <b>0.1 to 1 extra key pass every 90 minutes </b>he is somehow statistically better than Martial, Mata, Memphis, Lingard despite being the only player out of the lot to not score any goals and assists, having the worst ability to beat his man and a middling pass completion rate (coupled with low number of passes to begin with)? Again, statistically, on most attacking metrics, Januzaj is either dead last or near the bottom. But yeah, 0.1-1 extra key passes EVERY 90 MINUTES makes up for all that <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> And this doesn't even begin to address why he can't score goals or create assists, despite the fact that even Ross Fing Barkley (same age) is scoring goals/assists.

<b>Goals (Januzaj worst)</b>
Martial - 10
Mata - 6
Memphis - 5
Lingard - 4
Januzaj - 0

<b>Assists (Januzaj tied for worst with Memphis)</b>
Mata - 7

2083~~~
I agree with this, but our problem is that shots are NOT being taken. We're not even creating chances for our strikers to even take a shot on goal let alone finish them. Which for me, is de facto evidence that our creativity and ability to create chances is a mess. We keep saying Januzaj is some magical playmaker who can create chances and openings with his superb talent. Frankly, if that was the case, why are we struggling to even take a shot on goal? Why do we finish games with 1 shot on target? Where are all these chances and key passes that are being made?

I mean, did we already forget last season (in which Januzaj played over 1,000 minutes average 49 minutes per appearance) of RVP and Falcao basically standing idly around as we struggled to string together a series of passes? How we would play long periods of time in our own half, failing to make a single pass to RVP/Falcao? Or how when we finally did get the ball in their half, Januzaj decides to try to beat 3 defenders or skying a ridiculous shot on goal rather than making the pass, and then losing the ball and us being caught out and struggling to defend against a counter?

If we are seeing stats of these players of this season, then why Januzaj of last season? And if we are saying Januzaj is poor becasue of lack of goals, his goals/game ratio is better than that of Martial. So statistically Martial<Januzaj as per your logic

2085~~~
Since we just played a game in which a youngster scored a winner against bitter rivals City away, let's do a walk through the past.

I bring you, 2014 MUFC - MCFC at the Etihad (Oliver ref), where we have young Januzaj starting. Just a few of the comments before he was subbed off.

Exhibit A: Januzaj handed big-game start to earn his place, and fails.

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/matches/manchester-city-vs-manchester-united.15/">http://www.redcafe.net/matches/manchester-city-vs-manchester-united.15/</a>

<b>"feck. Januzaj snatched at it."</b>
"That was a very nice piece of play and from that angle Adnan should be burying that."
"Januzaj should have scored that . No excuses. You have to take chances like that in these games."
"Adnan has to do better there the counter was on"
"Shite from Adnan."
<b>"pass the ball januzaj"
"FFS adnan"</b>
"Adnan, Rooney, ADM, wake the feck up for feck's sake, setting up every counter for city."
"Januzaj has stalled play time and time again. Our right wing is horrible."
"Januzaj dilly dallying around."
"Januzaj piss me off sometimes."
<b>"That would have been Adnans fault for fecking about and not making the simple pass"</b>
"<b>His carelessness almost cost us a goal. De Gea did well there."</b>
"Januzaj has been so far off the pace you'd think he was the safety car. Too many attacks breaking down out right for us and leading to City counters. De Gea saving us."
"Awful plays from Di Maria and Januzaj for those two chances"
"Januzaj offers nothing"
<b>"We need to stop giving the ball away in the final third FFS. </b>That's where all the problems are coming from. Januzaj, Rooney and ADM all guilty of this."
"The way things are going, Januzaj is more likely to become the next Nani than the next Ronaldo."
"Literally all Januzaj and Valencia are doing is dillydallying on the ball."
"Januzaj's been ineffective on the right."
"Januzaj is looking off the pace here, we need Herrera in."
<b>"Stop giving the fecking ball away!"</b>
"We need Herrera for Januzaj ASAP. Otherwise, De Gea won't be able to save us the entire match."
"Januzaj doesn't even attempt to go for the header there. Get him off"
"Januzaj has been poor."
<b>" I don't think he possesses the speed/physicality needed to play as a modern winger."</b>
"Not making anything from these cross field balls. Hasn't competed for one yet. Also lacks pace to be a winger imo"
"Valencia and januzaj has been really shit today"
"Adnan has been poor."

<a class="username" data-user="94829, @anant" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/94829/">@anant</a> About that 1.9 killer passes/90 minutes...

2086~~~
Stop making strawmans. Do I really have to spell it out for you?
1) Januzaj has been dropped by LVG for 2015-16 so we have almost no data to compare. Januzaj has played 141 minutes for MUFC this season in 2 appearances in 2015-16.
2) Januzaj has been dropped in favour of Mata/Lingard/Memphis/Martial/Rashford
3) Januzaj has been dropped because of his dire 2014-15 season, in which he had plenty of chances

My query: Was dropping Januzaj this season a correct decision?
My hypothesis: I'm trying to establish that based off of 2014-15 Januzaj, that all of Martial/Mata/Lingard/Memphis/Rashford are currently offering more than what Januzaj offered in 2014-15 and therefore dropping Januzaj in favor of other youth players was a good decision.

And to be clear, I'm not making any conclusions or statements that Martial<Januzaj at all. I am saying statistically, Januzaj of 2014-15 was absolutely dire and far worse than either Martial/Mata/Lingard/Memphis/Rashford are doing this season under key attacking metrics. This is the only conclusion I am coming to. All this other stuff you keep repeating, I don't know how you jumped to those conclusions. Martial/Memphis/Rashford/Lingard are all getting their first chance this season, and are doing far better than Januzaj of 2014-15, when he had his chance last season.

Also, Januzaj has scored 5 goals and 4 assits in over 3,000 minutes played for MUFC. Martial has 12 goals and 4 assists in under 3,000 minutes played for MUFC. In what world does Januzaj have a better goals ratio than Martial? If you want to compare just EPL, Martial has 7 goals and 3 assists in 2084 minutes this year (1 goal every 297 minutes). Januzaj in his best ever season has 4 goals and 3 assists in 1,641 minutes (1 goal ever 410 minutes). In a goal scoring/creation perspective, Martial is far better than Januzaj ever was at his peak, and the scary thing is, Martial wasn't even playing as a striker half the time. A more fair comparison would be against Mata, Lingard, Memphis and maybe Rashford. Statistically, the 2014-15 Januzaj is worse than all 4 of them as well. Now do I think Memphis or Lingard are better players than Januzaj? No. I think a peak Januzaj (13-14 form) offers more than Memphis and possibly more than Lingard. The problem is, Januzaj's most recent form has been awful, and MUFC is not a charity that has some obligation to give players a chance to "play into form." You either show it in training or whatever chances are handed to you, or you go sit on the bench.

And not a single Januzaj supporter has even begun to address the fact that similar players to him on not only our team, but on any other team (including Ross Fing Barkley) are consistently scoring goals and assists. The speak of an "obvious" talent, which sure was apparent in 2013-14, but we haven't seen at all in the past 2 years. And I posted a matchday thread from 2014-15 above just in case you needed a reminder of how he was consistently one of the worst players on the pitch for us that season.

And for the love of Pete stop saying you hate using statistics when that's all you have been throwing around this thread (you're the one who showed me how to use whoscored.com for crying out loud). They don't tell the whole story but at the same time we need something to dispel this false notion that Januzaj is still the same player he was in 2013-14. Since some of you are too darn lazy to read old matchday threads or rewatch games, I have done that for you in my above post (MUFC vs. MCFC where poor Januzaj who never gets a fair chance actually started) to refresh your memory, and have also given plenty of statistics (for whatever they're worth) showing that not only is he losing the ball and doing feck all with his chances (see MCFC game above, I can post many many more from the dire 2014-15 campaign), he is also failing to score, failing to create assists, and failing to dribble past defenders (28% or 39% depending on which source you want to believe).

2013-14 Januzaj was good, everyone knows that. 14-15 was very poor. What does that say about Januzaj now? I don't know. It's 50/50 whether he will continue his poor 14-15 form or return to 13-14. One of those two seasons was a fluke. Your guess is as good as mine which one it is. But to assume that 13-14 is the "real" Januzaj is foolish since there is absolutely no way to know unless he plays, and right now, neither LVG nor Dortmund thought Januzaj worthy of a shot at playing. Either you're wrong, or LVG and Dortmund are wrong, and there's nothing wrong with that since people make bad judgments all the time. But don't blindly assume that Januzaj will come good given the chance because in reality nobody knows for sure and at best it's a 50/50 gamble.

2087~~~
Obviously he has a lot of talent but as of now, there is no way he deserves to start over any of our attackers. They all have their purposes. Martial and Rashford are in better form and seem to play well mostly when they play. Lingard is tactically disciplined and is a decent finisher. He is faster and has a slightly better decision making now. Mata is more creative and seems to be in form too. At best, he can come on after 70 mins or so. Unless he does something extra ordinary in those cameos, he wouldnt start.

2088~~~
All I'm pointing out is his form in the few appearances he has had isn't that bad. It's pretty unfair to use stats of januzaj of last season and compare them to stats of others of this season. 
His stats when he was loaned out were possibly the most impressive that time-he was our top scorer afterall, and it had been 4 games excluding the pre season friendlies(where he was impressive) which is although not long enough to say that the player is class, but is long enough to say that the player is talentless.
He has never been a goalscorer, he has always been a decent dribbler and while his dribble success rate wasn't great last season, it has been pretty this season. And yeah, by goals/minutes, I was referring to this season only.
So the obvious question arises, a)  Is the team selection this season based on last season's form? If yes, then why Lingard over Januzaj. Lingard had done nothing last season, and even if we account for the Lingard's injury, then why Lingard over Januzaj in the 1st game of last season?
And if no, then why was Januzaj loaned despite him being in promising form this season?
As far as my use of stats is concerned, I have used these sites earlier to prove that stats comparison is a hopeless way to my friends.
No one is saying he should start over Mata or Martial, nor Rashford on given form, and maybe not Lingard because of the workrate vs City. But he does deserve a lot more minutes that he is being offered now

2089~~~
I'm with you, I don't see Januzaj as the remedy for United's drought in that department. My point was that a more insightful look is necessary than just looking at goal assists (and number of appearances), and that Januzaj's stats at Dortmund in that regard aren't as poor as I subjectively perceived them.

2090~~~
I think he'll be sold in the summer.

I rate him and think he should be given a chance, but it's not going to happen sadly.

2091~~~
I think what obviously happened is LVG gave Januzaj a real shot last year, he failed, so now he is giving other youngsters a chance. These other youngsters are doing very well. The ones who arent doing well (Memphis) have also been benched.

Januzaj deserves nothing. He was absolute shiite last season and this season he was so bad that Dortmund refused to play him even for free and sent him home early. When was the last time a player from a top team on loan was sent home early (other tham injury recalls) for crying out loud. I mean how much does a team have to hate a player to end a loan early?

Listen i dont mean to sound harsh or hostile. I get your point and obviously we have differeing opinions. I say again I rate the 13-14 Januzaj but not the 14-15 Januzaj. I also dont want him walking back in the team and take chances away from Lingard or Rashford unless he shows the right attitude in training and really takes his chances this time around.

2092~~~
<a class="username" data-user="96646, @Crossie" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/96646/">@Crossie</a> <a class="username" data-user="52625, @do.ob" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/52625/">@do.ob</a> Is this poster even correct about Januzaj this season? Because, his mind partially being in Manchester as your manager said aside, whenever I saw him he looked fairly good. Definitely nothing like some of the shocking performances we saw from Memphis this season.

2093~~~
I didn't think he looked good early in the year. First game of the season he scored a nice goal. Other than that I thought he was pretty average to poor, making a lot of bad decisions. I'd agree he didn't do as badly as some of the terrible performances we saw from Memphis. However, I'd also say he didn't do as well, or anywhere near as well, as some of the great performances (albeit few and far between) we saw from Memphis. You also have to give some leeway to the fact Memphis is coming into a new league & country, in my opinion.
But at the end of the day, we haven't seen much of Memphis for a while, so it's not like he's flavour of the month either.

2094~~~
with this thread... i have created a monster.

2095~~~
Right now his biggest problem is LVG. He sees him as a striker of sorts and he really isn't. He did the same thing with Nani before he sent him packing and is doing the same thing with Memphis though Memphis of the 3 is the closest to that. 

He is not an out and out goal scorer but, can score goals but, his biggest strengths are his ability on the ball. He needs to be played either as a wide forward or as pseudo-#10 with a license to roam on either wing and get beyond the striker as needed. But, as I said - don't think LVG will use him like that, so he needs to bide his time till he gets a manager that will use him in the right way.

2096~~~
Depends on what you expect. He showed a lot of promising moments and never looked terrible, because you could always see his talent in handlong the ball, but on the flipside it also never seemed as though he fully grasped what Dortmunds football is about.
So I wouldn't rule out that Tuchel saw him as a lost cause in terms of mental attributes (understanding/reading of situations and the game or positional awareness).

2097~~~
That's what I always felt when I saw him, which is why that posters comments were suprising.

2098~~~
Still young enough that 2 wasted seasons can be overcome but the odds are slimmer than ever now. If we sell Mata, I think he can get his chance but with Lingard, Memphis, and likely new signings on the wings I can't see him getting a chance out wide.

2099~~~
Where <a class="username" data-user="92739, @Ji_Maria" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/92739/">@Ji_Maria</a> is wrong: Dortmund sent Januzaj home. That's not correct. It was Januzaj's wish to return earlier, and in the end, Dortmund gave in. Most probably because two boys from our academy who can play on the wing were ready for their debut and Tuchel deemed the risk of playing two eager 17-year olds manageable.

Regarding Januzaj's performance, I'm not as positive as do.ob but not as negative as  Ji_Maria either. I thought that Januazaj's performances were overall okay-ish, with some better moments, but also many selfish moments (e.g. unnecessary dribblings, shooting when passing would have been better) or in which his positional play was poor. In his last match for Dortmund, the whole team played shite but he managed to stand out negatively. That - and because it was one of the few games in which Januzaj started - may be the reason why the overall memory of Januzaj's performance is negative.

2100~~~
Some people don't realize that you can't just use stats to judge very young players with their tendency to be inconsistent.Just...well...watch them perhaps and have your own opinion.

2101~~~
Absolutely. I don't think anyone will advocate that he was amazing for Dortmund or anything, but apart from the last match which I heard was awful, generally it was the case of a young player whose ability and class on the ball was obvious, but who also struggled to impose himself on games, have the end product matching his talent and of course needed to improve his decision making, as is often the case with young kids.

My point was that he wasn't "so bad" for Dortmund. "So bad" for me were the performances Memphis was consistently putting out for good stretches of this season, where you wondered if he was actually a PL level player. Everyone has seen those displays, where a player looks lost and unfit for the stage he's playing at. Januzaj gets that tag even when he's alright.

That's why I think the Januzaj discussion seems to oscillate between the silly and the ridiculous. The average performances he puts out are viewed as abominations. MAybe it has to do with how good he was in 13/14 but it's slightly unfair IMO.

2102~~~
Absolutely. I was in fact going to write earlier that these "stat-fests", while are useful, are more appropriate when comparing more experienced/established players.

2103~~~
<a class="username" data-user="4910, @amolbhatia50k" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/4910/">@amolbhatia50k</a>
I get your point, I think. As a more neutral person, I'm under the impression though that some users are so in love with the idea that a United academy player plays an important role that Januzaj's talent and game is always judged upon very generously. I'm obviously exaggerating but it seems at it's never Januzaj's fault that he doesn't get as many minutes as he wants to or if he's not playing that well: It's the coach, the role, team mates, stellar constellation, whatever. A bit like those parents who are convinced their kid is a genius and come up with all sorts of excuses why it isn't obvious to everyone. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

Talent alone doesn't cut it in football, Januzaj is so far a prime example for that.

2104~~~
I think there is some real amount of confusion over here with people arguing over various things:

Set 1: People who think Januzaj has immense talent to be getting starts for Utd

Set 2: Januzaj should be given more starts because Utd were patient with Memphis and Lingard who clearly are not doing any better if not worse

Set 3: Januzaj has been tried and does not have what it takes to be a good Utd player. Almost everyone is at his level or more.

Set 4: Januzaj has been bang average and does not seem to have the attitude to be any better. So no point in giving him a chance.

2105~~~
Personally I definitely think a lot of it is down to him. He has to make his career after all, he is never going to get to the top without proving he's a top player. At the same time,  I do think we have a place in our squad and starts on a rotational basis, for him. Especially in the state we have been this season. We give to starts to Fellaini ffs <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2106~~~
Fellaini is starting because LvG sees something useful in him (based on the great game plan) which no one else sees. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
Firstly, we have to finalize Januzaj's best position and analyze his competitors for the spot. Is it on RW (Lingard, Mata) or in the middle (Mata again, sometimes Rooney, sometimes Herrera)

2107~~~
I'm asking because I simply don't know. Isn't a loan contract a bilateral agreement between the lending team and the receiving team? I.e., you set a fixed period, payment terms, and basically that player becomes the receiving team's player until the end of the term?

Even if Januzaj didn't want to play and was clamoring to go back, Dortmund could have held on to him and held him (and MUFC) to his contract, from my understanding. Just like how we were stuck with Falcao for the entire season and how Chelsea are stuck with him now (despite him being out injured and never playing).

I mean, if Dortmund rated Januzaj, why wouldn't they hold onto him at least as a backup? What does Dortmund have to lose by holding onto Januzaj? I think the following quote really says it all: "It is a pity he did not show the desire and attitude you need to progress at his age"

And yeah, I apologize for being overly harsh on Januzaj. I really rated him in 2013-14, and what I hate most in football are players who have talent and squander it with a poor attitude or sense of entitlement.

2108~~~
Taking that into account, I think he should have been kept this season and given gametime. Our options in the the #10 and RW position are bang average.

2109~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> I know, it's ... interesting. Has any journalist ever probed LvG as to what he sees in Fellaini? Specific skills? Tactical understanding? Whatever?

Correct.
It isn't reported that Januzaj didn't want to play. He didnt get game time and was, naturally, unhappy about it. Some time in November, I'd say, first reports appeared that Tuchel was seriously annoyed with his attitude in training. Around the same time, rumors appeared that Januzaj could return to United already in winter. That's when the DoF said they have no intention to let him return earlier.
Tuchel rated Januzaj's talent. With his attitude and wish to return to MUFC, however, it wasn't worth to hold on to him. Why invest in a player who won't be playing for you beyond the summer if you have two hopeful prospects from your own academy who are itching to prove themselves and will (hopefully) be with the club for a longer time?

2110~~~
If there is a change of manager then he will more than likely stay. He seems to be highly regarded by the club itself (Giggs/Joyce, Coaches and co.) but not by Van Gaal.

2111~~~
I think that he tried to do that was a big part of his struggles. He looked completely out of sync with his teammates and tried to impose himself on games when that's not what the manager wanted from him or what the team needed from him.

My impression was that he was good in the first few weeks at Dortmund despite fitness issues, because he was just playing his own game and because he was used in less important matches against weaker opponents (he only started EL group stage matches, never in a domestic game) or as a sub late in games. And because he was new to the team, everyone gave him some leeway and was excited because his talent on the ball isn't in question. It got consistently worse from there though. He never clicked with his teammates, got less and less playing time when the games became more important and looked less confident. You would have expected him to understand the tactics better and fit in better with every passing month, but that never happened. Even quality individual moments became very rare. There were rumours at a time that he struggled to understand and adapt to Tuchel's tactics and looking at his time at Dortmund and under van Gaal, that might actually be a really big problem. It wasn't just his decision making on the ball that was mostly awful, his movement off the ball, his positioning in Dortmund's pressing were completely off as well. He was constantly in the wrong place.

Maybe his talent is big enough to overcome these issues under a manager who prefers a more individualistic approach in attack. Mourinho would certainly fall into this category, he builds his teams around defensive organisation and tactical freedom in attack. Though even Mourinho demands discipline and defensive workrate from his attacking players.

2112~~~
Hopefully all of it falls into place under the nexy manager. He's got so much ability on the ball it would be a shame for that to be wasted due him lacking tactically.

It's interesting though because SAF's whole football model, while did of course require hard work and effort was to let attackers lose and give them freedom to take charge, as well give them attacking leeway. So in a sense it's possibly also Januzaj's education of being more individualistic which affects him negatively under LVG or a system oreinted team like Dortmund. At the same time, you'd expect a Paul Scholes or Evra or any top player to adapt to whatever the manager needs, tactically. So the onus on him to prove he's not just a player that's "good on the ball" but a "good footballer".

2113~~~
His most stupid decision was to go on loan to Dortmund of all places. And it's also LVG's and United's fault for agreeing to it even if he insisted.

He was starting for United actually in every game almost before LVG decided suddenly to loan him, so i think it came as a surprise to Januzaj given his comments and his Ego he wanted to go to a strong team like Dortmund to prove him wrong.

He should have gone to lower team where he would have been given time and individualistic leeway with others putting in the shift for him. At Dortmund he didn't fit in tactically and let's be honest they never had the patience to bear his inconsistencies like they might do with their own youngsters.

If he had 1 really bad game like his last one he was dropped for a while. When infact he did have potential to have a very good game the next match.

2114~~~
I'd agree with this to an extent. However, there are plenty of us who did do this, judged him with our own eyes, and thought he was being hugely overrated on here. But, you can't say that to his supporters or you get "You're an idiot if you can't see his ability" type responses. Yep, we can see the guy has ability. But, we can also see his decision making has been generally appalling, he has been selfish as <a class="username" data-user="96646, @Crossie" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/96646/">@Crossie</a> mentioned above he also was in regard to his Dortmund performances, and his recent performances for us have not warranted inclusion. Yet, we're constantly hit with "He deserves a shot" or "Louis is a joke for not playing him" or "It's criminal that he doesn't get a shot".

Like I said, we can then point out that he really hasn't influenced games (bar a nice finish in the Villa game) for 2 years. But that's met with the usual "You're an idiot if you can't see his ability". At this point, I can understand why people bring up stats. It's something at least concrete.

2115~~~
This! Oh my God, so this. Well put Crossie.

This is absolutely the way I feel it. It's the Welbeck syndrome all over again. Just because he's an academy graduate, he's hugely overhyped in my opinion.

2116~~~
This isn't far off correct I'd say, regarding the pieces. I'd say there's a few things I'd disagree with. 

2: I think Lingard has been doing better than Adnan. Lingard isn't spectacular, but he's very solid. Also, gets into positions to set things up, and to score goals. I think Adnan's biggest problem is that he messes things up a lot by trying too much, trying to beat too many players, being selfish etc. I think if people think Lingard isn't doing better than Adnan, they're thinking about year 1 Adnan, not years 2 and 3. Memphis had his great moments. I think it's unfair not to recognise that. Don't get me wrong, he was absolutely abysmal at times, but he did have some great moments. It's been a long time since Adnan did. Even still, we're not seeing much of Memphis these days, so I don't feel he's being treated much differently to Adnan. We also don't know how both of their attitudes are, and there have been huge rumblings as to Adnan's bad attitude, from more than 1 source, so this could be a very big reason Memphis gets on the bench more, and gets more minutes. He could also be showing more in training.

4: I wouldn't say no point giving him a chance. I think people feel he has to earn it. He has to show it in training, then he has to take his chances when given them in the first team. This is probably the camp I'm in, in that regard. I do feel the guy has tons of ability. But he needs to learn to use it, and he needs to grab his chance. I definitely don't feel he deserves a shot, just because of his ability.

2117~~~
He's one poor pre-season away from being shipped out. 

What a disappointment this guy has been in the last couple of years. I thought we struck gold in his first season, but it looks like he's just another Kiko Macheda.

2118~~~
Put it this way, if his name was Adam James instead of Adnan Januzaj, he'd probably get the Tom Cleverley treatment.

2119~~~
No he wouldn't.

No-one cares about people's names.

2120~~~
Nope.

2121~~~
I dont know, I feel people are more lenient on players that are not British for some reason... not so much here on the caf but just generally.

2122~~~
Something needs to happen for him now. He either steps up and starts playing more for United, or he will be loaned or even sold

2123~~~
Needs to be actually played to do that.

2124~~~
I have lost all hope. I don't see any reason why young is on the bench ahead of him. He's probably going to go this summer. 

This will be even worse than Pogba since this kid has actually proven himself on the premier league level stage. Unless this is about his attitude which I highly doubt it is (he seemed very professional on the pitch at least) we will regret this.

2125~~~
It's LvG trying to be stubborn. If a player crosses him once it's curtains for them. Sometimes the manager has to put their hands around young player even after scolding, to get the best out of them. I'd rather he puts confidence in players like Januzaj and Pereira than in Young, Valencia and Fellaini; players that are past their peaks. LvG is quickly becoming the potential killer!

2126~~~
It is ridiculous. Januzaj was first and now we're seeing it with Peraira.

2127~~~
No problem, LVG's great at developing youth.

2128~~~
It will be great when he leaves us and we keep the likes of Valencia and Young for another few years. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

2129~~~
Well, Januzaj wil never come close to Pogba's level but to see im so far behind Young, Valencia et al is a bit soul destroying. Young, Valencia and Fellaini are on the bench ahead of him. Ouch.

2130~~~
Valencia is not on the bench ahead of him. Valencia is a RB, Adnan is not.

2131~~~

2132~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2133~~~
yup. as per sam luckhurst/MEN it's the reason he wasn't on the bench (not that that's any solace at this point, seeing as he needs to play either here or somewhere else at this point) at the weekend. nevermind the bollocks of him being dropped by the u21's.

nevertheless, this just once again shows how bad his attitude is and how we need to get rid of him.

...

2134~~~
Exactly, What an a-hole, why didn't he stretch properly before walking around on the pitch. Poor attitude

2135~~~
Not even in the squad for the U21s tonight - he really is out in the cold!

2136~~~
He is injured.

2137~~~
Ah right!

2138~~~
I doubt he will get any minutes the rest of the season. With his injuries and the importance of the remaining games, only "trusted" players will be playing. This season has been a total loss for him.

2139~~~
We need to keep hold of him, and try him on the right. Some take the chances very young, some don't. We don't want a Pogba repeat.

He's clearly a great talent. He's got the touch, the finishing, the ability to dribble and beat his man, the eye for a beautiful pass. Now he's bulked up, too, so he'll be stronger. 
People forget how he was carrying the team during the Moyes' fiasco. He deserves more chances at this club, and a new manager will help him. This year went horribly wrong, and he's made wrong decisions both on and off the pitch. He shouldn't have gone to Dortmund, he shouldn't have showboated for the U21s. But he must get more chances.

We haven't seen a front three of Martial-Marcus-Adnan yet. I think that can be a great combination, since Adnan is clearly a step-up from Lingard. Before going after the Mahrezes and the Sanes, we need to give Adnan Januzaj a chance first.

2140~~~
Is he still alive? 

Haven't heard about him in ages.

2141~~~
This 

It's ridiculous how ungrateful or forgetful the CAF can be. When he emerged as an 18 year old,  he was literally our go to man in a disastrous campaign. The only shining light in that season. 

A few mishaps later,  many give up on him at 21! I really do fear for the likes of Rashford, TFM et al in this place of they have a bad period

2142~~~
I agree. Would love to see him on the right wing, in the system we're currently playing.

2143~~~
Yeah it'd be great to see him given a shot in place of Linford in this setup. 0 goals and 0 assists in the past... 11 matches I believe is not enough from Lingard considering he's pretty much played the full 90.

Problem is Januzaj has had a hamstring injury for some time now... it's not as though he's been entirely frozen out. Nevertheless time is pretty much out for this season.

2144~~~
I would also go on and say that he was may more impressive than Rashford (saying something) and TFM. 

The boy had world class written all over him. Honestly he needs to be played or we will lose another top talent.

2145~~~
He is still injured.

2146~~~
This. I agree there is a responsibility of the player to apply himself but it's way too early to write him off. I remember were said to be sniffing around and we rejected any offer. The coaching staff also have a responsibility to make sure young talents reach their potential. I guess it's a lack of full time staff to commit to developing individual talents. 

His attitude can't be that bad either. I'm sure he took a PT along with him on holiday, same with Shaw, to fight for a spot in the team. This in itself should not be a big deal but the current climate of over pampered footballers, I'd say that is impressive.

2147~~~
He didn't make much of an impression on loan and is far from being an option today. I think he can still make it at the club. Sometimes players just need some time to grow and when they're ready to play a manager like LVG will be there and make sure that happens.

To me it's obvious he's got attitude problems. Looks lazy and thinks too highly of himself. Perhaps that will change.

2148~~~
At least there is no chance of that happening with Mourinho in charge.

2149~~~
He wasn't better than rashford though. He wasn't any good against the top teams. He showed talent but didn't win us important games like rashford.

2150~~~
He was literally carrying that shambolic side as an 18 year old.

2151~~~
Hugely overated by some, potential yes but has not lived up to it as of yet.

2152~~~
Against the smaller sides. I can't remember him doing a lot against the bigger teams. He was excellent vs Sunderland Southampton Aston villa and all. Rashford won us games vs city and Arsenal for instance. It's highly debatable januzaj was better than rashford that season. 

He wasn't carrying the team anyway. He was an integral player yes and sometimes our only bright spark but carrying the team that season? No way. Carrying would mean something Suarez did or at least what martial did this season.

2153~~~
Januzaj's influence on the whole team was much gretaer than you have asserted, regardless the team's that we were up against. Carrying a team does not mean that you carry them to success but being the inspiration the team turns to. It may be 2 seasons ago but Januzaj's influence was that epic, in a team that contained Rooney, RvP, Nani et al. He broke into a team not as a result of injuries iirc. No doubt he has failed off a bit but let's not underplay his effort then.

2154~~~
Yes he inspired us in a few games yes but not an entire season. And the games he inspired were mostly against the likes of Fulham Stoke Sunderland and all.

Anyway the initial point was his 13/14 wasn't better than rashford s current season. Rashford won us games on his own sometimes, much important games that too. So it's highly debatable to call januzaj s first season better.

2155~~~
Except he actually did it on the pitch a few seasons ago. It's not like there's talent that has never been seen.

2156~~~
We finished 7th. Maybe that's just his level.

2157~~~
He did. I cannot speak regarding LvG's criticism but what Thomas Tuchel suggested fitness wasn't the issue with Adnan (at least not at the end of his loan spell). Tuchel has been working almost 10 years as a youth coach in at least three different academies, in the ranks of U15 to U19 teams IIRC. He has helped many young players to establish themselves in his now almost 6 years as head coach. Therefore, I trust that he knows his stuff and judged on Adnan's attitude not prematurely.

2158~~~
Maybe this is too utopic, but I think he needs a father like figure who can guide him into a mentally strong zone. He needs encouragement and grounding at the same time, and a coach with good man-management skills might yet bring out the brilliant footballer in him onto the pitch consistently. The people advising him currently, mainly his agent Dirk Devriese and his father, perhaps need to take a look at how they've approached matters so far.

How we miss Fergie, eh?

2159~~~
And the rest of the squad too? Maybe that's their level too?

2160~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> sound logic.

2161~~~
Well some of them have medals to there name. At the time our level was probably good for his development. Where we are going not so.

2162~~~
Apart from 1 player it was the same team that won the league the season before and if he was the star man that season what does it say that he's potentially better than all the players that won the league.

2163~~~
Good that he wasn't the star man then.

2164~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> exactly, the over hype of his performances that season is immense.

2165~~~
Nah, he's definitely talented. Mentally just not on the required level at the moment.

2166~~~
I agree he is talented, but the over hype of that season under Moyes is incredible.

2167~~~
He should have gone to Everton on loan last summer. Would have been perfect for him.

2168~~~
It's slightly overhyped indeed but he was a real bright spot in that horrific season, and putting in good performances at that age, better than seasoned veterans.

2169~~~
To go from being in the starting lineup against Villa and then loaned out for no reason. What a bizarre year for him.

2170~~~
That you know of.

2171~~~
That anybody know's of.

2172~~~
And end up being benched to make way for Lennon? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2173~~~
The hype that season was justified - atleast the first half of the season. He was able to get past any number of players at will from any position and seemed that he could develop into a special player. But since then opposition defenders have been able to figure him out and he hasn't been able to cope with that. Sad.

2174~~~
I'm talking about people in this thread saying he was our best player that season, total crap.
He was good and has obvious talent.

2175~~~
Yeah, agree with that

2176~~~
Maybe some things are best kept in house, especially when it comes to young players.

I'd say Januzaj and his entourage's lack of moaning about how unfair he has been treated is probably quite telling.

2177~~~
Very good point that - didn't think of it before. They've only come out in self-defense whenever publicly blamed, but never to point fingers. One would imagine that this means that things weren't totally clean and fair on their end. 

Hoping he has a good pre-season with us, and does well next season.

2178~~~
There's clearly a problem somewhere with the likes of Januzaj and Perreira, otherwise both would be playing a lot more this year. If they can't hack it during a year when we are overtly experimenting with kids, then they will never make it here.

2179~~~
True. The reality is that, he had a good season and one of the positives of the campaign. But people talk here like we would have been relegated had he not been there. True he was very very good in a good few games but he never carried us that season.

I think he had a sense of ' I have already achieved a lot' after he was selected by Belgium and we gave him #11 jersey.

2180~~~
Seems to me almost guaranteed to stay for another season. Young, talented, big, long contract but gone off the boil. No other team will match his wages (I seriously doubt) and he'll have all summer to think about this whole football career thing. A new manager, a new attitude and he really could be useful to us. 

He looked a sure thing to make it too - seeing how many matches Lingard has had in 'his' position is just a reminder of what could have been.

2181~~~
I blame that bird he took to Nando's

2182~~~
LVG has ruined Januzaj. Mourinho will finish the job off in the summer.

Real shame. A massive talent that's gone down the drain.

2183~~~
adnan might have/had a bad attitude, but i've never heard anything of the sort to describe perreira.

as for januzaj not playing much, he's been injured for probably half the time he's been here since january. that hasn't helped him at all, but that doesn't change the fact that this season has been a disaster for him despite him having a promising august.

2184~~~
I wasn't suggesting Perreira has an attitude problem. I was suggesting that there is an issue with their development to where LvG has privileged the likes of Rashford and others over them this year.

2185~~~
ah yes, i misunderstood.

2186~~~
Yeah if only he had worked a little harder.

2187~~~
I love the comments. LVG has ruined him. No fault of Januzaj's at all. Joke.

2188~~~
Yep,must be that,what else could it be i wonder.

2189~~~
Because that's what I said.

Januzaj is not blameless but he was a young exciting player who needed nurturing. Putting him on the bench for weeks at a stretch and then playing in random positions is the very last thing a player needs. I blame LVG, yes. He's utterly clueless.

2190~~~
If van Gaal was the problem then Januzaj would've done better at Dortmund.

2191~~~
As I've said many a time, it's up to the player to show it in training. We have no idea what the guy is showing in training .. although, we can get an inkling, given that he didn't cover himself in glory in Dortmund either. For me, he has talent, but I think it's being overstated by some of his bigger fans on here. I think it's becoming pretty clear that he has some form of attitude problem, which hopefully he can get rid of, and go on to use his talents. 

Why shouldn't he be on the bench if he's not performing in training? He was given a chance at the start of the season and he wasn't exactly outstanding. Yes, after that he was moved around a bit. At the same time, it's up to him to prove his worth. He hasn't.

Not the manager's fault in my opinion. All on the player. Van Gaal has proven that he will play youngsters, regardless of age etc, if they display that they deserve it. He's made many sticks, our Louis. "Ruining" Januzaj is not one of them.

2192~~~
While Januzaj is not without blame by any means, if LVG had given Adnan half the chances that Lingard and and Memphis have had this season who knows what could have been this season.

Nevertheless, I always said that Kagawa was overhyped and didn't deliver. A similar thing could be said about our #11. It's on Adnan, it's on every player - any time you get a chance on the pitch, you have to prove that you can't be dropped. Martial and Rashford have done that this year since day 1. They took their opportunity and ran with it. Assuming Januzaj gets another chance next year, he'll have to take it right from the off. No more excuses, whatever they are.

2193~~~
We don't know what he does in training so I really don't see the point in commenting on that. I don't know about others but he's fabulously talented from what I've seen and I don't big up every single youth player like some do. He's the kind of player that needed patience and time, neither of which he was afforded. It hasn't helped him of curse that we've been hell bent on buying players left right and center since he broke through. In a way it's a bad luck that he's broken through in a transitional period for the club.

He was one of our better attaching players at the start of the season. Scored a goal at Villa and one of the only players to actually create chances in the game against Newcastle (Would have had an assist if the linesman had done his job right). Was ok in the games against Brugge. Nothing great overall but certainly nothing in those games suggested he should have been sent out on loan. Last season he was played at Left Wing Back at one point after not been seen for weeks. You can't be telling me that does any good to player.

2194~~~
Exactly. You haven't seen what he's done in training, so how can you conclusively state that Louis has ruined him? That's my point. We don't see what he does in training. Thus we can't say Louis has ruined him. However, we can also see he didn't get in the Dortmund side. And we're clearly hearing about issues of attitude. Those are on the player.

2195~~~
That's just stupid. He played one game as you say, that too it was a game where we were chasing a goal so we put him on in place of the wingback. Doesn't mean we played him as one. It's like suggesting managers who put on a CF for a CB play them as defenders. We put him as a Wingback but his main instruction was to attack. 

At this stage you need to take your chances however small they seem. Lingard got a sub role vs Everton earlier and performed well thereby demanding more games. Januzaj never did that last year even though he could have done so easily if he tried as even young ousted di Maria from the team. 

We wanted to send him on loan so that he gets more games. He looked raw last season and he had lots of areas to develop so he clearly needed him to play week in week out to get more developed. Which we couldn't guarantee here. We ideally wanted him to goto Sunderland or something where he could probably do that but he chose Dortmund and we probably agreed thinking he will go there and fight for his place which will only be good. Except he didn't.

2196~~~
It's annoying that he gets absolutely zero game time.

2197~~~
I never brought up training or attitude because we don't really have a clue what goes on behind the scenes. You did. My complaints with LVG are solely based on how he's been handled with respect to his game time and and nature of it. It's been far from ideal management from LVG imo.

2198~~~
What are you waffling about? And he did play as a WB that game. Absolutely smashing idea to play someone who's not even a proper winger at wing back. It was an awful move from a manager who seems hell bent on doing weird things with team selection for no apparent reason. Wasn't just that though. He's been played all over even in attacking sense. Last season he played on the left wing against Chelsea, was one of our best players and what does LVG do? Put him on the the right wing for the next game. He spends pre-season playing as a CF and then bang goes straight in as the #10 when season starts.Then then there's the scattered nature of his game time last season. You can't just keep leaving him out for weeks at a time and then expect him to impress straight back in. Not every player can do that. Not even experienced players can let alone young creative players like Januzaj who need that time patience.

No idea why you bring up Lingard. I have no problem with him playing. What I have a problem is with Januzaj not playing AT ALL and the one time he did come on he came on at LB. It's not like Januzaj was terrible in the 2 or 3 games he did play at the start. Scored a goal, created chances and got sent out on loan. LVG is clueless.

Give him a good run and see how he does, like he's given Memphis. If he's still shit after all that, fair play.

2199~~~
Yes, I know we know nothing about it. I'm not sure how you can form an opinion that the nature and amount of his game time is a fault of LVG without knowing about what goes on regarding his attitude and his training. Say he's a miserable, sulky, spoiled git. Who does nothing in training. Should he play? Should he automatically be given game time just because he showed fleeting amounts of quality 2 years ago? 

Nope, in my opinion we can't form opinions on this without knowing the full story. He didn't break into the Dortmund team, he's not breaking into ours. Is LVG the common denominator, or is Adnan?

2200~~~
LvG would be a poor coach if he rewarded a poor attitude in training with game time. I've never been a fan of LvG but here, I can hardly fathom how much stick he gets for the lack of ambition by a youngster who obviously thinks thanks to his talent, the rules of competition shouldn't apply to him.

2201~~~
Any evidence for this?

2202~~~
You see, now I know you're just biased towards Adnan. He was dreadful in that game. I was wondering was I mis-remembering somehow, so I went and looked. On the Barclays website, Barclays Fan Rating, he is 2nd worst United player on 4.68. Smalling on 3.64 was the worst, with Fellaini coming close, on 4.69. Daily Mail had him 2nd worst (I know, daily mail is terrible! But I'm struggling to find player ratings). Goal.com had him middle of the pack. BBC middle of the pack (with a lot of players on 6).

2203~~~
You must be talking about a different game. Either that or the Barclays fan site is full of cnuts. Fellaini and Smalling were our two best defensive players that game as I remember it. Januzaj was one of the best players going forward and played a couple of lovely passes and gave Ivanovic a tough time.

2204~~~
I just had it open but I closed it, he got about a 6.3 rating on here, 7th or 8th in the team ahead of Di Maria and Mata. Received mostly positive reviews in his match thread, created a few chances and supposedly should have had an assist.

2205~~~
To be fair, that Barclays site could well be full of cnuts. I was struggling to find good ratings sites. Again, my recollection might not be great all the same. My memory was that he had an OK 1st half, and had Ivanovic looking a bit shell shocked at times. But he made quite a few bad decisions and multiple times could have cut inside but chose to stay outside. And from what I recall he completely disappeared in the second half.

2206~~~
I just checked the caf ratings. Fellaini was MoM on here so safe to Barclays fan site is full of cnuts.

Januzaj also played a lovely through ball to send RVP through (he missed). He's very inconsistent no doubt, even within games, but he does produce lots of good moments for us to persist with him. You don't get the best out such players by playing them once in a while (see Nani). If the team were playing well, then yeah fair enough but we're on course for our worst attacking season.

2207~~~
Feels like there is only one way left for this kid now... The exit.

2208~~~
He dominated U21 level 2 years ago at a level i've not seen since Giussepe Rossi.

Clearly not arsed anymore at that level and probably thinks he doesn't have a chance with LVG anyway. Let alone playing as a striker in a team full of defenders.

We'd still be stupid to sell him though especially when his market value is down.


But gotta wonder about his future especially if LVG stays along with Pereira and maybe even Wilson. 3 of our biggest talents.

2209~~~
He wasn't that bad today... was surprised to read the story. Nevertheless I'm biased so don't take it from me.

<a class="username" data-user="88339, @FromTheBench" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/88339/">@FromTheBench</a> nailed it IMO

2210~~~
I honestly believe if van Gaal stays all 3 will be gone this summer, I don't think any of them would want to continue working under him. 3 of our most talented academy attackers who have not been given the chance they deserve or developed under his guidance. It's 1 of the reason why I want LVG out asap and also a reason why I'm losing interest in UTD altogether, I don't like the direction the club is going in. We are no longer an attacking team, we play a very defensive game, the philosophy is to nullify the opponent, Defending is put first and attack is secondary, we no long set up to out gun our opponents and it's sad to see. We have an extremely good youth setup that can reap rewards for many years but they won't get to see the light of day at UTD under this fraud. Wilson, Januzaj, Pereira, Goss, Rashford, Martial, Mensah and Gribbin (Midfield +attakers) have the potential to be at the very top for a long time but....

2211~~~
On the first team bench today. Good news.

2212~~~
Looking at that bench he is pretty much the only attacking substitution we can make, will come on today I fancy. Go on Adnan!

2213~~~
So glad he's on the bench. Hoping he can come on and make an impact. Guess he will need to, as it looks like he's pretty far down in the pecking order when it comes to attacking positions.

2214~~~
LVG has to be clowning him. Gets him up off the bench, ready to go in, and then pulls him off before he even gets in the game.

2215~~~
Poor guy. Not sure how anyone bar Martial and Rashford start ahead of him.

2216~~~
Van Gaal has taken the piss with him today. Idiotic management.

2217~~~
Well  Mata scored.. so change of plans for the first time.. looks like Carrick was injured second time he was about to come in

2218~~~
Carrick got injured; the feck did you want us to do?

2219~~~
Absolute bullshit from LVG

2220~~~
Good performance. Cant fault the warm-up. Was ready to come on on two separate occasions. Can't ask for more from your substitutes.

2221~~~
Let him on for Carrick. 

We've already had Schneiderlin on the pitch anyway, we've played with 1 defensive midfielder the whole game so we'd have managed as we did.

It's a dick move, shit man managed from the cnut and more of his fantastic youth managing bullshit. Two times he's done that to Januzaj today.

2222~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> probably his best performance of the season.

2223~~~
Shit man management. It was good he never came on but from his perspective, shocking behaviour from Vangle.

2224~~~
looked sharp getting up off the bench a couple of times <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2225~~~
How Memphis managed to play the 90 minutes with him on bench is beyond me

2226~~~
I'm sorry but taking off a holding midfielder for a woefully out of form attacking player when we're a goal up makes no sense.

We've seen stuff like this happen plenty of times when substitutions get altered after a goal or injury; it's just bad luck for Januzaj it happened to him twice in the same game.

2227~~~
So instead we've taken off a holding midfielder for a not-specified-role/CB/RB unexperienced 18 year old.

Tactical masterstroke really.

2228~~~
He was getting instructions when Mata scored and when Carrick got injured probably. He can't really sub Mata after scoring because ya'll would be calling in bullshit and he can't really send him on for Carrick when we're seeing the game out.

2229~~~
Having a go at LVG for doing the right thing on subs at the expense of Januzaj playing tracksuit yo-yo. A player who has been taking the piss himself for most of the season too. This place sometimes.

2230~~~
I rarely pity a player but I felt sorry for him

2231~~~
He's a goner and he knows it.

2232~~~
Felt sorry for him, at least he could have a laugh about it

2233~~~
Man of the match.

2234~~~
LVG did nothing wrong with him today. Januzaj was unlucky sure, but theres no way he should have come on when Carrick went off.

2235~~~
It happens.

2236~~~
You'd rather Januzaj played centre mid instead? This "LVG is an idiot" rhetoric is almost as boring as our football sometimes.

2237~~~
I actually don't know how Memphis plays ahead of him. The kid may lack end product and have issues in his game, but he rarely ever looks shambolic, technically

2238~~~
It was tough luck that he didn't come on but it was sensible for him to stay off given the circumstances.

Still though, if Martial is injured for Tuesday then Januzaj should play for Memphis or Lingard.

2239~~~
He took it well, that's all that matters.

Not like a diva as tabloids hoped but laughed it off with Martial, can't even imagine the reaction if he threw his bib or had a hissyfit.

2240~~~
Don't care if he comes to training while smoking a cigar and goes home to have a threesome with LVg's wife and daughter. There's no way Memphis should be starting ahead of him (or anyone really).

2241~~~
Looks to have bulked up

2242~~~
For me, the issue wasn't that he didn't a chance to come on today. The main problem was/is (and has been this entire season) that he hasn't got chances before Depay, who has absolutely atrocious for us barring a couple of games in Europa. 

He should have started today.

2243~~~
I thought that too. I suppose he hasn't had much else to do.

2244~~~
"Bad behaviour from LVG" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Some of you are an embarrassment to your family. As if it's never happened that managers can change their mind based on the game situation

2245~~~
The cynical view is that LVG is only playing the youngsters that "he" can take credit for. The likes of Wilson, Januzaj and Pereira were all in/around the first team pre-LVG and have barely got a sniff. LVG wants to persist with others like Memphis so that he can take credit for bringing them in and developing them. It is all about his own personal glory and 'legacy'.

2246~~~
I missed the match. What was this commotion about him i heard about not coming on twice?

2247~~~
I might be biased but surely LVG must realized that it's very bad in terms of man management?

2248~~~
At least he laughed the situation off. Still very bad man management from Van Gaal but that pretty much goes hand in hand with LVG now.

2249~~~
Why though? We were looking for a goal and we tried to bring him on. Then we scored and we were looking to shore up the defence with Schneiderlin. And later Carrick got injured and bringing in Adnan would have made us a bit more weaker so we brought on TFM. It's not unheard of at all. In fact it's something I'm sure mourinho would do too.

2250~~~
Tbh managers should go for personal glory and legacy. But, you hope they do it the right way and benefit the team.

Even SAF has been accused of that shit even after he retired and people could be right for all we know.

2251~~~
This. One of the big gripes I have with LvG. I suppose its probably just a bit of human nature as well. Everyone has their so called favorites.

But I hate the fact that some players will get chances, no matter how shit they've performed, for how long. And others are seemingly frozen out, or find it difficult to get opportunities - after 1 poor performance or a mistake etc.

2252~~~
I don't get why LVG chickened out the first time he bringing him on.

Yeah we scored but need not go defensive to hold 1-0 vs Norwich straight away.


I think he did it once before with Januzaj (Or someone else) when he was coming on and we scored. But that time The opposition grabbed a equalizer despite or thanks to LVG's defensive sub instead. Which game was it ? Anyone remember ?

Remember posting about it too.

2253~~~
Hope he gets a chance against west ham. We need some penetration right now

2254~~~
Not a game suited to him tbh. But can't do worse than others.

2255~~~
We don't need another spineless player on the pitch.

2256~~~
Didn't know spineless players could carry a disastrous team under David Moyes

2257~~~
this is exactly a game for anybody but Januzaj, might not do worse than Mata from the right though

2258~~~
based on that two involvements in the game he deserves to start next game, got nothing to lose and you can always save lingard for the fa cup final..

2259~~~
Did he even touch the ball tonight?

2260~~~
Probably our second best player after Martial

2261~~~
He made that pretty sweet turning pass down the line to Lingard, outside of Martial it was probably the best play of the night.

2262~~~
Great ball tbh

2263~~~
Nice pass mate.

2264~~~
Showed quality in the 3 minutes he was on. Seriously, I don't know if I'm a delusional fanboy of him or if my judgement is totally off. Every time I watch him play he oozes world class talent. Why does the management (and some other fans) not see this?

2265~~~
It's a shame that Memphis has been stinking up the pitch all season, Lingard has been painfully mediocre for 13-14 games and this guy can barely get a kick. Say all you want about his lack of end product, but Januzaj usually looks like a PL level footballer at worst and a great talent at  best, unlike what we've seen from Memphis for large chunks of this season.

2266~~~
How much has Memphis played since December though? I don't think he started a lot of games other than EL (where januzaj couldn't play anyways). Januzaj did come on a few times and was out injured for a month. He also hasn't really taken his chances.

2267~~~
Januzaj 1286 minutes over 28 appearances in the last 2 seasons while Memphis has 913 minutes over 19 appearances just from New Year's. Seen as Memphis has seemingly been frozen out in the new year then it is hard to say Januzaj has been given a chance.

2268~~~
What was he going to do in 3 mins? LVG is a fecking clown. 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2269~~~
What fecking chances?

2270~~~
Memphis has played plenty all season despite being horrible.

What chances? You mean the three games at the start of the season where he was actually decent unlike most of Memphis' performances.

The attitude stuff might be genuine but it's a real shame this kid was deemed unnecessary at the start. Not sure what firepower LVG thought we apparently had.

2271~~~
Januzaj could have and probably should have pushed for a starting role last season. Di Maria was useless and had he given more of an effort he could have got into the team ahead of him. Mata for instance was benched for almost 2 months but he worked hard, got a chance took it and started lot of games since. Even young started as a winger ahead of Di Maria and januzaj is a lot more talented than him. LvG for all his buffoonery tactically and gives chances to youngsters if they stake a claim. Mourinho wouldn't play a youngster to save his life. Just a couple of days back, Sam luckhurst tweeted that warren Joyce was complaining about him putting an effort for u21 games. Whatever the reason, that's extremely naive from someone who has got a lot to prove. 

Overall I'm disappointed with him. His overall demeanour seems to be that he feels entitled. Maybe I'm being harsh because I liked him so much that I used to argue with random Liverpool fans on Twitter that he was better than sterling and he has let me down.

2272~~~
Wherever he will play next season, it will be a crucial one for him. He used to be a top talent, now we don't know

2273~~~
And the very next day Adnan was in the first team squad. So is he being rewarded for a bad attitude or is Luckhurst full of shit? I think we all know the answer to that. If you think Joyce yelling at a player means anything then you clearly don't know Joyce.

2274~~~
He might still be better than Sterling...

Not the lad's biggest fan but thought he did well in the few minutes he got. Hope we see him again before the season's end.

2275~~~
Yeah maybe. Luckhurst himself seemed to get this off someone else but still he hasn't done anything to deserve start. Memphis has been shit and shouldn't start either. But the point was that Adnan has to improve a long way if he needs to get into the squad under mourinho, something I want. But it doesn't seem very likely. 

PS- wanted to vent about this for a long time so apologies if I didn't make sense. Emotion over sense I suppose. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2276~~~
Luke Shaw has just been interviewed and stated he believes Januzaj could go on to be one of the best players in the world. I really agree with him, the problem with players like him is when they have limited chances they try too hard to prove themselves and end up trying to do it all on their own. LVG has been good for certain youth players but our two most naturally talented footballers in Januzaj and Pereira really have had no luck under him.

2277~~~
Exactly. Pretty much sums what I feel about Januzaj and Pereira and even Wilson.
You pit a 19 year old against ADM, its pretty obvious Januzaj would try too hard. Even when ADM was poor, Young was preferred.
One can't argue that he lacks talent, Moyes' season proved that at the very least. One can only wonder, if LVG had trusted him the same way he trusted Depay at the beginning of season, how good Januzaj would have become

2278~~~
This 

One can only wonder what Fergie or Poch or Klopp would have done with this bunch of youngsters. An arm around and encouragement does wonders for a young player. 

I can't remember the player interview that said Fergie once told him to forget about the last few matches that didn't go so well but he should step out on the pitch of OT with confidence of the best player in the world. He was a young player at the time 

Any player would work harder if they know their manager cares about them. 

I still have high hopes for the lad.

2279~~~
They are best mates.

2280~~~
You don't say someone could go on to be one of the best players in the world just because you don't want to upset your buddy. He must see him in training and realise what a great talent he is, we've all seen the glimpses of top quality and an on form and confident Januzaj really could go places.

2281~~~
i wouldnt say that about my mate unless i believed it. Januzaj is an unbelievable talent, easily up there with pogba and under fergie would have been amazing here. Lets see if the next manager can get his true potential out of him.

2282~~~
He said: "<b>I truly believe</b> he can become one of the best players in the world if he fullfils his potential."

I believe it too, Luke <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2283~~~
What a boost it would be if he became a top class player. We wouldn't need to spend. Januzaj in an attacking role, Fosu Mensah at CB or CDM, we may have the players in the club.

2284~~~
He should first try to establish himself as a decent player before even thinking about being one of the best.
I wasn't convinced even in the beginning much but he has even disappointed in regards of my low expectations of him.
The least he could do is have a good attitude but 3 different managers have already criticized him and Mourinho is the last manager to compromise in terms of attitude.

2285~~~
If our youngsters fulfill their potential
DDG- RB(or McNair) CB(?) TFM Shaw Gribbin MF(?) Januzaj Pereira Martial Rashford (With Wilson, CBJ in subs) <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Mourinho praised him atleast twice in his debut season. Curious what happens to him under a Mourinho. Not really his type of player otherwise.

2287~~~
Then you woke up.

2288~~~
Ranieri: "For me it’s important to let our fans dream. We will lose, but it’s important".
Let me dream!

2289~~~
I think he's proper talent but hopeless at applying it.  Mourinho will have a go at sorting him out & then get rid probably.  Might not take long, either,
Decent opportunity for JM to assert his authority. 

50/50 on who gets shortest shrift, Adnan or Memphis?

2290~~~
I think neither will last. Depay might last longer, though he shouldn't.

2291~~~
I really think Januzaj could end up being Mourinho's 10.

He's proved that he can work hard, he's quick a good passer and can finish well.

2292~~~
Would love it if that happened

2293~~~
Can't see it unless he stops getting pushed off the ball so easily. At the moment he's still too lightweight and gets pushed around.

2294~~~
Perhaps but he's no weaker than Oscar or Mata, If we can transition quicker and not dilly-dally on the ball so much, players won't get a chance to get that close.  

He just needs to raise his awareness also.

2295~~~
Doubtful if that happens. He is inconsistent and doesn't track back like mourinho likes his 10s to do. Maybe pereira will be as pereira is good defensively.

2296~~~
Come on Adnan, you can do this!

2297~~~
Amazing what a coach can do with a bit of belief and instruction. We will see what happens, but if he can get over his niggling injuries I think he's got a good chance.

2298~~~
Just imagine all playing their best football..

--------------------------MARTIAL---------------------------

DEPAY-------------------RASHFORD------------------JANUZAJ

Yes, I know I shifted a few of them around from what some would call their positions but they have all demonstrated they can play these positions well and I think if you do want to fit them all in then this would be the closest thign you will get to round pegs in round holes.

If they were all playing good football together what a bloody front-line we could have in 2-3 years....

2299~~~
Got some good players for the future

2300~~~
Bye-bye...

2301~~~
?

2302~~~
Juices

2303~~~
Really hope he succeeds here under Jose. He looked like a gem of a player under the Moyes season. Had a great game when put up top as a 9 under LVG, too. Really think he can be world-class someday. Poor decisions, on and off the pitch, are fecking him. If only he could get his head straight, and do what needs to be done.

Do justice to that shirt number, fella.

2304~~~
Didn't really class you as a nsync fan.

2305~~~
Go murder the competition Adnan!

2306~~~
remember memphis posted similar videos and didnt really kicked on since that, I hope Adnan sorts out his attitude and starts to work really hard, particularly on his stamina, he already looks quite well build and even if that would be quite a surprise that Mourinho would like him and gave him a decent role in his squad I say why not, sometimes irrational things completely turn around.. hopefully Mou will push him on along with some other players

2307~~~
I'd sell him for "Preparation Is <b>key</b>" alone.

2308~~~
Him and Pereira should be given a chance next season. Would be brilliant if both became an integral part of the team.

2309~~~
Lack of effort will always be a hindrance but he blatantly has more talent than the likes of Lingard so it's just a question of whether we wait or not. 

Then again, if we're to wait on the likes of Phil Fecking Jones, I cannot see why we shouldn't with Januzaj.

2310~~~
At least he's showing commitment! Really hope it works out for the lad.

2311~~~
I would love him to make it, when he burst onto the scene when Moyes was here it was like the Fergie years would continue. Obviously that hasn't happened but I still have a lot of affection for him as a United player and I think and hope he can realise where everything went wrong for him and can push on and become the player he should be.

2312~~~
I hope he makes it just because his song is one of the best most original songs in years

2313~~~
He's ridiculously talented, I hope he's given a chance.

Him and Pereira I really hope we give chances to this year.

2314~~~
Yep.

Sort their heads out and knuckle down and they will be major talents for us.

2315~~~
When you're rubbish at football it's frustrating to see a guy with loads of talent not do the easy stuff. The stuff we can all do. 

Good to see him in the gym but there's nobody pushing him over, shouting at him or closing him down there. He's got to get on the pitch and show he's grown up a bit.

2316~~~
Glad to see he's working hard off the pitch, hope it works out for him this season.

Hope he doesn't bulk up too much like Memphis, he's not exactly the speediest player as it is.

2317~~~
I don't know why fans are so negative about Adnan when 95% of footballers never even have his potential. Over in the <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/henrikh-mkhitaryan-agent-says-he-wants-to-join-man-utd.418412/">Mkhitaryan thread</a> I raised the demons from hell by suggesting he needed more time, better coaching or the right loan move. It took Mkhitaryan 7 years of trying before he became the top footballer I hope Adnan will one day be.

2318~~~
Considering he's had <b>equal or more impact</b> than Memphis in his <b>United/PL</b> <b>career</b>, I see no reason to discriminate between the two or even prefer the latter more to him. In comparison, Januzaj is a year younger, home grown and more technically sound, however more or less the same in decision making.
We need to determine his position. With dedication and the manager's trust he can at least become a good to great squad player for us.

2319~~~
Hope he can get his chances including Perreira, TFM, etc etc. But will the fans/media expectations on the new manager ruin their chances?

2320~~~
There is no reason to sell him unless we get a really good offer.  And it's nice to see him working on his balance, I remember when he was off form he was constantly falling over.

2321~~~
When was this? He just posted videos a few days ago too.

2322~~~
This coming season is his last chance to make it here. I hope he's given his chance and takes it.

Work hard for Mourinho and he will respect you. He needs to combine his technical ability with hard work and willingness to become a team player, rather than an individual.

2323~~~
Glad he is doing balance drills. He needs it.

2324~~~
Falls into the category of a lot of players here...What's his best position? Also his physicality, he's slim and plays that way unlike say a Oscar or Willan who bring attitude to their game, he doesn't. It's not about doing weights, it's a mentality. Technically brilliant but the Prem like many others before him, isnt for him....

2325~~~
While I disagree with your latter statement, you make a great point about how weaker players succeed. If you have the heart and also intelligence to play, then there is no reason for a player not to succeed in the Prem. Januzaj needs to show consistent  grit and toughness while also avoiding lingering and overdribbling on the ball too much.

2326~~~
Zlatan-Martial-James-Mkhitaryan
This looks like our main attacking side next season.
No place for the likes of januzaj and depay.
Most importantly, his quality fits to those of Aston villa.

2327~~~
I don't see him being sold for the sake of it as many of you seem to want. Managers like to keep to full teams worth of players in their squad : 23 or more.
<ol>
<li>Januzaj qualifies as a home-grown player so isn't taking up one of the precious <i>foreign over 21 player</i> slots, which are limited to a maximum of 17. I can see Rojo, Romero, and one of the foreign midfielders going before him.</li>
<li>He's also one of the best crossers from wing play which could be handy to feed Zlatan.</li>
<li>He's not the best paid, and something will need to be done to balance the books after bringing in so Zlatan / James / Mkhitaryan on such high salaries. The more likely casualties will be Young or Memphis, who both get 2½ to 3 times Adnan's pay.</li>
</ol>

2328~~~
He bulked up quite a lot going into last season and it looks like he's put on a few pounds again, can only help him in a Mourinho team. If everyone in our squad is playing as well as they ever have done for a decent spell in a united shirt (so not, for example basti of two years ago at bayern), absolute peak form, then januzaj wouldn't get in to the starting eleven, but as our players are so rarely at their best, and definitely not at the same time as each other I think he may have a chance this season. He is immensely talented and I have no doubts if he leaves us it will be for a champions league club, hopefully though he'll realise he needs to knuckle down, accept his place on the bench and make the most out of cameos and offer good competition for places. Would not be surprised at all if he is our equivalent of Oscar come the end of the season.

2329~~~
Good to see him in the gym. Although bulking up isn't his main concern right now. He needs to get his head in order for another assault on the starting XI.
