1~~~[4]
Delighted for him. Well done.

2~~~[4]
The enthusiasm of youth <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. This should be a wake up call for some of our experienced players who takes their roles for granted sometimes.

3~~~[4]
This kid looks good.

4~~~[4]
Congrats to him.

5~~~[4]
Good work young fella

6~~~[5]
The next Rooney. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

7~~~[5]
What a night for him, brilliant.

8~~~[5]
What a bloody debut!! 

Absolutely delighted for the lad <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

9~~~[5]
hes like the black RVN

10~~~[5]
Great night for him. If this doesn't bring a smile to your face I don't know what will.

11~~~[4]
Delighted for him.

12~~~[4]
Delighted for him. He's top scorer in the premiership for me on my FM save <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

13~~~[3]
Van Gaal deserves credit for this. Always loved how he's given chances to so many youth players.

14~~~[4]
Even putting the goals aside, his movement off the ball looks very good.

15~~~[4]
Sell Rooney, give Rashford and Van Gaal who uncovered him new contracts!

16~~~[4]
Rasher <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Chuffed for the lad

17~~~[5]
Chuffed to bits for him. Now will get the chance vs Arsenal.

18~~~[4]
Midjtylland need to call a doctor....

There is a rash all over them

19~~~[4]
How about that for a debut. I'm more impressed with how he bursts past players though, nice showing of pace.

20~~~[4]
He da man.

21~~~[5]
Still chance for a hattrick tonight. Fingers crossed!

22~~~[2]
That'll be coached out of him as he trains more with the first team.

23~~~[4]
Who the hell is this kid, and why are you in the last 16 now?

24~~~[1]
When is his next injury?

25~~~[3]
Great debut for him. I wonder if you'll start him on Sunday if Martial is out.

26~~~[3]
i was literally about to say the same thing....BTW, GET IN MEMPHIS!!!

27~~~[4]
what a start. looks like an upgrade on Wilson, and younger too.

28~~~[5]
I'm not one for hyperbole but he might be the greatest footballer who ever lived.

29~~~[4]
Nice work lad, hopefully he'll kick on and be given a chance given  our injury list

30~~~[5]
Absolutely brilliant debut! Given the injuries to Rooney, Martial and Keane I think we'll be seeing more of him soon.

31~~~[5]
I've been feeling fairly indifferent during most of the matches this season (personal reasons and because we've been fecking boring to watch), but his first goal fired me up for this game. This is what football is about. Fantastic stuff.

32~~~[4]
I'm the first to lambast those who decry Mourinho's disuse of youth, but, damn, I don't think I cheer harder when an academy player scores.

33~~~[5]
Did very well, a dream debut!

34~~~[3]
Tenner says at least three tabloid papers mention Macheda in their match reports tomorrow.

35~~~[3]
Decent debut. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

36~~~[4]
He's a natural

37~~~[4]
Absolutely buzzing for him.

38~~~[4]
Get in there!

Cool head on his shoulders, that's for sure.

39~~~[4]
Too bad he didn't take the second penalty. Could've been a hat-trick on his debut.

40~~~[5]
who's his agent? better tie him up on long term contract. This guy is the real deal. Rashford and Wilson would compliment each other, I think. I have a dream...

41~~~[5]
It's important not to get carried away. But he is easily the best young player in the world right now.

42~~~[3]
Presumably his contract already runs through to June which, with Maureen supposedly on the way, seems about long enough.

43~~~[4]
Who'd have thought an injury to Martial could be in any way positive.

44~~~[3]
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

45~~~[4]
Well done lad!

46~~~[4]
Interesting performance. I thought at times he drifted wide unnecessarily, giving us no option in the middle. Of course, he was in the right place to finish both chances. Liked the way he stole possession a couple of times. Also showed good pace at times and some creativity with his back-heels. Dream debut really.

47~~~[3]
He used to play Varane, didn't he?

48~~~[3]
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

49~~~[4]
Two nice finishes. Great to see.

50~~~[3]
Rashford, Wilson, Martial and Depay, at least one of them should turn out ok for us long term... please...

51~~~[3]
200% agreed.

52~~~[3]
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

53~~~[4]
He definitely was tonight. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Was great even before the goals. Excellent debut.

54~~~[4]
What a debut. His all round play was good as well. I hope the notion that the system stifles centre forwards dies with that performance.

55~~~[4]
<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>as you like. Him & Martial...the future.

56~~~[3]
Spot on.

57~~~[3]
So all we need to do is convince Maureen that agreeing to his 10m euro signing was part of the small print of his contract.

58~~~[5]
What a debut! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Two classic center forward goals and he showed good movement off the ball all game, constantly getting in good positions in the box, plus he looks decent on the ball as well. amazing to think he wasn't MOTM.

59~~~[4]
Gonna give mertasaker nightmares for weeks this kid

60~~~[3]
Indeed, the way he lost the CB for his missed header (wish he'd scored) was excellent. Reminded me of Chicharito

61~~~[4]
Delighted for him.

If we can get Depay playing like he did today and Januzaj playing like he did under moyes we would have quite a formidabke AND YOUNG front 4

62~~~[4]
He's like a young Martial

63~~~[3]
Even Messi didn't score two goals on debut.

64~~~[3]
Van Gaal taking credit again <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

65~~~[3]
Is this kid rated highly? Whats his chances of making it properly here?

66~~~[3]
Is this kid rated highly? Whats his chances of making it properly here?

67~~~[4]
If anything you're playing it down.

68~~~[2]
THATS how it's done Wayne

69~~~[3]
I was going to say the greatest human but I didn't want him getting big headed.

70~~~[4]
The only one that moved when Mata kept the ball alive. Movement of a true striker / poacher that wants goals. Was happy with that.

71~~~[3]
Wilson scored 2 against Hull in his debut.

72~~~[4]
I like his acceleration when closing players down. He won the ball back several times, could come in handy if he plays against Arsenal.

73~~~[3]
This.  

After martial absence, the easier move was to place Depay at no9 and replace him with Perreier.  But LVG stuck to his principles and it was a brilliant decision

74~~~[2]
No..

75~~~[3]
at this rate, it'll only be another 122 games until he catches up to Rooney. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

76~~~[4]
Was in the right place for a centre forward hence his 2 goals.  At his age, that shows great instinct.  Likewise though both goals were easy finishes, fact remains he was a bully boy with his confident smashes.  Also looked strong when shoulder to shoulder and can also run with the ball with pace.

If Martial is injured for Arsenal, he starts!!!! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  Ironic if he does and Welbeck does not for Arsenal

77~~~[4]
Fairly highly, my take is he's a player that we may have to wait to fully develop physically, he's got the frame to be an absolute monster.

78~~~[2]
Wilson's the better striker.

People were gushing over Wilson after the Hull game as well.. Too soon to build up Rahsford or write off Wilson. Wilson will turn out the better striker imo

79~~~[4]
Marcus Smashford more like... AmIright! OI OI!

80~~~[4]
Hero.

81~~~[4]
Very happy for him. Would love to see him start vs Arsenal

82~~~[4]
So, so happy for him. Great.

83~~~[5]
Unbelievable night for him.

84~~~[2]
I'd say it's 50-50 tbh though depends also on the definition of making it here. Tough to tell fully as he is developing quicker now but still overall hasn't been that great this season.

85~~~[4]
Made my day/week/month/year/decade/life

86~~~[5]
Stuff of dreams. fecking delighted for him.

Brace on his debut. Unbelievable <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

87~~~[5]
Delighted for him! Absolutely amazing debut. Scored two goals and skinned their defenders a few times. Very good technique and pace. I want to see him play on Sunday.

88~~~[3]
He played Santon and Balotelli at Inter

89~~~[3]
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Its funny because your normally such a miserable bastard.

90~~~[4]
Yeah, his movement was definitely very good. Found space well, sometimes ghosting in. Relatively easy finishes, though, but we've all seen vets sky those opportunities over the bar so much credit to him. Hope he gets time and doesn't let the ego get too big. Great debut, but then Macheda seemed to be the next Ole but didn't kick on.

91~~~[4]
His goals tonight were the most excited I've been all season. Delighted for him. Wonder if he'll get the start Sunday?

92~~~[3]
Depends on Martial's fitness i suppose.

If he's fit then Rashford would go back to the bench and if he isn't he starts. Don't think there's another option ?

93~~~[3]
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

94~~~[3]
Wilson was the last and the only one to do the same.

95~~~[4]
Not seen much of him before, but I know of his reputation. Actually looked quite Martial-like tonight in that he is quick, strong, direct and kind of 'no frills'. Hope he can keep it up!

96~~~[4]
Well done to him, got his chance and took it without looking out of place.

97~~~[4]
Obviously he's got a long way to go but I think while Kiko was a predator, Rash has much more to his game. So high hopes for him.

98~~~[4]
Pace, movement, and a poachers nose, all incredibly impressive. 

It was his mentality that really stood out, played with no fear, like he'd been playing in the first team with years, and went for everything he had a half chance of reaching.

99~~~[4]
Fair play to him. We needed a light to be shined in our hour of need and he delivered.

100~~~[4]
Wow what a debut that was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. Hopefully Martial will be fit for Sunday but if this guy does play he could give Mertesacker a few problems. I hope this won't be the last we see of him and that he also doesn't dine out on this (see Macheda vs Villa).

101~~~[2]
At least you've got your head screwed on Nev<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

We have to be realistic and understand that he's good but he won't be winning world player of the year for at least... 2 or 3 years yet.

102~~~[3]
We all make mistakes.

103~~~[4]
Absolutely delighted for him. as a young player, you need that bit of luck that will get your name noted down. Took his chance superbly well and felt so good; with all the negativity floating round the club, to see an 18 year old kid celebrating with his mates/family after scoring on his debut. That's what footballs about. Good luck to ya Marcus!

104~~~[4]
Lived every United fans dream right there.

105~~~[4]
He played well. he will need to grow physically but hopefully he is a player we can rely on in the future.

106~~~[4]
He's manc right? looks like Lingards taller brother and mix of Wilson and Martial, was cheering to his goals like mad! Fecking brilliant debut,  give him 15 years contract

107~~~[3]
With Keane, Wilson and this kid we've some good talent. Some nice movement from him and kept his head when the chances came. Delighted for him. When we play at a tempo, like we did tonight then it makes it easier for these youngsters to do good things.

108~~~[4]
Read this as "hopefully he be given a chance to get on our injury list."

Glad I read it again - let's hope he isn't also cursed.

109~~~[3]
And Will Keane

110~~~[5]
Movement was amazing.

For both goals he deliberately ran away from the obvious direction of play so when the assist passer looked up to cross, he was unmarked and in space.  That's very smart and instinctive thinking.  

Andrew Cole was saying that was his key skill and why he was able to be in position for so many of the chances he had during his United career.

111~~~[4]
That's a sweet stat.

112~~~[4]
Doesn't even have a wikipedia page but...

114~~~[4]
Delighted for Rashford.
Rashford, Keane and Wilson... I'm glad to see that we have young strikers that can cover Rooney/Martial.

115~~~[5]
18 years old...are you kidding me?

116~~~[5]
Brilliant overall performance and two lovely goals. Great start to his career hopefully we will see more of him.

117~~~[4]
I didn't get to see the match but only the goals. 

Could anyone shed some light on how he was for the rest of the match? Was he just playing well or was it class whenever he was on the ball?

118~~~[3]
And this one? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Marcus Rashford (18 years and 117 days) overtakes George Best as Manchester United's youngest goalscorer in ALL European competitions.

119~~~[3]
Welbeck's brother is actually his agent as far as I know

120~~~[3]
Between Wilson and Rashford, who is more likely to make it?

U saw wilson play before and thought he had everything.

121~~~[3]
He was very good. Constantly pressed their defenders forcing them to make mistakes, showed very good technical skills, pace and quick thinking. His positioning was top notch as well. 

He could become a nightmare to play against.

122~~~[3]
He's one of the highest if not the highest paid u18 player we've had so yeah he's always been rated highly. Was always extremely small but has grown about 8/9 inches in the the past 2 years

123~~~[4]
Probably my favourite player ever.

124~~~[4]
He is the black Martial.

125~~~[3]
Jumping in here, I'd say Wilson, at least as a CF.

But Rashford's a tricky one to call since two seasons ago he suddenly shot up in height, and all of a sudden was converted from a tiny, lightning-fast flair winger into a sort of elusive, fast, all-rounder-ish striker. It's hard to know exactly what to make of him nowadays. He's had spells since then when he's been scoring a goal a game, but he's had spells where he couldn't buy a goal too. Wilson's always been exactly what he is, a very fast, very clinical striker who likes to run onto the ball and can score any type of goal you fancy.

126~~~[4]
Pleased for him. Absolutely love it when an academy player scores. Wanted him to take the penalty for the hat-trick but Herrera does seem our best option there at the moment. Great debut in any case. Hope he can continue to improve and be a regular.

127~~~[4]
Looked a complete striker. Direct in his runs and overall had a good game. Really excited. Hope he gets some run now that Keane is out

128~~~[0]

129~~~[4]
He was very good.
Wilson scored 2 on his debut too. I hope some of these kids realize their potential and become a part of the first team squad. That'd be great

130~~~[4]
Looks like he has the potential for a very powerful upper body as he gets stronger. We need more strong and powerful players with physical presence.

131~~~[3]
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

132~~~[4]
Didnt see the game but delighted for the chap.  When you think about the players that have done this on their debut he is on a very esteemed list.

133~~~[4]
Very pleased for the lad. What impressed me the most was that he didn't stop trying to play his natural game even when things weren't going for him. It is obvious that he still has a lot of learning and bulking up to do. The most important thing is that he seems to have the basic tools: pace, technique, and an ability to find space. The next two years will be crucial for him. I hope he stays clear of injuries given his meteoric physical development in the past two years.

The club has some really promising youngsters at the moment: Tyler Reid, RoShaun, Mensah, Axel etc. I just wish we somehow manage to find them competitive game time for their development

134~~~[4]
Reminiscent of a certain someone's debut a couple seasons ago. Both goals are even strikingly similar.

135~~~[3]
I dont know if this kid is gonna make it here or not, but it feels great to see an academy product have a game like he did.

Looked the part last night, very good movement, pace and power.

136~~~[3]
Can we come up with a chant for "Rasher" that involves bacon?

137~~~[3]
Some of the youth that have come on this season have really looked more composed than our first starters. Rashford, C B Jo, Riley, Varela. This is quite good to see.

138~~~[4]
Got into good positions in the box and had some clever touches outside of it. 

Hopefully we start getting loans right, unlike with Januzaj, and we figure out which of Keane, Rashford and Wilson should be here and which can get big minutes at decent clubs.

139~~~[4]
I always had high hopes for him. Thought he had the potential from seeing footage of him a few years ago. Absolute chuffed for the lad <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>.
His development has stalled a bit this season, Let's hope he gets more game time. I really think he has what it takes to make it at PL level.

140~~~[3]
The black， white Pele

141~~~[3]
Has he played a senior game before? I can't be bothered to check and see if he's had a loan spell

142~~~[4]
Absolutely nothing better than seeing an academy kid shine. Chuffed for the lad.

143~~~[4]
The new Wilson!

144~~~[4]
Nope. Been mostly with U18s. Think he was injured too, didn't play much this season. But was brilliant last season.

145~~~[0]

146~~~[4]
I just caught the highlights of the game. I know Giggs rates Rashford, but after he scored his second goal, Albert and van Gaal sort of congratulate Giggs in a way. Was nice to see.

147~~~[4]
I'm still buzzing after watching that performance last night. Can't even begin to imagine what that must feel like for him.

148~~~[3]
He needed 30 mins to get into the game but after that he really got going and grew in confidence. Always great to see young players do well!

149~~~[4]
Great change in pace.  He is rapid!  Cannot believe he's only 18!  He's built like a tank

150~~~[3]
Is it too soon to pit him against Arsenal? I'd love to see him have a run at Mertesacker.

151~~~[3]
Yeah I noticed that. Van Gaal was gently punching Giggs on the arm as if to say "Good call"

152~~~[2]
Depending on extent of his injury, possibly played his last game for us. Be surprised if he makes it to next season.

153~~~[3]
Thinking the same.

He's just had too many injuries.

154~~~[0]

155~~~[3]
Yeah BT showed Butt in the stands after Rashford's goal. Looked chuffed to bits.

156~~~[3]
Maybe there is something in Butts recent promotion

157~~~[4]
That's good news I think. If he's grown much taller recently and already his body coordination and control has adapted to his long legs, it generally means it will get better after he has stopped growing. And it already looked pretty good.

158~~~[4]
With no other option it surely isn't too soon. I wouldn't rush Martial personally as more likely will pull his hamstring for real if played too soon. I say throw him in as he will definitely give the German bean pole a tough time.

159~~~[4]
Imagine he scored the winner against Arsenal.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I'd throw him in there, personally. We're in a position where we don't have too much to lose (CL looks unlikely), and I'd be happy to see us put in someone who's quite clearly hungry, and has a lot of potential.

160~~~[4]
Obviously still a lot to work on with ball retention, but he had a lovely backheel in the first half on the edge of the box and is very very quick. Looks like he still has room to fill out a little in the coming years, so the future looks pretty bright for him.
He didn't seem overawed by the occasion, so if there is any doubt with Martial for Sunday then I'd say start Rashford.

161~~~[3]
For me we have to get Martial back in there if he's fit, which it sounds like he should be. Rashford did a great job, with his overall performance as well as the goals, and hopefully he'll get more game time this season if we can stay in the two cup competitions. But there were noticeable holes in our game play because he's so lightly-built. We put in the best set of crosses I've seen from us in a single game this season, but there was almost no threat to most of them. And the handful of longer balls forward tried by the likes of Blind and Schneiderlin were less successful than usual because Rashford isn't big enough yet to hope to be able to take them down and hold off a defender the way Martial does.

We're so light on senior players we can't afford to leave out anyone who is fit. If Martial can come back in and Memphis maintain some of that form, then we might have an attacking unit to make up for what will inevitably be a very shaky defence.

162~~~[3]
Yep, agreed. This game should serve as a massive encouragement for him to work as hard as he can, but with his age there is obviously a lot of improvement that needs to happen before he gets regular playing time.

He should get a few more games/minues once 4th is impossible, and we need to rest someone.

163~~~[3]
I think we will be okay at the back judging by what I have heard on the recent injuries. Smalling should hopefully play, and that alone will make a huge difference. I don't think CBJ is too serious either, and Rojo is also back and looked good last night.

I think a couple who were carrying something were rested last night with Arsenal in mind.

164~~~[4]
After watching him star in reserve games on MUTV I have to say it was refreshing and fecking surprising to him in the line-up last night, fair play to the lad and long may it continue, superb debut.

Bring on the kids Louis.

165~~~[3]
There was a moment in the second half out by the touchline where he lost a defender with a lovely sway of the hips before breezing past him to cross.

Probably my most enjoyable part of his performance.

166~~~[3]
HopE he plays against arsenal and he plays better than Welbeck at least.

167~~~[2]
Do we risk playing Martial or take a chance with Rashford up front vs Arsenal?

168~~~[3]
Because memphis suddenly remembered he's a footballer <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

169~~~[3]
He has to play i reckon.

170~~~[4]
We should play him. He's a bit of a wild card but we've got no options. We move Depay, and maybe it effects his game. Marcus is still raw but that can play in our favor if he scores. With the injuries we have, it's not worth risking Martial. Having seen what happened to Keane, we have to ask for the same again I think.

171~~~[2]
Would you risk Martial if he has a slight strain?

172~~~[4]
I'd go with Rashford, hope for a draw vs Arsenal and have Martial fit for the rest of the season. Unless one of the top 4 have a huge slump, that 4th position is already too far for us. The EL and FA Cup have to be our focus now

173~~~[3]
Ah ok, might not be too bad then, cheers.

174~~~[3]
Lets put Martial on the bench, Rashford deserves start even though he will find it tough against physical palyers like koscielny and mertesacker.. Memphis vs bellerin will be interesting as well but we play home so we will have the edge

175~~~[3]
great debut for the lad... but one can't help but wonder how envious/sad keane was to see it.

176~~~[4]
Its great for the kid, but the English press unsuprisingly have gone overboard with their praise yet again.

Its not the praise necessarily that annoys me, but true to form, they are only building him up to tear him down if he struggles later on. They did the same with Memphis at the time too.

If Martial is fit, i'd give him a bench role then bring him on if necessary.

177~~~[4]
He's had a couple of knocks but has already played 30 games across various levels this season. I don't get why you'd say his development had stalled this season either. His development in the past year has been excellent and he's starting to look more like an actual striker rather than just someone played there because the team was lacking strikers

178~~~[3]
Definitely hope to see him play against the Arse.

179~~~[4]
Martial and Rashford will be killer!

180~~~[4]
Two good goals but hardly anywhere near impressive on the ball as Martial, and they're only a couple years apart.

181~~~[4]
Some people will never be satisfied. I wonder how it was on christmas when you grew up <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

183~~~[3]
Tricky little player. good control. impressed.

If he keeps developing, should be a very important player for us.

184~~~[5]
Brilliant that the lad in the black coat celebrating with him just looks like another fan bit was actually on the bench for United's senior team on Monday

185~~~[4]
Yes, last season he was absolutely fantastic but I actually hoped he would start playing a lot more games at the U21 levels this season, which if I recall correctly hasn't been the case.
Whether, that is attributed to other players being there ahead of him or him not getting to that level development wise, I don't know, but I was genuinely hoping he would get more game time at that level. That's why i felt his development might have stalled a bit.

But I agree, he's improved greatly in some respects. If I recall correctly, last season, his finishing wasn't so great. He would often get himself to great positions, but then fluff his lines. He's improved on that I would say, based on the way he's taken those two goals and what I read about him in the United website.

186~~~[0]
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Oh shit, I didn't realize Dean Henderson was there.

187~~~[4]
Our youngest player to ever score in Europe, feckin hell

Martial needs to play if fit, but I would hate to leave him out after that kind of performance.  Does he play anywhere besides striker?

188~~~[3]
May be wrong (on his position) but he played as a winger earlier on at youth level but converting him as a striker has matured his overall play and he hasn't looked back since.

189~~~[5]
This man deserves a raise.

190~~~[4]
Kids need just a chance. Had it not been for a fortuitous moment for Paul Scholes, SAF would have never played him. He thought he was just too small for the premiership level. I have a suspicion SAF did not rate Pogba very high.

191~~~[3]
Martial is a special young player. If you're going to use him as a barometer every academy product will be a disappointment.

192~~~[2]
Yes Martial is THE most talented youngster in Europe. Coman may look impressive but to be as impressive as Martial in a floundering team which is under huge media scrutiny and undergoing significant change is an incredible feat. The pressure on the land is immense. Leading the line for one of the world's truly great clubs having just moved into the country for a record breaking fee as well. It truly is astounding.

193~~~[4]
Yeah I think he's been the most impressive in his age group this season. That he's shone big time is such a dysfunctional team, and in a variety of roles as well (LW, ST) puts him ahead of the rest for me. Granted, I've not seen some of the talented kids in the smaller leagues (Neves, Embolo etc.).

194~~~[3]
One thing that bodes well for Rashford (if true based on the 1 game I've seen), is that he looks more physically ready for this level than Wilson has looked in his appearances for the first team. The thing that really stood out about Wilson was just how simply physically underdevelopment (whether actually physically or in terms of rugidness, using his body etc) he seemed to be for the highest level. So hopefully Rashford is further in that curve at this point. Not writing Wilson off, mind you. This aspect is something that naturally does sort itself out over time and experience.

195~~~[3]
There's not many players around who are as good in the ball as Martial, expecting that from someone just because he's a similar age is ridiculous. Not to mention that 'just a couple of years' is actually a long time in youth development.

196~~~[3]
Even if Embolo has scored a ton of goals in his league, which he hasn't, he wouldn't come near Martial. The premier league is the at the very top with La Liga with regards to competition and league strength.

198~~~[4]
Play Rashford up top, Martial and Memphis supporting and Mata behind.

199~~~[4]
Definitely didn't overreact on Christmas! I just see nothing special in this kid. I would be very happy to eat my words though

200~~~[4]
The best thing about Rashford is that he plays like an orthodox centre forward. His movement and channel runs are atypical of what you'd expect and he did everything very good/decently against a poor side.

Martial is amazing but too often he has over complicated situations; he's go for a dribble instead of laying it off and waiting for the return in a more dangerous position (to be able to shoot/get into the box etc). Sometimes you need that magic to beat a player (or 2 to 3 in Martial's case) but sometimes it's easier and more effective to beat the player OFF the dribble/on the return pass/on a defender's shoulder. 

Rashford played a mature game and hopefully we'll see more of it!

201~~~[5]
One of Rashford's best attributes is his dribbling.

202~~~[4]
I certainly didn't mean that he'll score 2 goals on his debut when I said that but thanks a lot.

203~~~[2]
You don't impress easy do you?

204~~~[4]
You've made your judgement on a single game, that's a joke!

205~~~[3]
Really promising debut but we've seen this before and we've also seen players get hyped up to become nothing.

It's a cliche, but this is when the hard work really starts and most simply aren't up to it. Think it's too soon for a start against Arsenal, i'd imagine Martial will be ok and we'll have Marcus on the bench. But if Martial isn't ok then I guess we'll have to start him, a massive test for the lad.

206~~~[4]
If he starts, he'll be all right. His confidence will be sky-high. Players like him play without fear and, despite his age and inexperience, they dream of playing against teams like Arsenal.

207~~~[3]
Who are you talking about?

208~~~[0]
Dean Henderson

209~~~[0]
<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

210~~~[0]
You too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

211~~~[3]
What! I have no idea if he will be a good player or a bad player, where did I mention or even infer that! I saw what most people saw, a positive first display in which he scored two goals, but until he does that consistently over more games I can't tell you how good his potential is. I just can't fathom how you can judge a player on a single outing

212~~~[4]
Chuffed for the lad. It's Roy of the Rovers stuff and irrespective of what happens, he's had his moment. Goes to show there is young talent in the club once given the chance. Fortunately I've watched these young players grow and whether by LVG default or design, we've seen young players given their chance this season.

213~~~[3]
For those that have seen more of him in the youth teams, how talented is he? What sort of player is he or who can he be compared to in style? Also, how is Demetri Mitchell doing?

214~~~[3]
Plays today. Hope he gives Mertesacker a Rash he can't itch! 

I didn't really know much about him prior to Thursday. I had heard of him from looking through the reserve forum. Is he seen as a highly prodigious talent?

215~~~[5]
Take a bow son!

216~~~[4]
So happy for him.

217~~~[4]
Does he remind anyone else of Pele?

No pressure of course.

218~~~[5]
Stuff of legends from this kid!

<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

220~~~[5]
The new Martial.

221~~~[3]
Sell Rooney asap, feck Ibra and big names, let kid play!! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

222~~~[3]
NOT A CHANCE. HOW? WHY?

223~~~[4]
I was just going to post Martial 2.0

224~~~[3]
This kid. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Amazing.

225~~~[4]
Holy crap!

GOAT!

229~~~[3]
Gwan lad! Bloody get your third today!

230~~~[5]
THERE'S A RASH THERE'S A RASH!

231~~~[3]
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This is wonderful.

232~~~[3]
feck me!!!!!

233~~~[4]
unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lets hope its not another Macheda though

234~~~[4]
Where the hell did this come from? He's good man!

235~~~[5]
Scratch that, he's the new Jesus.

236~~~[2]
It seems like he's not even trying <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Talk about right place, right time.

237~~~[3]
Holy shit hahahah

238~~~[3]
He may well disappear into obscurity after this season just like Macheda but good grief what an impact.

He certainly won't be forgotten after this start.

239~~~[4]
All things considered, he must be worth about £70m right now!

240~~~[4]
Well I think we've sorted our striker problem.

241~~~[5]
Martial 2.0?

Forget that...Pele 2.0

242~~~[3]
Could he become our version of Harry Kane?

As in become a regular consistant scorer

243~~~[4]
A front three of Rashford,Martial and Depay.

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

244~~~[4]
He reminds me of a young Nicolas Anelka.

245~~~[4]
When do we start calling him Smashford?

246~~~[4]
Was he rated well in the youth teams?

247~~~[4]
Pretty well, as a 10, if I'm remembering correctly...

248~~~[5]
I think he's the highest paid u18 we've ever had someone said

249~~~[3]
Not bad

250~~~[4]
Jesus, this guy is an ice cool finisher. Something we've lacked.

251~~~[4]
He's better than Kane was at this age, wouldn't you agree <a class="username" data-user="24632, @GlastonSpur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/24632/">@GlastonSpur</a>? <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/> <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

252~~~[4]
Alright, seems the kid doesn't just come out of nowhere. Very interesting player, United might have struck gold with him.

253~~~[3]
Leave him alone, Spurs are one down to Swanswa at home.

254~~~[4]
Higher than Rooney?

255~~~[3]
Rooney never played in our u18

256~~~[3]
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that would be crazy, think thats just for academy kids.

257~~~[3]
Ah I'm with ya now.

258~~~[3]
Excellent, as much misery as possible should be piled on him.

259~~~[4]
---------Rasfhord-------
Depay---Martial-----Januzaj---

Strong front four of jews!

260~~~[3]
atletico style 442, with martial and roshford upfront?

261~~~[4]
Get the hatto lad. Come on!

262~~~[3]
Well since Glaston only goes by goals to game ratios, Rashford is the best player that's ever played in his eyes.

263~~~[4]
4 goals in 5 shots and 135 minutes.

264~~~[3]
Exsqueeze me?

265~~~[4]
We given him a contract for life yet?

266~~~[4]
He's genuinely looking like a quality player even if you ignore the goals <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
Brilliant for him though, just imagine the confidence flowing through him.

267~~~[4]
Good player, has great natural instincts but still plenty of work ahead of him.

268~~~[3]
Yeah, two big strong skilful Fletcher Moss Rangers taking advantage of the comedy Arsenal style defending from both sides. Fortunately Arsenal are even more Arsenaly than we are <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

269~~~[0]
...typo?

270~~~[4]
Happy for him. Come in when the team's putting some chances on a plate for the forward and he's taken them well. Too early to say much else.

271~~~[4]
The lad needed just 30 min to score 2 league goals. Rooney needed 1300 min to score the same amount of league goals in the first half of the season. But Rooney fanboys blamed the system <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

272~~~[3]
Nah. It's how Van Gaal says "youth".

273~~~[4]
I really like this idea actually, say what you want about LvG but he's left us with some gems.

274~~~[3]
He's gonna hold Rooney out of the team until he leaves for China in the summer <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

275~~~[0]
Feck me...<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

276~~~[3]
LvG: "The juice/Jews academy"

277~~~[4]
4 goals in 5 shots and 135 minutes.

278~~~[5]
Deadly.

279~~~[5]
oh, feel the Rash baby!

280~~~[4]
Unbelievable first week for him. Hope he gets a hattrick.

281~~~[5]
Hopefully this lad gets his hattrick. Very impressed.

282~~~[4]
Probably got away with a handball/red card. But oh well...what a player! Great movement for both goals (again)

283~~~[4]
Everything happens for a reason. So happy for him. Looks to have a great future ahead of him.

284~~~[0]
OptaJoe?

285~~~[4]
Dream start for the lad.  Hate when young players get unreal expectations because of good debuts. Hopefully he continues to get more minutes to develop and prove himself

286~~~[4]
Just watched the replay. Clearly hits his arm that is in natural position, but it looked a bit like he pushed the ball forwards.

287~~~[4]
BBC Sport says he has 4 goals with his first 5 shots as a professional! Already scored as many United goals as Radamel Falcao! The hype is going to be something extraordinary.

288~~~[4]
Bit of a weird time to bring it up. We've clearly been playing more offensively as a team for a couple of months now. Rooney scored 7 goals and got 3 assists in 9 games in 2016. That's partly because he wasn't playing like a donkey any more but also partly because we started to play more open football.

289~~~[4]
Yes I think it's the shoulder move to, rather than away, that makes it debatable. I'm sure Wenger/Arsenal fans will rage about it if they drop points

290~~~[3]
Is he the real deal? 

I mean will he now be our starting xi for now on?

291~~~[3]
Yeah, LvG loves juice and if he's playing well there's no way he'll take him out of the first team.

292~~~[3]
Started as a winger. Converted into a striker. Ironically, his biggest problem at the U18 levels was his finishing. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. 
Feck, has he improved on that.

293~~~[2]
You are having a laugh.

294~~~[3]
Gutted if it's a hamstring<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

295~~~[3]
*phew*

296~~~[2]
Didn't he just get kicked in the balls?

297~~~[2]
Yup.

298~~~[3]
Yeah. Was just weird the way he went down. Would expect something more WWE style.

299~~~[0]
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

300~~~[4]
An assist as well now. Good awareness too. Looks like he's going to take on his men, but sees Herrera's run and slots it to him at the perfect moment. What a performance!

301~~~[4]
He's the real deal. Awareness, decision making, movement, pace.

302~~~[3]
Assist. 

Good hold up play.

303~~~[4]
United have an enviably young front three.

304~~~[4]
Great awareness and composure to get the assist, most youngsters (and plenty of experienced players) would have smashed a pointless shot into the defender.

305~~~[4]
He's dangerous. What a difference it makes (much like Martial) having a striker like Rashford who has pace, strength as well as good drive to make it count.

And Yes, I'm referencing Rooney.

306~~~[3]
Rashford>Messi imo

307~~~[4]
4 goals and an assist in two games.

308~~~[3]
Sign Mahrez and you got yourself a potentially dangerous and fast front three in Martial, Rashford and Mahrez

309~~~[3]
And to think we've still got to put up with Rooney as first choice until he breaks Sir Bobby's record.

310~~~[4]
I'd be very annoyed if Rooney gets into the team ahead of Rashford again, providing Rashford continues to perform.

311~~~[2]
Looks shattered. Can't blame him.

312~~~[4]
Another brilliant performance from the lad.

313~~~[4]
Brilliant today, looks like complete CF in the making.

314~~~[4]
His giggling in the interview <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

315~~~[3]
No, it isn't weird at all. A barely known youngster form the academy exposed the incredibe shitness of Rooney in the first half of the season. Rashford did more in one game than Rooney did for the entire first half of the season! Even if are playing a bit differently now (didn't LVG deny it though?; besides, we didn't attack that much in this game!) Rooney was ineffably shit in the first half of the season and ruined our league campaign.

316~~~[4]
Anyone see him in the post match interview with Shreeves? Giggling like a kid - he is a kid! - throughout the interview, seems like a down to earth guy. So, so chuffed for him!

317~~~[3]
The commentators just said Nicky Butt has been showing him old school RvN videos this week.

318~~~[4]
What a player. What I like about him is that all four goals have seen him be in the right place at the right time... You cant teach that.

319~~~[4]
What a great looking kid, just saw his post match interview, giggling and completely oblivious to what he's become.   Just wonderful.  So good to see the local lad comet through.  I have a feeling his life has changed forever.

320~~~[2]
Wayne who?

321~~~[3]
Rashford for the ballon door '16

322~~~[4]
Class performance, his movement is superb, his finishing is composed and his hold up play is good, the assist for Herrera's goal was superb and he almost got another when he laid it on for Memphis.

323~~~[4]
Seems very accomplished already, makes very good decisions on the ball and he's very relaxed. So happy right now.

324~~~[4]
He is the ideal Van Gaal striker since he is scoring about 80% of his chances.

325~~~[4]
Good thing your not connected to United in any position.

326~~~[4]
Really really confident youngster. Cannot believe how well he's taken his chance.

327~~~[4]
Can't wait to see him and Martial like up

328~~~[5]
Wow, just wow! For 18 years old, he plays with so much experience. Seems to be an all rounder, in terms of play style. He's strong, good in the air, good dribbler, links up play and scores goals. I must say, what I like about him the most is his ability to be in the right place at the right time. All of his goals have come inside the box. He seems to be a natural poacher - similar to Hernandez, which is what we've missed this season. As good as Martial has been, even he doesn't seem to have this natural instinct within the box. 

His story so far reminds me of Harry Kanes, in the way that he got in the team due to injuries and took his chance straight away. Since then, he hasn't looked back. Hoping that can be the same for Marcus Rashford.

329~~~[3]
Same, but that would involve dropping Memphis or sticking Martial/Memphis on the right which wouldn't be ideal.

330~~~[5]
This guy is just insane. Two games and two MOTMs. Keep having to remind myself that he's just 18. Was isolated for long periods but did ever so well. Excellent hold up play, strong in the air, two goals and one assist. DAMN. Something tells me this isn't another Macheda situation. He's proper quality

331~~~[5]
I gave him a 10 today.  Anything less would have been a travesty.

332~~~[5]
Same, 2 goals and an assist on his league debut. Brilliant.

333~~~[3]
Already scored as many as Falcao did for us.

334~~~[5]
Amazing

335~~~[3]
True <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

336~~~[3]
Great knack of being in the right place at the right time. Time will tell whether he will go on to big things in the long term or fade away, but a fantastic story in the here and now.

337~~~[3]
Could have sworn one of the commentators mentioned that Rashford was a winger/played a lot on the wings.  There may be a way to get all three on the pitch at the same time in a system where Rashford's given license to play as a wide-forward.  Or, hell, we could continue on this retro-United path and go 442

That sound you hear is Woodward chewing a pen to a pulp whilst fretting over how he might not get to make his load-blowing signing.

338~~~[3]
Anyone who watches the academy on a regular basis, how good has he been for the u 18/21's ?

339~~~[3]
Yorke and Cole, Rooney as the Sheringham and a young Keane as Solskjær? I can dream right?

340~~~[4]
Yeah he used to play as a winger. A front 3 of Martial, Rashford, and Memphis could rival Barcelona for the greatest front 3 of all time.

341~~~[3]
seriously....<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

342~~~[4]
Surprise package of the season. Don't think he will wind up to be another Macheda. He has some serious pace and is actually decent on the ball. Hope he builds on from here.

343~~~[4]
This is key for me. He can make it here.

344~~~[5]
Brilliant again. Can't believe not only the goals but to lead from the front as a lone striker is not easy for anyone but for an 18yo to be doing it for United is ridiculous. His touches and awareness have given me a lot of confidence that he's got what it takes. Would love to see him Martial & Depay in the same side.

345~~~[4]
Can't explain how happy this kids made me in the last 72 hours.

Nothing better then our youngsters shining through.

346~~~[4]
He could be very decent cutting in from the right on his left foot with his pace and trickery.

347~~~[3]
He has a relevant thread in the reserves/youth section covering Jun 2012 until this week. All 4 pages of it; which rather goes to show just how unexpected his rise has been. He was considered a promising wide forward until last season. <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/marcus-rashford.354968/page-4">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/marcus-rashford.354968/page-4</a>

Thanks

349~~~[3]
Locked. Or I don't have the right access it seems.

350~~~[4]
What a week for the kid. Dare I say it, the new Patrick Kluivert?
