tis the season.

whether he gets deployed as a striker or any of the positions behind it, here's to hoping adnan forgets what happened last year and goes back to the promise he displayed in his first season. 

having a good preseason will be absolutely key for him.

2~~~[3]
He still looks the same physically as he did when he broke through, I'm hoping for him to take a step forward and if di Maria leaves, hopefully he gets proper playing time.

3~~~[4]
May just be me, but I'm after watching footage of the latest training footage and it looks to me that he's bulked up.

4~~~[4]
Looking forward to him this season, massive potential.

5~~~[3]
He'll be 21 next Feb so perhaps it's time!

6~~~[4]
Much needed... Especially if he gets games up front. Hopefully he kicks on this season, he'll get a lot more chances then last season I think.

7~~~[5]
Reminded me strangely of a young Ronaldo today

8~~~[2]
Not a great game for either him or Wilson.

9~~~[4]
Thought he was decent today. Glimpses of his talent.

10~~~[4]
Definitely bulked up, also starting to stay on his feet more.

11~~~[3]
He was far better than Wilson who was pretty poor.

Still think he's playing too much as an attacker. Almost a second striker today.

12~~~[4]
Januzaj can be young Ronaldo, Depay can be prolific Ronaldo. Both at the same time... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

13~~~[3]
Not sure why some people are slagging of Januzaj's performance when his hold up play was the best of any of the front men today. Also showed willingness to make runs behind the defence and moved the ball quickly when he needed to. Created a chance out of nothing also, using his new-found bulk.

14~~~[4]
Before this game I thought Januzaj might not feature as much this season and push for a move due a lack of game time but I think he's going to make a strong case for himself. Boy's growing up.

15~~~[5]
I like Januzaj's versatility - I can see him being useful out wide, at #10 or as a false 9.

Really hope he has a massive season this year and is given the chance to do so.

16~~~[3]
I've completely forgot about Januzaj. I still feel he's one of the best youngsters in the world, he didn't get a proper chance last season most likely due to the balance of the squad and lack of games. 

I wouldn't mind to see him as a number 9 with the lack of striker options we have. He's played there for the reserves and looked quite sharp, he's not going to bully any CB's but he can go in behind or drop deep and run from there. He's got everything in his locker to be one of the best in his position, he can beat defenders from a starting position and has plenty of tricks to leave them standing. In addition, his vision is top class, he just needs to add consistency to that and choose the right moments to play the killer ball. His shooting is akin to Nani's, sometimes wild but naturally a good finisher. 

It seemed last season that he was trying to hard to impress which led to him shooting from impossible angles or being selfish but I'm sure with more game time he will develop into a top player. If not, we need to loan him out so he doesn't stagnate. He's already had a taste of first team football now, he can't go back to the reserves.

17~~~[2]
I think Adnan may go on loan and we keep Di Maria. He looked good when he came on, he just needs to get game time and keep working on getting stronger. I liked his performance though. He was unlucky not to score - eventually those chances will go in hopefully.

18~~~[2]
Why ? He's certainly talented, but excepting a handful of games under Moyes, he has not shown any indication that he is improving over the past 20 months or so.

19~~~[3]
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2WF4m7fAp_s?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Januzaj needs to be on the ball more and have some sort of freedom to pull the strings. Out of the youth players we have he's the best at it. It's a shame that he keeps getting played in positions where he sees so little of the ball. Sometimes I feel his all around ability could be a detriment to his progress. Gribbin is a similar player.

20~~~[3]
Thought he looked good, and improved physically it seemed. Think he will have a much better season, hope his confidence grows because it seemed it was back

21~~~[3]
If we isn't used much this year I think he should go on a loan, he's grown quite a bit recently and looks pretty tall now, certainly has got Stronger too. I think he could grow to be a pastore/kaka type CAM, but he really does need games now. Looked sharp with Wilson and Pereira anyway.

22~~~[4]
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBq9PHIwq3I?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe> So easily forgotten what this young lad is capable of.

23~~~[4]
I agree with that, I think his upper body looks thicker than before.

24~~~[5]
Really is a super talent. Hopefully it's a clean slate for him this year and gets games and kicks on.

25~~~[2]
Thought he looked good the other day.. Surprised some were criticizing him. He looked a lot more confident then last season, and bulkier, and that was the main problem from last year IMO. He just had no confidence so his performances suffered. Clearly has loads of talent, just needs to have the confidence to try things and not run down blind alleys all the time.

26~~~[4]
I hope he gets a loan to somewhere like Watford. They're building a good team and he's at a level he would be able to play every week and be one of the focuses of the team.

Him behind Deeney or Vydra would be great.

27~~~[3]
Agree with this. He looks significantly stronger to me. Read an interview Luke Shaw did with mutv about both of them bringing one of the trainers with them on vacation to Dubai.

28~~~[4]
He's the player we should build our team around. He needs to be played like how Zidane was used during his career. Can we stop using him as some runner and let him run the show. If we don't do that, he won't fulfil his potential here and we've seen the consequences of letting extremely talented youngsters go. He's imo the player with the biggest upside in the whole squad, let's treat him like he is.

29~~~[1]
Building your team around a teenager who hasn't proven anything yet? 

Seems legit.

30~~~[2]
i think he proved a few things in his first year, don't you?

but suffice to say last year wasn't good by pretty much anybody's standards, so he'd best be getting on with things this year if he wants to have a chance here. just not sure how guys like him and periera will get a chance to show their worth if we're constantly buying players in their positions. i know we're united and we need to be the best, and that requires buying top talent pretty much every window, but i hope our own guys not only get a chance to show their worth but take that chance too.

31~~~[2]
Prefer him on the wings taking on people. Much more entertaining than playing #10

32~~~[3]
he proved he's a talented young chap, definitely, but certainly not worthy of building our entire fecking team around. That's just ludicrous. Very few players should be afforded that privilege, and certainly not when they're teenagers. Ronaldo is the last player Fergie truly built a team around (although Rooney was the focal point for some spells too) and that wasn't until after his fourth season where he won POTY.

33~~~[2]
all fair enough, and to be clear i don't think we should be building our team around januzaj either. i'd hope that most would agree that unless you have messi or ronaldo, it's daft to build a team around a single player for a whole set of reasons.

34~~~[3]
When the teenager is as talented as he is, its worth it.

35~~~[3]
God.

He is so far from the level you seem to think he is it's unimaginable.

36~~~[2]
RooneyLegend is prone to the odd wacky player observation but he isn't too far wrong here.

We're in no position to build around Januzaj as of now, that's an exaggeration. Personally, I think he desperately needs a loan at a club that will offer him game time centrally. When given that freedom I think he'll turn out into something really quite brilliant. The raw talent and intuition is overwhelmingly evident, and I hope it's here at United he progresses. If it's not us, it will be some other club that takes the initiative and plays him through the centre.

End product would have to improve a lot, however. His finishing isn't up to par.

37~~~[3]
You'd think that because of how he's been used in this team. Player usage is very very important to said players ability to reach their full potential. Since he's started player he's literally only played one match the way I mention, and that causes him to try things that don't come natural to him. This then causes him to make mistakes and have people on this forum calling him over hyped and all sorts of other nonsense. 

When Zidane moved to Juventus, they didn't know what to do with him. For the first few months no one was impressed as Lippi for reasons unknown to mankind was trying to turn him into a Redondo like player. He then started using him correctly and the rest as they say is history. 

It makes a big difference and its the reason why some on here fail to recognise just how much potential this kid has. Thinking he's ryan giggs in the making is absurd. We should be thinking Riquelme, Zidane, Iniesta, Valderama, Valeron, Valdivia with him, instead we have a inconsistent winger who can't even decide when to cross the ball or pass. 

We've developed 3 of these types of players in recent years(Morrison, Daehli, and Januzaj), signed 2 other one's(Kagawa and Anderson) before them but unfortunately none has been used that way they've all predictably failed and our midfield as a unit has suffered.

38~~~[3]
He had a decent debut season in which I think he was not as good as people seem to believe (some seemed to have had him on the talent level of Ronaldo, Messi, even Robben when he didn't really show that sort of potential). Very good and definitely showed great signs of promise but it wasn't completely flawless and it's not like his last season popped out of nowhere - there were also times when he struggled in his first season and it was evident last season that he's still some distance behind the level a first team regular winger of Man Utd should be at. First season put some unnecessary pressure on the kid too.

I find comparisons with Zidane or Ronaldo a bit silly because they all seem to stem from the fact that he has struggled a bit in his early career. Not every player that struggles in his early career ends up being the best player in the world, actually nothing in the fact of struggling in the early stage points to the fact that they're going to be world class, quite the contrary and majority of struggling teenagers don't really end up at world class level.

He has some potential clearly and I believe he could easily reach a level where he would be a regular at United because there's a very good player there. He has plenty of distance to go before he reaches that level though and we should definitely not build a team around him at the moment.

39~~~[2]
Adnan and Shaw had a club trainer in Dubai during their vacations to help them train and come back fitter for the pre season... 
He is trying... hope he gets his chance..

40~~~[3]
Cannot agree with all of that. His first season considering he was still 18 (?) and was playing in a shambles of a team formations where he was constantly isolated on the wings was all in all v.good, not decent. His footballing brain seemed more developed than Ronaldo's at 18. He was dribbling, crossing, playing through balls and chipped in with some good and important goals. There was every reason to suggest he's an exceptional talent. Easy to rubbish Ronaldo comparisons having the benefit of knowledge what has he become but for every Ronaldo who made it you've got Quaresma who didn't and he was just as highly rated in the youth Portugal NT sides. I think it's fair to say Januzaj's influence at 18 was as meaningful as Ronaldo's first season when he came here. Doesn't mean he's as talented, though.

I think that season drained him and this is the point where I agree with you. He was carrying us on his shoulders in some games and everyone was like 'imagine next season'. It went downhill from there unfortunately but he's still extremely young for a squad player at Manchester United and he will improve. Van Gaal will find a position for him, he's got a good track at that. Aforementioned Robben didn't know his position when he was 18 and it was Van Gaal who suggested he moved from striker to wing position.

41~~~[3]
The talent is there, but he need to improve his decision-making and end-products before playing a main role in this team.
Either a loan or as an impact sub would be his role for next season.

42~~~[3]
LVG needs to play a fecking 4-2-3-1 already and give the front 4 chance to roam around.

That would suit Januzaj best right now and is also most suited to rest of our squad like Di Maria, Rooney, Mata and even Depay.

But he seems to prefer playing 4-4-2 or a very rigid 4-3-3.



I think Januzaj is best on the right, with a license to roam in. Though the 2 shots he took in the last game was interesting and pretty good. That's a aspect of his game that is improving.

43~~~[2]
Struggled to get into the game, I don't think the left wing is his most comfortable position.

44~~~[1]
Not his best performance. Needs a loan where he can play consistently to rebuild his confidence.

45~~~[1]
Yeah his confidence looks shot. Nothing happens instinctively, he overthinks everything and that really neutralizes his biggest strengths as a player.

46~~~[1]
Seems LVG has instructed him to cut down on risks he takes plus he ended up being doubled team almost all the game because Blackett wasn't much of a outlet say compared to a Shaw.

Didn't do anything special but didn't do anything bad either. LVG might be pleased.

47~~~[2]
I wouldn't read too much into 45 mins in which he rarely got the ball in a good position to make anything happen. I noticed one through-ball to Wilson that was over-hit but otherwise the opportunities weren't there. It's not like he wasted several good openings. On one occasion he did a nice flick inside to Wilson who didn't see it coming at all.

48~~~[1]
He needs a loan.

Last season he was trying to dribble like an out and out winger. Now he's just happy to play a full 45 minutes of passing sideways. 

He needs a reboot, and regular game time.

49~~~[3]
So weird that a talent is really far off from his debut level.

50~~~[4]
I wouldn't read too much onto a pre-season game.Loads of other senior players (and new signings) look average.

51~~~[4]
Agreed. The only thing I'm interested in really is how the players are communicating with one another.

52~~~[4]
I love LvG but it's fairly clear Adnan's natural instincts have been coached out of him to a certain degree. He used to try to take players on all of the time - sometimes it came off sometimes it didn't. I get the impression LvG didn't like the element of risk because it's clear Adnan is reluctant to try at times now, so he ends up playing it safe a lot which is the opposite of what made him so exciting in his breakthrough season.

An Everton loan wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. He's still an exciting talent.

53~~~[2]
If we keep playing him on the wing, we'll see no improvement. That's just not his position. Behind the striker or as the second striker is where he belongs.

54~~~[2]
Senior players can afford to slack off a little (although I usually hate slacking in any discipline), but a youngster like Januzaj cannot afford that because he is supposed to fight for a spot with the main squad. That's how it's supposed to be in training camp: youngsters playing all out to steal a spot.

55~~~[3]
They didn't slack off, they played shit because their fitness level and mutual understanding aren't there yet.

56~~~[1]
I've said from the start he's massively overrated on here. 

Him and sterling broke through at roughly the same time and look how for sterling has gone whereas Januzaj has gone nowhere in his development. He really needs a loan for regular games.

57~~~[4]
He is not overrated at all. What he did in his first season at his age was pure quality; it was world class potential. 

It's clear to see something is wrong in the position he's playing in or maybe following Van Gaals philosophy. I believe he'll be bigger than sterling eventually. Seems like a player that thrives on confidence.

58~~~[3]
He's not overrated he was one of the few good players under Moyes. Full of confidence, great football brain and made things happen. Without getting into a Sterling vs Adnan debate I think if Adnan was given the opportunities that Sterling has had we would see a much more complete player. Sterling has had some pretty poor patches (which is to be expected for young players) but Liverpool have trusted and to a certain extent relied on him so he's been able to keep his development going. If Adnan doesn't play well we don't see him again for a month or two.

One thing I think he really has to do is tie down a position. I thought he was going to become a winger when he broke into the team but he still wants this role behind the striker. The problem is everyone wants to play there these days.

A loan could do him good but I always worry with youngsters we send out because unless they are undroppable managers will always prefer an experienced player who is tied to the club. Basically we need a B team it's mental we haven't got them in this country.

59~~~[2]
Is this opportunities nonsense really true?

He's made 56 appearances in all competitions in two seasons. I think that's a lot of time to improve your overall level of play. He hasn't had to deal with a serious injury either. Van Gaal does have a certain philosophy which can be restrictive but all this he could be at sterling levels talk seems like delusion.

60~~~[3]
Janusaj trying g effortlessly to get into the ball. Blackett missed almost every single one of his runs.

61~~~[4]
Janusaj looks more deadly when he is on the right or playing through the middle.

62~~~[3]
It's pre-season so even I'll cut Adnan slack here. It's meaningless. We won everything last year then lost to Swansea. 

Finding it highly amusing that people want LVG to adapt the team setup to suit Januzaj already though. Until he proves himself, that's never happening and should never happen. 

I get LVG's style may not suit but it's also offering enough for Januzaj to fit into too. Safe ball playing and positional movement. It's basic fundamental stuff and last season his decision making was shown to be very poor because he couldn't cope with that at the level. 

He has it in him to do very well if his application improves. Big year ahead. I'd back a loan in Jan if he gets nowhere before then. 18 months under Louis' training is enough of a chance and enough of a window to judge him by for van Gaal.

63~~~[2]
He probably needs SAF type of manager who as RVP said goes to him and tells him to excite him in tight matches and not bother about failing few times.

64~~~[3]
Very sensible post.

65~~~[1]
Had a poor game. Seems reluctant to take players on and misplaced a few passes.

66~~~[2]
His natural instinct isn't to dribble. I believe what he did at youth level is what tips you off on his natural instincts. He only dribbled on occasion and it was never his focus. What was his natural instinct was to come to the ball with the freedom to go wherever he pleased and build the attacks. You can see that in his first preseason with United and a lot of his matches in his first season. Although under Moyes he did start to dribble a lot more and it did become his natural instinct under Moyes. I believe he was coached to make things happen and because his dribbling had a lot of success he started to rely on it.

Towards the 2nd half of Moyes' season he started to just stay on the wing and dribble. So he had a lot of quiet games, very lively games, and frustrating games. With LVG he does the same thing, but after his dribbling wasn't as successful as under Moyes, he started to be more conservative.

He needs to be allowed to come to the ball and get in the game is what I think. Now that I think about it, I don't think he needs to come to the ball, but he certainly needs freedom to dribble/pass his way to central areas allowing him to act more like a midfielder/10 than a winger.

67~~~[2]
Agree with this, he needs to play in behind the striker with the freedom to move laterally and find space. I don't think Van Gaal rates him highly enough to give him games there though, and his lack of energy and work rate won't help. I sometimes feel he needs a kick up the arse to get himself into games and try harder, but maybe that's not what Van Gaal wants him to do.

68~~~[1]
What exactly has he done though to show you he can be world class, after a break through start he's done absolutely nothing since and I mean zilch. I'm fairly confident in saying He will never reach sterlings level. As I said he needs a loan to get regular minutes, We will see how good he is then. For me though the jury is still out on him.

69~~~[1]
Absolutely zilch? He's had two seasons here. In one, he has basically carrying the whole Man United team at times looking like our only threat. In the second season, he was struggling because of his position.

"absolutely nothing and I mean zilch". Give me a break.. you clearly haven't seen the boy enough.

70~~~[2]
He's scored 4 goals in 2 seasons and 2 of those came in one game. It's Not the quality of a potential world class player. He's no different now to the player he was when he made his debut and If anything he's worse.theres always people coming up with excuses but he's had plenty of matches to,improve and the simple fact is he hasn't.

71~~~[3]
Regardless of your opinion on him its silly to use his goal tally as any sort of barometer of his potential.

72~~~[2]
I'm one of Januzaj's biggest fanboi's on here but I've been underwhelmed by his performances so far this preseason to put it mildly, it's a big year for him and he really needs to show his talent, I'm starting to get slightly concerned.

I think he's struggling with LvG's -less-risks taken- system, also I don't know what the hell has happened to Wilson lately either.

73~~~[3]
Yes because you need goals to judge a players potential. To suggest Januzaj has done "zilch" is ridiculous no matter how much you rate him or not.

74~~~[2]
As an attacking player then yes goals are a good judge of a player. 4 goals in 50 odd appearances  isn't good enough at all, Regardless of age. 

Anyway we will see how he goes next season

75~~~[3]
Januzaj played a little over 1000 minutes last season which is the equivalent of about ten and a half full games, and those minutes were spread across an entire season. There is no way a player can find any sort of form when he's playing so infrequently, especially when he found himself playing in a different position in a different formation almost every time he got into the team.

76~~~[1]
Misused again, another underwhelming performance. If this goes on we're gonna lose a sparkling talent.

77~~~[5]
Fantastic finish. He seems to have a future up there.

78~~~[3]
Thought he was very good today. Obviously should have scored early on but since then I thought his performance was encouraging. Made a lot of good runs behind and looked quick, held it up well and looked a hell of a lot more enthusiastic compared to the other previous games. Maybe as a striker is where his future belongs.

79~~~[5]
Best 30 mins from Adnan for a long time. Looked a real threat.

80~~~[4]
Too talented to not make it here.

81~~~[5]
Looked very threatening and comfortable upfront - delighted he scored after missing his first chance.

Looks stronger and quicker too. Could be a brilliant forward and could get plenty of opportunities in the 4411 as either the 9 or 10

82~~~[0]

83~~~[5]
He's a really talented player, he didn't have the best season last year but I've no doubt he's going to make it. He needs to keep getting minutes, he already offers a lot.

84~~~[5]
He has totally bulked up. It has added a lot his arsenal.

85~~~[5]
He's bulked up hasn't he.

86~~~[3]
Hopefully get's some game time upfront or as a 10 this season

87~~~[3]
Definitely. I don't want to get over excited from a preseason friendly, but friendly aside, we shouldn't sign any more attacking players and keep him in the team. He can play as a striker or behind the striker. Anything central because that is where he belongs.

None of the winger BS.

88~~~[4]
Looks good playing up top. Who would have thought? Hopefully this will bring his confidence back. Januzaj the surprise striker?

89~~~[4]
Best game of the preseason so far. Very involved and excellent movement upfront.

90~~~[4]
There has something dramatic happened with Adnans physique. Strong and lightning fast. 
We should stick with him this season. I have a feeling.

91~~~[0]

92~~~[3]
It looks like LVG was looking for the right position for Januzaj in this tour and i think he found it. Goal, nice attempt which was not as easy as it looked and some good runs. Only mistake he made was a pass to Perreira which was just a bit to far for Perreira.

93~~~[4]
Was very good. Him,  Andrea and Jesse take our attack to the sort of technical level it should be at. Hope he has a great season.

94~~~[5]
He and Shaw took a club trainer on holiday. Both determined to make a success of this season

95~~~[4]
Great by him and he looked very good up front.

96~~~[0]
Suggestion? I am almost certain LVG said it himself last season

97~~~[0]
I like that attitude! <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

98~~~[4]
He mentioned taking a personal trainer on holiday to get himself in shape. Great attitude to have to be honest.

99~~~[4]
Me too. You'd imagine van Gaal would be impressed by that.

100~~~[5]
Was great today, should definitely be an option up front. Looks so much better as a striker or #10 then as a winger, he's too indecisive out there. That goal will do wonders for his confidence as well, delighted for him

101~~~[5]
Great to see him score, pretty good cameo, coulda easily had two, but settled down after early miss.

102~~~[4]
Really pleased for him, hopefully he can get some confidence from this goal! Looks strong as feck, that summer training really worked for him.

103~~~[4]
He did? In any case signs are very good.

104~~~[4]
Actually loooked like a striker, good movement and hold up play. Only looked poor when boxed in wide.

105~~~[3]
Yeah he did, I'm sure of it.

Also played up front too, not sure why people are acting like its a surprise.

106~~~[3]
Yep. I'd be delighted to see van Gaal ignore Cavani and co. and give Januzaj a real chance. He played far too little last year.

107~~~[5]
Great 30 mins, will really help his confidence. 

Also way more energetic than usual, as it should be!

108~~~[5]
Glad he scored and it will do wonders for his confidence. Think he'll have a good season and can definitely see him have a future as a striker and would love for him to succeed in that position (or any other). He's got all the right qualities.

109~~~[0]
A journalist asking an obvious question?

Surely not?

110~~~[0]
<a class="username" data-user="96090, @Santiago_KinderBueno" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/96090/">@Santiago_KinderBueno</a> must be laughing to the bank right now

111~~~[4]
I'm sure I heard someone at United saying he reminded them a bit of RvP as a youngster, and he started off playing wide early in his career before moving centrally.

112~~~[3]
He was good but could have done even better with the the possible tap in for Pereira and his first chance, but looked lively and involved and it will be a huge confidence boost.

113~~~[0]
It was suggested in the article and has Moyes quotes too. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3062396/Manchester-United-want-convert-Adnan-Januzaj-striker.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...nited-want-convert-Adnan-Januzaj-striker.html</a>

114~~~[4]
Surprise striker scores.

115~~~[5]
Really happy he scored. That one he missed earlier wouldn't have been good for his confidence.

116~~~[3]
his hold up play looked as goodd as he played for u21, just let him train finishing and work on his composure and he will be a decent option out there, looked like he is more valued than Wilson now with him JAmes being played out of position to make room for Januzaj up front..

117~~~[0]
Thanks! Didnt know that.

118~~~[4]
Very happy to see him score, friendly or not, he needed that. Don't want a loan for him, I think he can help us this season.

119~~~[3]
We played him as a striker quite a bit before his breakout season under Moyes to toughen up and he did well there so it's not strictly a new position, but it is at the top level.

120~~~[4]
I remember thinking the idea of Januzaj up top was ridiculous but after he's bulked himself up and the way he performed today makes me think he does have a future there

121~~~[4]
We should start Januzaj as our main striker. This is his time to shine!

122~~~[0]
or probably the coach is Schweining Wilson to a Robben type

123~~~[5]
Looked effective, strong hold up play, took his goal well and looks strong. Impressive.

124~~~[4]
He trained well it seems, he bulked up a bit, I hope he'll have a good season.

125~~~[4]
Chuffed for him. Really looked the part when he came on

126~~~[3]
That helps, also I think last season he was almost trying too hard, playing up front means he has to keep it more simple and that benefitted him tonight.

127~~~[3]
Just had a feeling when he came on that the moment he converted one of his many near misses (starting from the end of last season), he would really kick on from there. Hope I'm right and he has an excellent season for us.

128~~~[0]
This guy is relatively new to social media but has been pretty band on with what he has claimed, transfer wise. The response to this Ben character on the 8th is rather impressive..

Was really happy for him tonight. Held up the ball well,  took some nice runs,  and was really pleased he converted one of his two good chances.

Think he would make an excellent striker for us.

143~~~[5]
Love the fact he's put in the effort to strengthen up with Shaw before preseason. It's already showing. Good performance when he came on I really feel he has the talent and composure to become our main striker one day.

Van Gaal apparently praised him highly in his press conference with the written media.

162~~~[3]
I heard one poster from Croatia (Zagreb I think) predicted LVG using Januzaj back in February. Cant remember the name. Something with some Greek god, sthing.

163~~~[5]
He did. Journos asked him a few questions which didn't mention Adnan and he brought Adnan up saying he did well etc.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> you fecking weirdo

169~~~[4]
Looks stronger, can see hes been working on that. 

He looks a confidence player too. Think he needs minutes to improve whether thats with us or even on loan. He only turned 20 a few months ago so he will only get better.

170~~~[1]
So the Caf's back on side, eh? Fickle bastards.

171~~~[3]
I'm sure he will be if his performances warrant it. Certainly did today.

172~~~[3]
He wasn't that much better than he was at times in his few games last season. If he hadn't scored that goal, everyone would be moaning that he was ineffective and 'clearly not a striker'.

He's an absurdly gifted player who, like all other players, will need proper game time if he's going to show what he can do.

173~~~[2]
Needed that goal. Especially after missing quite an easy chance.

174~~~[2]
I don't really remember him being particularly sharp last year. If anything, he was struggling with the mental side his game. Seems to have bulked up and gotten a bit of his Moyes era verve back this pre-season. IMO, he's a confidence player who needs to transition from blowing hot and cold into a player who can do it consistently.

175~~~[3]
Nah, he looked a lot stronger, more confident and more purposeful then he ever did last season IMO. Maybe the odd good sub appearance, but I just don't think he's all that on the wing and that led to him playing poorly. Through the middle he just knows what he's doing and you can tell he's more comfortable, as he can hold onto it, go either way, feed players passes or run in behind. He's your classic #10 type of player, great technique on the ball, creative, but also a goal threat. He shouldn't be out wide I think.

176~~~[4]
His best performance for a while, he looked better leading the line than playing as a #10, the goal was very reminiscent of RvP.

177~~~[4]
Good game for Adnandos, I think after a year of learning under van Gaal, he will become a regular for us this year. In my opinion, he's still the most intriguing prospect out of all the young guys.

178~~~[3]
I dont get why people always want to loan out players. You loan out your average talents, not your top ones. The best way to learn is to learn from the best. You won't learn much when you are surrounded by people worse then you.

We loaned out Cleverly, Welbeck, Tuna, Evans, Fabio, Macheda, Pettruci, Amos, Diouff and the list goes on and on.

Has anyone we ever loaned out came back as a succes? No. I rather have LVG training him every day and him training with the likes of Mata, Di Maria, Schweinsteiger etc then with bottom tier teams.

179~~~[3]
I have a question: 

After he scored that goal the commentator said he got a bit lucky there. I didn't see it? How did he get lucky?

180~~~[4]
I don't think he really played as a 10 in the first game. He played more like a striker in a 2 striker set up. If he played like a 10 he would have dropped deeper and pass the ball around a bit more.

181~~~[3]
Well he got a lot more time because Bartra made a big mistake, sold himself easily and fell over. He still had to stick it away but the chance might have gone against a top CB

182~~~[4]
That might be it, he certainly seemed to thrive with the extra space tonight as Pereira played quite deep behind him like a proper #10.

183~~~[3]
Will be interesting to see where he's going to be used. High hopes for this boy and he looks committed as well. Training before pre-season starts shows how determined he is.

184~~~[4]
I thought he did well but I think some people are getting carried away quite frankly, need better and better performances from him on a consistent basis.

185~~~[0]
Just read page 3. No consistency in opinion either <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

186~~~[3]
I'm still waiting on how that "Will Januzaj/Wilson make it" thread turn out <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

187~~~[4]
Haha.  Yeh too bad i was out and about but aparently januzaj played as a striker and wilson out on the wings as i said.  It's much less confusing when you pay attention to what feet players play with.  The whole positioning of blind,  januzaj wilson are all dependant on their capabilities in space; which comes down to their stronger foot.

188~~~[1]
Well he was shit in the previous two games but this could be a turning point for him, I believe he has the potential to be great but that remains to be seen.

189~~~[3]
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

There's no escaping damobot

190~~~[4]
There is no denying how talented he is. I've always been of the opinion he'll make it and be a star. I can understand people doubting him last year, even if I don't agree with it though.

He looks a bit heavier, and stronger. That extra pre season training with the personal trainer him and Shaw took on hols with them seems to have worked.

191~~~[4]
Took his goal very, very well. Was a good appearance overall even with the 1v1 miss. More of the same please Adnan and we'll be better for it.

192~~~[4]
Good goal last night. RVP esque!

193~~~[2]
Beckham ! True it was a long time ago. And can we really say that Welbeck was a failure?


If Januzaj has so little time at United like last year, it would be better for him to be loaned and improve his game. It must have been a quite frustrating year for him last year.

194~~~[3]
That's very good actually. Will give Adnan a boost in terms of confidence.

195~~~[4]
Opinions on here change like the wind. He was being written off by the masses not so long ago - apparently we overhyped him in his debut season - now he's the best thing since sliced bread again. No doubt he'll be heavily criticised as soon as he misplaces a pass or misses a shot in the next game. 

People just needs a bit of patience. And that goes for Januzaj, Wilson, Pereira, Lingard, Blackett and McNair. They'll all make mistakes here and there, it comes with learning the game at this level and it'll only make them better in the long run as they learn from it. They won't all make it as first choice players but the more chances they get the more likely it'll be that they develop the way we want them to.

As for Januzaj we lacked a striker at times in the U21s a couple of seasons ago and Warren Joyce played him there a few times so it wasn't completely new to him but he did well yesterday. LvG said it was probably a bit easier for him playing against a CB pairing without Piqué in it, so we probably shouldn't go over the top in our reactions, but I'm happy for him more than anything. The goal will do wonders for his confidence and hopefully he will kick on from here and do well when he gets chances in the season, regardless of what position he plays in. Very impressed in his hold up play yesterday. He looked strong and was a good focal point for us which was important as we weren't at our best in terms of keeping possession.

196~~~[5]
He's definitely worked hard in the off season and that has proved dividends so far. I hope we give him a chance this season and don't loan him out.

197~~~[5]
I remember seeing him smash a hattrick in an under 21 game at the start of last season upfront, thought it would help him kick back into the first team at the time. Always thought he was played there out of necessity of a lack of a reserves striker when Wilson was out, but I'll be happy to be proved wrong. So far he's looked more promising as a left winger in the first team where he has played more instinctively than through the middle or the right, which I thought would be his best positions!

198~~~[4]
Good game and hopefully the start of something for this season....

199~~~[4]
Don't think we'll loan him out. I can use using him at times up front.

200~~~[0]

201~~~[2]
He got away with a loose first touch because Bartra slipped. Otherwise Bartra probably would've cleared it. Good finish all the same. 

I don't agree at all that the goal ended up defining his performance anyway. He was very bright and lively up until that point and consistently made the right decisions.

As much as you enjoy sneering at the plebs who lack your flawless judgement on United's young players, it doesn't quite work in this case given we have quantitative evidence from just days ago that just under 2/3 of the caf think he'll make it here. It's just that following Januzaj's poor form last year the remaining third were more vocal and/or you were much more likely to notice their (strongly opposing) opinion.

202~~~[4]
I can see Van Gaal turning him into a striker. He was making great shadow runs yesterday.

203~~~[0]
Oh <a class="username" data-user="58573, @Gaeilge" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/58573/">@Gaeilge</a> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

204~~~[0]
Cleverley welbeck and Evans did. The others that you mention wouldn't have made it at United anyways.

205~~~[2]
Are you suggesting that if we had kept those players at the club instead of loaning them out that they might have been a success here?! 

Welbeck, Cleverley and Evans all benefited hugely from their loans. They still weren't good enough to become long-term first team regulars here - simply because they weren't good enough, not because of the fact they were loaned out. They also spent plenty of time playing with (and in) the United first team so you can't say that they lacked opportunity to play with the best.

206~~~[4]
Whomever said he was a young RvP before these recent showings was spot on.

207~~~[4]
So this was the suprise!

208~~~[3]
Can someone post a video of the goal? I missed the match yeaterday. Cheers

209~~~[4]
He's a lot better centrally then out wide. I still think he'll end up as a #10, but he did well up top yesterday.

210~~~[0]

211~~~[0]
I will claim to be the first, having first stated it here in January 2014.

212~~~[3]
Brilliant, thanks!

213~~~[4]
Is how I feel.

My reaction after the second pre season game was knee jerk.

He's been good in two of them now. Hope he gets lots of chances this season.

214~~~[2]
Im suggesting that if your not good enough to get your spot in the first team after comjng through the academy tnhen you simply wont make it. And should be sold at that time.

This is the exact reason why we keep ending up with average.

Sell them with buy back clauses and learn from clubs who actually do it right.

Theres always an exception and some can be loaned which actually look really promising. But none of the players we loaned in the past ever looked that promising.

215~~~[4]
Is anyone impressed by his hold up play in pre season? He's had a few nice RVP type hold up moments which our other strikers I.e Wilson and Rooney haven't.

216~~~[5]
the pace with which he, Periera, Wilson and Lingard broke yesterday was very impressive

caught Barca out a couple of times

217~~~[3]
Because footballers don't improve while sitting on their backsides. If Januzaj is going to get regular minutes then we keep him here. If he isn't, then a loan is absolutely imperative, and probably the most important decision/non-decision in Januzaj's career. Get it right and we're laughing. Mess him around and we're stifling what I think is a generational kind of talent.

218~~~[3]
agree

219~~~[4]
Good shout whoever that was.

</ul><span style="font-size: 18px"><b>The young forward says he wants to put his lack of form behind him and force his way into boss Louis Van Gaal's plans</b>
</span>
Adnan Januzaj</a> has vowed to put his difficult second season behind him to reclaim his <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United place.</a>

Januzaj, 20, burst on to the scene two seasons ago at United under David Moyes, but found himself marginalised last term under Louis van Gaal.

The Belgium international <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-transfer-news" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford</a>, but is determined to prove himself and has served notice of that intent this summer.

He flew to Dubai with team-mate Luke Shaw and a member of the club’s fitness staff for a week-long training camp to get in the best possible shape for the new season.

“We decided to do it because this season we both have to do better than last season,” said Januzaj.

“Last season I didn’t have many games but this year I have to be fit and get as many games as I can.

“It was our own decision to take a fitness coach from the club with us because I want to work hard and achieve something this season. I think it has helped already as I feel I am getting stronger.

“In Dubai it was about 50 degrees and it’s quite hot here in the US as well, so I think we’re used to this weather and maybe that is helping me more.

“We worked hard doing some other sports and we also worked on the pitch with the ball. When it’s 50 degrees, it is hard but hopefully it helps.”

“I like that position,” he said. "As a young player, I always played there, as a No.10.

"Only in the last two or three years have I been playing on the wing and also sometimes as a striker.” <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/adnan-januzaj-vows-prove-himself-6138061" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/adnan-januzaj-vows-prove-himself-6138061</a>

221~~~[3]
Maybe so.

222~~~[5]
Definitely impressed. He looks a lot stronger. LvG advised caution as it was against a Barça defence without Piqué. It'll be interesting to see him play against the likes of Thiago Silva in the game against PSG.

223~~~[4]
Good attitude from both players. Hope they push on this season.

224~~~[0]
FFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

225~~~[2]
Do you think Januzaj will get much game time this season or will he end up getting loaned out? I hope not because I think the longer they're not getting opportunities at their club the more they become disconnected and start looking elsewhere.

226~~~[5]
Fantastic goal. Bartra slipped but he done very well to bring it down like that and finish.

227~~~[4]
I'm convinced he won't be loaned out. With European games he'll get more game time.

228~~~[5]
He had great composure for that goal, can't wait to see him this season. He's got so much talent, just needs some game time and direction. I think he'd be able to play up alongside Rooney against a minnow team.

229~~~[5]
Hmmm. David Beckham? Gerard Pique? <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

We shouldn't be loaning Januzaj out at this stage. But to dismiss it as an option for top talents is daft, it can be hugely beneficial if you can find the right loan.

230~~~[5]
LvG rarely gives individual praise but on 3 separate occasions he brought up Adnan in last nights post-match interviews, he seemed genuinely excited by what he'd seen.

231~~~[5]
he could be our Muller

232~~~[3]
Muller was already more accomplished by 20.

Much more.

233~~~[3]
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> meant interns of being able to play any where across the front 4

234~~~[4]
ah i see.

I was very impressed with januzaj yesterday. LVG could afford to let muller start at Bayern in a weaker league. He insisted that muller must play. Maybe this season could be really good for januzaj.

235~~~
i hope so. Been really hoping adnan became an important first teamer for us. with di maria off this is looking more likely. Really think hes just fantastic on form

236~~~[2]
You're completely wrong mate.

So, what clubs should we learn from who do it right? Let's take a look.


<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

237~~~[4]
Adnan's skill on the ball and frame allows for a lot of options once he bulked up.  Teach him to tackle and and he could be an 8, teach him to shoot and and he is a prototypical modern 9, and he has always had the skill and creativity to be a 10.   I think it was always a toss up as to where he would end up depending on what a manager saw from his play when he developed the strength to hold on to the ball in the middle.

238~~~[3]
I think Adnan has a weird skillset right now. I think the main things he's shown he's good at are A) knocking the ball past an opponent and getting away from them. He's one of those players who gets to the ball when you think the opposition player has the advantage, it sucks them in and he's away before they know it B) His crossing from the left in his first season was good, some dangerous balls. And C) good balance. Everything else still needs a lot of work and I think you could argue that he doesn't have all the skills needed for any position right now, but some skills which fit every position he's played from the false 9 to the side of a midfield diamond.

I think Wilson is now the one we would most likely send on loan as Hernandez can provide that pace and goals while Wilson goes out, scores a good 7 goals from regular playtime at a bottom half club and improves his ability to hold off challenges and comes back less raw.

239~~~[2]
If said talent isn't forcing his way into the side (regardless of the side), then you have to re-assess just how much of a 'top' talent they are. Probably not quite as good or ready as people think.

It's just as effective to learn from playing as it is simply training (and barely) playing with top players. I thought this was well known.

And Januzaj wouldn't be playing with people worse than him if he went on loan. People suggest a premier League loan (though I think it's ridiculously optimistic to think he'll play week in - week out) and if he did go on one, he'd definitely not be better than his team-mates at any side he joined.

And if he went to some average La Liga side, for example - he'd learn and grow from the increased responsibility and the different perspective that would offer.

240~~~[3]
I already suggested that if you are surrounded by top players you are fine, so if Januzaj gets loaned out to lets say a Tottenham, or Valencia then sure no problem. He can play and learn a lot.

What does beat the entire purpose is when he gets send to QPR or Elche and gets hammered every week. (and these are the type of teams our youngsters normally get loaned out too) Aka team barely has possession, not players to learn a lot from and you barely get forward to attack during games.

Every single united players always says "i learned so much from scholes, giggs, rvp etc" there has to be some sort of truth behind that.

241~~~[3]
I'm pretty sure we can all say that Welbeck was a failure. He never staked a claim to lead our line. Never good enough. Sorry. But, it's the truth.

242~~~[4]
I agree that for a serious attacking talent that you genuinely can see as having a place in your starting eleven, a loan to a poor team is not going to do much. You want your attacker to be involved in attacks not defending/being the only attacking outlet for a team.

243~~~[0]
I don't think he was a "failure". A failure is something like Zaha or Obertan. Welbeck was a key player in our matches against Madrid and is right now playing for Arsenal. Not a complete success but can't say it failed.

244~~~[4]
A success is never sold to a rival club whilst still young...unless you're Mourinho and you think you're better off without Mata. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

245~~~[0]
Not playing much for Arsenal and I think he'll play even less this season. I think we can call it a failure.

246~~~[4]
34 games in an injury-hit season is not playing much? 

Welbeck was a solid squad player who was often trusted to play in the biggest games by SAF. Just because LVG didn't fancy him doesn't mean he was a failure, there have been plenty of good players who LVG hasn't fancied much. Even now he doesn't seem to rate Smalling and Herrera as much as the majority on here.

247~~~[3]
Is that in all comeptitions or?
He wasnt a starter or sometimes was and sometimes wasnt. In any case he hasnt proven we were wrong to let him go and I see him in some mid table club in a year or 2.
What other good players LVG hasnt fancied much.
Also there's no proof LVG doesnt fancy Herrera and especially Smalling.

oh and Fergie trusted Cleverley in some big matches too.

248~~~[5]
After watching the first 60 minutes with Rooney up front it was fantastic to have a striker who has a good first touch, should have scored from the first chance but it was still a great first touch. Check the run he makes for the Lingard goal and you can see that there is potential to play up front. I think it's sad that we have been in no position to ease him in because he genuinely has star potential.

249~~~[3]
Yes it's in all competitions. 
I didn't claim we were wrong to let him go and whether or not he was a starter is a irrelevant as I'm not trying to claim he's some sort of world class player, but he was a solid squad player for us and now he's a solid squad player for Arsenal. That's his role at a top club and he fills it well.
Herrera sat on the bench for half a season while we were clamouring for him to play and is seemingly back on the bench now that LVG has signed some of his own midfielders. There's less evidence for Smalling, but he does seem to rate Jones higher since he started just about every game he was fit last season and now being left out of the 'A' team on tour. I guess we'll have to wait and see on that one.
Off the top of my head Gomez and Riquelme stand out, though I think there were more. He also preferred Young to the vastly more talented di Maria last season, while Valencia was an almost ever-present ahead of Rafael.
Welbeck was obviously a much more important player for us than Cleverly ever was.

250~~~[3]
Rafael
Rivaldo
Riquelme
Di Maria

Oh and Welbeck was preferred to Berbatov, Hernandez and even Rooney in some cases, so your ever so clever Cleverely point is moot

and for someone who moans a lot about moaning, you moan a lot about players who contributed to our success in the Fergie years

251~~~[3]
I didnt say they didnt contribute to our success did I?
Nor did I moan about those players. I just meant it doesnt mean much he trusted Welbeck in big games cause SAF was an expert in bringing out the most out of not very good teams sometimes. It was good then but ultimately it costed us until this day.

Dont know the story about Riquelme and Rivaldo but Rafael and ADM its the right choice it seems.

Well he preferred YOung over ADM cause of obvious reasons despite the fact how much ADM is talented. As for Herrera and Smalling yeah we have to wait and see not jump to conclusions.

252~~~[3]
As much as a I rate him, I don't think he's a generational kind talent.

253~~~[5]
Why would anyone care who's more accomplished at 20? Anyways Janu has way more talent than Muller.

254~~~[4]
His movement is really good but he had me worried after he squandered the first chance.

255~~~[4]
He's not. He'd already be in the side if he were, if we're being honest.
He'll do very well to become as good as Ozil, in my opinion.

256~~~[4]
It would be a stupid move to loan him out. He has the quality and potential and he just needs the necessary confidence and mentality to thrive. Loaning him out will be ruining him altogether.

257~~~[0]
Sorry, what?

258~~~[4]
I tend to agree. Young players of his ability should be nurtured (even he's constantly just being benched and plays in reserves, it is way better than loaning him out, which more or less is a write off and it would be a shame)

259~~~[3]
statements like this are why i tell everyone muller is one of the most underrated players in the game.

260~~~[3]
I think he'll be one of the best players of his age range. But like I've said before, I think he might have to move for that to transpire.

261~~~[4]
Thing with januzaj &  why i alwaya said he was centrally better than a winger was that when our wingers/forwards cut in; our central forward must have ability to manoeuvre on to the sides that are not occupied.  

More than RVP,  i rekon he is moulding in to van basten =D

262~~~[4]
Zidane at 20 was getting a transfer to Bordeux, and he was a generational player. Dinho had only earned a transfer to PSG and he was also a generational talent. Don't think that's the reason he's not, imo the generational talent we had was Morrison, the rest of the big talents all have world class potential, and some have ballon d'or potential. 

Think he can easily be better than Ozil if used in his best position under the right set up. Personally I've never been all that impressed by the german if only due to the fact that although he's got all the tools needed to be a monster classic 10, he still has poor ball striking and generally is mediocre in front of goal.

263~~~[4]
He's technically on a whole different level. He also has a great football brain.  
He's a very good player but he's the sort of player that's making the absolute most of his talent. Let's not lie to ourselves, there are just certain things a player like Muller will never be able to do with the ball. That's the sort of stuff the likes of Januzaj can do.  
Yeah, one of the best, but I don't think he has it in him to be the very best. I.e don't see him as a Zidane or Dinho level talent.

264~~~[0]
That's quite different to what you first claimed, and still quite wrong.

265~~~[4]
Wow

266~~~[5]
you think Muller is technically on the same level as Januzaj? 
Nope, that's me justifying why I think he's got more potential than Muller.

267~~~[5]
Muller actually has amazing technique, Januzaj has more tricks in his locker, but technique wise, Muller is one of the best around

268~~~[2]
Do I think they are so different I would call Januzaj "Way more talented", no I don't. It's not you justifying why you think that, you're clarifying why, there's a big difference, quit now, the road is downhill for you.

269~~~[3]
i think it's pretty funny that people were writing januzaj's obituary after the 2nd preseason game, and now one good cameo and everyone's a believer again.

unbelievably fickle. kids take time to mature and they will always have ups and downs, it would be nice if people can see that for what it is rather than jumping on him or anyone else after one subpar outting. no question about it, if he doesn't have the best cameo appearance against PSG we'll be back to where we were in this thread three days ago.

270~~~[4]
No chance he's one of the best around. He's not even one of the best in the Bayern squad. 
Not much of a difference in this case. I made a statement and to justify that statement I gave reasons why. That justification was just clarification on the matter at hand. Pretty much everything is tied together. How's the road downhill? I think if Januzaj fulfils his potential he'll be a superior player to what muller is now. Surely that can't be that much a controversial opinion. We're not talking some once in a generation player here, we're talking about Muller.

271~~~[4]
He's beefed up. Think he needed that. Hopefully he'll get his chances and take them.

272~~~[4]
<b>If Rooney gets injured, how can United score enough goals?</b>

“You have seen Januzaj and in two weeks Chicharito or maybe I buy another striker. I have to evaluate always that process.” 

Seems to have quite a bit of faith in Adnan upfront. Looked good there, hopefully he'll continue to impress.

273~~~[0]

274~~~[4]
Perhaps it's a bit risky not to go into market for another striker but there are not many options available I guess. Anyway I can't wait for Januzaj to get his chance there even if we don't look particularly world class on the paper. I hope he takes his chances there, needs to work on his composure and finishing. He's got good enough skill set to play there otherwise, good hold up play and great creativity and movement.. he could be used as a false nine I believe..

275~~~[4]
I'd be ecstatic if Adnan develops into a viable striking threat. He has the size, control, and finishing to do just that.

276~~~[0]
He was unlucky not to get on given how poor Rooney was and how knackered Memphis looked in the last 20 minutes.

277~~~[4]
If van Gaal wants a fast, strong and technical player in the number 10 role, I'd rather have Januzaj in there and Memphis playing LW with Young on the other flank. Would add a lot of strength and pace to our forward line. At lease that way Memphis can act as a wide forward with Januzaj holding up the ball instead of him. That way we have a 2nd goal threat inside the box and not just Rooney.

278~~~[0]
This might be LVG's man utd's schweinsteiger moment.

279~~~[3]
I think Moyes would deserve some credit for starting the process to be fair.

280~~~[3]
Moyes never played him as a striker though, did he?

281~~~[2]
He does not look good as an out and out striker from what I have seen. I do not understand what of his attributes makes Van Gaal believes he will be good for us in that role.

282~~~[3]
Did once or twice, against Chelsea and against Fulham. Perhaps he just doesn't like him out wide in West London.

283~~~[3]
Depends on your definition of the role. It has evolved, so so long as a winger has an instinct and some strength, he can play up front. Other than a few exceptions, looking for a striker with 'traditional strikers attributes' would usually mean looking for one who is a bit limited.

284~~~[2]
The problem is, I do not see any poacher esque instinct, pace or even strength(moreso that he has balance) in his ability that he needs to be a good striker. A false 9 is more fitting as that gives him more freedom to take players on and perhap create which might suit him much more.

285~~~[4]
Disappointed not to see him. Thought he should've gotten a cameo

286~~~[3]
Mate he wasnt even on the bench!

287~~~[3]
Injured? Sent to far North?

288~~~[3]
Yeah he should've been on the bench.

289~~~[4]
Cringed today when I saw he hadn't even made the bench, he needs to push for a loan, can't afford to waste another season sitting around twidling his thumbs just because he doesn't fit LvG's perfect mold.

290~~~[4]
Missed him today

291~~~[4]
Agreed. Slap in the face that Hernandez who had zero preseason and was injured got in ahead of him.

292~~~[4]
We needed at least one striker on the bench dont you agree.

293~~~[4]
I do. But I thought that's what Adnan is now? If not, then what the hell is he to LVG?

294~~~[4]
Better to have a proven striker than one how could maybe be a striker. I bet he'll be on the bench in the next game. 
Pereira was on the bench today which I really liked tbh.

295~~~[3]
Johnson out for a couple of months. Maybe they'll push for Adnan?

296~~~[4]
Seems like he's starting. Big opportunity for him to shine.

297~~~[0]
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

298~~~[4]
Hopefully he plays a blinder. He's young, but he could do with a decent season.

299~~~[4]
unexpected to come straight in like this

300~~~[4]
Really pleased to see him start, hopefully behind Rooney!

301~~~[4]
Definitely. If LVG has some faith in him starting though, it indicates to me that he's not going out on loan at all.

302~~~[4]
Brilliant news. Come on adnan.

303~~~[4]
Will be interesting to see how they lineup because LvG already called Januzaj a striker, so maybe Memphis lines up on the left and Mata on the right with Januzaj playing behind Rooney.  All-in-all very excited to see Januzaj get the start, however, I wonder if it is more to silence doubts about his future than to actually play him over someone like Young.  Hopefully if he plays well he can retain his role (whatever role that is) for the rest of the season.

304~~~[4]
Thought LVG would stick with Memphis in the middle and put Januzaj out right, but it seems like he may actually be in behind Rooney. A lot of faith from LVG in him.

305~~~[5]
This will be interesting.  Cannot hazard a guess as to where the next three will line up behind Rooney....

306~~~[3]
he needs to perform today.

307~~~[0]
That's what she said...

308~~~[4]
Come on Adnan Silva!!!! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

309~~~[4]
Big opportunity for him today, really hope he can impress.

310~~~[0]
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

311~~~[5]
Have a feeling he will, otherwise LvG wouldn't take the chance. He's probably been great in training.

312~~~[4]
LvG is trying to do something with the #10 role looking at the players he's been giving a chance there. I'm not sure what it is and how its going to work out but something is sure happening out of the ordinary.

313~~~[5]
He certainly bulked up a fair bit, should come in handy in a tough away game.

314~~~[5]
Interchanging front 4 would be nice if it came off. Unleash them Louis!

315~~~[3]
Could be saying "Pedro Who?" by the end of this. Januzaj isnt going to get a better chance to show what he's got than tonight. No excuses for him. The talent is obviously there and always has been. He needs to perform. He's getting linked to shite like Sunderland of all places. If that doesnt motivate you to prove yourself, nothing will.

316~~~[0]

317~~~[4]
Good job Van Gaal for giving him an opportunity. I am finally actually please with a decision he has made despite the possibility of the end not justifying the means.

318~~~[4]
If he's playing behind Rooney, he'll be spectacular

319~~~[4]
Delighted that he is getting a chance. I hope he is on the right, with Mata central and Depay on the left. If he is central then that's okay but if he is on the left and Depay is in the middle again I will be mutter nasty things about Van Gaal under my breath.

320~~~[3]
He's done nothing so far but you can just feel the quality oozing off of him.

321~~~[5]
BOY WONDER!!

322~~~[5]
And he scores <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

323~~~[3]
*cough, cough* young man <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

324~~~[3]
Great goal.. was poor before it though, hopefully his confidence grows with it

325~~~[3]
Just terrified by 2 year old by my scream of YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!

326~~~[2]
I can't take the strain!

327~~~[3]
haha well I could see it coming! I got chills with that play. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

328~~~[5]
Big goal. That turn was nice.

329~~~[3]
feck the h8ers

330~~~[5]
Great run from the lad, coming into the game well!

331~~~[5]
This cnut is playing better than the seniors. Do not loan him!

332~~~[4]
Lovely stuff. That's likely earned him a starting spot for the next month. Louis's nothing if not a performance-reward man.

333~~~[3]
Does anyone hate Januzaj?

Anyway, he's doing well!

334~~~[4]
Fully agree.

335~~~[5]
It's not just the goal, the kid has moved around really well.

336~~~[4]
The physicality of playing central was a hudle at the start of the half but he has grown into it and took his goal with excellent composure.

337~~~[4]
I'm watching a different game to others I think? Great goal, but other than that he lost the ball a host of times, was knocked to the ground far too easily also. Hopefully he'll grow into the game after the goal though.

338~~~[5]
Lovely goal

339~~~[4]
Pleased for him. He needed that.

340~~~[5]
He has played the position well and, importantly, he has not let himself get caught ahead of the play when we're defending. The big gap that opened up between our #10 and our double pivot against Spurs isn't there tonight. That's in large part down to the intelligent running Januzaj has done. His finish was immense, but we've known for ahead Janzuaj can do stuff like that. What's really impressed me so far is how, he hasn't just run a lot, he's been intelligent enough to know when and where to go. I've always had my doubts about Adnan as a #10 but playing like this, maybe his wing days are and should be over?

341~~~[4]
Good movement, needs to hold the ball up better, but his movement and energy has been very good for us. Glad he scored today, major confidence boost

342~~~[5]
Held up the ball pretty well too, better than Memphis did against Spurs IMO. It'd be great if he can do this on a consistent level.

343~~~[4]
Finding it tough with the heavy marking but composure as good as anyone for his goal. Putting Rooney to shame.

344~~~[3]
Thought he was very poor except for the goal. Far too weak on the ball.

345~~~[4]
He still is bit struggling against the aggressive villa players bit physically at times but way better than before. Also referee gives him no protection.

Anyway the goal showed his class.

346~~~[4]
Usually I'm on the "don't fall so easily"-side, but in Adnan's case, it's become ridiculous. You can only hold your ground for so long while being fouled.

347~~~[5]
I don't think anyone's pretending he's been Zizou-esque. But then nobody has. He's rewarded the manager's faith and made the difference. S'all that matters right now.

348~~~[4]
Needs to protect the ball better but has been good other than that. Took the goal beautifully.

349~~~[4]
He's being man marked very aggressively, it stands to reason that he'll lose a lot of battles. It's what he does when he turns his man that counts, and his reward for it was a goal. 

He's playing well in a very competitive Villa midfield trio.

350~~~[3]
Turned well for the goal, but a bit lightweight and easily bullied. Been fouled a few times but a lot of just being out muscled.
