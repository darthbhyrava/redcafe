<span style="font-size: 12px">Consummate professional most likely stays for another year with us.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/lcnyPkH.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/lcnyPkH.png"/> 

What are your expectations for him this season? Can we expect some sulking, deflation? Or just another world class season...</span>

2~~~[4]
I expect him to be professional, no sulking or sthing, you're an United player (although you hate it), do a job you're hired to do.

3~~~[4]
I'm hoping he stays. With all the changes to our team we need some stability in key areas. feck the fee, he might be the difference between us winning a trophy this season. Trophies > monies.

4~~~[3]
Fully expect another world class season from him, but won't enjoy it as much because I know he'll f*ck off to Madrid for nothing next summer.

5~~~[2]
I don't doubt he has genuine affection for the club, so I don't see his performance levels dropping off in the slightest. Also, he'll want to be Spains number 1 at the Euros next year, and I don't think if he does end up staying, he'll be that bothered, as he'll get a whopping multi-million dollar pay out next year.

6~~~[4]
If he stays he will definitely give his all for the season, and hopefully helps lead us to a trophy. LVG has repeatedly mentioned how professional he's been about the situation, and with the Euro's coming up next year he wouldn't want to end up not being first choice for Spain by being benched the entire year for sulking.

7~~~[3]
Next summer will be a tough one they will need to buy a keeper and a striker..

8~~~[4]
He'll pen a new deal at the end of the season when we've won the PL and the CL, with him being instrumental in both races, of course.

9~~~[3]
He will sign.

10~~~[4]
Pretty much this. If he does stay, I expect he'll perform superbly again, but I'd be shocked if he stays for more than that year.

11~~~[4]
I believe the reports that De Gea was genuinely torn in deciding between here and Madrid and that he has really enjoyed his time here.He is only 24 and sure he will not resent spending 1 more year here.Even if he does resent it, he is a professional and I would expect him to act like it.

12~~~[4]
I don't think he is going to sulk even if he is going to leave for free next year. He knows much more is at stake. He has buddies here and one year will run pretty quickly. He knows what we have done for him these past 4 years, especially Fergie shielding him and he will be ever grateful for that. I think he will give us one more good year and then be off.

13~~~[3]
Sign an extension? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

14~~~[5]
I expect him to have a great season for Madrid.

15~~~[5]
Stays with his BFFs Mata and Herrera and together lifts one or two trophies by the end of the season..

16~~~[4]
Come on David get your hands out of these gloves and sign the bloody contract.. We know deep down you really want to..

17~~~[5]
Top 15 saves from last year... Jesus <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YLeID5fuRsE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

18~~~[5]
Some of those save are superhuman... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

19~~~[4]
Fair play if you keep this guy for another year. The proposed fee was nowhere near enough to consider going 12 months without him between the pegs. 

I reckon he'll just get on with it. No sulking or anything like that. Just 100% every game until he either leaves or signs a new contract.

20~~~[3]
Not sure how to feel about de Gea this season, I'm sure he'll play brilliantly but he's still f*cking off next year.

21~~~[3]
The Euros are coming up, throwing a tantrum and playing like shit is not what's best for De Gea's chances in the Spanish NT.

22~~~[4]
I think he'd happily stay. I'm positive it's his girlfriend and his family that is pushing him for the move and he's actually quite happy here with his United amigos. So if United don't budge it's a happy excuse.

23~~~[3]
It's worth losing him on a free to have someone making those saves for another year. And he will be at his best because there's a spot at the Euros up for grabs.

24~~~[3]
It'd also be annoying having to replace him so quickly if United do end up selling him. With 4 new players and a possible 2 more, we need to ensure the defence keeps it's stability with De Gea in goal. Then we'll have time to assess the perfect replacement before getting him early in the next summer window.

25~~~[3]
And for free as well.

26~~~[4]
I'm still hoping we might make some kind of swap with Ramos. 

I'm sure he is professional enough to give his best, but every single mistake will be scrutinized this season and almost certainly he will have a at least a part of the crowd on his back if he doesn't perform at a very high level. He will be the player under most pressure from the fans to perform next season.

27~~~[4]
Calling it, he's going to surpass Neuer this year, no basis for this other than how rapidly he's grown over the last two years <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

28~~~[4]
In a way, if he stays and continues to improve it will be a bit sad knowing that he will definitely be leaving at the end of the season. Will make it harder to enjoy his performances.

29~~~[3]
he could have another blinder like last season. still wont affect the outcome for him at euros.

30~~~[4]
I thought he was already better this year, to be honest. He had an absolutely incredible season, and was instrumental in getting us fourth. Obviously Neuer is coming off the back of a World Cup and won the league with his team, and De Gea <i>only</i> finished fourth, but individually I felt he had a better season.

31~~~[5]
Its goalkeeper heaven for him here. He makes loads of saves, impresses everybody, gets a lot of experience. You're probably right.

32~~~[4]
If he stays, he might part ways with his smokin hot girlfriend over the course of the year. I'm sure Ed would be there with a £200k-per-week contract for him to wipe his tears on.

33~~~[3]
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/kQ1DCz2.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/kQ1DCz2.jpg"/>

Starts tonight.

34~~~[1]
From his body expression it's obvious he wants to leave us. 

Is that Chicharito near him?

35~~~[2]
Yeah, telling him what to expect at Real.

36~~~[5]
So good at goal. Distribution so so, but again...so good at goal.

37~~~[3]
He just exudes confidence these days.

38~~~[5]
This cnut needs to stay this season. So good he is.

39~~~[5]
I have changed my mind. I dont want to swap him for ramos. I just want him alone even if it means mcnair and blackett in defence. Feck you Perez

40~~~[3]
I knew he would save that 1v1. It will be a sad day when I no longer have that confidence in our GK. His distribution seemed rusty. Although a lot of last season he had Fellaini to aim at too so that probably helped him.

41~~~[3]
Pretty decent for his 1st game in some time. Gonna miss this guy when he leaves.

42~~~[3]
He's not very keen on moving outside the six-yard box, is he? There was a point in tonight's game where Young tackled the ball from Pedro (I think) toward our goalline. Young had to sprint half the pitch to get back (and eventually concede a corner) while de Gea was just standing still looking at Young's efforts.

43~~~[4]
The Bjorn Borg of goalkeepers, ice cool in everything he does.

44~~~[3]
was good but almost fecked up the goal, lucky Suarez hit the post from freekick....

45~~~[5]
Top class performance, again. Hope he stays for another year. His presence is priceless, even 50m from his sale won't get us what he can by staying - trophies. I really really hope he signs an extension, though. That would the signing of the summer for me.

46~~~[5]
Time for Woody to get the finger out, make De Gea an offer he cant refuse. A nice bonus for signing a new contract and make him the top paid player at the club.

47~~~[3]
I'd imagine he's done all of that.

48~~~[4]
I don't care if we don't bring in anyone for the next two windows if we can get him to stay

49~~~[4]
He showed why he's worth much more than 25mn Euros or so. LVG is right to keep him and let him go for free

50~~~[2]
Definitely the biggest flaw in his game. Probably his only significant flaw. Totally glued to his line. Defenders are usually screaming at him to come wide and show for a pass, or come out and claim a ball which he should be cleaning up no problem. If he nails that part of his game, then there'll be nobody better than him in the world.

51~~~[3]
I doubt that we have offered him 300k+/week, which would make him the top paid player here.

52~~~[3]
He had perfected that during the season I felt, but this was his first game in pre season, off the back of a back injury apparently, so he probably wasn't totally comfortable playing libero and maybe wanted to limit his movement to a minimum. I think he's actually quite good as a sweeper on the basis of what we saw last year.

53~~~[1]
He's been having a poor game.

Should have been directly responsible for 2 goals. Though Zlatan let him off once.

54~~~[2]
I hope Perez is watching

55~~~[1]
He's having a shocker, he can't do anything right.

56~~~[1]
Taken off due to poor performance ?

57~~~[2]
Doesn't sound great. Hopefully we keep him, would be annoying to give into Madrid especially after they just renewed Ramos. Would make us look like mugs if we sold now.

58~~~[2]
Can't help but think he's pressuring the club to sell.Didn't look like him today.

59~~~[2]
I was sure that he will leave and I think today pretty much sealed the deal.

60~~~[2]
Personally thought he'd be staying for another year but after today I don't know anymore. Hopefully he doesn't go, will be really annoying for us if we do sell him.

61~~~[1]
We have to sell him if he's going to continue to play like that. It's a real shame that we will end up losing to RM once again.

62~~~[3]
This is the problem with keeping a player who wants to leave, particularly a GK. Every time he messes up people will say it's because he doesn't care and the pressure on him will keep increasing. Not the sort of environment you need to succeed.

63~~~[3]
Strange criticism of him. 

He was great against Barca. Also at times last season and over his career he has been hesitant about coming out. Second half of last season he improved that.

64~~~[1]
He needs to be gone, both for himself and the club. Mentally he's not here and if we keep him simply for the purpose of Woodward waving his cock at RM things won't improve throughout the season. He'll then walk away for nothing at the end of the season and that will be that. This is currently a lose-lose situation, Woodward needs to face reality.

65~~~[2]
I say Woodward do not back down. It's just too bad but I have no sympathy for Dave. Put his ass on the bench if he wants to sulk/is mentally not here, and let it sink in that he's blowing his Euro 2016 chances whilst he's sat there. 

Should have done the right and sensible thing by signing the contract and giving RM no option but to pay up. He's brought this on himself and I do not want us caving in.

66~~~[3]
The issue is whether we want to be pushed by RM again.  I don't mind he had a bad game (it's preseason), because he has been utterly professional throughout the off season and this tour.  Look, his head is obviously screwed up.  That said, when he knows that the transfer window is closed and he is still here, he knows he needs to play well to secure that move to Madrid and be the no.1 for his national team for the Euros (Suarez, the consumate turncoat after all Liverpool did for him, still played hard and sucked it up for one more year before he got his wish to go to Barca).  Perhaps the board (like some others here) is saying to Ed to get real and get some money back from RM instead of letting him go free next year.  But, imo, that makes us a joke and a bitch for RM once again...

67~~~[3]
I'd rather have him sitting on the bench for U21s for a year and loosing him for free next summer than giving in to Real  and their lowball offers.

68~~~[3]
Maybe he just had a bad game?

69~~~[2]
I tend to agree. However, it doesnt really make sense to keep him if he wants out badly. Only if he says "fine I stay for another season" it makes sense to keep him. But then again, we shouldnt give in to RM either. Tricky situation

70~~~[2]
Yes, he's not going to be very motivated this year if he doesn't want to be at the club

71~~~[3]
Euros mate.

72~~~[1]
If he doesn't want to be here I'd sell him. 

I don't understand the sense in keeping him for a year to lose out on £20m odd. Granted if his contract was longer he'd be worth more, but it isn't.

We should of been after Cech.

73~~~[2]
He could do nothing with the second goal. First goal he was in two minds probably about whether to come out of his line or not. Jones and Shaw were closing him they failed and he was too late in coming out. He made a pass straight to ibra in the 2nd minute who shot it high. 

Other than this, I thought he was fine. Johnstone came for getting a few minutes under his belt for the next 45. He didn't look like he didn't care.

74~~~[3]
Like Suarez?

75~~~[1]
It's becoming frustrating, in the club point of view.

We train a player who wants to leave, giving him too much time and consideration. The club is always bigger than individuals. At least he's no forcing anything like the Argentinian's tw**. These two issues are worrying and sending a very bad image of our club of unhappy players

We should sell DDG, lower our fee to 30M€, letting us the time to recruit somebody quickly whether its Cillessen, Leno or Lloris.

76~~~[4]
Once we play him in Europe or the transfer window closes and he knows it's not happening he'll sort himself out and concentrate on the rest of the season.

77~~~[2]
Caught out by the slow pitch

78~~~[1]
Not a good performance by him, but not sure it's got anything to do with his mental state. Just a poor performance.

79~~~[2]
Once he gets his head round the idea that he won't be joining Real this season, it'll be in his interest to do well. And I think he will.

LvG should just sit him down and explain to him (hopefully with a translator) that the club has decided to forego whatever transfer fee in exchange for one more good season from him.

80~~~[4]
His game against Barcelona was really good though. I wouldn't draw too many conclusions from his performance yesterday.

81~~~[3]
Doesn't matter how bad he performs, we can't let him go now without looking like idiots, nobody will take us serious again if we do. It's a matter of principle now.

If he can't stay focused put him on the bench and play someone else.

82~~~[3]
I thought it was just a bad game to be honest. He was fine against Barcelona? I'm sure once the season starts he will perform to his optimum level. He'll be in Madrid sooner rather than later anyway, can't see why it would bother him for too much longer.

83~~~[3]
29 million bid from Madrid according to Independent: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/david-de-gea-to-real-madrid-real-finally-get-their-man-with-29m-bid-for-manchester-united-goalkeeper-10478347.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...or-manchester-united-goalkeeper-10478347.html</a>

84~~~[2]
Accept it and let him go. There's actually no point in keeping him if his mind is elsewhere and we're not gonna play him.

85~~~[2]
Not if we get the asking price for him. It'll be a win if we do, sticking two fingers up at Madrid.

86~~~[2]
That's almost €40m. I don't believe that Madrid suddenly believe that they need him no matter what especially when they have not conceded yet

87~~~[3]
Over €40m, surely?

88~~~[4]
Not sure of the exact rates but it should be around €41m yes

89~~~[0]
The rates are brutal right now. I'm spending euros in London this weekend and getting slaughtered.

90~~~[4]
This would be awful to let him go now, Madrid can't just string it along all summer then expect to get him at the last minute, hope we tell them to get lost.

91~~~[0]
€39.92 by todays rates.

92~~~[3]
Can't believe I'm saying this but if the €40 million reports are to be believed, we should definitely sell him now rather than pay his wages for another year, lose out on the transfer fee, have him sit on the bench (the trainer coach's stubbornness on matters of principle knows no bounds), and watch him sign a pre-contract halfway through the season. The relationship between David and Louis seems fractured beyond repair to be honest, so odds are firmly in the non-extension camp. As for the defense, it does look more secure with defensively proficient fullbacks, Schneiderlin will shield them from midfield, and Romero might make a couple of mistakes, but it wouldn't exactly cost us the season. Don't believe he's as indispensable to the team now as he was last season.

93~~~[2]
Yep. Add the wages there and we are talking for a loss of around 45m euros (33m pounds or so). A big amount of money to lose for a single season, especially without guarantee that he'll play; or that he'll play that good.

In the other side, I would like us to do a Wenger and to ask Madrid for an another 4m or so, just to make it a transfer record. It would be easily to get it, Real Madrid loves to break transfer records and when they'll understand that they are near it, they'll just add the money.

94~~~[4]
You are talking a lot of sense but I don't entirely trust Blind and Romero in that defense, I fear that both are one nightmare performance from having their confidence shattered and us truly fecked. But if Van Gaal has another GK in mind, not that Dutch lad, then yeah get DDG the feck out of this club both for his and our good because LVG is not playing him again.

95~~~[1]
30m are 30m. We should have lined in for a new goalkeeper long ago

96~~~[3]
Perhaps. 

But I don't really share that view on Romero (understand that's not the most popular opinion). Really believe he is good enough as a one season stopgap provided the defensive line holds up and restricts a high volume of direct shots on target (which it has so far, albeit against weaker opposition). That should ideally give us enough time to whittle down the last of targets and sign a new long term (hopefully) keeper come January or the summer transfer window, not really convinced with Cilessen either. The assessment of Blind I kind of agree with. He might have a torrid time against some of the more physical strikers in the league, but then again, he has kind of ***-proven our skepticism so far (long maybe it continue <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>) and operates as Van Gaal's brain from the back. I'm also a believer in Rojo, who is more athletic and can form a good partnership with Smalling, and doesn't shy away from physical contact. That said, you'r right it only takes a couple of games for everything to fall apart, Smalling is the glue that holds the defense together this season. God forbid he goes down injured, might cause an adverse domino effect.

97~~~[1]
29m is not far off the price we're asking for. Accept it and move on
De Gea is a rare talent but his mind is elsewhere. he won't be missed here.

98~~~[3]
The club will have known this was very likely to happen, and will surely have a contingency plan in place. The fee touted sends a message to Real that we will not be pushed around in future.
A season of DDG at his peak, might be worth turning down a significant sum for. But if his mind is elsewhere, there is no guarantee that he would return to last season's form.

99~~~[4]
Seeing Romero play yesterday and John Stones for Everton on Saturday made me wonder why we've had DDG benched all month. Stone's even submitted a transfer request which DDG hasn't done yet he was still picked and played well on Saturday. DDG would have done his job professionally all month.

100~~~[4]
I have thought the same. Just fecking play him. Guaranteed we wouldn't have lost yesterday if he played.

101~~~[4]
He definitely would've stopped the second one, and I'm not sure he'd have conceded the first. Romero is pretty brutal, I really hope we resolve the issue soon. 

I don't think there'll be a problem if we keep him, I think he'll perform fine this year. The Euros are at the end of the year, and if he wants to cement his place in the Spanish team, he's going to have to have a very good season.

102~~~[3]
Let's vent some frustration on them scousers.

103~~~[2]
We go again!

104~~~[2]
LvG and Giggs need to set a meeting with him and get his head on right, we are going to need him this season.

105~~~[3]
He'll be a big reason why we are in the CL next season. Hopefully the CM will help him do less.

I expect 1-0's, 2-1's, 1-1's and 0-0's galore. He'll be the difference in keeping that one goal advantage or keeping a draw.

106~~~[4]
Put him in immediately, obviously, no point in waiting any longer, he'll take a few games to get into form no matter.

107~~~[3]
Luckily, first game is a pushover, will have something to do, but nothing too much or dangerous.

108~~~[4]
If we play him and in January he agrees a free transfer for the summer he should be left rot.

109~~~[3]
Will we get to see him in the Special Suit?

110~~~[3]
Pffft... To the Valdes thread.

111~~~[2]
All I`m saying is what a cnut this guy is, youre at a top club, getting the highest wages any GK will get, have 75k fans at home every match, what else do you want

112~~~[4]
To live with your girlfriend in your home town where you were brought up.

113~~~[0]
Im pretty sure singers and footballers like them dont wait months to meet up and have bang bang time, most are in "open relationships" and do what they want. Theres hundreds of footballers playing in leagues not in their home country, theres also alot of spanish players in the Pl for a while now, this "homesick" thing is very naive and oversimplistic, that he just wants to be home

114~~~[4]
That would all be valid if we knew the guy but we don't. He's probably not homesick but most definitely he'd prefer to live in Madrid and he'll be there soon enough and good luck to him if you ask me.

115~~~[4]
He never handed in a transfer request and has hasn't publically said anything. Ronaldo compared himself to a slave when he wanted to leave. De Gea's behaviour has been fine and I'm sure he'll play well if selected.

116~~~[3]
The one thing LVG and Ed need to make clear to him is that we were willing to sell but Real fecked it up. A chance to show some man management ability. Hopefully he doesn't hold this all against us and is amenable a new contract with bigger wages and a reasonable release clause. Everyone's *almost* happy.

117~~~[3]
Yes because that's all there is to life. Wise up.

118~~~[3]
He's just too good of a player to drop, he will get some stick at the first game but supporters will get over it. He will leave on a free in the end but that's our fault for not tying him up with a long contract, can't really hate the guy for wanting to play for Madrid, it's not like he wants to sign for league rival like City or Chelsea.

119~~~[4]
I just want to see him one more time at least. Just once more, making miraculous saves. He'll be off at the end of the season but Van Gaal better at least put him back in. He's our best GK by a long, long way.

120~~~[3]
Did he play for Spain?

121~~~[3]
Nope.

122~~~[2]
So again Casillas?

Drop him already!

123~~~[3]
Casillas apparently. 

It gives me hope for him signing that deal with a view to settle his situation, get back in the side and earn his spot for the Euros. 

There's no way he wants to be the centre of drama for a year and miss out next year.

124~~~[3]
Casillas' status in Spanish national side is beyond a joke.

125~~~[3]
It's no different to the Gerrard-Lampard selection. Both of whom had built up strong relationships with journalists who had made their non-selection difficult for the manager. 

If they weren't selected you could guarantee questions would be asked about the manager.

126~~~[0]
why is there a dot in the thread title? special attention?

127~~~[4]
Look at the furor that accompanied Raul being dropped in 2008. It seems hierarchy plays a huge role in the Spanish set up. I have always believed Casillas would be number one for the Euros regardless of De Gea's form.

128~~~[4]

David when he was a little boy.

129~~~[3]
Funny how many Spaniards look so, uh, not Spanish.

130~~~[4]
Just watched Sunday supplement apparently DDG is the victim in all this transfer mess! Lol hope LVG doesn't allow him to pull on the united shirt again!

131~~~[0]
You sure that's not a picture of him now in a wig?

132~~~[4]
Haha, he hasn't changed much yeah. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

133~~~[0]
Why?

134~~~[1]
I've decided to take the nip with him Cheesy. Heard he's not happy with United! Excuse me but are we not paying him bucketloads to play for us? Hardly a hardship there ungrateful little fecker. I would prefer somebody who wants to be here than have someone who is about to jump as soon as his contract is up. Feck him let him sit out for a year.

135~~~[4]
Ronaldo wanted to leave, and wasn't particularly happy in his final year at times. We still played him though, because he was our best player. De Gea's entitled to want to leave: it might be shite for us, but he's not gone to the point of treating the club like Tevez treated City, for example. He's still here, and we'd be daft not to use him while we can.

136~~~[1]
We got £80m for Ronnie and he signed a new deal so we'd get paid! DDG the snake is going to slink out without us getting a penny!

137~~~[3]
Possibly. He could potentially sign a new deal, although I'll admit I'm not entirely convinced he will.

Even then though, it's not De Gea's job to get us a transfer fee: we should've had a more long-term contract tied up a couple of years ago if we were going to moan about not getting a fee for him.

138~~~[1]
I'd agree with that just think we could have DDG and Pogba for the next 5 years. But I do think DDG has strung us along for last 2 years.

Played 90 minutes and kept a clean sheet for Spain tonight away to Macedonia. Anyone watch the game and know how he did? Hopefully he looked sharp and it gives him more of a chance to start on Saturday.

141~~~[2]
We should learn our lesson from this ..It is naive to think that all our players will decide to stay when given renewals in the last year of their contracts..Keep the renewals with a year to go to the Young and the Valencia's of this world..but with 2 and a half years left with our bigger names, we should be discussing new deals.

142~~~[1]
and you don't think we opened talks with De Gea with 2 and a half years to go?

143~~~[3]
Neither of us can say conclusively..but judging perhaps from other deals we have had with other players  it appears that we do regularly offer contracts to some players around that 12-18 months  left mark( Smalling and Jones for example),so it may be true here..I'm not attacking the club btw before anyone attacks me..rather what Id like to see us do in future IF we havent started with it, and have contingency measures if the contract negotiations are taking a long time to not end up in a similar situation.

144~~~[3]
Not sure if legit but account does have 109k followers

145~~~[3]
2 and a half years is to late imo

146~~~[3]
That is basically what he said after the match.

147~~~[3]
We offer 4 year contracts usually( with an option for another), so renewing just a year into that new contract would cost us..I wonder why we dont offer 6 year contracts like Madrid do...Well except  with him of course, and that didn't end well...

148~~~[4]
Mark my words for it; our attacking displays are going to improve so much better when this guys gets back. 

Van gaals team is all about distance from the defenders and the strikers and having a goalkeeper like de gea will only allow our defenders to more bravely push up the field. 


Bring it on!

149~~~[3]
You guys do realise that when his contract had 2 and a half years to go, Moyes was still our manager and we didn't look like qualifying for the CL, right?

I'm guessing we did start talks, but DDG and Jorge Mendes probably came up with the excuse that they will only sign if we qualify for CL. That allowed them to run down the clock and now we end up with this mess.

Good job Woody. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

152~~~[2]
Very true, both Ronaldo and Suarez did this for their clubs. I don't know why DDG won't sign the contract

153~~~[4]
He's a goalkeeper, Perez doesn't see them as galactico signings. He surely improved his chances of Real Madrid chasing him by running down his contract to 1 year, although he might extend now given the deal has fallen trough.

154~~~[3]
One thing I have learnt from the Spanish papers this Summer is how they easily tell one story and then report the exact opposite days later..Until he has signed the contract, I 'll remain sceptical.

155~~~[4]
I'm happy to be optimistic.

156~~~[4]
Ronaldo signed a new deal around about April 2006, if memory serves me right, which is over a year before the saga of the 2008 summer and over two years before he actually left. He never signed a deal so we'd get more money for him. He signed it to get a better deal.

157~~~[4]
I've been scarred by football ....Buts lets hope your optimism is rewarded..

158~~~[0]
From the El Confidencial article on Sport Bible Mendes was quoted as saying;

159~~~[3]
We offer four year contracts, with an added year if the club wants, to protect us in case a signing completely flops.

160~~~[0]
Has to start vs the scousers. 

Romero is just a feck up waiting to happen, our backline with the addition of De Gea will be perfect.

161~~~[2]
Barely even touched the ball. Macedonia had no attack. They might as well have put no one on goal and Macedonia still wouldn't have scored.

Looks like Torres.

162~~~[3]
Out of curiosity if Madrid back off from De Gea but he still wants to move to Spain would anyone here consider Claudio Brave from Barcelona? Brilliant keeper. 

Or even Oblak from A.Madrid.

163~~~[4]
I don't think there's the slightest possibility that he'll settle for A. Madrid at this stage of his career. He's one of the best goalkeepers in the world, and despite his quiet nature he didn't get where he is today by not being ambitious. The only clubs he'll leave us for are Real and maybe* Barca.

*Not meant as a slight to Barca, they will obviously dominate football for the coming years, but he seems intent on Madrid, not Barcelona.

164~~~[0]
Jonathan King has just opened a new account on here.

165~~~[4]
I agree 100% but I was just asking would people be happy enough with either keeper to replace him. Just curios, nothing more.

166~~~[3]
Oh, right.

I guess I would be happy with either of them. Preferably Oblak though, as he is younger and not latin <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Edurne, you gloryhunter!

171~~~[3]
Romero would have saved it.

172~~~[4]
Saw him smile a few times during the game.   He looked happy to be playing with us again.

173~~~[5]
2 great saves.

Welcome back De Goat!

174~~~[5]
Bar that one moment of madness, he was good ol' Dave for us.

175~~~[5]
Was brilliant after the mistake.

176~~~[5]
That clip gave me goosebumps <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>  (Didn't hear it earlier in pub from United fans in fine voice) 

Had a brilliant game, couple of brilliant saves and a pity to lose a clean sheet but what a goal it was. 

8/10 performance, started exactly where he left off.

177~~~[5]
Great to have Dave back.

178~~~[4]
Very much so.

179~~~[5]
You see how much the defensive line moved forward when de gea was in goal.  Our defenders were inches away from our own half way line &  that sir is what trust and belief is.

180~~~[4]
It feels like an edurnity has passed since we were all hating on her <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

*Grabs coat*

181~~~[5]
One nervy moment, couple of good saves and composed the rest of the time, great to have him back in goal.

182~~~[5]
Great to have him back.

183~~~[4]
Hmmmm. Bittersweet seeing that tweet. It's obvious she doesn't actually mean it fully, of course she'd want her boyfriend back in Spain with her.
Still, it definitely reflects well if she does it even so - so fair play to her.

Apart from one or two drunk moments, he was great. Good to have him back. Only beaten by a stunner from Benteke.

184~~~[4]
With him we can challenge for a trophy, this premier league could be a weird one with the strength of the midtable teams, they have bought well and now when behind and they have to attack they will be more dangerous than in previous seasons, De Gea's ability to win a match on his own and our stronger defence could be key.

185~~~[4]
The reaction to all three goals.

188~~~[5]
Felt he went with the wrong hand for the goal but is super-harsh given it was such a wonder strike. Benteke defo not good enough for us though...lol

189~~~[4]
I was actually thinking that, especially if he tried use both hands instead of his far reaching hand. A lot of power though so we'll let it slide.

190~~~[2]
head clearly in Madrid

191~~~[4]
Anybody that says he should have saved Bentekes goal seriously has high hopes, the power it came at home and the unnatural curve made it very difficult to judge. 

To be fair he got close to it, but I have no quarrels about that. He made some impressive saves throughout the game though which was pleasing to see, majority of his kicking was good apart from that 1 dodgy moment.

192~~~[4]
No keeper is saving that. Expectations are ridiculous.

196~~~[3]
Agreed.

197~~~[4]
I don't think the comments would be so positive if Romero put in that performance.

198~~~[4]
I loved the save off the mishit, it was a tiny DDG is back moment.

199~~~[5]
So happy to have him back. We gave him a huge ovation when his name was read out at the beginning (they announcer waited last to announce him haha).

His first touch was cheered, his first catch was cheered, and we chanted his name quite a bit. Big win having him this season.

200~~~[5]
The fact that he even dived for bentekes goal says a lot about his ability. He was quick to react and attempt a save even though most keepers would have just stood there watching.

201~~~[4]
It was impressive he even got nears Benteke's goal. Most goalkeepers would have been rooted to the spot. It's that he got a hand near it that some people think should have stopped it but you can't take anything away from the strike.

202~~~[4]
Aside from the uncharacteristic distribution, which we could out down to him not playing a lot of football lately, what exactly was wrong with his performance?

203~~~[2]
I didn't mean that to sound like I thought it was a poor performance, it was definitely a solid performance for someone who hasn't played much recently. But he made a huge error that would have cost us a goal if not for Smalling, Romero would have been crucified for that while it's just getting glossed over for De Gea.

204~~~[4]
Apart from that one error he was good. I thought his save from Ings was impressive, would not have surprised me if Romero had conceded that.

205~~~[4]
Romero would probably have conceded at least two goals off of the saves DDG made today. And they weren't even DDG 'specials'.

Just shows you how good he is.

206~~~[4]
Exactly, they are leagues apart and that's not hyperbolic in the least.

207~~~[4]
Great game for someone who has not played all season barring a game for Spain. Plus we have to remember he is coming back from an injury from last season. Great game I believe and we can only see him get better this season. <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/><img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

210~~~[4]
I am just glad this thread is still available and that the performances are for us.

211~~~[4]
The saves from Ings and Clyne were both excellent, we've just become accustomed to seeing that kind of thing from him.

212~~~[4]
The Ings one was difficult save to pull off, because we didn't know where the ball would end up because of the bounce.

For De Gea they were basic saves though.

214~~~[4]
Same here. IMO prvented two goals from going in. Bit dodgy on the ball but he will iron it out

215~~~[3]
Btw the Sun are saying that there is a 30 mil buyou option in his contract.

216~~~[3]
A little bit rusty but glad to see how disappointed with himself he looked after that mistake kick to a Liverpool player. Played a lot better after that, too. Dave's back!

217~~~[3]
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/report-de-gea-contract-has-gbp30m-buyout_245866.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sportsmole.co.uk/footbal...de-gea-contract-has-gbp30m-buyout_245866.html</a>

He is off next summer for 30 million....

218~~~[3]
Let's wait for a reliable outlet, Sportsmole and The Sun are hardly gospel. Sportsmole are actually citing The Sun.

219~~~[3]
I can't quite figure out why we'd agree to that buyout clause tbh. Seriously hope it is bullshit, which it does sound like, unless there is a lot more to this whole thing than we know about. That figure really is at the bottom end of any valuation of him.

220~~~[3]
Apparently played a part in Blind's off-the-line clearance as well:

"The 25-year-old also made a crucial clearance off the line to deny Liverpool with the score at 1-0 and he credited returning goalkeeper David De Gea for his role in the second half incident: 'It was an important moment,' Daley told us. 'Just before the corner David told me something and that I needed to be there, and I was there so it was good. We laughed about it afterwards.'"

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Sep/Daley-Blind-reflects-on-goal-against-Liverpool.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...Blind-reflects-on-goal-against-Liverpool.aspx</a>

221~~~[3]
"Ey Daley watch the post wont ya? You're not marking anyone you short arse!"

222~~~[5]
Brilliant stuff, not only are his reflexes good but he can organise the defence too.

223~~~[2]
If he doesn't sign then he goes for nothing...the fact that he'd cost Madrid £30m now makes it a great contract for us. I have no doubt that he'll be off and there probably is a clause at a value that Madrid have told Mendes they'll pay, so Madrid essentially take a hit because they messed up the deal. We get a year to agree a deal for a replacement, De Gea gets a pay rise, makes the Euros possibly as a starter and Madrid get a world class Keeper...everyone wins to a degree.

224~~~[2]
I get all that and yesterday reminded us of what we've been missing (if ever we needed it). Would just be happier if any buyout clause was more c£50m and I had a faint and possibly naive hope that he was pissed at Real and might actually stay here beyond this season. We live in hope.

225~~~[2]
Woody wouldn't give him 200k / w and a 30m release clause.

226~~~[2]
I wish I could believe it...in my mind he's already gone.

227~~~[3]
Why not? An extra £100k or so a week to ensure you get £30m, rather than nothing at the end of year...he'd be stupid to turn it down.

228~~~[4]
At least we know he is going to be fecking immense this season again. Just need him to hook up with a local lass.

229~~~[4]
I'd offer up my sister if it meant he'd stay.

230~~~[3]
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>Send him pics! Not sure my brother's gnarly arse will tempt him.

231~~~[3]
He had that one brain fart that almost resulted in a goal but other than that he was really excellent. That save from Ings' shot was something that Romero would have probably let in.

232~~~[4]
I wonder if he could have. Does Romero have the jungle panther agility to block that Ings shot?

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/eFjJLzHgBvP/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

233~~~[3]
Ok why not. But until I something that is not the Sun report it I might believe it..

234~~~[2]
I think he would have saved the Ings one, I think that's a pretty standard save even with the bounce. The second save there is better than I remembered though, Romero might not have saved that tbf. Although I think he probably would have, his shot stopping is one of his strong points.
`
235~~~[4]
You may be right, Romero probably could keep out some of the tough ones, but then he seems to let in some very routine balls as well. That's what worries me the most about him, that bit of carelessness. De Gea gives us solidity.

236~~~[3]
Pics?

237~~~[4]
I don't get why it is universally accepted that he will leave at the end of season.

Real Madrid will be very pissed off if he signed a deal still intending to leave.

238~~~[3]
The release clause is pure speculation. This was a contract extension, very few external parties involves, so even less chance of a news "leak". It's pure speculation from pundits and the media. They probably can't accept that United did not come out as losers in our dealing with Madrid - doesn't make good reading for ABUs out there. Anyway, even if there is a buy-out clause, I can't imagine it being 5mil less than what we had originally demanded from Madrid this summer.

239~~~[4]
I posted this in newbie section, might as well post it here too:

I am not saying he won't go to Madrid, but those who say it's a dead cert should also consider the fact that United have bumped his wages to £200K/week.

Madrid do not pay that kind of wages to a goalkeeper/defender (How much is Ramos on now?) , they would happily pay it to a goal scorer/Galactico but not a goalkeeper. If they do, he would become their 3rd best-paid player behind Bale and Ronaldo. Would he be happy to take pay cut to join Madrid?

Also, If their was any truth behind a release clause (30m), the Spanish Media would be all over it. United might have a gentleman's agreement with De Gea & Mendes about letting him go for a specific amount, but if their was a release clause of 30m in his contract cnuts like Duncan Castles (who has close ties with Mendes) would be taking a lot of mileage out of this story already. Not to mention, Marca and Spanish journos like Gulleam Ballbag.

240~~~[2]
How is it that an average, bitter and bald journalist have close ties to one of the most powerful men in football? I'm not disputing his connection with Mendes, just bloody curious about it!

241~~~[5]
That save was fecking outrageous. 

<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a>

247~~~[2]
Romero would have caught it

248~~~[4]
Most important signing (resigning) of the season.  We lose this game with Romero in nets.  What a goalkeeper.

249~~~[5]
He's incredible!

250~~~[5]
De God.

251~~~[5]
That's 2 points extra thanks to him.

252~~~[5]
God.

253~~~[4]
He cheated on me but I forgive him. Never thought I would. Submissive with Edurne but dominant in the net.

254~~~[4]
Give him another new contract.

255~~~[5]
I Love you!

256~~~[2]
Romero would have saved all of that with his eyes closed. De Gea should have still left for Madrid

259~~~[5]
Nobody can touch this guy.

260~~~[5]
I'm not sure how anybody dispute he's the best on the planet.

261~~~[5]
World #1

262~~~[5]
Thanks for the points again. Irreplaceable.

263~~~[5]
That was what God said when he first saw De Gea.

264~~~[5]
Dave always saves

265~~~[5]
He always wins us points. So thankful we still have him. Could've been a different story if DDG wasn't here..

266~~~[5]
Navas is playing a blinder for Real. I wonder if De Gea will indeed leave next summer.

267~~~[5]
Incredible stop. Did really well to stop the effort from Mane that resulted in the first goal as well. Really hope he is here for the long term!

268~~~[5]
People talk about us not having enough match-winners in the side when De Gea's been winning us games week in, week out. Match-winners don't all have to be attacking players.

269~~~[5]
Can we change the name of this thread to De Gea Football Superhero please?

270~~~[5]
It'll be so difficult to replace him. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

271~~~[5]
He is the best there is no doubt about that.

272~~~[4]
He was brilliant but I am disappointed by what is happening with his kicking , it used to be such an asset but he has been making a lot of poor kicks this season

273~~~[4]
He's a difference maker, you can't underestimate the importance of a world class keeper, almost as important as a world class striker as they have key moments in games that can change outcomes.

274~~~[5]
De Gea eh? So glad he's with us and proving himself for the Spanish team. Not sure what will happen in the future, but Dave, eventually the model gf will leave you, it's inevitable, it does generally happen with footballers and in Manchester you are revered, a God, so you can have the pick of any of the Manc chav ladies going....

275~~~[5]
Amazing

fecking amazing that we got him on a new deal too even though he might leave in the near future anyway, but who knows. Things change.

276~~~[5]
Incredible save. I remember Schmeichel making one of those one handed saves once while on his backside agaisnt Arsenal. And Seaman did that one against Sheffield United that time. DDGs today was similar.

277~~~[5]
Simply no replacing the best goalkeeper in the world, because that's what he is.

278~~~[5]
He is God and Good

279~~~[5]
He is irreplaceable.

280~~~[5]
One of Ferguson's best signings.

281~~~[5]
For me he is the best keeper in the world.

282~~~[5]
didn't hold onto it

283~~~[4]
I'm not having athe Neuer is better than this guy argument.

284~~~[5]
De Gea could make Rajinikanth look mediocre.

285~~~[4]
"Heurelho Gomes without the shot-stopping"

286~~~[3]
Marcotti and Patrick Barclay?

287~~~[4]
Immense. Sensational saves.

288~~~[4]
During the contract wrangle and the long thread made about it, I stated that he was the best GK in the World.
I still believe this.
His saves today didn't really surprise me - it's what I expect of the best GK in the World.

289~~~[5]
Best keeper in the world.

290~~~[5]
Best signing of the season. Class!

291~~~[5]
Simply phenomenal.

292~~~[4]
This can't be an opinion anymore. Neuer is just not as good as DDG, not at all. I never rated Neuer, but I'm not biased, DDG is already better than Neuer/Courtois ever was.

293~~~[5]
Best in the world, no doubt about that. He'll be off to Madrid next summer so I hope we can arrange a suitable replacement.

294~~~[4]
Just imagine, we could have lost him for free next season or got an inferior keeper this summer.

Would have been such a nightmare to have Madrid get De Gea for feck all

295~~~[4]
That summer story has been worth it and it's just brilliant that he stayed

296~~~[5]
That header save... David De Cat.

297~~~[5]
Showed his value to us today with a couple of brilliant saves. Irrespective of what he does next summer, he's invaluable to us.

298~~~[5]
That header save was incredible.

299~~~[5]
Best 'keeper in the world, simple as.

300~~~[3]
If you "never rated Neuer" you don't really know what you're talking about.  Whether David is better than him is a real debate I feel - its close and they're both top class keepers - but "never rated Neuer"?  Seriously?

301~~~[4]
Never rated him as the world's best, yes, seriously.

302~~~[3]
It's not such a ridiculous statement to say he's the best in the world ...it's debatable!

303~~~[5]
He's just insanely good. He really does make saves that he just has no right too.

304~~~[4]
Nah, I doubt he goes at this point. He's our for keeps.

305~~~[5]
I love the sense of focus and concentration on the ball, his ability to track and predict shots as they develop is a joy to watch.

306~~~[4]
I'd love to see a compilation of just opposing fans' reactions when he stops a surefire goal. The hands on head and that "yeeeaooohhwha???" sound - love it!

307~~~[3]
After a tough summer where he slipped down my list of favourite players it is safe to say he is back on top. What a man <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. Won't get into the best in the world debate but all I know is that I wouldn't trade him for Neuer or Courtois.

308~~~[3]
Thats fair enough.  Its a judgement call after all - you're entitled to your opinion about whos the best.  The suggestion was however that you didnt "rate" Neuer generally - which would of course be absolutely ridiculous.

309~~~[4]
It's crazy that he still yet to keep a clean sheet this season and Romero has got 2.

310~~~[3]
incredible to think that romero has to face only 3 or 4 shots on goal in 4 or 5 games yet de gea needs to make 4 or 5 top saves every single game he's played in.

311~~~[4]
Thank heavens for a crappy internet connection and a hapless fax machine at Bernabeu!! We would have been in the 2nd half of the table if it wasn't for this guy in the last couple of games. He will be craving for a solid defense in front of him. What a gk!! World Class!!! Currently he is probably 1st or 2nd best in the world

312~~~[3]
Big reason for this is the shaw injury imo

313~~~[3]
And that he faced teams that offered feck all up front apart from Swansea, where Romero did poorly in.

314~~~[3]
Also true.  Hopefully he'll be rewarded with a few clean sheets soon the guy deserves, although it's clear to a lot of us, and hopefully big Dave is aware of this, just how important and appreciated he is by us

315~~~[3]
He wasn't tested in his first 3 games against poor opponents. He was sloppy and conceded 2 goals in his 4th.

316~~~[3]
that's why i hope the defense can help him a bit here and give him an easier time in goal and get some clean sheets too.

317~~~[3]
Hes a season or two ahead of Courtois in his development. Since Chelsea's defence has faltered hes shown some of the same weaknesses De Gea had in the early stages. Best in the world is tough to say, but best in the league undoubtedly.

DDG also needs to wake up a little. Hes had some dodgy kicks in the last few games, something he is usually excellent at.

318~~~[3]
He seems more hesitant when Fellaini isn't on the pitch. He is usually pretty accurate hitting him when he is under pressure but without the 'Fellaini out-ball' he seems to panic and put them out of play a lot.

319~~~[4]
Signing of the summer! 

I agree, him being the best on the planet isn't an opinion anymore. He had no right to get to that header last night.

320~~~[4]
Made it into the top 10 plays of the day on ESPN even with a full day of NFL games, but they picked the wrong save.  Silly Yanks...

321~~~[4]
His kicking was a bit off but besides that he was just brilliant again. Him and Neuer must be the two best goalkeeper by a mile

322~~~[5]
That save off the corner <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> outrageous.

323~~~[2]
You need to get banned for this blasphemy.

324~~~[2]
I might just be bias but how can people say Courtois is better than De Gea? He's definitely the best in the Premier League and for me the second best in the world after Neuer of course. Don't get me wrong I do think Courtois is class but he's not quite as good as De Gea.

Having a world class goalkeeper is so important, he very rarely makes a mistake and quite often wins points for us on his own. The save from Fonte was out of this world.

325~~~[4]
He has single handedly won us more points than any other player these past 28 months or so.

326~~~[2]
At what point does our reliance on him run out become a worry? If it wasn't for his heroics we'd have been either drawing or losing seeing 66% of our goals came from 

1) Offside

2) Defensive brain fart

327~~~[3]
If you guys haven't in a while, go back and watch the Ferguson last season review, Moyes season review and the Van Gaal season review just gone. <span style="color: #ffffff">(You can find filthy pigs who have uploaded torrents of all three so you can report them)</span>
A homage of all of his best saves in every game, just absolutely outrageous this lad. Love him to death.

328~~~[3]
He was a captain after Rooney went out? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

329~~~[3]
Was he? Smalling went off too and there was no Carrick so he could have been. BFS should really have got it though if that's the case

330~~~[3]
Yeah, Rooney gave the armband to Bastian who gave it to DDG.

331~~~[3]
To be fair, only Rooney, Carrick and Valencia have played more matches for us than him. If he had signed the contract last season, I think that he would have been chosen as third captain, ahead of Smalling.

Happy to see him getting the armband though. Although it was clear that armband or not, BFS was the leader on the pitch.

332~~~[2]
If he signed last season, but he didnt and he wanted to leave the club in the last transfer period which ended few weeks ago! He wasnt able to play from the start of the season because his head wasnt in the right place and now he is the captain of the club, its a joke.

333~~~[3]
ok

334~~~[0]
ok

335~~~[2]
I have no doubt a lot of the other players look up to him ability wise. Let's be honest, he is our best player ability wise in the squad. He is also one of the most senior players and has probably helped many of the Spanish speaking players settle into the squad. I have no problem making him 4th choice captain.

336~~~[4]
Some very good kicking tonight, other than that had nothing to do.

337~~~[0]

338~~~[3]
Basti buttering up DDG for us there, making him feel respected, hopefully so that he stays after summer. LVG's agent. :P

Smart on Basti's end, I'd say. He's probably LVG's inside man in the club, the most trusted one, not Rooney.
All this talk about Rooney being consulted for team selections and cuisine and being made captain and undroppable is to make sure LVG has control over the squad, since they all look upto Rooney. It's a tactical decision. 

Basti's the alpha male there.

339~~~[4]
1st clean sheet of the season for DDG

340~~~[0]
ok

341~~~[0]
He's a <span style="text-decoration: line-through">red</span> green. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

342~~~[5]
In terms of reflex, kicks, and sweeping, Courtois is no where near De Gea. But in terms of dominating the box Courtois is better, arguably even better than Neuer.

343~~~[4]
Courtois is just a massive guy in general, so he is going to outshine both of them. Like you said in terms of those other skills, he is no where near them.

344~~~[3]
Is he? I wouldn't say so, he is prone to coning out for balls that he will never get. I recall the two Thiago Silva headers against Chelsea last season where Courtios got lucky on the first for being in no man's land and then was punished for the second occasion by a goal.

345~~~[3]
No way.

346~~~[4]
I know that everybody thinks that they have the best looking wife, but I truly believe we have the best GK in the World, in DDG.
I said this during the Summer saga and no doubt Madrid believed this as well.

347~~~[4]
I have watched almost every Neuer game in the past 12 month and Imo, he isn't better than De Gea.

348~~~[4]
He has been at the club since 2011 so I think he should be considered a senior player though he's only 24. Times flies!

349~~~[2]
Agreed. He's the 'cool' goalkeeper to like because he does come out for mad balls and sweeping where no other keeper would risk, that's the only reason people mention him being better than De Gea when in fact he's not as good. 

Anytime you see Neuer pop up on a facebook page its because he's up at the half way line dribbling past a player whereas De Gea is in the newsfeed for an impossible save. That's the difference.

350~~~[3]
I'm sure the question's been asked and answered before but have there been many other keepers in history that save the ball as often with their feet? I find it genuinely ridiculous how good he is at it. It feels like he's uniquely good at it.

351~~~[0]
You stole my post. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

352~~~[5]
Three saves today and all with his feet.

353~~~[5]
Nice clean sheet for him, never looked like letting in a goal.

354~~~[5]
Deserves the clean sheet today. Nice leg saves too.
