Delighted for him. Well done.

2~~~
The enthusiasm of youth <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. This should be a wake up call for some of our experienced players who takes their roles for granted sometimes.

3~~~
This kid looks good.

4~~~
Congrats to him.

5~~~
Good work young fella

6~~~
The next Rooney. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

7~~~
What a night for him, brilliant.

8~~~
What a bloody debut!! 

Absolutely delighted for the lad <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

9~~~
hes like the black RVN

10~~~
Great night for him. If this doesn't bring a smile to your face I don't know what will.

11~~~
Delighted for him.

12~~~
Delighted for him. He's top scorer in the premiership for me on my FM save <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

13~~~
Van Gaal deserves credit for this. Always loved how he's given chances to so many youth players.

14~~~
Even putting the goals aside, his movement off the ball looks very good.

15~~~
Sell Rooney, give Rashford and Van Gaal who uncovered him new contracts!

16~~~
Rasher <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Chuffed for the lad

17~~~
Chuffed to bits for him. Now will get the chance vs Arsenal.

18~~~
Midjtylland need to call a doctor....

There is a rash all over them

19~~~
How about that for a debut. I'm more impressed with how he bursts past players though, nice showing of pace.

20~~~
He da man.

21~~~
Still chance for a hattrick tonight. Fingers crossed!

22~~~
That'll be coached out of him as he trains more with the first team.

23~~~
Who the hell is this kid, and why are you in the last 16 now?

24~~~
When is his next injury?

25~~~
Great debut for him. I wonder if you'll start him on Sunday if Martial is out.

26~~~
i was literally about to say the same thing....BTW, GET IN MEMPHIS!!!

27~~~
what a start. looks like an upgrade on Wilson, and younger too.

28~~~
I'm not one for hyperbole but he might be the greatest footballer who ever lived.

29~~~
Nice work lad, hopefully he'll kick on and be given a chance given  our injury list

30~~~
Absolutely brilliant debut! Given the injuries to Rooney, Martial and Keane I think we'll be seeing more of him soon.

31~~~
I've been feeling fairly indifferent during most of the matches this season (personal reasons and because we've been fecking boring to watch), but his first goal fired me up for this game. This is what football is about. Fantastic stuff.

32~~~
I'm the first to lambast those who decry Mourinho's disuse of youth, but, damn, I don't think I cheer harder when an academy player scores.

33~~~
Did very well, a dream debut!

34~~~
Tenner says at least three tabloid papers mention Macheda in their match reports tomorrow.

35~~~
Decent debut. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

36~~~
He's a natural

37~~~
Absolutely buzzing for him.

38~~~
Get in there!

Cool head on his shoulders, that's for sure.

39~~~
Too bad he didn't take the second penalty. Could've been a hat-trick on his debut.

40~~~
who's his agent? better tie him up on long term contract. This guy is the real deal. Rashford and Wilson would compliment each other, I think. I have a dream...

41~~~
It's important not to get carried away. But he is easily the best young player in the world right now.

42~~~
Presumably his contract already runs through to June which, with Maureen supposedly on the way, seems about long enough.

43~~~
Who'd have thought an injury to Martial could be in any way positive.

44~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

45~~~
Well done lad!

46~~~
Interesting performance. I thought at times he drifted wide unnecessarily, giving us no option in the middle. Of course, he was in the right place to finish both chances. Liked the way he stole possession a couple of times. Also showed good pace at times and some creativity with his back-heels. Dream debut really.

47~~~
He used to play Varane, didn't he?

48~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

49~~~
Two nice finishes. Great to see.

50~~~
Rashford, Wilson, Martial and Depay, at least one of them should turn out ok for us long term... please...

51~~~
200% agreed.

52~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

53~~~
He definitely was tonight. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Was great even before the goals. Excellent debut.

54~~~
What a debut. His all round play was good as well. I hope the notion that the system stifles centre forwards dies with that performance.

55~~~
<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>as you like. Him & Martial...the future.

56~~~
Spot on.

57~~~
So all we need to do is convince Maureen that agreeing to his 10m euro signing was part of the small print of his contract.

58~~~
What a debut! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Two classic center forward goals and he showed good movement off the ball all game, constantly getting in good positions in the box, plus he looks decent on the ball as well. amazing to think he wasn't MOTM.

59~~~
Gonna give mertasaker nightmares for weeks this kid

60~~~
Indeed, the way he lost the CB for his missed header (wish he'd scored) was excellent. Reminded me of Chicharito

61~~~
Delighted for him.

If we can get Depay playing like he did today and Januzaj playing like he did under moyes we would have quite a formidabke AND YOUNG front 4

62~~~
He's like a young Martial

63~~~
Even Messi didn't score two goals on debut.

64~~~
Van Gaal taking credit again <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

65~~~
Is this kid rated highly? Whats his chances of making it properly here?

66~~~
Is this kid rated highly? Whats his chances of making it properly here?

67~~~
If anything you're playing it down.

68~~~
THATS how it's done Wayne

69~~~
I was going to say the greatest human but I didn't want him getting big headed.

70~~~
The only one that moved when Mata kept the ball alive. Movement of a true striker / poacher that wants goals. Was happy with that.

71~~~
Wilson scored 2 against Hull in his debut.

72~~~
I like his acceleration when closing players down. He won the ball back several times, could come in handy if he plays against Arsenal.

73~~~
This.  

After martial absence, the easier move was to place Depay at no9 and replace him with Perreier.  But LVG stuck to his principles and it was a brilliant decision

74~~~
No..

75~~~
at this rate, it'll only be another 122 games until he catches up to Rooney. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

76~~~
Was in the right place for a centre forward hence his 2 goals.  At his age, that shows great instinct.  Likewise though both goals were easy finishes, fact remains he was a bully boy with his confident smashes.  Also looked strong when shoulder to shoulder and can also run with the ball with pace.

If Martial is injured for Arsenal, he starts!!!! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  Ironic if he does and Welbeck does not for Arsenal

77~~~
Fairly highly, my take is he's a player that we may have to wait to fully develop physically, he's got the frame to be an absolute monster.

78~~~
Wilson's the better striker.

People were gushing over Wilson after the Hull game as well.. Too soon to build up Rahsford or write off Wilson. Wilson will turn out the better striker imo

79~~~
Marcus Smashford more like... AmIright! OI OI!

80~~~
Hero.

81~~~
Very happy for him. Would love to see him start vs Arsenal

82~~~
So, so happy for him. Great.

83~~~
Unbelievable night for him.

84~~~
I'd say it's 50-50 tbh though depends also on the definition of making it here. Tough to tell fully as he is developing quicker now but still overall hasn't been that great this season.

85~~~
Made my day/week/month/year/decade/life

86~~~
Stuff of dreams. fecking delighted for him.

Brace on his debut. Unbelievable <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

87~~~
Delighted for him! Absolutely amazing debut. Scored two goals and skinned their defenders a few times. Very good technique and pace. I want to see him play on Sunday.

88~~~
He played Santon and Balotelli at Inter

89~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Its funny because your normally such a miserable bastard.

90~~~
Yeah, his movement was definitely very good. Found space well, sometimes ghosting in. Relatively easy finishes, though, but we've all seen vets sky those opportunities over the bar so much credit to him. Hope he gets time and doesn't let the ego get too big. Great debut, but then Macheda seemed to be the next Ole but didn't kick on.

91~~~
His goals tonight were the most excited I've been all season. Delighted for him. Wonder if he'll get the start Sunday?

92~~~
Depends on Martial's fitness i suppose.

If he's fit then Rashford would go back to the bench and if he isn't he starts. Don't think there's another option ?

93~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

94~~~
Wilson was the last and the only one to do the same.

95~~~
Not seen much of him before, but I know of his reputation. Actually looked quite Martial-like tonight in that he is quick, strong, direct and kind of 'no frills'. Hope he can keep it up!

96~~~
Well done to him, got his chance and took it without looking out of place.

97~~~
Obviously he's got a long way to go but I think while Kiko was a predator, Rash has much more to his game. So high hopes for him.

98~~~
Pace, movement, and a poachers nose, all incredibly impressive. 

It was his mentality that really stood out, played with no fear, like he'd been playing in the first team with years, and went for everything he had a half chance of reaching.

99~~~
Fair play to him. We needed a light to be shined in our hour of need and he delivered.

100~~~
Wow what a debut that was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. Hopefully Martial will be fit for Sunday but if this guy does play he could give Mertesacker a few problems. I hope this won't be the last we see of him and that he also doesn't dine out on this (see Macheda vs Villa).

101~~~
At least you've got your head screwed on Nev<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

We have to be realistic and understand that he's good but he won't be winning world player of the year for at least... 2 or 3 years yet.

102~~~
We all make mistakes.

103~~~
Absolutely delighted for him. as a young player, you need that bit of luck that will get your name noted down. Took his chance superbly well and felt so good; with all the negativity floating round the club, to see an 18 year old kid celebrating with his mates/family after scoring on his debut. That's what footballs about. Good luck to ya Marcus!

104~~~
Lived every United fans dream right there.

105~~~
He played well. he will need to grow physically but hopefully he is a player we can rely on in the future.

106~~~
He's manc right? looks like Lingards taller brother and mix of Wilson and Martial, was cheering to his goals like mad! Fecking brilliant debut,  give him 15 years contract

107~~~
With Keane, Wilson and this kid we've some good talent. Some nice movement from him and kept his head when the chances came. Delighted for him. When we play at a tempo, like we did tonight then it makes it easier for these youngsters to do good things.

108~~~
Read this as "hopefully he be given a chance to get on our injury list."

Glad I read it again - let's hope he isn't also cursed.

109~~~
And Will Keane

110~~~
Movement was amazing.

For both goals he deliberately ran away from the obvious direction of play so when the assist passer looked up to cross, he was unmarked and in space.  That's very smart and instinctive thinking.  

Andrew Cole was saying that was his key skill and why he was able to be in position for so many of the chances he had during his United career.

111~~~
That's a sweet stat.

112~~~
Doesn't even have a wikipedia page but...

114~~~
Delighted for Rashford.
Rashford, Keane and Wilson... I'm glad to see that we have young strikers that can cover Rooney/Martial.

115~~~
18 years old...are you kidding me?

116~~~
Brilliant overall performance and two lovely goals. Great start to his career hopefully we will see more of him.

117~~~
I didn't get to see the match but only the goals. 

Could anyone shed some light on how he was for the rest of the match? Was he just playing well or was it class whenever he was on the ball?

118~~~
And this one? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Marcus Rashford (18 years and 117 days) overtakes George Best as Manchester United's youngest goalscorer in ALL European competitions.

119~~~
Welbeck's brother is actually his agent as far as I know

120~~~
Between Wilson and Rashford, who is more likely to make it?

U saw wilson play before and thought he had everything.

121~~~
He was very good. Constantly pressed their defenders forcing them to make mistakes, showed very good technical skills, pace and quick thinking. His positioning was top notch as well. 

He could become a nightmare to play against.

122~~~
He's one of the highest if not the highest paid u18 player we've had so yeah he's always been rated highly. Was always extremely small but has grown about 8/9 inches in the the past 2 years

123~~~
Probably my favourite player ever.

124~~~
He is the black Martial.

125~~~
Jumping in here, I'd say Wilson, at least as a CF.

But Rashford's a tricky one to call since two seasons ago he suddenly shot up in height, and all of a sudden was converted from a tiny, lightning-fast flair winger into a sort of elusive, fast, all-rounder-ish striker. It's hard to know exactly what to make of him nowadays. He's had spells since then when he's been scoring a goal a game, but he's had spells where he couldn't buy a goal too. Wilson's always been exactly what he is, a very fast, very clinical striker who likes to run onto the ball and can score any type of goal you fancy.

126~~~
Pleased for him. Absolutely love it when an academy player scores. Wanted him to take the penalty for the hat-trick but Herrera does seem our best option there at the moment. Great debut in any case. Hope he can continue to improve and be a regular.

127~~~
Looked a complete striker. Direct in his runs and overall had a good game. Really excited. Hope he gets some run now that Keane is out

128~~~

129~~~
He was very good.
Wilson scored 2 on his debut too. I hope some of these kids realize their potential and become a part of the first team squad. That'd be great

130~~~
Looks like he has the potential for a very powerful upper body as he gets stronger. We need more strong and powerful players with physical presence.

131~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

132~~~
Didnt see the game but delighted for the chap.  When you think about the players that have done this on their debut he is on a very esteemed list.

133~~~
Very pleased for the lad. What impressed me the most was that he didn't stop trying to play his natural game even when things weren't going for him. It is obvious that he still has a lot of learning and bulking up to do. The most important thing is that he seems to have the basic tools: pace, technique, and an ability to find space. The next two years will be crucial for him. I hope he stays clear of injuries given his meteoric physical development in the past two years.

The club has some really promising youngsters at the moment: Tyler Reid, RoShaun, Mensah, Axel etc. I just wish we somehow manage to find them competitive game time for their development

134~~~
Reminiscent of a certain someone's debut a couple seasons ago. Both goals are even strikingly similar.

135~~~
I dont know if this kid is gonna make it here or not, but it feels great to see an academy product have a game like he did.

Looked the part last night, very good movement, pace and power.

136~~~
Can we come up with a chant for "Rasher" that involves bacon?

137~~~
Some of the youth that have come on this season have really looked more composed than our first starters. Rashford, C B Jo, Riley, Varela. This is quite good to see.

138~~~
Got into good positions in the box and had some clever touches outside of it. 

Hopefully we start getting loans right, unlike with Januzaj, and we figure out which of Keane, Rashford and Wilson should be here and which can get big minutes at decent clubs.

139~~~
I always had high hopes for him. Thought he had the potential from seeing footage of him a few years ago. Absolute chuffed for the lad <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>.
His development has stalled a bit this season, Let's hope he gets more game time. I really think he has what it takes to make it at PL level.

140~~~
The black， white Pele

141~~~
Has he played a senior game before? I can't be bothered to check and see if he's had a loan spell

142~~~
Absolutely nothing better than seeing an academy kid shine. Chuffed for the lad.

143~~~
The new Wilson!

144~~~
Nope. Been mostly with U18s. Think he was injured too, didn't play much this season. But was brilliant last season.

145~~~

146~~~
I just caught the highlights of the game. I know Giggs rates Rashford, but after he scored his second goal, Albert and van Gaal sort of congratulate Giggs in a way. Was nice to see.

147~~~
I'm still buzzing after watching that performance last night. Can't even begin to imagine what that must feel like for him.

148~~~
He needed 30 mins to get into the game but after that he really got going and grew in confidence. Always great to see young players do well!

149~~~
Great change in pace.  He is rapid!  Cannot believe he's only 18!  He's built like a tank

150~~~
Is it too soon to pit him against Arsenal? I'd love to see him have a run at Mertesacker.

151~~~
Yeah I noticed that. Van Gaal was gently punching Giggs on the arm as if to say "Good call"

152~~~
Depending on extent of his injury, possibly played his last game for us. Be surprised if he makes it to next season.

153~~~
Thinking the same.

He's just had too many injuries.

154~~~

155~~~
Yeah BT showed Butt in the stands after Rashford's goal. Looked chuffed to bits.

156~~~
Maybe there is something in Butts recent promotion

157~~~
That's good news I think. If he's grown much taller recently and already his body coordination and control has adapted to his long legs, it generally means it will get better after he has stopped growing. And it already looked pretty good.

158~~~
With no other option it surely isn't too soon. I wouldn't rush Martial personally as more likely will pull his hamstring for real if played too soon. I say throw him in as he will definitely give the German bean pole a tough time.

159~~~
Imagine he scored the winner against Arsenal.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I'd throw him in there, personally. We're in a position where we don't have too much to lose (CL looks unlikely), and I'd be happy to see us put in someone who's quite clearly hungry, and has a lot of potential.

160~~~
Obviously still a lot to work on with ball retention, but he had a lovely backheel in the first half on the edge of the box and is very very quick. Looks like he still has room to fill out a little in the coming years, so the future looks pretty bright for him.
He didn't seem overawed by the occasion, so if there is any doubt with Martial for Sunday then I'd say start Rashford.

161~~~
For me we have to get Martial back in there if he's fit, which it sounds like he should be. Rashford did a great job, with his overall performance as well as the goals, and hopefully he'll get more game time this season if we can stay in the two cup competitions. But there were noticeable holes in our game play because he's so lightly-built. We put in the best set of crosses I've seen from us in a single game this season, but there was almost no threat to most of them. And the handful of longer balls forward tried by the likes of Blind and Schneiderlin were less successful than usual because Rashford isn't big enough yet to hope to be able to take them down and hold off a defender the way Martial does.

We're so light on senior players we can't afford to leave out anyone who is fit. If Martial can come back in and Memphis maintain some of that form, then we might have an attacking unit to make up for what will inevitably be a very shaky defence.

162~~~
Yep, agreed. This game should serve as a massive encouragement for him to work as hard as he can, but with his age there is obviously a lot of improvement that needs to happen before he gets regular playing time.

He should get a few more games/minues once 4th is impossible, and we need to rest someone.

163~~~
I think we will be okay at the back judging by what I have heard on the recent injuries. Smalling should hopefully play, and that alone will make a huge difference. I don't think CBJ is too serious either, and Rojo is also back and looked good last night.

I think a couple who were carrying something were rested last night with Arsenal in mind.

164~~~
After watching him star in reserve games on MUTV I have to say it was refreshing and fecking surprising to him in the line-up last night, fair play to the lad and long may it continue, superb debut.

Bring on the kids Louis.

165~~~
There was a moment in the second half out by the touchline where he lost a defender with a lovely sway of the hips before breezing past him to cross.

Probably my most enjoyable part of his performance.

166~~~
HopE he plays against arsenal and he plays better than Welbeck at least.

167~~~
Do we risk playing Martial or take a chance with Rashford up front vs Arsenal?

168~~~
Because memphis suddenly remembered he's a footballer <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

169~~~
He has to play i reckon.

170~~~
We should play him. He's a bit of a wild card but we've got no options. We move Depay, and maybe it effects his game. Marcus is still raw but that can play in our favor if he scores. With the injuries we have, it's not worth risking Martial. Having seen what happened to Keane, we have to ask for the same again I think.

171~~~
Would you risk Martial if he has a slight strain?

172~~~
I'd go with Rashford, hope for a draw vs Arsenal and have Martial fit for the rest of the season. Unless one of the top 4 have a huge slump, that 4th position is already too far for us. The EL and FA Cup have to be our focus now

173~~~
Ah ok, might not be too bad then, cheers.

174~~~
Lets put Martial on the bench, Rashford deserves start even though he will find it tough against physical palyers like koscielny and mertesacker.. Memphis vs bellerin will be interesting as well but we play home so we will have the edge

175~~~
great debut for the lad... but one can't help but wonder how envious/sad keane was to see it.

176~~~
Its great for the kid, but the English press unsuprisingly have gone overboard with their praise yet again.

Its not the praise necessarily that annoys me, but true to form, they are only building him up to tear him down if he struggles later on. They did the same with Memphis at the time too.

If Martial is fit, i'd give him a bench role then bring him on if necessary.

177~~~
He's had a couple of knocks but has already played 30 games across various levels this season. I don't get why you'd say his development had stalled this season either. His development in the past year has been excellent and he's starting to look more like an actual striker rather than just someone played there because the team was lacking strikers

178~~~
Definitely hope to see him play against the Arse.

179~~~
Martial and Rashford will be killer!

180~~~
Two good goals but hardly anywhere near impressive on the ball as Martial, and they're only a couple years apart.

181~~~
Some people will never be satisfied. I wonder how it was on christmas when you grew up <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

182~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MvByla0IWNc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

183~~~
Tricky little player. good control. impressed.

If he keeps developing, should be a very important player for us.

184~~~
Brilliant that the lad in the black coat celebrating with him just looks like another fan bit was actually on the bench for United's senior team on Monday

185~~~
Yes, last season he was absolutely fantastic but I actually hoped he would start playing a lot more games at the U21 levels this season, which if I recall correctly hasn't been the case.
Whether, that is attributed to other players being there ahead of him or him not getting to that level development wise, I don't know, but I was genuinely hoping he would get more game time at that level. That's why i felt his development might have stalled a bit.

But I agree, he's improved greatly in some respects. If I recall correctly, last season, his finishing wasn't so great. He would often get himself to great positions, but then fluff his lines. He's improved on that I would say, based on the way he's taken those two goals and what I read about him in the United website.

186~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Oh shit, I didn't realize Dean Henderson was there.

Our youngest player to ever score in Europe, feckin hell

Martial needs to play if fit, but I would hate to leave him out after that kind of performance.  Does he play anywhere besides striker?

188~~~
May be wrong (on his position) but he played as a winger earlier on at youth level but converting him as a striker has matured his overall play and he hasn't looked back since.

189~~~
This man deserves a raise.

190~~~
Kids need just a chance. Had it not been for a fortuitous moment for Paul Scholes, SAF would have never played him. He thought he was just too small for the premiership level. I have a suspicion SAF did not rate Pogba very high.

191~~~
Martial is a special young player. If you're going to use him as a barometer every academy product will be a disappointment.

192~~~
Yes Martial is THE most talented youngster in Europe. Coman may look impressive but to be as impressive as Martial in a floundering team which is under huge media scrutiny and undergoing significant change is an incredible feat. The pressure on the land is immense. Leading the line for one of the world's truly great clubs having just moved into the country for a record breaking fee as well. It truly is astounding.

193~~~
Yeah I think he's been the most impressive in his age group this season. That he's shone big time is such a dysfunctional team, and in a variety of roles as well (LW, ST) puts him ahead of the rest for me. Granted, I've not seen some of the talented kids in the smaller leagues (Neves, Embolo etc.).

194~~~
One thing that bodes well for Rashford (if true based on the 1 game I've seen), is that he looks more physically ready for this level than Wilson has looked in his appearances for the first team. The thing that really stood out about Wilson was just how simply physically underdevelopment (whether actually physically or in terms of rugidness, using his body etc) he seemed to be for the highest level. So hopefully Rashford is further in that curve at this point. Not writing Wilson off, mind you. This aspect is something that naturally does sort itself out over time and experience.

195~~~
There's not many players around who are as good in the ball as Martial, expecting that from someone just because he's a similar age is ridiculous. Not to mention that 'just a couple of years' is actually a long time in youth development.

196~~~
Even if Embolo has scored a ton of goals in his league, which he hasn't, he wouldn't come near Martial. The premier league is the at the very top with La Liga with regards to competition and league strength.

198~~~
Play Rashford up top, Martial and Memphis supporting and Mata behind.

199~~~
Definitely didn't overreact on Christmas! I just see nothing special in this kid. I would be very happy to eat my words though

200~~~
The best thing about Rashford is that he plays like an orthodox centre forward. His movement and channel runs are atypical of what you'd expect and he did everything very good/decently against a poor side.

Martial is amazing but too often he has over complicated situations; he's go for a dribble instead of laying it off and waiting for the return in a more dangerous position (to be able to shoot/get into the box etc). Sometimes you need that magic to beat a player (or 2 to 3 in Martial's case) but sometimes it's easier and more effective to beat the player OFF the dribble/on the return pass/on a defender's shoulder. 

Rashford played a mature game and hopefully we'll see more of it!

201~~~
One of Rashford's best attributes is his dribbling.

202~~~
I certainly didn't mean that he'll score 2 goals on his debut when I said that but thanks a lot.

203~~~
You don't impress easy do you?

204~~~
You've made your judgement on a single game, that's a joke!

205~~~
Really promising debut but we've seen this before and we've also seen players get hyped up to become nothing.

It's a cliche, but this is when the hard work really starts and most simply aren't up to it. Think it's too soon for a start against Arsenal, i'd imagine Martial will be ok and we'll have Marcus on the bench. But if Martial isn't ok then I guess we'll have to start him, a massive test for the lad.

206~~~
If he starts, he'll be all right. His confidence will be sky-high. Players like him play without fear and, despite his age and inexperience, they dream of playing against teams like Arsenal.

207~~~
Who are you talking about?

208~~~
Dean Henderson

209~~~
<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

210~~~
You too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

211~~~
What! I have no idea if he will be a good player or a bad player, where did I mention or even infer that! I saw what most people saw, a positive first display in which he scored two goals, but until he does that consistently over more games I can't tell you how good his potential is. I just can't fathom how you can judge a player on a single outing

212~~~
Chuffed for the lad. It's Roy of the Rovers stuff and irrespective of what happens, he's had his moment. Goes to show there is young talent in the club once given the chance. Fortunately I've watched these young players grow and whether by LVG default or design, we've seen young players given their chance this season.

213~~~
For those that have seen more of him in the youth teams, how talented is he? What sort of player is he or who can he be compared to in style? Also, how is Demetri Mitchell doing?

214~~~
Plays today. Hope he gives Mertesacker a Rash he can't itch! 

I didn't really know much about him prior to Thursday. I had heard of him from looking through the reserve forum. Is he seen as a highly prodigious talent?

215~~~
Take a bow son!

216~~~
So happy for him.

217~~~
Does he remind anyone else of Pele?

No pressure of course.

218~~~
Stuff of legends from this kid!

219~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

220~~~
The new Martial.

221~~~
Sell Rooney asap, feck Ibra and big names, let kid play!! <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

222~~~
NOT A CHANCE. HOW? WHY?

223~~~
I was just going to post Martial 2.0

224~~~
This kid. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Amazing.

225~~~
Holy crap!

226~~~
<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

227~~~
SCENES!!!

228~~~
GOAT!

229~~~
Gwan lad! Bloody get your third today!

230~~~
THERE'S A RASH THERE'S A RASH!

231~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This is wonderful.

232~~~
feck me!!!!!

233~~~
unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lets hope its not another Macheda though

234~~~
Where the hell did this come from? He's good man!

235~~~
Scratch that, he's the new Jesus.

236~~~
It seems like he's not even trying <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Talk about right place, right time.

237~~~
Holy shit hahahah

238~~~
He may well disappear into obscurity after this season just like Macheda but good grief what an impact.

He certainly won't be forgotten after this start.

239~~~
All things considered, he must be worth about £70m right now!

240~~~
Well I think we've sorted our striker problem.

241~~~
Martial 2.0?

Forget that...Pele 2.0

242~~~
Could he become our version of Harry Kane?

As in become a regular consistant scorer

243~~~
A front three of Rashford,Martial and Depay.

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

244~~~
He reminds me of a young Nicolas Anelka.

245~~~
When do we start calling him Smashford?

246~~~
Was he rated well in the youth teams?

247~~~
Pretty well, as a 10, if I'm remembering correctly...

248~~~
I think he's the highest paid u18 we've ever had someone said

249~~~
Not bad

250~~~
Jesus, this guy is an ice cool finisher. Something we've lacked.

251~~~
He's better than Kane was at this age, wouldn't you agree <a class="username" data-user="24632, @GlastonSpur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/24632/">@GlastonSpur</a>? <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/> <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

252~~~
Alright, seems the kid doesn't just come out of nowhere. Very interesting player, United might have struck gold with him.

253~~~
Leave him alone, Spurs are one down to Swanswa at home.

254~~~
Higher than Rooney?

255~~~
Rooney never played in our u18

256~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that would be crazy, think thats just for academy kids.

257~~~
Ah I'm with ya now.

258~~~
Excellent, as much misery as possible should be piled on him.

259~~~
---------Rasfhord-------
Depay---Martial-----Januzaj---

Strong front four of jews!

260~~~
atletico style 442, with martial and roshford upfront?

261~~~
Get the hatto lad. Come on!

262~~~
Well since Glaston only goes by goals to game ratios, Rashford is the best player that's ever played in his eyes.

263~~~
4 goals in 5 shots and 135 minutes.

264~~~
Exsqueeze me?

265~~~
We given him a contract for life yet?

266~~~
He's genuinely looking like a quality player even if you ignore the goals <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
Brilliant for him though, just imagine the confidence flowing through him.

267~~~
Good player, has great natural instincts but still plenty of work ahead of him.

268~~~
Yeah, two big strong skilful Fletcher Moss Rangers taking advantage of the comedy Arsenal style defending from both sides. Fortunately Arsenal are even more Arsenaly than we are <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

269~~~
...typo?

270~~~
Happy for him. Come in when the team's putting some chances on a plate for the forward and he's taken them well. Too early to say much else.

271~~~
The lad needed just 30 min to score 2 league goals. Rooney needed 1300 min to score the same amount of league goals in the first half of the season. But Rooney fanboys blamed the system <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

272~~~
Nah. It's how Van Gaal says "youth".

273~~~
I really like this idea actually, say what you want about LvG but he's left us with some gems.

274~~~
He's gonna hold Rooney out of the team until he leaves for China in the summer <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

275~~~
Feck me...<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

276~~~
LvG: "The juice/Jews academy"

277~~~
4 goals in 5 shots and 135 minutes.

278~~~
Deadly.

279~~~
oh, feel the Rash baby!

280~~~
Unbelievable first week for him. Hope he gets a hattrick.

281~~~
Hopefully this lad gets his hattrick. Very impressed.

282~~~
Probably got away with a handball/red card. But oh well...what a player! Great movement for both goals (again)

283~~~
Everything happens for a reason. So happy for him. Looks to have a great future ahead of him.

284~~~
OptaJoe?

285~~~
Dream start for the lad.  Hate when young players get unreal expectations because of good debuts. Hopefully he continues to get more minutes to develop and prove himself

286~~~
Just watched the replay. Clearly hits his arm that is in natural position, but it looked a bit like he pushed the ball forwards.

287~~~
BBC Sport says he has 4 goals with his first 5 shots as a professional! Already scored as many United goals as Radamel Falcao! The hype is going to be something extraordinary.

288~~~
Bit of a weird time to bring it up. We've clearly been playing more offensively as a team for a couple of months now. Rooney scored 7 goals and got 3 assists in 9 games in 2016. That's partly because he wasn't playing like a donkey any more but also partly because we started to play more open football.

289~~~
Yes I think it's the shoulder move to, rather than away, that makes it debatable. I'm sure Wenger/Arsenal fans will rage about it if they drop points

290~~~
Is he the real deal? 

I mean will he now be our starting xi for now on?

291~~~
Yeah, LvG loves juice and if he's playing well there's no way he'll take him out of the first team.

292~~~
Started as a winger. Converted into a striker. Ironically, his biggest problem at the U18 levels was his finishing. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. 
Feck, has he improved on that.

293~~~
You are having a laugh.

294~~~
Gutted if it's a hamstring<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

295~~~
*phew*

296~~~
Didn't he just get kicked in the balls?

297~~~
Yup.

298~~~
Yeah. Was just weird the way he went down. Would expect something more WWE style.

299~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

300~~~
An assist as well now. Good awareness too. Looks like he's going to take on his men, but sees Herrera's run and slots it to him at the perfect moment. What a performance!

301~~~
He's the real deal. Awareness, decision making, movement, pace.

302~~~
Assist. 

Good hold up play.

303~~~
United have an enviably young front three.

304~~~
Great awareness and composure to get the assist, most youngsters (and plenty of experienced players) would have smashed a pointless shot into the defender.

305~~~
He's dangerous. What a difference it makes (much like Martial) having a striker like Rashford who has pace, strength as well as good drive to make it count.

And Yes, I'm referencing Rooney.

306~~~
Rashford>Messi imo

307~~~
4 goals and an assist in two games.

308~~~
Sign Mahrez and you got yourself a potentially dangerous and fast front three in Martial, Rashford and Mahrez

309~~~
And to think we've still got to put up with Rooney as first choice until he breaks Sir Bobby's record.

310~~~
I'd be very annoyed if Rooney gets into the team ahead of Rashford again, providing Rashford continues to perform.

311~~~
Looks shattered. Can't blame him.

312~~~
Another brilliant performance from the lad.

313~~~
Brilliant today, looks like complete CF in the making.

314~~~
His giggling in the interview <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

315~~~
No, it isn't weird at all. A barely known youngster form the academy exposed the incredibe shitness of Rooney in the first half of the season. Rashford did more in one game than Rooney did for the entire first half of the season! Even if are playing a bit differently now (didn't LVG deny it though?; besides, we didn't attack that much in this game!) Rooney was ineffably shit in the first half of the season and ruined our league campaign.

316~~~
Anyone see him in the post match interview with Shreeves? Giggling like a kid - he is a kid! - throughout the interview, seems like a down to earth guy. So, so chuffed for him!

317~~~
The commentators just said Nicky Butt has been showing him old school RvN videos this week.

318~~~
What a player. What I like about him is that all four goals have seen him be in the right place at the right time... You cant teach that.

319~~~
What a great looking kid, just saw his post match interview, giggling and completely oblivious to what he's become.   Just wonderful.  So good to see the local lad comet through.  I have a feeling his life has changed forever.

320~~~
Wayne who?

321~~~
Rashford for the ballon door '16

322~~~
Class performance, his movement is superb, his finishing is composed and his hold up play is good, the assist for Herrera's goal was superb and he almost got another when he laid it on for Memphis.

323~~~
Seems very accomplished already, makes very good decisions on the ball and he's very relaxed. So happy right now.

324~~~
He is the ideal Van Gaal striker since he is scoring about 80% of his chances.

325~~~
Good thing your not connected to United in any position.

326~~~
Really really confident youngster. Cannot believe how well he's taken his chance.

327~~~
Can't wait to see him and Martial like up

328~~~
Wow, just wow! For 18 years old, he plays with so much experience. Seems to be an all rounder, in terms of play style. He's strong, good in the air, good dribbler, links up play and scores goals. I must say, what I like about him the most is his ability to be in the right place at the right time. All of his goals have come inside the box. He seems to be a natural poacher - similar to Hernandez, which is what we've missed this season. As good as Martial has been, even he doesn't seem to have this natural instinct within the box. 

His story so far reminds me of Harry Kanes, in the way that he got in the team due to injuries and took his chance straight away. Since then, he hasn't looked back. Hoping that can be the same for Marcus Rashford.

329~~~
Same, but that would involve dropping Memphis or sticking Martial/Memphis on the right which wouldn't be ideal.

330~~~
This guy is just insane. Two games and two MOTMs. Keep having to remind myself that he's just 18. Was isolated for long periods but did ever so well. Excellent hold up play, strong in the air, two goals and one assist. DAMN. Something tells me this isn't another Macheda situation. He's proper quality

331~~~
I gave him a 10 today.  Anything less would have been a travesty.

332~~~
Same, 2 goals and an assist on his league debut. Brilliant.

333~~~
Already scored as many as Falcao did for us.

334~~~
Amazing

335~~~
True <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

336~~~
Great knack of being in the right place at the right time. Time will tell whether he will go on to big things in the long term or fade away, but a fantastic story in the here and now.

337~~~
Could have sworn one of the commentators mentioned that Rashford was a winger/played a lot on the wings.  There may be a way to get all three on the pitch at the same time in a system where Rashford's given license to play as a wide-forward.  Or, hell, we could continue on this retro-United path and go 442

That sound you hear is Woodward chewing a pen to a pulp whilst fretting over how he might not get to make his load-blowing signing.

338~~~
Anyone who watches the academy on a regular basis, how good has he been for the u 18/21's ?

339~~~
Yorke and Cole, Rooney as the Sheringham and a young Keane as Solskjær? I can dream right?

340~~~
Yeah he used to play as a winger. A front 3 of Martial, Rashford, and Memphis could rival Barcelona for the greatest front 3 of all time.

341~~~
seriously....<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

342~~~
Surprise package of the season. Don't think he will wind up to be another Macheda. He has some serious pace and is actually decent on the ball. Hope he builds on from here.

343~~~
This is key for me. He can make it here.

344~~~
Brilliant again. Can't believe not only the goals but to lead from the front as a lone striker is not easy for anyone but for an 18yo to be doing it for United is ridiculous. His touches and awareness have given me a lot of confidence that he's got what it takes. Would love to see him Martial & Depay in the same side.

345~~~
Can't explain how happy this kids made me in the last 72 hours.

Nothing better then our youngsters shining through.

346~~~
He could be very decent cutting in from the right on his left foot with his pace and trickery.

347~~~
He has a relevant thread in the reserves/youth section covering Jun 2012 until this week. All 4 pages of it; which rather goes to show just how unexpected his rise has been. He was considered a promising wide forward until last season. <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/marcus-rashford.354968/page-4">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/marcus-rashford.354968/page-4</a>

348~~~
Thanks

349~~~
Locked. Or I don't have the right access it seems.

350~~~
What a week for the kid. Dare I say it, the new Patrick Kluivert?

351~~~
He still looks like a proper striker who is hard to mark unlike Rooney who is nowhere near agile, dynamic, dangerous on the counter and good dribbler as him. I seriously don't see Rooney giving Arsenal's defence headache even in his best form this much.

352~~~
Fantastic again and a bright future ahead hopefully 

Memphis - Rashford - Martial with Mata behind could win us the Europa League 

I just hope Van Gaal doesn't throw Rooney back in by default

353~~~
Drop Mata and play a proper 442. Memphis and lingard can be the playmakers. The link up between those 4 should be good enough to open most defences!

354~~~
The black Pele.

355~~~
Far too early to tell how good this kid could be.. but brilliant start to his career and I would like to thank him for finally giving the fans some much needed excitement.

356~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Seriously though, if he continues like this the prospect of him and Martial upfront is frightening.

357~~~
Backing him to break Charlton's scoring record!

358~~~
I thought lingard was pretty average again today so I'd consider moving rash ford wide right for a game.

---------------Martial-------------------
Memphis------Mata---------Rashford

That front four has bags of pace and I think they can all chip in with goals. For me Rashfords only weakness today was winning the ball in the air which is an area I think Martial is stronger, his pace and dribbling tho could make him tough to play against out wide.

359~~~
That probably belongs in the Lingard thread then. And no he wasn't average. Whenever he's been poor, van Gaal has rightly subbed him off. Sanchez was anonymous today and that's because of him and Varela, but that belongs in another thread.

360~~~
Can he play from the right? When Martial comes back that might be the only open place in the team.

361~~~
442 actually might not be a bad idea against the league's cannon fodder.  Presuming a Herrera-Schneiderlin midfield, of course.

362~~~
Considering I'm talking about Rashford playing on the right that's why it needs to be in this thread! Don't correct someone if your wrong! I agree lingard defended well today, but guess what we aren't playing Arsenal next we are playing Watford so I think we can get away with trying Rashford out wide. What would you prefer? To drop him if Martial comes back. I also think Rashford pressed and defended very well from the front so I don't see any reason he can't do the same thing out wide. Lingard has done ok and I do think he's got a squad role in the club but if Rashford can take this form to the wing we are set.

363~~~
If Rashford is going to stay in when Martial gets back then surely it has to be Martial on the wing.

364~~~
Travesty if he doesn't start up top for England in France come the summer! <span style="color: #ffffff">White.</span>

365~~~
Yeah I wouldn't move Rashford around, he seems to occupy the box better and Martial thrives on space and freedom to roam. It's a nice problem to have though as dropping any of them right now seems harsh. 

We have the luxury of being able to ease Martial back in or protecting Rashford if we don't want to force players around.

366~~~
Chill mate, that's why I only quoted the part you talked about Lingard being average and commented on that. 
Yeah, we could try that. But the thing is Rashford started his career as a winger and has been pretty much working intensely this past year and last year to improve his game as a striker.  So to again put him back in the wings would be undoing his development in terms of movement, natural instinct, hold up play, first touch etc. In fact even when he played as a striker, he had a natural tendency to float into the channels (until van Gaal told him to stop doing that).  As good as the idea sounds, I'd rather preserve the integrity of the lads development long term than looking to see how effective he can be out wide. 

But when Martial does return to the fold, van Gaal will more likely drop Rashford. I'd personally hope we can play Depay on the right and Martial on the left.

367~~~
Thing is I see that sort of opinion a fair bit but some of the best strikers have played from the wing at a young age. Martial for example has been brilliant of the left wing but I still think he will be a ST long term. Personally I think Rashford lacked abit of presence to play upfront, his movement and pace was amazing but I honestly can't remember him winning a header from a GK in a similar way to Martial. It's probably a good dilemma to have but I would just like to give that a try. 
Just quickly regarding Depay, I think his main assets is going inside to shoot as more of a wide forward, I don't see him being able to play as effectively from the right wing.

368~~~
4-4-1-1 let rashford lead the line & martial play behind. 

I wouldn't feck around with memphis either.

369~~~
It doesn't always have to be about winning the header. The funny thing is Rashford was a tiny little fella when he joined the club and then suddenly had a growth spurt at 16 I think. He's got very good jumping ability, maybe just not the bravery to challenge someone for a header. But that can be trained into you over time.  But if you looked at the game, he held the ball up really well with his back to goal. That to me shows a lot of presence, especially considering his build. And if you are to play him in the wing, I think on the left side would be better then. Most of the top strikers, Anelka, Henry all started from the left.
That's precisely why I would like to try him on the right. He has very good technique and tonnes of power. He can use it to great effect on the right. Add to that his skill set and he could regularly get to the byline and deliver low hard crosses or high floaty one's. I think he even played one quarter of some CL game on the right, and had an instant telepathic understanding with Martial.

Stunning performance from Marcus. My MOTM. Hope he isn't out too long, need him to play next to Martial.

371~~~
Wonderful from the 18 year old. Loved the header and the assist showed intelligence. Could have just tried to do it all on his own mechanically but he had presence of mind.

372~~~
Did you guys see him when he took Bellerin out for a run and looked just as fast, at least? He also outpaced Koscielny, who is really fast. Add his blistering pace to his ability to be in the right place at the right time, he might turn out very good. His assist for Herrera's goal was also a great move.

373~~~
I see a Chicharito Hernandez in his game. Runs his ass off, makes clever runs, and is a pretty damn good finisher. However, he dosen't look like much of a dribbler to me or someone who is that technically gifted and can pick out a fantastic pass. I don't think trying him out-wide would do him any favors. He is a pure striker.

Great game today.

374~~~
Wow what a player this lad is, I just hope the club keep his feet on the ground because we see it so often with young players they get carried and mess their careers up. I seriously hope this doesn't happen to him, he's had an incredible start to his senior career and long may it continue.

375~~~
Put the stats next to his name, I want to see them every time I open this thread <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

376~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

377~~~
I wouldn't worry about that as we have Giggs and Butt, who have travelled the same path, to keep him grounded.

378~~~
He's very different to what we currently have in that he looks to have that knack of being in the right place at the right time. All four of his goals have been around the six yard box - poachers territory. He looks quick to seize chances and his finishing looks clinical, he's not scuffing them in, there's composure and accuracy and long may it continue.

Martial is a class act and he has to play but I wouldn't drop Rashford. I don't care who's waiting in the wings this lads confidence will be through the roof and why curtail the kid in this vein of form. Give him a rest when he dries up but not now.

379~~~
He hasnt showed it much for the first team yet but dribbling is probably actually his biggest strength. He's only really added what you'd call proper strikers goals like those he's scored for the first team to his game in the past few months

380~~~
Wrong.

381~~~
If you say so, but going off of what I've seen at the first team He looked a little bit sloppy trying to go at defenders. We will see what he really is as the games go by...

382~~~
Tell me why?

383~~~
He hasn't quite got past or through the defenders when he's ran at them but we are talking an 18 year old kid here who 72 hours ago was nowhere on the radar. You can see he's got an explosiveness about him and if he develops just imagine what a beast we could have in 18 months or so. He will only get faster, stronger and technically better as he matures and although it's early days he's given himself one hell of a platform to kick on from.

384~~~
He has a few times tbh. His first effort on Thursday and the pen he almost won today (if he wasn't fouled he would have probably scored)

385~~~
At this point I'm more impressed by his maturity and mental resilience. The physicality will come over time, but it makes it easier when you step up on your PL debut and act like you've been playing for years.

386~~~
How can you measure his mental resilience at this point? What is obvious to see is the timing and intelligence of his movement. He needs proper development and if that is achieved, watch out.

387~~~
I think Martial and Rashford could quite easily interchange positions. I'd favor Rashford central though as he's going through a purple patch. Let that continue, and I think Martial will get more space now on the wing because teams will be wary of Rashford. There should be a degree of freedom and with Wilson and Keane we are in a good moment. Rashford for me, is in advance of himself. He's clearly thriving and i'm sure there's more to come.

388~~~
Did that fourth official slap Januzaj's arse at the end of that first video <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>?

389~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Just give me a touch there.

390~~~
He was fair enough, but seemed a bit hesitant and ran out of steam quickly. 3/10


<span style="color: #ffffff">JUST KIDDING!</span>

391~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

392~~~
It's Mike Dean as well. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

393~~~
What player, past or present, does he remind you of?

This may be too convenient but he sort of reminds me of Martial when he first came to United.

394~~~
<i>"He reminds me of my younger days"</i> - Martial.

395~~~
Ha ha. I can already see some difference in Martial now from those first few games though - he played with no fear like Rashford is now.

396~~~
A young anelka?

397~~~
Here's an idea.. How about Rashford and Martial through the middle together?

Mata's place shouldn't be a lock. He hasn't had a great season. And Martial and Rashford through the middle would be tricky to say the least

398~~~
Yeah, I can see that as well

399~~~
A central defence's nightmare if they're both playing with confidence!

400~~~
Don't want to get too carried away in this season of one step forward and two steps back, but you could throw current form Memphis into that too and make the defender just want to go home. Pace, power and youth.

Hopefully they get a chance together anyway. Feeling a bit more excited about the rest of the season at least

401~~~
Who in turn, is fairly reminiscent to Martial. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

402~~~
I'm fairly sure from the limited I've seen him in the reserves, his all-round game play is much better than it was today. It's probably got to do with the occasion and the way we were setup. But then, scoring goals is not that easy under those circumstances so credit where it's due. If he can contribute more to the general play, I have no doubts he will have a career here.

403~~~
Seems to have better predator instincts then any of our other players, just keep on playing him uptop

404~~~
What I want from my striker, he doesnt do that BS drifting back into midfield getting into other peoples way. He stretches the game, he occupies the central defenders, hes in the box for crosses, he scores, and can run with the ball.

405~~~
What a dream this guy is living at the moment. Great to see. Long may it continue.

406~~~
Video of some of his best moments from last season 

<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x374yg6?width=500&amp;hideInfos=1" width="500"></iframe>

407~~~
When Martial is fit again he will get back in the team. I only hope it's at the expense of Lingard and not Rashford. That of course is also contingent on Memphis keeping his form.

408~~~
I love the way he actually stays in his position and doesnt go hunting for the ball. It makes such a difference for the players around him to have the centre backs occupied high up and to know if they cross it someone is there.

We might be about to have three absolutely rapid, skilful forwards who between them have an average age of 20.

409~~~
I wish the same. Memphis, Rashford and Martial would be interesting to see, the only problem is that Martial would play as right winger which is not his best position. However, I prefer him there over Lingard. Also, I want to see Januzaj on the right wing and Pereira behind the striker. I hope LVG starts rotating them in the team.

410~~~
So good to see this and what a dream for the guy, really has taken his chance.

I still don't really know how good he is though.. yes he has scored 4 goals but they have all been kind of reaction finishes, 1 touch, right place right time and I know that is sometimes a skill you can't teach but it's still too early to judge - he hasn't exactly been prolific in our youth sides. I'm not trying to knock him at all, you can't ask for any more than he has given but let's not get too far ahead of ourselves - we've been in this position quite a few times recently with our youth products. I wonder how highly he is rated at the club, if Keane was fit and Wilson was at the club would he even have got his shot?

Anyway I'm just going to enjoy it while it's happening but not expecting the next Anelka etc like I'm reading <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> (maybe if he scores against Watford)

411~~~
When Martial comes back they need to play together

412~~~
-------------------------------RASHFORD-------------------------------

MARTIAL--------------JANUZAJ/ROONEY/MATA----------------DEPAY

------------HERRERA-------------------------SCHNEIDERLIN----------

SHAW------------JONES----------------SMALLING-----------DARMIAN

---------------------------------DE GEA----------------------------------

413~~~
That assist told me that he's 'arrived' and is no longer out of place in the first team squad. Could have easily tried to dribble and shoot, especially being on a hatrick.

414~~~
Hope the lad get's more opportunities. But again, if it's LVG or whoever comes in, will have to take a decision whether to invest in a striker in the summer or stick with Rashford, Martial, Wilson, Keane for the coming season. Too much of a risk it may seems. 

I think we still need a good striker with Martial and Rashford as back up.

415~~~
Get the 4-4-2 back and put Martial and Rashford upfront!! <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/><img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

416~~~
This. But so difficult to drop Mata in his current form.

417~~~
I know...that is why the cheeky smiley. Will Lingard be dropped?

Memphis - Rashford - Martial

                Mata

Keep that and rotate Memphis, Lingard and Rashford. 

Herrera along with Schneiderlin / Schweinsteiger / Carrick looks good and sharp.

418~~~
Rashford has no problem playing as a right winger if we need.In fact I don't even know what's his best position since he's a quite completed player.

419~~~
Probably been asked a few times already, but for those who have watched a lot of youth football, how do you think he compares to Wilson? I know Wilson was and still is really highly rated and he scored two goals in his debut as well, hasn't really had a good game since though. Not at all his fault necessarily, but Rashford does look like a player who can make an impact for us.

420~~~
I haven't seem either at youth level so I may be wrong but from what I observed Rashford is more physically ready. Wilson while a good player would never have won a physical battle with Gabriel or koscielny.

421~~~
Jones still exists? Depay as  RW?

422~~~
<a class="username" data-user="95131, @Obiorahking_" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/95131/">@Obiorahking_</a> looking like Ronaldinho there <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

423~~~
Yeah I'm 50/50 on Jones, maybe Blind to partner Smalling?

Depay as right wing so Martial can go LW where he has been playing well.

424~~~
I like him, he's going places. He's physically ready & has that bit of arrogant swagger to take on/run at defenders, doesn't always come off, but I like strikers that play like that.

425~~~
His play for the third goal was what really impressed me most, he held up the ball, waited for Herrera to arrive, then just rolled it into his path. That's first class decision making from a young player, he didn't rush it.

426~~~
That showed he has a good head on his shoulders. Though, where was the fecking defense? He had like 5 minutes inside the box to pick that pass. Shambolic defending.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

427~~~
I'm just walking around at work today, smiling, thinking about Rasher!

Next season nobody will remember Messi, Suarez and Neymar. All eyes will be on Martial, Memphis and Rashford. No pressure, though!

428~~~
Wow, did not see this coming. I remember reading his Name one or two times in the past but I have not been Aware of his potential.

I tell myself not to get carried away but exciting times seem to be ahead of us.

429~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

430~~~
Great two games and very promising, but Straight to the bench with him if Martial is fit and ready. Unless we play two strikers or Memphis moves to the right.

431~~~
I think hes more closer to Thomas Muller style, than anyone that has been mentioned..

432~~~
The exuberance of youth. The first thing in his mind seems to be running at, or in behind the defender. The free-kick he won, which was almost a pen, set the tone early on. I don't think Rooney even attemps that. That direct play, on top of the threat of running behind, gives the opposition problems. We've been missing it all season from a no.9.

Martial coming back & Memphis stepping up makes things interesting. Van Gaal has options all of a sudden. But I think having that pace and threat from our front man is vital.

433~~~
They are quite similar. Once Wilson is stronger then him, Keane and Rashford could be a fine trio at this club. All three strike the ball cleanly but obviously you need composure and a good mentality (and luck). Wilson would thrive in this team at the minute, because of the movement and energy. It also helps when you've friends who know your game in the team. Rashford is probably stronger but I think Wilsons played within himself either under instructions or whatever. It's early days. Both can do a job on the wing too, so they are good runners with the ball.

434~~~
looked great in the highlights I saw last night - when is rooney back by the way?  You know he will get straight back in which is a shame, you've looked much better without him!

435~~~
If the rumours are true regarding a knee op then maybe not this season.

436~~~
He already look matured, eye for pass,running behind the defenders or the attacking the space and some great finishes.
It should be 

-----------------Rashford-------------------
Depay-------------------------------Martial
-----------------Mata----------------------

Interchange between front three should be <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

437~~~
Didn't Martial look a bit iffy on the right recently? Forget who we were playing, but Depay came on, Martial moved right, and didn't look nearly as good.

438~~~
Depay/Martial both not that good compared to their left but again martial looks better in adopting to new role compared to Depay,plus the interchange of positions should help all three.

439~~~
I hope he progresses... but I cant help but remember Wilsons 2 goal debut, which reminded me of course of Macheda and his stunning start

Hopefully one of Wilson / Rashford makes a decent fist of it as its a while since we brought through a striker who made a big impact (unless you count Welbeck which as he didnt get that many opportunities up front for us I personally don't)

Anyway we have some good young prospects coming through our ranks and if we get a couple of first team calibre players and a couple of good squad options out of the current crop then  we will have done pretty good - hopefully Rashford can be one who makes it but I suspect there may be loan moves etc to come as he will need games to develop and with all players fit (and potentially another striker signed) his opportunities will be limited

440~~~
Good shout.

441~~~
He has done reasonably well thus far, I must say. He forgot to isolate and elevate the middle finger on his right hand as he headed in that second goal against Arsenal, but otherwise quite good.

442~~~
Whats amazing for me is that the guy hasn't really wasted many chances  as he has taken them.  He has maybe had 6-8 shots if that and come up with 4 goals. 

That is quality.

443~~~
Personally I can see him surpassing Shearer's total of Premier League goals quite easily unless he's extremely unlucky with injuries. Go Rasher!!!

444~~~
Great finisher but I'm not totally convinced that there is much more to his game. Could be our new Chicharito though, always great to have striker in the squad who is an excellent goal scorer.

445~~~
In 170 minutes, 18 year old Marcus Rashford has managed 24% of Wayne Rooney's goal total from the past 18 months.

Rooney has scored more than one goal in a game for United twice in the past year. Rashford did it with his first 2 shots in each of his first 2 games.

446~~~
That said ^ I find myself agreeing with this as an early assessment so far. Hopefully with more minutes and a settled period around the team, the other side of his game can develop.

447~~~
Yeah, he only scores goals. 

Jokes aside, I think he's already shown he's got qualities Rooney does not possess (momentarily or otherwise): pace, energy, hunger.

448~~~
Great pace and movement, he has the build to potentially bulk up and really bully defenders as well, since he's pretty tall, just really thin. Knows how to run with the ball and attack defenders too, though more of a lingard style rather then dribbling past them like Memphis/Martial. Definitely has potential to be a bit of a beastly striker, especially if he bulks up.

449~~~
Looking at the video on the previous page, and the play to set up the assist and near assist for Memphis I'd say he has a lot more to his game.

He seems to have a lot of tricks although I understand why he maybe hasn't utilised them considering it was his league debut

To perform like he did in the Europa league with no time to prepare ( as it seemed Martial would play) and in the League for an injury depleted side, struggling form, against one of the best teams in the League shows he has a good temperament too!

450~~~
Aside from his attacking contribution, his chasing down and hassling the Arsenal back four was top-notch. Could see he was absolutely shattered by the time he came off late on, but that's only a testament to how hard he worked during the whole game.

451~~~
What Utd is all about and why I follow this club. OT is not called the theatre of dreams for nothing. The lad just made watching Utd interesting again.

452~~~
Good Lord.

453~~~
His hold up play for the assist to Herrera suggests otherwise.

454~~~
Well, it's just basic math! Shearer played 559 league games, and Rashford is averaging 2 goals per league game, so he will score 1118 league goals if he gets a similar number of games!

<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

455~~~
He's nothing like Chica tbh. Considering he's got loads of pace, a wide skill set, has a good technique on him, the only thing he lacks which Chicarito has is that natural striker's instinct. The Goals that come of your knee, shoulder, what not.

456~~~
He was 15 when SAF retired......................<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

<span style="color: #ffffff">I'm feeling old</span>

457~~~
He needs his stats on his banner!

458~~~
He'll win the Ballon D'or before Martial will imo.

<a class="username" data-user="58513, @Sandikan" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/58513/">@Sandikan</a>

459~~~
Btw is it too far fetched to imagine the guy probably frequents or at least visits redcafe every now and then since he is a kid (they all go on the internetz right) and supports+plays for us? 

If I were him I'd be giddy reading all the praise and wankery about me on here.

460~~~
See Ventura below.

Great maths! It's certainly not beyond him to reach those kind of numbers judging by what he's shown so far. I think it's unfair to put that kind of pressure on him though, so expecting him to go much beyond a thousand league goals is probably a bit excessive at this point. Go Rasher!!

461~~~
probably tossing himself silly.

462~~~
As shit as our performance was, fair play to him for taking his chances.  Looks a good prospect, it is a shame when Mourinho takes over his future will probably lie at another club.

463~~~
Anyone see that article on MEN? Sorry haven't got the link but basically Rashfords previous coach expects him to exceed Welbeck due to his hunger for the ball.  Hope that's true!

464~~~
This season Cristiano played 9 big games (derbies) with Real against Barcelona, Atletico Madrid 2x, Bilbao, Sevilla, Valencia, Villareal and PSG 2x and didn't score single goal, not one!

Yet Rashford plays his first derby and scores 2 goals <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

468~~~
Haha class

469~~~
Has Welbeck ever scored back to back braces in senior football?

470~~~
I have my doubts.

471~~~
I know it has a lot of followers but thats a fake account

472~~~
I figured as much but posted it anyway for the comedic value.

473~~~
I know this is a proper hindsighty comment with no real value, but He has that "It" factor that i dont see in the likes of Wilson.

474~~~
That really is nonsense. No-one who's watched more of Wilson's career than his handful of glimpses of first team football would deny that he has an 'It' factor - I've lost count of the number of sides he savaged for the U21s, the number of four- or five-goal games, the number of wondergoals both for United youth sides and loan teams - and he put on just as special a performance for his senior debut as Rashford's, also scoring a brace, in a team playing much worse. Ok, he didn't score another double in his next game, but that seems a pretty high bar! There's no denying that he's never enjoyed the same youth-friendly atmosphere that Rashford has stepped into. If he hadn't been on loan (and still sick, I think?) then he'd have been the one reaping the rewards of Memphis tearing Midtjylland to pieces. There's absolutely no question he'd have put away those same straightforward chances.

They're both special players, both the star strikers of their age groups throughout their youth careers, and both have the talent to potentially stick with United and do great things. For Rashford to do what he's done so incredibly early in his career is astonishing. I hate that the response on here to one United player doing well is always to spuriously criticise another.

475~~~
i havent followed his youth career, as i just dont have the time to watch u21 football, so if he's shown something special there then fair enough. of what ive seen of both players in first team senior football however, i just see something more all rounded and promising in Rashfords game.

476~~~
Yep, your assessment is spot on once again. Wilson was phenomenal for the u21 and u19 in the Champions League. At times he was a one man attack and absolutely clinical on the big occasion. However,to be fair, Rashford seems more suited to a lone striker role with his stronger hold up play, better first touch and I think he's a naturally better tackler than Wilson (although Wilson's pressing is fantastic). I feel Wilson needs to play with a partner in first team football if he is to play as a striker. I'd love to see Wilson get time as an inside right though, hugging the line. He's probably the quickest player in the attack, with ridiculous acceleration and we've seen him score great strikers from distance and a few nice mazy dribbles from his time in the academy. He certainly gives a different option than Lingard, Adnan,Mata or Pereira out wide. While we have the next Pele and Henry, a Jairzinho type player would complement them nicely! <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

477~~~
To be honest I think in the heat of the Rashford excitement you're just forgetting what Wilson was like in his handful of first team outings. Check out this video, it's exclusively footage from his senior games in 2014/15. There are four or five moments in there better than anything Rashford has shown so far, and for a team playing worse than our last two performances and in an atmosphere much less conducive to giving youngsters their chances.


The hold up play at 0:41
The pass at 1:20
The run at 1:43
The attack at 2:13
The goal at 2:50
And the dozen or so times he burns straight past multiple opponents as if they aren't there.

I'll stop now as this is getting OT. As I say, I just don't like it when we use one United player's success as a stick to beat another with, often undeservedly.

478~~~
Not a bad shout at all. Although I have to differ about Rashford's hold-up play - he didn't even bother trying against Arsenal, and understandably since he's still incredibly lightweight and didn't have a hope of competing physically with Arsenal's CBs. But obviously that's all down to his age, and he'll fill out and be able to hold his own in those situations. Wilson's hold-up play isn't a strength, but it is a bit underrated because of the trying circumstances he was often playing in last season. Check out 0:41 in the video above, he takes a howitzer of an aerial ball on his chest while being shoved in the back and harried from the side and still manages to lay it off to Fellaini.

479~~~
At least from the two games, he is not Bambi on ice.  Pretty ice cool in his finishing

480~~~
He's only 18 now for feck's sake lol

I think 1 of Wilson's biggest problems and why he has looked quiet in a lot of his first team games is that he was always far too good for whatever level he played at in youth football so got a bit used to being able to pick and choose his moments of when to actually show his talent. He could be invisible for most of a game and then beat half the team with a run or just decide to take over and end up with a hat trick. He hasn't really gotten used to having to work for goals or involve himself more in general play to work himself into games. He hasn't played a huge amount for Brighton but the few times I've seen him he looks to be trying to get more involved in general play and trying to link more with his team mates which is encouraging. If he could just get over his injury and illness problems and actually get a run of games he has the ability to have a brilliant career

484~~~
Spot on, just turned 20 two months ago and people are acting like his career is over. 

I still remember that match against City where we were losing and he just decided to score 4 goals. He was literally unstoppable at times for the youth teams. He has got all the talent, he just needs the senior experience. He has looked impressive every time I've watched Brighton even if he isn't scoring. I just hope he can get over the injuries.

485~~~
From that clip I forgot how quick Wilson is.  Let's just hope he can stay injury free and get some minutes to build on.  How fantastic would it be to have these two coming through to the first team.

486~~~
When's his testimonial?

487~~~
Rashford and Welbecks former trainer:

<b><i>"Marcus has far more pace than Danny ever had"</i></b>
I like the sound of that but it really sounds ridiculous. Far more? Talking Bolt-level here.

488~~~
Well, pace works in fine margins and if you were a second faster over 100 metres for example, you would be significantly faster than someone else

489~~~
I would certainly say so. 

He kept up with Bellerin in a straight line and nearly blasted passed Koscielny on the outside - that alone surprises me massively as I didn't realise he had that sort of pace.

490~~~
Well yeah, but Welbeck is very very fast, especially over distance. I'm not buying it. If Rashers is faster it must be marginal.

491~~~
Watching his interview with Carrick, I was surprised how short he was. Out on the field I thought he was 6'1" or so, but Carrick was a good couple of inches taller so Rashford must only be 5'10" or at most 5'11".

492~~~
Carrick probably still had his boots on

493~~~
Looks about six feet next to carrick's 6-2

494~~~
Isn't Carrick only 6'1"?

Hmm, just looked up his stats and you're right. Apparently he's 6'2". Which yeah, does add an extra inch on to Rashford's height so he's getting closer to the 6 foot mark. Still not as tall as I thought, but not the 'shortarse' that I thought at being 5'10". <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

495~~~
Discussion of Rashford on the RedCafe Podcast: <a class="externalLink" href="https://audioboom.com/boos/4244623-united-hour-e19-marcus-rashford" target="_blank">https://audioboom.com/boos/4244623-united-hour-e19-marcus-rashford</a>

496~~~
Yep, that's a really good point. I really became aware of him when he came into that U18 side featuring Daehli, Januzaj, Pearson, Rothwell et al and I've never really seen him make his job look anything other than completely effortless. Then again, I actually thought at times in his stop-start first-team outings he was giving the same impression. I mean, he was failing to score at a time when Rooney, Van Persie, Falcao and Di Maria were also failing to score, but he was also running past defenders for fun once every five minutes. I found it kind of staggering how underwhelmed people on here were just because he didn't score enough goals. For all that Rashford, for comparison, has done remarkably well, three out of four of his actual goals were must-score chances, scarcely more than tap-ins. Wilson did things that only a very gifted player can do, let alone an eighteen or nineteen year old, whatever he was at that age. And he'd have had a hatful of assists if Rooney, Fellaini and Falcao (these just off the top of my head) had put in some very simple chances he created for them.

So while I agree that effectively finding things difficult for the first time ever at first team level <i>could</i> be a problem for him, I don't think it actually has been yet, necessarily. His problem was that he was playing in a struggling team for odd half-games here and there, and at a time when fans had little patience for youngsters getting run-outs, and just wanted to see expensive stars like RVP, Falcao and Di Maria doing what they were paid to do.

497~~~

498~~~
Looks like I'm one of the few that doesn't agree withe playing him out wide right just to accomodate Martial. The most impressive part of his game has been his predatory instinct in and around the 6 yard box, so for me if he plays then it has to be as the striker. Otherwise we'll get caught in the trap that England do where we field our best individuals rather than the best team.

500~~~
He's had 0 presence upfront tonight.

501~~~
I didnt think he offered much against Arsenal either. Looks tired today and it is understandable. Hes still learning. I would take him off for Lingard and Martial up front.

502~~~
He's looking like the right sided version of Martial. Basically you should buy a new Striker.

503~~~
Doing brilliantly down the right, love his direct, quick runs.

504~~~
Much better on the right than Martial was.

505~~~
As soon as we managed to get him the ball he's caused trouble. Best player in the second half, did more on the right in few minutes than Martial did all night.

506~~~
Yeah as I criticise him, hes been brilliant since the move to the right.

507~~~
Exciting talent, wow.

508~~~
Maybe, but I would give him a bit more of time.

509~~~
He's bloody blitz.

510~~~
Should be a starter when everyone's fit, Rooney, Martial, Lingard, Rashford. Have had enough from Mata, Memphis still needs a bit of work.

511~~~
Best player on the pitch bar possibly De Gea for me. Worked his ass off even when he didn't have much to feed on from the support around him. Looked good almost everytime he got himself onto the ball and constantly threatening. His work rate is fantastic.

512~~~
He's a menace, I like him.

513~~~
Very good on the right tonight! That's a position that should be very much up for grabs as well, so hopefully he'll keep getting chances. I thought he worked very hard centrally as well. Even if there wasn't a lot happening, he kept turning up and making himself a nuisance, so all in all one of our better players tonight as far as I'm concerned.

514~~~
spot the one that doesn't belong: lingard.

515~~~
Martial up front and Rashford on the right.

516~~~
Difficult game to judge him on, there was so little supply and chances for him but he lifted the team when he was on the right.

517~~~
anyway, some nice bright play from him at times... somewhat subdued. can't help but wonder how tired he is from football, homework, perhaps getting trouble with his parents, etc. there's a lot to deal with when you're 18.

518~~~
Lingard has been our most productive olayer for the past like 8 matches, I'd keep him yeah.

519~~~
Looked very good on the right. He's fast as feck.

520~~~
A lot better on the right for me. He's got bags of pace.

521~~~
It worked out great with him on the right. Exciting talent.

522~~~
Impressive again. Looked our most potent attacking threat.

523~~~
Looked exciting even on a quite night.

524~~~
Wonderkid.

525~~~
Too much of a small sample size to make a judgement but two things that stand out: Pace and finishing. He's really fast.

526~~~
Great to see defenders back off him and giving him so much respect. Clearly he has got the ability to beat his man.

527~~~
Showed that he also has potential wide right.  Played as well as he could given the service and opportunities he had.  He is so fast - imagine what he'll be like once he has filled out.  Looking like quite some talent

528~~~
Expectations that he's going to score every game can ease down a bit now, but a promising performance.

Possibly time to take him out of the starting lineup now. That was 3 starts in a week! Maybe Lingard's greater defensive nous will be what's needed against the Brom.

529~~~
The kid is pure gold, pretty sure of that.

530~~~
The pace might reduce if he fills out, but for now he looks really promising.

531~~~
At least he's another option for Louis van Gaal even off the bench and throw Adnan in there and the fact Rooney still has a brace on, it's up to the manager to make the right call, we need to get a front four that can gel and we have a genuine chance at top four with two good cup runs.

532~~~
Lukaku Martial and Rashford as a front-three being fed by Mata. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

533~~~
Well that's that settled on where everyone needs to play then.

534~~~
Reminiscent of a young Martial.

535~~~
When he gets his man strength he will be a beast. The Martial comparisons are apt.

536~~~
One of our best players, again.

537~~~
I thought he had some good lay-offs while playing as the #9 tonight, it was jsut we were shit in attack in the first half and he stuck to his position like LvG likes so saw little of the ball. He was superb in the second half on the RW and menaced their fullback, it was him that sparked us into life IMO.

538~~~
I liked that performance, you saw more of what he can do when he moved to the right wing.

539~~~
Showed his great link-up play up front and then showed his pace, quick thinking and great technique on the right. Amazing talent and it's good to know that he could be used on the wing as well. 

Still, I'd like to see him continue up front with maybe trying Memphis on the right.

540~~~
Cracking player. Looks a real gem.

Some of his little one touch passes were lovely. Great feet and pace dribbling.

541~~~
Very very bright

542~~~
Watford seemed to have problems playing against him, even having more than one player mark him at times.

543~~~
Looked class when he moved out to the right. The few times he got the ball up top he looked bright as well, but we didn't really do much attacking for the most part so he wasn't as involved as the last few games. But was by far our most dangerous player IMO. Should keep his place on the right wing if he's not too tired for the next game.

544~~~
How did it take Martial, Rooney and Will Keane getting injured for him to get his chance?

It makes me wonder who else we have in the academy with talent who isn't getting used

I think tonight was his best game despite him not scoring

545~~~
His poaching abilities can guarantee him some gametime even if he doesnt grow up that fast as footballer which is great.. I dont say he's better than Chicharito now but he certainly looks to have more talent and for that reason I am glad this young fella has got his chance and has been taking them, excited to see more of him till the end of the season.

It's great that it's not only Martial who can dribble past players in similar fashion. He's also very aware of what is around him, some nice little flicks and quick one two's like they all do it for U21/U18s. The best moment was probably how he controlled that driven pass at the right hand side and went past that player, so classy, really like him and he's ours!

546~~~
Rashford right, Martial Left, Kane up top <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

547~~~
Showed he can do much more than just bang goals into the back of the net. Did very well leading the line today. his pressing was first class

548~~~
That's what I think separates him from the ''flash in the pan youngster'' route. He's clearly a huge talent when you see him on and off the ball, never mind the goals he's scored so far.

549~~~
Looked a different player on the right, showed a different side of him. He's fearless, always willing to take players on, showed great skill. Great to have kids like him in the team.

550~~~
Best performance so far. Kid looks better with each viewing.

551~~~

552~~~
I had forgotten what it was like to have a good right winger in the side. He looked very sharp when the change was made with him and Martial.

553~~~
He is direct. Takes on players, good awareness and anticipation. Not selfish. He will improve his decision making. We have gold on our hands.

554~~~
Love seeing him on the right last night in the 2nd half. Very strong and direct play that we have been missing all season.

Memphis - Martial - Rashford is the future.

555~~~
Few posters on here were saying how he's similar to Hernandez the other day, in that he's a good poacher but hasn't showed great technical ability.

I think he murdered that theory yesterday. Great runs from out wide. Its great having an effective right winger.

556~~~
100% deserved. Absolutely delighted for the kid, he's made such an impact. 

Played very well last night on the right, was terrorizing Watford's back four. Great to see, and long may it continue.

557~~~
Lingards woeful at defending.

558~~~
Harsh on Memphis, I think he has great potential.

559~~~
It's a bit premature right now, but if Rashford keeps his form up, could he make a late surge for the England Euro squad?

560~~~
2 more goals and he's on the list after 4 games.

561~~~
He has a chance if he keeps this form up, but I hope he doesn't make the England squad. It would be too soon for him and it could harm his development. 

The media hype would go into over drive, like they did with Theo and look what happened there. I would rather he get a rest and proper pre-season instead.

562~~~
Best thing about last night is that he showed he can play on the right. We can start all our best attacking players if he plays on the right. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

His pace is insane, surely the fastest player in our squad.

563~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35722783" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/35722783</a>

This is ridiculous!

564~~~
The ridiculous part is that the press asked him about it. Hodgson just said he won't rule him in or out, and I think it would be pretty weird for the national manager to announce that a player has no chance of making it. That doesn't mean he has a good chance to be selected either. He just gave the only answer he could there.

565~~~
--------------------------------MARTIAL-------------------------------

MEMPHIS---------------------JANUZAJ--------------------RASHFORD

Potential future frontline?

566~~~
He went on to further say that pressure shouldn't be put on a player, etc. 

He's not making the squad. In any case, it's the most solid group of English strikers in a long time. Vardy, Kane, Rooney and Welbeck. No place for Rashford in there.

567~~~
He's already better at linking play with his back to goal than Chicharito was. Tidy with short flicks to anyone running near him. 

I don't think he'll be a right winger. Players like him don't really play there anymore. 

I can't really think of a really effective attacker in Europe who is at their best on the same wing as their strong foot. It seems to be obsolete. Nobody at Barca, Bayern or Real does it. Bellarabi plays on the right normally, but maybe he'd be even better on the left cutting in. And he's more good than great. Atletico use Koke on the right but he'd basically just a playmaker standing out wide like Milan or Madrid Beckham (young, faster Beckham was more a normal winger). 

If Rashford keeps looking this good, I think it'll be Martial, Memphis and Rashford as the 3 players we need covering the 9 and LW positions and we will still need to sign a left-footed to play on the right like Bale, Griezmann or Mahrez. And Januzaj (also a 10 option) and Lingard will be fighting to win the spot as that player's backup.

568~~~
Douglas Costa plays LW while being left-footed. Griezmann was mainly used as a Left winger for Real Sociedad.

Don't know about Rashford, too early to make a decision about best position imo, although he seems great at sniffing out chances in the box.

569~~~
I'd note that Griezmann has improved since moving centrally and that we don't really know yet how he would do if given extend time on the right. 

Costa is doing well on the left, it's true. I think he's the type of tiny, quick player who could maybe play almost or as effectively on his same side wing. Someone like Navas was effective doing so at Sevilla. If you're not going to be a real threat to cut in and score, then sure.

But there's a reason Neymar is on the left, Messi on the right, Robben on the right and Ribery was on the left before injuries got him, Ronaldo and Bale the same and Hazard and Sanchez have become left-wingers. It just seems to work better. 

I basically agree with your 2nd paragraph, though. Way too early to say about Rashford (and probably Martial too. Only Memphis looks fixed at LW). But I'd rank RW as likely to be his 3rd best position behind 9 and LW in some order, based on what I've seen, his physical profile (not short and his pace seems relatively better over long distances rather than over short ones, unlike someone like Pereira who is quick over 3-5 yards but not over 15-20) and trends in football.

We need players to rotate anyways. Martial, Memphis and Rashford covering 2 spots (LW and 9) would be more than enough games for all 3, considering we'll be back in Europe next year (if only on Thursdays).

570~~~
Against U21's?
Talk to me when he does something like that against 1st team opposition.

571~~~
I wasn't being serious as the green smiley and the Ronaldinho reference clearly smuggested.

572~~~
Everything is genuinely stacked up in his favour to be a hero/legend and potential captain at United.

Not wanting to go overboard but just pointing out all the factors are there.

Fantastic Ability.
Attacking Flair.
Youngster.
Came through the academy.
Local lad.
Fan of Manchester United.

It's all there for him to be a legend at this club.... go and take it...

573~~~
He looks so awkward trying to take people on on the right hand side.

574~~~
I'd sub him at half time. Hold-up play's not his strength and that's what we need at the moment. Time for Memphis.

575~~~
Agreed.

576~~~
That's one way to destroy his confidence. Look at Memphis after he kept getting subbed. He should get a bit more time, he is dangerous with his dribbling. Just not seeing enough of the ball.

577~~~
Invisible while he was up front. When he was first moved out to the right he had a nice 5 minute period but then has been quiet again since then.

Give him another 10 minutes or so then if nothing much is happening for him bring on Memphis.

578~~~
Keeping him on when he's seeing so little of the ball and is required to do things he's not so great at (aerial play, hold-up play, defending) does nothing to boost his confidence.

579~~~
Shit service.

580~~~
Dribbling? He looks so awkward when he is trying to take players on. He can make some smart fakes here and there but I wouldn't consider dribbling one of his fortes.

581~~~
His first touch has looked terrible

582~~~
He needs to come off the field. He is such a waste of space out there on the right.

583~~~
Really poor today but this is to be expected with such a young player.

584~~~
Looked lost when we didn't have the ball and looked physically disjointed having to play so slow when we did have it.

585~~~
Think it's time to take him out of the team. Great talent but it's time to take a step back with him.

586~~~
Mata going off ruined his game, he needed his supply.

587~~~
He should have been taken off immediately on Mata's sending off. In fact, he should not have started the game. He was pretty ineffective against Watford and likewise today even when we had 11 players on the pitch.

588~~~
I think most of us knew his period of being effective in the side wouldn't last long. It was simply a 'Macheda' moment(s).

That's not to say he will follow the Macheda route or saying he isn't talented, its just that he's not ready for this level yet imo. Once the surprise element wears off being a centre forward in the premier league let alone Manchester United is an extremely tall order especially as an 18yo.

He should continue his development in the reserves and have a championship loan next season.

589~~~
He was poor, but to be fair to the kid, he's played 4 games in 10 days.

590~~~
Messi wouldn't even score in this team.

Rashford would have buried the chance Rondon had for his goal, but you need to actually supply your strikers if you expect them to score.

591~~~
I second this. It is time to return to reality and send him back down.

592~~~
Needs to go to the bench and start getting 30 minutes here and there. Hes too far along to go back to the reserves but he cant be expected to lead the line every week at his age.

593~~~
He has played 4 games, he isn't even close to being too far along to go back to reserves. He has done absolutely nothing at reserve level yet and has loads to learn which he can do in the u21s. There are better and more developed players in ours and other clubs u21s.

594~~~
Not a game for him.He couldn't yet to take the game by his own in a disjointed attack especially when you play with 10 men.

595~~~
Forget the hype and a couple games with goals.  Yes, he is young and has a lot to learn, but let's be honest...he didn't even participate in the game today.  This is professional sports and if you make that stage you have to be judged fairly.

596~~~
you cant really judge him by this game. I think he will still be confident enough to start next game . if he fails to impress next game when we actually play with 11 men than bench him..

597~~~
It doesn't matter how old he is or how far along he is, if hes good enough he is good enough. He's played 4 games and been good in 3 of them. He deserves to stay in the 1st team for a while yet.

598~~~
Memphis for him as soon as Mata was sent off or even at HT must have been one of the most obvious substitutions in the history of mankind.

599~~~
I can only hope that he doesn't play long enough under Van Gaal for him to ruin him... either by overplaying him, ruining his confidence or making him regress as a footballer.

600~~~
I never said how old he is and how far along he is, is very important as he isn't good enough yet and he can still learn a lot from u21 football. He was hardly involved against Watford or WBA. Just like every other talented young player he can play for the u21s and be involved with the first team.

601~~~
He was our best attacking player vs Watford.

Dunno, what some people are talking about.

602~~~
Mata was easily better in the second half. Rashford hardly touched the ball up front and did some good dribbles when pushed out right. Nothing to put him above ever playing for the u21s again.

603~~~
What do we think, back to the bench vs Liverpool?

604~~~
I hope not. Just seen we have a card happy ref for the match so would be great to see him, Martial and Memphis running at their back line all match.

605~~~
Where's the ref from?

606~~~
Liverpool game for a local lad and United fan is the perfect game.

607~~~
Big game for the kid, he's clearly got the trust of the management. Let's keep our fingers crossed he can find the net again.

608~~~
Did nothing wrong in his co-fullback role, even made a couple of decent tackles.

609~~~
Yeah I think he may have a future in that outer right back position, if that's something we decide to pursue further in the coming years.

610~~~
Remember when he got thrust into the team against Midgetland. And then 2 days later played Arsenal and it was said we had no training. And how he played up top, scored 4 goals and was on fire.

Then he got training, sorta the Memphis/Martial treatment and since then has been shifted around and been less effective for us? 

Yeah that...

611~~~
Literally came in to write that.

"<i>No Marcus, we can't be having any of that malarkey. Possession is where it's at</i>"

the new Valencia <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

615~~~
Other than Martial he looks the only one that might make something happen IMO.

616~~~
He's done OK. About as much as you can reasonably expect from him. Problem is, as <a class="username" data-user="48107, @Devil may care" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48107/">@Devil may care</a> highlights, that's just about all we've got in this team.

617~~~
He actually stands in the penalty box, unlike Rooney. Problem is hes the only one there and has two defenders glued to him.

618~~~
He's got good movement but should be making appearances from the bench

He was brought in under desperate circumstances due to injuries but van Gaal thinks he's uncovered a gem and will keep playing him whilst ebbing away his confidence

619~~~
Thought he was unlucky to come off especially for that clown Depay.

620~~~
Judging by how Memphis and other did he should still start the next game tbf.

621~~~
You're saying that just because of his age and nothing else. He was good again today and much better than Martial IMO.

622~~~
I thought he looked lively, though a couple of careless moments. Sometimes he drifts too far wide, giving us no central threat. Apart from that, good performance really.

623~~~
Agreed, he was sharp and lively, that little lift touch and turn in the box was class, can't ask for much more than we are getting from an 18 year old with half a dozen senior games to his name.

624~~~
Thought he was good today. Needed to be taken off as he we have an important game midweek and another game a few days later.

625~~~
I like his movement and willingness to play for the team but if he's playing as a forward, he should maybe have more of a threat himself. 

There was a couple of lay offs, which in some he did well and some he under-hit. Sometimes you can refuse the one-two and take a touch to steady yourself and take a shot/shift it aside and see what the next moment could be i.e dribble into a more direct offensive area or lay off an even better ball (e.g a shot from the centre of the penalty area).

A talent and we should play him. Just hope he doesn't get philosophised.

626~~~
well he wasn't getting on the ball much so it is natural for a player like him to drift wider especially when he can make space for Martial to go in for him, I have no problems with this kind of play, it's actually small piece of fluidity we can see in our game these days

627~~~
He's looked the real deal to me. The goals obviously weren't gonna keep coming at that rate, but he does good things pretty much every time he gets the ball, not unlike Martial.

628~~~
I didn't want him to start as I'm worried about burning him out with all these games in a row and he's looked tired in the last couple. However he did well enough that I was quite unhappy that it was him being taken off for Memphis (should have been Lingard, with Rashford moving over to the right).

629~~~
Yeah there's nothing like being picked to start for one of the biggest clubs in the world at 18 to ebb away someone's confidence

630~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

631~~~
He''s done fairly well again today.

Even barged off Andy Carroll off the ball once. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

632~~~
He's going to make it here I reckon. I think he's got enough tools in his locker to be a top player.

633~~~
would be interesting to see how he develops, would still be hesitant to judge on how high his potential is, if he's at least overall Welbeck level than great but something tells me he can be better, hopefully he will work hard over summer to cement his place in the team for the next season.

634~~~
Will still not understand why he started on the right in the last game. Its just insane when his movement in the box is great. 

Id like to see him be allowed to take free kicks given how shocking the seniors are at it.

635~~~
Thought he had a good game today. Although I don't want people to put expectations on him. I still think he's 2-3 years away from claiming a legitimate spot. He scored those goals in his first 2 games, but I don't see it continuing.

636~~~
well the number of chances we created for him is nearly zero

637~~~
I like him play upfront not on the right. Still raw but a talented player for sure.

638~~~
You can tell when he plays that he's only 18 and isn't as far in his development as someone like Martial for instance. He has the confidence to take on and go past players but isn't quite there in terms of current ability for it to always work. Looks promising though.

639~~~
There's a quote from Scholes (in the Scholes as pundit thread) saying that he takes them like Ronaldo.

Which I'm guessing means he misses most of them.

641~~~
Youll know hes a first teamer when he takes a free kick and it hits the wall or goes for a throw in.

642~~~
I was pleased with him, he didn't shrink and took the game on and created a couple of decent openings and a chance for Fellaini, can't ask more than that.

643~~~
This kid will be class..

644~~~
Fastest player in the squad? Amazing turn of pace and runs so well with the ball. Could well be a true gem this one.

645~~~
Like Martial, one of our only threats. Looks like he'll be a star.

646~~~
The senior players completely let him down today.

647~~~
Didn't really happen for him tonight but starting to think he could be a real gem. Very positive and direct with his running. He and Martial could be a real handful when both are at it.

648~~~
Its a shame we create nothing. Kid is getting little to no help from most of the team.. 
He looks like he belongs.. which is a good thing.

649~~~
If he puts on some muscle, and doesn't lose his pace, he'll be something special.

650~~~
a glimpse of promise. hard to believe him and martial are 18 and 20. martial obviously much further developed but when compared to direct peers rashford looks fantastic.

651~~~
I like how himself and Martial are starting to link up with each other and look for each other. It didn't come off tonight but there were some promising signs. Crazy to think that he was still playing for the u18s on the 13th of February.

652~~~
its the one thing thats kept me from total despair tonight. they could be developed into a fantastic pair over the next 2-3 years

653~~~
No way he should be playing 6-7 games in a row for the first team at this stage, he needs easing in, impact sub and all that, but lack of options leaves LvG no choice, and some would have you believe this is a good thing.

654~~~
He has the physical gifts you need to be a Premier League player. He has enough pace to go past much stronger players. He will fill out a bit too!

655~~~
It is a very good thing. Maureen might get another couple of quid for him in the summer off the back of these performances.

656~~~
I like this lad, positive player.
Will Mourinho give him game time?

657~~~
Early days but I can't remember an attacking player we've brought through the academy that looks as good as this kid (not counting the foreign imports like Rossi etc)

658~~~
if we dont count Welbeck than the last one could be Ryan Giggs IIRC

659~~~
He has balls. 

Head up and takes people on. 

Deserves to keep his place until the end of the season.

Next manager has a couple of diamonds to work with at least, mostly rough diamonds but it's something.

660~~~
I see no reason for him to be dropped.

661~~~
Showed good quality playing on the shoulder and excellent dribbling from wide. Fantastic signs that he can develop to a very good level as he has a lot of good sides to his game.

662~~~
Seemed to be the only man on the pitch aware that we had to try and score lots goals in this game of football.

663~~~
This kid can play. And the best thing about it is it's a trial by fire. Holding his own too.

664~~~
These last few seasons we have had some fantastic youths come through or come to the club that could be the real future and a successful future, now we just need a manager to believe in them...

Rashford, Martial, Januzaj, Depay, Shaw, Pereira etc

And many that we have had for a little while which could go on to be part of that like..

De Gea, Herrera, Smalling etc

We really just need a manager to believe in them and play them how they should be.

665~~~
Played the second half right wing. rofl. We needed goals and instead of getting him help up front, LVG pushes him out wide...

I like him and I hope he has a future with us.

666~~~
I don't think I have ever seen a United player run that fast with the ball without losing control of it. I mean ever! Phenomenal ball control at break neck speed. Him and Martial have such a brilliant understanding too. They always look for each other. He's not physically fit to play 90 mins yet though (What would you expect for a player who jumps from U18s to First Team) and I would like to give him maybe 60 mins in the next game against City just to give him a breather. Genuinely love his style of play.

667~~~
He is going to be the business. Great touch. 

Bit jelly.

668~~~
He was great last night. Very impressed with him. His speed is amazing; the way he just breezed past Sakho at one point.

669~~~
Yeah, did it first half and the 2nd passed Milner? he is bloody fast. Just needs to learn how to get into the game more but that'll come with age.

670~~~
His first touch could set him apart.

A killer first touch and tons of pace. Very exciting prospect

671~~~
Such a promising talent!

Any records of how fast he is - records from school track or similar?

672~~~
One thing I'm a big fan of in this lad (and Lingard too tbf to him) is that even though he's usually tussling with players who are bigger, more experienced and more well developed than him, he's fecking good at just henching them out using shoulder, hip, timing or whatever. Was beautiful to see him smashing Clyne all over the place last night, and that one on Andy Carroll the other week was a masterpiece.

673~~~
Who do you support?

674~~~
I thought that was his best match since Arsenal. Many reasons to believe this kid is the real deal.

675~~~
I don't remember Welbeck ever looking as good as Rashford does

676~~~
Liverpool.

677~~~
You just said you support Liverpool, no taking that back now.

678~~~
feck!

679~~~
Cheers, wasn't sure.

680~~~
I completely agree. Van Gaal doesn't really have a rotation policy and Marcus Rashford has played like an 18 year old thrown in the deep end. Plenty of admirable promise, a lot of genuine ability but still like an 18 year old who is not the full package yet and is still a few years from being fully ready. I'm not going to try to convince other fans that I don't think this situation is a good thing for his develpment because he has been yet another bright spot in a bit of a mess of a season but what do we do with him next year?

I don't think he's really ready to be the fourth choice backup/youth striker and we already have James Wilson coming back. We can't really go into next season with Rooney, Martial, Wilson and Rashford as the four strikers either. Another top forward to support Rooney's status has to be the first port of call next season. Martial looks more at home on the left side of attack and if there is no extra bodies brought in up front then we realistically risk throwing Rashford in again.

I dunno, this situation in terms of man management looks a bit sticky. I would much rather him getting League Cup, FA cup responsibilities and getting minutes at the end of games but in truth James Wilson is the one that is next in line for that. The only logical thing I can really see is Rashford heading back to the academy to play or going out on a loan.

I agree with <a class="username" data-user="85484, @C'est Moi Cantona" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/85484/">@C'est Moi Cantona</a>  that it is not a very good thing at all. It is way to early for a player with his rawness to be playing games as a first choice striker without a legitimate reason other than "there is nobody else". Also, who? Maureen?...

681~~~
Who give a feck about the reason? He is getting to play first team football which is good for his development.

682~~~
lets not get overexcited, welbeck looked really good prospect as well, rashford is just one bright spark in the dark times so everybody's wowed now. Lets wait and let the guy develop to further judge him.. but yeah I agree he looks really promising, I wonder how many players from the academy would make it simply if they were given chance as Rashford looked really great but nothing extraordinary tbh (some might disagree though) but given chance he took it and it already looks like it helped him a lot and he's getting better game by game. I don't think that we got great talents jsut now we always had them but not all of them got chances. I personally thought that Robbie brady could be a decent player for us if given chances but yeah he turned out as injury prone so one never knows

683~~~
Didn't Welbeck score 4 goals for Arsenal last year? Rashford scored that in his first 2 games.

That's not to say I don't rate Welbeck, he's a fantastic player but he's Bambi on ice in the box unfortunately.

684~~~
Welbz is great player, the problem here was/is that too many people saw him as no9 striker which he isn't even himself, can be great wide forward, sort of what Martial is for us.. not as much pressure for him to score from there and defo good enough goalscorer from that role, not talking about all other things he brings to the team which alone make him valuable player..

685~~~
Brady isn't injury prone. He's only had the one injury in 13/14 and played 30+ times in every other season only missing out on matchday squads a few times.

686~~~
Lionel who?

687~~~
So much more impressive than the likes of Wilson or Keane. This guy's the real deal

688~~~
What a player. Stunning goal.

689~~~
I agree. Rashford seems to have the X-factor.

690~~~
The next Michael Owen? That pace..

691~~~
Clearly doesn't care at all about the fact that he's playing against some of the best players in th world. Three goals and an assist in total against Arsenal and City. For every Ronaldo or Messi there's a dozen Machedas, but Rashford seems like a proper player.

692~~~
Been excellent so far. Nice goal, and should've gotten us a penalty too. Will be incredibly pissed off if he's taken out of the team for Rooney.

693~~~
Hes only gone and scored again. Absolute mad bastard he is.

694~~~
Should of had a penalty too. Playing very well.

695~~~
I'd rather Welbeck. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

696~~~
Black Ice II.

697~~~
So far, so very good. Kid's electric.

698~~~
About time he scored. Feels like ages since he last contributed.

<span style="color: #ffffff">I jest.</span>

699~~~
I agree, I never really understood those that wanted Wilson in the side as he's clearly not a PL player let alone a Man Utd player. 

Rashford though... Like I said I can't remember an attacking player the academy has produced that looks as good as him (since the class of 92 obvs)

700~~~
Can't expect more from a young striker.  Both him and Martial should be a part of our future for years to come.  Martial was keeping us watching games so far,  now there are 2!  

I just hope he isn't relegated to the bench when you-know-who is back.

701~~~
Wilson was banging them for the U21s with just as much electric pace and dribbling ability as Rashford is showing. His shortcomings have mainly been due to his own propensity to niggling injuries. Rashford has and does look a phenomenal talent, but let's not incorrectly dismiss Wilson during the praise.

702~~~
It's horrible playing against somebody this quick. Serious pace can make you look so stupid

703~~~
The commentator was mentioning that the City Academy players were talking about him 6 weeks back.  He started as a striker in an u-19 games, and was moved to CB because of a red card (and no more subs).  Played there 30 mins and didn't look out of place.  Wondering if that's true? Anyone has insight.

704~~~
The guy plays smart and direct. I like it.

705~~~
GOAT

706~~~
He has also never been given 8(?) starts in a row like Rashford. I don't understand the need to try write off Willo to try praise Rashford.

707~~~
don't worry, he won't get a game if Mourinho comes in..

708~~~
We have Martial and the new Martial on our hands <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

709~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

710~~~
First off its u18s, there is no u19s in England and no, he was moved to CM. The commentator is a fecking idiot, I can't think of his name but he is regularly an idiot.

711~~~
PACE. He has all of it.

712~~~
Agreed. Don't think Wilson has the self confidence and toughness of Rashford though which is another reason he hasn't stood out yet. IMO he's more talented though if anything. Still, the mentality can be the difference at first team level, I'm glad Wilson is learning in the championship, should toughen him up.

713~~~
Love the guy.

714~~~
Fair enough

715~~~
He really doesn't look out of place, I love how direct he is.

716~~~
He's definitely not another Macheda, that is much is certain.

717~~~
He's already much better than Lingard for me, so it is Jesse who should be shown the door when Mourinho comes in, not Rashford as people are fearing on here.

718~~~
I thought he was absolutely fantastic today. Even when he lost possession he was attempting to make something happen. Admittedly Demichelis is the ideal opponent and life was far more difficult once Fernandinho switched to playing centre defence.

719~~~
Rashford has also been played during some of our best performances with Martial and Mata and Memphis had some good games during that time as well. Meanwhile Wilson played during our worst times playing 3 at the back alongside Falcao, van Persie and Rooney. They're both talented players and we should get behind both of them but instead some will use any glimpse of promise from one young player to shit on another like Willo, Lingard, Adnan. Its as if only one of them can be good.

720~~~
Showed some real maturity amid the passion of the derby today. I'm absolutely chuffed to bits for him taking the opportunity given to him, he's got the raw tools of a great player in the making. We just have to develop him correctly.

721~~~
Dunno, why Wilson is being brought up but his problem is mainly injuries at this stage and also toughing up a bit physically.

As a instinctive finisher and striker he's fantastic talent.

722~~~
His performances will be attracting a fair bit of attention. Could land a very decent PL loan next season, which would be incredible for a teenager.

723~~~
Wilson is an excellent player but he does not yet have the hastle Rashfords shown. Wilson and Keane are excellent young players - I certainly wouldn't rule Keane out. He's just been unlucky. But Rashford is doing really well. He hadn't scored for a few games but showed a good mentality when he scored his goal. His movement is something we've missed for a long time.

724~~~
He is tough.

725~~~
Him and Martial. We have to build our attack around them.

726~~~
could be a another Cole and Yorke.....

727~~~
His goal today really reminded me of Martial's against Liverpool on his debut. The way time stood still as he opened himself up and then slotted it ice cool like!

728~~~
So have countless others at his age. Wilson and Kiko were banging them in left, right and centre in the reserves/U21. Both even scored on their debut for us but lets be honest a outstanding 18 year old can become a average 20 year old...

Rashford looks the real deal but theres a long way to go

729~~~
Anyone else feel like this fella looks like two completely different guys depending on whether you see him from the front or from the side?

730~~~
Agreed both have electric pace and can finish under pressure.

731~~~
Pace, intelligent running, cool finishing, quick feet and he's still only 18. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

732~~~
Wilson and Macheda have never impressed this much in the senior team. People here are so used to negativity that they can't even appreciate a genuine talent.

733~~~
Really hope he can make it.

I remember when Welbeck exploded on the scene for us and I had high hopes for him.

734~~~
And some people cant praise one talent without shaming another.

Kids talented but lets not go making him out to be the next Messi

735~~~
Why would any of them be shown the door?
Martial, Rashford and Lingard have all done well. They should not start all games as they are currently but this should be the future.

736~~~
Another great performance. Constantly running channels and being and outlet. Took his goal brilliantly.

737~~~
Flawless performance today, this kid is absolute quality and I hope Mourinho doesn't feck with him by sending him out on loan like he did with Lukaku.

738~~~
Any news on his injury?

739~~~
Just cramp wasn't it?

740~~~
Hero.

741~~~
His pace is electric. Might be a bit too honest getting up from his cramp because the crowd got on his back.

742~~~
2 bald black attackers. Other than that... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

743~~~
No..no...but we gave away Welbeck...

744~~~
After the Welbeck ship has sailed, i want this young man to succeed.

 Please x1000 football god. Please make it happen.

745~~~
Rashford?! We aint loaning him anywhere son, he's starting!

746~~~
Skinned Demichales,good performance from the kid

747~~~
Afraid to break it to you but that stuff on the top of Martial and Rashford's heads is in fact hair.

748~~~
Bald? Are you unable to see hair on black men's heads?

749~~~
hope it was just a cramp, apart that he was great again, love his attitude, should have had a penalty

750~~~
Who is saying he's the next Messi?

In a season full of negatives, you're trying to find faults with people getting happy about a young Mancunian breaking throughm incredible.

751~~~
Must have been a massive moment for him today, derby winner and all. Just great to see him doing so well.

752~~~
He still goes to school right?

Imagine that. Going to school as the winner of the Manchester derby.

753~~~
Alright, baldish...

Thinking about it, Cole and Yorke had hair as well.

754~~~
<img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/><img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/><img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

755~~~
His 18!!!

756~~~
He knows how to score, knows how to penetrate tight defenses with his slippery movement. He is a pure and skilled endowed stud.

757~~~
Looking like we may have produced a genuine first XI player from the academy at last, although I hope we give him some rest at some point.

Speaking of baldness (see above), it looks like Wayne needs a new transplant judging from the overhead shot today.

758~~~
Maybe with Rashford, who is a proper striker, people will finally get over Bambi leaving.

759~~~
He's like Welbeck - only he can finish. Looks a natural forward. Big things to come from him.

760~~~
I suspect he won't get any rest till Rooney is fit
We are hardly overflowing with viable options in attack

761~~~
Apart from skin colour I really dont see many similarities. He is even quicker than Danny which was one of his attributes.

762~~~
Glorious goal, looking forward to seeing it replayed a hundred times.

Did well to keep his cool when that shower of cnuts were surrounding him pretending that he dived.

763~~~
Wonderful goal. Left Demichellis for dead. Great stuff.

764~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Too many people, including <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/29473438" target="_blank">himself</a>?

765~~~
Goal that is easily on current level of Martial's skill set. Instead of constantly looking for players in the back to pass he's taking a defender (Skrtel/Demichelis) with acceleration then surgically putting ball in the net. You do not need lectures on philosophy to make things better for the match day.

It was all about instinct and natural drive for goal. He has it and with better assist specialists around him next season he could cause more damage.

766~~~
Him and Martial were bright today. Fantastic goal by Rashford.

I would be annoyed if Rooney came straight back into the team in place of Rashford

767~~~
If he bulks up sufficiently, he has the potential to be a real beastly striker IMO. Some players you don't want to bulk up so they don't lose their agility, but he seems to have the frame to be a real dominant guy up top, and the quality on the ball as well. Brilliant today, though he obviously tired in the second half.

768~~~
Yes... that is exactly what i'm doing...

769~~~
yeah after scoring some goals for the national team media and he convinced himself that he can be that striker, saw a bigger role for himself, what's funny? Being a bit ambitious and confident is part of every top athlete, it's like if Bale didn't see himself as winger or capable of things, he wouldn't move on, he had that potential to be that player but if he developed as leftback he could decent but rather one of many. I think Welbeck showed he can fire goals for England up front but his potential is bigger playing elsewhere...
time will tell if he stays fit which might be a problem

770~~~
The next Messi.
<span style="color: #ffffff"><a class="username" data-user="38903, @KM" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/38903/">@KM</a></span>

771~~~
Worth noting his passing accuracy was 100% today. Not bad for leading the line away in a Manchester derby..

772~~~
United have scored 6 goals against the current top 4 teams so far, half of them by Rashford in just 2 appearances. He makes a difference up front.

773~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

774~~~
Pace is a scary thing for defenders, especially the state of defenders in the league right now. Still bonkers to think after scoring the goals he did, he was pushed to the Right wing against Liverpool when we needed goals.

Anyway, happy to see him perform like he did. Should have had a penalty as well. Kept running despite what looked like a cramp as well. Mad. Dude never stopped running for us.

775~~~
What he's done for us so far, the way he's played, is fecking unreal for a 18 year old.

776~~~
He takes up decent positions and his movement is good. He's quick, athletic, holds the ball up well. I see similarities to be honest. 

He looks to have the key attribute in a forward - the ability to find the net. Hopefully it continues.

777~~~
Rashford will be better than Welbeck. He has much more composure.

778~~~
Great goal and very good performance in his derby debut.

779~~~
Welbeck would have tried to lob Hart with that chance, and he'd have fecked it up

780~~~
His second touch after attempting to take on Demichelis would have put the ball over the by line, with him scrambling after it.

781~~~
He gets in the channels very much like Welbeck did. Looks to have that similar rangey stride too but his early goals suggest he is far mire instinctive in and around the six yard box than Welbeck ever was.

782~~~
Na bro,  he's a squad player now, he ain't going anywhere.

783~~~
Best thing about today's goal was that he actually had a bit of time to think about it and kept his composure to finish it which can often be more difficult than the instinctive type of finishes which he's shown for the first team so far

784~~~
Thank god Rooney is out so this lad is getting chances.
It's been a while since we had that kind of movement up top from our front three.

785~~~
The 6th form girls must be wetting their pants!  Well done to him.

786~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Had a very good game, that run right at the end to win the corner was class

787~~~
His twitter account has 61 followers,  start following him!

788~~~
He fecking rapid as well. I think there was a point in the game where he absolutely destroyed Clichy through his acceleration, and he's no slouch.

789~~~
No. Why the no love for the Welbeck? He would have fallen over hitting the ball. I don't know why such a big lad can't keep his balance. Even Chadwick could keep his balance.

790~~~
He's so good! That late run in the dying seconds when he was struggling helped majorly. Great goal as well.

Him over Rooney every single day of the week.

791~~~
His calves were probably burning the whole time as well.

792~~~
I think Welbz learned that PPM off of Rooney, bad tutor choice. /FM

793~~~
Ffs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

794~~~
No, he's seen Sagna's hair, and Abel Xavier's too. Although Sagna's gone bald lately.

795~~~
He's not on twitter

796~~~
I'm surprised by Rashford, I thought that he was good with the u18 but I never thought that he would adapt that easily to professional football, that's not easy, the game is different at that level, the rhythm, the intensity, the physicality are very different and he looks like a fish in the water, he plays like a PL striker. That's a good surprise.

797~~~
Well I hope this is his twitter <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Take a look at Marcus Rashford (@RashfordOficial): <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/RashfordOficial?s=09" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/RashfordOficial?s=09</a>

798~~~
Got to give him credit, since he's come into the first team he's more than shown he deserves a starting spot. Hopefully he just keeps his head down and focuses on getting better and not thinking he's made it already, if he does he has a very good future ahead of him. Good thing is he doesn't seem to be like another Macheda

799~~~
Doubt that'll be legit?

800~~~
Of course it's not. And it has 6 followers, not 61

801~~~
If it is he's absolutely off his tits, giving away his match shirt, boots, and at this rate probably his matchday undies.

802~~~
Ahh FFS!  I don't normally use twitter.  That's my excuse anyway<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

803~~~
Some players make the jump easier than others.

What he has had on his side is a Van Gaal who trusted him to start 8 matches in a row. And Rooney being out making it easier to start him.

804~~~
He's got a wonderful nose on him..

For goal that is... obviously.

805~~~
People need to give up this comparing every attacker came through the academy with Macheda.

806~~~
This kid is the real deal. He's got pace, power, guile, skill, and that killer instinct.

807~~~
That goal reminded me of Torres vs Chelsea in 2008

808~~~
He is such a naturally gifted striker and that pace is absolutely electrifying. Relishing the idea of him and Martial up front. He has not been fazed by anything. Him and Martial really are cool as ice and matured for their age. Thank feck Rooney is injured and hoe he ain't back till end of season and offloaded to China.

809~~~
At the end of this season, I would remember him as one of the bright sparks for us.

810~~~
I suppose Spurs is also on his list for ending a clubs title race. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

811~~~
Starting to look like the real deal. When the team is playing well and creating chances he isn't missing much at all.

812~~~
I really hope it doesn't become a matter of playing either Rashford or Martial, once Rooney is fit. The two should be starting together every game they are fit. They are the future.

813~~~
Generally, taller people have a higher centre of gravity and lesser balance.

814~~~
Yeah, people don't seem to realize that the top footballers aren't actually tall. Aguero is like 174cm, Silva is like 170cm, Messi about the same.

CR7 and his type are truly the exception, and even CR7 is fairly short compared to other top athletes of other sports. In fact, football may be the "shortest" mainstream sport in the world. Much easier to change direction and maintain balance when you have a low center of gravity.

815~~~
Would like to see Martial and Rashford play as the two strikers in a 4411 with Lingard on the left and Januzaj on the right.

816~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

817~~~
Number 1 player in the world in my book

818~~~
I doubt it as he mispelt "official"

819~~~
Just goes to show that youth football is not really a great indicator of who will make it. Sometimes the most unlikely ones do. Don't know too much about Harry Kane but he did have rather poor loan spells and he is perhaps the best PL striker now. Now Rashford making big strides as well. Amazing really.

820~~~
It has a lot to do with a player's psychological toughness as well. That's why you see players who were never deemed "good enough" go and make a mark and those with all the potential in the world, built of glass. But Rashford as far as I know was always heavily touted to be a very good footballer. Even Ashley Fletcher is quite highly rated along with Mitchell from his age group.

Edit: But those two have really had stop start developments, especially Mitchell.

821~~~
Great performance from him yesterday. Besides the composure and presence of mind to take his goal so well, the work rate, and tracking back, as well as working the channels, he's got it all. Him and Martial are the future. 

I was thinking about all the 'Losing our identity' threads we had on here after the last two summers; Ironic that we ended up depending on our academy after all.

822~~~
I think we have to thank the gods for Rooneys injury really. It'll be interesting to see what happens on his return.

823~~~
Good point. Rashford, CBJ and others have done well. It's a shame some people live in the past. The kids haven't let us down.

824~~~
He's been the highlight of a shite season for me. I know Demichelis is an absolute donkey but that goal yesterday was top class. Hopefully Jose gives him plenty of chances next season and Rooney fecks off.

825~~~
I find it hard to get excited by some of the youngsters that some have gotten excited about over the years; Cleverley, Welbeck & McNair all immediately spring to mind. But Rashford has definitely got me excited, he looks such a talented player and is only 18!

826~~~
Genuinely hopeful that he will be our harry kane. If he can get another 3 or 4 this season it'll be remarkable. High hopes for him, plus he clearly loves the club which is great. Would be nice to not have to worry about the striker position as well. Could focus more on cb, cm and a winger then.

827~~~
Yeah, Kane wasn't too hot, but Pochettino gave him some Europa games rather than Soldado or whoever was starting for them, and he just kept scoring until he couldn't be left out of the starting 11.

828~~~
He must have won the ball about three times doing this, nipping in when their players thought they had time, great to see.

829~~~
True. But Harry Kane was 21(I think) and had some loan experience and playing for a club with lower expectations.

For Rashford to come in and score goals against the likes of Man City and Arsenal at 18 for a team massively struggling but with sky high expectations is phenomenal really. Obviously he needs to maintain his level and improve but he seems like he could be a great player (potentially)

Not knocking Kane as he has done phenomenally too and would love him here

830~~~
Definitely, what Rashford is doing is incredible. Something out of Roy of the Rovers, or FM.

831~~~
We already know what's going to happen on his return, sadly.

832~~~
Was Rashford considered one of the next big things coming out the academy, or has he just seized the opportunity he's been given?

833~~~
He was actually, one of the best attacking talents for the last u18 group, along with Mitchell who is more of a pure winger and suffered some injuries.

834~~~
Ballon D'or for Marcus

835~~~
Yeah, I remember seeing a tweet awhile back when Welbeck was sold saying that no one would remember him once Rashford broke through. Still seemed like he was comfortably behind Keane and Wilson in the pecking order, though.

836~~~
He's younger than they are, he is in a different age group. Furthermore, he has also just been transformed to a striker, he used to play on the wing. So they werent really comparable.

837~~~
He's 5 years younger than Keane and 2 younger than Wilson, Keane and Wilson were both more impressive as goalscorers in the underage setup but Rashford has always been very highly rated by the staff and was given 1 of the highest paying contracts that we've ever given to an u18 player. Up until last year he was playing as a winger or 2nd striker so he has a lot of attributes which some strikers don't have that are helping him with the step up such as dribbling ability, link up play and ability to be effective on the wings. 2 things he's had over Keane and Wilson which have been partly due to circumstances and partly due to how well he's taken his chance have been that he's gotten a proper run of games in the first team and that he's managed to stay fit when his opportunity arose

838~~~
Kane was pretty much as likely as can be. He was scoring about a goal a game for the u18s and has 11 goals and 10 assists in 14 u21 matches. He also has an impressive record at youth international level and won Millwall's young player of the year. He was also pretty good for Leyton Orient, averaging a goal every 180 minutes. The only thing it shows it that you shouldn't judge young players on loans where they never get to play bar some 10-20 minute cameos off the bench.

839~~~
Fletcher has never been particularly highly rated partly because he was in the same age group as Wilson who was always miles ahead of him and he is 2 years older than Rashford, they only played in the same age group when Rashford was playing u18 as an u16 player. Mitchell's injury problems and lack of growth physically have made the past 18 months a write off for him which is a pity because he has plenty of talent.

840~~~
Yes, I am aware that Fletcher was in Wilson's group, but I thought he was fairly highly rated. He seems to be doing decent at his loan spell if I am not mistaken.

Shame about Mitchell though, thought we would have a proper genuine winger in him. Hope he still makes it.

841~~~
feck Kane, he's gonna be Rashmàrio. Hopefully without the smoking and shagging instead of training thing <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

842~~~
Plus if you just watch them play Fletcher just looks much stiffer than both Wilson and Rashford.

843~~~
Nice words from Becks

<a class="externalLink" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BDOdpeqTWaf/?hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/p/BDOdpeqTWaf/?hl=en</a>

844~~~
The good thing about him being introduced late in the season is that he can be played in every game without any fear of burnout. Martial has played a little too much imo but we haven't got the players to be able to afford him a break.

845~~~
Martial is a completely different animal to the usual 20 year old though, both physically and mentally, so I actually don't have a problem with him being played when available. Good point on Rashford, it's definitely for the best that he was introduced late both for us and him.

846~~~
Is there a chance he will go to the Euros? Very competitive for place in his position so I doubt it but if he fires us to top four and an FA Cup he can't be ignored.

847~~~
Absolutely not imo. There are too many strikers available atm. I guess there is small chance if Sturridge doesn't make the squad but even then, I expect Rooney, Kane, Vardy to be the 3 strikers to be picked.

848~~~
Zero chance.

Woy will pick Rooney, Kane, Vardy and Welbeck/Sturridge.

849~~~
Many have cited the fact that he's been given a run of games as to why he's had an unfair advantage over the likes of Wilson and Keane, but that is because he's earned it. 

He's started game over Jesse and Memphis in that run, who are older, have bigger reputations and cost a lot of money in Memphis' case. 

Fair play to him.

850~~~
They're different positions though so it doesn't really have to be one or the other. One is a Striker and one is Midfielder. Let's keep them both in our squad I say. I don't see why Lingard should be shown the door.

Great passionate performance by the lad yesterday. He just ran and ran. I bet his legs were full of cramp back in the dressing room whilst Demichelis' mind was filled with nightmares!

851~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xlf1/v/t1.0-9/11181687_1095361990485042_1363441739568276180_n.jpg?oh=be06731f9594f6adcf04cd2aeda63239&amp;oe=5789B50C" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xlf1/v/t1.0-9/11181687_1095361990485042_1363441739568276180_n.jpg?oh=be06731f9594f6adcf04cd2aeda63239&amp;oe=5789B50C"/>

852~~~
It's dangerous to say anything based on such a small sample size, but I'll say this: He's got the right head for being thrown in at the deep end.

853~~~
Certainly should be our starting number 9 from now on. It would be a travesty if Rooney would just walk back into the team over him.

854~~~
He will be and should be ignored. Kane and Vardy are firing their teams to the title for the full 9 month season. Rooney is the captain and Studge (sturridge) is class when fit. In fact I would be happy if Rashford became as good as Studge in the future.

855~~~
Especially since we're used of being let down the past few seasons.

856~~~
He must be such a boss at his school now. I thought footballers leave school at like 16 but it seems he still goes. Imagine going into secondary school having scored the winner in the city derby playing against multimillionaires and players from your national team.

857~~~
While also making a fecking huge amount of dosh yourself

858~~~
I thought a player having another player "in their pocket" was a defensive term? A sign that they've marked them really well by being so close to them all game? Surely a striker would want to escape from a defender, and would want separation from them? Have I understood the phrase wrong in the past?

859~~~
Just curious as it pertains to Marcus.

But what do people consider a good enough sample size?

With Kiko, he had a close title saving cameos, some sub appearances, and burnt out. Wilson had a couple of games in a row. And even in those, I don't remember any of them looking as good as Marcus. 

But no other youngster had been given a start in 6-8 in a row like Marcus right? How sale size is continuing to grow, and he is growing with it.  Just wondering what else people need to see before he is fully endorsed.

860~~~
I'd rather he didn't, but there's a chance he could go. I remember Aaron Lennon and Theo Walcott going to tournaments at the same age. I can't remember if Theo played at that first one, but I remember Lennon coming on as an impact sub with his ridiculous pace. It's a longshot, but I would be overly surprised of Rashford is taken as a different option. He's looked good from the right wing as well, burning down the outside, and he's already a better finisher than Sterling.

You just don't know who is going to get injured between now and June either.

861~~~
You're not alone. That's how I've always seen it.

862~~~
You're correct. A more fitting sentence would be Rashford had him on toast <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

863~~~
It depends what conclusion you want to draw. I've seen enough to know that he's got the potential to be very good, but I'd say you need at least half a season, if not more, to come to the conclusion that he's going to make it. For example, I'm willing to say Martial is going to be an absolute top player. For Rashford, I'd say it's probably a bit too soon.

864~~~
Between 6 months and a full season for me. There have been so many players, specially young ones who have been incredible for a short period of time only for them to be truly worse than what they showed during that time. Consistency and time always separates the good ones from the not so good.

865~~~
That's extremely fair. I have more of an issue with saying the kid can't play than I do saying he is the messiah. Which I'm not saying he is.

For me,  one of the main differences between him and others,  is the fact that United are relying in the kid as much as they are and I can't remember that happening to another kid in a very long time.

The performances he's put in with the amount of pressure on him since the team is not as sharp is what leads me to the amount of positivety I have towards him in the future.

866~~~
I thought the pressure Martial was under was too much for his first season but it is even bigger for Rashford.

867~~~
I think so too. But it's comparable in any case, and both have dealt with it very well.

868~~~
The counter argument to that is that Rashford's got nothing to lose and everything to win, since so many of our senior players have been so shite.

869~~~
I would say at least a season and a half, as you'll recall form Kane everybody kept worrying he could be a one season wonder and then at the start of this season a lot of people had decided he was if you look at the Kane thread. Obviously you will have a very strong idea well before then but players can overplay and underplay for pretty long stretches so it is hard to draw anything conclusive just based off one season. Rashford is well below the threshold for saying anything definitive and I would be happy at this point for him to have a loan next season either at a title fighting championship team or a lower premier league club as long as they can guarantee him minutes, which hopefully we won't be able to do due to transfers.

870~~~
Shows you how underrated young footballers are in English football. Its made out like the prem is some ridiculously high level of football thats borderline impossible to get thrown in and adjust immediately yet here we have a bunch of young players from the academy who are doing better than their more experienced counterparts. Im of the opinion that many potential prem careers have gone down the drain cause of managers without a clue.

871~~~
And sometimes you can get over cautious with how you handle kids, he is soing the business in the first team and has given us something different to our other forwards so omo we should handle him in the same way SAF handled Ronaldo. We should play him when possible and rest him when necessary so that he doesn't burn out. Signing a reliabke veteran like Zlatan would also pressure on him and Martial, allowing them to grow at their own pace.

872~~~
You are right. "In the pocket" generally refers to a defender, keeping an striker at bay. In this case, a defender was constantly harried by a striker, so much, that he almost went to blows with him. (Penalty call). So, the phrase has been used to describe the frustration of the defender.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/1914325_1096876620333579_8244590159527329337_n.jpg?oh=5314105e7d46cdc399e30762eb0cc53a&amp;oe=574B7DF8" src="https://scontent-sin1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/1914325_1096876620333579_8244590159527329337_n.jpg?oh=5314105e7d46cdc399e30762eb0cc53a&amp;oe=574B7DF8"/>

873~~~
Be interesting to see how he gets on in Holland or the Championship next season.

874~~~
Definitely, but its possible he is on the crest of a wave at the minute and opinions on him could flip after a bad stretch of games as they have with numerous players, just look at how much the opinions on depay have changed through the season. It will be a different matter when he's not a bonus player from the under 18's but considered actually part of the furniture, that adds a lot of responsibility and pressure to him. Its also fair to say regardless of what we want Rooney will walk back into the team so his minutes are about to reduce considerably I would imagine, its in that scenario I would rather have a loan than what James Wilson was doing for the first half of the season, whatever that was.

875~~~
Van Gaal is gone at the end of the season and any decent manager won't take shit from Rooney so Rashford will play, between the U21s, COC, Europa and the PL he sill get enough games.

876~~~
Zero chance that'll happen now. He'll be given a year as a squad member, and if it isn't working out end of next year he'll be loaned.

877~~~
If Jose comes next season and spends tonnes of money, it's a possibility.

878~~~
Doubt it. He's made too much of an impact, and the fact he can play wide means he'll get another season before we consider loaning him.

879~~~
Personally think of Jose does come, then there will be some agreements in place to keep with the traditions of the club using academy players and Rashford will be up there in terms of choice. Not only that but, have to think at some point Jose has learned, that you can only get so much out of mercenaries. He'll want players around that fight for the badge - and as much as I don't care for Terry (and Lampard to a degree), those are the types he needs to have in the squad. Also, am sure he is smarting from the bad decision of letting Lukaku go, so will be hesitant to let a player like Rashford leave on loan or otherwise.

880~~~
They have no idea do they... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

881~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> what the feck is that

882~~~
Lukaku wanted to go for game time.

De Bruyne similar.

883~~~
Good post but I'm sure if you're destine to be a top professional nothing will get in your way, not even bad coaching. It may have affected poorer mentally players who could've made a career playing bottom/midtable.

884~~~
Rashford is also going to want game time next season after breaking into the first team so is in the same situation as both of them albeit he is younger.

885~~~
Hopefully he is. Don't forget not too long ago mourinho wanted to sign rooney for Chelsea. I really don't feel he will get enough games at any premier league team towards the top, can you imagine city for instance sticking with him, I know its what makes us unique but that was easier when  we were successful, he should go somewhere guaranteeing him minutes.

886~~~
Disagree, some really big talents have fallen by the wayside due to bad coaching.

887~~~
From what I remember at the time and just after De Bruyne was a massive pain in the arse at Chelsea and to Mourinho's credit he tried very hard to keep him. But then the Lukaku example just shows how shite Mourinho is with youngster.
And that's my biggest worry(Well actually one of many) with Mourinho getting the job. It's not just that he won't play the youngsters we have now although there's every chance that could happen, it's that future players won't get the same chances as the likes of Rashford and others have had so far under Van Gaal.

888~~~
You cannot compare the situation of Lukaku and De Bruyne with Rashford. 

Lukaku and De Bruyne came for a relatively large transfer fee for a young player, and would of been expected to be a regular part of the team. 

Lukaku cost 20m, De Bruyne 7m. Rashford broke through from the academy before even he would of expected, he wasn't even a regular for he u21s I believe?

Completely different scenarios.

889~~~
One of the many reasons I want Pochettino instead of Mourinho.

890~~~
This.
kDB am not too sure but Lukaku was already a first team player before his move to Chelsea.
As much as I don't want Jose I don't buy into him not giving kids a chance. He gives them a chance if and if they deliver to his standards he'll keep using them. In a results based industry it's all about standard, it's always been the responsibility of young players to progress to a point they can't be ignored.
Not directing this to the Lukakus or KDBs, you don't demand your way into games but work for it through patience and progression. We all seem to forget that the moment the manager starts including you in first team training you are in his plans, it's your responsibility as a youngster to prove in training you are ready for added responsibilities. If you can't prove in training you are better than than your established first team competition, common sense says you are unlikelier to outperform the on match day.

Gets an assist on his U20s debut, but the team loses. NOT GOOD ENOUGH. RASHFORD'S FAULT.

Are the tabloids that desperate for the kid to fail?

902~~~
The english press needs to get a new target they can work on for the next 15 years..

903~~~
Really can't believe I'm typing this - but I would like the club to have him watch Vardy and try to emulate his movement. If he could learn to press as well as Vardy does he'd be a hell of a player alone based off of his speed.

910~~~
Rashford has been sent from the future to destroy us all

911~~~
We will need "THE REAL PASSION" tomorrow

912~~~
Looks sharp but service as usual is piss poor. What the feck is our right flank... He's having to drift over there as well to create any threat.

913~~~
Might be a controversial opinion but I don't think he's that talented. He's like Josh King with a good instinct for goals. That's valuable but he's quite poor in a lot of areas.

914~~~
He's still only 18, though. Plenty of time for him to develop in those areas.

915~~~
His perfectly measured and in tempo backheel pass in setup for Martal's goal was quite awesome.

Bit of Totti-esque stuff right there.

916~~~
He's not as talented as Iheanacho for example. Not as well rounded technically from what I've seen. Lots of time to improve though

917~~~
Disagree, he's finding his feet at this level obviously, but he's far more technically gifted than Josh King was

918~~~
Very pleased with what he's been able to do so far. He's only 18 and has had a trial by fire in terms of learning PL football without disappointing. I think he'll make it here. He looks like the real deal.

919~~~
I thought he played well but I'd like to see him stay central most of the time as too often we only had Lingard trying to get on the end of decent crosses. Good link up both with Martial and with TFM for our goal.

920~~~
I thought his all round play today was good, he links well and runs the channels, the fact him and Martial are expected to do a lot of the creating and scoring themselves is an issue, but no complaints about his progression in the first team from me.

921~~~
Schmeichael is obsessed about dropping him. Yeah lets play Depay through there ffs.
Its only CL that's at risk. When City sign Pogba etc because they have CL football at least we gave Rashford a rest...

922~~~
Thought he did well. Couple of successful backheels, which was good to see. He's developing before our eyes and it's very exciting.

923~~~
Rashford is exciting already but once he fills out physically he'll be even more so.

924~~~
Yeah I agree with what's been said, it appears as though he's developed slightly some aspect of his game each time I see him. The backheels today were very cleverly timed and executed for example.

925~~~
I am still not sure he is that special either but he is very different to Joshua King for me.

926~~~
I'd say premature rather than controversial.

Poor in lots of areas? I'm not saying he's brilliant in everything he does but I've not noticed one particular area in which he's poor either. 

What kind of things do you think he's poor at?

927~~~
the backheels always look so flashy but the thing is that in real life with a bit of vision it really is not that hard to execute. This is not something he developed lately, the combination game you learn from the early age is full of this but yeah it looks great:-) 
I dont't think that Rashford's allround game today was that good, a lot of things didn't come out for him today but I am still quite impressed by his stamina/physical game, he looks very fit to finish 90 minutes and he only moved from U18s! Wilson on the other hand always looks like he can't catch the breath. Rashford doesn't seem to tire even though he press defenders quite a lot. Once he bulks up a bit and get into tempo of a senior game more he will be some striker, he's such a great athlete..

928~~~
He's practically non-existent in the air, poor at holding the ball up, lacks the dribbling ability to beat his man without the simple use of pure pace, doesn't strike the ball particularly well...he's promising but I think a lot of the expectations are unfounded.

929~~~
I tend to agree. Hes young and will learn. Very promising, as well as inexperienced.

As for the heading, he seems to be scared of the physical challenge.

930~~~
Hasn't he scored two headers since coming into the team? Hardly non existent.

I think his hold up play has been fine. Its not great but given it's usually a youngsters weakness I definitely wouldn't call it poor.

Have to say the criticism of his ability to beat a man is just plain wrong. To say he can only beat a man one way is nitpicking.

931~~~
Rashfood has been sped through the system but he's done well. He offers good movement and he's not the finished article. Normally we might be seeing Wilson or even Keane if he never got that injury. So he's come in and done very well. I doubt many would have thought he'd score the winner against City. Despite their defensive flaws, we're still talking about someone who was playing under 18 football not so long ago. When you think that Kane is 22/23 - similar to Lukaku...Rashfood is ahead of the curve and I wouldn't say he's overrated. I think he has contributed greatly to our recent form but it's early days. He's looks like a wide type forward to me. Give him some space and he will try something.

Even today, some nice touches around the box. Not the best game but always involved. Today was a bit of a battle and he has a good level of confidence. He isn't a weak players but he will get stronger.

932~~~
Good post

933~~~
Rashfood? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

934~~~
Sorry guys, must be hungry <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

935~~~
Didn't think he was that good today but overall, I've been very impressed. Hard to say how good he will get but for an 18 year old, he's had an excellent start to his senior career.

936~~~
You could've probably worded that better...

937~~~
He's grown a lot in the last two years, but he's still really skinny. He does need to be braver in the air, but that will come with time. 

He's really easy to knock off the ball at the minute, he's trying his best to keep it, leaning in to the defender and using his footwork but it's understandably not been easy for him

938~~~
In the box he's great at finding space and finishing from close range in whatever way possible, and that's an invaluable trait. I just think outside of that he offers very little. He's not as limited as Macheda but I really don't think he's a million miles away either.

My point about his dribbling was probably poorly worded. To put it more bluntly, I don't think he can dribble. He can just run really fast like Josh King. King actually has more successful "dribbles" and is dispossessed less often. Neither of them really possess great control at pace. They're both pretty poor at holding the ball up and making an offer as the point of attack in the air or on the ground.

Rashford still has plenty of growing left but I'd be surprised if he turned into a fundamentally different player to King or overcame those fundamental weaknesses. The Rashford hype is completely understandable given the impact he's had but I just think it's prevented people from thinking about him in any critical way.

939~~~
Hehe

940~~~
Having an outlet of a proper striker (well one who can get in behind, occupy defenders) has been much needed. Hes no where near a finished article (obviously) but so much potential to grow.

Obviously fast tracked into the team out of necessity (everybody being injured) but hes done really well. Plays with no fear.

941~~~
Obviously I disagree, I think in limited appearances with no previous experience of this level we've seen him doing the stuff you think he's poor at. Holding the ball up, running channels etc

One more point is that he's a centre forward not a winger. Thinking back over the last 30 years I'm struggling to think of United centre forwards who were very good at dribbling and beating men without relying on their pace. Seems unfair to expect that of him when the previous greats playing in his position were no better or even worse.

942~~~
Thought Jagielka, who is very quick himself, played Rashford pretty well, more so as the game went on.

943~~~
Surely the point is that he looks reasonably promising for an 18-year old (and keep in mind there have been some rather impressive strikers at 18) but the fact that he's starting for Manchester United is a testament to our current squad rather than his ability. I mean, compare him to Rooney at the same age. 

Not saying he won't develop, but there's no way he should be starting for us at this stage of his career.

944~~~
To be fair, I can't think of many, if any, players who would do well with that comparison.

945~~~
Agreed, that's why very few 18 year olds are starting up front for a 'European great' team. 

My point isn't about Rashford per se, it's that our standards have been ridiculously eroded over the past 2 seasons. If we genuinely want to compete with PSG/Bayern/Real/Barca/City...we have Rashford vs Ibra/Lewandowski/Ronaldo/Suarez/Aguero. 

Sob. Over the past decade we've had Ruud, then Ruud and Rooney, then Ruud, Rooney and Saha...tevez, Berbatov and so forth and so on. Now we have a spent Rooney and Marcus Rashford.

946~~~
It's definitely not good enough, but not so long ago Rooney was amongst those names mentioned. It looks like he'll never get back to that as a #9 and really in our attack he is the one that needs replacing with a top class, proven player.

Also you neglect to mention Martial, probably Europes top young talent in the forward department.

947~~~
"A 35 year old uncle" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Also, why pick that second picture, and the sentence structure is so odd it's hilarious <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

948~~~
Yeah, that's fair, should have him there, if the next manager agrees to play him up top! Still, we're a shadow...think of our 4 options in the treble year!

949~~~
Berbatov Rooney Ronaldo and Tevez, or as I liked to call them berbaronaroonavez. All in or around the peak of their powers.

Still never could fit them in one team though, to have that headache again.

Transition though innit, mou will fix it.

950~~~
I think that is fair. But probably the wrong time to pull it out of the front pocket, I'd have kept it tucked in there for when he goes on loan next season. Saw a clip of some of his touches, nice and instinctive but he is still just a kid. Not a Wayne Rooney at 18 looking seriously like he's world class already type of kid but a kid with a lot of developing to do.

As great as he has been, the story that he has to tell about the start of his career. I still would have no hesitation sending him back to the 18's (and then on loan next season) when we have our full complement of attackers back as well as purchases in the summer.

You can't blame people for getting defensive about his ability at the moment while his hype is still in full swing.

I still think it is stone wall a "system" issue of why our attack has looked blunt with about 14 different combinations of players in the starting lineup.

951~~~
He's very raw in terms of his decision making and hold up play, but he's new to the position having only had 1-2 years education there so I expect him to improve in that regard. The strength and conditioning aspect will come along now he's training with the first and he will become stronger and learn how to utilise his body better.

His dribbling in tight spaces is much better than King's, he's not just a punt and chase merchant and his composure in front of goal is also much better. If he develops his game over the next few years and stays injury free then he could have a very good career here.

952~~~
I thought he showed a lot more on the ball today than in his previous matches - that backheel was crucial for the goal. He <i>is</i> limited but I don't know how rounded we can expect an unheralded teenager to be. If he can grow some upper bdy strength to be able to hold the ball with his back to goal, he'd have a decent set of skills - pace, finishing, flicks/short passing, hold-up play.

953~~~
Thought he looked more confident today than he did previously

954~~~
I guess that he'll be dropped to make way for Rooney when he returns?  Possibly next weekend as Rooney is lined up for the u21s

Or will Mata be dropped instead?

955~~~
I don't think he needs to be dropped but I wouldn't be against him being "rested" for a couple of games. He has really been thrown in at the deep end and I think we need to take him out of the firing line here and there, a bit like Ferguson used to be so good at doing. I know we are short on options and battling for a top four place but we need to think about what is best for Rashford's future as well.

But overall I think both him and TFM acquitted themselves well yesterday. I have a good feeling that both will be in the team for many years to come.

956~~~
I don't think it's a case of getting defensive over him. I just don't see any reason to be critical about his game. Whilst he can obviously get better in everything he does he's so far showed a bit of everything. Instinctive finishes, headers, intricate play around the area, doing people for pace, trickery in beating Demichelis. Just not sure what there is to criticise and I enjoy moaning.

957~~~
People try to compare him with Josh King must be talking out of their asses.Rashford has way more on his game than Josh.His touch and close control is superb and he's the type of player that can make something out of nothing.Sometimes Marcus overused his pace too much as most of the pacey teenager attacking players do but he'll learn.

958~~~
I was specifically talking about people being on the front foot about how he'll be part of our plans next season. He is still very raw and people still need to be patient as his game develops.

959~~~
He should be part of our plans next term, as in taking up a supersub/squad role whilst we sort the Rooney question. It's pointless buying another striker if we aren't getting rid of Rooney and if we are planning on playing a lone striker formation or any other 4-5-1/4-3-3 variant, as we do not need 4 strikers for what is essentially one position (Spurs have done well enough with Kane as their sole recognised senior striker). So, with that in mind, a trio of Rooney, Martial and Rashford as our three strikers will be quite enough. If he is going to be loaned out it will have to be the season after next when he'd have adopted to the professional, tactical and work ethic requirements demanded here.

960~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Josh has scored 14 goals in 133 professional games. Rashford 5 goals in 9 professional games and at the top level!

961~~~
It depends on a number of factors. Who will be managing and James Wilson/Will Keane for starters. The Rooney situation all comes down to who will be managing next season in my opinion and I won't be disappointed if in the washup that Rashford goes back down to the 21's or goes out to the Championship or the Top division on loan. I think that it will probably benefit him getting a year of consistent football as he has skipped a lot of steps in the progression from the 18's to the first team.

I think people need to be prepared for that and to be patient about his potential in development. He is raw and he has the ability, we have to make tough decisions at the end of this season and I don't think everyone will be left satisfied.

962~~~
It's a very random comparison. What I find funny is that when likening one player to another they always have the same skin colour. Always happens.

963~~~
There is a thin line between being patient about a player's potential and holding a young player back unnecessarily so whilst what you say has some merit we always have to consider that this young man took his chance where countless others fail so we need to reward that. Sending him down to the U21s or on loan to some Championship team is not a reward, keeping him in and around the first team, obviously with reduced responsibilities, is a reward of sorts because it gives him a chance to stake a claim on more prominent role. It doesn't mean that he is above playing games for the U21s but that he has immense potential which can be utilized now.
We have Rooney and Martial as our two senior strikers and they have both 'skipped the steps' you are putting so much import on, that's not my point though, but that having so few strikers present opportunities for Rashford and Wilson to stake a claim for that third striker role whilst, obviously getting games at U21 level.

964~~~
Needs to stay and be a no 2/3 or loaned to a premier league side as a no1.
Also Rooney needs to be moved on.

965~~~
Seems about right to me. Relegating him back to the U21's as a permanent fixture won't do him any favours. Being in or around the first team will give his development so much more.

966~~~
If we truly believe in youths then its time to show it. Lets invest our dosh in wingers who ooze creativity and goals and lets trust Martial and Rashford upfront.

967~~~
I'm not even talking about goals because believe it or not, we have only focused on developing his finishing in the last 2 seasons after deciding to convert him into striker.Reading some acting as if he's some sort of natural poacher and that's it is hilarious.

968~~~
Right on, for all Woodward, Fergie, LVG's posturing about youth Rashford's case will show exactly how much the academy and youth products are really the cornerstone of our club's future. Also when Rooney is back we will see how deliberate LVG was when giving these kids chances.

969~~~
He was more of an attacking midfielder at u16s and below wasn't he?

I certainly remember watching him for England schoolboys as a number 10, where he seemed more of a playmaker than a goalscorer

970~~~
Dumping back down to the U21's wont do him any good, he's more than merited his place in the first team squad.

971~~~
Are we talking about from the fans perspective? Or are we talking about from a coach/managerial perspective? Because the fans need to be patient regardless. He's 18 and he's clearly not ready to lead the line for a top club yet. He took a chance being 7th choice player. As much as I say well played to the lad, that is not the ideal scenario to be "taking your chance" where there is a transfer window, possible manager re-shuffle and players returning which will put him further down the pecking order for next season. He still won't be in his peak for another 6-8 years there is plenty of time to be patient and give him first team football on loan or blood him in the u21's (as he hasn't even played a game for them yet).

In my opinion we probably want four forwards. Two main senior forwards (Martial is much better on the left and also not ready to play as a forward we'd be better off declaring him for the left and gaining an extra proper striker), one main utility backup forward and then the fourth sport be for another utility you can keep happy or you continue to bring through a young guy into the mix (who ideally will get league cup games and say 10-15 appearances of 30 minutes off the bench a season, more if he is lucky).

It presented no chance for Wilson, if he was not loaned and stayed fit we'd have not seen Rashford at all. So part of developing young players is knowing when to play them, when to move them on loan and when to keep the champing at the bit for minutes by holding them back just that little bit. Quite clearly Rashford needs to go on loan for a full season next year or to the 21's as my guess is Wilson will return into the mix and Will Keane who is also technically "ahead" of him in the order will have to either be moved on (likely) or will stay ahead of him. The manager situation presents further webs for him to be caught in. So I think a loan will be the safest bet for a lot of minutes. A full responsibility role where he plays 50 games a season will be perfect for him at 18 at his stage of development. He isn't going to get that at United regardless and he is only 18 remember.

972~~~
Why would we deomte him back to U21 football where they hardly ever play while giving his spot to Wilson who hasn't done anything notable at senior level? He took his shot and is rightfully ahead of the others kids.

973~~~
Black players tend to be fast and powerful. No big deal. It's in the genes.

King was quite the talent as a teenager. I saw a lot of Benzema in him. Obviously he hasn't been able to transfer his goals to senior level, despite having the physical tools necessary to flourish at this level. He is a threat but needs to improve his end product. He's never going to give a defender an easy game, but should be making better use of his qualities. He's done really well this season though, I'm happy for him. A good signing by Howe.

974~~~
Even after Rooney comes back, he is going to come out of the bench for the first two games. So Rashford should start even then. And if keeps scoring he should stay in the team and the manager can drop Lingard and put Rooney in the #10 role if he wants to.

975~~~
What do you think of Ashley Fletcher? He's been doing well on loan for Barnsley, just scored his fifth goal for them at Wembley in the final of the Johnstones paint trophy last weekend. Barnsley won

976~~~
Generalise much?

977~~~
Waiting for thread to get derailed, 3... 2... 1...

978~~~
Josh King, perhaps alongside Rossi, was the most impressive forward I can recall seeing in recent times in our youth set up. I really thought he'd make it here.

979~~~
Blimey it just goes to show how football can divide opinion. Never rated King, a decent athlete who could play a bit. Nowhere near Rossi. Ebanks Blake, Campbell and Keane looked better to me as well.

980~~~
Same, never rated King but to be honest i never really rated Campbell or Ebanks Blake either......Rossi is the standout player obviously, easily the best player that we had in academy after Ravel. 
Keane was also special, i do rate Wilson very highly and also rated Fabian Brandy.
To categorize them, i would say Rossi would go into special players bracket, Will and Willo into good enough for United and Brandy into maybe bracket.

981~~~
Still can't beleive we let Rossi go. So out of character for SAF. Only his injuries have prevented that from being a disastrous decision.

Yeah the more I think about this whole Josh King comparison the more bizzare it seems.

982~~~
We're going to have to make a big decision in regards to what we do with Rashford next season. I don't think he will start, but I still want him to get loads of games, in order for him to keep progressing. 

Personally, I would move Rooney to number 10, keep Martial on the wing, and get in a first choice striker. People are calling for Lukaku, but at only 22, it will slow down the development of Rashford. Ideally, we should probably be looking at a striker around 27/28, so when he gets to about 30, we can slowly start to faze him out, hoping Rashford will be ready to be first choice at 21/22. Of course we'd still have Martial too.

983~~~
I think he's at the right level and should look to make the move permanent. He could find himself up the leagues with time. Afobe did the same.

984~~~
Care to debate your point?

985~~~
yes its a ridiculously ignorant thing to say.

986~~~
Are you one of the rare black guys who's slow?

988~~~
Are you one of the incredibly common guys who's from 1850?

989~~~
I'm really curious about what else is in his box. He's been a bit lucky with the goals so far I would say. I really wish to see something special or he's just going to be another fast guy like Lingard.

990~~~

Also,  Rashford is ace! But he'll still be dropped for the Wazza.

993~~~
wow youre a knob.

994~~~
I assume you are joking since very few black players playing in European football are <i>African American</i> and it would take more than 300 years for major genetic differences to emerge. How does one develop genes for fast running through working all day in the hot ass sun on a plantation? lol

995~~~
Seriously? 

For 18, the lads has shown a lot to his game. His hold up play, link up, movement (when to drop, when to run in behind or make a decoy run) and intelligence around the box is of a player way beyond his years, in my opinion. 

I also fail to see how his goals have been lucky. Midtjylland he scored two very good goals, being in the right place at the right time. That's something that can't be taught, and something we missed in the first leg.

Against Arsenal it was the same. Being in the right place at the right time. Two very well taken goals. 

Against City, yes, Demechilis could have defended a lot better for his goal, but the quickness of thought and finish when he was one on one with Hart was impressive.

996~~~
That's my point!  He says "black" but in reality Africans in Africa are as different physically as anywhere else in the world. The only people you could use the argument of genes with is African Americans.

1001~~~
Marcus is quality.

1002~~~
Last time I looked at the GB Athletics team their fastest sprinters were black but not <i>African American</i>. Same with team Jamaica, and any country in the Carribean. Anyhew, back to the thread, I see Rashford more as a Jermaine Defoe type than a Fernando Torres superstar type. Kinda like Smalling is more the Wes Brown type than Rio, Vidic or Stam type; but still its early days....

1003~~~
By African American I'm referring to the descendents of former slaves of which most people from the Caribbean are a part of.

1004~~~
That's not today's definition of African American I'm afraid!  It refers solely to American citizens with ancestry from Black ethnic groups in Africa!

1005~~~
OK bro,  I'm wrong.  Back to the thread.

1006~~~
That's all good, but I'm looking a bit forward into the future. Marcus need to show more than just that to be in the plans. A top club will ask for qualities above average. If you look at Welbeck he's competent enough to play at a HIGH level - but it wasn't good enough for us. Just draw your eyes to a club like Athletico and watch names like Torres, Falcao(back then), Forlán (when he came good), Aguero, Griezman, Villa, Mandzukic, Diego Costa, Vieri. Do you see any pattern in the philosophy?

1007~~~
He kept drifting wide too often today I felt, but it was difficult as we didn't have an attacking shape, just him in acres of space with Martial the only red shirt in sight.

1008~~~
LVG will probably dump him from the side now, he is as quick to disgard the youngsters as he is to play them.

1009~~~
I have no issue with him drifting out wide cos you see strikers do that which drags away a defender to leave space for a midfielder / second striker / winger to move into. 

Rooney will be forced back soon and will take his place unfortunately.

1010~~~
Yep. Varela is nowhere to be seen after the Liverpool game.

1011~~~
We can't create chances for our strikers so there's no point in even playing him. You can't rely on Martial to skin three players to stand a chance of scoring a goal, it's lunacy. It makes you wonder what we actually do in training.

1012~~~
Surely the fact that we fell apart after he went off will be in his favour?

1013~~~
It wasn't until TFM went off and was replaced with Darmian did United go completely off the rails.

Rashford didn't do well and Young did equal to Rashford, but that wasn't too difficult to do.

1014~~~
Rashford wasn't getting much out of the game in honesty. Substituting him was an acceptable move, but the rest shall not be spoken about.

1015~~~
Most do not, however, you can see that this positional nuance is not in our game plan. Whenever the strikers have done it this season it appears nobody moves to compensate. Van Gaal through Rooney has revealed he does not want the striker to move from the top position.

I'd much prefer we allow some fluidity for players to drop and drift wide to receive the ball and open up the play.

Still, I will continue to say. The attacking woes are all system based and it doesn't matter who is playing there and Rashford quite clearly isn't ready yet.

1016~~~
Looked the rookie he is today. Which is fair enough.

Hopefully Mourinho keeps him in and around the squad though.

1017~~~
Spurs had nobody to occupy their CBs or to worry about in terms of defending except Martial (who was out wide). Rashford didnt have his best game (and tbh, I think he needs a rest) but it was such a strange substitution to make.

Or the sub wasnt that strange, more so not changing it around.

1018~~~
I thought he played poor today but subbed him off for a winger during half time was a really stupid idea

1019~~~
Exactly, it's not like Kane had a stormer either. I hope his confidence hasn't been LvG'd

1020~~~
so LVG smeared him against the wall at half time for not running in behind enough. Might be him done now for the season

1021~~~
One thing I've observed is he is quite rough when dealing with youngsters.

1022~~~
Have to disagree, the reason Rashford was ineffective is that he had ZERO service or support. What exactly changed when we put Young up top, NOTHING. The actual cause of the problems were in midfield.

1023~~~
By not strange, I meant, it may have worked if we then swapped it around, put Martial up top and put Young as Left Wing (which would have made it less strange). Putting Young up top was ridiculous cos he wasnt even up top <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1024~~~
Fair point, but to me even that wouldn't have worked. The sub should have been Carrick off Herrera on, Mata in the middle Lingard out wide.

EDIT: The Young thing was almost as bad as Nick Powell

1025~~~
Needs rest, there's too much expectations from him at the moment, and after that brilliant start to United career it's easily to forget he's just a kid.

1026~~~
I'm not sure why he was (according to papers) laying into the poor lad in the dressing room. He wasn't hugely involved but it didn't look like United set up to attack. He did pretty much the same as any striker in the world would do in the same circumstance. When your creative options are a right wing back Mata, and and triple marked Martial it's going to be difficult to get a look in at goal. 
I hope he starts on Wednesday and isn't dropped for stupid reasons. 
Wouldn't shock me if Young is up front again to be honest.

1027~~~
I expect that Marcus will be frozen out for the rest of the season now - the Adnan treatment.  Rooney back anyway

1028~~~
Like poor McNair, LVG man managments skills are almost none excistent.

1029~~~
Didn't most people say this when he got taken off last time? He'll still get plenty of game time in the next 3 games.

I have no problem with a manager highlighting the shortcomings of a player who want to improve. Should he say he did a good job so as to not hurt his feelings? He should take note and get on with it.

1030~~~
I understand that and I am sure Rashford will feature plenty it's just after the way it seems with LVG at times, like he doesn't have much leeway when it comes to mistakes.

1031~~~
Probably, a lot of players have one bad match and they're out. Especially the younger ones.

1032~~~
Yes, fair enough, but surely he should have told him at half time, outlined what he wanted him to do differently and then give him a chance to do that.  If, after 60 mins he was still not doing it, then sub him

1033~~~
He could also get his fat lazy arse off his seat during the game and tell him to run in behind as well

1034~~~
That as well

1035~~~
So we've basically got the professional equivalent of a matchday thread poster in charge of the club. Ffs

1036~~~
I do see your point, but it's not a bad attitude to have IMO. I see the argument though.

1037~~~
Yeah, true. That is a little rash, LVG gets a little trigger happy on the subs in big games. I do see the reasoning behind the sub though. If someone doesn't do what they're told for 45 minutes, after planning all week for it, probably likely that they won't change if you tell them at half time.

1038~~~
What he is wondering is "what happened to a simple half term hairdryer, followed by the player getting 15-20 or so minutes to redeem himself?" It seems you have 1 strike and you are hauled off which is incredible pressure on the players. No wonder they are shite scared to try stuff. In more ways than I can count, LVG is the polar opposite to Ferguson which is a problem. From "go out and excite me" to "make mistakes and you are off at half time, relegated to under 21's and sold like Di Maria."

1039~~~
I do see the point, but I still argue it probably would make little difference with this lot. At least Ashley Young showed he's willing to follow orders.

Edit: Kind of made that not about Rashford. My point being, I don't think he was going do what he was originally told to do, just because he got shouted at, at half time. He'll get another chance with the games coming thick and fast and can take it then. When you've got a sub that you trust (Young has been actually a rare consistent performer when not injured and professional), you should use him.

1040~~~
Fergie 9/10 knew when to put his arm round a player or when to give him the hairdryer where as LVG looks to have 1 default option.

1041~~~
this is a great point, he actually chooses to do nothing when can see what's needed. Then uses halftime to tell them what they did wrong, feckwit

1042~~~
It's about confidence building. Getting subbed at half time repeatedly and you get a Memphis. Rashford is still a little kid. If he starts the next game, try and hazard a guess what may be at the back of his mind. I must do XYZ right in this half or I'll be off at half time again." It's the fear mentality as opposed to encouragement. It hinders your footballing instincts. <b>Love</b> and I think another said Van Gaal doesn't encourage or speak to the youngsters and that it is mainly Giggs and Joyce. Varela said he is difficult to speak to, especially when you are used to speaking to someone like Ferguson. The youngsters will just be randomly selected and even then, they got to get changed with other kids and get hauled off at half time if they are <i>having a bad half</i>. In other words its "tough <b>Love</b>" no pun intended, but in my view they are treated like shite rather than an arm around the shoulder. We all need an arm around the shoulder every now and again don't we?

1043~~~
Mourinho has the same problem tbh

1044~~~
Really? Some of the biggest egos (Zlatan) love Mourinho. He used to text him every day and told his wife, she has one job, keep him fed etc. I agree he has fallen out with some however I also know that he can be sympathetic. Van Gaal just seems like a tyrant

1045~~~
I'm talking about when there is an issue, not when things are rosey (as they always were with Zlatan). See Real Madrid and Chelsea x2

1046~~~
I see your point and I guess we'll have to take the risk as there are no managers with the man management skills of daddy ferguson. But then again some players said they would've died for Jose. who would for Van Gaal? Jose seems a bit more easy going than Van Gaal. Even though Hazard was disinterested, he still got picked more than not.

1047~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1048~~~
Think that is a poor example, he's just been fiercely underwhelming and he gave him countless chances.

Is that bad? he never hauls them off for trying, it's either when they are doing the complete opposite of what he asked them or simply lack of concentration, ie Varela. Both I'd rather not encourage. Let's not forget these players were never really first team options anyway.

That being said, I understand where you are coming from, there are certainly times to be a little bit more forgiving and not act the way van gaal has. You do have to remember he is fiercely underperforming, even by his standards, so I imagine the idea of comforting someone who has pissed all over his laid plans doesn't appeal. Again, he should be able to see past that sometimes.

1049~~~
Don't get me wrong I am all for hiring Mourinho, and yes Van Gaal has top players who sing his praises. Muller and Robben for example.

1050~~~
He has also hauled Valencia, Darmian, and Rojo off early so its not like he only does it to the kids. If you play shite, you get taken off.

1051~~~
Funny how "Jose seems a bit more easy going", yet completely alienated his entire squad post-Eva fiasco, which cost him his job and destabilized Chelsea on and off the pitch. Jose and LVG are both successful managers with their own baggage, same as any other winning manager.

Mourinho created a great atmosphere at Inter Milan, obviously it was extremely helpful he was winning and won the Treble with them. But let's not kid ourselves. Mourinho is ruthless and will do anything to win. If Mourinho is manager, he will not have any issue selling Mata for a second time.

1052~~~
Feck Mata anyway I'd sell him too

1053~~~
Me also

1054~~~
when he's in the game he's dangerous, maybe the best piece of play came from him when he dropped deep which is interesting..

1055~~~
lingard, fellaini, rooney, et al say hello.

1056~~~
Great first half, the way he skinned Antonio was great.

1057~~~
Wow

1058~~~
feck!

1059~~~
His finishing is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous.

1060~~~
Our barely legal superstar

1061~~~
That was simply top class.

1062~~~
Josh King <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1063~~~
We have a couple of gems in him and Martial.

1064~~~
Barely legal for what? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1065~~~
Such a special player.  Not just ability but the balls to do the things he does.

1066~~~
Best game so far for us. Lovely finish.

1067~~~
He's never had trouble striking a football at youth level, was only a matter of time..

1068~~~
Fantastic finish.

1069~~~
Rooney is going to the Euros ahead of this kid...

1070~~~
Bus driving.

1071~~~
He's got that natural instinct of a finisher which you either have or you haven't. That's why I think he can be a genuine star player (the first we've brought through in 20 years) rather than a good squad player like Welbeck (and I like Danny).

1072~~~
Sex tape

1073~~~
This boy...

1074~~~
Crazy isn't it...

1075~~~
Top class finish and brilliant game as a whole. Skinned some WHU defenders and scored a belter. Can't ask for more.

1076~~~
Seriously where has this lad come from? Had Martial not been injured against midgetland he probably wouldn't have even played for us yet...crazy

1077~~~
Had Keane not got injured too.....amazing really.

1078~~~
Really really good game from him and an even better finish. I'm sure he'll get yanked at halftime again next time we don't get the ball to him though.

1079~~~
Goals against Arsenal, City and West Ham.

Safe to say he's no Macheda. RIP James Wilson.

1080~~~
Gold.

1081~~~
Great point

Seriously though where has he came from? How long has he been playing under 21 football?

1082~~~
Who was it that compared him to Josh King? Crazy.

He's got really good feet. A lot of tall, younger players flail around the place but he's quick and precise with his footwork.

1083~~~
If Rooney replaces him up top I'll have a fit. He puts him to shame.

1084~~~
About a handful of games. He was pretty much fast-tracked through that into the first team via the U18s.

1085~~~
There isn't a weakness I can spot in his game. Pace, finishing and technique. Also calm on the ball. The sky's the limit with this guy.

1086~~~
Finished like Josh King

1087~~~
Thanks

1088~~~
Not long and it's kind of hard to remember with the youth teams playing at weird times. He's surprised me I got to be honest. I think Wilson and Keane could be great too but this kid is impressing. I think the goal away at City and this goal tonight...show a real quality because they are important goals. With Rooney coming back, it would have been easy for him to go into his shell a bit so it looks good.

1089~~~
Wilson won't be sold - but like Rashford has the benefit of being able to play out wide. We've some good young players.

1090~~~
Lovely Goal. Him and Martial have such a great understanding. They also bring others into play. I think Herrera might thrive playing as a No 10 with them. He seems to get a better understanding with them than Mata.

1091~~~
That was a stonkingly good goal. And a very mature performance.

1092~~~
His goal will get most of the coverage and it was a superb bit of play and a cracking finish, but his all round game was very good tonight, he was calm under pressure, made good runs, linked well and worked his socks off.

1093~~~
I think he's a future 7 for us.  The fans love him and he's a wonderful mix of determination and talent.

1094~~~
The goal was obviously great but that stop and go in the box in the first half was even better I thought, just lacked the finish at the end of it.

1095~~~
Glad to see he stuck to his task today and had an absolute stormer. Happy to have someone able to come on so he can rest, even if that is Rooney.

1096~~~
fraizer campbell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1097~~~
It is funny that if Rooney had not gotten injuried, we would have never seen Rashford play this season. Moreover, Will Keane aswell because I recalled even him was ahead of him. It is interesting how things came together for him to start for United.

1098~~~
Same could be said of TFM really. Infact Mensah was even behind Tuanzebe if I am not mistaken, until he got injured.

1099~~~
He plays with the type of energy and nervelessness I haven't seen since Giggs broke through. Just seems made for this level.

1100~~~
He is fecking 18! just hope he keeps improving, I think it was his best all round game today.. Glad we gave him chance, I don't think under Fergie we would see anything like this, he would probably play rafael/young upfront, Van Gaal deserves a bit credit for it even he's just a bit lucky doing so, all the injuries and small squad however as I said he could still play some senior players out of position and adjust the formation like Fergie would do..

1101~~~
He's not pulling up any trees in The Championship. If he can't get games there, he should be worried.

Unless he pulls of a Kane, his future isn't looking bright. At least his United career. I know there is a player in him.

1102~~~
<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/> He played Rafael when he was 18 at RB in a very very important PL game as well if I am not mistaken. Fergie might not have had a small squad, but he always gives opportunities to talented youngsters when the time is right. It's just his approach is more methodical to van Gaal's "Young Lad Deep Pool End" strategy.

1103~~~
Wasn't he injured for a while now ?? From what I understand, Wilson is still higher rated than Rashford. Only thing is Wilson sort of tends to go missing for a large chunk of the game before producing a few good moments. Rashford is much more hardworking.

1104~~~
Man what a goal..  Great talent on our hands..

1105~~~
if you're not mistaken, I am not sure if Fergie would play freshly seventeen striker upfront when he played barely two games for U21 before, he played there smaling and sheasy, wes brown as well, I think Vangle gave debuts to more academy players than Fergie did over his last 10 years, and more starts followed, I am not counting Ravel morrison/tunnincliffe.. one minute contribution in a cup game

1106~~~
Wow, just wow! I'm just as excited to see what he can progress into than I am with Martial. The lad looks very special. The finish was top class. Super.

1107~~~
Yea, and I can think of others aswell. Those injuries seem to have helped our season, which is a strange thing to say

1108~~~
Wilson isn't as good with his back to goal as Rashford. He's stronger and has shown a goalscoring instinct that Wilson hasn't been able to transfer to the first team.

Wilson is a bit like Vardy. He needs space to run into.

Wilson was sick on the pitch in January and hasn't wormed his way back into their starting eleven since then. Only 3 starts since January 1st.

1109~~~
Hopefully he'll be our Harry Kane.

1110~~~
One of Willo's main attributes is his hard work. He has even been criticized for running around too much and not knowing how to conserve his energy which leads to him gassing out too early.

1111~~~
Reminds me of a young Michael Owen.

1112~~~
Loan starts don't mean shit, 99% of clubs are going to play their own player over a young kids who isn't their own.

1113~~~
I wouldn't worry about what he's doing in the championship. He's had a few niggles/sickness. Look at Harry Kanes record prior to last season when he was in the championship. He's 20 so still developing. We just have to be paitent and see how he develops but I think the kids this season have been given a great boost. I would expect Wilson to push on once he's stronger. I'm sure Rashford will inspire him

1114~~~
Remember carrick at centreback? Not to mention that blackburn game, SAF got a lot more conservative w.r.t youth as he got older.

1115~~~
Danny Welbeck <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <span style="color: #ffffff">white text</span>

1116~~~
Beat me to it.

1117~~~
New Josh King.

1118~~~
They loaned him in to help gain promotion. He was starting games regularly. They didn't loan him in for a laugh. He's scored Premier League goals and came with a prolific record at U21 level. 

Bamford was a key player for Middlesbrough last season and MKD the season before.

He was sent there to develop and he isn't.

1119~~~
We had a run of games with fletcher at CB too and also berbatov finished one game there, wasnt from the start though <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> was quite safety first in his late years..

1120~~~
Needs to stay fit first

1121~~~
Rooney will bench him.

1122~~~
Scholesey knew. He knows everything

1123~~~
Stunning finish. Very positive game.

1124~~~
That's because Fergie always had a bigger squad to choose from which I already mentioned. But even then, he gave debuts to the likes of Macheda, Giusspi Rossi, Pique, Wellbeck  all of whom were still teenagers at that point. Pique even played a very important role in the two UCL Semifinal legs against Barcelona. How much more faith needs to be shown than that ? When he believes the time is right, he trusts those young players. He also listens to the coaching staff a lot and trusts their judgement. I liked Fergie's method to be honest. The idea of easing a young player into the highest level seems a lot more safer than just throwing them in and hoping they come good. Ofocurse, for van Gaal it has come good, but I do think Fergie deserves a lot of praise as well.

Hmm, but I think Rashford is also being helped by having someone like Martial next to him. They have such a telepathic understanding. When Wilson played, it was next to van Persie and Rooney, who were hardly ever on the same wavelength post Fergie.

You misunderstood my point. I mean to say from an attacking perspective, he doesn't really do much for most of the game like hold up the ball well, drag markers out wide etc. But when he suddenly decides to turn it up a notch, he just blazes through and leaves a mark.

1125~~~
Remember Pique at CB against Barcelona in a UCL semifinal ? Both legs. I thought Pique would bottle it, but he was amazing. I don't think he got conservative. The reason for not giving Pogba a game is well documented. From that youth group, nobody else has really made it. I don't know what happened to Macheda. Then guys like Larnell Cole just never flourished (Was supposedly highly rated at the time). I just think he didn't really have that good a group of youth to work with. He even mentioned Lingard would come good by age 23 and he wasn't wrong was he ? He even handed Januzaj a jersey number before retiring.

Edit: He also preferred 18 year old Rafael to the veteran Gary Neville after his return from injury. Even sold guys like Wes Brown and O'shea shortly after that.

1126~~~
The U18 last season and the U21 this season, I believe. He was good with the U18 but it's hard to judge the attackers because they are always moving.

1127~~~
His goal obviously speaks for itself. 

But his pass to Lingaard that created that chance was such an impressive peice of play and gives me even more hope. 

The kid can play though.

1128~~~
Was that his 6th for us? In 11 games or something? He could easily have been our top scorer. I bet Will Keane is gutted though, this is all down to his injury.

1129~~~
Rashford. Jesus Lord... 

Definitely not a flash in the pan, what a player!

1130~~~

1131~~~

1132~~~
LVG told him what to do

1133~~~
I'm starting to think can Rashford save us a fortune in the summer rather than splashing out on a big name striker?

1134~~~
I think the idea should be to bin Rooney and get another striker if possible.

1135~~~
Even taking credit for that. Does his narcissism know no bounds?

<span style="color: #ffffff">Hue hue</span>

1136~~~
This.

1137~~~
Eh?? He didn't play in either game
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1138~~~
Agree on Rooney but if we bring in a first choice striker, say Lukaku, where does that leave Rashford?  On the bench or on loan. I wouldn't mind a short term player like Ibra

1139~~~
Bin Rooney, a season or two of Ibrahimovic with Rashford behind him, then let Ibra feck off to Miami.

1140~~~
No he didn't. We moved our first choice RB that season, Wes Brown to CB and played Owen Hargreaves at RB.

1141~~~
Was great leading the line but can't help but feel that he's no Ashley Young

1142~~~
Same here.

1143~~~
We will have three first choice strikers next year hopefully. Someone new, Rashford and Martial. Plenty of games for all as Martial and Rashford can both play wide.

1144~~~
This looks like more of the unwarranted extreme lobbying for James Wilson I have seen for a while. Rashford had scored 4 of his 6 goals before he had even played a minute with Martial, so that point doesn't wash. Wilson hasn't really done it. But let's not imply that Rashford has come into a perfectly settled team and attack. He came in when we were at our thinnest, and even carried the attack for a while.

There is absolutely no basis at all for Wilson to be considered ahead of him. He's older and has not shown himself to be a Premier League centre forward yet in my opinion, let alone a United one. Rashford is on the brink of the England squad you would think, Wilson has never gotten close, and even despite Marcus recent run, has probably still played more games for us out of the two.

Keane, for me, should not be in the conversation at all. I accept he was once looking a major talent but that was 4 years ago or more. He hasn't shown he can cut it as a Championship striker after about 4 attempts, yet people are still seeing a a United player in him, at almost 23. He'll be gone in the summer, as he should be.

1145~~~
Me neither. Maybe that's why we're interested in him (if the reports are to be believed).

1146~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7368730.stm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7368730.stm</a>

Didnt play...

1147~~~
Hope Mourinho uses him. To be fair, he does use young players if they show quality. Zouma played a lot for instance. Hopefully he puts TFM and Rashford as part of first team.

1148~~~
He has no fear. He will be hit and miss, but hes more hit than anything. Hope we do right by him. It would be great to get an experienced striker for him to learn from though. Somebody like how we got Larrson.

1149~~~
That goal was certainly reminiscent of Owen. I would say that Rashford is a little more skilful than Owen but MO was one hell of a goal scorer and a true big game player. I hope Rashford can hit the same level as Owen did.

1150~~~
He is verging on becoming an even bigger sensation than Martial this season. Would be criminal to bench him at this point.

1151~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> the revisionism in full flow then

1152~~~
When it comes to the comparison between Rashford and Wilson, as much as I like Marcus you have to take note of the amount of starts he's got compared to Wilson. Wilson was restricted to a lot of five and ten minute cameos and it's hard to expect much in that scenario. Even Rashford hasn't proven he can come on for a few minutes and score, although he doesn't need to as he's been able to start games and get accustomed to the match pace, something Wilson often wasn't allowed to do. 

I rate both and believe they both have big futures at United as Wilson matches Rashford in most attributes, if not betters him in some. If Rashford next season was to have an indifferent spell on loan at a Championship club would he all of a sudden be deemed not good enough? Some on here are way too quick to write people off. What a goal by Marcus though, as <a class="username" data-user="29933, @jb8521" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/29933/">@jb8521</a> mentioned on twitter he's scored a near identical goal to that at under 18 level so it's been in his locker. Great to see and I love how unfazed he is in his performances, almost as though he's unaware/not fussed by how much rides on some of these matches which is great.

1153~~~
Wilson played with some very creative players though, and there was a higher optimism back then.

Rashford came in during a time of crisis and lifted the team. It's not like he was playing with van persie, di María and in form players like Young and Herrera who were playing really well this time last year. He came into a mess and thrived in a pile of shit, which is what impresses me the most.

Imagine him in a settled side with more creativity.

I just hope he stays grounded and doesn't act the fool during the summer break. The fame, money, sponsors, women and following are headed his way.

1154~~~
Amazing he keeps scoring from the very few chances we actually create per game.

1155~~~
I get what you're saying but it'd be really interesting to see how many actual minutes Rashford has compared to Wilson. Also the side Wilson was in last season was only marginally better than our team now, as far as performances go. I rate both of them I just think people have not been very understanding with Wilson, unfair to assume he might not have done what Rashford's been doing given the same opportunities, because Wilson hasn't been given anywhere near the same level of opportunity Marcus has. I just hope he gets another opportunity. Not one to overhype young players but I really foresaw Rooney breaking Sir Bobby's record and Wilson going and breaking himself years down the line. Obviously not likely now but he has it in him no doubt to be a really top player. I know people like to play down the significance of youth football but most that have watched him previously believe he has what it takes so we'll see if he gets the chance, time will tell though.

As far as Marcus staying grounded, I wouldn't worry too much about that. Seems to have good people around him and several coaches have noted his humility even after his crazy breakthrough. Of course you never know but I think he'll be fine.

1156~~~
At this level starts for the likes of Wilson and Rashford are at a premium so from the little chances one gets its imperative that they utilize them to earn the manager's trust. Rashford did and Wilson didn't meaning that Rashford now has some credit in the bank which would come handy when the tough times inevitably come. I have no doubt that Wilson will get another chance and when it comes he must take it inorder for him to bring himself back into the reckoning otherwise he will be confined to Rashford's shadow for the foreseeable future.

1157~~~
Man, I thought Wilson was going to become a goalscoring sensation like Messi and Ronaldo. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He was so clinical and sharp at U21, U19 and U18 level. He could glide with the ball and finish from nearly any angle once inside the box.

So I'm genuinely shocked to see how his career is turning out. The perfect debut. He's still young though. A different system would suit him at United. We're playing with more width than we did last season when Young was our only outlet. Martial and Lingard have improved things.

1158~~~
I wonder why Rashford got more starts tha  Wilson? There is a clear difference in how their first-team performances have gone. Wilson,  despite being the older, has looked like a young kid who is u der cooked and not ready. And if Rashford is indifferent on loan next season, it will not be the same as Wilson,  simply because we will remember that he has already shown he can play to an extremely high level in the United first team.

I also think it's wrong to be putting Wilson attributes above Rashford as on the large, we are basing it on youth games. Wilson has not been a youth team player for about two years, these attributes that are often championed are still things he has rarely shown in first team footy.

I do not intend to write Wilson off, but I do think people are too quick to count his achievements or credentials before he has shown it at a proper level. The fact is, even if he is kept this summer, if he plays next season as he has played for the last two, he will likely be sold as not good enough, so he has a lot to prove, more so than Rashford at this stage. No matter how you play for the youth, top flight is sink or swim, nobody is promised it. At the moment,  Wilson can't possibly be considered to be swimming at the level required at United. Of course,  it is too early to call time, but soon it won't be,  and if he is still a United player at the time, it would be down to him having started to play much better than he has done over the last few seasons, not because he used to be prolific in the reserves years ago. Fosu Mensah won't play our next game because he was good for our reserves 6 more the ago, it will be because he was good for the first team in the last game. That’s how it works, players need to take their chances, but over the years, I have generally just seen posters making various excuses for players they like.

1159~~~
Willo: 677 minutes over 20 appearances, 4 goals
Rashford: 861 minutes over 11 apps, 6 goals

1160~~~
Yeah I agree, it's all about timing, and it was perfect for Rashford. I understand why Wilson didn't start as many games as Rashford has but I think last season we could all see RVP was on the wane and Wilson was consistently showing more in his brief appearances than Van Persie was in the preceding 80/85 mins which led to many calling for James to start but it never happened unfortunately. Next season is no doubt crucial for him and we'll have to see what he does.

It's crazy to think Wilson's debut was two seasons ago now. I'd really like to see Wilson return to us amongst a better team. I genuinely believe there's enough room for both him and Rashford and that they could save us a truckload of money (not that we have a need to save really) for the foreseeable future.

1161~~~
All I'll say on that is Fosu-Mensah is a unfair example as strikers are judged much more harshly than players in any other position, Wilson's all round game wasn't bad when he got opportunities he just didn't score many, and it's not as though he was missing sitters or something.  I also don't think it's wrong as someone who's seen both thoroughly to say that Wilson matches Rashford's attributes as it's not as though he's shown nothing at all at first team level, there was definitely promise shown.

Thanks a lot mate. Think some will be surprised to see this as their memory of Wilson's chances last season seem distorted. Pretty much exactly as I thought it'd be, more appearances but all pretty much brief cameos in which he wasn't able to do much. Yet some say Wilson's had ample opportunity already...

1162~~~
Explain please.

1163~~~
Willo needs to improve his fitness and playing with his back to the goal.His finishing is good even at senior level though, as he shown on his loan move.His ability to run with the ball at pace is very useful but he needs to be in those position to get more of the ball.Rashford's all-round game is better and he has an incredible touch.

1164~~~
what a strike!

1165~~~
Think he's got a bit of the Aguero skill set. The burst of pace to take out a couple of defenders and the awareness of what's around him. When he's fully physically developed he'll be absolutely brilliant.

Just watched the goal back and in Martin Tyler's commentary he called him Lingard <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1166~~~
I'm actually very skeptical about his chances here (not rational, just feel like it), but he does his best to prove me wrong. Hopefully he'll continue to improve

1167~~~
The biggest benefactor of Rooney's injury and LVG's 'lack' of planning for the injury. Wilson had to challenge with RVP, Rooney and Falcao. Its really not fair.

1168~~~
I don't agree that Wilson's all round game was impressive in his games with us. My impression was generally that of a headless chicken, and he looked nervous and uncoordinated most of the time. He just didn't look a special talent. Rashford has done. That’s not to say Wilson will not still look special for us, but I am pointing out that at this point t, we are discussing one player who has done and one who has not. My issue is how often Wilson is discussed on here as of he already is a player who has shown these capabilities with the team.

Rashford has shown what a young striker with great potential should look like here. Martial showed it. Rooney showed it at 18. That is the standard. Wilson also has designs on being g our main striker like them. Why should he be I  the argument if he cannot reach the levels for us that others have?

1169~~~
Wilson though rarely pushed for anything more than that. Had he shown more promise or something we would have played them more as lingard, CBJ and all have shown. I think Wilson started for us ahead of falcao against Liverpool last season but did very little. In contrast rashford led the line vs city and scored a goal. Rashford has got more chance because he earned it. Imo Wilson is yet to show anything at senior level (his debut aside). And I don't mean goals. Just general play. I can remember the QPR away game last year when he had a run against them (not the goal but before that) but that's about it iirc.

1170~~~
Rashford certainly seems to have a sense of occasion from what we've seen so far. I know it's a bit of cliche but he just looks like a United player, fearless and tireless, he just looks likes he's having fun out there and it was a terrific response to the reported bollocking he reportedly got on Sunday.

1171~~~
Goal of the season for us,  fecking ledge moment! Love it <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1172~~~
Yep, when he's on song, beating people and moving well and quickly it reminds me of watching Giggs when he was a kid (different kind of player I know) and what Ferguson said about him - '(he) floated over the ground like a cocker spaniel chasing a piece of silver paper in the wind' just the sheer joy and abandon of it is great to watch. Really hope he makes it here, there's never any guarantees.

1173~~~
Says more about how few we've scored that there hasn't really been any "great" goals that I can think of, that this one, though it was a really good goal, is our best this season.

1174~~~
All of his goals have come in huge games for us... Not a bad start to his senior career at all. It hasn't been by luck either, he has good movement, knows how to go past players with some skill and use his pace brilliantly, and showed today how good of a finisher he can be. We'll see if he truly develops into a good player or if this is just a good patch of form, but with his height and pace, if he bulks up, he can really develop into a beast of a striker. Just think of him, but with a lot more muscle so he can hold off defenders hold up the ball really well along with still be so good. He's really thin right now but that's because he's so young. Give him a couple of seasons to bulk up, which isn't needed for everyone but in his case would really make a difference I think.

1175~~~

1176~~~
Holy Mother of God.  Just now watching the game...Rashford's goal is pure class.  That's the kind of goal talk about when we discuss "chances created" in other threads.  Did Rashford really have a "chance" before he squared himself up for the shot?  No.  It was a nice pass to feed him but Rashford did all the work to create something out of nothing.  THAT is what we've been missing all season.

1177~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Sorry my bad. For some weird reason I was so certain he played in the semifinal. Then was it the previous round ? Coz I remember Fergie specifically saying he would play since one of our CBs was not available. He was still good though. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1178~~~
Yeah, but his method is also a little frightening to be honest. Last year after McNair's performance against West Ham, people were hailing him. Then van Gaal said he could be our RB for the next 10 years and many agreed. He had one awful half that year and hasn't even been talked about since. People here suggested he is Championship material. Blackett, whilst possesing zero intelligence atleast had the physique of a half decent centreback. No news of him. Varela was already spoken of as our first choice RB alongside Darmian/Valencia for next season. One bad game and he's nowhere to be seen. Same goes for Januzaj, Wilson etc. Whilst, I do give a lot of credit to van Gaal for how much opportunities he has given youth, he has been a hypocrite as well. He has mentioned it countless times that young players will be inconsistent and that we (fans i.e.) need to bepatient with them. But he seems to be the one showing the least patience for some players. I am sure Fergie would never do that.

It isn't really lobbying. Whilst you have a point about Rashford's goals, I think he have found it easier playing in a team like he has compared to what Willo had to contend with. There was little pressure on him, compared to how much there was on Willo.
Even though I have been a Rashford fan boy for over a year now, I still think Willo is the more naturally gifted of the two. He's faster, excellent close control, very good technique and a usually ruthless and calm finisher. He just needs to sort himself out mentally.

1179~~~
Well said. Good post.

1180~~~
I cant see Wilson doing the same, even though he's probably as talented. He just didnt look ready, very weak and fragile, lost more battles. On the bal, their dribbling, speed, explosivity is probably similar, with Wilson being a better finisher normally.

1181~~~
That was in 2007/2008 I believe. Am talking about his last few years, its pretty disappointing when your reserve team captain for two/three years cant get a look in at CB over the likes of carrick,fletcher and berba. 

I also remember him playing dross like diouf and obertan over the youngsters, maybe some of them could have gone on to become good squad players but werent given a chance. Alternatively, if the quality is poor then thats on him as well as he was in charge of recruiting and we did sign a lot of foreign youth players at that time. Am still disappointed petrucci never made it here, kid had serious talent but injuries ruined his career.

1182~~~
That was the group stages I believe when he played and scored from a corner.
That was the group stages I believe when he played and scored from a corner.

1183~~~
Are you talking about Tom Thorpe ? I am not so sure he was that highly rated anyway. Petrucci and Possebon as well were very highly rated and another midfielder whose name I can't remember but didn't progress too well due to injuries. Maybe it is a little true towards his later years (after 2009), but SAF never usually puts in a youngster into the first team right from the off anyways, unless they are truly special. Even the class of 92 were slowly introduced into the first team if I am not mistaken (I never watched them, just read about it, but those who did might corroborate). I do think that the group in the latter years was a little low on quality though. Simpson, Gibson are not exactly world class, but I don't know if that blame goes to him since he delegated the scouting for the youth team to Paul McGuiness ?

Fwiw, I actually like Diouf. He's been doing great at Stoke. Power, pace, he has a lot of great attributes. Obertan was always a gamble.

1184~~~
That I recall. He scored on his UCL debut did he not against some German or Russian team. But I meant another high profile game where I think Vidic was injured/suspended and Pique came in and did really well. Usually SAF is very tight lipped about his team selections, but he said well in advance that Pique would play in the game(s).

1185~~~
Tunnicliffe? Always thought he was average but was rated very well here. Yeah tom thorpe, for me, was the best CB prospect out of that group and was weird midfidlers/forwards starting in defense over him which was weakening us all over the pitch. Thats one thing I do like about LVG, he actually plays a youngster in the position rather than moving all first teamers around(which he just does for lolz anyway <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>).

Wasnt that against roma?

1186~~~
Think it was Eikrem. Admittedly, I din't rate Thorpe too highly, so wasn't too overly fussed that he didn't get much game time. 
Lol, he actually doesn't <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>. Borthwick Jackson is mostly a CB, so is TFM. Lingard was a No 10 I believe (Atleast I have been told so), but I get your point. Problem is now the one's that have been given a chance and not really done well at some point are nowhere to be seen. McNair, Varela, Blackett (Don't scowl, just an example), Januzaj, Pereira. So his method has its caveats unfortunately. 

Yeah, maybe that one. Dunno why I was so certain I thought it was against Barca. :|

1187~~~
This lad is such a nice surprise. 6 crucial goals over just two months. Fantastic.

1188~~~
Would people rate Rashford better than an 18 year old Welbeck ?

I had high hopes for Danny but he didnt make it,hope its not another false dawn with Rashford.

1189~~~
That's a difficult comparison isn't it? Two very different footballers. Danny can still make it to be honest. He's only 25 and he's looked sharp since his long injury lay-off.

1190~~~
Interesting comparison. IIRC fergie said that Welbeck would mature physically and then you'd see a better player. But I don't think we ever did.His link up play is good but what still lets him down is his finishing;he scores some great and vital goals but still misses the bread and butter strikers goals.

Rashford has made a a greater immediate impact.He doesn't really need to bulk up as he's already very quick an agile and he will develop more into the Vardy,Neymar type physique rather than the heavier set Welbeck who took a longer time to physically mature. In terms of who has made that transition and taken the responsibility I'd say Rashford but there's such a long way to go.

1191~~~
Yes. Welbeck is a player who chips in but generally puts in the work that helps others throughout the match. Rashford is a more decisive player and has been at all levels, I think.

Wilson seems to have issues with his strength and stamina as well as niggling injuries. He is every bit as talented as Rashford but looks like he needs to build his way up, similar to Kane at Spurs. No guarantees, but he is a special talent as well

1192~~~
A little late on this but what a goal. Amazing.

1193~~~
That goal was top class, gets better each time I watch it.

1194~~~
Very clinical finish and did well to create the space with the step over.

1195~~~
I really don't want us to sign a striker who will hinder his progress. This guy, along with Martial, Shaw, Immensah and fingers crossed Renato Sanchez are our future. 

Best case scenario, saw off Rooney and get Ibra in for a season or two rotating with Rashford and then this kid when 20 will be ripe and ready to rip the league to shreds.

1196~~~
Kid's special.

1197~~~
If he can work on his off the ball movement/positioning in the box from crosses he will be absolutely lethal.

The way he slows the ball down then accelerates is as good as anybody I have seen, and I love the little step overs/body faints he does to create that yard of space and unbalance the defenders. He completely threw Tomkins doing that.

When he's in the mood he is always a danger, 1 part that impressed me the most though was when he dropped off, got the ball into feet with the defender up his back and rolled him, shrugged off another and played a neat little through ball to Lingard. That sort of link up play show's he is more than just a fast runner/dribbler. IF he can keep that sort of agility when he's still 25/26 he will be 1 of the worlds best.

1198~~~
His sheer pace meant Tomkins had to keep backing off a yard allowing him room to shoot. If that's Rooney he probably doesn't get that. 

Hope he starts at Wembley

1199~~~
I just think when it comes to Wilson - we didn't offer the play around him. For the goal, Martial plays a nice pass and he can attack the defender. People forget, last season - we barely played the ball forward. We are a bit more stable this season and Rashford will benefit from that service. Wilson can be quiet and then BANG...but as he get's stronger he will be alright. We just need quicker/better service and get these kids in positions to score but when everyone else is negative it's not going to happen.

1200~~~
Again, I don't buy this. It would have been perfectly fine, and even expected, if Rashford had performed like Wilson did over the last year, instead of how he has actually played. Nobody would have criticised him for not performing despite seemingly having some sort of ideal conditions to do so. Likewise, no reason why Wilson could not have turned in Rashford like performances. If he had done, the conversation old be different. 

Also, I still also disagree with these assertions of their respective abilities. Players are to be judged on what they show, not hypotheticals. And Wilson is not faster than Rashford in my opinion either. From your description, Wilson is basically the better player, where's in reality, he isn't. They are both young players, so no absolutes, it isn't like he's proven it already and is just off form. He's yet to prove it at any real level. It's like insisting Quaresma is 'better than Ronaldo', or 'Fabio is the better twin'. If they were, then they would be.

1201~~~
So basically, Wilson came into a struggling attack, while Rashford had ideal conditions? This is making excuses for him. We haven't been a great attacking side for years. Players need to step up. Januzaj stepped into a struggling attack and didn't make excuses for himself. Even players like Iwobi came in and lifted Arsenal's attack when they were struggling to score. 

If Wilson is the player all are claiming he is, then he should be impacting like Adnan or Rashford did. We can't keep saying that unless we turn into Barcelona, these kids are all excused.

1202~~~
Looks like something special, this young man. We should continue to give him chances up front as long as possible. 
I hope that all the young talents who have been unearthed this season continue to develop into the next. 

We don't really need to buy a lot of new players. A top class right winger, a star signing to phase out Rooney, a central midfielder. That's all. Maybe another centre back. 

We have Rashford, Martial and Lingard showing promise in attack. BoJack, TFM, Varela looking good in defence. 
And this is while some of our promising stars - Pereira, WIlsone and Januzaj - are yet to get their chances, and Memphis still taking his time. 
All of these players should be afforded chances next season, too, no matter who the manager is.

1203~~~
But you are basically comparing the success/failure of two youngsters in two very different set-ups, which is very unfair imo. Not to forget they are two very different types of players as well, so it's virtually impossible to suggest how Rashford would have performed in the conditions which were provided to Willo or vice versa. That said, you are right in that one has delivered on this stage and the other has been stuttering.

What I have said are not hypotheticals. Like I said I am a huge Rashford fanboy, but I still think Willo is the more naturally talented. It's been backed up by how quickly he progressed through each age group. He was always playing at a level which was 2-3 years greater than his age group. He's also won the Jimmy Murphy young player of the year (which Rashford might win this year, though I don't know the rules for it). All these are accolades which indicate how highly Willo was rated. On the other hand, Rashford only started playing for the U21s this year and that too most of his appearances have been as subs. If you compare him to someone in his same age group, Alex Tuanzebe actually was a bedrock for U21s this year if I am not mistaken and played a lot of games for them, until his injury. He also won the same award Willo won two years ago. None of these are hypotheticals. These are all accolades bestowed upon these youngsters by the coaching staff and players. They get to see these players everyday, so I wouldn't doubt them really. And you can't really judge something like "Player A is better than Player B" and suggest that if it is true than he has to prove it so early. That's something which should be discussed after their respective careers are over. Everyone develops in different ways and injuries also play a huge part. So there is no saying how their careers will progress.  But in terms of natural ability, I still rate Wilson as the better talent.

1204~~~
Absolutely sensational finish.

1205~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://s697.photobucket.com/user/sweatybabyjesus/media/willo.jpg.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i697.photobucket.com/albums/vv340/sweatybabyjesus/willo.jpg" src="http://i697.photobucket.com/albums/vv340/sweatybabyjesus/willo.jpg"/></a>

1206~~~
That's terrifying <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1207~~~
To be honest, I've read a lot contrasting reviews about the pace. Some say Rashford has better change of direction, but Willo is quicker laterally. But I think Willo has better ability to run with the ball at speed. He's probably not as skillful as Rashford though.

1208~~~
What I love is how much of a big game player he is.

It's common to have talented youngsters who run riot against cannon fodder teams only to disappear in the big games. Rashford however has essentially won us the the games against Arsenal, City and a very good West Ham side. And he's still 18! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1209~~~
Yeah it's exactly that. Wilson is quicker with or without the ball at his feet but Rashford is more adept technically at beating a man or making sharp incisive movements at speed. Could be potentially terrifying for opposition having both in our side.

1210~~~
Looks like LvG found his new Patrick Kluivert.

Nice rotation and even nicer composure.

1211~~~
Wonder goal!

1212~~~
Yeah a front four of Martial, Willo, Rashford, Memphis/Lingard could see us having one of the fastest attacking groups in the world. Really frightening if all those players reach their true potential. It's amazing how just over a year ago, all of us were complaining about the lack of pace and how we weren't the United of old. But those four there are the epitome of United. Pace, Width, World Class Imports (Fingers crossed on Memphis), Excellent youth academic products to complement them.

1213~~~
Rashford has been incredible considering the circumstances. I think in a few years time we could have a great player on our hands. I hope we don't overplay him as he is still very young. I also think in the long run it would be bad if England called him up for the euros as expectation would be immense.

Also can everyone stop calling Wilson "Willo". Its as bad as "Wazza" in my opinion

1214~~~
Just saw his goal vs West Ham. Wow. Amazing talent.

1215~~~
He's surpassed all expectations. I'm eager to see what happens when Rooney is back. Will both play or Rashford gets benched?

1216~~~
I would have said that Rooney would play in the Mata role rather than up front. Rashford and Martial's pace particularly suggest they would be difficult to drop

1217~~~
We've got a gem here

1218~~~
He's been an absolute revelation. Clinical goals vs Arsenal, City and now in a cup quarter final. The younger players brought through as well as Martial's obvious talent have been the only bright spots this season.

1219~~~
I don't think he'll be better than Hernandez level for us. But probably basing this on gut more than logic.

1220~~~
He's already a more complete player then Hernandez.

1221~~~
No he's not.

1222~~~
He is. Hernandez was a goal poacher. Rashford may not have developed Chica's killer instinct just yet but he's faster and has more technique.

1223~~~
Up until that West ham goal I may have agreed with the Hernandez comparison, now I see a lot more in Rashford.

1224~~~
Hernandez has scored goals for Leverkusen and from his loan spells at Real Madrid that equal or beat Rashford's quality vs West Ham.

Don't get the speed reference, Rashford is quick but he's not a speed merchent compared to Hernandez. His build up play is no different either (so far. Conceeding he's 18 so can grow, but my call is just a gut feeling). Hernandez also carries more threat arially.

1225~~~
No

1226~~~
I will be delighted if he turns out a career eventually similar to Hernandez, never mind better

1227~~~
Sold to Leverkusen then scores a bucket load?

<span style="color: #ffffff">Jokes</span>

1228~~~
why are people underrating Rashford's speed, he's super quick, his first three strides are quicker than any other player in the team IMO, and that's what counts not top speed and I am not so sure he's slower than Hernandez on top speed either rather other way around, Hernandez wasn't that quick, he just liked to beat the offside trap so he gave us impression he's as quick as bolt, and also he wasn't any flashy, just clinical finisher so we just said he has his speed..

Think Rashford already has more to his game than Chicharito who is just now playing in a great team which creates chances for him so he can finish them inside the box, that's what he was brilliant in but never a starter for us, Rashford has a great potential, I would like to think that he is more than a simple impact player coming from the bench..

2014 Milk Cup. 

That step-over and ball roll <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1230~~~
It doesn't mean a huge amount in terms of effectiveness but in terms of overall top speed Chicharito got some attention for having a top speed of 32.15 kmph at the World Cup but Rashford was recorded at 34.41 kmph against City, Martial and Vardy have the joint top speed in the Premiership this year at 35.4 kmph

1231~~~
yeah but feelings

1232~~~
Although he's less than half my age, he's my new favorite player. When he got the ball, I'm expecting something good coming out. What do I know, though. I thought Welbeck would be future United legend.

I hope injuries goddes is being kind to him. And United next manager is willing to put effort developing him.

1233~~~
Yep, I agree. Certainly a very exciting prospect and I hope we develop him well. One thing LVG has done is give our youngsters a really good opportunity, although it could be argued it has been forced on him somewhat. However, credit where it is due. Fosu Mensah being another one that I believe has really really good potential.

1234~~~
Can you imagine the pace we would have with that front four you mentioned and having Shaw and TFM overlapping?

1235~~~
Yeah...one forgets about Shaw to be honest. I just hope he comes back the player he was before the injury. Those sorts of injuries can really affect a player mentally....take less risks....worry about hard challenges. However, many are fine...hope he's one of them.

1236~~~
I thought Shaw and Martial were fast but this lad took the piss against West Ham early enough chasing the ball down the left wing, he didn't get there but my word what pace!

1237~~~
Getting more and more scared that we'll appoint mourinho and sign ibrahimovic and have two 30+ strikers ahead of him as we finish 2nd in the league

1238~~~
At least it's better than Hargo.

1239~~~
Yes he is

1240~~~
Thinking of Triple Captaining him in my Fantasy team this weekend.

Stupid or a good gamble? (have a 100+ point gap to catch).

We have consecutive home games against Villa and Crystal Palace in a double game week.

1241~~~
Will get dropped for Rooney if you do. Stone waller.

1242~~~
That's a worry.

Think Rooney will slip into Mata's position tbh.

1243~~~
He'll probably come off the bench, I was just having a laugh.

1244~~~
Yes. That's a worry. Mata is a far better #10.

1245~~~
Standard goal from Marcus Messi<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1246~~~
What a bloke. Good stuff from Looney and Valencia too.

1247~~~
Again you see his intelligence with that goal. Sometimes standing still is the best move to make, and because he stayed where he was, Clark kept on going and left him behind unmarked, brilliant!

1248~~~
4 league goals and 4(?) cup goals?? 

Fantastic

1249~~~
Going to be so interesting to see how good he is once he fills out.

1250~~~
He's actually rather good isn't he?

1251~~~
How many goals away is he from being our top scorer this season?

1252~~~
And he did it again.

1253~~~
Boy wonder.

1254~~~
7 in 12 now. I think Martial is on 13?

1255~~~
What a player at his age, the things he's aready done for us only making his debut a few months ago..

1256~~~
Who has most of his games been on the left though.

1257~~~
I wonder what Woy is thinking?

1258~~~
<i>'I wonder if they still make Tunnock's Teacakes?'</i>

1259~~~
Wasn't there someone on here saying his technique wasn't good enough? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1260~~~
Someone said he is Joshua King v2 as well.

1261~~~
That's why I thought the comparisons with Hernandez were unfair, this guy has buckets more technique and class already.

1262~~~
Harry Kane who?

1263~~~
Well do they?

1264~~~
think Rooney has 14

1265~~~
His performances are as good as his nose is imposing.

1266~~~
Yep, think so.

1267~~~
As if anyone gives a crap about technique when you keep banging them in. He's fecking rapid and scores goals. Brilliant combination if you ask me!

1268~~~
Wow. Again, I go back to the type of goals he's scoring, which impresses me the most. I believe people either have an eye for goal or they don't. You can learn how to finish, I guess, but knowing where to be at the right time is very difficult, but he seems to have that in his locker. To add to that, he's got all the physical attributes to go with it. Fantastic talent.

1269~~~
He's fantastic.

1270~~~
Whatever their youth record was, rashford looks twice the player Wilson is at senior level.

1271~~~
hope we get him on a solid contract...before Real come a calling.

1272~~~
Louis, you old fraud, your bacon has been saved by an 18-year-old kid. Of course, it might mean we have to put up with you another season.

1273~~~
But can he do it on a rainy night at Stoke ? <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1274~~~
It's fantastic what he is doing.

He score a lot of opening goals and a lot of winning goals. To do it when the pressure is on is really impressive. He's not just somebody who chips in when there's a rout going on.

1276~~~
Louis's bacon was 'made' by youngsters to a certain extent, nothing shocking. He can spot talent, give it a chance and develop it. That's something very positive about him.

1277~~~
Quality player. If he keeps progressing, we mightn't rue LvG's decision not to buy a senior forward this season after all.

Long way to go though.

1278~~~
His bacon's being saved by Rasherford.

1279~~~
7 goals in 12 games is terrific for an 18 year old. Incredible.

I'm not THAT impressed with his game outside of his composure and brilliance in front of goal, however, I see it as a positive more than anything. This guy SHOULD turn into a beast in a few years time. If he doesn't, then it'd be very, very disappointing. If Memphis weren't so shit, we'd have an incredible future to look forward to.

1280~~~

1281~~~
Important quality this one.

1282~~~
I actually am kinda intrigued to see what can Mourinho make of this guy once he arrives. He has a bad rep on this place but the guy did mould Drogba from a promising one to a lethal striker, and to some extents fine-tuned Ronaldo's scoring game. I don't think to date, LvG has actually nurtured to completion a striker yet.

1283~~~
He did well again, ran the channels, made good runs and held it up well, plus he bagged another vital goal.

1284~~~
Match day live on MUtv;
I'm sure DDG just referred to Marcus as "Shagger"
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1285~~~
The shinning diamond in a season of collective coal.....

1286~~~
Definitely is. 

He's a good looking 18 year old starting upfront for Manchester United. I wouldn't be surprised if he's already a millionaire from signing that new contract.

If I was him I'd be pelting every single bird in sight.

1287~~~
Kluivert?

1288~~~
Depends if you think he's peaked by the time he left for Milan.

1289~~~
Didn't he buy him in Barca too?

1290~~~
Indeed he did. His record there was a bit iffy though. Solid 1 in 2 striker which put him in the top echelon at the time but 182 games over 6 seasons is quite poor and not many trophies to boast of.

1291~~~
Think that's in the league alone which is decent at 30 games per season.

1292~~~
Yeap. Final tally is 255/120. Quite strange that I didn't remember him that highly. It was all Fat Ronaldo, Rudd, Henry and Sheva growing up for me.

1293~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Haven't heard that in years

1294~~~
He could reach 10 goals for us, which is amazing considering he made his debut at the end of February and is only 18 years old. Never would have imagined that he'd make this kind of impact!

1295~~~
He's the real deal.

1296~~~
Rashford's scoring at a better rate than Rooney in Rooney's first season!

Rooney scored 17 goals in 43 apps. Rashford is on 7 in 12.

This is only a little nice stat, it doesn't mean that he's playing better than young Rooney.

1297~~~
We can keep doing this or you can show examples where his buildup play is better than hernandez. He got a great goal today and showed great movement in the 6 yard box,  checking and slotting it home.  but also lost the ball a couple times.

I love the guy and am excited as feck but the way some posters write you'd think he's suddenly Harry Kane level. The boy has played 12 league games and he's now a better player than Hernandez. Christ.

1298~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1299~~~
feck me i love Hernandez but aside from scoring goals he's absolutely shit at football, used to infuriate the fcuk out of me!

1300~~~
Those are literally the only kind of goals we've been scoring this season to be fair <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1301~~~
Which of course, is what matters most.

1302~~~
The highlight of our season and watching him play is the only thing to look forward to in our remaining league games.

1303~~~

1304~~~
^^^^^^^^^^^

The black Chuck Norris. Marcus Rashford is so tough...

1305~~~
At 18 where was Kane or Little Pea? This guy is 18 and is playing well and scoring the very few chances coming his way. At Arsenal he might have twice as many chances every game. Here its scraps right now and his shot conversion rate is very impressive. He could be a flash in the pan unlike Little Pea but jesus for his tender age he's about as impressive as its possible to be in this team!

1306~~~
Well, the stats speak for themselves <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1307~~~
He looks like has all the tools. Only going to get better and best of all - has the killer instinct infront of goal. It's a cliche but you're unlikely to develop that, generally you have it or you don't.

Physically he's got a lot of growing to do. Hopefully he becomes the player he can be.

1308~~~
Natural goal scorer.

1309~~~
I think these shouts that he should go to the euros have a bit of weight behind them (not that I think he will go but I think maybe he should). Now this is probably premature but I'm just using it as an example. Rashford is no where near as good as Ronaldo (when at the same age) and probably will never be good as Ronaldo (not that thats anything to be ashamed of tbh). 

But lets just look at what happened with Ronaldo. He went to the 1994 world cup, didn't play a single game. But you hear Carlos Parriera and Mario Zagallo talking about how they just wanted him to gain experience. And that worked out tremendously for Ronaldo who went on to become one of the best players ever and also featured in the next 2 world cup finals, winning one of them scoring both goals.

Now, this is England, and they probably won't win and his confidence might be shattered because England are, lets face it, shit. But its interesting to think about.

1310~~~
Hopefully, Mourinho will continue to give him chances.

1311~~~
He should go and warm the bench for me. Not sure of his abilities as an impact player but he has real pace....so if Vardy gets injured he's a natural replacement.....

1312~~~
Let him play for England U21s first ffs.

There was a time when an international call up was awarded based on a year's form.

England don't need to bring him, it's their strongest position. Vardy and Kane in top form, and Sturridge stating to play games. You also have Welbeck who is a very reliable England player and, of course, Captain Wonder Wayne Mark Rooney.

1313~~~
Did Kane ever play for the England youth teams? This lad could have an Owen intro who knows?

1314~~~
I think this tournament is one too early for him particularly because I know that if England start poorly they are going to need a saviour, a saviour they will crucify should he fail to save them. He is better off playing with the U21s or resting on holiday.

1315~~~
He's obviously had a dream start in terms of goals and it's really great to see a youth player make such an impressive start to a career but...I don't think he's been particularly impressive, in terms of showcasing 'top level' ability. By that I mean players like Rooney, Giggs and Owen burst on the scene and were immediately 'superstars' and you knew it. 

Tough to be compared to but I'm finding that Rashford is spoken about with the same anticipation and I don't think he's been close to what they showed at a similar age - I don't mean it is a criticism...given his age, he's well ahead of the standard development curve but he'll have poor spells and several setbacks, whilst facing criticism from pundits and fans. Basically, it's not just him that needs to stay grounded (seemingly he is) but talk of going to the Euros is madness IMO and I'd hope he doesn't to avoid being lumbered with the inevitable failure aftermath. 

After saying that, he's made more of an impact than almost any of our youth players in 2 decades but it'll be a few years of development before we really see how his career is going to shape. Exciting times though.

1316~~~
Yes, Harry Kane was very highly rated in the international youth setups.

1317~~~
But Stuart Pearce this week was saying he was never on their radar was that Article made up??

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03qmlkq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03qmlkq</a>

1318~~~
I'm a bit shocked he keeps finding the net. He's just so young and he didn't seem the type that you knew would explode at first team level. Glad he's doing well though.

1319~~~
Look; at this point, if he ends up at a Chicharito level in terms of impact and goal scoring ability, United would've struck gold. Obviously he's better on the ball but his pace, movement, intelligence and finishing are all similar to Chicharito's and he's been a tremendous goal scorer at every level. Comparing him to anyone at his age after 15 first team matches is kinda ridiculous but the Rooney/Giggs/Owen types don't exact grow on trees. We should be happy that he's even producing at this stage.

1320~~~
Eh his pace would leave Little Pea for dead. His link up play looks a different level already?

1321~~~
He did and was fairly prolific at every level from U17 to senior level.

He very well could. But as a United fan, I want him a million miles from France. The hype train is an unnecessary evil.

1322~~~
I did say he was much better on the ball. That encompasses everything to me. Chicharito was really very quick in/for Mexico and when he first arrived at United.

1323~~~
Pearce is a clown and was sacked for losing every game at his last Euros because he insisted on calling up shite like Delfouneso, Sordell, and Wickham. After he was sacked Kane was immediately called up and scored 8 in 14 apps.

1324~~~
Imagine if Martial didnt get injured against Midgetland. I dont think we would have even seen this guy start a game this season (his minutes would defo be much less than he has now).

Also boggles the mind he was taken off against Spurs last week, at 0-0. At half time.. for Ashley Young who went up top...

This guy is brilliant to watch live. His movement is fantastic. Raw but so exciting.

1325~~~
It's all the more impressive when you take into account that he's playing for a team that create feck all during most games. He gets at most 2 chances a game, he's had to be incredibly clinical.

1326~~~
The football gods appear to be done with their wrath against us.  These kids -- Rashford, Borthwick-Jackson and Fosu-Mensah -- have been brilliant.

1327~~~
It is actually quite astonishing to think of how far down he was in the pecking order, how many injuries he needed to get in, his lack of first team or even under 21s experience, coming into a barely functioning team with no momentum, to achieve what he has, its crazy. More importantly he is improving, especially in this last week, I thought his performance against west ham was his best overall but he topped that today, I was texting a friend raving about him a couple of minutes before he bagged, his overall play is really coming on leaps and bounds. Really hoping he doesn't get picked for the euros, gets his head down and keeps training then goes on the preseason tour firing on all cylinders and getting himself in the squad for next year. At this point in the worst case there would be a lot of premier league teams willing to take him on loan and give him minutes which is shocking considering a few months ago nobody including on this forum of united fans was talking about him.

1328~~~
He should have scored at least another goal yesterday. The chance Mata created for him was easier than his goal.

His movement and ability to run the channels are really impressive.

1329~~~
With Rashford in the team we have won 5 out of 7 PL games, i.e., we averaged 2,1 ppg. 

Had we been that good over the course of the season, we'd be on 70 points now, very close to Leicester. 

Amaizing impact from the lad.

1330~~~
Age is irrelevant in this context. My points and original discussion with develish was about how Rashford is not <b>already</b> better than Hernandez.

He's played 12 games and a couple of posters getting carried away.

1331~~~
12 games is a very limited snapshot, as promising as it looks. 

What I like is now there's almost an expectation for him to score and do well. I think that's healthy compared to the state of some other prospects we've had over the years who get balls-deep into their 20s and the level of expectation remains "if he didn't fall over he had a good game"

1332~~~
To be fair while he's perhaps not better than Hernandez overall, he's certainly better in this Utd team. Hernandez in my opinion was an incredibly infuriating player because he was simply brilliant in and around the box but the rest of his game left a lot to be desired. I think Rashfords hold up play is already better or at least on par, although I do still see this as an area he needs to improve upon but that should come as he physically develops. Rashford also seems to me to have more blistering pace, al be it that Hernandez was no slouch but he very rarely committed players through pace and dribbling in the way Rashford has done. In the box Rashford has a way to go to catch Hernandez, he's shown glimpses of great movement I.e his villa goal but Hernandez has consistently been one of the best for in the box strikers for awhile now. 

I certainly believe that Rashford has more tools in his pocket to become a better player than Hernandez who despite being a great goalscorer is an otherwise very limited player. But of course it remains to be seen how well Rashford physically matures and whether he can maintain and build on a decent technical game.

1333~~~
I haven't seen "blistering pace" in Rashford. I've seen pace, yes. He has the smartness to turn from a stationary position so as to trick the defenders standing flat on their feet. I'l give him that as a great asset but I'm not buying into the buildup point just yet. 

Hernandez wasn't constantly losing posession for us and he was constantly playing a bit part role which didn't help. I've seen Rashford make the wrong decision a couple times outside the box, agreed he's raw and also agreed that he will grow in that department. I just don't see him growing by much - total gut insinct before anyone shoots the opinion. I'm more harsh on expectations from youth, I didn't think Zaha or Januzaj would amount to much even when I saw them at their peaks. Rashford is different in that he'l at the very least be a useful goalscorer.. but I cant help but question if he'l be any more than that.

1334~~~
He matched Bellerin, was catching Koscienly and has left many other defenders dead on their feet. If that's not blistering pace I am not sure what else is? He is clearly very quick.

1335~~~
I think he can get alot quicker.

1336~~~
He's not as fast as Bellerein, even if you cite a one off example where he circumstantially matched him (I don't recall this but will take your word for it). If he was <i>that </i>fast, we'd see a many more examples of it in the games he features in. Konscienly means little, most pacy players can catch him, that doesn't make their pace 'blistering'.

1337~~~
You're probably somebody who thought Luke Shaw was slow too. The kid is very quick, but because he's working in tight areas all the time he only gets to show it over 10-15 yards. Rewatch the Arsenal highlights and you'll see. There was 1 part in the 2nd half when he raced Bellerin down the line and they were neck and neck.

1338~~~
It's his acceleration that sets him apart, it's lightning quick!

1339~~~
I never thought Luke Shaw was slow, and I don't think Rashford is either. Maybe I'm nit picking but its I disagree Rashford has "blistering pace". 

The pace discussion I'm holding kicked off when I said Rashford's pace doesnt look to be <b>much</b> greater than Hernandez. 

I'l rewatch the highlights, but surely you're not saying Rashford and Bellerein are on the same level of speed in general.

1340~~~
Hernandez's blistering pace was anyway usually of no use because of his inability to dribble at pace.

1341~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1UgzsiDH-NU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Watch this video from about 1.50 

He nearly runs around the outside of koscielny with the ball, who is arguably 1 of the quickest cbs. Then after that races bellerin down the line and looks more than equal. 

Maybe at 100m bellerin might have a better top end, but it wouldn't be much.

1342~~~
There is no reason why England needs to pick Rashford. They already have so many options there. Leave him alone and don't rush him because he is still raw and developing. I rather see him focus more on our club first than country. Not even a 6 month ago he was still in our U18. So there is no need to rush him and push him by adding so many experience in less than 6 months. It's too much for the teenager just let him enjoy the break and be ready for next season.

1343~~~
Firstly, Konscienly isn't the measuring stick for being a speed merchant and secondly he didn't win vs him and ended up losing the ball.

As for Bellerein, that was hardly a race - he accelerate for a short burst and thats about it.

My point re. Rashford still stands - he's certainly pacy player but not "blistering"like some would suggest. He has roughly what you'd expect in an 18 year old striker, its not like he's Walcott/Bellerein coming onto the scene with commentators saying "watch out for his pace" before he even played any games.

1344~~~
Is it too early to have Rashford go as a bit of a wildcard ?.

edit: I dont want him to go the euros as a pre-season and a nice break will do the kid a world of good than sitting on the England bench watching them doomed to fail in the euros.

1345~~~
No use. He ll not make the matchday squad.

1346~~~
The commentators didn't have a clue who he was or what he could do, I guarantee half the united fans didn't either! 

Ok well that's your opinion, koscielny is clearly 1 of the quickest cbs in the league, but if you can't see that then I'm not surprised you don't think rashford is fast either.

1347~~~
Well if Hodgson was serious about picking players on form, realistically only Kane would be ahead pf Rashford right now, no? Not like that would happen though.

1348~~~
I think we're all starting to see that there's more too him that speed and popping up at the right time to score, he's shown some real flair with his dribbling and passing.

1349~~~
There's a few things I like. Scoring against City, Arsenal and in a big cup game against West Ham is a great habit to have. Even his goal/s in the Europa league were important ones. So he's not scoring meaningless goals here. He should have scored another against Villa but i'm almost glad he missed. All these things are character building. It's almost easy to take for granted what he's done so far. But can he go up another level? When we do starting firing properly, and more chances come his way - can he score even more goals? It's difficult to say how good he could be and if someone like Kane is Englands Golden boy - then Rashfords still in diapers.

I know he was rated in the youth levels but no one can deny the jump up has been impressive. I wonder what crazy price would be on his head, if he played for an Everton or Southampton...Our youth has great potential and i'm glad we've seen that this season. They have not disappointed.

1350~~~
He is not expected to score every week now. So he can relax and do his stuff. But if he makes it big (another good season), then the press will be all over him checking each goal and the expectations will soar high adding to the pressure. 

Anyways early days. Let him enjoy the form.

1351~~~

1353~~~
OMG, this guy is good!

1354~~~
Fantastic player.

1355~~~
He's just getting better and better, I really didn't expect him to get this good this quickly.

1356~~~
Every week he keeps on impressing, brilliant awareness with the backheel and stepover tonight. If he doesn't go on and become the real deal I'll be really disappointed.

1357~~~
So many quality backheels last few games.

1358~~~
Class again, his movement and anticipation and awareness of his teammates is superb for such a young player, and his lay-offs are very good, there is much more to him than many initially thought IMO.

1359~~~
Top player.

1360~~~
Loved that dummy for Lingard. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Still needs to work on his finishing though. And you can clearly see what being from the academy means to him. Him and Lingard just keep backing each other non-stop on and off the field. Lovely to see.

1361~~~
Extremely talented player. Still very raw but he has some great attributes and he seems to be constantly improving.

1362~~~
Heh? Koscielny is one of the fastest CBs around. Also it's funny that you say that about commentators. One of the very first things the sky sports commentators said about him early in the Arsenal match was that they didn't know that much about him but the main thing they had heard about him was that he had explosive speed. So you are basically 100% wrong.

1363~~~
Very impressed by his vision and awareness. He seems to show another dimension to his game every time he plays. Like Martial there are no obvious weaknesses

1364~~~
It's insane, having him under our nose all this time in reserves.

Natural talent, carrying his team with finesse.

1365~~~
Looking more and more like a top premier league player with every passing game.

1366~~~
Got his chance because of injury but our two strikers are fit now and he still starts. Made the position his own.

1367~~~
Sensational talent. That backheel was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1368~~~
There's always work needed to be done to improve but I don't think finishing is a problem to be honest.

1369~~~
I can see what Van Gaal means by asking him to stay within the box and keep the two center backs occupied. He's dangerous when he is in the middle and we lose our point of attack when he drifts wide. There's plenty of players willing to get the ball in the box, we need him there to finish those chances.

1370~~~
Did he pick up an injury? He looked hurt after Darmian scored:


Still, such an exciting talent. Thought he'd just be the generic, pacey, no technique English youth we've seen more than enough of but it looks like he's got more in his locker.

1371~~~
His hold up play is fantastic. The way he brings others into the game and his awareness is surprising but pleasant. Hes rapid too which is great for this league.

1372~~~
Anyone have a video or gif of this backheel. 

Think I missed that changing my stream. 

<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a>

1373~~~
which min?

1374~~~
First few games he was scoring goals and getting into great positions, next few games after that he was getting into good positions but not being fed, but in the last few games he has become a completely different specimen. His hold-up play, link-up play, passing, awareness, vision, creativity, willingness to get involved early in the attack and to take up unconventional positions to try to make something happen is so much improved its like watching a different player, confidence is doing wonderful things to his game. I thought a few games in he could go on to be a good poacher, but his last few displays have suggested there is far too much to his game not to get involved in play before the box. He is the highlight of this season.

1375~~~
Its in the 19th minute going into the 20th

1376~~~

1377~~~
Gets better every time I watch it


And thanks GifLord

1378~~~
Top class. Too bad Lingard's decision making is so shit and nothing came out of it. Would have been a fecking sensational assist.

1379~~~
Rashford's speed of thought is great. All those flicks, backheels and stepovers are very positive signs for his future potential.

The comparison to Wilson tends to focus on the big attributes. But it's the little things which are hard to quantify that often make a difference. He simply looks like a player who a split second quicker in his head. That's worth just as much as raw talent.

1380~~~
Nah, his finishing at U18 level was woeful. You only need to look at the Youtube videos to see that. He's been working on his finishing since December in particular and that has obviously helped massively, but I still think it needs working.
For example, that goal he scored against West Ham which everyone raved about. I agree it was a fantastic goal, but he didn't quite open his body up the way he was hoping to and didn't manage to get the curl he would have wanted, compared to how we saw Martial score a similar goal early in the season. 
He doesn't quite have that striker's instinct yet in my opinion. He has fantastic movement, but I still feel he's not got the lethal touch like say Chicharito or even Wilson (Not saying this to start another Rashford vs Wilson discussion).

Obviously, he's just 18 and has a long long way to go before perfecting all that. Great talent undoubtedly.

1381~~~
Yes. I am 100% wrong because Konscienly has "explosive speed" and a video trying to prove Rashford has "blistering speed" actually had him racing Konscienly and losing the ball as he got tackled by him. Moreover, being a fast CB is relative to other CBs. 

Don't say a winger has blistering speed and compare him to a CB FFS. Take Wilf Zaha from yesterday for example - he has a great burst of pace but he's not the fastest in the league, or even in the top 3 for that matter. Rashford accelerated down the right wing and Zaha caught up with him from behind. Rashford is fast, but dont go OTT.

Good one.

1382~~~
He's only 18 haha that's just silly

1383~~~
Lot of fun to watch him. Has really good instincts which are hard to develop.

1384~~~
Yeah, kinda ruined the goal for me! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1385~~~
Rashford was running with the ball though.

I think with Rashford it is his pace over 10 yards that is exceptional and that is more crucial for a striker.

My one criticism of him is that he overdoes his dribbling at times, he gets himself in a great positions and then turns again.

1386~~~
Looks a really good talent. He does at times look like he doesn't quite have control of his feet when he's running at defenders. In fact, he looks better for me when he's linking up and does things instinctively as opposed to when he's running straight at defenders.

1387~~~
He's like a younger, right footed version of Martial, minus the death stare and £36 million.

You'd never have known her started life as a winger, the transition to striker has been very smooth. Plus this only plays to his advantage when he drifts out wide, taking defenders with him. So comfortable in possession and doesn't lack the audacity to try out tricks and flicks around the box. Nothing seems to phase him. The boy is destined to be a star.

1388~~~
Was just an example <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>
I did say it was a fantastic goal.

1389~~~
What was this about LvG saying that Rashford " is not ready, and he knows that" in today's press conference? Just saw that Luckhurst tweeted it, but he gave no context for the quote.

1390~~~
He means he shouldn't be playing week in week out, he's not ready to be the first choice centre forward for club and country.

1391~~~
You're 100% wrong because you said no commentator said anything about Rashford being really quick when as I pointed out they did. You seem to think I was talking about Koscienly. Could you not read or remember your own post? How hard could it be to remember your own post?  <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>  And then you got sarcastic about it. I don't really know what to do other than laugh <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1392~~~
I remember the first time he came on (as sub I think) Mickey Owen also said that he was "lightning quick" and that he was impressed when he has seen him play in our youth teams

1393~~~
He's the best thing that we got from this shit LVG reign. Hopefully the next manager continues to play him.

looking for an agent apparently? i wish every young player from the academy/manchester born handle their career like the way gary neville, paul scholes or ryan giggs did. never really negotiate a new deal for the sake of money but years of extension offered instead. 

i read gary's autobiography and when he signed a 7 year contract at the age of 21, some people asked him why did he signed a very long term deal his answer was because the board didn't offer him 10 years,that's why he settled for 7. 

didn't expect these kind of things happening now but hopefully rashford and the young lads can avoid being in the news every summer transfer seeking for new deals.

1397~~~
I supposed you didn't know why Rashford was linked with City two years ago.It's very normal these days for a youngster's camp to put his name on paper to put pressure on the club.Everyone is doing it.Football now is a different business than it was 20 years ago.

1398~~~
20 years ago was also the same thing in term of players need agent for negotiation with clubs, it's about money. The difference is people like Gary Neville, Scholes and Giggs are only care about playing for one same club only not wages. It's understandable if youngster nowdays want money. But I hope Rashford isn't one of them.

1399~~~
I can see how it is better for a player to protect their careers though. For example, if Rashford signed a (Neville length) 7 year contact for £50k for example, then he is in a much weaker position to negotiate two Yeats down the line if he continues his progress and becomes one of the best youngsters in the world 

If he signs a four year contract, two years down the line he only has a short time remaining. The club need to pay him his demands or risk losing him in a couple of years on a free transfer

1400~~~
I genuinely misread your commentator point was re. Konscienly not Rashford, hence the sarcasm (I was wondering why the feck someone would talk about commentators talking about Konscienly's pace). But the point still stands, don't get OTT about his pace. He's about as quick as Zaha which is fast but nothing extraordinary for his age.

1401~~~
Yeah I know, just messing. Shooting techniques can always be learned by practice so we can just assume that he will become even better <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> *Looking at you Lingard!*

1402~~~
This was before he made his debut.

1403~~~
Thanks. Seems a bit strange. As long as he plays and delivers more than the options are likely to do, he should be playing. If he hits a rough patch, rotate him out.

1404~~~
I see the jackals are all over him...

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/article4736917.ece?shareToken=72fcc947d5326b91de3ccd8ec45cdfb3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport...e?shareToken=72fcc947d5326b91de3ccd8ec45cdfb3</a>

1405~~~
Jesus christ, the article mentions that Ronaldo, Sterling, Rooney and Bale's agents all want to sign him. Also says that he's expected to sign a 15k p/w contract soon.

That's some rise to fame.

1406~~~
Keep forgetting his 18, he's very mature on the pitch like Martial. We've some pair on youngsters on our hands. Finally, something positive came out of the absolute terrible few seasons post-fergie. Luke Shaw, 20, was comfortably the best LB in the league too before injury and TFM looks a right gem too. That could be our core should they all reach full potential.

1407~~~
Any of those agents and we're gonna get rinsed for wages. Not too keen on Mendes and especially Sterling's agent, they'd probably try and turn his head to other clubs if we fail to achieve anything in the next few seasons.

1408~~~
yup. it would be good to have players who cares about playing for united first. money second. 

we can only hope.

1409~~~
Exciting youngsters indeed.

1410~~~
Seems like a quality lad, both professionally and personally.

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>‘Everyone else was asleep but Marcus was doing sit-ups and press-ups’</b></span>
<span style="font-family: 'Arial'"><span style="font-size: 15px">
Oliver Kay talks to former teachers, coaches and even the local takeaway owner about Manchester United’s boy wonder before this evening’s FA Cup semi-final against Everton at Wembley

February 25, 2016. Marcus Rashford is at the Manchester United team hotel, dining with the first-team squad before their Europa League encounter with Midtjylland. He is told that he will be on the substitutes’ bench. He calls home to tell his mother. She asks if she should make her way down to Old Trafford. “No,” he tells her. “I won’t get on.”

To his shock — not to mention his mother’s — Rashford is drafted into the starting line-up after Anthony Martial is injured in the warm-up. The 18-year-old scores twice on his debut and, for what feels like the first time all season, the United crowd have something to cheer about.

His mother, Melanie, cannot believe she missed his biggest moment, but she is overjoyed when he comes home. He is all over the next day’s papers — “all over them like a Rash”, to borrow from a popular red-top headline. Louis van Gaal tells him to keep his feet on the ground.

Three days later he makes his Barclays Premier League debut at home to Arsenal. He scores twice again, this time with his mother in attendance. “It’s unbelievable,” says a delighted Van Gaal.

Rashford’s sudden, spectacular emergence feels like a throwback to another age — stuff out of Roy of the Rovers, you may call it, a refreshing break from the stifling reality faced by so many young English footballers trying to make the grade with their local team.

Some wondered if he might be a flash in the pan, but no, the Rashford bandwagon has kept going. He has scored seven goals, some of them crucial or spectacular or both, in 13 first-team appearances for United, been proposed as a possible wild-card pick for England at Euro 2016 and, before he commits to a new contract worth tens of thousands of pounds a week, he has several of the sport’s most powerful agents — including Jorge Mendes, who works with José Mourinho, among many others — scrambling for the right to represent him. This evening brings an FA Cup semi-final against Everton at Wembley and, yes, his mother will be there. Rashford and his family are living the dream.

When Wayne Rooney made his debut for Everton as a 16-year-old in 2002, he and his family were still living in a council house in Croxteth, one of Merseyside’s toughest districts. Times have changed. Long before Rashford made his breakthrough into the United team, the teenager and his family had moved from Wythenshawe — the sprawling district where <i>Shameless</i> was filmed — to a five-bedroom detached house on a quiet road in Ashton-on-Mersey, just around the corner from the school (with an “outstanding” Ofsted rating) where, as part of his United scholarship, he spends Monday mornings and Thursdays studying for BTEC diplomas in business studies and sport.

Button Lane, Wythenshawe, is only three miles away, but it feels like a different world. “They moved away a few years ago,” a former neighbour says. “They still own the house here, but they rent it out now. You still see Marcus back here from time to time, but the family are sensible. They didn’t want to be around all this.”

“All this” is not easy to identify on a sunny April afternoon. Button Lane, in Northern Moor, might not be as quaint as it sounds, but nor does it appear as it did in <i>The Duchess On The Estate</i>, in which the Duchess of York paid an extended visit and portrayed it as the epitome of Broken Britain — “very sinister”, “these guys come out with their mobiles and knives as an accessory”, “that chap with the gun, it’s terrifying, it looks like a movie”.

Terrifying or not, Wythenshawe was a step up for Rashford and his family. Initially he had been brought up on the border of Withington and Moss Side in the midst of some localised but very troubling gang crime. “His mum was very shrewd,” says Dave Horrocks, academy development manager at Fletcher Moss Rangers, the youth team where Rashford first caught United’s eye as a seven-year-old. “There were problems where they were living and she was able to see how things might pan out if they stayed. She got them moved away and out of the firing line, so to speak. Compared to where he had been before, Northern Moor was quite affluent.”
“His mum is a diamond,” a family friend says. “His parents split up when he was quite young, but his mum always looked after the kids and kept them on the straight and narrow.”

Another consequence of that move was to take him from Manchester City territory — close to Maine Road and what was then their school of excellence at Platt Lane — to United territory. “He was being courted by both of them,” Horrocks says. “And because he was football-mad, he would train with United one night and City the next. The family didn’t have a car and, whereas City was on his doorstep, it was difficult for him to get to United, which was on the other side of town, so I sometimes used to pick him up and take him there.”

What was he like as a kid? “I couldn’t get two words out of him,” Horrocks says. “He was very shy, very quiet, but very focused.”

Simon Pyne, a teacher at Button Lane Primary School, is casting his mind back to a school trip to the Lake District — abseiling, canoeing, that sort of thing. “Even at that age, ten or eleven, Marcus was just so dedicated,” he says. “He would be up before the staff in the mornings, doing press-ups and sit-ups, preparing for the big time. He was already signed up with United by then and you could tell he wanted it so much.”

Pyne feels that Rashford’s focus, as well as the influence of his mother and older siblings, helped him to avoid some familiar pitfalls. “There were other boys of his age who went down other paths, if I can put it like that,” the teacher says. “He did extremely well to remain as motivated and dedicated as he was, considering some of the peers he had. His mum made sure of that. She pushed him, school-wise as well as football-wise. He had things to aim for from a very early age and he has absolutely made the most of that. Children don’t always have that.”

“You don’t have a crystal ball, so you never know for sure,” Horrocks says, back at Fletcher Moss Rangers, “but Marcus is one of those whose talent shone through straightaway. He scored 12 goals in one game. He was greedy with the ball, always looking to dribble and shoot. That’s not a criticism. We encourage them to dribble and shoot at that age because that’s what they enjoy. You work on the passing later. He was always hungry for the ball. Even when he was walking here with his brothers, Dwaine and Dane, he would be dribbling a ball all the way here or balancing it on his head.”

He quickly came to United’s attention. “I had him from under-7s to under-10s,” Phil Brogan, a former academy coach at United, says. “He was a great mover. He scored goals, but at that age it was more about what he did on the ball — he was quick, great skills, great technique. He was like a Brazilian player, the way he dribbled. The way we coached them, particularly once René Meulensteen came in, was about taking risks, expressing themselves – no fear. That was Marcus. He was a happy kid, always with the ball at his feet.”</span></span>

1412~~~
2/2


<span style="font-family: 'Arial'"><span style="font-size: 15px">At that time, the player causing most excitement in United’s academy — among everyone, from Sir Alex Ferguson down — was another Fletcher Moss Rangers graduate from Wythenshawe. Ravel Morrison was four and a half years Rashford’s senior, but his talent was undermined by a complex personality and a perceived susceptibility to trouble and “the wrong crowd”. At 23 he is at Lazio, but his career has been unravelling for some time.

“Marcus’s family kept him away from the negative influences that Ravel couldn’t get away from,” Horrocks says. “The best listeners are the best learners. Of the many players from Fletcher Moss who have made it into professional football, Ravel was the only one who wasn’t a listener. He got where he got to through pure talent. Marcus had talent, but, like Danny Welbeck, he was a listener. He would take on board whatever was said to him.”

Morrison’s development was characterised by peaks and troughs in mood and performance. Rashford’s progress through United’s academy was serene. The only worry he caused United was when City came calling again around his 16th birthday. City were determined to sign the one who got away, but Rashford stayed put. He felt he was on course for where he wanted to be.

Last season Rashford scored 13 goals in 27 appearances for United’s under-18 team — a promising return, but not enough to see him fast-tracked to the under-21s, let alone the senior squad. He made his debut for the under-21s only in September, but within two months he had been given a first-team squad number and named as a substitute for a Premier League game away to Watford. Nicky Butt, now United’s head of academy, showed him clips of Ruud van Nistelrooy to teach him how to learn to be in the right place at the right time. Rashford took all the advice on board and started to score regularly for the under-21s. The big time was getting closer, even if the thought of regular first-team football for United still seemed distant.

That unscheduled debut against Midtjylland in February, brought about by a severe injury crisis, changed everything. Ferguson often said that you needed to test young players in the first team before you could be sure whether they would sink or swim. Rashford has done more than swim. He has quickly soared to heights that few, even at United, expected.

“I always thought he had the talent and the right attitude, but he has added different things to his game,” Brogan says. “He was a winger in those early days, but he has developed into a really good centre forward. He’s had a growth spurt, which helps, and he looks good in the air now. His finishing is so calm. One thing I would say is that people haven’t seen much of his skills and tricks yet. I’m sure that will change as his confidence grows. He’s a great talent. He can be anything he wants to be.”

Something that everybody says about Rashford is that he wants to optimise his talent. He does not want to be a flash in the pan, an eight-week wonder. Van Gaal has been consistent not only in selecting him but with a mantra about the need to stay humble, work hard and keep improving. Rashford’s family, particularly his older brothers, have rallied around to try to protect him from Manchester’s bright lights and the perennial problems of hangers-on. That includes the dilemma over whether to enlist the help of an agent to negotiate his first big contract or whether to continue to look after his affairs with help from Welbeck’s brothers.

Rashford is said to have remained gloriously unaffected. The morning after his two goals against Arsenal he could be found in the sixth-form common room at Ashton-on-Mersey School. A few weeks ago he could be seen back on Button Lane with friends. “He came in for a chicken patty or some fried chicken,” Hemen Farouq, at J’s Rhythm takeaway, says. “He’s a nice guy, a good guy, the same as he was when he was living over the road.”</span></span>

1413~~~
I went to Button lane primary, the area is nowt special but it certainly isn't the bronx.

I will also be getting a curry from J's rhythm later.

1414~~~
Anyone else starting to think that we might not need to sign a new striker this summer due to the rise of Rashford? 
Martial, Rashford and Rooney could do the job next season if Rashford keeps on performing and Rooney's form doesn't deteriorate further. I'm starting to think that it might be worth a gamble and it would also mean we can spend more money to strengthen other positions in the team.

1415~~~
Well, Rooney is our worst striker yet plays every game he's fit so he needs to be replaced this summer. But Rashford is first name on the teamsheet for me now. Long may it continue.

1416~~~
Agree. Our problems are in the buildup phase and we need at least a top class right winger.

1417~~~
Would love to see him carry on his great form and get a goal or two today to help fire United into the Final, he is a breath of fresh air at times. The goal at West Ham in the QF was an absolute beauty.

1418~~~
Honestly, its why I'm on board with Ibra. Cart Rooney off to the knackers yard, get in Ibrahimovic for a couple of seasons, rotate him with Rashford whilst he's young, malleable, and does not need to be over-burdened then ship Ibra off to the MLS in 2018 when Rashford is 20.

I'd rather do that than spunk £60m+ on Lukaku and have a selection problem for years.

1419~~~
This! 

Martial-Rashford-new winger and our front line is set for the years to come with Depay-Rooney-Lingard as backups, not bad IMO. But we also need to add real quality in the middle of the pitch as well in defence (at least 1 proper CM, ideally 2, and 1 CB).

1420~~~
The problem as I see it is getting rid of Rooney. With his wages I can see no European club being interested in signing him so the only chance we have is if he would accept a move to China.

1421~~~
Rooney's going nowhere. You know he will be here a long time. And he's definitely not the sort to go to China. More likely MLS when he thinks it is time or maybe back to Everton.

1422~~~
Everton will have to throw solid chunk of their budget to pay him for his presence on the pitch.

Agreed on him staying here for while. Probably even Mourinho will have a soft spot but it's actually interesting where he'll play under new reign when we all know Mou likes instant progress and title charge in matter of one or two seasons.

1423~~~
If it's Mourinho at the helm, the answer should be simple. A 4-2-3-1 with Rooney at No 10. I doubt Mata will be at the club for long and there really is no one else who can fill that role. 

And regarding the Everton switch, I remember reading about it somewhere either from him or from some other source. By that point, he really won't even need the Money (Not that he needs it now either) and will happily take a wage-cut. I expect something similar to the Lampard deal to be struck between an MLS club and Everton.

1424~~~
I can't see Rooney going to Everton before his current contract runs out, in fact I think it's highly unlikely that he will be going anywhere before that. Like <a class="username" data-user="97925, @Ijazz17" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/97925/">@Ijazz17</a> said he doesn't seem to be the type that would go to China so I think we'll be stuck with him for 3 more seasons.

This means that we'll have Rooney, Rashford and Martial in the squad for the foreseeable future and I think it would be smarter to spend our money on players in other positions than getting a 4th striker which could limit the amount of playing time for Rashford in the coming seasons.

1425~~~
Back to Everton in the summer would be the dream

1426~~~
4-2-3-1 sounds great as it creates chances for Rashford and possible new addition but even in that system Rooney may have efficiency problem with tempo of the league. That could even apply to Everton where they play quite aggressively.

One more year with the new manager ? If he'll fail expectations then it will be even more obvious what to do with him.

1427~~~
So good to read that he's got a brain and strong work ethic. Don't want to get too carried away with him as there's too many cases of promising starts petering out, but he's got a bloody good set of attributes to start off with.

1428~~~
Lol, let's get Moyes on the phone and tell him the Everton position is available. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>
But that's been the thing hasn't it. He's had games this season where he hasn't impressed and then scores a flurry of goals like he always does and by the end of the season, his numbers don't look all that bad. So in the eyes of any Manager, he'll really not have failed in expectations.

Also I doubt Rashford will be first choice for Mou as well. Probably Martial or he'll undoubtedly bring in a typical Mourinho striker.

1429~~~
Well... to be honest he kinda started scoring when we were outside CL and title race. Not wanting to downgrade his contribution but he wasn't really there when he was needed. LvG and his poor striker management also contributed to the fail but I'm patient enough to see Mourinho doing his magic and bringing him to his oldschool best.

Perhaps it's a matter of having world class players around him like it was around 2008 ? Change of manager could be a solution to many problems.

1430~~~
I am not exactly sure if it's the striker management as such. I think it's the and god I hate this word now, <i>philosophy</i> of van Gaal. He's mentioned it many times and Rooney has too in interviews as to what he expects of his striker. The games where Rooney did score was where he reverted to type and played the role of a secondary striker rather than leading the line. He played deep, played those Hollywood passes of his etc,. Even van Gaal has spoken to Rashford and Martial about the need to stay in the box and not drift wide to the channels. There is no doubt Rooney has declined physically, but if he is unshackled, I think he can do a good job for us for another 2 years.

But yeah, a change in Manager is the only way to really know if the problem lies with him or if it was the Manager all along.

1431~~~
Just signing even one world class striker with versatility may change it all as Rooney will have to finally fight for place in the squad and like you said from his biological clock's standpoint it doesn't have optimistic prognosis for his future here.

One or two years sounds fair. He's being promoted now to a club's legend status who'll maybe beat club's record or two and end his United journey in full glory. Hopefully parting ways will be as subtle as it sounds. Already created lots of good memories during SAF's era to enjoy his time here.

1432~~~
What a player!

1433~~~
What's his value right now?

1434~~~
He has no price, he's ridiculously important to our team already. If he turns out the player he should, he won't be leaving either.

1435~~~
Hope not. His agent is a dick.

1436~~~
Oh I know that, he could well be a lifer. Just curious as to how he'd be valued on today's market.

1437~~~
We still need another striker. No question. 

We are Man United. The prospect of having some decent strength in depth should not seem so outrageous.

We need a right winger and a proper no. 10 also. Desperately.

It's still a bit early for him to get a proper valuation. if he carries on his impressive start into next season, the sky is the limit for a top young English prospect. Especially a striker.

1438~~~
Upwards and onward. Well done lad!

1439~~~
Get him signed up on a long term deal.

1440~~~
He's really great. An absolute threat dribbling at pace and his flicks in and around the final third are fantastic.

1441~~~
Wish he would get in the box more. Apart from that, perfectly happy for him to be our main striker next season.

1442~~~
He was good again, just could not finish his chances. His link up play is great.

1443~~~
You'd be happy with that performance from a player with years of experience, let alone someone playing their 14th professional match. He's a threat in so many ways.

1444~~~
Very mature performance, constantly pressing at the right time and linking well down both channels, he's a diamond!

1445~~~
Some of the quick pass and move football with Martial and Lingard was just brilliant. Hope the hype doesn't get out of hand, but I'm excited about our future right now.

1446~~~
His best all round performance for us. Shame he didn't get a goal as he had a couple of good chances

1447~~~
Same, same, same. I think if we can add one or two players (maybe for the right and up top) we can have a good bunch of six players rotating and keeping fresh for next season.

1448~~~
The boy has been fantastic since breaking into the first team. Yes, he's scored a number of goals, which is obviously critically important. His all around game, though, is very impressive. His hold up and link up play - particularly the latter - has been very good. He's tall, strong, fearless and fast. He plays with confidence and hunger. Think back and compare his contribution to what Rooney was offering up top. It's like night and day, and has helped transform our attack to some extent (as a team there's still plenty of work to do in that regard). By any objective standard, he's been thoroughly impressive. For me, he has shown much more potential than players like Januzaj and Wilson ever did. Hopefully he keeps getting his chances and goes from strength to strength. He needs a better squad number next season!

1449~~~
Quite impressive today.. Like the fact he is seen as a threat now and he himself knows it, which is very good for the team and movements around the box.
I really don't want a new striker. One would expect first season players to naturally grow as footballers, with game time and feeling more relaxed in their squad position. Retaining his position ahead of Rooney, seemed to have unleashed the potential whole package.
I naturally don't think experience is transferable and bringing in a top striker should be to push him harder..not to learn from. Coaches and games will teach him more than any other player.

1450~~~
His link up play is superb. Those flicks <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1451~~~
I was impressed with him once again today. 

He plays like a seasoned player, very mature for his age. 

Can't wait to see him get even better.

1452~~~
I personally don't think we need a wc striker. I would be much happier with a Martial, Rashford, Wilson trio for next season and Rooney playing like how he did last night against Everton. But it all depends on the manager.

And to me Rooney is already a legend. I know he's probably not going to get the same sort of Love as Cantona or Ronaldo, but he's been an excellent United player for the last 10-12 years <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1453~~~
I think if we make it absolutely clear that he isn't a key, guaranteed starting player, anymore we will make that decision for him. He won't accept losing his 'privileges' and doesn't have it in him anymore to play himself back into contention - at least not likely. So if he was dropped he'd either feck off or pull his socks up.

1454~~~
Agreed.

Up until this match I didn't think Rashford was ready to be our main striker. Indeed, it wouldn't have surprised me if he 'only' ended up reaching a level somewhere in between Welbeck and Macheda. He's started brilliantly, but many players do and end up falling away.

But after this match I'm starting to allow myself to dream. Almost every match he improves different things, and his all-round game, movement and link-up play is just getting better and better. He does need to become more of a goal threat (after scoring four in his first two games, he's only scored three in the next twelve or so), but the way he combines with Martial in particular but also Lingard is fantastic. Maybe, just maybe, he is ready to go into next season as our true #9.

1455~~~
He has a song and it's fecking great, welcome to the big time lad <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1456~~~
Absolutely love the guy. He has everything I've wanted in a modern striker; pace, strength, ball skills and dribbling. If he could work on his predatory instincts/when to move in the box to get the ball he will be unstoppable.

Shame we can't combine him and chicharito as they would be the ultimate striker

1457~~~
Does anyone have a gif or link to the trick pass he made in the second half? It was a very fat Ronaldo or Ronaldinho piss of skill <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a>

1458~~~
Apparently he can hit those dipping freekicks like Ronaldo does

Tony then slows it down to nothing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1461~~~
What did you want him to do? Cross the ball to all the non-existent players in the box?

1462~~~
Thanks man!

1463~~~
No one for him to cross to. Rooney really should be getting into the box from there, instead of waiting at the edge for a pull-back.

1464~~~
who did Elastico in the first half? Him or Martial? Think its him as he likes to do that but im not sure and the pricks didnt show replay...

1465~~~
Read earlier in UWS that he's already started his coaching badges

1466~~~
Yeah it was him, at ~37:00 mins.

1467~~~

<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> thanks <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1471~~~
It's one of the attributes that sets him apart from Welbeck. Quick feet.

1472~~~
His appreciation of where his teammates are and where they will move to is exceptional already. He has the skill to be able to find the right pass. Because he's got this ability you see players like Martial and Lingard make runs off him that they probably wouldn't bother to do if Rooney had the ball.
Lightning quick and will only get stronger as he gets older.
Plenty to like about him, hope he continues in the team and continues to get better and better.

1473~~~
His first touch and lay-offs are class, he's having the classic LvG strikers game where he doesn't get a lot of the ball but he's used it smartly when it's came to him.

1474~~~
Agreed. I think he would also benefit if we pushed to two at the top which would allow him to drag defenders away and leave the space for the other striker (or if we had a good Lampard prime type midfielder to go into).

1475~~~
He's so scared of physical confrontations. Was non-existent today. Need to get him more involved since he's our second best player.

1476~~~
Barely in the game at all today, didn't make it difficult for Huth or Morgan at all.

1477~~~
Today was a good learning experience for him against a stubborn defence who don't get dragged out of position very often.

Some nice flicks from him here and there and he hit some strikes with real venom, only to see them blocked by the wall that is the Leicester City back four.

1478~~~
He needs to at least compete for the long balls. Never mind that he won't win them but at least challenge and maybe cause a mistake from the CB. Very tough to have a lone striker who doesn't bother at all.

1479~~~
He usually does compete for them and has won some vs Likes of demichelis and Koscielny etc.. as well but today vs Huth and Morgan just gave up strangely.

Tried to drift in the right channel but wasn't really in the game today.

1480~~~
Due to being in Australia/NZ all season I've never actually watched him play a full match. Managed to catch the game last night and although he was barely in it, some of his little touches and layoffs are sublime.

1481~~~
Did have a single/ opening chance created for him all game? He's up against two physical CBs. The play seems to be he tried to escape his marker and wait for Fellaini won his duel or wait for good chance coming in. None of both goes to his way. martial were doubled on the left and for most part was isolated and useless. The rest were so poor to be able to pick up his movement or make any link up with him. Team overall is so average. A little pressure and final ball turns to turd.

1482~~~
He's going to be majestic. Needs someone to coach him to the next level. Fergie would have had a field day with this delightful fecker. 

Wouldn't read too much into his performance today. Only 18 and really shouldn't be playing all the time. Please God he's developed properly.

1483~~~
Indeed, he was making some clever runs but he's relying on the vision and creativity of Fellaini and Rooney from central positions to actually spot them.

1484~~~

1485~~~
Do people feel he should be first choice next season? If yes then it is incredible that a player a lot of fans knew very little about could have saved us over €50-60 million as we wouldn't need a big money striker signing.

1486~~~
No, or at least not automatic.

1487~~~
Id say he definitely should! It would take some turnaround (big money investments in the squad) to instantly be fighting for the league. If next season he becomes a regular starter then it will be incredible for his development. Plus he's looked more than good enough since he burst onto the scene. It's similar to Kane I think everyone wants him but that's because he was able to lead the line for two seasons. As you say we could save a huge amount of money with Rashford.

1488~~~
No, kelechi won't be first choice for city, and Rashford shouldn't be first choice for us, you need experienced players as well.

1489~~~
No but there are lots of games and if we are in the Europa league, he should be a good option in rotation. I guess that's partly when many are keen on Ibrahimovic, because he's not a threat long term - we could rotate him (well sometimes lol) and our younger lads can learn from his composure and a little arrogance. Most people didn't think Kane could replicate his form this season....so it would seem blind to say yes absolutely. Mind you Keane and Wilson are excellent options too. The main thing is we need to be scoring a lot more goals then we are. I'm sure that will come into any decision.

1490~~~
He can play out wide in a 4-3-3. If we played with a high front three, they could all interchange.

We definitely need a replacement for Rooney's old output.

In a dream world:

1491~~~
Technically he isn't fantastic to my eyes but you can see the confidence growing in him with every game so there's clearly something to work with there. His link up play with Martial, Lingard, Mata, etc is getting much better and he appears to be much more willing and more skillful in taking players on which is a delight to see.

His goalscoring record speaks for itself, absolutely magnificent.

1492~~~
We need another attacking player or possibly 2 for competition and rotation but if he's in form he should be playing. We don't want to be reliant on him (we have seen players have good seasons and regress before) but the way he has played so far warrants him being given the chance to be our main striker I think. Plenty of players have been close to their peak at a young age so whilst I think young players need a break now and then I don't believe in wrapping him up in cotton wool. If he's good enough play him.

1493~~~
Not really. I want him to play quite a lot (something like 15-20 starts and coming off the bench regularly), but I tend to think he's not quite ready to be the true first choice. However, he's done well enough that I don't feel that position is the single most important role to purchase a top player for (which is how I felt before his emergence). Similar to how Blind has done at the back actually. I do want an 'upgrade', but they've done well enough that I wouldn't be particularly disappointed with them being first choice next season as long as we make the right transfers in more important positions.

1494~~~
He doesn't need to start next year, and he shouldn't be. Deffo should be an impact sub or rotational player. Our squad is very thin and we definitely could do with back ups. I am sure he wouldn't mind.

1495~~~
The trouble is, who is available?

1496~~~
I think we'll use him like Iheanacho next season.

1497~~~

1498~~~
dont think we used Iheanacho

1499~~~
Possibly my favourite non-United player of all time, bloody loved the tubby genius when I was a kid.

1500~~~
I dunno to be honest, but that's the job of our scouting network surely? We could always go for Kane/Ibra. Selling Chicha was stupid, but we could always play Martial up top and get a left winger in because Memphis can't be relied on.

1501~~~
But who are the scouting team going to pick up? Whoever they pick up isn't going to have as much experience in the Premier league as Rashford, so his tender age becmes abit irrelvant, they'll be coming in greener than Rashford currently is. No chance of getting Kane and it'll be a stupid to bring Ibra in at this stage. It's fine looking for another winger but we'd be moving our best player out of his best position for a player who am or may not work.

1502~~~
we could just sign chicha back if it was that stupid? 45m should do it?

1503~~~
depends who is manager, mourinho and there's 0 chance

1504~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://metro.co.uk/2016/05/05/ronaldo-manchester-united-forward-marcus-rashford-reminds-me-of-myself-5863424/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://metro.co.uk/2016/05/05/ronal...marcus-rashford-reminds-me-of-myself-5863424/</a>

1505~~~
Wonderful endorsement. Hope Rashers goes on to emulate him.

1506~~~
Sky really is the limit for the guy, he just needs to learn how to pro act in the box like Ruud/Hernandez, and deal with the physical battle with CB's better. Apart from that you couldn't ask more of him as a striker.

1507~~~
He's achieved a few things this season. He's scored important goals. He's scored one against City and two against Arsenal. He's scored home and away. I think he would do even better with CBJ playing as i'm not sure the quality or timing of the crosses are as good now as when he was in the team. Players should be whipping them in early for the strikers - providing they're in the box. But that's nice words for Rashford. We can't get a head of ourselves though. He will have to keep scoring goals because in this team a lot of players miss to many chances. It's a great start for him though.

1508~~~
Gotta be chuffed with that. Look forward to him going on loan next season and following his progress. A couple of years of solid first team football at a Championship promotion hopeful (or EPL lowbie) and he will definitely be ready at a perfect time for Rooney's crossroads point. Coming up aces for him at the moment.

1509~~~
That would be the worst thing to do imo.

1510~~~
Send him on loan?... Surely he's proven that he is ready for first team football no matter what the grade? It would be stupid to not send him on loan. Having him play for the 21's and possibly make 15-20 sub appearances (I am talking about Van Gaal, as it is a total dice roll what happens if a new manager comes in it is hard to speculate what will happen) would be pointless. He should be playing regular football at a club where he is first choice and can have a proper impact.

I really highly doubt it will be at United. It would take some serious balls to stick with him as our first choice 50 game a season striker next season. (LVG staying) One has to surmise that playing a lot of games at 19/20/21 with a view to return to our fold when Rooney is 34 and on his way out of the club or guaranteed to take a backseat role due to age.

1511~~~
He will be needed if we're in the Europa League, we could end up with potentially 50+ fixtures next season. No matter who we bring in there'll always be game time and injuries around him. He would be a wonderful option to bring from the bench (something we've lacked) and even start against slow defences or if our striker is on a bad patch of form. Rashford in some form will always be needed for us.

We've got a lot of youth prospects coming through at the same time, best thing to do is to let them fight for spots and prove their hunger. Loaning them off would send the wrong message. Having young players fight for their places has been the best part of this season for us. 

EDIT: He also seems to be building a bond with Martial on the pitch and the likes of Lingard off the pitch, why loan him when he's integrating and on the whole, playing so well?

1512~~~
If any other manager comes in, my spectulation changes completely. Van Gaal doesn't do rotation at all (he could get lucky with injury rotation again if he is close to the fold but you'd have to speculate at least another one or maybe two top class players are going to be added to the squad before next season starts), plus my gut wants me to see him moved away for fear of being Vangalized like a few of our other first team players.

1513~~~
He should stay here, he's good enough.

1514~~~
When was the last time we sent someone out on loan and benefited from it?

1515~~~
Lingard maybe?

1516~~~
No. He is simply not a £50-60 million striker. Anyone who does think that are just being emotional. His talent is there to see. However we need more games to see whether he is at the Michael Owen, Torres, Fowler level (at 19 Fowler scored 25 league goals and therefore one of top strikers in the entire league). I have no issue with him being a back up striker as the guy is 18 and was going to spend another season in the under 18's and possibly under 21's last season but for the injury crisis

1517~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1518~~~
If he did what he has done this season at Lille or Rennes we would all we wanking off at the thought of signing him for 40 million.

1519~~~
Not me pal. Now way. I am against us spending this much of our budget on Sanches or anyone. Plus I doubt we would be wanking off as he has about 7 league goals to his name

1520~~~
That's so true <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1521~~~
That's not really true, some muppets would but between the posters who thinks that everyone playing outside of the PL is a subpar talent and the stingy fans, a good part of the board would be against his purchase. Now Rashford looks like a great talent and we probably won the lottery.

1522~~~
He's averaging 1 in 2 and has scored the winner at the Etihad, he's been absolutely brilliant!

1523~~~
sorry its 4 league goals. Yes he has started his professional career well but that's it. It has just started. imagine a world where every youngster who "starts" well gets £40 mill price tag? At the very least let him do a season or 2 like Lukaku

1524~~~
Lukaku's a donkey!

1525~~~
It isn't true at all because those people aren't to be taken seriously.
James Wilson?... Going on loan isn't just about doing well on the pitch, it encompasses a whole range of football development tools. In Rashford's case he's clearly shown he can be first choice at a club. (That is probably something Wilson was <i>just </i>behind in his development) It would be about how to establish himself at a club and learn to gain first team experience in a less harsh climate. A single or a couple of year long loans would really benefit him at this stage of his career. A promotion hopeful in the Championship maybe? Or a coup type loan for one of the newly promoted teams?

1526~~~
He is worth at least a million billion Renato Sanches dollars.

1527~~~
Put him out on loan and bring back Wilson as backup. Rashford has a very bright future ahead of him, I wouldn't waste him on our bench when he could be getting full game time every week with another team.

1528~~~
What the fcuk?!?

He plays for our first team and looks fcuking good, why would we loan him?

1529~~~
So if the first team striker got injured we will rely on Wilson as our goal scorer. While Rashford is scoring for fun at his loan team, we are struggling and out from Champion League once again because we make a stupid decision. Is that what you want? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1530~~~
Why is this even a debate?  Rashford should remain with the first team next season, coming off the bench and starting depending on the circumstances.  Some matches he won't play at all.  Some he'll play the full 90+.

Problem solved.

1531~~~
Christ lighten up, it was a clearly a joke you miserable bastards. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1532~~~
Ibra*, Martial, Rashford and Rooney.

Decent strikeforce next season.

<span style="color: #000000">*or Griezemann or Aubameyang (if you're a deluded muppet)</span>

1540~~~
Thank feck we have him. Imagine how shit we'd be feeling right now with Martial out. I'd have no hope for this team to score against West Ham.

1541~~~
No threat at all tonight.

1542~~~
He's had some good touches out wide. Struggling to get involved centrally though.

1543~~~
Can't put any blame at all on the young lad.

It's only through Van Gaal's sheer incompetence we have had to turn to an 18year old to play almost every game! No top clubs do that!

1544~~~
We don't look too pretty with him playing!

1545~~~
Great work from him to take down the long pass and play Mata in, who set up the goal.

Should I be shocked that our one real penetrating attack came from a long pass over the top?

1546~~~
I have no criticism for an 18 year old who is being asked to do way too much due to an idiot manager that left us so thin up top, His part in the goal was class and I am confident he will progress well for us.

1547~~~
Thought he was really important in our two goals today, seems to have a good maturity on the ball. It's a shame that most of the time he's chasing pointless punts down the channel, we need to get him involved on the ball more and stop isolating him physically against bigger guys.

1548~~~
Poor tonight but he's 18 so only ourselves to blame for expecting him to carry us.

1549~~~
If we had another right forward as good as Martial, and a decent midfield behind them I'd be fine with Rashford starting next year. 

But we don't.

1550~~~
Well, the lone striker system in LVG's tactic will always struggle when you don't have 2 players like martial stretching the defense arounds.

1551~~~
I thought he did ok. Involved in the moves for both goals, nice back-heel that got deflected, decent pass for Martial's weak penalty claim. Lost possession a few too many times. Missed a chance to get a header in.

1552~~~
This is why I find it baffling that people think we should not sign a striker not season. He's had a good start, but no way should he be a regular for us.

1553~~~
If we get a right winger that actually does something he will improve a lot more. A lot of teams play with inverted wingers who get a lot more involved in the build up so hopefully that happens, because it'd make use of Rashford's good flicks and intelligent movements.

1554~~~
Loved his involvement in the two goals tbh especially the first one.

1555~~~
He'll benefit more with players running into the box. We barely have enough as it is.

That chance he created when he backheeled it across the goal was begging for Rooney/Herrera/Mata/etc to charge in and slide it home.

1556~~~
Fecking poor tonight. Offered nothing in behind and kept coming towards the ball.

Needed much more movement from him today especially when Mata is on the wing.

1557~~~
tbf, every one would. We don't do it often enough this season.

Even Rooney will look good if we have runners.

1558~~~
Young lad, weight of expectancy to carry us to a win tonight. Won't blame him. As I've said in other threads, he needs to be developed properly. In 3 years time is when he should be leading the line, not now!

He has the talent but, he needs to be nourished properly, not just thrown in and told "here, CL football is riding on you getting goals. Oh and btw, you have school tomorrow"

1559~~~

1560~~~
It'll be interesting to see which turns out the biggest success in the next few years.

Both huge talents, and not too dissimilar in style, however Iheanacho does seem to have better dribbling skills than Rashford. Wonder who would win in a foot race.

1561~~~
Can hardly blame him for anything yesterday, we offered nothing going forward and he shouldn't be expected to create something out of nothing every game.

1562~~~
Welbeck's loss is Rashford's gain?

1563~~~
I'd take him personally, if its between Walcott and Rashford then its a no brainer. Hes a wildcard that defences wont know much about and even if he doesnt play he will benefit hugely from the experience.

1564~~~
If only we had Iheancho as well. Could have had the most promising young strike force in the world.

1565~~~
If it's a striker choice then likely to be between Defoe, Sturridge and Rashford.

If it's between Walcott and Rashford then it's likely to be for the wide right slot where England don't have that many options right now.

1566~~~
Forget positions as England have a lot of versatile players, for one Rashford should be able to play RW anyway as he has for Utd before, it's about quality and Walcott is shite whereas Rashford is a wildcard.

1567~~~
Iheanacho vs Rashford could be an exciting personal rivalry.

1568~~~
I'm sorry if it offends any England fans but get lost Roy. He needs a proper rest this summer for United. He's been threw in the deep end with united this season, knowing uniteds luck he will get a bad injury while training with England without playing a game. He's still adjusting to playing at senior level, he hasn't even played six months. Too much to soon, I hate international football. If it was the Republic of Ireland I would say the same thing. I only am thinking of uniteds best interest.

1569~~~
I think hes just training with them isnt he? dont actually think this is suggestive of him ending up on the plane to france. Didnt he do the same thing before the world cup with some other youngsters? just to let them get a sense of the environment..

1570~~~
That a U18 or U19 or U21 player trains with the first team happens on club level and on national team level........there will be not article if Redmond or Watmore are doing the same next week.

1571~~~
You have to also consider that Wayne Rooney is guaranteed to go, despite Hodgson likely being aware that he is no use to anyone up front. So one of the striker slots will be effectively going to a midfielder already, so cover up top is needed.

1572~~~
Is Rashford a one in a hundred talent or is he an example of a youth player taking his chance. Like do people think if most clubs gave their youth players a chance, they could do what he's done? I had seen nothing of him in the youth set up.

1573~~~
Seems to be named in the provisional England squad.

1574~~~
He could get in because of Englands lack of decent wide options.

England would be better with him than Walcott

1575~~~

1577~~~
Even if he didn't get a minute of game time I'd be really happy if he went. Would be good experience.

1578~~~

1579~~~
He'd do well at the Euros imo. Still plays with a pace, trickery, and fearlessness that England could benefit from. Same with Alli.

1580~~~
He won't make the 23 man squad, but the experience of meeting up and training in an international setting will do him some good.

1581~~~
He'll only make the squad if Sturridge gets injured, so I give about a 97% chance of making it.

1583~~~
A young player having that awareness after being starved of any service is great to see.

What a waste of time it is for him in all honesty. Not one player looks for him. No one plays to his strengths.

1584~~~
Very exciting player, but the England call-up is very premature, even for the provisional squad.

He's got pace in abundance, impressive movement and clearly an eye for goal, but I can't help but feel he's still a bit physically lacking. Tall, but could be a bit bulkier.

1585~~~
Great finish for his goal.

1586~~~
Great finish for the goal. Well done Marcus.

Who said he wasn't pacy? That was a funny one. He's lightning quick. Great composure as well. Looks quite strong for his age

1588~~~
Such a great talent, hope he doesn't go to the Euro's and has a well deserved rest over the summer

1589~~~
Did someone actually say he's not quick?

He's probably the fastest player in our team.

1590~~~
Can't believe how lacking in confidence he looks. A complete shell of the player he looked on his debut, hopefully a new manager will fire him up again.
<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">Am I doing it right?</span>

1591~~~
He's such a bright player, his finishing is excellent, his movement is excellent, his awareness is excellent. What I'm trying to say is, he's excellent.

1592~~~
maybe if he had "rooney" or "Mata" on his back players would try to pass to him, it's just annoying to see him making so many runs not receiving a single pass. Nice little dummy for the first goal and well taken goal.. hopefully he will bulk up over summer and come back even stronger, its a big surprise for me in terms of his athleticism, coming basically straight from U18s and keeping up with the tempo of the game for 90 minutes in majority of games is really impressive, think he can be a top player if he stays fit and continues developing, so young and already useful player to have.

Imagine if we had someone like fabregas pulling the strings he would have much more chances to score a goal. The slow tempo doesn't really suits him but he did well despite that

1593~~~
Spot on. The biggest change for next season has to be finding players who want to play through the lines and get the centre forward involved. He makes so many runs but the guys behind him only look sideways.

On the odd occasion we slip a few passes behind their midfield we look good.

1594~~~
Someone said he had a decent turn of pace, but that he hasn't shown that he is properly fast. He's up there with Martial, Shaw and Valencia with Smalling as a dark horse. Would like to see a race between them - one with the ball and one without like they did with Lennon, Agbonlahor and Walcott (not against each other, but against the clock).

1595~~~
He'll put on a bit of muscle over the next few years but he's quite wiry now. He just needs a less useless ref to call the fouls on him.

1596~~~
Worked hard, smart dummy for the 1st goal and took his own with a clean finish.

1597~~~
You should try using a thesaurus. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1598~~~
He really knows how to shoot inside the box, doesn't he?

1599~~~
I think he outshone Josh King tonight.

1600~~~
8 goals in what a third of a season? As a point of comparison, the most Welbeck ever got for us was 12 in 39 games. Hard not to get excited about the kid.

1601~~~
So many chances were being missed and I was hoping one would fall for him, knew he'd take it. Great finish.

1602~~~
Yeah, Rashford is what I'd hoped Welbeck would be.

1603~~~
Good: nice finish for his goal, intelligent dummy for Rooney's goal, and one run that resulted in shots for Mata and Lingard.

Bad: asleep when CBJ fired in a super cross, still guilty of drifting wide too much for my liking

1604~~~
What really excites me as well is that he's only been playing as an out and out striker for a year or two I believe? It feels like there's so much more to come from him.

1605~~~
yeah he was but perhaps that 50 runs before kinda tired him... ps how can you not drift wide when you cant get a decent ball all game..

1606~~~
Brilliant finish. Really knows how to ensure a good connection with the ball to have a good shot at goal consistently and that's a very good quality to have. Will learn a lot playing alongside Ibra next season as well. Will likely get loads of playing time next season. Won't be a starter but will have plenty of time as an impact sub or rotating in now and then as the starter to rest Ibra/whoever. He's only 18 so he shouldn't be a starter constantly anyway, but hopefully he's managed properly and Mourinho if/when he comes isn't afraid to use him properly.

1607~~~
My logic is that at some point in the game, Martial will explode past his marker, get into the penalty area and look for a pass. When that happens, I don't want Rashford outside the box. Same is true when Valencia looks to cross the ball, or Lingard.

1608~~~
He's bloody excellent.

1609~~~
Brilliant young player. Unlikely I think but do hope he gets the chance to go to Euro's.

1610~~~
His movement off the ball is very good for a player of his age. If he does go to the Euro's I just hope England take care of him and he doesn't get made a scapegoat.

1611~~~
He's class. The finish was excellent. His movement is naturally good. Got skills and pace a plenty. 

He's made this season almost palatable seeing him come through the academy.

1612~~~
He's just fantastic.

1613~~~
Ayone have a closeup vid/Gif of his total skinning of Gosling down the right ?

1614~~~
No chance of that.  IF he goes, he'll only get a few mins playing time, if that.  

But I hope he does go as the experience will enhance his skills and confidence so much.

1615~~~
Really impressed me today. Showed great awareness and contributed a lot in the buildup play. Bournemouth were awful in the second half but still hugely promising from Rashford. For me he was only just behind Rooney as MotM.

1616~~~
Imagine how he'd be with better players around him <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1617~~~
Lets no get too carried away.  Welbeck also had a great start to his United career.

I think what Rashford has proved this year is that he will not fall away like Macheda.  But he has 2 more solid seasons to perform if he is to propel himself into Rooney/Owen/Ronaldo type youth potential.  

Thats why I hope we do sign Ibra this summer.  He would be an amazing player to learn from and also take a lot of the responsibility and pressure off Rashford - its not right that our goalscoring responsibilities on on his shoulders.  Its that kind of expectation that could kill his career in its infancy.

1618~~~
Good game from him tonight. Took his goal very well, and his awareness for Rooney's goal was fantastic.

1619~~~
Do you know something about Ibra that we don't?

1620~~~
No way did Welbeck have a start to his career like this.

1621~~~
Yup, he didn't. He managed a grand total of 29 goals in 142 games for us - Rashford currently has 8 goals in 17 games.

1622~~~
Love this kid and his youthful exuberance. More impressed with his strength each time i see him- looks like theirs nothing on him but he's really tough- when he grows into his body he will cause nightmares if he carries on at this rate.

1623~~~
Rashford also doesn't fall down/slip over every time he gets into key areas.

1624~~~
I remember being pretty enthusiastic about Welbeck after 2011/12 and the Euros that summer.

The next season though his goalscoring return was awful, he had some good games but didn't he score about twice that season?

1625~~~
Would love to see that, it looked quite funny, think he didn't mean that, in the end it worked though

1626~~~
Yeah that's the big difference. He's got quick, agile feet.

Welbeck for all his virtues just can't sort his legs out quick enough.

1627~~~
He looks more confident. Tried to go past players more often. The only thing that he needs to work on is his positioning but he's 18 and that will come with time. Very excited by him.

1628~~~
Ya kind of feel buying a big name striker that relegates Rashford to the bench is a little unfair on him. If we do buy a striker then it should be Ibrahimovic or someone similar that wouldn't take up the striker position for a number of years, hampering Rashford's development.

1629~~~
I always found that the strange thing about Wellbeck because he's so good at the little flicks and tidy link up play but at the same time if he gets one on one there's about a 40% chance he will inexplicably fall over. Rashford has the neat flicks too but also great composure, I can't really think of a player he really reminds me of, maybe because he's quite maverick in his playing style.

1630~~~
He will defiantly go the Euros.

1631~~~
He's like a mixture of Brazilian Ronaldo and Ian Wright to me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Could quite happily play together, Rashford can play the right wing or use Ibra as a 10. Just depends how the manager want's to setup.

1632~~~
That's the thing. If we get a new striker then Rashford can play on the right because he'd be better at it than Lingard.

1633~~~
I don't see how he would to be honest. He'll relish going to the Euros. He definitely won't be defiant if he gets the call.

<span style="color: #ffffff">I do realise that I'm now a cnut for correcting spelling!</span>

1634~~~
Bertrand
Delph
Henderson/wilshere/drinkwater

1635~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Thanks for that.

Nah, but I'm pretty sure Roy will pick him.

1636~~~
Drinkwater has been consistently good for the champions of England and Bertrand is a back up. I agree with the rest.

1637~~~
Do you think him and Martial could be the front 2 in a diamond ala Cruyff?

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NZ0byEyeOA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

And as in the video if we get a top class 9 we just switch to 4-3-3

1638~~~
Clyne can play left and right back and stones can cover right back if need be. Bertrand not needed...

1639~~~
It is better to have players in their natural positions than other back up's playing out of their position. LVG has taught us that many a time this season (albeit contrarily).

1640~~~
Rashford has surprised me a lot since he came into the team, he had ability in the academy, pace, scored goals but his overall game never stood out, the most impressive thing is his mentality, he is confident, very confident, he knows what he can do particularly with his pace and he is not afraid to use it, it's a bit of whirlwind for him at the moment, remains to be seen how his game develops, have'nt seen him in enough match situations, he scored a cracker away to west ham in the cup, but his most impressive moment for me was winning the derby away, did his man and slotted home confident as you like in a match like that, also liked his reaction after scoring against bournemouth, great finish, but his reaction was low key, great mentality.

1641~~~
I think he needs to be doing more this game. 10 seconds of good football is not enough. For the first 30 minutes we had the ball 80% of the time and he's just jogging around, not making any runs. When Rooney made the through ball to Rojo there was no one inside the box. There have been two other times where he's standing around the box when we're in a crossing position. Not aggressive enough for me and needs to do better.

He also needs to be better defensively. Smalling's yellow card could have been stopped earlier. After Rooney lost the ball he jogged after the player in possession, allowing him to make the pass to Wickham uninterrupted. With some half decent pressing he could have forced a pass out of bounds.

I'm not saying he's the worst guy on the pitch or anything it's just that we've had the ball so much and Dann and Delaney have had a very easy game because he isn't making them work.

1642~~~
Wtf? He's been our best player going forward...Fantastic talent!

1643~~~
Not in the first half. Did well for the Martial chance but was otherwise not involved and frankly didn't look bothered considering the game they're playing. Much better in the 2nd half if you care to watch him off the ball.

1644~~~
Yes he was. 

And didn't look bothered? Dearie me<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1645~~~
You high?

1646~~~
Doesn't know his football.

1647~~~
I expect more than a few touches in 45 minutes from a forward in a team that has the ball 80% of the time. His performance in the 2nd half, that's what I wanted from him.

1648~~~
I'll let him know.

1649~~~
Stamp looked deliberate from Cabaye on the angle BT just showed

1650~~~
This kid played great. Couldn't disagree with Snow more.

1651~~~
Good skill on the ball, but his movement needs a little bit more work. Early days still, but such a smooth operator for one so young.

1652~~~
He's going to be absolutely top class. 

We need to have a couple of years of him as second-choice striker - rotating with an established player and then taking up the mantle himself in a few years. Enter Ibrahimovic <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1653~~~
Some lovely moments from him today, created chances for Martial and Fellaini. Glad to hear the injury isn't serious.

1654~~~
Had a really good game just needed a goal to top it off. Shame about the injury. Cabaye is a horrible cnut and should face a ban. Was clearly deliberate.

1655~~~
Would be criminal to sign a striker to play ahead of him, he really is the real deal

1656~~~
He's fecking awesome i love him!

1657~~~
Just because we have a lot of possession does not mean that we are always camped in the opponent's half. Most of that possession is in our own half. Look up the stats, or you know, actually watch the matches.

He was making runs, but was ignored for the ball out wide, it is not a surprise that our strikers see very little of the ball, and that is down to the tactics. The same thing happened last season as well. He also defended well, why should he press when we are not a pressing team?? That is down to tactics again, our strikers rarely press.

1658~~~
I think we created 3 good chances whilst he was on the pitch, and 2 were entirely due to moments of brilliance from him. Tough for a lone striker against a team that defends so deep with so many, and he did a great job. My sole criticism remains that he doesn't compete for high balls, but that'll come.

1659~~~
I'd like him to go to France. As an unknown talent, with great potential, he could be very, very useful for England.

1660~~~
Thought the was our sharpest and most dangerous player today, shame about the injury.

1661~~~
He was great tonight.

1662~~~
We haven't seen what he's like as a super sub, he might be totally ineffective 

Give him the summer off he deserves it

1663~~~
Do you think he'd want to go to France? 

He's a kid living the dream. I would think he'd love to represent his country at a European tournament rather than having the summer off.

1664~~~
Was MOTM until he had to go off.

Top player in the making.

1665~~~
He drives at teams, hes not afraid and if a flick (or backheel) doesnt work, it doesnt stop him. Any news about the injury?

Really hope he gets game time next season (but wouldnt mind us signing one experienced striker for Rashford to work and learn from).

1666~~~
BBC said during the match that the club expect it to not be anything serious.

1667~~~
Ahhh ok. I read on Sky Sports that it was a knee injury but didnt see much more after that. If its not serious, thats good news for him.

1668~~~
It's becoming apparent that he's anything but a sudden burst of hot air that will quickly disappear. His decisionmaking, awareness and technique has been excellent in every game he's played. The way he consistently creates chances with his flicks and backheels shows that it isn't just dumb luck. It comes off far too often. His finishing is very good for his age too.

Future superstar if he keeps it up. Genuinely excited to see how far he can go.

1669~~~
His play for Martial's chance in the first half was brilliant. Went past the defender with ease and then made the right decision with his pass. 

He was also the one that passed it to Fellaini before he hit the bar. His link-up play is sensational.

1670~~~
That's what's most amazing about him, that he keeps going after trying these things and they don't come off. Also that he's not afraid to go right back to them again next time.

That's what was surprising about Memphis(and quite a few more young players who'd still be more experienced than Rashford), after a while things like that'd make his head drop and he'd turn to much.

1671~~~
The timing and weight of pass was sensational, I'll be amazed if this guy isn't first class he is showing some really promising signs.

1672~~~
The turn for the Martial chance was unreal, there aren't many players in the world that would instinctively try that, let alone pull it off.

1673~~~
I really hope we don't sign someone like Ibrahimovic, who will only serve to block Rashford's progress. He's demonstrated quite clearly that although he's not the finished article yet, he deserves a starting place.

1674~~~
If you just wait a moment and think what this 18 year old has achieve this season, the impact is greater than any young player I can remember. It's the context of his impact when you think of the backdrop of his achievements. This is not a player coming into a good Utd team and a team creating 15+ chances a game. Also he's scored goals in big games, different type of goals and already shown at 18 he can play as a targeted man, one of the most difficult things to do even for the most seasoned player. You have to also remember physically he's still growing and will be stronger and quicker....

When you think we paid 50m for Martial, I put this lad potentially right up there and if LVG has played any part in this, this will be greater than winning the FA cup IMO. We may have two prongs of our own trident. Honestly I think they could be that good.

1675~~~
My favourite thing about Rashford is that he already gets the ironic cheers treatment from opposition fans when he fecks up, he's been around 3 months and he's already got them that worried about what he can do. His work-rate is really great as well, there was one point when we lost the ball attacking, he ran all the way back to RB, nicked it back then made a run all the way down the right wing as an option. It's stuff like that why I still think even if we do bring Mourinho in, Rashford still has a great shot at playing. His vision for a young player is very refreshing too.

1676~~~
He had a nice layoff to Mata at one point just outside the opponents box which woulda made an awesome goal, just that Mata didn't expect it.

1677~~~
Best player on the pitch before the injury, Palace defenders couldn't get near him. Hope the injury is not serious, he could be awesome for England

1678~~~
Brilliant player. Ridiculously instinctual, his intelligence at such a young age is what excited me the most. The kid has bags of potential and I don't think the pending appointment of Mourinho will effect him if he keeps it up. When you're good enough, you're good enough.

1679~~~
I was wrong and I think he should be an option for England. Maybe not as a striker but maybe he can still do a job on the wing. He deserves it and I think he would be a really good wild card option.

1680~~~
I love his little flicks and layoffs. Been a while since we had a CF who could do that. 

As he develops, I hope the physical side of his game progresses as well.

1681~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>for an 18-year old, I loved how he tracked back once and won the ball back, was pretty instinctive and he believed he could win the ball and did it.. He has a potential to be a full package one day

1682~~~
He has been literally brilliant so far. He seems to have so much to his game, it will be interesting to see which position he ends up playing in. 
He's obviously great at playing up front on his own. But, imagine him with a proper number nine giving him space to play off? I could imagine Rashford dominating as more of a second striker just because his skill and pace is deadly. 
Something like 
---------number 9
---------------------Rashford
Lm-------CM-------CM----------RM
Could work brilliantly for him, it would take the goal scoring pressure off as well. 
He could even play on the right side of a 433 but I think if he played like that or even as an "attacking mid" he'd excell. 
Him and Martial will hopefully be here for years.

1683~~~

1685~~~
Please, Mourinho, give this lad his chance...

1686~~~
He might start for England tonight.

"I would have preferred to have avoided all the headlines that will come with a debut at such a young age and after such a meteoric rise, but I can't do that without either lying or trying to disguise intentionally with some sort of fog. <b>At the moment, it looks like he'll be starting.</b>"
What a few months it has been for him.

1687~~~
I've only skimmed through the last few pages but....

Are people honestly thinking Mourinho, is going to sideline this guy, for no other reason, except that he's young?

Mourinho is finally at a club, where it's vital youth is given a chance.....I'd be the first fella to stick the boot in if he didn't but....Seriously....You really think Mourinho is stupid?

1688~~~
Yeah, the idea that rashford will be frozen out is silly. 

Mourinho will not keep such a thin squad such that he has to rely on youth so much IMO. I expect him to blood less youngsters for that very reason. But those who have already shown their worth like rashford, CBJ and TFM will continue to get chances, even if it is in the EL and league cup. It's the McNair, Blackett types - who honestly aren't and never will be good enough anyway - who will suffer. Mourinho will play a below average senior player than hopefully throwing in fringe youngsters. I have no problem with that. But players who are good enough and have undeniable talent will get their chances.

I think Rashford will likely be the backup striker, tbh. Zlatan, rashford, then Rooney or Martial depending on other injuries/circumstances.

1689~~~
Agreed. Although, I wouldn't be surprised to see Rooney’s star fall this summer with both England and United.

I still find this whole Rashford/Mourinho thing incredible <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

He's not going to toss him aside because he's young.... However, I hope he doesn't play him consistently. I want this magnificent cnut to lead United for years.. I want him to become the face of the club..I dont want him to burn out by age 25. I wanna see him develop properly

1690~~~
What do you think this guy would be worth if he was breaking through at a club like Everton? I'd imagine the big clubs would probably wait to see how he did for another year before coming in with huge bids. We're so lucky to have him with us <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1691~~~
Full debut tonight, hope he blows up!

Good luck Rash lad <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1692~~~
must be so excited

1693~~~
The lad seems to be universally liked and rated, it's odd.

1694~~~
Can't wait to see his England debut tonight. Excited for him. C'mon kid!

1695~~~
Beginning to wonder if Zlatan coming in could mean we play 442 with Rashford and Zlatan uptop sometimes

1696~~~
Great goal, inside 3 min

1697~~~
What a start! And I didn't even want him on the team <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1698~~~
What a start!! We have a superstar.

1699~~~
Apparently he "Sides foots it into the goal."

1700~~~
Rashford for the Euros!

1701~~~
He's got a better international goals per game ratio than Messi, Ronaldo or Pelé.

1702~~~
He's one of our own <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1703~~~
Where the feck did he come from. Looks like he might become our Harry Kane.

1704~~~
He's just awesome.

1705~~~
What a story he's become!

1706~~~
Such a shame that Mourinho's going to ruin his career.

<span style="color: #ffffff">White text</span>

1707~~~
I would bet my house that he goes to the euros.

1708~~~
Mourinho better not feck this lad up.

1709~~~
Didn't take him long did it

1710~~~
Hero.

1711~~~
Yup, he's going to the Euros.

1712~~~
Give him a chance Christ <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Edit, git <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1713~~~
People get it wrong. Mourinho is going to take ALL the credit for making him a world beater.

1714~~~
Wikipedia has already updated

1715~~~
So this was decisive game for him and he settles it in 3 minutes. Not bad.

1716~~~
Does he have any weak points?  Because all I've seen him do is tuck in goal after goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1717~~~
Can he head the ball?

1718~~~
Scored with his first shot on his United debut, PL debut and England debut.

I'm not even sure he's had the chance to yet.

1722~~~
So I'm not the only one, I don't remember him heading the ball with the U18 or the pros.

1723~~~
Eh .. Arsenal.

1724~~~
Big weakness: score too early. <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/> Imagine parking the bus for 87+ minutes under Mourinho. Not quality enough.

He scored a header against Arsenal.

1726~~~
I reckon his nose probably makes him less aerodynamic then he could be.

1727~~~
Any weak points?!  He gives the ball away about half the time he gets it... great finisher but his overall game needs a lot of work.  He's a kid though so you'd expect that.

1728~~~
I completely forgot.

1729~~~
Not bad..

1730~~~
That's goals in his European, League and international debuts. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1731~~~
Wow! This lad makes me happy.

1732~~~
Mourinho is going to improve this guy, times 10! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

And that's before Zlatan starts influencing him.....

1733~~~
Lad!

1734~~~
Having him learn from ibrahimovic is going to be brilliant. Really hope he kicks on and doesnt Have a januzaj type second year

1735~~~
Well played <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1736~~~
Great pass and movement before the goal. And another goal in the debut - such a shame that he can not have a debut every week

1737~~~
Reckon he'll get one tonight now.


Has he done that before tonight?  I've actually not noticed (probably because I've spent half of recent United games playing with the dog and not paying attention).

1738~~~
Luckhurst says FA Cup too...



EDIT - He's literally deleted it. Someone call him out on that part?

1739~~~
He's quality. He's like a young Antony Martial.

1740~~~
Probably. He's a bellend who tweets stuff for clicks/retweets before finding stuff out first.

Rashford didn't score on his FA Cup debut but did in the replay against West Ham.

1741~~~
Pretty much, but he has plenty in his favour.  The pace, unpredictability and fearlessness of youth.  He has bags of talent.

But if you were to compare him to Martial for example who generally makes the right decisions, looks composed and plays with maturity beyond his years... there's a big difference.

1742~~~
Not his best game thus far apart from the goal. Was almost a cert he'd score tonight though!

1743~~~
Think he's a bit of an OGS myself in style and personality. 

I hope he maintains that humbleness and doesn't learn from Depay

1744~~~
I reckon he'll come on leaps and bounds.  Like I mentioned before, he's unphased by it all but not in a bad way.

1745~~~
Got to go to the Euros, he's in form, clearly has a big future, so even being around it will be great experience.

Delph is out, so that leaves 2 to trim. You'd have thought 1 mid and 1 striker, but I wonder, as Rooney counts more as a mid now...so maybe we can lose 2 mids instead.

Surely a huge risk to take all of Henderson, Wilshere and Sturridge, who have all missed tonnes of games

1746~~~
We should only sign one striker, signing two would stifle his growth. Now I'm all for Ibrahimovic, given his age, Rashford would be able to grow effectively. 

I would actually be fuming if he signed two strikers.

1747~~~

1748~~~
Sir Marcus Rashford.

1749~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> impressive

1750~~~
What a player he could be. Reads the game so well and has a great temperament.

I don't think Van Gaal brought us much, but even if he was lucky he uncovered a gem, continuing to play him was brave and it's really paying off. Credit where it's due.

1751~~~
Totally agree. The "unknown" factor is a big bonus. He'll not be as well known as others and arguably teams won't necessarily be prepared for him.

1752~~~
This "unknown" tag baffles me. He's been playing for the biggest team in the world for the last few months, everyone will know who he is, know about his pace and directness. Not many will have played against him but I don't think that really matters at this level, they all do their homework.

1753~~~
Arsenal.

The kid is amazing. Never seems overwhelmed by the occasion. Send him to the Euros.

1754~~~
Pretty bad game but scored and his dummy was important in the second.

1755~~~
Good finish. Bad decision making in build up to goal though. Poor first touches throughout the game. Worst overall performance he's put in for a while

1756~~~
Any video of the goal?

1757~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mdIQZ77WQVw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1758~~~
Was it brave, or would it just have been stupid not to play him when he obviously shone from the off?

If it hadn't been for that injury to Will Keane, following our 2 actual strikers both being injured (down to VG's ridiculous risk in having 2 main strikers for a whole season!), Rash would never have got near it!

1759~~~
He'll go to the euros.

Sturridge is going to miss out.

Delph, Townsend and Sturridge will miss out.

1760~~~
I think Roy'll pussy out of it.

Sturridge'll go. Probably get injured.

1761~~~
You two should be ashamed! 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cB5UEbu83b0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1762~~~
If he goes or doesn't go remains to be seen but he's definitely made sure he isn't easy to job now. Thought townsend was very bright when he came on and i'd like him to go.

1763~~~
Yeah, we mean apart from that.

1764~~~
I bet LVG will credit himself for that

1765~~~
Sturridge is the best finisher, he should go. (I'm not saying Rashford shouldn't)

1766~~~
He should do really, trusted him and gave him his chance to shine. Of course Rashford took the chances but LVG kept him going even when others were fit.

1767~~~
For me Rooney should be classed as a midfielder in the squad, which should leave us with 4 forwards in Kane, Vardy, Sturridge and Rashford.

1768~~~
One goal means nothing, Martial scored a header at some point but he isn't great at it, last season Martial also scored a goal with his left foot but it was a flaw in his game.

1769~~~
He tends to shy away from high balls coming into him at the moment, one of the main things he needs to work on.

1770~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i1xfuhsZqzs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1771~~~
What a story he's turning into. Looks like he has the making of a great player, and he is taking his chance exceptionally well.

1772~~~
He was 2/1 to go to the Euro's 3 days ago... was so tempted to stick a few quid on - wish I had

1773~~~
As I said - he was lucky to find him. 

My opinion - to stick with a kid, when the fans are calling for your head and the board desperate for top 4 is brave. It's about the only good to come from LVG's time here for me.

1774~~~
Another instinctive finish and could have a couple of assists, he's so relaxed it's almost eerie. He got caught out on a couple of dribbles but kept going at the fullbacks which showed his confidence. Jose has a couple of gems in him and Martial.

1775~~~
Jeez, it seems he's spent too much time watching DJ Khaled's motivational video with 'another one' part on a loop.

1776~~~
I thought he was poor. 

Took up poor positions, brushed of the ball easily and struggled to beat his man.

1777~~~
Can we get this kid signed up already? It's scaring the shit out of me

1778~~~
Next season will show what he's really made of. The talent is there, but now the toughest part begins.

1779~~~
Not sure we really need to worry about him leaving <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

And good grief at calling his performance poor.

1780~~~
I've read a few posts on RAWK about the tonight's game and all of them were about the media blast which will follow if Rashford scores tonight... and he scored. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Anyway, this guy reminds me a lot of Inzaghi. Not so much about the style of playing (Rashford certainly does not spend all of the time offside), but about the positioning. This young lad has one of the more important characteristics for a striker - he knows, or more likely feels, where to be while attacking. 

I hope he'll cope with the expectations for the next season, which are huge. I know he's still a kid having chemistry classes etc, but still.

1781~~~
He'll be ok! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1782~~~
Thought Wilson would be the new striker to come through, but than he came and surprised us all. Hope he is not a one season wonder and will get enough plaing time. Love him.

1783~~~
Almost no one outside of United had heard of him before his February debut, yet here he is scoring on his England debut 3 months later. What a story. What a fecking talent! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1784~~~
Let's hope Jose gives him some playing time

1785~~~
Do people really think this will be an issue?

1786~~~
Mourinho has to play him. He's in brilliant form. Rarely ever misses a chance.

1787~~~
I'm sure he will.

1788~~~

Perfect editing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Normally people are just editing the face but the guy included both hands as well

1790~~~
So he needed three minutes to score .... what took him so long???  Score from kickoff next time!

1791~~~
He's also selfish with a bad attitude.  Rashford should go because he's a team player and will make our club look better

1792~~~
Martial, Rashford and possibly IBRA up front!
Interesting!

1793~~~
Interesting, I'd say mouthwatering!

1794~~~
He's a special talent. Crazy how we probably wouldn't of seen him this season were it not for injuries.

1795~~~
He hadn't even played a game in the u21's. It was sheer fluke, miracle level luck.

1796~~~
And why not? Sure we had alot of injuries, but most other managers would've played some regular out of position as a striker. Had Fergie been as brave Pogba might've been with us now.

1797~~~
Cop on, pal.

1798~~~
I will as long as he's not signed to an extension. In 6 months he can sign with other clubs and these days you never know. If he keeps banging in goals he will not be without interest from other top clubs. Would hate to lose another one like Pogba.

Unless he's holding out on it himself we have no reason not to get it done as soon as possible.

1799~~~
I thought we had given him a raise. Doesn't a raise come with a contract extension? (Just a question, I honestly don't know if it was a rumour or if it was confirmed).

1800~~~
Man, what an exciting talent and story. The shot of Rooney looking proud on the bench was pretty good too!

1801~~~
This fecking place sometimes. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1802~~~
You reckon?

Jose has hardly made his career out of promoting youth.

1803~~~
He wouldn't be promoting Rashford, though.

1804~~~
I hope you're right because I think Rashford looks an exciting prospect.

However, he's still very young and will need to be protected next season, so I'll doubt he'll be a starter under Jose

1805~~~
As if the hype isn't already getting going a bit

1806~~~
So much better than Sturridge's reaction <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1807~~~
If we get Ibrahimovic, it will be hard to imagine where he will fit in. Mourinho preferred system is the 1-4-2-3-1, so he would most likely be on bench since he is not a wide player or a number 10.

If we adopt a 1-4-4-2 or a 1-4-2-2-2 then he will have a better chance to develop like Kane under Pochettino.

I can see this working for United under Mourinho. But with the amount of midfielders we have compared to our strikers, it will make little sense to implement.

1808~~~
I love this lad. I just hope he stays grounded, works hard and keeps the right attitude. If he does I'm sure he will have a very bright future.

1809~~~
I'd like to think so. He's not famous for promoting youth, but Rashford has already made a name for himself in the first team and is an England international as well. I can't really see Jose demoting him to a bench warmer or something. He persisted with Varane and Santon, so it's not all bad in that aspect.

I also don't think it'd be bad if Rashford takes a slight step back and doesn't start every single game for us as he's basically been doing since his debut. We need another reliable striker if we want to challenge on all fronts and Rashford would still get plenty of chances to start/play. He's a brilliant talent, but it wouldn't be a good idea to expect him to carry our attack along with Martial. He's still only 18 after all.

Signing Ibrahimovic would be great for the team and most of all - for Rashford. Ibra will be 35 soon and would only stay a couple of seasons at most at United and by that time Rashford should be even more ready to be a regular for us. He'd also be able to learn from one of the best in the game.

1810~~~
I love how loads of the opposition fans I see on other forums are incredibly bitter about his success. If he played for Arsenal or Spurs or Liverpool they'd be perfectly fine with him being in the England squad, but because it's us it's just wall-to-wall sulking. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1816~~~
Well deserved

1817~~~
That's wonderful news.. The article also talks about how CBJ is also on the verge of signing a new contract.. 

Good that we are tying them up to long contracts..

1818~~~
Quite remarkable that he has a show reel like that from just a few months of first team football.

1819~~~
it's quite impressive how he developed over past three months. From u18 to the first team, he would deserve to start ahead of most senior strikers in the league. He also keeps surprising me as Martial did who I though couldn't keep that initial form but kept that for so long that it became normal and even my expectations of him rose in the end. Rasher is like that now as well. He doesn't have bad games and always gets himself at least a goal or involvement in an attacking move. His touch could be better at times but it's quite normal for a player who had to take step from u18 straight to the senior team. His stamina is awesome for such a young player, something Wilson can only dream of  but he would need to stay fit first. I also admire his positioning and he doesn't seem just like a give and run striker. he's got football brain and exactly knows where his players are and most importantly knows where the goal is and will score which gives him very good chance to get minutes under Mourinho, he may not him use him as a primary striker, especially when we buy Zlatan but he could always use him as an impact striker for the last 20-30minutes and he could be deadly when super fresh against tired teams. Cant wait for the next season to see him tearing teams apart.

1820~~~
What a player he is shaping up to be. Some of his flicks and back-heels almost have an air of Berbatov to them. He and Martial should form a pretty lethal partnership in the future.

1821~~~
It's all happening for him. Great news on a new contract and really feel he'll become a United legend in the future.

not sure if it has been posted yet.

1823~~~
Excellent BBC!

1824~~~
Come the hell on! You insinuated that he doesn't or hasn't scored with a header at all! Martial is not too bad with headers either. The technique and power he got on his header that hit the post in the F.A. cup final was pretty impressive. Not doing it often (or not being presented with chances to do it often) does not mean he isn't good at it

1825~~~
No I asked a question, I genuinely don't know how good he is at heading the ball and I don't remember him heading the ball.

1826~~~
Fair enough. A few Martial hits

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnPP2bkrHGM?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Look at 2:46

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KKT_2MFh_Qk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1827~~~
I love Pardew's look away when Rashford made that stunning turn in the FA Cup Final around the 6:02 minute mark.

He really could form a brilliant partnership with Martial. Both incredibly dangerous.

He (and us actually) was also incredibly lucky that the string of injuries that hit our front line happened at the same time otherwise he probably wouldn't have had the chance he had against Midtjylland and Arsenal.

1828~~~

1829~~~
I think that's unfair

Ok I'm a Charlton fan but I think Rashford is a breath of fresh air

Great potential

However, he is young and needs to be protected 

As for Jose....I'm not sure he'll give him much

I hope I'm wrong, because I think he may be the real deal

Any problems with this disinterested view?

1830~~~
Noticed he's being line up in a wide right position in people's fantasy XI's for next season so I ask, didn't LVG already try that last season to terrible effect?

1831~~~
Yes and Mourinho wont

1832~~~
Not at all, what you've said is perfectly fair. But there's some people that are going for the "oh, the media are talking about Marcus 'better than Pele' Rashford again" or "England Saviour Marcus Rashford" over the top sarcastic approach to him. Like it's a completely new thing for a young player to come through and do well, and have that subsequent hype surrounding him. They're the ones I'm on about.

1833~~~
He played wide right for about half a game to one game max and was infact very lively. No reason whatsoever that Mourinho won't try that despite the poster above saying otherwise.

1834~~~
LVG played him as a deep right midfielder in one game. I would like to see him given some game time as a right inside forward to see how he does. If Jose allows the front three to interchange and/or gives Rashford the freedom to make runs in and around the box I think we will continue to see the best of him, if not he will get plenty of game time upfront as I don't think Zlatan will play every game.

1835~~~
Needs to bulk just abit to really annoy defenders, he already is a nuisance. I am concerned that it might take away some of his agility/change of pace tho.

1836~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vXFXLWyVzv8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1837~~~
Rashford debuts in a major tournament for england. Good on him.

1838~~~
Let's see how he does in the Martial-position!

1839~~~
Our boy doing fine!

1840~~~
Done more in 15 minutes than Sterling and Alli has done all match.

1841~~~
This may be an unpopular opinion but I think he is very poor technically. His dribbling awkward and more hoof and chase, his first touch is too heavy a lot of the time, he seems to trip over himself and lose track of the ball and he always gets the ball tangled in his feet when he does stepovers. Great finisher though

1842~~~
I do agree with this. He is still raw but has a lot of talent.

1843~~~
Agreed. But what one has to remember is where was every English striker talent bar Rooney and Owen at 18 years old? No one outside of MUFC even knew his name 10 months ago.

1844~~~
Nice cameo. Some lovely touches and had an immediate effect on the game.

1845~~~
I thought it was a good cameo. His obvious qualities are his off the movement and link up play.

1846~~~
He's gunna be a big player for us over his career.

1847~~~
Thought he was very good, happier with his all around play with every passing game.

1848~~~
Very very good.

1849~~~
Was a fantastic performance and for that he simply has to be ahead of sterling in the pecking order now.

1850~~~
Already better than Sterling and Lallana

1851~~~
Unreal. Guy will be one of the best in the world

1852~~~
Not so Breaking News: He's the dog's bollocks.

1853~~~
Better option than Lallana or Sterling even though he is out of position.

1854~~~
He played well. I love his ability to slip away from defenders.

1855~~~
Looks 10 times better than Embolo

1856~~~
No nerves. So happy he got his tournament debut. Has done well.

1857~~~
He's cool as ice. Can't wait for the season to begin so he can continue getting better and better.

1858~~~
Completely different outlet than what Lallana was. His pace open them up. The goal was always going to come if it wasn't from him someone else.

1859~~~
This. 

Rashford is different level.

1860~~~
Technically poor? Nah. His feet are far quicker than Sterling, who is simply all pace. Very good cameo. He must have earned the right to one of the main attacking subs going forward.

1861~~~
On the contrary, I think he has brilliant technique. At such a young age, with the amount of pressure that's on him, there's bound to be moments of heavy touches and the like, but he's shown so much that I have little doubt that his technique is anything other than good.

His shooting, dirbbling, passing, backheels and all round link-up play has been brilliant for us and, so far, good for England, too.

1862~~~
Gave a new dimension to the game and he's so much better than sterling you would think City payed 50m for him. Kept trying to take on the LB and his link up play was sensational. Must Start.

1863~~~
The last four months of this kid's life couldn't even have been written in Hollywood. From a complete unknown to representing his country in the Euros in less than half a year. Watch him score against Slovakia now to make the story even more incredible.

1864~~~
According to his coaches at youth level he actually has a lot of skills in his locker. There was a vid floating about on here a while ago of him scoring a few goals at a youth tournament where he created space for himself with a few lovely bits of skill.

You're right though, we haven't really seen that from him. His best moments have been when he's playing instinctively; the little give and goes, or the goal against city where it came to him quickly and he just glided past Demichelis.

I'm hoping as he gains more experience his composure during moments when he has more time on the ball will get better, and we'll see that side of him shine through.

1865~~~
I thought he did enough to make you wonder if he should be in the England starting 11. I've actually been impressed by Lallana, apart from his finishing, so not sure which of them should start. Sterling and Kane have been poor.

1866~~~
I think Mourinho is going to absolutely love what Rashford can do for the side.  I'm so impressed with his link up play, around the box, out wide, he has it in abundance.  I do hope Rashford can continue this form into next season as he and Martial are the kinds of talent that great teams are built on.

1867~~~
Rashford does have an inconsistent touch, however his link up play definelty makes up for that and his ability to actually take on the fullback and get ahead of them.

1868~~~
I hope Embolo coming in, if he does, has no affect on Rashford. I don't want to hype him up too much but I would much rather develop a youth player than a bought player.

1869~~~
If people can write stories about a dystopian future where we all live in a computer simulation and our bodies are grown by machines and used as as an energy source, they can probably write a story about a footballer playing well.

1870~~~
Should start ahead of Sterling \ Lallana. Give him the RW spot.

back four
rooney dier alli
rash vardy sturridge

1871~~~
He had Rose behind him who looked as though he'd pretty much given up by the end, Rose is so one dimensional you could tell he was going to square it at every opportunity. I thought overall Rashford did well and hopefully we'll see a bit more of him.

1872~~~
Don't want an expensive embolo to eat into his game time

1873~~~
Liked his performance, not so sure about the high praise he got here, but he did look good at moments (The Demicheles move for example) and looked inconsistent as well (His touch after the Demicheles move). I'm not sure if he should start the next game, but he should definitely be the first sub England bring on when Lallana's mileage is done. Just love this player though. Such an amazing kid.

1874~~~
They tried with Goal! Santi Munez only made it to Newcastle in his first year. Pretty shit in comparison.

1875~~~
Rashford just shows how important it is to be grounded and have a solid environment around you, and listen to advice.

I'd wager that Ravel Morrison was as talentet as Rashford, probably more, but poor off the pitch decisions and poor advice let him down.

1876~~~
There is nothing wrong in stockpiling promising young talents. 

But it's be an absolute disgrace if we spunk an absolute fortune on some kids while overlooking Rashford just because he came with a price tag of 0 and without a fancy foreign name! He isn't a typical English pace merchant. He's so much more to his game and his game intelligence is beyond his years.

1877~~~
It's the maturity in his play that impresses me. When others might try to make a name for themselevs he uses his smarts to keep it simple and do what is right. While it might not end up on YouTube, there's something very satisfying about watching him continually choose the right options....

...then on top of that there's these occasional little moments of magic where he abandons that caution and a touch or a back heel, or he stretches his legs and finds an acre to work in. 

It's that contrast in his play that makes him such a pain for defenders, they just can't figure out if they should hold off and contain him or try pressing him.

1878~~~
His overall technique is fine, his link up play and quick touches around the box should be enough to tell you that. He could do with improving his dribbling a tad mind.

1879~~~
Well done lad.

1880~~~
Completely unfazed. Kept asking for the ball. I don't even understand how.

1881~~~
Impressed with his wing performance.

1882~~~
He looks awkward when running with the ball. In comparison to martial or Kane (at Spurs) who are graceful when running with the ball and seems to glide past players.

But his first touch and passing is actually quite good.

1883~~~
Marky Rash Rash!

1884~~~
Controversial but although he had a very good cameo that sub by Woy was horrendous. Emphasizes how poor he is tactically.

1885~~~
I agree his lay offs and one twos are good. His first touch, dribbling and overall control don't look that good. Reminds me of Costa with his style.

1886~~~
Yeah bringing on a striker when you need a goal. Blasphemous

1887~~~
Your right it is unpopular, Rashford is technically very good. He is very good on the ball and without it. He's an intelligent player that creates great space for others. He can run with great speed on the ball and has scored a range of goals for United. Have you watched Rashford the last few months? His all around play is fantastic and he's only 18 and is going to get so much better in the next few years. I take massive offence to, as you call it 'hoof and chase'. There is so much more to is game. He's no donkey up front that can just finish, you make him sound like a league two player.Terrible post

1888~~~
promising, didnt disappointed at all was lively and I am chuffed for the guy, shame his touch was a bit inconsistent at times, that's one of the reasons he should be playing upfront on the other hand he's fearless and takes on players even though it's not his biggest strength, I'd say play him as much as possible his tenacity and confidence is key factor for England, not only his though hungry Vardy's goal also meant they're still in the tournament. Kane must have played over 60 games this season and looks really tired, would consider benching him next game. Alli as well, roy needs to refresh it a bit. ..from other camps Martial looks also tired

1889~~~
Not to mention Martial.

1890~~~
Kane? He is slow as feck. Agreed that Walker has great technique when running at the ball. Never seen Rashford carry the ball over distance though.

1891~~~
This lad has the talent to be one of the best players in the world. He's more talented than Martial in my opinion.

1892~~~
This is a very blinkered post. His dribbling is to use his 0ace to beat his man. He struggles to control the ball and carry it without it hitting the wrong foot or getting tangled up in his feet. His first time passes and lay offs are great but his technical ability is awkward and often times poor.

He pulls off those things due to his fearless and tenacious attitude. For every piece of skill or move he does is around at least three other failed attempts that were due to his poor technique. He has very good instints and movement. Just not good dribbeing or control.

I just watched him try and do a stepover and accidently kick the ball instead. Don't try and glorify him beyond his ability.

1893~~~
Horrendous? He impacted the game in a positive way... how is that horrendous?

1894~~~
Kane doesn't really look graceful does he ? Not saying he looks woeful either, just doesn't strike me as graceful when dribbling though.

1895~~~
You're clearly smarter than this. You don't just throw on all 3 strikers when you need a result. We unsurprisingly created zero chances after he came on & lost all fluidity.

A moment of genius & luck shouldn't erase the one paced & incredibly narrow team we saw for 30 minutes.

1896~~~
Didn't look fazed at all. Just came on and linked up the play nicely.

1897~~~
Great cameo, done himself no harm at all with that.

1898~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> are you sure you were watching the same match?

1899~~~
I can understand your point and the reasoning behind it and initially it did seem like England lost some momentum after he came on. But strikers playing out wide is very normal in International tournaments, and England were clearly dominating the game. They needed the win and had to throw caution to the wind. The only alternative to that sub would have been Wilshere for Alli. Besides, Lallana doesn't usually last more than 65-70 minutes. Was a logical sub in truth.

1900~~~
Not the pace. Was talking about how he gets past defenders more easily. Of course Kane is 22 and I have no idea how good he was at 18. Rashford seems to be clumsy in comparison however he actually can dribble past players (he did it once today too like martial does)

1901~~~
Wales were camped in their penalty area. Tactics kinda go out of the window. All of Hodgson's subs worked.

1902~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sG8iaAYWsnQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

In this game in particular I think his technique was poor. He did a lot right and his a great eye for a pass and reading of the game. Just his technical ability let him down quite a few times in this game.

1903~~~
The ball for the winning goal was supposed to fall to him, but Sturridge got in front of him <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1904~~~
Not true at all. It would have been the same had Roy made any other sub. Plus Rashford actually plays well out wide so he isn't the worse guy you can play as a LW. Plus he did nothing to show it was a bad cameo especially if you compare other youngsters like embolo martial coman and all when they came on in games this tournament.

1905~~~
I think Kane is clever in that he knows when to dribble, so he heavily relies on the opposition player's momentum to give him some space in moving forward. Rashford isn't a proper dribbler, but his awareness is just astounding. He almost instinctively knows, when to hold the ball up, when to bring others into play, how to bring them into play, when to take a risk. It's not always going to work in his favour throughout his career, but at this age, that's very impressive though. There are more than a few youtube videos of him at U16 and U18 level, his game was pretty unbelievable even then and that includes his dribbling skills as well.

1906~~~
It isn't a blinkered post at all. The lads just made his England debut at the age of 18 with a tonne of pressure so of course there's bound to be mistakes, but in saying that, he still produced more good moments than bad because he's an excellent prospect.

There's been countless times for us he's shown great dribbling, hold up play, passing and shooting which he wouldn't have been capable of doing if not for his brilliant technique. He came into a side so devoid of attacking intent and immediately made an impact. It wasn't like he was Macheda where he was playing in one of the best teams in the world at the time, he was making his own chances and just overall improving our play. You can't do that without a good level of technique.

I still remember his Tevezesque turn to get away from a couple of West Ham players in a tight away game. The technique he showed to do that, and subsequently lay off a nice pass to Lingard for a good goalscoring chance, was brilliant. He's not going to do that every game at a young age, but the signs are there.

1907~~~
You're clearly smarter than the England coaching staff. Wait, no. You're not. 
It was a good sub to chase the game. He's a very different player to Lallana and he proved a threat today in his cameo. I think you're just being controversial for the sake of it.

1908~~~
He looked very good today. Impressed and pleased for the lad.

1909~~~
Why are you uploading a video of him against Australia when he just played against Wales? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> 


And by the way his technique is fantastic. Without a doubt one of the most technically gifted young players in the world.

1910~~~
Love that film <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1911~~~
Did well, his lay-offs are so confident and he has great awareness for such a young player.

1912~~~
I'm just going off what I have seeno when I watch him. Every time I have seen him play he looks poor technically.

Also, many technically poor players pull off good pieces of skill on a regular basis. Costa being one of them ( Who I think he is very similar to)

1913~~~
I will when the highlights come out.

1914~~~
Blinkered post? No a blinkered post would be judging all his attributes in 17 minutes for England.I'm judging him over the last few months from watching him play. I don't need to glorify Rashford, he does that himself when he performs. Becoming the youngest ever player to feature for England at European championship next. It's infuriating to read posters making statements that haven't watched the player properly.

1915~~~
Is everybody in this thread on drugs? He isn't technically brilliant. Infestation is technically brillicit,  not Rashford. He clearly needs to improve on the technical side of his game. The rest is already there.

1916~~~
Fair enough. We'll just have to agree to disagree.

Personally, he reminds me of Tevez. I think because of the way he's built he looks awkward, but as he grows into his physique and matures in his play, he'll go on to be a similar player to the Tevez who was at City/Juve, not United. Hopefully even better, though!

1917~~~
I think you are confusing his technical ability with his dribbling mate. That does look rash at times. Technically, he seems fine, maybe not brilliant, but definitely above his peers I'd say. Having a few poor first touches etc is pretty much expected at his age.

1918~~~
Hes not brilliant its not poor either. Solid 6.5 or 7/10 though. Loose first touch at times is the only thing, but his passing is fine as is his finishing, dribbling and striking of the ball.

1919~~~
Strange comparison.

1920~~~
I think he did great today. In terms of the substitution, I think Roy made the right decision. Lallana has yet to score for England, and for all his running and efforts, never looks likely to score. Rashford has been banging them in playing multiple positions across the top of the pitch since his debut. I always think Rashford could score, he can create for others as well as get in the right places. Today he became our youngest International tournament debutant coming on in a game where we really needed to score-no pressure then!  
Apart from his very first touch he seemed composed, and didn't make any more mistakes than the experienced players on the pitch did. 
Made up for the lad, may his good fortune continue, England have some quality young lions emerging and he is well placed among them.

1921~~~
One of the worst posts I've seen. Complete horseshit from start to end.

1922~~~
If we're sticking with wingers in the next game, he should be starting over Sterling.

1923~~~
His touch and dribbling are wayward at times and show that he is - unsurprisingly - still a work in progress. But good cameo nonetheless, unafraid and unfazed, demanding the ball at every opportunity, and plays his team mates into good positions. Should definitely be ahead of Sterling and Lallana.

1924~~~
Control first touch and dribbling are the main parts of technical ability.

His control is poor, his dribbling reliant on pace and his first touch is erratic. I'm not sitting on the guy, just pointing out areas he needs to improve in to be world class.

1925~~~
I also think that Rashord is good with the ball at his feet. Love watching how those pair of long legs get around the ball, change of direction happens instantly. Throughout the match he kept his act together, no problems whatsoever, just playing and enjoying the game. There're different kind of strikers out there, in my view Rashord is fine coming on and occupying the wing. Roy doesn't always get it right these days but today he was spot on, credit where credit is due, imo. 

I will be left speecheless if Mourinho doesn't work his magic on Rashford. Even Balo was scoring goals for the Portuguese, just take a second and think of what he can do with Rashford. Glory, glory days! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1926~~~
I admit it probably is strange and I might be the only one who thinks this, but the way he goes about his play just reminds me of Tevez. His willingness to press opponents and work for the team, his tenacity in running at players and never backing out of a challenge, the way he uses his body to hold off opposition players, even the way he strikes the ball all remind me of Tevez.

I just recently watched our 07-08 season review a month or so ago, and seeing Tevez play there just made me think of Rashford, too.

1927~~~
Of course the guy who thinks Willian is crap would say that. Get over yourself.

1928~~~
Agreed. He is raw and weak with technique and at dribbling. Those need to be improved upon.

Good points? Very instinctive player who is always a second ahead in thought of the other players around him, is obviously very fast, he passes very accurately, is good with layoffs and one-twos, is a brilliant finisher and has excellent movement in the final third.

1929~~~
Think you are nitpicking tbh.

1930~~~
This is pretty much my assessment of Rashford.

No need for Akash to get all uppity about it because I didn't tow the line to suck Rashfords dick.

1931~~~
They are not the only parts which goes into defining technical ability either. And usually dribbling is never paired with Technique. For example Scholes had excellent technique, heavenly, but would you say he was a good dribbler ?

That's why I just think you've intertwined the two variables. His dribbling can do with improvement, I agree and yeah some of his first touches can be a little loose as well, I won't deny that, but his ability to lay off a ball (like those lovely flicks he likes to do) or strike a ball (I think it was the Villa game was it where he struck one on the half volley ?) should be considered as part of his technical ability as well and they are really good for his age group. Sturridge fluffed his lines today trying a half volley as well and he's considered as someone with excellent technical ability and he's much older than Rashford. So it happens, hardly a surprise that he's not perfect. Rashford could do with improving his jumping abilities as well, despite being somewhat tall if he's going to play as a striker especially.

1932~~~
Great come back<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Very poor technically, poor dribbler, heavy first touch, trips over himself and loses track of the ball. I don't know who that is (Falcao?) but it most certainly is not Marcus Rashford. What a load of shite.

1933~~~
Rashford reminds me of Muller. Seems very awkward on the ball. 

I'm not denying his shooting,  layoffs and flicks aren't good. Just don't think his control, first touch and dribbling are.

1934~~~
He does need to improve his technique, and I would expect he will over time. Can't think of many eighteen year olds that don't have to improve. He does have solid technical foundations to build on though. When he may stumble on the ball, or misjudge a dribble, I think it's more down to youthful exuberance, and his desire to get going rather than clumsiness or lack of technique. His judgement will only get better, and then we will see an even better Rashford. Fantastic prospect, wouldn't be surprised if he went on to be one of the worlds best, and we will be behind him all the way.

1935~~~
There were many points this season where he showed his dribbling to be very proficient - mirroring the martial dribble past a defender to the byline and lay it back. I think he more tries to much at times rather than being a bad dribbler. His control I think is a mixture of slight nerves and him coming to terms with his size

1936~~~
That's an interesting comparison. 

And ffs, I typed so much, and you comeback with what you said in the first post. I'm not discussing with you anymore. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/> <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>.
Yeah, there are aspects of his game which he needs to work on, hopefully, we will see improvements on them.

1937~~~
He's spot on. Toothless player who has an inflated reputation because of a very brief purple patch on Free-kicks. Been dreadful since Jose's sacking.

1938~~~
I'm not going to get into childish insults with you. Nor am I going to arrogantly insult people's posts because they disagree with me. 

Its not a load of shit. I have seen him multiple times trip over the ball and nock it out of play. I have also seen his heavy touches, miscontrol the ball and over hit it when dribbling with the ball. In my opinion he needs to improve those areas of his game.

Stop acting like your opinion is fact and maybe differing opinions won't upset you so much.

1939~~~
Scholes wasn't very fast and had poor agility so couldn't beat a man. His dribbling and control when dribbling was still impeccable.

Sturridge has quite poor shooting techniquemail.  He scuffs the ball a lot and struggles to get power on it. His finishing is good though.

1940~~~
No way will Sterling be starting the next game. Be surprised if we see him again in the tournament. Sturridge and Vardy will probably be ahead of our Marcus though.

1941~~~
Needing to improve on areas was a reasonable and obvious opinion. He's only 18 after all albeit one of the best young talents in the world. Making him out to be someone akin Titus Bramble playing up top is a preposterous opinion and deserves ridicule. Sorry if that offends you but it's true.

As for childish insults, I didn't bring up Willian in an shit attempt to do...not sure what was intended there tbh. Willian is hugely overrated after all and currently leading Brazil to glory.

1942~~~
What a load of rubbish. For an 18 year old, his control, first touch and dribbling were mostly fantastic last season.

1943~~~
Congratulations to Rashford on his debut in an official tournament. It was interesting to see him in the 'Martial' role. He skinned the lb a couple of times and showed good close control. Looked a threat.

1944~~~
Scholes was just bloody clever. He knew how to beat a man even when he didn't he have the legs to do so. And I don't think he was as slow at the start of his career (Though I was not a United fan back then). But if you put him on the wing (I think he played there for England didn't he?), he'd probably struggle beating his marker. It doesn't make him a good dribbler though, just a really clever player.

I'd disagree. Sturridge has good technique. He was excellent in the Slippy G season technically and even after that (Though that wasn't much). He's just a very selfish player and he wants to do everything himself. If he was bit more of a team player, you'd not doubt his technical ability, but that would mean that he wouldn't be as ruthless in front of goal.

1945~~~
Honestly I'm not sure what people are watching at times. Technically very, very good. Think about what your watching, 18 years old. Look at the technique of the goals in big games he scored. Look at his link up play. I thought today he was obviously nervous but some of the touches were very classy. Let's celebrate the fact that's he English and here rather that pick the bones out his game at this point of his development.

1946~~~
He was bright enough, sure ending product was not really there, but it's not like he is winger actually, so he was playing in the foreign position on the left. But he hardly was worse than Sterling, i mean whatever Sterling did, Rashford did as well. Only i think if Rashford will have a chance in the center, as Sterling did, he is more likely to score.
So actually all things being equal, i think it a good move to start him on the left next time. Especially if we England will have like Vardy as a CF or Sturridge, because those two can go wide more often than Kane and open central space for LWF and RWF. And if Rashford will play this LWF switching with Vardy, moving inside to be this fox in the box he is, he can be very dangerous. More dangerous than any other option we have on the left in attack.

1947~~~
If the choice is between starting Sterling or Rashford, it's the latter all day long.

1948~~~
It's a lot easier to look smooth at slow motion. Berbatov looked awesome when "running" but it's a terrible comparison. Kane doesn't use pace at all when dribbling because he doesn't have any. You must compare Rashford with other speedsters. He could work on his balance, but that will come in time. He's no young Giggs, but there aren't any of his mould anymore.

1949~~~
Definitely. I'd play him over Sturridge too if it's a wide role - I don't think Sturridge is disciplined or quick enough anymore to start out wide. His goalthreat should be a first choice sub upfront, or as a right forward as he was today when we need a goal.

1950~~~
He is bit strange technically to describe. Will have some clumsy touches. Some ungainly dribbling attempts in between but then there are occasions where he would pull off a incredible set of moves all together which make you go woah look at that.

Actually a young cristiano Rinaldo was quite similar.

1951~~~

1952~~~
That's insane <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1953~~~
Poor tekkers tbf.

1954~~~
What sets him apart is his composure for me. Just looks at ease at the top level which results in him not needing a lot of time to decide what he wants to do with the ball. His dribbling can, at times, be a bit "hopeful" rather than completely in control, but his touch, awareness, intelligence and positioning are really good for a teenager.

1955~~~
Not a fan of those joga bonito reels but this is fecking great, I would probably tear my meniscus if I tried that.

1956~~~
I'd end up doing the impossible and end up kneeing myself in the balls.

1957~~~
That'll be a sight to behold! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1958~~~
He's still raw and makes some wrong decisions with the ball sometimes. I agree about the hoof and chase part as i've observed it on a few occasions where he basically ran the ball out of the field. He is very skillful though and he'll only get better with age. He also has great vision, with his interplay and little flicks to teammates that usually always come off

1959~~~
Piss poor technique

1960~~~
That's all part of experience though. He's so bloody fast that he feels he can outrun everybody, even if it's just a small space. I actually love that he runs at players and commits them, I don't mind that he might lose it every now and again.

Eventually though he will learn when to take people on, or to recycle the ball to keep possession.

1961~~~
Clearly he's not the end product but last seasonhe was playing under 18's and pushing on to under 21's. He's still growing and filling out. It's qiuite unique that we're talking about him playing for England and featuring in the euros. Naturally he is not the finished article but he's shown good composure. His first touch against wales wasn't good but he overcome that and did well

1962~~~
Technically shite, like.

1963~~~
this has nothing to do with technique though, i mean it helps when you have good technique but i know plenty of skillers that have a pretty poor one. Its just practice and repetition, i guess you can say that about most things in football but what i meant, its much easier to learn skills then to improve your first touch, weak foot etc.

PS: the skill is <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1964~~~
It has everything to do with technique.

1965~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qh1sGfLwUEE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1966~~~
I agree. So much potential with this kid

1967~~~
If this was the YT vid of an 18 year old we were linked to for £30M people would be creaming.

1968~~~
If they practised their touch and weak foot as much as their tricks, they would be just as good. People act like a good first touch is natural, sure some people have a more natural "feel" for the ball, but it all comes with honing that skill like anything else. 

Being 2 footed is purely through practise as well. Nobody is born with that skill, some people just practise more and feel more comfortable.

1969~~~
Yeah, we have excellent young player and hopefully he gets the game time next season.

Those backheel passes are excellent and very effective too.

1970~~~
I am not sure why people call him /even consider him as technically poor !!...

His flicks,turns works most of the time . This guys is a real goal scorer . He can make space for himself , knows when to move  , positioning is already top notch , he got the deft touch that will take you away from defenders , he plays as an experienced pro with his flicks and turns which works majority of the time and he is only 18 !!...

Damn I feel too old

1971~~~
there is of course more than one factor of technical ability, he's got a bit inconsistent first touch at times and the ball isn't just glued to his feet all the time but apart that he's got nice skillset and with all the confidence and pace taking on players it's going well for him, I think the incosistent touch is partly due him to going from U18 to senior football in three months, there is much more running in senior football so it is normal that he feels a bit tired and the ball bounces off him on some occasions, still think he's amazing talent and with proper preseason under his belt he will come to the next season even stronger.. 18 yo, he has all his career ahead of him, fecking huge space for improvement while he already is a great player useful and effective palyer. that's just awesome

1972~~~
I think its tiredness, hes has a very good touch usually. Also Martial also miss controls the ball a bit too but I doubt anyone would say he was technically poor. 
I call it overly harsh criticism tbh, I mean if he is technically poor what the hell is Rooney

1973~~~
Probably because he's a United player or English or both.

I get the feeling a lot of people don't really appreciate the level of talent we have on our hands with Rashford at the club. He's not just another run of the mill  academy talent getting games and doing well. He looks the real deal and best striker in his age group. Top top talent. If Mourinho keeps him in the team then he should have the golden ball sealed for next season as well.

1974~~~
I agree that you can improve your touch and weak foot but my point is that is much easier to learn skills then it is to improve other technical tools.

1975~~~
If he can keep out of any serious injuries I can definitely see him being a 20+goals a season striker. He will get couple of assists with his flicks and holding up play.

1976~~~
Shocking that he came on so late in the game. Looked a threat

1977~~~
Youngest player in the squad has the biggest bollocks of the lot of them.

1978~~~
Bringing him on with 4 minutes left was just stupid.

1979~~~
Might have got something out of the game if he'd come on at 70 minutes.

1980~~~
Shocking that he came on so late

1981~~~
MOTM

1982~~~
Should have started instead of Sterling IMO but certainly should have been on 20 minutes sooner than he was.

1983~~~
He was great the little time he got in this Euro. Giving him 4 mins here is a joke from Roy.

1984~~~
More balls than the lot of them. Only player to beat a man.
Not really an England fan, just makes me more excited about Rashford

1985~~~
Yeah, he was great in that 5 mins or so. It's ridiculous that he only got 5 mins though.

Welcome to the crushing disappointment of playing for England, Marcus.

1986~~~
Deserved to come on at HT, Roy is useless

1987~~~
Another great cameo. In his 5 minutes cameo, he's done more than Kane, Alli, Sturridge, Rooney and Sterling put together. Should have been brought on much earlier.

1988~~~
Rashford MotM.

1989~~~
Poor fella, hopefully Jose won't underestimate him, he's class.

1990~~~
Should stay as far as he can away from this England setup, he'll have all the football coached out of him.

1991~~~
Rashford is more reason Jose should maybe buy that 35yr old striker to help him for one season only

1992~~~
Hodgson a massive cnut bringing him on with 4 mins to go. How has Sterling who has been out of form been starting ahead of him? Kane has also been complete shite.

1993~~~
England had one shot on target in the second half and Rashford still couldn't get on.

1994~~~
Not an England fan but can't believe woy didn't bring him on earlier. He had the bib of at 68 and came on at what 85? Mental, roys a clown..MOTM for me

1995~~~
Five minutes on at the end, and the only bright spark England had. Roy you're a joke of a manager.

1996~~~
Could have had his Owen moment if Roy had any sense.

1997~~~
You don't bring a player on after 85 minutes to change the game. You bring a player on at 85 minutes to see it out. You can't do anything with five minutes to go, it's pointless.

1998~~~
He's fantastic. Really showing his technical mediocrity. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1999~~~
Even 5 minutes he didn't put him in his favored right Wing but left. Roy is a idiot.

2000~~~
Terrifying potential and to think that we got laughed at by the opposition fans when said he should have started ahead of both Sturridge & Sterling.

2001~~~
No injuries!  Happy days.

2002~~~
He's bloody fantastic, showed more bollocks than the entire England squad at 18. I want him on the right wing because when he's one on one with a defender he rips them.

2003~~~
In 5 minutes showed £Sterling how it should be done

2004~~~
He did more in 7 mins then the rest of the team put together did in 90 mins.

Shocking he came on in the 86th minute. This was probably worse than anything LVG ever did.

How on earth did England win every game in the qualification?

2005~~~
Man of the match.

2006~~~
Really tried and clearly understood that his team mates were shit, so opted for the dribble instead of the pass. Showed good understanding of his surroundings.

2007~~~
given 5 minutes, how clueless is Woy.

2008~~~
Normally it would by hard to judge anything from such a short cameo, but the willingness and skill he showed in those 5 minutes is encouraging. He's fearless. Much has been said about Mourinho and youth but I think he will love Rashford. What a player.

2009~~~
So people didn't want him to go to Euro and didn't want him to play much due to pressure getting to him to halt his development or some shit like that.

IF anything, this guy has been showing us the opposite again and again.

Again, showing if you have physical and mental abilities, you will become a star. You don't need any kind of over-protection and shit.

2010~~~
Looked like the ultimate cure for 'zombie tempo' disease discovered by Noodlehair somewhere in 2014/15.

2011~~~
Did he just kill Wayne's career for club and country?
<span style="color: #ffffff">If only...</span>

2012~~~
Was very good tonight played better than sturudge and kane did

2013~~~
It's a shame he didn't play more. It wasn't like your typical youngster where you just wanted to see what he could do; most knew he'd be better than Sterling and, after the first couple of games or so, knew he would've put in better showings than Kane and Alli, too. Sturridge was fine and Vardy didn't really get a shot either, but pundits and the like going on about how Sterling brings something unique to the team with his direct play and dribbling abilities are really underestimating Rashford's ability because he's already more effective than Sterling in those aspects. I mean, he can actually beat a man and finish for starters.

At least he suffered no injuries and will hopefully be raring to go for the season ahead!

2014~~~
Looking forward to hear news of Marcus doing a Messi and retire from international football in few hours <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

Joking aside, I think it's a blessing in disguise that he isn't too emerged in this England international culture yet. The more you buy into the hype, the more you get worse. Unnecessarily pressure and expectation playing under badly selected coach and teammates picked by popularity vote instead of carefully scouted. It's better to Marcus to focus on his career at United for now. He still has a long way to go.

2015~~~
More of the same please. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

This kid is the goods.

2016~~~
Martial-Stiker-Rashford 
Would be deadly. If we get a quick striker or even bring in a right winger and put Martial or Rashford in the middle our attack could be sorted for years to come. 
Shame about Woy hardly picking him, he's missed out on vital revision time so he can watch the ball rebound of Sterling and Kane for weeks.

2017~~~
Oh yes please. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2018~~~
Embarrassed Hodgson and every English player within 5 minutes. If we had Rashford, Vardy and Barkley (aka players who run at the defence) on from the 60th minute or so we would probably have nabbed a goal and maybe won.

2019~~~
Wow, what a player.

Amazing that Roy gave him an entire 4 minutes when he gave dog shit Sterling like 70.  How much is our Marcus worth these days if Sterling went for 50? hahahha, fair play to Liverpool there... amazing business.

2020~~~
You have to give them credit. They are good at selling players for £50 million who immediately turn shit after the transfer.

2021~~~
What a stat

2022~~~
This boy is an exciting young talent. Doesn't seem scared or phased of any occasion. I see him playing a big part in our team next season.

2023~~~
Best in the Europe I'd say.

2024~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

feck off Sterling.

2025~~~
Played brilliantly for the short time he was on.

2026~~~
The way he took responsibility for trying to drag something out of that lifeless display in the last 5 minutes was impressive. He should've been given at least 20 minutes to make an impact, exactly the kind of player the game was crying out for.

2027~~~
No one can do that, if England had the best XI in the world they would still find the place for Rooney.

2028~~~
That last 20 minutes everytime the ball went off a was shouting put Rashford on. Even if he'd have had a stinker at least we fecking tried. No way were we gonna score the way it was going.

2029~~~
I wonder what might have been if he had been given more time this tournament

2030~~~
This guy is class, looking forward to see his progress over the coming seasons.

2031~~~
Fecking hell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2032~~~
#dropsterlinglikethepound

2033~~~
Man of the match for England and I'm not even kidding. 

Sterling starting and him getting 5 minutes. Saying it's ridiculous is an understatement.

2034~~~
I agree, was just about to post the same.

Joking aside he was man of the match and that's just embarrassing that a sub, an 18 year old kid at that, can have more impact in six minutes than his ten team mates did in 93 minutes. 

If the FA have got anything about them they should usher Rashford through a separate door back at Luton airport, he doesn't deserve to be seen with that shower of shite.

2035~~~
This guy will win a ballon d'Or

2036~~~
Hodgeasaurus not bringing him on earlier was <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> worthy. Screaming for that third sub and he uses it on 85 minutes.

So excited to see him. I dont think he should start every game next season but should be used a lot.

2037~~~
Ill be honest, I'm incredibly sceptical when young raw players burst onto the scene and hit the ground running as well as the likes of rashford has done, Too often we see young players deemed the next big thing and fade away into obscurity.

However, this lad has come into the madness that is the england setup and walked away with flying colours in my book.

2038~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2039~~~
How does he favour the right wing? He is right footed and you want him cutting into shoot and he also offers the versatility to take the outside making the left a better suit to him. He has played on the left for the youth teams and when up front he drifts to the left more often. His game on the right for the first team was probably his worse game as well. There is really nothing to suggest he favours the right wing over the left. Sturridge also favours the right wing over the left.

2040~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/diso" width="560"></iframe>

2041~~~
If he'd had half an hour, we'd have scored. Simple as.

2042~~~
Its obvious Roy should've started him. Forget about his age and inexperience. Think Owen 98.

2043~~~
I'm similar with young players but so far the lad has nothing but confirmed the hype around him. I was surprised Hodgson was willing to bring him on in the 72nd minute it was I believe, only to pull him back and bring him on 13 minutes later.

The core difference between him and the likes of Sturridge and Sterling are his long legs. He may not have the technical abilities of the other two, but he has good enough feet. If he does pick up speed, however, his long strides compared to Sterling's/Sturridge's short, quick steps make him much harder to stop. Add to it that he seems much stronger on the ball and you have the reason why he could beat those Iceland defenders.
F*** his age, he is the type of player one needed in a match like this.

2044~~~
I swear he was getting ready to come on around the 75 minute mark. Guess Woy bottled it

2045~~~
I've seen Rashford on the right many times and he still looks really good there. It's only the Liverpool game that made him look bad but it's not because he was on the right it was the terrible instructions Van Gaal gave that made Rashford a second RB to cover Varela's inability to defend.

In moments when he's on the right he is still able to produce. I'm sure he played there at his youth and he is extremely versatile in the front three. He doesn't have much of a weak foot and his low crosses really trouble defenders which will especially help Zlatan. 

Here is how he would play:

Zlatan
Martial Mkhitaryan Rashford

This team might be experimented by Jose which I will very much welcome. That front four has a great blend of youth and experience which will excite and punish on the break. Mkhitaryan will be given an Oscar like role and at his time at Dortmund the past season shows that he's not really a RW but a player that moves across the whole team, it's where he's most effective. This front four would become fantastic I reckon.

2046~~~
The composure of this kid is just something else. Ice in his veins.

2047~~~
needs to quit England before they suck the life out of him like they do to everyone else.

2048~~~
Really didn't expect Rashford to do as well as he did - so hats off to him. Still, it was criminal how long Hodgson waited to put him on - should have came on when Vardy came on. England were going to be knocked out whether it was 2-1 or 3-1 - but he didn't gamble and paid the price.

2049~~~
Excited about this kid. I keep thinking this wont last and he will turn into another young player who had an initial impact and then faded away. However the more I see of him, the more I have faith he will become a mainstay in our team for years. He has such composure, is quick, skillful, has a good eye for goal and he is OURS!!

2050~~~
I loved how he was confident to take the corner after his dribble..

2051~~~
I can't wait for the season to begin mostly to watch this kid play and develop. That's what this sport is all about, whoever else we bring in takes a backseat for me.

2052~~~
He did nothing great. He was OK.
Everyone one else was really really really bad.

edit: Not a criticism. I think he'll be a wonderful player for us. But I dont understand the praise he is getting for the little cameo yesterday. 
Expectations must be really low if that got people excited.

2053~~~
The most positive player I've seen in a long time (for us) all he wants to do is go forward.

2054~~~
he did nothing great but what he did with his 7 minutes makes you think if he would have created or scored a goal had he been on longer. The fact that in his few minutes he went past more players than anyone else makes us wonder about what could have been

2055~~~
Don't know what minute it was but the commentators mentioned that he looked like he was coming on a long time before he did, yeah.

2056~~~
This. Although, I don't expect Rashford to start often. It would be very nice to see how we could produce on the right consistently. With Zlatan's tendency to come short at times and hold up play, that should provide the space in behind for Rashford and Martial. Mkhitaryan is much better in a #10 role, in my opinion, much like Griezmann. However, I think we are far more likely to see Rooney in the #10 and Mkhitaryan out wide for the majority of the season. Unfortunately <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>.

2057~~~
I think Jose's smart enough to realise Rooney isn't good enough for a number #10 role when you need to have quick feet and thinking. He will play at DM, but not like a traditional DM but instead a DM like fabregas that mostly contributes in attack. His defensive work is good enough for that position and if Fabregas can play it he can. Rooney is much better playing from deep and less dictating play but instead spreading the game. Let's remember that the entire team was awful last night and Rooney clearly lost his head on the occasion. He won't be doing that again soon, atleast I hope so.

2058~~~
I was worried that Jose will marginalize him. But every time Rashford steps on the field I find it hard to see why a manager would drop a player like him. He's fast, strong and a good finisher. He seems mentally very strong and never looks afraid to play.

He can play in three different positions up front, has no problem tracking back and once he fills in a bit he'll be challenging for everything in the air. All this at 18 and if he does well all the credit for his development will go to Mourinho. If he doesn't do well, the crowd will cut him slack since he's a local boy. He is as close to being a sure bet as they come.

2059~~~
I think Hodgson made a mistake in not giving him more playing time. Honestly, who was playing well enough to keep him out of the team at least for the last 20-30 minutes - Kane, Vardy, Sterling, Sturridge....?

2060~~~
Every player you mentioned have much more experience and are better players. But when it comes down to mentality they ain't got shite on Rashford and Lingard, and that's the problem with England. So all said and done and i agree with you. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2061~~~
Yes, experience normally counts for a lot, didn't we play some merely decent but experienced players like Park in place of Pogba ? Plus although Kane etc had done brilliantly in the league throughout the season they weren't performing in these games. That's why I say for the last 20-30 minutes. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. But if it ain't working, do something.

2062~~~
He's going to be the future of our club.

Even so I think signing Zlatan for a year or 2 makes all the sense in the world. Too much pressure and mileage on a kid at 18/19 can be too much too soon.

Now he'll get the chance to still get quality minutes, fill into his frame, continue to learn his craft and refine his game.

Exciting times ahead but let's not put too much pressure on too soon.

2063~~~
As i said mate i agree. Rashford gave much more to England in those 5 minutes than everyone else on the pitch did for 90 minutes.

He is special and i hope Mourinho keeps developing him.

2064~~~
Basically he played like Martial, picking up the ball in a left-back position and running a million yards to get into the box to rescue an average team with no ability to link play and build more normal attacks. Sort of hilarious in that way. Martial is the best attacker he's ever played with and so tried to emulate him when he was thrown on and given 5 minutes to rescue England's tournament.

2065~~~
Instead he's a Manc through and through who came through the system and loves the club 

Makes me excited every time I realise it <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

</ul>

Jose Mourinho laid down his vision for Manchester United during a secret trip to England’s pre-European Championship camp.

Sportsmail understands he made sure to see United’s trio in Roy Hodgson’s 23-man squad - captain Wayne Rooney, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>teenage sensation Marcus Rashford</b></span> and central defender Chris Smalling.

The four linked up at St George’s Park before England embarked on an ultimately disappointing campaign, which ended in humiliation against Iceland on Monday night.

The meeting acted as an informal introduction to what Mourinho envisages to achieve in the North West - and how he will go about implementing that.

Rooney was key to the discussions, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>with his new boss keen to indicate he intends to break the shackles and allow United to entertain, something to have gone missing under Louis van Gaal last year.</b></span>

Mourinho stressed to <span style="text-decoration: underline"><b>all three</b></span> they are central to his plans as he starts a job he has coveted for some while.

The 53-year-old also revealed certain names not to worry about being signed as rumours spread across the continent as to who he was looking at.

Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is willing to sanction a mega-money transfer this summer, with the club firmly interested in landing Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, who would cost a British transfer record.

Two of Mino Raiola’s other clients, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, are expected to seal switches, while defender Eric Bailly joined from Villarreal for £30million.

Mourinho wanted some face time with a number of his new players in the build up to the tournament in France and travelled to St George’s Park to meet the three of them.

He has gone on the charm offensive with his new players before pre-season training starts, also relaying messages to David de Gea - although that courtesy has not been extended to everybody used by Van Gaal.

De Gea is now on holiday after Spain were dumped out of Euro 2016 by Italy in the last 16.

It is understood each member of Mourinho’s squad is expected back for when United jet off on their tour of Asia on July 19.

They added another date to their diary on Thursday morning, a fixture against Galatasaray on July 30 after clashes with Borussia Dortmund and Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City.

The Portuguese returned from holiday in the Maldives to begin his reign as manager at Old Trafford this week.

Mourinho will begin to welcome back a selection of the United squad who have not been involved in international competition, with Cameron Borthwick-Jackson one having done work at Carrington this week.

Others are expected back in the coming days, although those who played at Euro 2016 and the Copa America are being afforded time off and are spending that abroad.



Underlined A few GOOD key points if true...

I also just hope he sees Rashfords rise as a reason to give other youth a go too, not just use him as he is now a well known talent.

2067~~~
I apologise if this has already been posted but wow, what a special talent. Really well put together as well, love how the west ham goal caps it off.

2068~~~

2069~~~
Really looking forward to him next season. Seems destined for big things.

2070~~~
This type of football is severely lacking amongst English pro football players, I bet not one English first team player could pull this sort of skill off.

2071~~~
i bet 22 out of 23 can do similar things.

2072~~~
Indeed

2073~~~
You'd like to think so but I actually doubt it, if you watch the youtube channel F2 you'd be surprised at what a pro football player can (or can't) pull off skill wise. This kind of thing is what the kids practise day in day out but once they make it pro it takes the backseat. I reckon the only first team English player that can do it as well as Rashford in this video is Sturridge.

2074~~~
Nah, you're grossly underestimating how good professional footballers are.

2075~~~
well, you are basing your opinion on fake F2 videos, what else can i say.....watched a fair share of training videos on FA and Inside City channel and i saw plenty of awful players do skills, watched player warm-ups live and almost everyone can do something, feck i even saw James Collins who is the biggest lump in the league do some skills in one video. Skills as such are one of the easiest things in football, whats difficult is to implement them into your game so they are useful on the pitch.

2076~~~
almost every professional player can do similar tricks, it's completely different on the pitch where you need to be efficient and score a goal, these tricks are pointless on the pitch and the pressure is on as well to pull off something like this... you'd be surprised by players like Smalling and other "non-technical" players.. again their job is different on the pitch..

2077~~~
^ Yup. The reason these players look so 'non-technical' is due to how difficult it is to play under pressure. The biggest difference at the highest level is obviously the amount of time on the ball and how important your first touch has to be. No time for skill about 80% of the time.

2078~~~
I understand this and personally I don't think I am grossly underestimating the players, I know how good you have to be to become a pro player. I just think there is a big lack of street style football missing from our (England's) game, hence why we have hardly any players in our team that can dribble past a man with swarve and skill like Rashford can.

2079~~~
I only play football with friends and I can easily pull that off.

2080~~~
And you guys are grossly over estimating them. Doing these skills has nothing to do with their general football abilities. I pay close attention to players during warm up etc when I go watch games and I guarantee Rooney or Memphis cant do some of the things Marcus is doing in that video.

2081~~~
i saw a video where scott parker did stuff like this at a FIFA launch (14 i think). Im sure mosst in our squad can

2082~~~
I've seen Memphis do many of them in warm ups, infact Josh Harrop also

2083~~~
I really hope Rashford isn't somehow knocked down the pecking order when next season comes. I honestly think this boy will be amazing for us if used the right way.

I know Mourinho usually plays a 4-2-3-1 but a 4-3-3 with a front 3 of Martial, Zlatan, Rashford would be ridiculously good in my mind. Each player suits that formation and the roles required perfectly. Ibrahimovic as the focal point/target man with his strength and skill, with Martial and Rashford running off either side of him being able to play as strikers but also as inverted wingers with their pace and agility. I really can't think of a better front 3 combination in the league. I just hope it works out how I imagine it and I hope Mourinho plays a 4-3-3.

2084~~~
I havent got proof but I honestly havent seen it. In fact Im always shocked by his lack of control every time I see him warm up.

2085~~~
Exactly, they aren't even particularly difficult tricks and also would have absolutely no use in a game. English players not being able to do some fancy around the world, which I am sure they all can, is not the reason they lose games.

2086~~~
I think only flair players can do this sort of thing and some exceptions. I remember Wayne Rooney having some weird Freestyle Football show many years back and he couldn't do half the things the kids did. Simple keepy uppies are easy enough, but adding elements to it are difficult and requires a lot of practice. But yeah, there should be no link between being able to do that and your performances on the field or rather, the correlation should be fairly minimal.

2087~~~
If he continues to show quality then he will surely play.

2088~~~
How about we play good old 4-4-2, with Rashford up front, Ibra as a target man and second striker, Martial on the left and Mkhitarian on the right? Not sure we have midfielders for it though.

2089~~~
I was going to mention Rooney when I saw so many posts claiming most footballers can do similar skills. Well Rooney cant that's for sure.

As you say, all players can do simple kick ups/keepy uppies but when it comes to more tricky skills demonstrated by Rashford in the video I would guess at well under 50% being capable of similar tricks.

2090~~~
These skills one after the other illustrate how good Rashford's close control is, and it definitely reflects on the pitch.



^ Definitely not easy.

All I'm saying is stuff like this isn't prioritised once a lot of English players turn into a top level pro and it shows on the pitch. I know being able to pull this off doesn't make you a good or bad footy player, but it's excellent practice for close control, dribbling and technique.

2091~~~
I've seen many of our academy kids put up clips doing those kinds of freestyle tricks.It has nothing to do with whether England is producing good footballers.

2092~~~
I see nothing impressive about any of those videos. He even fumbles at it towards the end of the videos on the last page. Literally every single professional player can probably pull off a few keep ups and probably do so in training every other day.

Some of the skills videos you see are quite impressive mind but almost entirely pointless and completely irrelevant anyway to how good you are on the pitch.

2093~~~
He does 2 around the worlds and 2 toe bounces. I have seen Rooney do both of those tricks. I have seen Toronto FC's 3rd choice keeper do both, in fact he also toe bounce controlled a 30+ yard pass. I very much doubt TFC's 3rd choice keeper is better at tricks than 50% of top level footballers.

2094~~~
Tbh a lot of the people who seem to be good at these skills stuff aren't even professional footballers. Doubt any pros actually practice any of this seriously once they reach a serious level

2095~~~
I'm not claiming what he is doing is impressive. I just think many footballers lack the agility to do it and their attributes are best suited to other aspects of the game. Yes TFC's 3rd choice keeper can do it, so can the 1 in 20 people playing at my local 5 a side league. That doesn't mean most professional footballers can do it. If that was the case you would see it more often. I can say with confidence that that most premier league defenders would struggle to do it consistently and smoothly as Rashford does. That's 30% of players out the window just there.

Show me a video of Rooney doing it and I will believe you.

Thank you. Rooney looking awful and struggling to do simple skills as expected. Hardly doing what Rashford showed in the video is he. This just demonstrates Rooney is incapable of such tricks/skills.

They both do a round the world each and Rooney fecks his effort up <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> not the same as Rashford mate.

You wanted an around the world from him and I delivered.

I want him out, don't get me wrong, but to suggest that people who train football on a daily basis at such level and who are not absolutely diabolical with their technique is laughable.

I remember watching our lads' warmup before Leverkusen game away 3 or 4 years ago, most of them can pull that type of shit including such stars as TC23 or Buttner iirc.
