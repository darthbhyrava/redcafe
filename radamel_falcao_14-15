Radamel Falcao García Zárate has been officially confirmed as a United player! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2~~~
First for Moyes

3~~~
Yes!

4~~~
I can finally sleep.

5~~~
What a surreal transfer window this has been. I'm very happy with this signing though.

6~~~
Fantastic! A great end to a very good transfer window.

7~~~
meh

8~~~
Done! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

9~~~
Time for a tug.

10~~~
fecking hell, I can't believe we signed Falcao and Di Maria in 1 week <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

11~~~
I'm too heartbroken to be excited. Day guy <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

12~~~
In with the obligatory, "We needed Vidal more than him" post...

13~~~
This feels so weird.

14~~~
That is just Darron Gibson in a wig.

15~~~
Will watch it tomorrow on MUTV..sleeeeeep

16~~~
Can he complement Rooney or Van Persie? Here's hoping Falcao will actually try and pass to his strike partner.

Nevertheless, he is quality. Looking forward to his performances.

17~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

18~~~
Can he play in a midfield of two ?

19~~~
Well that's pretty awesome <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

20~~~
First page. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

21~~~
Hold me.

22~~~
MUTV say they have the first interview "shortly".

23~~~

Awesome signing.

29~~~
Welcome Falcao.

30~~~
Pure quality.

33~~~
when is the MUTV interview?

34~~~
All hail Woodward!

35~~~
30 goals minimum or feck off

36~~~
Lads we have signed Di Maria and Falcao in ONE transfer window!! two of the best players in the world <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

I'm in a dream right now.....

37~~~
Finally, great player, looks happy (not like in that Monaco pic when he got confirmed for them). 

Also thank God we don't have to rely on the currently completely useless duo of Rooney and RvP that much anymore!

38~~~
How bitter were Carragher, Thompson and Quinn about this deal? I would be embarrassed to be that biased if my job was to be objective about football. 

In terms of the actual signing, you can never enough good players in the squad and we have signed one of the best finishers in football. Fantastic deal.

39~~~
Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, Angel di Maria, Daley Blind and now Falcao... if you'd have said we'd have signed all those at the end of last season I'd have called you crazy. I am buzzing, what a summer we've had!

40~~~
Cracked a huge grin opening this thread <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

41~~~
Louis van Gaal: "When a player of <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/FALCAO" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@<b>Falcao</b></a>'s calibre becomes available it's an opportunity not to be missed."

42~~~
Cant wait to see him and Di Maria link up..... Sextastic.

43~~~

44~~~
It really is absurd to think about <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

45~~~
Bloody international break! Even though we really do need it.

But still, bloody hell!

<a class="externalLink" href="http://abload.de/img/757748b4fb8947a290d0ba3rgq.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Large version for masturbatory purposes</a>.

47~~~
Definitely Darron Gibson in a wig.

48~~~
Imagine how many he'll score in the Championship next season!

49~~~
Yeah, so that quote worries me.

No sentiment of team planning, building a squad, or anything. 

Just 'oh Falcao's decent, lets have him too.'

50~~~
Now all we need to do is find a way of actually passing the ball to our forwards.

Feck off <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

51~~~
Wonder who's going to say that United don't have the fear factor anymore now <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Falcao, Rooney, Van Persie, Di Maria, Mata all world class players.

52~~~
He looks immense in that shirt. Can't remember the last player who looked that good in our kit.

53~~~
Sounds very similar to what Fergie said when we signed Van Persie <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

54~~~
Well worth the wait!

55~~~
Worked with van Persie.

56~~~
I do feel an RvP 2012-13 season coming from the lad. I'm pumped.

57~~~
For one season before it caused more problems than it was worth.

58~~~
Surreal.

59~~~

60~~~
Falcao in. Time to win the Premier League. Laugh all you want now, but if it all clicks into place, we'll be right up there.

61~~~
Only been here 20 minutes and he's already thanking Cantona. He's keen.

62~~~
We might only have him for one season anyway. You should enjoy it.

63~~~
FFS <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

It is too.

64~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

65~~~
In before twitter spastics wrongly complain about him using the term "man u"

66~~~
So how does this loan business works ? What if he ends up with a brilliant season with us and Real Madrid etc wants to sign hime, do we get the first refusal ?

67~~~
Nah, I think we'll be too far behind by the time it does click properly.

68~~~
What problems are these? If we sign Falcao just for the one season and it gets us back in the CL, it'll have been worthwhile.

69~~~
Still discombobulated over this.  

Completely discombobulated.  You know how that is...

70~~~
Never been as buzzing for a United signing as this. Pure class.

71~~~
Its a shame it wasn't the full 4 year contract like Ballague said. It will be hard growing to love him as we could end up with another Tevez situation regardless of how well he does.

72~~~
I am literally crying...

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Zq1ziDEuz4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

73~~~
It never really clicked completely when we signed RvP either and we were still leaking goals left, right and middle but we just had the momentum to always end up scoring one more than the opposition. I mean we were pretty much pulling off 3-2, 4-3 wins out there for most of the season.

74~~~
Neither have I. Oh, except for Di Maria <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

75~~~
Astonishing week - Falcao and Di Maria at United. Woody and the Glazers have certainly delivered for us this summer.

Welcome to Manchester United, Radamel Falcao.

76~~~
Is this what happiness feels like? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

77~~~
We have an option to buy at the end of the loan. So if he turned to shit after his injury we can just say no and he'll be 3rd choice here, if he's still world class we'll obviously buy him and he'll be starting every week. Win-win.

78~~~
For all my reservations about various aspects of the summer...

If Falcao is at his best then we have the best striker in the PL. How can you not be excited about this?

79~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wR7chrW-ziA/T_nT5G0UoAI/AAAAAAAADkM/YHtLr34bhB4/s1600/haters-gonna-hate-freddie-mercury.gif" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wR7chrW-ziA/T_nT5G0UoAI/AAAAAAAADkM/YHtLr34bhB4/s1600/haters-gonna-hate-freddie-mercury.gif"/>

80~~~
It's bloody fantastic! Can't wait to see all our new signings fit and in the lineup against QPR, with hopefully Rafael back too.

81~~~
Di Maria
Falcao
Rooney
Van Persie
Mata
Herrera
Blind
Rojo
Januzaj
de Gea



Now watch us somehow manage to feck up making the top 4.

82~~~
So.....

DDG
Jones
Shaw
Herrera
Di Maria
Mata
Blind
RVP
Rooney
Januzaj 
Falcao

Not bad

83~~~
Let's be honest though, we're still not very well balanced.

84~~~
Poor Rio.....Poor Richard Dunne

85~~~
Yeah, that's true, but the team wasn't getting used to a new manager and system then. And City and Chelsea weren't as good as they are now.

86~~~

87~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/sVl0O5f.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/sVl0O5f.png"/>

88~~~
Yup. No excuses at this point.

89~~~
We will win the league, not much more to say. Going to sleep.

90~~~
Nope, good up top and weak everywhere else. Never forget leg day.

91~~~
Di María and Falcao. If you told me we were going to buy those two a couple of months ago, I'd have asked what's wrong with you.

92~~~
A Rawkite -

<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

I love how much this is hurting them.

93~~~

94~~~
What a bat-shit insane transfer window we've just had. Absolutely mental.

95~~~
We got 89 points and barely tried for the final 4 games right? I think any team getting 89 again will win it.

96~~~
Putting all your sympathy's aside, we've replaced Hernandez and Welbeck with Falcao and James Wilson in our team. You can't be anything but delighted with that.

97~~~
Didn't answer my question, thanks anyway.

98~~~
He talked about Giggs in this interview

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/njIrSTuw2xE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

99~~~
Where was Louis?

100~~~
The big question is; How well has he recovered from his injury?

I think that's why it was only a loan move. If he has indeed fully recovered, we can buy him permanently. Good business IMO.

101~~~
That's Cina right now.

102~~~
Rafael, Rojo, Shaw, and Blind say hi.

103~~~
Does this mean that Falcao is one of LVG's famed 24 hour transfers?

104~~~
we went full madrid up in this bitch. hopefully this summer will remove the depressing vibe surrounding transfer windows were we automatically assume anything good happening is bollocks. onwards and upwards lets salvage this season! proper title challenge hopefully.

105~~~
Ah sorry, on we can buy him while he's still our player until the loan expires I'm pretty sure. Once it expires if we don't buy him, then he's Monaco's player and fair game for everyone.

106~~~
Special on MUTV starting

107~~~

108~~~
Holland...Player award ceremony. Same as Blind

109~~~
He was in Netherlands for the Dutch football awards, same with Blind who won the footballer of the year.

110~~~
Rafael is injury prone. Rojo isn't even cleared yet (will it happen?). Shaw yet to play (will provisionally give you that one though). Blind hasn't proven anything yet? Hello to them too.

111~~~
OH feck YEAH! GET THE feck IN EVERYONE!

112~~~
He is in Holland.

113~~~
He speaks English!

114~~~
Cheers.

115~~~
Rafael is always injured, Shaw is 19 and the other two will need time to adapt to the league. It's definitely a weakness.

116~~~
#Mancaticos

117~~~
More like Gaalacticos

118~~~
We have our own Galactico thing going on - RVP, Falcao, Mata, Di Maria and Rooney. feck this is a real wet muppet's dream.

119~~~
Mourinho must be crying himself to sleep. He would kill to have one of our attackers, let alone all of them.

120~~~
Yeah, it's nuts. It's been a great window but those two take the piss.

I love a good no.9 though so big Radamel takes it for me.

121~~~
Phil Thompson was beside himself tonight on sky HQ, declaring that United have only signed Falcao to stop Arsenal getting him, consequently giving ourselves a simple route to 4th spot. Carragher was no better either, They both looked like they needed a large hug, hopefully the share a cab home and get it over with.

122~~~
Show of intent alright. Big shout out to woody and co for getting this deal done welcome Falcao to United.

123~~~

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

125~~~

126~~~
Costa is doing pretty damn well himself. The bigger jokers are Juventus who keep low balling for strikers. We stole RvP from under their noses, now Falcao, Berbatov told them to feck off and Hernandez moved to Real ahead of them, serves them right for stealing Pogba from us.

127~~~
I think he'll be happy enough with Costa, TBH.

128~~~
The team should now be good enough to earn top four. We have an absolutely ridiculous array of world class attacking talent.

129~~~
We can be very balanced with the right formation, the bigger question is will LVG change his system?

--------De Gea
Rafael-Jones-Rojo-Shaw
---------Blind
-Herrera-------Rooney
Januzaj-Falcao-Di Maria

433, the midfield 3 has a holding midfielder with the other 2 have brilliant work rates both defensively and attacking, can score goals from midfield and have a ton of creativity from Waynes 40 yard passes and Herrera's eye of the needle through balls. Both Herrera and Rooney are quite quick for midfield players.

Up front speaks for itself but what should be pointed out is that Falcao and Di Maria are very hard workers and offer a defensive cover.

Our defense has the right balance of attacking full backs, a ball playing CB and a hard as nails CB

Keeper, well, De Dea is boss!

Dropping 1 player and introducing Mata can change that to a 4231. 

<b>Creative</b>
<b>Defensive</b>
<b>Goals</b>
<b>Pace</b>
<b>Link up play</b>

Its perfect.

130~~~
Haha saw someone on here say it earlier but forget who. Still works perfectly

131~~~

Shades of Fergie <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

133~~~
I highly doubt he is. Top of the league. One striker suits his system better.

134~~~
The Van Gaalacticos <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Deal was obviously done much earlier, judging from this pic

136~~~
what highstreet sports retailers can reprint football kits?

137~~~
We're more balanced then when the summer started really. 1 striker in, 2 out, one #10 out, 1 winger world class winger in, 1 inconsistent but these days shit one out, 1 creative and then 1 defensive midfielder in, 1 left back and 1 center back. Impossible to do it all at once because it was a bit ridiculous with our squad but we have a better balance I think. Just a higher standard of forward in compared to the 2 that left so its more competition for the starters.

138~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

143~~~
Rafael is fit again and a great player both at the back and going forward. Rojo will have his work permit sorted and has all the attributes to succeed in England. Shaw has already played a full season in the Premier League and excelled in it for a player of his age and Blind has just been voted the Eredivisie player of the year. Once again, Hi from them.

144~~~
24 hours ago at this time I thought there was 0% chance of this happening.

I'm... more than stunned this happened, really.

145~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

146~~~
I'm not saying we shouldn't have signed another CB and CM but we have good starters in every position now. Don't say it's a weakness until it's proven to be so.

147~~~
Finally a centre forward of pure quality

148~~~
We have an incredible squad now, all we need to do is stay injury free at the back to build a partnership, DROP 352 and we'll challenge for the title (tiny chance of winning it)

149~~~
I thought I'd be going to bed once this was confirmed but now I'm just sat here reading and rereading the United tweets and looking at the pictures in awe.

150~~~
Thats harsh on RVP. Its on like this is the best centre forward signing since RVN.

151~~~

152~~~
And so much for people telling us we can't sign big players without Champions League football. Two huge players have SACRIFICED Champions League football to come play for us.

153~~~
Rafael is fit for now. Speculation about Rojo. Shaw yes, he will probably be fine. Blind winning that means nothing. It's good but that league is nowhere near EPL level. Time will tell. We are still unbalanced though.

154~~~
The fecking goals this guy scores. If any one of his best goals happened to me on FIFA I'd be like "Shit, well to hell with this..." and just turn off the Playstation.

Only Zlatan rivals him in that sense, at least for players who are active today.

155~~~

"Assistant manager?! Pfft! You've never managed anything in your life. . Look at you, with your bullshit t shirt. F**k you!"

157~~~
I'm doing the exact same thing and I'm wrecked tired!  Also giving out to my Arsenal mates on Facebook, telling them they're wrong about Welbeck and he's quality!

158~~~
He must be joking. RVP and Rooney have both been/are top class.

159~~~
I like that line up. Mata can also play where Rooney is if RVP is injured.

160~~~
Attracting all these players without CL football is proof of how big a club United really is.

161~~~
He's having a fecking laugh with some of those goals.

What have we done.

162~~~
Key word "Attack".

163~~~
Me
Me
Then <a class="username" data-user="90032, @diarm" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90032/">@diarm</a> in the newbs pm'd me. He has it as his FF team name.

164~~~
it's significantly better than it was, and close to balanced.

Blind would be the weak link of the front 6, I'd say that defensive midfielder spot, in a formation with three central midfielders. So a lot will hinge on him.

And unless Rojo is fantastic we could always use a world class CB.

165~~~

166~~~
Mixed emotions for me. Glad we've signed a world class striker, but sad that we've lost Danny '<i>*** guy</i>' Welbeck. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

167~~~
finally done. Fantastic!  what a busy transfer season. much needed influx of talent. can't wait to see everyone healthy and in attendance.

168~~~
Madrid and United set to become besties again, swapping players, buying up talent like lads on the lash in Amsterdam.

169~~~
I actually cried watching this. I think if I were 13 and met Ryan Giggs in his prime or Scholsey, I would have felt the same way. Falcao's a good guy.

170~~~
Yeah and Blind can also play CB so when we are defending we have a proper back five and when we are attacking Blind can move up and be a defensive mid.

171~~~
Is Falcao wearing #9? I want to buy the jersey from the Utd store but I have to customize it as he's not in the squad list yet.

172~~~
I think it's more to do with the wages than how big of a club we are. Who the feck cares though, we have Falcao and Di Maria!!!

173~~~
Except for Rooney at #10 I don't mind that.

174~~~
That team is just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> - Fantasy football shit, if anyone predicted that line-up for this season at the end of last season they would have been laughed at.

There's Januzaj too and Carrick still to come back.

175~~~
Yeah exactly, best buddies. Can we have Di Maria back? Pretty please?

I'm actually astonished you guys landed Falcao and we settled for one of your benchwarmers. I don't believe for a second we weren't in for him aswell.

176~~~
Over all happy with this.
Top class striker.
Still don't understand how Real Madrid missed him.

177~~~
That's just it though. United can attract and pay world-class players with no CL football. It's the combination of financial muscle and reputation that is impressive.

178~~~
Bit disappointed by this tbh. I'm told he can't play in a midfield two <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

179~~~
lol

180~~~
Shortest transfer saga ever.

I come on and see people saying there's a rumour we could get him...but Arsenal & Man City will most likely get him. I refresh the caf 15 minutes later and journos are reporting that we've signed him. Yet the Vidal saga goes on for 2-3 months and nothing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

181~~~

182~~~
We'll give you a Rooney for your Khedira. It's not mint, but it's still good!

183~~~
WTF?




50 goals or feck off!<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

184~~~
I think the manager helps out in this case. I don't think we nab players like Di Maria or Falcao with Moyes. The money is important but playing for the likes of Van Gaal or Sir Alex is part of the draw too I would imagine.

185~~~
When I heard City were in for him yesterday I was terrified. I was relieved when he signed for Monaco instead of Chelsea in 2013. Radamel Falcao is a beast that can destroy any team in the World. It's surreal to have him, crazy 24 hours. We have now a frightening team up front. People can be jealous and play down this transfer all they want. The fact is they are terrified that this is the turning point. We can get Rafa, Herrera, Rojo, Shaw, Blind, Di Maria and Falcao into the team ready for QPR. A fecking storm is coming and QPR are going to feel the wrath. Bring it on<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

186~~~
is there an injury update on Shaw, Rafael, Herrera and RVP?

187~~~
He has beautiful locks. Nqat.

188~~~
Don't ruin the mood.

189~~~
Now i really have to go to sleep. Waking up in 3 hours.... hope this is not only a dream.

190~~~
I love that he's a genuine 2 footed player, can score from 30 yards off both feet by smashing it, curling, chipping..yet he's an absolute predator poacher inside the box. He also dribbles better and runs faster than a lot of people give him credit for. The knee injury may have slowed him down, but we'll see

191~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Feck you Madrid, Arsenal and whoever else wanted to sign him.

192~~~
He's so chuffed about the move so I'm guessing unless something goes horribly wrong in the season he's basically our player for the foreseeable future? Since money is no object I'll happily have that! So this is what it feels like to be a Madrid fan in a transfer window <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

193~~~
Wow. Emotional that is. This is why it's important for footballers to be good role models, because there's kids out there who worship some of the players.

194~~~
It's actually impressive how big of an impact Jorge Mendes has on transfers world wide. It's a good thing Fergie was on good terms with him so long ago, I doubt we would have gotten Di Maria and Falcao if he wasn't to be honest.

195~~~
All are due back after International break. As for RVP he played last week so looks fit but there's been several rumours around that he needs surgery, no idea on what limb.

196~~~
too bad. think we should give Wilson games. He looks ready.

197~~~
His youtube videos and variety of goals would put Totti's to shame.

I hope for his first goal he goes for either cut back inside and nonchalantly caress it into top corner with bad foot or else absolutely f*cking obscene overhead kick.

198~~~
I remember when he was leaving Atletico after only 2 seasons, he went up to the stands after the last game and was with the fans saying his goodbyes. Seems to build a great relationship with every club he's at despite being there for such a short time. Seems like a genuinely good guy compared to some other footballers.

199~~~
Important point.  Maybe Fergie knew what he was doing after all.  

Other than midfield, of course...

200~~~
He said he was on twitter

201~~~
He will this season especially with Welbeck and Hernandez out and if we continue to play 2 up top. RVP might get injured (knocks wood) or rotation will make him get his chance. Not to mention FA Cup games when others get a rest.

202~~~
Please man, many top managers have made comments like this, sounds just like Fergie when we got RVP and even Wenger when Arsenal signed Ozil. You surely know LVG is not a Moyes and he has a plan.

203~~~
According to Metro, he needs surgery on the same injury he sustained during the CL.

204~~~
Nice to see that he is calling us the best club, I've gotten tired of the biggest club rhetoric.

205~~~
Thanks!

206~~~
Welcome!

Great to see some long hair back at Old Trafford.

207~~~

208~~~
#9 looks confirmed

209~~~
That's good. And from what I hear, despite us not being in the CL and having interest from other big clubs, Falcao wanted a move to us.

210~~~
Why is my name on the alert?

211~~~
I sent you a personalised one. Thought you'd like to hear the news.

212~~~
Oh thank god he can speak English.

213~~~
Because you're special.

<span style="color: #ffffff">lol jk everyone's name is.</span>

214~~~
Great first interview.

215~~~
That's lazy.....

216~~~
Young and Cleverley <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

217~~~
Seems like a genuinely nice guy. 

Polar opposite to Costa.

218~~~
I don't think Rooney can play RW as an Inside Forward. He's right footed and has no pace. But then again, it's FM.

219~~~
He looks like some kind of ancient warrior. Feel like he is meant to be heading into battle at Troy alongside Achilles rather than in Manchester. Must be the long hair.

220~~~
Forgot its just a loan.

221~~~
You can tell by his facial expression's he's genuinely delighted to be a Manchester United player, I'm guessing Real Madrid (1st) and Manchester United (2nd) were always his dreams, but if this was the case why did he take a move to Monaco? It could have stood in the way of ever joining those clubs and effectively ruined his career so to speak.

222~~~
comes across as a really decent, humble and likable fellow.

Welcome to the Greatest Football Club on earth.

223~~~
I've just been wandering around with a dumb grin the entire day.

224~~~
That smile.  Stubby

225~~~
Money of course. But then he quickly realized there are more important things in your career.

226~~~
Better than I expected!

227~~~
I remember reading that he really had no say in going to Monaco, and the entire deal was orchestrated by his agent. Hopefully this won't spell out trouble for us in the future, if we decide to sign him on a permanent basis.

228~~~
Loan to permanent.

He is ours for the rest of his playing days.

229~~~
I'm pretty sure the power is only with us when it comes to making it permanent.

That's how these post-FFP loan deals seem to work.

230~~~
What a humble human being! I fecking love you Falcao!

231~~~
Id play Januzaj there but I had to be realistic and face the fact Rooney will play. Anywhere you put him just ruins everything.

232~~~
I know some people are greedy but I'm beginning to think its down to the agents. I never understood players like Yaya, Aguero, Eto & Falcao going to unknown teams for extra money when playing at the top level at any top club in Europe will boost your bank account to more than you could ever spend in a life time.

233~~~
Former Journalism student has that English marked down pretty damn good for someone who's never been to England. Well done lad. Seems like a genuine bloke.

234~~~
Agents are probably manipulative cnuts when it comes to transfer business, and will push for whatever move makes them the most money, yes.

235~~~
Loved the bit when he said that hopefully they can teach him better English. Not some snide remark about speaking Spanish all the time. Though LVG would have none of it.

236~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Ive done a bit more than that. I got my own little work out done in my house from just jumping up and down.

237~~~
I was one of the first people to start jizzing over the possibility of Falcao coming here last night, when there was nothing but a few squabbling rumours! Wow what a difference 24 hours makes, we now have Radamel fecking Falcao in our squad!!

I guess we will 99.9% make this transfer permanent sometime over the season assuming nothing goes horribly wrong. Hopefully his goals will fire us back into the CL and maybe even title no21 if we can quickly make up lost ground.

I dunno why we haven't paid Monaco the £40million fee yet, I'm assuming that's down to them rather than us. I'm sure as soon as he's banging in the goals, we will sign him to a 4/5 year contract by activating that clause. Can't believe we've pretty much spent £200million on players this summer <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

238~~~
The method of the madness signing another stiker, this signing that actually makes sense. You pick the bones of our strikers, welbeck sold, Hernandez on loan, RVP may need surgery, and rooney is not in great form. Falcao could be a great signing has despite him being the same age has rooney, he offers something we do not have, a more direct pace from our strikers inside the box, and on an individual level he seems to be in his prime, which I do not think rooney and RVP are in.

239~~~
I would just sell him off and get a good RW if I were you. You can get 2 good players for his wages.

240~~~
His soft voice does not match with his looks. Love it!

241~~~
I don't want to seem over the top or anything, but I think it's safe to say he's the nicest person in the world.

242~~~
I wasn't messing around when I said we were the Gaalacticos.

243~~~
Pretty amazing when you think that he, and many others who've never set foot in a English speaking country can speak better English than Wayne Rooney.

244~~~
Rooney behind Falcao, Mata wide right.

In FM Mata is fantastic on the right wing, in real life? Probably a lot better than last season with this level or quality around him.

245~~~
Chica out (one of the nicest people in the world) and Falcao in (One of the nicest people in the world)

At least we now have a balance.

246~~~
Excellent interview. fecking internationals, can't wait for the QPR game <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

247~~~
I also liked how he really was thinking through his answers and was taking his time to get it right.

248~~~
So that's it for Monaco then, has their sugar daddy pulled out?

249~~~
What a difference a year makes.  Di Maria and Falcao in the space of a week <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

250~~~
Yeah a lot of posts saying he is similar to Rooney and RVP, but he is even more of an out and out striker than them from what I know. His movement is top notch and he's certainly no slouch (at least he wasn't before his injury), he should make plenty of good runs off the last defender which is something we've lacked and something Di Maria, Herrera, and Rooney should thrive off. He's just a goalscoring machine basically.

251~~~
He's lost about 3 billion through divorce. Probably trying to get some of it back

252~~~
Great interview, seems very excited to be here.

Oh and btw, David Moyes several months after being United manager:
"THEY keep telling me this and that, THEY have a great history, blah blah"

Radamel Falcao 3 hours after signing for United:
"WE have top players and the season will be great for US" <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

Enough said.

Good night Falcao and all!
Need to wake up in 2 hours <img alt=":boring:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/boring.gif" title="Boring    :boring:"/>

253~~~
We should get #Gaalacticos trending on twitter.

254~~~
Sorry can't give you Di Maria at the moment but you can have your pick of TC23, Antonio SMASH, Pass it back Ash and Ando Nando. Truly exotic range of players and it's just fair that we get to pick from Modric, Isco, Bale and Ronaldo from your team. Couldn't offer you a fairer deal and oh btw your marketing team will have its job cut out with TC23, a genuine marketing phenomenon. You could probably make a movie out of him and break box-office records.

255~~~
I wasn't even going to buy Fifa 15, but it'd be pretty wrong not to now, with Falcao, ffs.

256~~~

257~~~
I am just hoping to god his injury does not mean he is a shadow of the player he once was. I would play di maria in the number 10 position in-behind rooney and falcao, or just use di maria rooney and falcao in a front 3, and let them interchange. I think mata and RVP may miss out here, we will need mobile players and I defiantly think a combination of blind herrera di maria rooney and falcao fit the 352 system like a glove, which was the problem when RVP and mata played here

258~~~
Started venturing into Spanish video territory on Youtube and found one. He was pretty good in his River Plate days. Another player our scouts missed. 
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MhhIDZTX7X0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

259~~~
Still can't believe we signed this guy. Would never have expected us to sign a striker this window at all. Hopefully he hits the ground running and forms a great partnership with our other attacking talent.

260~~~
Nice of him to thank Woody in his interview. Using Woodys self given nickname of GOD.

261~~~
Weezus

262~~~
I didnt know he spoke english..it will be good for him to settle in

263~~~
It was more to do with work permits. That is why you don't see many non-international south Americans in United Kingdom. Portugal allow it, so Porto/Atletico buy cheap players and sell high.

264~~~
He was on our radar while at River Plate.  <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/falcao.209617/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/falcao.209617/</a>

Clubs like Porto always seem to be the ones to be willing to take risks on these sorts of talents though, it's basically their business model. Then the bigger clubs come in later if it works.

265~~~
hopefully this could turn out the same way as signing RVP in 2012.

not the signing(position wise) that we needed the most but could end up playing a huge role in getting us winning something. especially if RVP truly needs a surgery.

266~~~
Welcome to Man United. Best Number (9) in the world no doubt.

267~~~
Same here man. With him in our lineup I feel we can outscore anyone in the league. Just give him a sniff of a chance and he ll make the most of it.

268~~~
I saw it reported by some cnut earlier than Woody and Mendes have struck up a legit friendship. Way to go Woodsnuff, he's like the puppet master of European football.

If everyone (bar RVP, given the alleged surgery) was fit I'd like to see an 11 like this:
-------Dave
Raf Jones Rojo Shaw
-------Blind
---Herrera Angel
Januzaj ----- Rooney
-------Raddy

Tell me that's not balanced and tell me that's not fearsome. Rooney on the left is a comedown but given he's captain he'll be shoehorned in somewhere, and if it's on the left then Shaw will be losing that chub within days overlapping that div.

EDIT: I've barred RVP, and there's still Carrick and Mata to consider, solid rotation options. I'm going bed.

269~~~
Wait until January, when Rooney can be swapped with Ronaldo.

270~~~
I just shit myself.

271~~~
And we'll swap Fletcher/Carrick for Carvalho/Strootman.

Mendes is probably one of if not the most powerful agent in football at the moment, it's a plus for there to be good relations between us and him.

SAF's Bebe masterplan finally coming to fruition...

272~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Throw in a fake Nicolas Cage and we've got a deal.

273~~~
Haven't kept up with the whole saga but see some people are talking about 350k wages? Any truth to that?

274~~~
Not having that Raddy thing as nickname. Not having that at all.

275~~~
Finally I'll play as Man Utd on FIFA.

276~~~
I agree. Temp ban perhaps?

277~~~
Just remembered that Martin O'Neill turned him down in favour of Heskey.

Hahahaha what a dick.

278~~~
Fcuk off I'm howling. Raddy is easy typing. In hindsight I know a guy with Raddy as a nickname and he's a little bastard so I take it back. Falcao is badass.

279~~~
Deal, so long as the merchandise bought doesn't come wrapped in pink or in an absurd dragon costume. It's not Chinese new year ffs <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

281~~~
Apparently Woody is now on personal level talking terms and regular contact with Mendes.

282~~~
A more pertinent question: How pacy is he? Is he Walcott quick, Welbeck quick, Van Persie quick or Crouch quick?

283~~~
Faster then Van Persie.. More like Van Persie from 4 years ago. Not blistering pace but not slow by any means, he's agile and has quick feet though so it makes a difference, compared to looking like an older and more lumbering striker on the ball.

284~~~
opposition fans are bricking it on social media. 

They're laughing at the transfer, but you can tell they're worried.

285~~~
(Since it's supposed to be licensed by an actual scouting firm now) FM says 14 acceleration and 13 top speed. For comparison, RVP has 13/14, Rooney 16/15, though I don't think we've seen Rooney that fast for a good few years now.

286~~~
That reporter needs to be shot. Welcome. To. Manchester.

He acted like he's retarded (no offense to anyone)

287~~~
SAF's a genius. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

288~~~
feck me, still can't believe it.

289~~~
Thank you agent Neville.

290~~~
El Tigre at Old Trafford... who would have guessed that one.

Amazing signing. For me, better striker than RvP and Rooney. 

I'm really really confused on how LvG will play them 3 together though. is he going to sacrifice Mata? or plan to rotate? 

Time to bring him back to his 100% asap.

291~~~
Right, so everyone knows that he was a phenomenal striker at atletico but has he been the same player for monaco or has he genuinely regressed post move and injury?

292~~~
Thanks for that, chaps. I was just worried if it solves the lack of pace problem in our team. I guess it does, to an extent

293~~~
feckING FALCAO IS A RED! 

I refused to believe the rumors on saturday but im so happy to see him in a red shirt! I was thinking the other day that we need to get a RvP/Rooney replacement and boy we have one of the very best. I hope his knee has fully recovered and he'll do really well for us.

294~~~
He hasn't been that great at Monaco (11 goals in 20 ap., i.e. about as prolific as Berbatov there) and no one knows whether he could play as well as he did at Atletico. He's a bit like RvP and Rooney: a big big name but hasn't performerd at world class level for a year now. He'll be sensational if he manages to regain his form from Atletico though. At his best he is a better striker than both RvP and Rooney.

295~~~
Has the buy option been confirmed? I've heard figures like 50 million euros thrown around way earlier in the day. I sure hope we don't spend 50 million on a 29 year old striker at the end of the year.

296~~~
Many people saw it, we lacked speed in our top 3.

But van Gaal already had van Persie, Mata, Rooney, Hernandez, Welbeck.

What does he do?

The ruthless thing it takes to solve the issue, sign Falcao.

Haters go on and hate.

GAALACTICOS

297~~~
Falcao doesn't add speed. He's marginally quicker than RvP and not even close to Welbeck and Hernandez pace wise.

298~~~
Welbeck and Hernandez lacked the top level quality we wanted.

Wilson as a fourth striker makes more sense to me than keeping either of the others and hindering their careers, they should be playing regularly and they've both already sacrifice.sitting on the bench for too long.

I recall him being fast, maybe I'm wrong.

299~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> He's been quick whenever I've watched him play. 

He may not be as fast as Hernandez or Welbeck but he has better control of the ball than both of them, better first touch, plus more power and finishing.

300~~~
Tbf, he did seem a bit disenchanted with life in France and never looked settled. He probably went there for tax-free hard cash and must have regretted it instantly. I mean come on, Monaco had the second worst attendance record in the leak and struggled to fill their 18000 capacity stadium with an average of 9000 attending. Kind of similar to Cavani's jaded performances but due to different reasons with Cavani unhappy with his position. It has to be noted that he wasn't too impressive before the injury itself. He has started this season off impressively with 2 goals in 3 games as well. 

He is not the slowest player but he isn't the fastest as well. He is fairly quick off the mark and is more explosive(not pace wise but more of Drogba's style wise) than RVP and Rooney. I am pretty sure LVG brought him to increase the fear factor and unpredictability of our forward line. Lately the trio of Mata, RVP and Rooney look rather stale and predictable. Falcao would freshen that up with his insane quality and explosiveness. He is also not a limited poacher as some make him out to be and has a decent all-round game.

301~~~
I think this entire thing is going to backfire. I hope it doesn't, but I think it will. He's a quality player but to be honest I don't really see the point.

302~~~
Maybe you can share your views on how it will backfire and we can discuss further.

303~~~
We have a 31 year old injury prone striker. He appears to be on a rapid decline and has looked slow and static. We have Rooney who turns 29 in a month and also looks on the decline. Has shown no pace and continually slows down our attacking play. Also these two haven't been able to form a functioning partnership yet we insist on playing them together. Also, arguably a reason why they have looked poor is because we aren't creating enough chances.

Then we add a 28 (going on 29 soonish) Falcao. Coming back off an ACL injury, and hasn't looked like reaching his pre-injury form. He isn't overly quick, he will finish off chances however (but, we don't create chances). We look miles off Chelsea, City, and Liverpool. We don't look like beating Arsenal either. If we don't make top four this season or next then we have three aging players, all on HUGE money, and we sold our best young forward to a direct rival.

304~~~
What a signing! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> El Tigre is Rojo

305~~~
I was unable to post my feelings until now because I was busy wanking myself off senseless to the headlines as they broke. So I am happy to say the least.

306~~~
El Tigre at Manchester United! Not the fastest but that can deceive you. Very agile and very 2 footed.

307~~~
Didn't think he spoke a word of English but when I found out he was a journalism student I figured he might. Just saw his first interview and it was in English.

308~~~
So has his wages been confirmed anywhere?

309~~~
In multiple places, the trouble is that everyone is reporting something different.

310~~~
This is bullshit to be honest and i've seen a lot of people say this. He's played three games for Monaco this season and has scored 2 goals <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

311~~~
Don't think it'll be possible for him to go from Athletico Madrid straight to Real actually, Monaco was always a stepping stone for him and his agents to get a big payout for him before actually making the move for his career.

312~~~
Yeah, I've seen both 346k and 180k and would like to know which is closest to the truth.

313~~~
What are you on about? He scored 3 goals in 4 since coming back. He's only been back since the start of the world cup.

314~~~
Hernandez isn't as quick as he started here. Plus his first touch let's him down a few times, which allows defenders to catch up.

315~~~
At worst, Rooney/Falcao have 2-3 seasons left. And Van Persie has 1-2 seasons left. Performing at their current level.

Meaning that we will have at least 4-5 more transfer windows to fix our team's deficiencies before having to replace our frontline.

Sounds good to me. Surely we can sign 2 good midfielders, 1 top CB and RB by then?

316~~~
Odgen changed his article to 265k. That 346k was a wild guess from the cnut. 



Click on the link and he's changed it now.

317~~~
Yep. Plus Herrera, Rojo and Blind sacrificed it too. 5 out of 6 CL players. Excellent. They all seem so eager to join us over anyone else. Love it!

318~~~
He is so beautiful, on par with DOTA.

319~~~
Alright then. I said that because I had read it in a few places. But still, it is a small sample size in a weak league. There are no guarantees that he will return to his pre-injury form.

320~~~
That is why we made it a loan with an option to buy. El Tigre has looked as fit as ever since he had a lot of time to recover, he wasn't rushed back like many players.

321~~~
Sounds like he thinks this is a long term thing at any rate. Promising the fans goals and titles etc.

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

322~~~
Goal number 7 in that compilation - the way he turns the other players, it's fantastic to see a real powerful number 9 again. Incredible skill near the goal and from a long way out, too.

323~~~
Which is fine but if we don't make top four this year then what was the point in getting him? He goes back to Monaco and we sold a good young player for no reason. Or we decide to do the permanent deal and we have three aging players on big money while we try and get to the CL. It's a big risk I think.

324~~~
Absolutely brilliant first interview. He said "we" in his first interview! He seems so genuinely happy and positive to be here it was quite disarming actually. And such good English!

He's got a real confidence about him hasn't he? Immediately talking about titles (plural) while holding eye contact. I like it a lot.

Watching the interview it really started dawning on me that we've signed Falcao... <i>Falcao.</i> I mean, what the f**k? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

325~~~
In Falcao we're getting the best striker in the world at his peak for 4 years if we make him permanent.

326~~~
If we make it back into the CL this season our revenue for 15/16 will likely be over £500m, we're getting to a point where we can afford to buy a £50m player who is ageing, if he gives us 3 good years, fantastic! Then we can just replace him.

327~~~
I want to see the pics of him, Di Maria and Mata walking out of a local restaurant.

328~~~
He is a year younger than rooney, not really an ideal replacement.

Fixed.

329~~~
Love that interview, he is smiling non stop, looks so happy and seems to be all round incredibly polite and nice.

330~~~
I love how the 'experts', who don't  seem to know Rojo played centre back for Sporting and Blind played holding midfielder at Ajax, say we've not signed what we need. They said the same thing when we signed Van Persie. Guess Falcao is gonna fire us to the title then..? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

331~~~
How come he speaks english good? 

Bastard. Hot wife. Stratospheric salary. Super-skilled. Looks like a great guy to boot.

What am I missing here? Small penis?

332~~~
What a great guy, his English surprises me.

333~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Biggest smile right now.

334~~~
Welcome. Get us those goals, now.

335~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://a.pomf.se/igfgwq.gif" src="http://a.pomf.se/igfgwq.gif"/>

336~~~
Lol

337~~~
Felt like we freed him from Monaco. The whole transfer saga to Monaco was shady to say the least and I doubt he even wanted to be there.

338~~~
lovely interview. seems like a well mannered and polite guy. was a beast at porto and at atletico he was arguably the best no.9 in the world, one of the best if not the best for sure.

hope he can get us back into the CL at the very least. if we can get it going quick enough i would not rule us challenging for the tittle.

339~~~
Welcome to utd Falcao!! Looking forward to seeing him in action!

340~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Glorious signing. 

I remember when he was out injured for th WC, I watched a video of his injury and then I ended it spending an hour or so watching all of his goals, simply because of the nature and quality of those goals. 

"Born to score". Never before has a tag become more suited to a player. We have signed up a hell of a player. 

I can not wait until our next match. feck, Radamel Falcao. I never thought we'd see him on our colours once he left Porto for Atletico. 

Gaalacticos are up and running <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Falcao, Di Maria, Blind, Herrera, Rojo, Shaw. A fantastic window. Once everyone is playing, we'll be rocking.

341~~~

342~~~
Genuine two-footed striker caps off a brilliant transfer window. Well done Woody.

Right let's go and show the rest who are the bosses!<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

343~~~
That gif is hilarious. Wenger's face when Woody got Falcao <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

344~~~
Very excited, seems very well mannered. Just watched some of his goals and he scores such a wide variety. Hopefully once we get a full squad fit we can supply him with chances.

One thing I did find funny in his interview was when he (innocently im sure) said "I admire.......some of the players" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

345~~~
He's a world class striker and comes with a certain degree of guarantee. There's no doubt in my mind now that we'll stroll into the top four.

346~~~
He's said to be very pious

347~~~
He is world class no doubt. But I would not be so sure about his success here, yet. Remember Shevechenko and Chelsea?

348~~~
This season, God is with Falcao, and the Red Devils <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

349~~~
Straight swap for hernandez then!

350~~~
Haven't the rumours been that he has been holding out for Real Madrid all summer?

351~~~
Hmm, wish I shared your confidence. Have you seen us play?

We could have had Pele up front in the last few matches and it wouldn't have made any difference.

352~~~
I am delighted. We need this type of player so much. This type of aggressive south american players (Tevez, Edmundo) often go very well in the PL compared to the more technically gifted primadonnas.

This transfer also brings back memories of Marcelo Salas - a guy I always dreamt of having in my team. So about 15 years later on we finally get our own version of the animal.

353~~~
We will improve, there's too much quality [both management and players] in our team for us not to improve.

354~~~
I know, but this player is different. He comes with a certain hunger that is lacking in both of our top strikers.

355~~~
If that means what I think it means, he'll get along great with Ando.

356~~~
You're judging a team that's new to an entire philosophy of football.
Plus in the games we've played we've had 5 first team players injured/unavailable.

In comparison to the other teams who are pretty much playing at full capability and playing philosophies that they've become accustomed to.

I think we're a lot closer than people are giving us credit for.

357~~~
Awesome!!

358~~~
Legend! Just like this guy

359~~~
I've learnt over the last year not too take anything for granted. Names (of players, managers, and even football clubs) count for nothing, I'll wait and judge on what i see on the pitch.

360~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

361~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> or Anderson might just eat him.

362~~~
Yes, Chile had a world class attack back in those days. Their mentality was also unreal - with Salas being just as happy with assisting as with scoring.

363~~~
Honestly I don't think we got involved till late on. Something must have come up with RVP, and with Welbeck/Chicha both going, LVG decided to pounce.

364~~~
wtf lol

365~~~
what a time to be alive. Di Maria, Falcao, young and Ando in the same team.

366~~~
If the team creates proper chances, Falcao will put them away, Ruud Van Nistlerooy mark II. If LvG continues with that 5 at the back crap, then the strikers will suffer no matter who is chosen.

367~~~
Ah that interview is brilliant. He seems a very humble and intelligent guy. Can't wait to see him play.

368~~~
I think there was a lot of talk that the move to Monaco was engineered by third parties that controlled his player rights and they wanted to cash in with one of the oil clubs. You could clearly tell he was unhappy there. Hopefully now he's in a footballing mecca, he can get back to his Atletico form. If he gets anywhere near his best, he will be a dominant player in the EPL.

369~~~
Still can't believe we signed Radamel Falcao. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

370~~~
Had no doubt that it would have got done ,but man did they go right up to the wire ,considering it was the first transfer out of the traps.

371~~~
No, if he continues with that Valencia/Young crap the whole team will suffer.

372~~~
I really do think this could be another RVP in the making. He will feel like he has got a new lease of life after being at Monaco. He is back in the big leagues now, and will want to finish his career with as many trophies as he can get.

Sure his ACL injury is a worry, but no doubt he has had the best treatment possible. The good thing is those type of injuries don't usually take away pace, so that's not much to worry about. If he can find his top form here, he will be an absolute weapon.

373~~~
Wov, this looks unreal, welcome Falcao, I'm sure you'll bang a ton of goals for us. 
Interview was great, he looks and sounds like such a nice guy.

374~~~
Watching the last 4 games, it's our lack of creativity going forward that has resulted in the sorry start to the season. If we continue to play 5 at the back, Rafael and Shaw are not going to be provide any creativity either. Switch to 4 at the back and we would not have to suffer watching Valencia and Young. Let Rafael and Shaw do their primary job, which is defend, let the midfielders and strikers create for each other.

375~~~
I`m really pleased that he has decent English. It will surely help him to settle in quickly.

Can't wait for our next game

376~~~
Considering Valencia had most the ball against Burnley and did nothing with it, I'm confident if teams allow Rafael that much time he'd create more than Valencia easily.

377~~~
I ddid not see this transfer coming until I heard from Sky sports yesterday that it might happen. Absolute shocker. I don't really think we needed another striker, but when a player of Falcaos ability becomes available, you should get him, especially if he wants to join us himself. From the interview he seemed like he was happy and he does have immense quality. I wonder if this deal is really just a loan or if it is really a permanent deal behind closed doors intended to give Monaco more breathing room for FFP.

378~~~
why would anyone laugh at us buying Falcao? Only a jelous, scared idiot would

379~~~
When we signed RVP, and again with Di Maria, I was simply thrilled. Genuinely exciting signings

With Falcao I'm strangely nervous. It just doesnt feel real. Its as if he's too good, and the thought of him not being great or getting injured is just scary

Its like buying a new house. If you can afford it then you're excited, but if you really stretch your budget its exciting but scary too 

ps. WOW !

380~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

381~~~
Good! So we only have to apply for one work permit. Phewww

382~~~
Sorry, but get used to seeing a lot of Valencia. Rafael cannot even get onto the pitch let alone play a match. Valencia has played too many games already for my liking, but unless we want to continue to ruin Jones, Valencia will be chosen.

383~~~
This international break after the transfer market closes it's the worst ever. Everybody wants to see their new signings and they have to watch some shite international friendlies that nobody cares about instead.

384~~~
Falcao cried during farewell session with Alectico Madrid.

385~~~
Aww, he wants to thank God, what a nice chap.

386~~~
I would have loved him here, we were so close as well.

387~~~
Is it weird that seeing him speak English and smiling like a goof in that interview has actually made this transfer more palatable to me? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

388~~~
Jesus you are like an awestruck teenager 

He has played for Monaco and Athletico Madrid and you feel like he is too good for Utd?

Bah

389~~~
Seems the reason he's so happy is because we've rescued him from a footballing nightmare. 

He sounds absolutely ecstatic that he's joined a proper club. 

Excited to see what he can do.

390~~~
dude, you have no idea what a great signing Falcao is, i saw him in river plate (saw him? enjoyed him!), he never gives up, he is the kind of player that scores in the first minute or in the 94th minute, and in all the minutes in between, he is always poaching

is the target man we need for di maria

ok, gotta go wank, then i'll come back <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

391~~~
He is going to tear this league apart. I can't wait 2 weeks for our next game!!!!

392~~~
There are friendlies but there are also Euro qualifiers. Secondly, these two weeks gives our injured players the time to get fit, so probably a good thing for us

393~~~
Oh, don't get me wrong. He's a brilliant player. But then again, maybe I'm just a sappy guy who's still sad to see Welbeck go.

You could actually be describing Boca's Carlos Tevez, in that post of yours. And he did brilliantly for us, the cnut. <a class="username" data-user="72924, @Lay" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/72924/">@Lay</a> mentioned Marcelo Salas. Ah, the memories of being a teenaged transfer muppet. I must have signed that guy for United for three consecutive Championship Manager saves.

394~~~
Why should he have to pay tax when he obviously has residency status in Monaco for this tax year. It doesn't matter where he earns his money he qualifies for their tax laws.

395~~~
marcelo salas, i loved that guy, he played for river plate too, he was the first chilean ever to be considered a football hero in argentina

396~~~
Don't worry, it doesn't stretch our budget too far I'd imagine <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

397~~~
What great news to wake up to in two successive days: yesterday was finding out we had done the loan deal, and the next day I wake up to find the medical was finally passed and he's holding the #shirt ! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Bring on QPR where we can play with all of our shiny new toys at once.

398~~~
I'm fairly sure our team was assembled by a kid on FIFA...

399~~~
Van Gaal is a lot more of a transfer Muppet than I was expecting.

400~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The funny thing is, our squad now doesn't look too different to how I'd imagine my typical FIFA career squad to look like - full of marquee attacking talents with a lack of balance.

401~~~
He will, since he is officially a first team player.

402~~~
Wow! So soft spoken for a big man who call The Tiger!

Had a big grin on him from start to finish and the fact that he did the interview in English is bloody great as well! Love him already!

403~~~
It's probably how Ed did those transfers.

404~~~
So, barring any serious injury, what are we predicting him to get? Without CL or Carling Cup, I reckon he will hit around the 20 mark, which is a conservative guess. It's hard to predict when our team is in such a shambles right now.

405~~~
Well lets pray that Shaw and Rafa are fit ASAP. Once that happens, there is no place in the starting 11 for Valencia and Young.

406~~~
We have just signed the best no 9 in the world. We have just signed Radamel Falcao- i was listening to Ballbag on SSN yesterday saying everything is inside the area with him- he seen half his goals?- the guy has everything barring blistering pace. Don't expect miracles right away but once this team gels- and it will- the results could be frightening.

407~~~
He really is a player that score from nothing. He is one of the few players in the world that can boast such an outrageous youtube compilation! Scoring bicycle kicks for him is the norm.

408~~~
Am another who was gutted when we didn't manage to get Marcelo Salas. Falcao reminds me of him it's exciting.

409~~~
Brenton Rogers....stick that in your pipe and smoke it.

410~~~
RVP when fit is up there among the best no.9 in this world. Rooney is not bad as a no.9 too. And now we've got falcaoooo!!!!

411~~~
I am exactly that - and for an old man - its great !

We're not great, historically, when it comes to buying a "finished" article. The United way is to buy young potential and nurture into top class players. Maybe RVP changed that (for one season anyway). I dont care who he's played for, he's a top top player, and for him to come to United is fantastic

412~~~
Looking back at our premier league list of number 9's, we've had some cracking players, Falcao though is another planet! 

Falcao!!

413~~~
I don't know why but people think that Falcao is a poacher when he is closer to a Ronaldo without the pace.

414~~~
Evans ahead of Jones?!

415~~~
Falcao is a marvellous signing.

If he settles in as quickly as Diego Costa has for Chelsea, he might tear up the prem.

416~~~
6m lone fee with an option to buy is a no brainer, if he has fully recovered from his injury and can get back to his previous form we have the best No 9 in world football.

Fantastic signing. Welbeck will soon be a distant memory.

417~~~
In a big game, if both were fit, at least you know that Evans has performed on the highest stage. I consider him our best and most experienced cb.

418~~~
Funny how everyone was saying we lacked pace in our strikeforce and that was the key issue. Yet are all rejoicing at blowing so much on a poacher who has zero pace. Fans are just blinded by big names and quickly forget that we haven't even addressed  and sorted our main issue in this transfer window. The midfield is still a joke for a club of this stature. Take out our only semi decent midfielder in Herrera and we have a bunch of clowns and pub footballers to choose from.

419~~~
Instead of talking about us signing one of the best number 9's in the world, the media and everyone else are worried about where he's going to fit in for us <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> I's a fantastic signing and it's got our rivals shitting it.

420~~~
I've put the nonsense in bold.

421~~~
I just feel like repeating the words.. Radamel.Falcao.Garcia... and then shouting 'yaaaaaay yaayay' at regular intervals thinking about this transfer.

422~~~
I feel this is phase one of Van Persie potentially being phased out.

423~~~
Quite possibly the biggest load of shite I've ever seen written on here... And that really is saying something.

424~~~
Its true though. The main rhetoric recently has been pace pace pace. Everyone wanted a striker who has pace and could put defenses on the back foot. Its pretty clear that everyone is just blinded by the bright lights of a star name. If we signed Huntelaar for example who is quite similar to falcao everyone would be like "great another forward with no pace". I just find it laughable how everyone has suddenly forgotten about what they actually wanted in the team just because woodward dangled a shinny new toy in their faces.

425~~~
i dont give a shit what people think of our transfer policy, they change their opinions on a daily basis and you cant get them happy no matter what you do. Last year, everyone said we needed at least 5 to 6 top players, now be buy 6 players and they start critisizing us again. Absolute clueless. Lets keep Danny and Chicha and promote the youngsters that earent good enough yet and end up at 7th plaxe again. United need to buy world class players, their asquad isnt good enough compared to City or Chelseas they said. Always the same thing, fecking moaning cnuts, bashing us no matter what we do. Sick of it.

426~~~
Ah! Was wondering where you negative nancies were? Blowing so much on a poacher? Its £6m for the entire year plus his wages. What did you think when we signed RVP? If it was the same, that blew up in your face because he was instrumental in helping us win the title his first year. And Falcao isn't slow. He certainly isn't slower than RVP. Welbeck had pace and played up front. Did it help? 

We have signed two midfielders this window and our best one isn't back from injury. And who played for us two years ago in midfield when we won the title? Was it Zidane and Makelele? No we had a shit midfield back then as well. We have improved on it this summer along with the shit we had two years. So put aside your pessimism for a bit the enjoy the fact that we have just signed the best #9 in the world. Radamel fecking Falcao! And if you're a wum well then feck off, because I hate wums.

427~~~
Falcao has pace, though. Maybe not electric pace like Ronaldo or Bale, but he's surprisingly quick and strong for his size. He's also one of the best in the world when it comes to movement off the ball, which compensates for a lack of pure speed.

428~~~
You do realise that Falcao actually does have pace right? 
He's an explosive striker who relies on pace and power.

429~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> No he doesn't. Please don't start with the whole "deceptively quick" description fans use for top players who're slow just because they can't accept that a player they rate is slow. Off the ball movement is not the same as being fast. One is useful against defenses who sit and defend deep as Van Persie has demonstrated throughout his career, another is effective at stretching defenses, dragging defenders out of their position, capitalising on counter attacks, beating players and creating your own chances etc.

I remember a similar excitement when Mata was signed. Quality player no doubt about it, but did he address our main issues? No and now fans are starting to doubt whether it was a good decision to sign him.

430~~~
Is buying Suarez phase one of Barca phasing out Messi or Neymar?

431~~~
No.

432~~~

Looks like a proper snail here.

433~~~
Same here then.

434~~~
Why are people saying Falcao isn't quick? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

He's always looked quick whenever I've watched him play.

435~~~
Yeah he is quick. Great burst of pace to get a yard for himself.

436~~~
Because he doesn't have Valencia or Ronaldo quickness. But weirdly enough no one says that Messi, Ibrahimovic or Suarez are slow.

437~~~
Anyone got a link to the interview?

438~~~
I think this is two different scenarios. Messi and Neymar are both comfortable playing in wide positions if need be. I see van Persie and Falcao as proper number 9's.

439~~~

Interesting little article

440~~~
You obviously haven't watched much of Falcao, you are describing quite a big part of his game.

441~~~
Falcao similar to Huntelaar. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> No chance. He's so much more than just a poacher.

442~~~
It makes sense at his age to start to pull back his minutes, with two striker positions in the 352 he'll play plenty.

443~~~
Agree about Neymar but I think Messi is far less effective wide. It might be Suarez wide instead. Anyway, that is not the point. Barcelona was not doing bad on attacking front before Suarez. One can say even before Neymar. What they did though is, "buying a world class player when he was available" and as you are seeing with injuries etc, if club can afford to have 3 big forwards on payroll, then it is great insurance when 1 or 2 are injured. 

That way this scenario is similar. United will not try to fit all 3 in same team and play them out of position. Maybe 2 will play together. This will also give RvP chance to have his surgery. If we return to Europe next year, then this will not be a problem. 

Instead of phasing out, I would say it is additional insurance upfront to cover injuries. A very expensive one though. Had Chicharito and Welbeck been banging goals left-right and center, we would not have gone for him I think even if he was available.

444~~~
That's got to be one of the worst comparisons ever made on here.

445~~~
Valencia is a sprinter now. He cannot run with the ball at all.

446~~~
I have. He contributes very little outside of the box. In before you post youtube clips of him doing something useful outside of the box to justify your point.

447~~~
People need a reality check comparing Falcao to Huntelaar. FFS. 

Don't forget that Falcao played in front a 2000 crowd on average last year in Monaco which affected his performances and that he will be very motivated to play in the PL to get a permanent move. I think he will take the league by a storm.

448~~~
I'd much rather have a striker like Falcao who does all his best work inside the box rather than a striker who does a lot of running around outside the box and as the finishing ability of a bulimic.

449~~~
I know but people only consider a player quick when he can compete with Valencia, Walcott... that's ridiculous. A player like Falcao is far from slow, and his mouvement, his reactivity and his technique are almost perfect.

450~~~
This thread isn't getting anywhere near enough attention. 

Falcao. All the bloody maudlin Welbeck fans ruining the buzz.

451~~~
None of what I highlighted had anything to do with outside the box to be honest.
Fact is he has the ability to beat players with skill and pace by himself and make his own goals, there is no denying that if you have watched him play enough
Pace, Power, Skill and good finishing with both feet and in the air.

452~~~
I always think he is taller than he is. For his height he is so good in the air. Can't wait to see him scoring for fun at United.

453~~~
There was some guy who put Rooney up top and Falaco on the right in a 4-2-3-1. That's how ignorant some are.  Either that firsttouch guy is trolling or he hasnt watched Falcao at all.

454~~~
Welcome Falcao is all I have to say !!
Well chuffed <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

455~~~
If I'd just awoken from a 10 year coma, I could swear we just signed Juan Pablo Angel.

456~~~
Firstouch must be on a WUM here.

Fantastic player we've signed, one of the very best #9s around. Waiting to see how he comes back from injury, but I think he's going to take the Prem by storm.

457~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

458~~~
From what i've seen of him he certainly doesn't appear to be fast. Strong yes but not fast. Mabe someone who regularly watches Monaco/AM can confirm this because i'm hearing quite a few posters on here describing him as a fast striker who beats players regularly. Mabe i've missed something.

459~~~
His goalscoring record really is fantastic. 

I said after the Burnley match that I was looking forward for the International Break just so we can compose ourselves - but now I just want it to end as soon as possible <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Falcao unleashed against QPR.

460~~~
Yeah. I think so too.

461~~~
I don't deny he is a fantastic player but so is Mata yet many on here are starting doubt whether his signing made sense. Please understand my point before you put words in my mouth.

462~~~
QPR, just wait for it...that is all.

463~~~
no, Messi wants the no 9 spot. If he wants it, he gets it. Suarez is a no 9 too, even though he can play on the wing. Neymar is more a winger i agree, but the other two have their best position in the same position.

464~~~
You said he has no pace. He does, he is actually quite fast. Not comparable to Mata in the slightest.

You said you'd watched a lot of Falcao, and then asked for more information from those who have watched him for AM or Monaco. Have you or have you not watched a lot of Falcao? 

His strength isn't his pace, it's his finishing with two feet and head which is one of the very best around. However, that doesn't mean he doesn't have pace. He does, not to the levels of Ronaldo or Bale (or Di Maria), but he's really, really not slow. He'll seem very fast against more Prem defences, as well.

465~~~
I usually think Phil Neville has some brains about hime, but you think he would actually read the papers and make some commone sense decisions about some lineups.

This is the line-up he proposes:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/77317000/jpg/_77317079_formation.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/77317000/jpg/_77317079_formation.jpg</a>

Which clearly does not work. He misses teh clear fact that RvP is injured and that was teh biggest factor for us signing Falcao.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29018901" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29018901</a>

466~~~
I really hope that I'm being worried for nothing, but all these Youtube compilations... they're all from his Atletico days.

However, all these Youtube compilations.. my word, what a bloody player!! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

467~~~
I've "followed" him since River Plate and he is faster than Rooney and his more explosive. But the principal difference with most players is that his first touch is excellent and he can actually run with the ball.
He is small but jump very high, has a great timing.
He is excellent technically and has some skills, but he rarely uses them since he can score from every positions.

468~~~
I wouldn't really say he's fast. But he isn't slow. Sort of like Tevez.
Players don't have to be one or the other.

But his movement is insane anyway and he's ridiculously athletic with a superb touch. I have no doubts at all that this guy will score lots of goals here. He's not just a poacher either.
He's like a (better?) prime Tevez.

469~~~
It`s quite a while since I have seen him play but I always thought of him as the complete number 9. Pace, technical skills, deadly.
Only very few like Lewandowski or Suarez (and maybe RvP in his prime) come close.

However let`s see if he is still on that level.

470~~~
He is not Ronaldo/Bale fast, but he is not slow, the lad can shift. He is quicker than Rooney for instance IMO, pace wise you can't compare him to Mata who runs in treacle.

471~~~
A lot of you are comparing the Falcao from Porto/Athletico with the Falcao at Monaco.

472~~~
He was injured a lot last season at Monaco.
However he already has 2 goals in 3 games for them this season, I think he'll be fine.

473~~~
Nothing really worked very well at Monaco, I think it's a year to scrape off to most who've been there.

He did develop a greater ability in his Atletico years. You see a lot more goals that he created for himself, and a lot more finishing from outside the box. At Porto he was more of an inside-the-box finisher, and bar Jardel the best header of the ball I've seen around here. Watch how he places them near the post every time, unsaveable:

Sublime movement all around, he anticipates plays like no one, the perfect player to complete a well functioning team:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRKVQHaPhVE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

474~~~
Reading some of these comments on here I'm getting an impression that he's the next Andy Carroll.

475~~~
What do you mean?

476~~~
Footballers love to repeat the cliche lines.

It's funny how Di Maria, Falcao and Hernandez all joined "The Biggest Club in the World" this summer. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

477~~~
No wonder why he was sacked.

478~~~
Here's a comp from Monaco last season

479~~~
Well two out of three ain't bad <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

480~~~
We are all in agreement that this is our best formation, right?

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.footballuser.com/formations/2014/09/1094950_Manchester_United.jpg" src="http://www.footballuser.com/formations/2014/09/1094950_Manchester_United.jpg"/>

481~~~
Thanks guys! I hate this international break, I'm ready for some goals!

482~~~
You know we've signed a top player when people are worried he's lost it after scoring 14 in 24 in a season plagued by injury.

483~~~
From the half dozen times i saw him at Monaco, i genuinely felt he had become a far more classic predatory number 9, actually think he took a couple of step backs once he got there. Obviously the injury and the team didn't help, and he's still one of the best goal scorers in the world, but we'll see how he goes. The one thing he'll being is his movement off the ball, incredibly smart player.

Personally i'm hoping he becomes another a shevchenko rather than RVP

484~~~
That's it for me.

485~~~
Amazing signing. Now get a haircut.

486~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZMBD53ZuGc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

I know before his injury. But he's not slow as people think.

487~~~
Ah ok. Not sure I agree, I'm not sure he himself regressed, but overall I thought Monaco didn't play that well last season, and I wonder whether there might have been a psychological factor to it (I don't think he enjoyed his time there). I agree he wasn't as impressive as he was at Atletico for example, but I think this could just give him the boost he needs. 

Don't think he'll become a new Shevchenko, I think he'll thrive in the PL, but of course that remains to be seen. 
Best injured XI <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

488~~~
No fecking way.

489~~~
No way! That should be part of his contract if we sign him. He needs to take care of his hair. Makes him look like a proper cartel boss <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

490~~~
He isn't reliant on pace like a lot of forwards so his injury may not have affected him as much as it could have.

As it is he looks tailor made for PL football with his strength and movement. I think he offers something different as he'll play as an out and out 9 and could open up space behind.

491~~~
Its because he's displaced Manchester United's lord and saviour Danny Welbeck.

492~~~
Absolutely delighted with this signing. We have enough players to create a decent amount of chances, we just need someone clinical who can bury them.

Falcao seems like a perfect fit for that. Hopefully the likes of di maria, mata, januzaj etc... can provide him with the service he needs. Reminiscent of RVN.

493~~~
Regressed may not be the right word, he definitely wasn't as impressive.

This is my take as a rival supporter. If you had got Vidal or someone like Vidal, i'd start getting really worried. I think you're missing that drive through the midfield and movement off the ball, maybe blind and herrara will eventually bring that, but who knows?

You're probably right about Falcao, i'm sure he'll flourish, but i just can't see him starting along Rooney and RVP (who may be out for a while i assume), so i'm not overly concerned yet even though he's undoubtedly a class player.

It's all going to come down to how Rojo, Herrara and blind plays IMO.

494~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  Ridiculous. Blind won Eredivisie & Ajax POTY as a defensive midfielder (who can cover at LB if Rojo has to stay central & Shaw is injured/out of form). We signed Herrera, a central midfielder who can play under pressure and move in tight spaces, while also able to press. We have signed a forward that is now the only forward in the squad (bar Wilson) that is better off the ball - he will stretch defences and make runs, unlike RVP & Rooney who are far too static. He also happens to be the best #9 on the face of the planet. We have also signed Real Madrid's 2nd best player, a world class wide player who had his best season in a 3 man central midfield. I know we could have bought another CB, but this window has been fantastic. Open your eyes.

495~~~
Does anyone know what his goals (and assists?) to game record is if you strip out penalties?

And how this compares to other top strikers around?

496~~~
Hey, two of them are fit!

497~~~
Agree about the movement. Look, i think he's a great player, i'm just not convinced how you lot will go until i see Blind, Herrara etc play.

i've seen you lot produce sweet feck all in the 4 games so far. If your movement, pace and general play doesn't improve through your other signings, Falcao will mean naught in the overall scheme things.

498~~~
Yeah I agree with most of what you say to be honest, there's a huge deal of uncertainty surrounding our fortunes, but I think most of our fans are aware of it. There's just a lot of trust in Van Gaal to get things right. 

I also would've preferred to bring in Vidal, but Falcao is a player I really enjoy watching so I really can't feel too saddened by all this, and Di Maria is one of my favourite players around. It's been a very muppety transfer window, now there's a lot of coaching and choices ahead before everything starts ticking. But I do thing there's some very solid foundations with the personnel at the club now.

499~~~
We are comparing him with the Rickie Lambert of Southampton

500~~~
For how long gooDevil? For how long?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

501~~~
Huntelaar is better out side the box than people give him credit for. Certainly a vital part of Schalke's attack.

Anyway, is there an article out there about how he's recovered from his injury at all? Any side-effects for his pace or agility and that sort of thing?

I know he's scored 2 in 3 but it's France...

502~~~
So, who is our best player now? I'd probably say di Maria, closely followed by Falcao. God almighty.

503~~~
I'm not too worried about the pace argument, he seems to have fantastic balance (something which Danny didn't have unfortunately).

One thing I need to ask, is he classed as injury prone - or has he just been unfortunate?

504~~~
Rickie probably won us 2 points this season already. That's as many points as you lot are on right now.

505~~~
completely fair. If we had signed Di Maria and Falcao, especially Di Maria, i'd be giving it to all of you.

506~~~
It's crazy, isn't it? I can't believe people aren't going insane about this. We then have Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, David De Gea and Juan Mata, who are hardly slouches.

507~~~
Well done Rickie Lambert! Can't wait to see Falcao being an absolute ACL reject flop! Thank God we have him on loan eh.

508~~~
We've genuinely one of the finer squads in world football now. There's still a few tweaks necessary, but I'd fully expect us to now challenge for top three.

509~~~
Well that settles that then, Rickie Lambert is the far superior player.

510~~~
Anyone expecting brilliant build up play from Falcao, running past players etc will be left disappointed. He is however capable of beating a man in the final third purely due to his ability to score off either foot. It leaves defenders unbalanced as they don't know which way to show him. This key attribute is what elevates him above the likes of Rooney/RVP as a goalscorer at his peak.

He's a proper number 9 like a Ruud, does all the ugly stuff.. likes running the channels, short sharp link up play and lethal in the box. Those qualities won't diminish by the injury, its just his ability to beat a man in deeper areas will arguably have declined. In a strong team where his role is just to score goals, he could be lethal.. only worry is we don't have the team to expect him to do just that.. we need him to be like a Suarez and be a talisman - it is questionable whether he will be capable of living up to such an expectation.

511~~~
could possibly be a good idea to read the posts before you comment.

512~~~
No point just having the names, we need to assess them in terms of performances. None of them have been world beaters, their combined might looked distinctly average in our last game.

513~~~
you really have a nasty obsession with Rickie don't you?

Did i once say Falcao was going to be a flop?

514~~~
I just find it amusing that the only people harping on about United signing Falcao in a negative way are Liverpool fans! It is blatantly obvious they are jealous.

United's number 9 - Radamel Falcao
Liverpool's number 9 - Rickie Lambert

I am sorry but it is just laughable! Perhaps you should go on about Falcao's wages (that normally makes Liverpool fans feel better) or the fact that you have got Balotelli for 16m and all that...

515~~~

517~~~
Have you read through my posts though? 

IMO, your season isn't hinging on how Falcao performs or the fact that you've signed him, because realistically, is he really a massive upgrade when you lot can start RVP and Rooney up front? with Mata/Di Maria etc behind him?

It's hinging on how Blind, Herrara and co play, and whether LVG will get over himself and play a system that suits his players.

518~~~
Obviously the proof is in the results, but for me what's been seen so far is a team adapting to a new system, a new manager and missing numerous players - new and existing.

Van Gaal says it'll take a bit of time to bed in and I'm sure it will.

Fans of other top 4 challengers are rightly pleased with where we are now but it isn't the whole story. The system is key and it's a brave man who thinks Van Gaal won't get it right long term given the experience he has and the talent at his disposal.

519~~~
If Falcao gets us 20 goals then I would be very surprised if we don't finish top 4.

Rooney will drop behind for me, especially with Mata injured. RvP and Falcao will be ruthless.

520~~~
Robin has looked less than average since the World Cup quarter final, that may have something to tdo with the willingness to spunk money on Falcao.

521~~~
Damn, Athletico Madrid's chant for him is so catchy. I would appreciate it if anyone can find that video of him celebrating with the fans after his last game. I saw it on youtube a couple of days ago and I can't find it again.

522~~~
He doesn't need it! He looks hot, just like a lot of those South American players do with their long locks.
I loved Crespo when he went to England although he didn't play for us, and this man is even better looking.

523~~~
Agreed with what you said but i'm abit more bullish about LVG than you are, but you're right, time will tell. I get the excitement from you lot, but personally, it's not a signing that hugely phases me yet.

EDIT: As an example, you selling Welbeck to arsenal concerns me.

Don't see how you can play RVP, Falcao and Rooney in the same team.

And aren't there whispers that RVP may be out for a few months?

524~~~
RVP is going for a knee op and will be our for months, falcao came up and woodie jumped on it IMO.

525~~~

529~~~
Rooney can play as the number 10 with Falcao and RvP up top together, effectively Rooney plays where Mata has been playing. It all depends what LvG wants to do with his formation of course but I can see that working rather well.

Whispers yes, although I am not sure we would have let Welbeck and Hernandez both go if we knew RvP was going to be injured for a long time.

530~~~
A picture of Phil Thompson would be funny too or was he spoken to on the phone by Sky?

531~~~
RVP is not the same he was two years ago. With every passing month, he looks like his body is giving up on him. Past injuries are catching up to him and there isn't long left in those legs. I would love for him to prove me wrong but with him in that condition we can't afford to have someone like Welbeck or Hernandez as cover. We need a quality forward and there is no one better than Falcao. Also if we don't promote Wilson and RVP gets injuried, then we have the possibility of moving to a 4-3-3 since we will have only two quality strikers in the squad.

532~~~
No that twat had a video interview as well. Talking out of his arse he was yesterday.

533~~~
Even if RVP is out for months, our strike lacks pace, dribbling, "beat a man" technical ability - Falcao brings none of this. He is a similar player to RVP and Rooney. In my eyes we would have been better off keeping Welbeck, who gives us something different, as well as always giving 110% on the pitch, pressing defenders into making mistakes and winning the ball back.

Our attack was already too big, hence why we played 3-5-2 to accomodate the "big three". Now we have added a fourth superstar who will expect to start every week. We cannot play all of RVP, Rooney, Falcao and Mata into any reasonable formation, let alone giving Januzaj the gametime he deserves (except as WB) and it also pressures Di Maria into a more defensive, deeper role in the team, limiting his effectiveness.
Its a signing which wont help the balance and harmony of our squad.

534~~~
there's just not enough pace or dynamism for me, you'd be sticking Di Maria as a CM and wasting him.. If LVG was going to persist with this 3 at the back, i'd personally start Rooney and Falcao upfront, with blind/carrick and Herrara centrally and just allow Di maria to play behind the strikers and roam.

535~~~
That is brilliant! We need to use that as well!

536~~~
Rooney and RvP have been hardly amazing this season so they won't be a huge miss were they be to coming off the bench instead of starting!

I know Rooney's captain but Vermaelen was Arse's captain too and didn't get a sniff at Arsenal. Also RvP was Holland's captain and LvG was all too happy to take him off if he thought it would be to the benefit of the team.

537~~~
I don't believe we'll continue with this 3-5-2 formation, LVG himself said he likes other formation but didn't have the players to play that way but now I believe we have. Also, I am a lot more confident Falcao will step up for us unlike Danny has, he had his change and he failed to deliver on a regular basis.

538~~~

Here you go, they spoke to him backstage at SSNHQ.  Dipper dipshit that he is.

540~~~
You can see my other posts regarding Welbeck (suffice to say I disagree). I am sure Falcao will score some goals, if thats what you mean by "step up", but if we change formation then it just means ANOTHER of our big name attackers being left out. If we are playing a 4-3-3 then that means Rooney has to play out wide (or in midfield...)? Then we have no room for Mata or RVP (I would assume Di Maria or Januzaj on the other wing)

541~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

542~~~
With many of the lower tier teams in PL parking their bus, pace is not as important in these matches. It is more of being prolific in front of goal which Falcao is one of the best in the world. 

Of course when we talk about top teams play against each other, it will be more of a open game and I know Di maria will be able to bring the ball forward with pace.

543~~~
That's great. I really love the bouncy minor key feel of Spanish/South American chants*. Trouble is the tune. The same old English tunes catch on in English grounds because of familiarity. Needs a few airings in the Blaize first.

* We still need to nick Sos Cagon for something.

544~~~
You are making it sound like a bad thing.. competition for places is healthy, it keeps players on their toes. I'd much rather LVG have the balls to say "right, Robin you are playing shit so you're dropped for Falcao" then keeping him in the team because of his reputation.

545~~~
Not just pace, but balance and movement aswell.. I hope you start rooney, RVP and Falcao and stick Di Maria as a CM. i genuinely do.

546~~~
Against the seven nation army rif.

Or we could just start using "Seven Striker Army"

548~~~
And yet so far he has persisted with players who are not playing well, like Mata and Rooney.

Until now, we haven't had players to replace them with.. if Danny Welbeck was this superstar many are making out don't you think LVG would have replaced Rooney/RVP with him?

551~~~
Same ol' same ol'....I'd rather something new. It always annoys me slightly when we fall back into the old templates for new songs.

can someone fill me in on his injury last season? Obviously it kept him out of the world cup so it must have been quite serious

Called flop in half a season, playing in front of 8k people. Well done you French cnuts.

ACL

566~~~
Have a wash then.

567~~~
I love Falcao, he's a really classy player on the pitch and he seems like a really classy person off the pitch. He's really polite in his twitter. 
I remember him crying when leaving Atletico, saying how much he loved his time there. And boy, was he loved, despite just being there two seasons. Clearly he didn't want to go to Monaco.

568~~~
You need to apply for a scouting job at UTD<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

569~~~
Did anyone see him play this season? How good he was?

570~~~
His tweets have been posted all summer in the twitter thread.

571~~~
Ok i started to worry how good he was in pre-season after cameback because ACL injury is pretty serious. Doesn't Vidic had that and he was never the same after that. Wiki helped on that:
Not worried anymore <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

572~~~
Transfer twitter thread being the key words...

573~~~
Now I"m just awaiting confirmation from the megastore that we've sold 14 million Falcao 9 shirts since the window closed, making his transfer essentially free.

574~~~
Just out of interest, why do we let Liverpool fans post wums in here?

Do you think they rate Balotelli higher than Falcao? A couple of my pool mates are gutted we got him, they kept banging on to me they were getting him as a Suarez replacement...

575~~~
If he wasn't a devout Christian.

576~~~
Time to see some falcao clips. I remember little of him, mostly him scoring goals with ridiculous ease for atletico and pissing on the Europa league.

577~~~
Silly you! You're assuming the money goes to us. It doesn't! It goes straight to Madrid!

<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>

579~~~
Sorry. 

I'm off to masturbate in shame.

580~~~
I am not saying that we needed Falcao.
But people have to realize that we do have players like Di Maria, Mata, Rooney who can bring in dynamism and creativity. Our football is a little flat these days, but that is because of a lot of reasons, it's not that we do not have the players who are capable of playing good football. We have the players, the system has to start working.
Anyway, we don't need Falcao to do all of this for us. He is not here to be our Messi or Ronaldo, he is here to be our RvN. Possibly RvN was better with the holdup play.
The way we are playing currently underplays the abilities of our players.
A front four(of sorts) of Falcao/RvP Di-Maria Rooney and Mata is a very good one. It has all the elements of attack. With the right CMs(even decent ones) and Full Backs(who can cross and who are natural and comfortable in that position), this can be a lethal strike force personnel wise. It is up to LvG to make them work. Given time, it should be easiest job in the world to make these players play decently and score some goals. If LvG does his job well we could manage to come up with a title challenge. I just hope LvG is not over-complicating and over doing this philosophy and rebuild thing.
Kindly note that when I mentioned CMs and Full Backs, I am talking about decent ones who are natural in those positions. We have those players, at least decent ones.

RvP/Falcao Rooney Di-Maria Mata Herrera Blind/Carrick Shaw Rojo Jones Rafael DDG is a much better line up than what we had last year.
LvG has to get us to top 4 with this squad, it will be a big failure on his part if he does not.

Just a quick look at him since his return from injury.

582~~~
"Falcao's full recovery was confirmed in mid July, where he would play regularly in pre-season matches for Monaco after 6 months sidelined. He returned on the field at the<a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Emirates_Cup" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Emirates Cup</a> coming on as a substitute for <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimitar_Berbatov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dimitar Berbatov</a> in the 72nd minute as Monaco drew 2–2 against <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia_CF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Valencia</a>.

Wiki.

583~~~
We need this!  Complete change to the same old English chants! 

How does one go about getting a chant used in OT anyway? Share the idea in a United pub before hand or on the Away train?

584~~~
What are your opinions on him? You've probably seen more of him than most.

585~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

586~~~
I saw him at Porto every game, from then on I probably saw as much as anyone else here...

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/radamel-falcao.395918/page-12#post-16407717">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/radamel-falcao.395918/page-12#post-16407717</a>

What on earth has that got to do with anything?

588~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

589~~~
Everyone knows devout Christians are 22% more likely to score with any shot.

Surprised it isn't implemented as a stat in FM.

590~~~
Hopefully it is just a loan deal so if he under performs we can walk away.

591~~~
That's us fecked then.

592~~~
<img alt=":boring:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/boring.gif" title="Boring    :boring:"/>

593~~~
lol, he hasn't underperformed at any club he's been at (River Plate, Porto, Athletico, Monaco (Injured for 6 Months) ) so I doubt he will under perform at United. He is ours for the next 4/5 years hopefully.

594~~~
I've seen criticisms of him not doing much outside of the box which is probably true. However, he has good touch and strength to hold the ball up and he's lethal in goal scoring positions which is fine with me. We've got plenty of players who are good outside the area in the buildup. 

This could be special if he's recovered from his injury.

Stupid international break, the next game can't come soon enough!

595~~~
With players like di Maria, Rooney, Mata and Januzaj I'm not sure we need him to do much for us outside the box!

596~~~
i watched his interview...i thought he would sound more macho, his voice resembled something entirely  different. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

599~~~
Its not your moment Jim! Don't try and hog all the attention. Its Falcao's day!

600~~~
Make him our main striker and make everybody around work for opportunities for him to score. That is the right way forward.

601~~~
If that's his first game back then he'll be just fine.

602~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> - my reaction when he signed.

603~~~
Yes point at me Kevin <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I accept it without any fuss.

604~~~
Yeah but he's probably the wrong type of devout Christian.

605~~~
He's the ideal striker for us right now, Falcao doesn't need 10 chances to score a goal. You give him 1 good opportunity to shoot and the ball is at the back of the net. Build team around Falcao and watch the goals going inside the net if he regains his Madrid form.

606~~~
He gets my approval. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

607~~~
Nev looks like he just ejaculated

608~~~
I don't get why this gif is so funny.

609~~~
To be honest it's not the actual signing of Falcao that really excites me - it's what it represents, being the fact that it now seems that we can compete with the very best clubs for the very best talent where needed.

I don't want United up be like Real Madrid but I do want to see some ambition in the transfer market as the reality is, you need to be able to buy big to compete long term.

The biggest "signing" this year is Van Gaal in my opinion and I'm most excited about that.

610~~~
Seeing us sign DiMaria and Falcao while being out of the Champions League makes me thing who we could of bought over the last 10 years if we had been willing to splash the cash.
Its just a shame its taken us dropping out of the Top 4 for us to finally splash the kind of cash a club as big and as rich as us should be.

611~~~
Indeed. Our immense spending spree this summer was more down to making up for years of lack of spending. I doubt we'll ever see a summer in which we spend so much money again as hopefully we will adopt a more stable structure of strengthening in a particular area, rather than throughout the whole team as we had to do this summer. That, and replacing world class players with world class players, when they leave or age past their peak. Something that we have also failed to do in years.

612~~~
I really hope he goes about setting the pace from the go. Really excited to see him on the pitch.

613~~~
Just put him in my fantasy team alongside Diego Costa.

614~~~
So do we have a clearer picture yet on whether Falcao IS actually our player like Ballague said (4 year deal but first year is classed as a loan because of FFP) or is it a 'true' one year loan with an option to buy?

615~~~
I think its the second option. Its a loan with an option to buy.

616~~~
Interesting. I fear we could get another Tevez situation and we don't end up buying him.
Its going to be an annoying season in that sense.

617~~~
I think we wanted to play it safe. We wanted to be sure we're getting the Falcao of Atletico Madrid and not just a shadow of his former self. 50m euros is a big transfer fee on a player who's condition is yet to be proven after surgery.

I have no doubts El Tigre will regain his greatest form within a few games.

618~~~
Good thing about this signing is that it will make Rooney and rvp have to work hard to be starters. He's a genuine threat to them unless were making place for all three at once.

619~~~
I think it depends on how he does. Hypothetically speaking if he stays fit and makes an impact like RVP did his first year by scoring 25-30 goals, then I honestly can say we will get him next summer. We showed this summer, money is not an issue for us. We will further build our squad next summer and if he have to pay we will because there aren't many #9's available in the market. RVP will be 32 before next season starts and who knows what condition he will be in.

620~~~
I still can't believe we have Falcao and Di Maria at United! If anyone would of said that end of may I would of told them to go feck themselves. Absolutely amazing. It's a great feeling. Really hope they will gel soon and get back to winning ways.

Not to forget we have Louis Van Gaal to take us there.

621~~~
That post from <a class="username" data-user="65209, @BarneyLFC" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65209/">@BarneyLFC</a> sums up everything about him. How desperate <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

622~~~
Which post?

623~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

624~~~
He comes over really well in that interview and talks like he is confident that the move will be permanent. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

On the pace discussion, he is quick of movement and fast over the first 10 yards which is what is more important in a #9, he wont run the length of the pitch flat out like Di Maria or Ronaldo but he doesn't need to.

Reminds me of this nearly Untied striker a swell.

625~~~
Which was originally;

626~~~
Since we've already got him anyway, question is, why not Real ? They've needed a striker, I'd say he's better than Benzema, it looked like a done dealio to them. Surely it's not FFP that stopped RM so what's up ?

627~~~
Just wish we hadn't sold Welbeck. The only player in our frontline who had something different. With RVP, Rooney and now Falcao, we have two "9.5s" and a pure 9. Welbeck had the tactical intelligence to play anywhere across the final third, we now have no one who can do that. I'm just very surprised that LVG could not see the similarities in Welbeck and Muller. Both are very adaptable, though Muller obviously has shown it on the higher level more.

628~~~
Yep seen that all over Rawk. They really are desperate to make out Falcao is shit. I honestly think that if we signed Messi and Ronaldo, Rawk would make up some kind of scenario where they are shit and add nothing to us.

629~~~
Would have predicted we'd end up with a new striker at the end of the transfer window, even as late as the day before deadline day. Even less predictable we'd get someone like Falcao. Have to be happy with a player like that. It's exciting despite it being a confusing signing. Thankfully others are paid to sort out where all these players will play, I just hope they get it right.

630~~~
Jealousy is a terrible trait. Remember when Liverpool fans thought they would actually sign him this summer <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

631~~~
If anyone is in any doubt how good a signing this is for us, the scousers reactions confirm it.

They are shitting themselves.

ETA: Not just the scousers on here, but RAWK, FB, Twitter etc

632~~~
I wish I saw Barney's post <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

633~~~
Didn't work,  check post #625

634~~~

635~~~
He tweeted a load of Tweets from some French guy who was saying Falcao underperformed in the French League, you know as some twisted scouse 'proof' of Falcao being shit.

636~~~
Have we unsettled the squad even further? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

637~~~
I sort of think Carrick might still be better than Blind with actual talent in front of him in Di Maria and Herrera and maybe the front 3 will look better with Januzaj stretching play out right and a striker attacking from the left (likely Rooney or Falcao) next to a 9, like David Villa used to do or Lukaku does sometimes now. 

But basically, yeah.

638~~~
That's not what Mendes said. According to him United agreed to buy Falcao. Whether that agreement is on paper is a different thing, but if it is, I'd presume you would need to handle some kind of compensation to back out of it. FFP (from Monaco side) was the only reason you didn't buy him outright, I think.

639~~~
Thats quite an ironic thing to say from someone with your username.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

640~~~
Happy birthday for then my good man. Let's hope you have twice the reason to celebrate. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

Wow can't believe I haven't posted in here yet. Welcome to United Radamel. Absolutely buzzing with excitement about this deal.

642~~~
Just proudly bought my first ever Manchester United jersey.

643~~~
Surely not after his form over the past year?

644~~~
How so? Pro players will always be happy to play with better players.

645~~~
Don't think this has been posted yet. Here's Falcao's full first interview

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmA0ftRiHQw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Edit: Nope sorry, was posted earlier.

646~~~
With his name and number on it?

647~~~
fecking hilarious how now that he's at united rival fans are trying to pretend he's "not all that" this guy has been the best out and out striker in world football for years. a move to monaco doesnt diminish that. you can tell their genuinely concerned. the ONLY problem with this transfer is that he's 28, so he's ONLY going to dominate the prem for 3 or so years. 

but yea, lambert and ballotelli are better la.

648~~~
Aw, what a nice guy, smiling all the time and says 'we' already.

649~~~
They got a little pea from a much bigger market than Colombia.

650~~~
Yeah he had a big grin from start to finish!

Another video of the Falcao chant of Atletico fans. Hope our fans take to it too!

651~~~
I didn't even realize that Falcao spoke English.<img alt=":o" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Red Face    :o"/>

652~~~
Ah well, probably the only 'logical' explanation ( because naturally logic doesn't apply when talking about RM ).

653~~~
I didn't know that either, until I checked his twitter. He often posts in English.

654~~~
Better English than Rooney, etc, etc....

655~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/th6l1zgAfMc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

656~~~
Is there really much of a worry about his knee injury? This is different to the Vidal situation as although Falcao suffered a more serious injury, he wasn't rushed back like Vidal so his recovery should be better in the long run. It's also worth noting that he suffered two serious injuries to the same knee before he even moved to Europe and that didn't seem to do him any harm. I don't think this injury will necessary mean he will lose any pace at all.

657~~~
He's not that dependant on pace it seems anyway. It's not like Shevchenko - a player who scored goals by running in behind.

He's a big, strong player who's movement and finishing gets him goals. Hopefully he's fine. Regardless, it's a loan deal so the club can asses him before any permanent deal.

658~~~
Yup, Di Maria long sleeve jersey is next!

659~~~
Awww xxx thanks

660~~~
This is brilliant. Surely the new Viva Ronaldo.

The guys on here that can get the chants going should take note, imagine everyone bouncing to this.

661~~~
Amazing how he can't even hold his smile. The guy is happy as feck.

662~~~
I'm buying Di Maria 7 one this year and Falcao 9 next season if we make it permanent. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

663~~~
Fantastic signing.

664~~~
Definetly a player you would rather have in your team than in City/Chelsea's

If he can reach his Atletico form again defenses will fear us again

665~~~
He was pretty good at Monaco aswell. 11 goals in 19 last season before injury, and he's already managed 2 this season before signing for us.

666~~~
In his interview with MUTV he says he has been waiting for this move for a lot of the year. Do you think there was something lined up for a while or just a translation error?

Also does anyone think we have signed him purely for the year or do you expect us to fork out what would be a large fee on a 29year old (things time next year)? I know a lot will depend on how he performs over the season. Anyway needless to say im excited by the signing but we need to vastly improve our supply to the strikers

667~~~
Where do we rate Falcao's movement compared to other strikers in the league? Not too up to date on him.

668~~~
This will mean Rooney and rvp can't afford to put in the kind of performances we've seen from them so far this season.

669~~~
Yeah i watched him against Bordeaux a couple of weeks ago, he scored a last minute equaliser I think

670~~~
Best positional movement of any striker on Earth.

The lowest anyone could place him is JUST below Costa and Suarez.

671~~~

Last goal for Monaco. Go on youtube to watch it because it's blocked.

672~~~
On the face of it, I just thought it's something we've gone for because he became available recently. But the club made a point of saying when the squad numbers were announced that 5,7 and 9 would be taken by new signings, or something along them lines. Maybe we had already lined him up. I didn't expect us to sign another striker.

Absolutely. If Falcao's fit, you feel he plays. The other two, who were pretty much guaranteed a place before, now need to buck their ideas up. You'd imagine it might be then Rooney, van Persie and Mata battling for just two places in the team.

673~~~
Interesting comment. Almost seems like half the point of signing Falcao, from inside the club, was to lift the mood around the club. The coaching staff see the same confidence issues we do and are struggling to talk the squad out of a rut:

<i>“For me it was always hard work that solved things. But I agree confidence is a problem. It’s not easy at times, especially at Old Trafford where we’ve not performed really for over a year now – funnily enough away from home there’s not been the same problem. We need to get that sorted as quickly as possible.”

One way to increase collective confidence, Giggs says, is to bring in internationals of the calibre of Falcao and Ángel di María.

“When you see players of that ilk coming into the club it’s exciting; whether you’re a player or a coach it gives you a buzz. You want to play with the best players and you certainly want to coach the best. We’ve got very good players at the club now. It’s up to us – and them – to get that reflected in the r</i>esults.”

674~~~
OOOF!

675~~~
It would explain why it seemed like he was a dead cert for Madrid for months now yet it never happened and they went for Hernandez instead (can you really see a muppet club like Madrid passing on Falcao?).

Having said that, didn't Falcao say something on Twitter about him getting his dream move to Madrid a few weeks ago?.

676~~~
i just know that he started following some Real players on instagram a few weeks ago, but on Saturday he wrote dream come true #HalaMadrid on twitter and then deleted it.

677~~~

678~~~
Now we have Mata, Herrera and Falcao as the nicest people in the PL. Shame chicha went, he was the nicest out of all of them.

679~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-uniteds-radamel-falcao-transfer-4152849" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-uniteds-radamel-falcao-transfer-4152849</a>

Not sure what these jounos are on, dammed if we do, dammed if we don't.

What really gets on my nerves though is the part where he says we offloaded Welbeck for £4 million less than Falcao will cost us for the year, this including Falcao's wages for the duration of the loan, conveniently forgetting Welbecks wages for the coming year at Arsenal which must be £100 k at least, which actually means Falaco is costing us £1.2 million less.

Seems alot of the papers are unhappy with us for not taking the moral high ground, and be happy wallowing in mid table until we nurture talented English players through the system, whilst making the odd astute purchase of players that other top clubs have missed, to return us to the top..... could have been a long wait!

680~~~
Just watched his interview, I had no idea he could speak English.

681~~~
How can anyone be against this transfer is just beyond me? I think Falcao and Mata might just be the nicest people in the world.

682~~~
Funny how Di Maria and Falcao are 'panic buys'. If don't sign them, they say we can't attract the best and CL meant we couldn't sign them. Now that we have those big name players, they say they panic buys and paid extraordinary amounts of money. It is a literally catch 22 situation.

Nani in and Di Maria in. Welbeck out and Falcao in. Buttner out, Shaw in. Cleverley out, Blind and Herrera in. We still haven't finished yet this season with the janurary window, we could get Strootman/Vidal if we wanted too. If this is not moving forward and upgrading the team, then I don't know what is!

683~~~
Can't wait to see him play! I hope he's still as good as before his injury. Hate these international breaks.

684~~~
You know something is wrong when there are more people crying about Danny leaving than those who are genuinely excited that one of the best players in the world has joined Manchester United. I just can't get this forum sometimes. We don't spend everyone crying that we're not spending, we actually spend and add 2 world class players together with 4 exciting players to our team and these same people are crying about losing our identity. I just can't even come up with a reason why there's even a single person that is against making this transfer permanent in the other thread.

I can come up with only one reason, maybe they just don't know the kind of level this player is.

I love the way he sort of sets his hair at the later part of that interview. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

685~~~
i think a lot of people were chuffed when they heard we would sign him. But when they heard Danny is leaving, it was like this transfer never happened. They are all absolutely down and talk about identity, but forget that we have a massive challenge in front of us this season. I am absolutely delighted about Falcao, still cant believe we have him. Fantastic really.

686~~~
We're just the team they want kick at the moment for some reason, no matter what we do.

Maybe Arsenal can be the shining example for English football or a while now.

687~~~
Do they know we have Rooney, Smalling, Jones, Shaw, Blackett and potentially Wilson for the England team(we also had Cleverley and Welbeck just a day ago too)? I don't understand how people can say Man utd are going to be a foreign team and are effecting the the England team.

We need a good balance, which we do have!

688~~~
When will be the earliest occasion to see him live? Any friendlies maybe?

689~~~
Next Saturday, 1:30 am against Brazil. I know I'll be watching it. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

690~~~
Great comments, but not surprised to hear this. I can imagine him being quiet but someone who has that aura around them in the dressing room. Our players will have so much respect for him.

691~~~
Anyone else feel like he'll have an RvP type impact? Maybe not taking us to the title, but taking us a long way nonetheless.

692~~~
Nice. It's 3am for me and I'm out for the weekend so I will not, but you can make a summary of his performance. I will be watching you...

693~~~
Surprised to hear him speaking English decently, had no idea that he could. I'm so excited to see him banging goals in, his finishing is absurd

694~~~
---------Falcao-----
------Rooney-------
Mata-----------Dimaria
-----------Herrera------
------Blind--------------
Shaw--------------Raf
-------Rojo---Jones----
-----------Dave--------


A long with the manager theres third place tied up.

695~~~
So Balague was right about that down payment, then?

696~~~
Have to be honest, I used to look at his face and think "what a cnut". That interview has just won me over. He looks like such a nice human being. It really does make a difference to me if our footballers are nice.

697~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

What?

698~~~
feck me. We signed Falcao. This hasn't really sunk in yet. A true galactico signing. I'm not for the whole galactico policy but there's something ever so exciting about this.

He is incredibly clinical and can score from pretty much anywhere, anyhow. If he's fully recovered, he's going to score goals. Sexy ones too.

699~~~
How did he end up at Monaco? Was it solely financial reasons? I remember around the time that Atletico were in a spot of bother with their own finances, but I can't be sure.

700~~~
Still stunned.

701~~~

702~~~
Himself and Di Maria will certainly influence other world class players
To join in the future.

703~~~
Just watched the interview. Seems like a really nice guy.

704~~~
Ah, I see. Mendes is a sneaky so and so. Thanks.

705~~~
I don't quite fecking understand how we got Di Maria and Falcao in the space of a week. Incredible. Can't wait to see us really get going in the coming months.

706~~~
But now there is no third party involved and Monaco hold all his rights, no? Or is it that noone knows apart from Mendes and Co?

707~~~
Hello lads. Thought I'd give my two cents. I posted this in the other thread and since I put some effort into this post, I'd like some of opinion on the matter. Because here is where we have all the reaction best <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Let me assuage some of the worries about Falcao and give some insight into the man.

<b>What is Falcao all about?</b>

Bucket load of goals. Ridiculous consistency. Hard worker. Humble man.

<b>What are his best attributes?</b>

Tremendous finishing capability. Tremendous in the air. Tremendous in movement off the ball. Good at link-up play in counters.

<b>What are his best physical attributes?
</b>
- He's had one major injury and that's the cruciate to his knee. Apart from that he's super fit and not often injured. Built impressively as well.

- He may be a short man but he's got a great spring on him and he is phenomenal at heading.

- He is NOT reliant on pace. In his younger days at Porto and Atletico Madrid, he did use his pace in counters, but 90% of his game is about truly great movement. He's a very intelligent player who has the ability to look at a defence and instantly pick out its weaknesses. Uncanny.

- Has loads of stamina as well.

<b>What about his mentality?
</b>
It's one of his greatest assets. He's got that state of mind the great players like Ronaldo and Messi have. Unflinching in the face of opposition. Even during injury, doctors were said to have been surprised by the steely resolve he had in doing rehabilitation. He's an emotional man who attaches himself deeply with the team he plays for. He was sold to Monaco for £50m and with that money Atletico Madrid were able to build a great team. He didn't ask for the transfer. At United, he will not be affected one bit by all the negativity. The man exudes confidence and brilliance. Full of class - He even went and calmed Soner Ertek, the idiot who did his knee in with a horrible tackle by saying - "
Soner Ertek thanks for your posts . Do not blame yourself for what happened are accidents of football." (bad google translation but you get the point.)

Because of his playing style, which is like Pippo Inzhagi except 10 times better in putting the ball in the back of the net, he can play at the top level for a good 4-5 years. The master of longevity, Ryan Giggs will be able to help him deal with his ageing body as well.

The only concern is his knee. The good thing is he's taken care of by Jorge Mendes. Mendes is a man known for taking great care of his players. He even has a medical wing to his company - Gestifute. If there's anyone who would make sure that his product is not destroyed by faulty rehabilitation, it's Jorge Mendes - He'd have the best of modern technology to help him. Remember he was rehabilitated in the supremely opulent setting of Monaco. Plus, loads of players recover from cruciate knee injuries. Not everyone is an 'Owen Hargreaves'. Look at good ol' Bebe after that nightmare injury at Besiktas. He had phenomenal season at Pacos, full of power and speed. By the way, he's Jorge Mendes's player as well <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

708~~~
I agree; let's sign the panda too. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view3/1836968/panda-dance-o.gif" src="http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view3/1836968/panda-dance-o.gif"/>

709~~~
Religion is not in the same bracket as race, place of birth, skin colour or even food taste. It is chosen by you, not defined by genes.

710~~~
That's interesting about Jorge Mendes. Thanks for the post.

711~~~
Still cant believe this. Still wake up everyday and check to make sure it wasn't just a dream.
I still haven't got over Di Maria tbh. 

Thanks Woody and thankyou Glazers. You have made me as excited as I used to be at Christmas as a child.

712~~~
Cheers.

713~~~
Good post

714~~~
It only happened last night.

715~~~
Would have him as number 1 personally. Alexis runs him close if he's classed as a striker, otherwise Diego Costa is up there.

716~~~
Hahah I know mate.

717~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

718~~~
Just spat my tea out <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

719~~~
He's also a bible basher and anti-drugs campaigner who does a lot of youth work

720~~~
Really looking forward to seeing him play! He's going to be a quality signing i think, just hope he gets the proper service to start scoring quite a few goals!

721~~~
This signing kind of makes you forget we have signed Angel Di Maria and Daley Blind <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> 

Kind of confused and somewhat concerned (In a good way I guess) about who plays. Will Mata survive? Who plays in midfield? Do we drop the 352?
I hate the international break, roll on QPR

722~~~
It's truly remarkable that we managed to pull this off. If we finally start clicking as a team, he'll destroy the league.

723~~~
Will he be taking our penalties ?

724~~~
Probably second in line behind Rooney. Wouldn't want to anger or confuse Wayne.

725~~~
It made very little sense as a signing but I'm still ridiculously excited about this. Stylistically, he reminds me quite a bit of Batistuta. As a pure, natural centre forward, he's the best fit since Ruud Van Nistelrooy imo. As great as Rooney and RVP have been, their games are a bit different. I wonder if there's any chance of RVP reprising his earlier Arsenal role and playing as a second striker alongside Falcao? He's been brilliant for us, even last season I thought, but the nature of his position as an outright No. 9 means he hasn't really utilised his creativity and excellent short range passing for us.

726~~~
He seems happy in the interview. Just wait till he see the crossing machines Valencia and Young 'supplying' him with crosses in training.

727~~~
A section of Monaco's support are demanding refunds on their season tickets due to the sales of Falcao and James. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

728~~~
Wait till he starts linking up with Mata, Di Maria, Herrera, Rooney, RVP & Januzaj <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

729~~~
RVP was quoted today saying that the talk of an operation on him is "nonsense" and has been made up by somebody. So, Falcao wasn't bought because of RVP.
LVG's sure going to have a tough selection job when all 3 of Rooney, RVP and Falcao are fully fit.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://dailyindependentnig.com/2014/09/van-persie-blasts-fantasy-knee-surgery-claims/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://dailyindependentnig.com/2014/09/van-persie-blasts-fantasy-knee-surgery-claims/</a>

730~~~
do we have buy option next year, or something?

731~~~
Lot of conflicting reports. All we really know is that it's a season long loan, as confirmed by the club.

732~~~
I know you're joking, but with any luck Rafa and Shaw will be fit after the international break and we won't have to suffer those two shit all over any hope of a good team performance.

733~~~
Interesting. 

Right now, I'd drop RVP for Falcao. Rooney is the captain after all, even if he hasn't been any better..

734~~~
You know what, he looks like the type of guy that will do it on a cold night in Stoke too.

735~~~
The club confirmed that it's a season long loan "with an option to buy" in the twitter announcement.

736~~~
Nahh, too slow..

737~~~
Ah so you're right, missed that part. Well then, I fully expect us to conclude the deal next summer.

738~~~
Hoping he's still the same before he did his ACL. If he's still in good touch, he could be good to go for another 3-4 years. He doesn't really need to rely on pace to get his goals so losing pace shouldn't be an issue

We really needed this signing now when you think of it, because you can just tell Rooney's going to have one of those seasons where he's dazed and confused most of the time and RVP obviously is not fit. If Falcao can come in and score 20 goals it will release the pressure valve on those 2.

739~~~
I hope Mata survives. He's only really had half a season with us and already 2 different managers.

740~~~
Nah, the wind will hold the ball up nicely for him.

741~~~
Ok this is a old topic but I ask it again anyway. I'm always curious why he never choose a champion league qualified club.
Moved from Porto to A Madrid ( rejected Chelsea) to Monaco ( rejected both Chelsea and RM, maybe atl Madrid didn't want to sell to their rival) to United ( He had Hala Madrid -ed just before he moved here).  Seriously but he's just that unlucky and wasn't up to him to choose because of 3rd party ownership thing or what...

742~~~
Madrid didn't want him. That is the truth. They wanted a player like Hernandez who wouldn't expect to take over from Benzema. Falcao didn't want to play second fiddle and rightly so. Madrid and Mendes couldn't come to an agreement on terms basically.

743~~~
of course he is happy, he never really wanted the move to Monaco. It was always just for a year and then looking to get his move to a big club.

744~~~
My guess is:

<b>Porto to A.Madrid</b> = €50 million transfer (40 with 10 bonuses)  Porto could not turn that down and Falcao was going to La Liga, which is a win. 

<b>A.Madrid to Monaco</b> = I think his agent played the biggest part in this with money being an obvious lure. 

<b>Monaco to United</b> = Realized money isn't everything and needed a way out of that nightmare of a club. No one could afford him at €55 million + his huge wages during these FFP times, bar Madrid who didn't want him, Barcelona who doesn't need him and Bayern who doesn't need him.

Bogota

Tuesday 02 September 2014









In the Colombian city of Santa Marta on the Caribbean coast, a statue towers by the entrance of the Eduardo Santos stadium. Wild coils of yellow hair, arms flailing and eyes fixed on the ball, the 22-foot bronze work portrays one of the country’s most recognizable faces: that of Carlos “El Pibe” Valderrama, the languid genius and heartbeat of Colombia’s golden team of the 1990s.

Considered the greatest player to have worn his country’s yellow jersey, Valderrama brought joy to a nation struggling through the violent years of Colombia’s drug wars. For many Colombians, nobody will ever touch “El Pibe’s” iconic status. But in recent years a new star has started to shine. He is also from Santa Marta.

Born in 1986, Radamel Falcao Garcia Zarate was rooted in football. He was named after the Brazilian who shone as part of the 1982 Selecao, and his father – also called Radamel – was a professional who had played centre-back for Colombian side Santa Fe. By the time Radamel was born, however, his father’s career was on the wane. With Radamel aged just four, the family set up a new life over the Venezuelan border.

For the next five years the young Radamel was whisked around as his dad chased the dying days of his career in a country not known for its football. It was baseball that ruled and so it was inevitable that the youngster would turn to bat and ball. After a painful incident involving a bloody nose playing football, Falcao took up baseball and showed promise. “He was very good,” his father recalls. “His baseball coach once begged me to let him continue playing because he was so quick in getting to the bases.”

But Falcao’s dalliance with baseball soon ended when, in 1995, his family returned to Colombia. Back in Bogota he joined a local side where he would train after school. His eye for goal caught the attention of a friend of his father.

Argentine Silvano Espindola was a devout Christian and had played with Falcao Snr at Colombian side Union Magdalena. Now a businessman and spiritual guide, he channelled his post-playing career energies into a football school with a religious bent; players weren’t just picked for their abilities but for their personal qualities too. It would be the turning point in the youngster’s life.

“That was my dad’s main goal when I was a kid: to turn me into a good man,” Falcao later told Colombian journalist Mauricio Silva. “Everyone who was involved in that school saw their lives totally transformed.”

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article9707471.ece/alternates/w460/pg-60-falcao-2.jpg" src="http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/article9707471.ece/alternates/w460/pg-60-falcao-2.jpg"/> Radamel Falcao (top right) playing for one of the Bogota youth sides aged 11  
It was Espindola who convinced the youngster to turn his back on Bogota’s biggest clubs, Santa Fe and Millonarios, to join his Fair Play academy. At just 13 years old, his big moment had arrived and he joined the squad who were in the Colombian Second Division.

By August 1999 he believed the fledgling star was ready to play. “Silvano and I made the decision a few days before our league game with Pereira,” then Lanceros manager Hernan Pacheco tells me after a football practice with young kids in Bogota. “We’d both seen how good he was, and his ability of doing something completely different stood out.”

On 28 August 1999, with just 20 minutes left in the team’s match, Falcao made history as the youngest player to play in Colombian football. “He was a bit shy and the other players really didn’t like what I did. Imagine having to come off for a 13-year-old child? Both my guys and the opposition told me to stop messing around and treat football professionally,” Pacheco recalls.

Despite the initial hostilities, his team-mates were soon won over. “They were all impressed after that game. We knew he was something special.”

Falcao would go on to become the youngest player to score in the Colombian League before Espindola orchestrated a move to River Plate a year later. It was here that his precocious talent was honed and toughened. “When he went to Argentina he stuck it out despite being left alone a lot of the time. Most Colombians there came home missing their mums but not him,” his father later said.

The teenager worked his way through the youth ranks, and later took a journalism degree at the University of Palermo. He made his debut four years after signing for River, having acquired a nickname due to his style of play. “You played like a tiger today,” team-mate Gonzalo Luduena told him in the changing rooms after an Under-15s game.

In 2005 his career took off with seven goals in as many games, but a cruciate injury ruled him out for a year. Not for the last time Falcao would turn to God and his faith to help him through.

By 2007 he was back to his best and he made his international debut shortly before hard-up River sold him to Porto for $5m (£3m). Over the next three seasons he scored 72 goals in 87 games, then won the 2011 Europa League and was on his way to becoming one of Europe’s best strikers. Now at a major club, the only worry will be to keep him fit. But if Louis van Gaal succeeds, then one day Santa Marta may boast two statues celebrating Colombia’s famous footballing sons.

746~~~
never knew that he had a cruciate injury before. Good article too

747~~~
I can't believe it. 


Alongside Lewandowski, he is the best striker in the world. And now he's a Manchester United player. 

Incredible. 

Absolutely mental.

748~~~
And you know it because? Widely reported many times that Real Madrid were interest and he went as far as tweeting Real Madrid is dream come true or whatever but the deal fell through because of his wage it seem. As crazy as Perez is, he knows Real Madrid can't afford him and Benzema so they went for Chicharito.

749~~~
Yup, I'd agree. Think Alexis' runs come best from out wide though, with the centre backs occupied with the initial threat of the striker.

750~~~
Wow and to think they normally struggle to fill in half of their 18000 capacity stadium....

751~~~
I read it in The Sun.

752~~~
Must be legit. I can't argue with that <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

753~~~
Yeah, that and Benzema might have signalled he'd put in a transfer request if they got Falcao..leaving them in the same place they were.

754~~~
Obviously Madrid wanted him, he wouldnt tweet what he tweeted if the deal wasnt close. So something changed or complicated the transfer. I dont care, he will give 100% for us and that is what counts.

755~~~
Probably a slightly worsened place than before. Despite being a tier below the top, top strikers, Benzema is a player who will show for the ball and is more than willing to move out onto the wings, which benefits the goalscoring wingers in Ronaldo and Bale. Particularly the former, he is given a bit of a free pass on his wide duties due to this. Having a more static (isn't really the right word to describe Falcao) rather, a less willing player to not use his movement for his own benefit in the opposing box, would be detrimental for an already fairly imbalanced Madrid side.

756~~~
Yeah exactly. Not worth the risk

Cannot understand why people would be concerned by his age? Is 28 actually considered old? 

28 is a prime age and has a good few years left. 

Ian Wright was 28 when he joined Arsenal and went on to break their goalscoring record.

A lot of the people who were in this thread will be very happy now. Falcao was utterly sensational that night (Europa League final 2012)

The club confirmed we have an option to buy.

764~~~
You just described exactly why Benzema is so valued there and why they keep renewing his contract. A lot of times he's been said to leave Madrid and each time he's stayed.

765~~~
Nice to see Wilson name checked by RvP.

766~~~

767~~~

768~~~
There is this strange obsession with age these days. As if buying a footballer in his prime is some kind of mistake

769~~~
<3

770~~~
Excatly!  Players don't turn shit when they hit 30. And at 28, a player is in his absolute prime. 

If you were to assemble a superstar track team would you leave Bolt out? He's 28. Adrien Peterson(I know) had a phenomenal year at 28 after an ACL surgery. Zidane was 29 when Madrid bought him for a world record fee. Which he repayed with a CL win. Even Ronaldo is 29 already. 

Did messi cloud everyone's judgement? Not every 24 year old is at any kind of peak.

771~~~
We should be glad that our club has finally dumped the resale value policy and going in for peak age footballers.

772~~~
Yea. Our fanbase suffers from Stockholm syndrome with a  dash of 1992 nostalgia.

773~~~
The issue here is that we already have 2 top strikers, so an experienced superstar wasn't what we necessarily needed in this position.  A peak age world class midfielder or centre back is something I'm sure no-one would have a problem with.

774~~~
True, but the fault in that logic is that Falcao was chosen over a world class midfielder. He wasn't.

775~~~
Odd the way whole swathes of the planet make the same choice as infants. That sort of shite has no place in the football forum.

776~~~
He's not going back to Monaco we will sign him next season, best finisher around. There are a handful of better strikers for me but still a top signing with RVP's inure issues and Rooney blowing hot and cold (still think he will end up having a good season).

777~~~
Never understood the resale value policy. If we're not a selling club why should we care what fees we might get for our players?

We didn't give a damn about resale values when we were signing Dwight Yorke etc. If Ronaldo was genuinely available would we be thinking but he'll be 34 when the contract ends...?

Glad to see United seeing world stars like Falcao and saying 'we'll get 'em'.

778~~~
Several words pop to mind: Hero, Legend, Le Roi. Take your pick really.

779~~~
With Cantona's words there, you can't help but draw comparisons. When Eric signed, it was huge, he proved to be the catalyst for winning the league. Same thing goes for RVP. Falcao is truly one of the best players in the world and as an out and out number 9, probably the best. We are a long way off winning the title but you never know. With these guys on the pitch, we are a chance at winning any game, no matter how we play.

780~~~
God.

781~~~
The criteria of niceness apparently being if the play for you or not <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

783~~~
Along with Falcao and Blind we got 2 beautiful WAGs too.

They must turn shit at 30, it happens in football manager so it must happen in real life.

785~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

786~~~
Remember when a striker was the last thing we needed but Fergie decided getting RVP and preveint him from going to our rivals was the best move and we then walked the title?

787~~~
Quite a few differences between that season and this one...

788~~~
He should have a statue at OT.

789~~~
Remind me of torres/luis ronaldo peak at the age of 28?

790~~~

791~~~
He is the true king of Old Trafford... Legend, God, King. Had the absolute pleasure of meeting him for an afternoon, a truly nice guy.

792~~~
Wow just wow..........................

You do realise that a 32 year old Ibrahimovic is peaking right now and playing better than ever, I could list another 10/20/30 players who peaked after 30, but you would be to stupid to understand I think.

793~~~
The King <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>  Legend one of favourite ever players to play for the club. The foreigners seem to get how big this club is and respect it more. Can't wait for QPR now <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

794~~~
You do realize that a 22 year and younger ronaldo was among the best players in the history of the game? Or how about rooney/ronaldinho at the age of 28 compared to their younger selves? Or even giggs?

Oh the irony.

795~~~
Meh, not really surprising considering that Madrid/Barca is the pinnacle of football for Latin/Hispanic players. I'm just delighted (and laughing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>) that he rejected City and Liverpool despite their CL offering. 

My only fear is that if he sets the PL on fire this season, Los Francos Blancos might come sniffing <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

796~~~
I'm not denying some players peak early, but you used silly examples. You're basically trying to say players over 28 can't win the ballon'dor or get to that caliber when that's not true at all.

Ribery, Robben, Zidane, C Ronaldo, Ibrahmovic were/are all top class players over the age of 28, Falcao if he looks after himself easily has another 3/4 years of top football left in him.

797~~~
Am I? All am saying is that there is no fixed formula when it comes to players, players who are 28 or above are more likely to break down though, specially if they have come back from a long term injury.

Am very excited about this signing as am not a fan of rooney and RVP is a bit too injury prone and slow for my liking but am not calling those who have doubts over the signing "stupid" or idiots.

798~~~
Obviously, and especially to the rest of the league, but we're far better off now squadwise as well.

Time for LVG to put his stamp on the league

799~~~
Eh, FIFA career mode screwed people's opinions up. When a player turns 30 in career mode, they nose-dive. It's bloody ridiculous. Players rarely do that in the real world.

800~~~
You forgot Van Persie he had his best season at 28 for Arsenal and then had an amazing season for us. I agree with you a lot of players peak late and with Falcao's style of play he can last til 32-33.

801~~~
It's the biggest flaw in football games. They all become arms races, to sign all the best 17 year olds and sell anyone in their late 20's. While you dominate Europe with a squad of 19 year olds.

802~~~
No doubt it was because of his love for United and their footballing philosophy, and not because it's more than likely United threw the most money at him <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

803~~~
Sheikh Mansour could've thrown money at him aswell.

804~~~
Do we have a nailed on agreement to sign him after this year?.

Say he bangs in 30 league goals, what's to stop at the end of this year Madrid coming in and buying him from Monaco?.

805~~~
I thought they only had 3 million to play with or they'd get further shafted by FFP?

<a class="username" data-user="55162, @Adam-Utd" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/55162/">@Adam-Utd</a> We have the 1st choice to buy option on him mate, but with 50 million being the reported fee, would you want to pay that for a 29 year old?

806~~~
I'm fairly sure we'd have first choice in signing him.

807~~~
We have an option to buy him before his loan expires. Nothing to worry about.

808~~~
Aren't they a bit restricted by FFP?

809~~~
We have first option to sign him for 40-43m(IIRC). Thing is though, if Real do bat their eyelashes at him, he can easily just say. "No thanks Man Utd, I don't fancy contract negotiations with you, good luck and that."

Unless you believe Ballague, and it's a permanent deal, with the first year as a loan just to square Monaco's FFP, which means he's ours full stop, good or bad.

810~~~
Eric you beauty, never ever disappoints!

811~~~
Well I suppose we will have to see how it goes, but if he plays anything near his full ability 50m will be worth it.
Hopefully the latter as I fully believe he will be a star for us, but yeah that's what I worry, I think it's clear he is a Madrid fan like most Spanish speakers are at heart, but hopefully he enjoys it enough here to stay.

812~~~
City had €25m euros to play with before they offloaded Richards and Negredo according to Sky.

813~~~

814~~~
No, no, no, all those clubs turned him down and he was forced to come here, thats why we have to pay him 750kpw just to have him here  'Rawk<span style="font-size: 9px"> TM</span>'

815~~~
Balague said Perez isn't a big fan of him.

816~~~
That might change if Benzema has a cack season and Falcao bangs in 20+ goals for us.

817~~~
The loan is perfect. I mean he is 29 years old next year and if he doesn't score atleast 20+ goals taking the option would be insane. Still don't understand the signing, after RvP confirmed that he doesn't need injury. He's a pure 9, even a better out and out striker than RvP, but he isn't anywhere near his level outside the box. The best fox in the box in the game

818~~~
The thing is though, this fee we agreed if we want him at the end of the season, surely Falcao had to agree to that as well right?, meaning that if we take up the option then Falcao has to go with it right?.

819~~~
Benzema has scored like 2 in 16 now. And Perez didn't still buy a forward.

It could change, but apparently Perez doesn't think he'd fit in with Ronaldo and Bale. Which Benzema does.

820~~~
Why is there two threads? Very confusing. Mods?

Anyway, Ronaldo actually voted for Falcao as world player of the year. Rates him.

821~~~
Kind Eric! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

822~~~
No. Monaco have to accept, Falcao can do what he likes. You can't force him into a contract at your whim.

823~~~
The Benz doesn't have to score when you've got Ronaldo (100+ shots a game) and Bale (wishes he had 100 shots a game) in the side.

824~~~
Exactly, swap Falcao with Benzema, and you have to rebuild the side tactically, as Falcao isn't going to play a 100% supporting role for Ronaldo & Bale.

825~~~
I would hope that certain things have been agreed for him to stay (if specific criteria is met on both sides). Otherwise, it would be quite short sighted of us to get rid of 2 strikers, get one on loan and then he disappears elsewhere. 

Leaving us desperately needing a new striker next summer, with our pockets full of cash and every other club knowing it!!

826~~~
From t'other thread, posted in Spring of 2013.

With all the shit Rooney gets over his first touch on here, you'd have to wonder if Falcao will soon be attracting the same ire.

827~~~
Pogue, at least wait until he plays a game for us before you start hating on him. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

828~~~
To be fair, the Rooney criticism disappears when he's scoring goals. If Falcao's banging them in, I couldn't care less what his first touch is like.

829~~~
A bit like Hernandez in his first season for us - we could all tell he had the first touch and technique of a paraplegic seal, but we didn't care because he was banging them in left, right and centre.

830~~~
Henry Winter (clearly knows his stuff):

"Radamel Falcao volleys like Mark Hughes and takes a ball on his instep and sprints towards goal like Thierry Henry. He back-heels like Eric Cantona and converts penalties like Mario Balotelli. Falcao is a scorer of great goals, as his bicycle-kick collection suggests, and also a great goalscorer, as his prodigious tally with Porto, Atlético Madrid and Monaco highlights. Falcao has all the qualities to light up the Premier League"

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

831~~~
No, what you'd have to wonder is if you are going to try your best to find anything negative to say about Falcao as soon as he outperforms Rooney (just like you have been doing with RvP).

Oh and I know you haven't watched Atletico much, at least I hope so, otherwise it would be very hard to believe how little you rated Costa, calling him a one season wonder and comparing him with some other average one season wonders.

So just for you: Simeone's Atletico are a defensive team, the strikers have to control long or difficult balls a lot of time. It's therefore also very difficult for strikers of such teams to impress as they are easy to defend against (compared to an attack which has at least 3-4 attackers rushing to the box all the time). This actually makes Falcao's and Costa's record with Atletico even more impressive.
Anyway, a Barca striker for example will hardly have such bad stats as the ball will be passed to him from 5 yards or via a delicious Iniesta or Xavi through ball which is easy to control, rather than the crosses and long balls Atletico play.

832~~~
Actually, Hernandez had an incredible first touch when he was on top of his game. Remember the game where Giggs pinged a long lofted ball forwards and he killed it dead, before despatching it with his next touch. Think it was against Preston, on a really muddy pitch?

833~~~
Oh behave. Last season Welbeck arguably out-performed Rooney (in the games he played up front) Have I been doing my best to say something negative about him?

Maybe, just maybe, I call it how I see it and Rooney actually did outperform Van Persie last season? (something which the stats seem to confirm)

No, I haven't watched Atletico much. Saw enough of them in the Europa league to think Falcao was a brilliant player, though. Which is why the first touch stat was a little surprising. Hence, I posted it. You need to stop looking for agendas in everything I post. It comes across as slightly paranoid,

834~~~
Benzemas role in the team is not all about goals. His role is somewhat similar to rooneys when Ronaldo was in the team. He is the third goal-scorer of the team after Ronaldo and then bale. That was also the case when both him and higuain where in the team and benzema was played on the right. Benzemas job is to draw defenders away by making runs to provide space for Ronaldo and bale as well as to drop deeps to dictate play and play one-twos to put the other forwards through. If he was the main goal-scorer in a team he could score 30 goals (heck he still managed that in 11/12). With that said, if he was the main man in the team I do not think Madrid could compete with Barcelona or other elite clubs. He is a very good player but not good enough to drag a team to the top with the likes of barca and Bayern around (not many are tbf). His touch is excellent, but at times he can be nervous in the box (even though he scores many goals and some of the are absolutely fantastic goals and first-time hit volleys) and as a result is not reliable to score in crucial moments in big matches or in games where your back is up against the wall and you are not getting much chances and you need your striker to be clinical. That is why it is best to have him play for the team rather than the team play for him.

835~~~
Nope, it's you who comes across as nothing else than an agenda poster when it comes to anything related to Rooney. It's awfully predictable.

836~~~
Whereas your have no agenda of any kind. Interesting. Only you seem to keep dragging my thoughts on Rooney into completely unrelated discussions (see above) I guess I should be flattered to have someone trying to read hidden messages into everything I post but it does come across as a little paranoid. Try and take each post at face value. See how that works? Would have saved me some typing in this thread, that's for sure.

837~~~
Nope, I don't have an agenda. I think RvP is the better player, but I have critisized him a lot here and have defended Rooney when I felt the critics were unjustified. Whereas as far as you are concerned, I can't remember you having anything negative to say about Rooney, even after piss poor performances from him.

838~~~
Still can't believe we've signed Falcao. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

839~~~
So the Falcao transfer has only served to highlight how Eric the King is still the King.

Good stuff.

840~~~
Our aimless crosses into the box might actually pay off this season. Watching a few videos of him, he just seems to fling his head at anything.

841~~~
Yep, if he shows anything close to his old form, then Valencia and Young will have around 15 assists each <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

842~~~
That's City for you. Frugal.

843~~~
Some of you make it sound like he had some career ending injury or something like that. Science isn't what it used to be 20 years ago, players recover from ACL and regain their top form if they're given the right amount of time to heal and are not rushed back in to the game. He's still 28 and as a striker he still has the best years ahead of him. He should be approaching his peak soon enough and I'm certain we will enjoy a Falcao in his greatest condition.

844~~~

845~~~
Isn't it funny how he said the talks went on for months, but we the general public only found out the night before? That is some very private dealing done by Woodward, kudos to the man on that part.

846~~~
I bet Madrid fans right now would have loved to have heard Di Maria setting up Falcao. At the minute it's James to Benzema 

<span style="color: #ffffff">(Or Kroos to Ronaldo....) </span>

847~~~
Is he getting any friendly action? (not a euphemism)

848~~~
"We were in talks for some months". That is how United does business love it!!

849~~~
but when i heard the public opinion and read the newspapers, i thought he was a panic buy? I thought we splashed silly money on players we didnt need?

850~~~
''Watch this space''  ... Woodward you big tease <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

851~~~
If we were in talks for months then we left it bloody late to get the deal done, especially given that Falcao apparently announced on Twitter that he was joining Madrid

852~~~
Yup. I'm a lot more comfortable with regards to him recovering properly as even though he tried his best to make the world cup, and probably could've played like Suarez and Vidal, he didn't take the risk and didn't play. Better for himself long term probably.

853~~~
Wouldn't surprise me if Mendes had spoken to half the world about Falcao, that's how he does business. Talks may have been very informal up until the very last minute. The chatter from Spain is that the Falcao Madrid tweet was Mendes' idea to flush out interest.

854~~~
Watch this space, then he Falcao Punched us right in the space.

855~~~
Still can't believe we've signed Radamel Falcao <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Just surreal.

856~~~
wouldnt that be contradicting? I mean if you announce you are joining Madrid, interest would disappear, especially with Mendes offering him to every club. Everybody knew he was available, you dont have to do this to gain interest in Falcaos case.

857~~~
I think it's relatively safe to presume Mata's been giving him welcome hugs.

858~~~
Why would clubs declare their interest after Falcao states he's joining Madrid?

859~~~
A study in america found 85% recovered to their former level or even better after doing their ACL so I like those chances along with the fact he didn't rush back for the WC like you say.

860~~~
I'd imagine Falcao was in talks with most of the top clubs in Europe at some point, if only to sound them out. I'd also imagine we're constantly keeping contact with potential signings we may never actually end up signing at all. After all, when you're already dealing with Mendes it's very easy to sound out the availability and potential terms of his other players.

In other words I wouldn't read too much into the fact that we had been in contact for that long.

861~~~
If we were genuinely in talks for months, it's even weirder. Just a really weird transfer. Not complaining though.

862~~~
Just like with Rojo as well.

863~~~
fecking hell, what might have been. Oh ... wait <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

864~~~
Yep. I had mine done 2 months ago and my doctor said that most of the time they recover fine, and stronger even if you do all the recovery properly.

865~~~
Probably hints to the fact that they've known for more than a while that Cicha, Kagawa and Welbeck were not long for this club.

866~~~
The only reason some rivals are going on about Falcao wanting to go to Real and not us is because they are peeved he didn't join them. Anyway,So what if he did ? He's at United now.
Reals loss is our gain.

867~~~
That sounds promising. As a recent example, Bebe fecked his ACL just after going on loan to Besiktas, and he's just had a season beyond what anyone would ever have expected from him. Hasn't lost any pace or power

868~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

869~~~
That was study of mainly amateur players of both sexes from the ages of 11 to 53, so those numbers aren't quite representable for professionals.

870~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QzAT2RwpYTI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
English dubbed.

871~~~
Quite right. Though professionals would have better treatment thus greater expected success rate I would imagine.

872~~~
Every time I see this topic I click back thinking I've gone into the transfer forum!

873~~~
Well, in the study only 72% returned to footie at all. That number is certainly greater amongst professionals. But, while 85% of pros might return to play - at least for a while - at the level (as in league/division) they were pre-injury, I'm fairly certain much more that 15% come back as inferior players to some degree. I once read a study of the stats of NBA and NFL players pre and post ACL-reconstruction and 70% or so were never able to match their pre-injury exploits. 

Falcao will be fine. He's started the season very well and even if he's only 95% of what he was, he'll still be one of the best goalscorers in the world for the next three or four seasons.

Worth checking out I reckon. Some stunning skills in these 20 goals.

Yea, im convinved he was shopped round to effectively every top club. it was probably us and madrid left in the running due to ffp etc and apparently madrid were low balling offers. i wish he was more honest about the madrid interest, its a bit frustrating to hear "it was only united etc, best club etc" when he litterally announced he was going to madrid the day before and would have said the same stuff there. Not a massive issue, huge fan and im sure he's really pleased to be here.

876~~~
Who's seen the song Atletico had for him then? It's an absolute belter. Not big on words, but Viva Ronaldo esque.

877~~~
was posted a few pages back. you mean this one?

878~~~
He'll be featuring vs Brazil on Friday ?

879~~~
I think so, he is in the squad and match fit.

880~~~
Belter of a chant, that! Hope we hear it belted out next week in the Stretty.

881~~~
That's pretty much what I think, but United is still a big club and I would like to believe he might have picked us in part because it's United. In his first interview he couldn't contain a smile at all so in any case it seems like he's excited to be here

882~~~
That's the one! Love it. I seem to have been about a day late on the uptake but I can't get the thing out of my head! Class.

883~~~
What have we done.

884~~~
That music destroys brain cells.

885~~~
I usually  mute the music in those clips

886~~~
Doesn't everyone?

887~~~
Watching some videos of him, he's scored quite a few lovely chips. Some of them he chips the keeper from distance like Rooney is always trying to do and never pulling off <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

888~~~
Just read over the first few pages of this thread..some depressing whinging emo cnuts on this board...do yourselves a favour and go support Leeds if you want to be miserable ffs

Took the words right out my mouth Ramshock.

Compilation of his goals at River Plate some of them incredible

893~~~
Amazing that discussions over Falcao had been ongoing for months, but not a peep in the media.

894~~~
Still hasn't hit me quite yet that we just got Radamel fecking Falcao! Can't wait to see him play next week and for his jersey to arrive in the mail.

895~~~
Is the Brazil vs Colombia game on UK TV?

896~~~
Remember when MUTV showed a pre World Cup friendly between the Netherlands and Ecuador? They billed it as watch Antonio take on Robin or something like that. Bill it as watch United's new number 9 or something. It won't happen though.

897~~~
This is all pointing at this deal becoming permanent, I'm delighted. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

898~~~
There's actually hardly any. 

I guess you see what you want to see.

899~~~
It's a cracker, got my 3 year old singing it - we really should be belting this one out, personally I haven't got the bollox to get up and start it, so hopefully the bigger boys will!

900~~~
yeah, I remember buying him in fifa and sold him after season just because I thought he didnt fit to Manchester United and would be the last player to come to us. I was wrong

901~~~
All these and more - I still can't believe we've signed Falcao <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Lord in heaven - Falcao is a Manchester United player! Seems so incredibly crazy, and just when we were getting used to di Maria joining as well <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

902~~~
The funny thing is I keep forgetting about the five other signings <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

903~~~
Make of this what you will, sources are all bit shit (Star, Express) but the original source appear legit.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/angel-di-marias-farewell-real-madrid-letter-caused-radamel-falcao-to-sign-for-man-united-el-confidencial/?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/a...lcao-to-sign-for-man-united-el-confidencial/?</a>

904~~~
Is Ronnie coming home then? He wants to play along side our Gaalacticos doesn't he?

905~~~
We need to create those opportunities for him, which at the moment we are struggling to do for RvP and Rooney.  I wouldn't have had a problem a few years ago, but now?  We have really struggled to stretch defences and hit teams on the break like we used to but hopefully Di Maria will be doing that and making a lot of chances for him.

906~~~
I really need to see this game.

As others have said it's all a bit surreal which - combined with the recent knee reconstruction - means it's all too easy to start worrying if he'll never be the player he was in an Atletico shirt. I mean we couldn't have just signed <i>that</i> Radamel Falcao, could we?

Just need to see him bang in a goal or two (for anyone, against anyone) and it will all seem much more tangible.

907~~~
He already has a few for Monaco this season doesn't he?

908~~~
A signing as big as Falcao will surely get a press conference next week won't he? Not sure if anything has been confirmed as yet.

909~~~
Two, is what <a class="username" data-user="26211, @kouroux" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/26211/">@kouroux</a> said. Need to see him play myself, though. 

Let's not forget, Rooney has also scored two goals!

910~~~
I know what you mean, I've watched the videos of him from the games he has played since he returned and he looks to move exactly the same as he did at Atletico, but I want to see him play a full 90 minutes myself to get a better feel for where he's at, I am praying he bags a couple on his debut, if he gets off the mark against QPR I think he'll be amazing for us.

911~~~
Can anyone understand what made him go to Monaco? Seemed a step backwards to me in a league that was below his talent.

912~~~
€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€

913~~~
It's all to do with the 3rd party ownership getting their payoff.

914~~~
Atletico needed the money and there were some third party ownership issues. Only Monaco were willing to pay the amounts required. Obviously money was the major factor and everyone involved made a shit load of it, except Monaco.

918~~~
When you can earn 12m Euros net after tax, why wouldnt you want to go there?

919~~~
Sounds plausible, would explain his twitter message.

920~~~
I think I remember doing some digging years ago about United strikers and scoring on their debut. Basically, all our best strikers have done so and those who don't rarely turn out a success.

I think Hernandez and Diouf might have bucked the trend, sadly <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

921~~~
Ruud van Falcao. His style really reminds me of that Great Dutchman.

922~~~
1) Money.
2) The owner wanting to transform Monaco into one of Europe's best teams.
3) The arrival of many other good/great players.
4) The example of PSG with their superstars.

A combo of those 4 reasons mainly.

923~~~
In fairness to Hernandez he was a big part of a title winning season that also saw us reach the CL final, so a success just not longevity, as for Diouf.....well you can't win em all. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

The beauty with this Falcao situation is that we do have a safety net in that it's a loan, unless Ballague and co are on the money about the structure of the deal, but I'm looking on the bright side, I feel he'll light up Old Trafford.

924~~~
Ronaldo's coming home! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>, DiMaria suppying Ronaldo would be just cruel.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

925~~~
Is it correct that he has work permit issues too?

926~~~
It'll be much quicker for Falcao, considering his status in the game, and no law trouble in Colombia.

927~~~
It's just a formality. I read the club wanted to fast track it at the British embassy in Miami, whilst he's there for Colombia's friendly.

928~~~
Hernandez would go down as a success wouldn't he? Just for his contribution in that first season alone. 

Alan Smith and Saha did score on their debuts I think though...

929~~~
He had some complicated 3rd party ownership deal that potentially would've stopped him going to Madrid
And Monaco were prepared to buy out all his 3rd parties and pay him <b>very</b> handsomely at the same time because they were trying to emulate PSG at the time and Falcao was the best striker in the world so he raised their profile enormously.

930~~~
Unless he's glassed someone and I missed it in the news, or something.

931~~~
Is best.

932~~~
Honestly I think it was an FFP dodge by Monaco. They add a shitload of assets in Rodriguez & Falcao to their balance sheet in the last year before they qualify for the CL. They make a huge loss, but FFP doesn't matter tl you get in.

They then release the assets and give their turnover a £70M cash boost this season, and £55M next season. That way they can turn a £80M and £65M loss into FFP compliance over the next two seasons.

Obviously it helped that James starred at the world cup, but he was still worth a few bob already.

As for why he consented, it can only be money. Signing on fee perhaps? £10M for one year with the agreement you can leave next summer would do for most players.

933~~~
I believe somebody already posted the link from reddit a few pages back where its all explained in detail. TLDR all to do with 3rd party issues, Making sure the investment group who owned his rights from a young age got their return. and he didn't kick up a massive fuss because he gets to earn phat stacks.

934~~~
I just wanted to quote this post too. Hello Rob.

935~~~
Hey,  asl.

936~~~
<i>He's big, he's bad, Radamel Falcao

Kid starts crying and Falcao starts crying as well.

940~~~

941~~~
Well this is what a call under the radar. It was deadline day morning when the papers still speculated he was going to City and the rumors of him coming here were started one day before the deadline day.

If what he said, that we were in contacts for months, is true there is the last prove that media is clueless.

942~~~
Some journos were reporting it on and off throughout the summer to be fair. I think most ignored it as bs because it just seemed like such an odd target considering the other positions we needed to strengthen. I remember a lot of Falco reports being instantly dismissed in the twitter thread.

943~~~
You sure it was Falcao and not Cavani? Because the latter is the only striker that I recall us being linked to during the summer. Might be wrong.

944~~~
Their owner was taken to the cleaners by his wife in their divorce. He had to pay something like 2.6 billion, half of his wealth.

945~~~
That chant is catchy as hell, love it. 

Also, he comes across as a really nice guy, very likeable one.

946~~~
I was sure... But now you've planted a seed of uncertainty in my mind <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

947~~~
Who are the other two "best clubs"..Real and Barca?

948~~~
It was Cavani to whom we're being linked for more than a year now,

949~~~
At least it was tax-free!

950~~~
So, he'll be a definite starter then. Interesting..

951~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

952~~~
You think there is a chance that a fit falcao wouldn't start?
If falcao hits form I can see Rooney or rvp being dropped to make way for him.

953~~~
Christ, that's steep - it's only £7 a bag of clothes at our local launderette.

954~~~
Needs to man up.

955~~~
I love Falcao.

956~~~
I've only just noticed your name <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> thats the winner. 

I love him too

957~~~
Seriously, fancy a hug?

958~~~
I'll go a jumping up and down hug when he scores his debut goal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

959~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> thought the kid was a bit over the top and dramatic too. Obviously both emotional though, as you would be meeting your idol at that age.

960~~~
He kept touching his knees whilst crying and praying. I'd be doing the exact same thing in his position right now.

961~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

962~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I thought this too. All the other boys were clearly happy but this kid was just bawling. I'm sure this lad will get plenty of banter from that video when he's older.

963~~~
The kid is a drama queen, needs to toughen the f up.

964~~~
Why are all the kids wearing Real Madrid track suits? Definitely some tapping up going on there! <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

965~~~
It's a cultural thing.

Look at James Rodriguez and his team-mates wiggling around like a gang of Ricky Martin impersonators every time they scored in the World Cup...

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkYwWq8LAyA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Dancing, grinning, crying. It's all the same.

Rooney'll sort Falcao out - after a few trips down the chippy with our Wayne, Falcao'll lose those Columbian emotional tendencies and reach the more 'Zen-like' status of 'dead-eyed oaf'.

You can see it happening with Mata, he turned up all 'hugs' and ambition, now look at him, the guy looks like a sullen Hobbit on the football pitch.

966~~~
Steals all the limelight the crafty little git.

967~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> made me laugh out loud.

968~~~
Only now from seeing that River Plate video I remember Falcao being hawked as the next big thing for a fair while until Porto went for him. Thought he was excellent at Porto, bloody amazing at Athletico and at Monaco too until his injury and I have only just realised from watching some of these goal compilations who he really reminds me of as a striker......Batistuta, one of the very best striker who would come alive and score from almost anywhere within 30 yards be it a thunderbolt, dipper, perfectly place shot, chip, volley, header. When you think of DiMarias ability to dribble at the defence to open them up and his crossing and passing ability (which we already saw glimpses of on his debut) its hard not to be excited about how they may link up as a pair within our side and what a big improvement going forwards that could possibly bring. 
ALways been a massive fan of Rio, and its funny to think that is the first defender he will prbably face in the premiership....as much as I loev Rio, I hope I will be stood up applauding about how Falcao-dung Rio like the shit on his shoe to score (yes awful pun)

969~~~
The chant really does seem to work in a stadium doesnt it from the videos...........however, personally Im rally hoping somebody comes up with a chant tp Falcaos Amadeus <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

970~~~
This has been on my mind since we signed him.  Di Maria can cross the ball with pin point accuracy from any where on the pitch, like Beckham he doesn't need to be near the side area between the box and corner flag, he can cross it from much further out Or give a curling pass from direct in front of goal. Its not just Di Maria's passing that's basically perfect, its just that there is no better header of the ball than Falcao from jumping to diving or 2 yards out to 12. Along with this amazing ability of Falcao is his positioning, you'll see in his career goals when he's not scoring crackers/clips with his feet he's tapping them in from 4 yards.

971~~~
I really hope he's recovered from his injury and doesn't have any long lasting damage, the thought of us having the 'Porto/Athletico' player playing upfront for us every week is just mouthwatering <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I'm actually so excited to see him play, but at the same time a little worried that he wont be as good as he was <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

972~~~
Anyone seen the Gazzetto Dello Sport, or whatever the paper is called in Italy, reporting Falcao texting Juventus, saying that he thanks them for the interest "and may move to them in the future"? Seems like the paper/people quoting the paper are twisting it into him wanting to leave United already <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

973~~~
He has got 2 goals this season already for Monaco. Plus in a pre season game against Arsenal he was great. A lot of people also raving about a Monaco game this season in which he scored when somebody raised concerns about him coming back from injury earlier in this thread. Seems to be the normal Falcao.

974~~~
probably wont start against Brazil

975~~~
Better for us that he doesn't play.

976~~~
This is great news for us. He's going to be match fit by the time he comes to United and won't have strained himself too much. The only thing is, he'll be jet lagged. He'll come on as a sub bs QPR.

977~~~
Looking at these comments it definitely sounds like he expects to be here for the long haul and not just a season.

978~~~
He'll have more than a week before QPR. He won't be jet-lagged.

979~~~
This is good. I thought he'd be playing in two friendlies. So Rojo, Di Maria and Falcao will have more than a week to get ready for QPR. Excellent news.

980~~~
Aye, hopefully we can have them back in Carrington early next week so they can start their philosophy studies.

981~~~

982~~~
Looking forward to seeing him play but not seen much of him since he signed for Monaco, saw him a lot at athletico though and if he returns to that level he will be an incredible signing and will be the first name on the team sheet, he is that good. Still suprised he is here mainly because I already thought it was tough to fit RVP! Rooney and mata in so interesting to see if the manager has a clear idea in place of how they will be used or if it is a case of just seeing who takes their chances and then off loading whoever doesn't perform or wants out because we hVe four players whoa re all going to expect and want to play.

983~~~
So the game is at 2:30 CET, who is going to watch it? I'll definitely give it a go (even if he doesn't start as the rumours say).

984~~~
Feck me, it's at 04.00 in the morning in Greece. Lucky I still have summer holidays and don't usually sleep until 6 anyway <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

985~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

986~~~
Can he do it on a cold night in Stoke? If he can he will be the worlds best player no doubt.

987~~~
Philosophical Investigations.  <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

There is a LvG philosophy infographic floating around the internet.  It's structured like Tractatus.

988~~~
Does anyone know which TV channels are showing it? Hope its on Sky

989~~~
Can he play in a midfield 2?

990~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wsi4rjfpwdc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe> 

I desperately want our fans to sing this for the duration of the game. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

991~~~
It'd be interesting with our Manc accents.

992~~~
It is not going to work in a different accent

you cant watch it on uk channels.

It's not on TV in the UK, well, not Sky or BT Sport.

What time is it on UK time?

I sure hope it was, we needed to make sure we weren't paying for a crock.

997~~~
2 am

I should think they will, it's quite catchy. I have been humming it around the office all day, admittedly it has been largely to piss people off.

LJ's Live on sat, tells you every channel that every game is on. Well worth bookmarking <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1000~~~
Ah no problem, Mobdro via Chromecast it is :-)

1001~~~
Thanks for the tip mate :-)

1002~~~
Hmm, I might take a look. Thanks.

1003~~~
No worries, shows you all the channels, so you can get on it in advance if your streaming, motorized sat dish is the way though <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1004~~~
Lol, maybe when I have a job. For now, I will have to use the pixellated goodness of Chromecast <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1005~~~
It doesn't matter if our defending isn't that good, if we can get our attack clicking with the players we have, we should be scoring over 2 goals per game. Falcao doesn't need a lot of chances to score and if we can supply him with 5 good chances in a game, most likely he will be able to score 3 of them.

1006~~~
So the game is actually at 3:00 CET and not 2:30 <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

Falcao better play now!!

1007~~~
On the bench.

1008~~~
I think he'll be on the bench at most. The Colombia coach said he had a busy week or something so would be unlikely to start.

1009~~~
Yup, Falcao is on the bench. Game starts shortly.

1010~~~
Columbia's passing was atrocious, they were a man down but their passing was shockingly bad. I'm glad the Guarin rumours weren't true, awful player. James Rodriguez my word, he was the best of a bad bunch but did RM really sell us Di Maria for this guy Lol, £60m was a bargain if this guy cost £70m. Falcao didnt do much, had a couple touches and almost had chance on goal with a header, impressed with his movement upfront, got himself free into spaces and didn't run aimlessly around the pitch which I like. Hope to see more of him in the next match as Columbia just couldn't hold on to the ball long enough for Falcao to get on the end of it.

1011~~~
The crowd were chanting for him to come on all through the second half and when he did the reaction was like something from a WWE event when a big star returns. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Colombia were so bad he barely got a chance to get involved in his 15 minutes but he did have one decent lay-off and a half chance header, the most pleasing aspect was the sprightliness of his movement looking to create space for a pass should one of his teammates manage to learn how to pass.

1012~~~
Canadian ref was terrible.  Sent Cuadrado off on a 2nd yellow for a pretty innocuous foul on Neymar.  Neymar got fouled again later and did one of the most epic triple salchow rolls I've ever seen.  Looked like his body was bouncing off coils on the pitch! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  He also scored the game's only goal from an amazing free kick into the top corner.

1013~~~
A gif would be great.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

As much as I love Falcao... and he is quite similar, Batigol was something else in his prime.

1015~~~

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Off to find this roll of Neymar!!

1018~~~
I know it was a very short outing for him but that showed no fitness concerns or lack of pace. Looked sprightly enough.

1019~~~
Not sure if you are old enough for this to mean anything but it was A Team quality!

1020~~~
Some footage of him in his Atletico days to tide us over to next week:

1021~~~
What's up with the short sleeves and gloves? Sunny, rainy, cloudy always wearing gloves. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Why would he not be? His surgery was back in January and he starting rehab back in February.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2746300/Man-United-striker-Radamel-Falcao-promises-earn-stripes-goals.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...damel-Falcao-promises-earn-stripes-goals.html</a>

1023~~~
I'm still really really nervous about this transfer for some reason <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

I think its because on the one hand, I'm ridiculously excited about the prospect of the player we've seen over the last few years playing for United, but on the other, I'm worried about him not being as good as that because of the injuries, and flopping.

1024~~~
El Tigre!

1025~~~
I wouldn't be worried about that, he's played 40+ games a season since he's arrive in Europe after his initial damage to one of his knees and apart from that big injury to his knee which he's been given since February to recover from, he doesn't seem to get injured that much.

1026~~~
I was delighted with vanP,but Falcao,feck me weve lucked out.

Genuinely i dont think ive been this happy about a signing.

1027~~~
DI Maria?

1028~~~
Nope. Hes a dream component but always slated him for being a diver but i may have been a little harsh.<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

People think Costa will tear this league up and he will, but he ll do it Our Radamels shadow though.

1029~~~
Most importantly he's got a fighting spirit, which is what a lot of quality players lack coming into the EPL. He's going to be brilliant here <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1030~~~
Defiantly comes alive inside the box alright. Doesn't seem to offer anything special outside the box, has good hold up, and is strong. But inside the box he seems to just burst alive. I just hope we manage to provide him with the ammunition to score a bucket load <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1031~~~
He has that Carlos Tevez feistiness! Loved that in Tevez and to be honest missed it a lot when he left. Another bonus is that Radamel doesn't seem like a complete scumbag! Let the good times roll ladies and gents! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1032~~~
I agree, if I had to name my favourite life time eleven, Batistuta would definately be one of the best strikers that I didnt pick, when Serie A was the big league and on channel 4 before the days of satellite tv and the internet he was one of the best players year in year out, phenomenal striker....to have signed someone similar in both style and talent is very exciting. If Falcao can have half the impact for us Batistuta did at Fiorentina this year we will definately be makign the signing permanent in the summer!

1033~~~
He has tremendous physical strength doesn't he?? I didn't know he had that kind of strength. He can just brush off three four players and power on through! He's one of those strikers that will have an aura of fear around them. A total beast of a number nine.

1034~~~
Not to mention that he didn't risk the World Cup and that would have done him a world of good. 6 months out of the game, and he's had a full pre-season to get his fitness up. Interestingly, he does say that he's not fully there yet, so that leads me to believe that he may not start against QPR. Then again, Robin would have played two games and would need a little rest. Though, he would have recovered for the most bit by Sunday after the game on Tuesday. 

It's up in the air at the moment.

1035~~~
The thought of that... jesus.

1036~~~
Yeah, I think that might be the case. Will be on the bench at least though and what an option to call upon.

Colombia only had one game though which has been played, so depending on the visa issues he should have a full weeks worth of training at Carrington and might be ready to start.

1037~~~
His goal against Barca is one of my favorites so far I think. He took it from the half way line with pace and when everyone would have tried something special or tried to do tricks and go around the keeper, all he did was just chip the ball so calmly as soon as he got into the penalty box. When I watched that live, I was like WOW! Such a cool finish.

1038~~~
Interestingly, he's already played two games for Monaco and he played an hour in one of those matches. He's match-fit, but he didn't play against Brazil because we really worked his knee to the hilt. Apparently we gave him a very intense his test on his body fitness hoping to avoid another Hargreaves scenario and that's why he was tired out for Colombia. What did we do to him!?

1039~~~
6 squats with anderson on his shoulders!

1040~~~
That is a hard test. Apparently it testes their balances as well like a wobble board with Anderson eating donuts at the same time. 

That can get pretty intense.

1041~~~
Falcao's jersey might be the first real jersey I purchase from MUFC if he stays

1042~~~
I seriously cannot wait to see him in a united shirt! Next week cannot come quick enough for me. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1043~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ol3CRl-H09Q?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1044~~~
He needs match sharpness to get back, real match experience. Fitness wise I think he's alright.

1045~~~
I'd start him against QPR just to get the crowd buzzing from the off. Doubt he will last more than an hour though but by then I hope we are in a commanding lead. Di Maria first game at OT also so it should be quite an occasion plus the debuts for Blind and Rojo and possibly a few injured players will be back. 

Surely us fans wont be left disappointed again and LvG gets his first win of the season.

1046~~~
It will be great to hav someone that can 'hold the ball' up front.

The current bunch of forwards at a United haven't been interested in holding the ball up for a few seasons now.

Only another week to go...the wait is killing me!

1047~~~
What? Van Persie holds the ball up as well as anybody. Even Welbeck was capable of that when he played up front

1048~~~
This. I'm fully expecting to see a different United against QPR compared to what we've seen the past 3 weeks. I'm hoping they dominate the Sunday back pages the next day.

1049~~~
Of course we will. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> If Rafael, Rojo, Blind, Falcao, Herrera and Shaw start, that's 6 new players in the starting 11. Exciting times!

1050~~~
Its not me that's skeptical. Its the numerous people who doubted whether he'd be the same player he was prior to the injury.

1051~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/9459474/premier-league-radamel-falcao-ready-to-make-impact-at-manchester-united" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www1.skysports.com/football/...cao-ready-to-make-impact-at-manchester-united</a>

1052~~~
What??? RVP hasn't don't that for a <i>few seasons</i> now! if only i'd made that clear in my original post! <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1053~~~
RVP is excellent and holding up the ball. It might not look like it as it's not your tall striker knocking them down for runners or bringing them down on his chest but when he receives the ball at his feet, his body positioning is excellent and brings players into the game as good as any striker. Again, it deosn't look like your typical target man but he is much better at holding the ball up than people give him credit for.

1054~~~
Do you think it would be more sensible to let the new lads gel in with the squad and build up a style of football and then unleash them a few weeks later, or do we just let them get on with it. I think LVG will just put them all in in all honesty, but I just hope that we just get the result and build up some confidence right away.

1055~~~
I think the players are just so low on confidence and form we need to bring fresh players in. The likes of Shaw, Herrera, Blind, Di Maria and Falcao will be raring to go.

Its a risk to throw them all in and hope for the best, but its also a huge risk for us at the moment to continue with the likes of Fletcher, Valencia, Young etc who are continuing to underperform

1056~~~
Yep! that is true...but the point i was making was we haven't seen enough 'hold-up' play at United for a few seasons now. RVP did it in the title winning side 2 seasons ago!!! but since then it has been missing badly from the side.

I'm hoping Falcao can bring that back.

1057~~~
Is he better than Aguero?

1058~~~
Somehow I don't like the words United and project in one line, it's so plastic.

1059~~~
I agree that lately, he hasn't been on top of his game, especially this part of his game but I can't accept the argument of a 'few seasons'. I mean look at it, this season is 3 games in. There was last season under Moyes and before that Fergie's last season and RVP's first. I agree that last year he was below par but under Fergie, he was great and you have noted that, so really it's been a season and 3 games that he hasn't given us that. Not a 'few seasons'.

1060~~~
We pretty much are a project though, we simply haven't undergone a transition period like this before in our recent history.

1061~~~
Very few players in world footballer are better than a fit Sergio Aguero, the guy simply doesn't miss, Give him the ball 1v1 against a keeper from pretty much any angle and it will end up in the back of the net.

Falcao is a better player in the box for sure, but Aguero might be a little better outside it, both are deffo up their along with Suarez as the top 3 strikers in world football imo, they also have immense composure .

1062~~~
We'll find out soon enough. If you only look at historical stats, both have scored the same amount of goals (200), but Falcao has done it in 100 less matches.

1063~~~
Very tight but yes.

His dominance in the air has him shading it for me,everything else they are matched but have very different styles.

We all know Aguero fairly well at this stage,but wait till this league get a blast of our new vanBasten/van Nistelroy hybrid.

1064~~~
hehe gotta love the internet...i'm not gonna argue over what defines a 'few seasons' 

I'm looking forward to seeing Falcao <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> the end! move on!

1065~~~
Falcao's peak is higher than Aguero's peak for sure, Falcao was the best striker in the world for a quite long period. He has done well at Monaco, people who sometime watch the French Ligue can see that its a very lowscoring league.

1066~~~
Aguero is a quality player but he hasn't been any better than Rooney or RVP in the last couple of years in my opinion. The question for me is will Falcao be as prolific in this league as he has been in Spain and France?

1067~~~
It's a none scoring league, the defenders are fast and powerful. And the teams play negative football with real brilliance. Only Ibrahimovic and Drogba bossed this league with ease.

1068~~~
Even Drogba didnt boss it, his highest amount of goals was 19.

1069~~~
Surely, you're only saying that because of Aguero's injury problems? Had he stayed fit and played consistently I think only RVP could match him.

1070~~~
He's easily been better than Rooney in fairness.

1071~~~
Can we please put off our glasses? This is just ridiculous. Rooney hasnt been really good for the past 2 seasons, and its so obvious that he has declined. Cant remember the last time he even went past a defender.

1072~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1073~~~
I think he will start on the bench. Given the whole 'nervousness after the injury' line I reckon we will ease him in. (I will unashamedly admit that I already have the 'lolololololo' chant stuck in my head!)

1074~~~
Since he arrived at Man City, Aguero has scored 54 goals in the league. Rooney has scored 57. NThe both got 17 goals last season. You'd swear Rooney was no better than Heskey reading this forum.

1075~~~
Got tickets for the QPR game so excited to see his debut. Hopefully we'll see Shaw, Rojo, Blind, Herrera, Falcao and Di Maria along with Rafael who has been a big loss recently.

1076~~~
This! I hate it! Stop calling it a project ffs!

1077~~~
You need to exclude penalties from any goal scoring comparisons.

1078~~~
I'm not big on stats but isn't his minutes to goal ratio the best of all scorers in the PL? He does seem to be injured a lot so that sounds like a great goal return.

1079~~~
And being injured a lot is a good thing?

1080~~~
...Erm what?

1081~~~
No, I don't agree.

1082~~~
A goal every 115 mins I believe.

1083~~~
No he is clearly saying that his goalscoring record is very impressive considering he is quiet injury prone.

Anyone suggesting that Rooney is even on par with Aguero needs their head checked. There is however an argument that RVP is at Aguero's level. Rooney on the other hand? No. Just no.

1084~~~
Inuries define careers. Messi and Ronaldo wouldn't be as lauded as they have been if they were not as freakishly injury-free as they were at their peak. Maybe Aguero would be seen as as at their level if he was as injury free. But he has not been, and thats football.

Knowing that your main striker will probably be injured again soon is not very comforting even if you know he's deadly on the days he is available. Even in the games he does not score in he'd surely be contributing.

I'd rather Falcao scored 15 goals in 30 games for us and avoid injuries, than score 20 goals in an injury hit season where he only plays 20 games. The strike rate might be more impressive, but I'd prefer consistency to the team, knowing he is always available, and I'm sure he'd be contributing mightily to the team even when he does not score just by terrifying defenders and freeing others.

1085~~~
A fit Aguero is for me slightly better than a fit Falcao and RvP. Very close between them though when in form.

1086~~~
We can't really tell until they play in the same league but I would say that Aguero is in a upwards pointing form while Falcao's last season was full of injuries and when he played it wasn't outstanding.

In form they are both equally talented though. Aguero has better dribbling, close control and the ability to make things happen on his own. 

Falcao is a better finisher, inside and outside of the box. 

So whoever has a team which plays to their strengths better will be the one performing at the higher level. Aguero already has a team well suited to his strengths though, while Falcao is still a question mark. 

Worth to note is that Aguero is two years younger as well and most people would say that at 26 he's just reaching his peak.

1087~~~
I agree. I'm just saying the point being made was that given how many injuries Aguero has had his strike rate is more impressive than Rooney's. The debate was who is the better player between Rooney and Aguero. Injuries don't come into it when considering a players talents.

1088~~~
Monster of a goal scorer. A year back, he was the best no. 9 in the world. Better than aguero, Rvp, cavani and the likes.

1089~~~
Aguero is extremely injury prone though, and it's always recurring muscular injuries. Not beyond the realms of realism to suggest that he's past his physical best.

1090~~~
To be honest, I'll trade a fully
fit aguero for all 3 of Rooney, RVP and Falcao.

I do think he'll improve our team more than the 3 strikers we have at United combined. He's really that good when on form. I think the only striker on par would be Suarez.

1091~~~
I'd trade all four for a fully functioning midfield and defence.

1092~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1093~~~
Not really,on form theres not much between them but Aguero shades it.

Remember we re comparing a 9 and a 9 and a half,Rooney assists add a different facet which many will argue on top of his goals he contributes more.Which is a valid enough argument.

VanP hasnt been at anywhere near Agueros level,injuries included ,for over a year.Maybe a little less,9 months.Thats not saying he isnt as good or better when bang in form though,its just its been a while.

1094~~~
Our attack is less fuctioning than our midfield and defence, we have conceded 3 goals goals in 3 matches (1 shouldnt be allowed, and we havent played our best defence yet, Rafael, Shaw, Smalling, Rojo havent played yet) but we have scored 2 goals in 3 matches and havent created 5 chances...  We havent given the opponents defence a hard time, our defence is way better than our attack on the field. RVP, Mata, Roo have been far worse than our defenders.

1095~~~

Like I said Sonnry, Augero hasn't been any better in the last couple of years than Rooney <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1096~~~
That's plain dumb really. To ignore the fact that Aguero is rarely fully fit, a combo of RvP and Rooney alone brings more than Aguero on his own. Saying you would trade in Falcao too makes it even more ridiculous.

1097~~~
Thank feck you're not in charge of the team. So assuming Aguero's fully fit, then the other 3 are too then? Just to be fair.

1098~~~
Do you want me to deduct goals from Rooney because Augero has injury problems? There is not much I can do about that! The plain truth is in the last couple of seasons Augero has been no better than Rooney. If that's becauseRooney's  dipped in form or Augero's injury problems then who cares. But that's what is in the record books. I'm not saying Rooney is better or worse I'm just stating the facts for the past two season. If people want to take a goals per minute or dress it up whatever way then fine. But in a supposedly weaker team and for a man who is meant to be in decline Rooney has matched one of the best strikers in the world for goals and beaten him for assists. Sometimes people don't appreciate what they have till its gone.

1099~~~
Agüero is a top player but I really don't think he'll ever overcome his injuries. He may - like van Persie - manage one or two full seasons without any, but then when the comedown occurs and he does pick them up, he'll be older, and they'll begin to last longer. He's also, unlike van Persie or Falcao, very reliant on acceleration and sharp agility and balance, which will decrease further as the injuries persist.

1100~~~
For me, Aguero is 26 years of age and has about 4-5 years of top level football left. And I did state the assumption of a 'fully fit' Aguero who's not injury prone. 

Adding in the fact that we have Di Maria, Januzaj and Mata, I would think a front 3 of Aguero/ADM/Januzaj would be much more balanced in terms of speed and creativity. 

That's added with Mata being supported by 2 relatively hardworking midfielders in Herrera and Blind (I still hope for Vidal or even Henderson-like players). It'll definitely allow Mata to play to his strengths rather than what we see in matches now. 

Now that would be much better in my book, and if we can get in a few decent players to be their backup, our team which be infinitely more balanced.

Of course it'll be a bad deal to replace our 3 strikers with Aguero <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>, but I prefer a balanced team compared to a team where you have to play all your damn star players.

1101~~~
Let's not be silly now. Surely there isn't even a need to refer to a text book to determine that Aguero was better than Rooney last season? I know it's all about opinions,  but i genuinely reckon attempting to seriously argue that Rooney has been better than Aguero for the past two seasons almost calls the credibility of the caf into question. It's the kind of debate I'd be embarrassed for a non United fan from the outside to see.

1102~~~
Please add the amount of appearances.

1103~~~
I personally prefer Aguero's playing style to our 3 current strikers. He has that certain explosiveness, ability to pass players and pace that our current 3 strikers lack. Ability wise I think RvP and Falcao are on the same level with Aguero, but I just really enjoy teams with a front 3 that can defeat teams on the counter, and that's only if we have Aguero/ADM/Januzaj (He's not really that fast though) as our front three. Rooney/RVP/Falcao wouldn't be able to do that, and would make us have to play a completely different way.

Of course it's a bad deal, but it'll bring a much needed balance to our team IMO. And it's kind of my dream to see another team similar to that of a 07/08 Ronaldo/Tevez/ Rooney (Who could actually pass players back then) front 3 playing for United.

1104~~~
I get the impression a lot of United fans have never really watched Falcao and don't realise how good he actually is.

1105~~~
This.

He's better than Aguero. Probably the best striker in the world.

1106~~~
Worth nothing that Aguero played around 3500 minutes in that time and whereas Rooney played just under 4500. And of course the manner in which the goals were scored and the general influence in all round play are factors in who was better, both of which are strongly in Aguero's favour it has to be said.

1107~~~
The more I read the caf the less necessary I feel it is to watch footy at all. All you need is Wikipedia or whatever site these geeks get their stats from.

1108~~~
I'm more concerned about is he as good as he was.

1109~~~
He's an astonishing player <i>if </i>he gets back to his best.

However, do his attributes allow us to change the way we play up front? Something which clearly isn't working right now.

1110~~~
My Barca supporting friend reckons Falcao is the best striker in the world and we United fans don't seem to realize just how good he is.

1111~~~
He's absolutely right. 

People keep talking as if it's a Drogba back to Chelsea signing. 

He's 28 and world class. He's going to be sensational.

1112~~~
This is pure torture. It's like knowing what you're getting for Christmas but it's still a week away.

1113~~~
The wait is driving me nuts too!

1114~~~
The second Falcao signed for United he aged 10 years and because semi-decent.

The second Welbeck joined Arsenal he because twice the player he ever was at United.

The world of football. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1115~~~
Aguero's injury problems are being overstated I feel. He picks up regular niggles (more in the last 18 months) but last season was the first time he hasn't played 40 games since he moved to Europe. 

The best thing about him is he quite often doesn't come back with any rust at all. Certainly not like Rooney who can often take forever to find some rhythm.

1116~~~
Browsing through other football forums, especially RAWK, gives me the feeling that Falcao has the technique of Heskey and is should be in an Old Folks Home rather than playing on a football pitch.

1117~~~
I hope we'll provide him with decent amount of chances each match.

1118~~~
What I'll give to see us have a decent midfield and defence. Di Maria and Mata supplying Falcao upfront with RVP/Rooney would be quite a sight to behold.

1119~~~
I feel the same, I woke up this morning thinking it was today and then remembered the damn international break. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1120~~~
Imo RvP at his best is better than Aguero and Falcao at their best. RvP's link up play and ability to produce moments of magic out of nothing is crazy. His first half of the 12/13 season was immense. Although it's been a bloody long time since he has been in that form

1121~~~
Well, you are in luck. Because there's actually a chance of seeing an in-form Falcao and RVP up front this year.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1122~~~
When ever have two world class strikers played well together?

1123~~~
At that moment Zlatan and Adriano, Torres and Villa,

1124~~~
Shearer and Sutton <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1125~~~
Di Stefano & Puskas
Dwight Yorke & Andy Cole
Ronaldo & Rivaldo
Henry & Bergkamp
Dalglish & Rush
Emilio Butragueno & Hugo Sanchez
Pele & Garrincha

1126~~~
Aguero has the best goals per minute ratio in Premier League history. It's fair to say he's better than Rooney.

1127~~~
Javier Hernandez had the best goals per minute ratio in Premier League history for quite a while, was he better than Rooney then?

1128~~~
Benson & Hedges

1129~~~
Slightly before my time but Romario and Stoichkov?

1130~~~
I'm too young to comment on those in bold. Rivaldo is my favourite player of all time, he was more of an attacking midfielder.

1131~~~
Rivaldo, Bergkamp, Dalglish and Garrincha weren't strikers were they?

1132~~~
hehe exactly!...and don't forget United are paying him £385k a month <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1133~~~
DId Zlatan and Adriano actually play well together though? Or was it just Zlatan beasting Serie A as per usual. Adriano had declined by that point.

Torres and Villa was a case of two strikers at their peaks playing well but not as two strikers. Villa played behind and off to the left.

1134~~~
<a class="username" data-user="47218, @matherto" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/47218/">@matherto</a> I think you're right to point to the fact that some of the 'partnerships' listed were not actually partnerships in the truest sense. However, that being said many of those suggested have been great front two's and Zlatan, for instance, played well with Larsson who was also world class.

World class forwards can play well together, we just have not seen much of that recently because playing one up top has been the fashion for the last 10 years. However, in places where the front two has come back into fashion e.g. Serie A. You can still find top players linking up well together.

Radamel Falcao played quite well with Diego Costa, if memory serves?

1135~~~
Adriano was also brilliant at that time, and of course Bergkamp (not really really a 9) and Henry

1136~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px">Diego Forlan and Luis Suarez.
Jurgen Klinsmann and Rudi Voller.
Deigo Forlan and Sergio Aguero.
Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton .</span>

1137~~~
If anyone has the article in which Paul Merson says Danny Welbeck is better than Falcao and that Falcao won't be that good for Utd I'd like to have a read please.

1138~~~
Wow less than Young <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1139~~~
Garrincha was a winger-forward (Similar to Ronaldo), Dalglish was a striker and Bergkamp was definitely a second-striker. True, Rivaldo was more of a second-striker/Attacking midfielder.

The partnership between Henry and Bergkamp was simply majestic <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> I know I'm an United fan but I could certainly see the appeal of Arsenal back then.

1140~~~
Haha. Classic Merse.

1141~~~
If one of our strikers got Bergkamp numbers for goals in a season they would be crucified on the Caf.

1142~~~
Well, if one of our strikers had Bergkamp's ability on the ball I think the Caf would be too busy with their right-hand than to bother typing coherent sentences to crucify him on the Caf.

1143~~~
Bergkamp was always a scorer of great goals rather than a great goalscorer. That pirouette goal is my favourite non United Premier League goal ever!

1144~~~
To be fair Berbatov got a lot of stick despite being one of the most eye-catching strikers in modern football. Perhaps not Bergkamp level in terms of gracefulness but he came pretty close. I'm not sure even the likes of Zidane or Laudrup would be Ballon D'Or winners in the current era.

1145~~~
Some reports saying he is actually born in 84 instead of 86?

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bxbX59TDaAw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Seems this was reported a while ago also:  <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/07/23/radamel-falcao-age_n_3638143.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/07/23/radamel-falcao-age_n_3638143.html</a>

1146~~~
From the age of 26-30 at Arsenal, he played a part in 40-50% of their goals scored. He was an assisting machine, main playmaker and a scorer of great goals. He won't get the Ballon D'Or because of Messi and Ronaldo, but he'll still be rated as one of the best players in the Premier League era. 

Berbatov was certainly pleasing to the eye, but Bergkamp is quite a class above Berbatov in terms of contribution to the team.

1147~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.espn.co.uk/PICTURES/CMS/51400/51421.jpg" src="http://www.espn.co.uk/PICTURES/CMS/51400/51421.jpg"/>

1148~~~
Relieved.

1149~~~
Berbatov wasn't effective though. His talent was incredibly overrated too, he had one of the best first touches you'll see but not much else really.

1150~~~
Yeah I stand corrected on that one. Maybe Berbatov wasn't the most apt comparison in terms of productivity. Looked up some Bergkamp stats and his assist numbers are ridiculous from the mid to late 90s and one peak beyond that :

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41916000/gif/_41916108_goals_assists_416.gif" src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41916000/gif/_41916108_goals_assists_416.gif"/>

The total for him would be :

1995 : 29
1996 : 31
1997 : 42
1998 : 31

and 33 in 2001/ 2002. And to think this number could be even higher if not for him well documented case of aviophobia.

1151~~~
The United player that most reminds me of Bergkamp right now is Mata. Both have very little pace and great technique, have amazing playmaking abilities and an eye for the pass, and have relatively good goal-scoring records. Bergkamp had a certain grace when he dribbles and had a great team around him, something that Mata lacks in the current United set-up. I think that's the key difference between the two players which I hope Van Gaal would address.

1152~~~
Salas-Zamarano were pretty special tbf

1153~~~
Get them all in straight away if fit. We haven't got the time to bed them in to be honest, considering our first 5 fixtures many fans were predicting a lot of points, so far it has been quite abysmal. Now is the time to get the confidence up with this QPR game at OT. They have lost their best forward to Chelsea and with Rio and co at the back looking almost as calamitous as our defence so far, I think we need the big guns in to punish them.

If LvG sticks to his formation (I personally hope he reverts to 4 at the back) I can see Rojo left of the three with Blind LWB, Valencia RWB and hopefully a fit again Herrera in midfield with Di Maria with Mata, Rooney then supporting Falcao. I know that is very attack minded but I don't really believe Fletcher brings anything defensive to the team plus it is QPR and not Man City or Chelsea. 

I think we will put three past them and really give the fans something to be positive about and the players good confidence going to Leicester the following week.

1154~~~
IMO that's all he has to do, with a system that uses width then it'll all slot into place, really hoping to see 4 at the back against QPR.

1155~~~
Bollocks <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1156~~~
I can picture Falcao being lovable like Mata, he seems so genuine and always smiling!  Rojo another who's being dubbed ''likely to be a fan favorite''  and the two of them seem to want to be here at United, including Di Maria, Herrera and Blind. I think we've done extremely well on not only the players ability on the pitch but also off the pitch. Not sure about Shaw though, seems a great chap but he's a Chelsea fan <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1157~~~
Check Berbatov's stats at Spurs. They are quite similar to those, Spurs were a far worse team than Bergkamp's Arsenal though.

1158~~~
Totally agree, this is spot on

1159~~~
Was the one that sprang to mind for me. Pallister and Bruce totally ripped to pieces. They seemed to have a telepathic understanding much like Yorke and Cole, the only difference beign individually they were both far better players, both absolute stars. Shame romario seemed to move on so quickly as for the time it lasted I cant remember a better partnership to be honest

1160~~~
Falcao plays for us......

Insanely ridiculous that we can even say that

1161~~~
It's amazing that when he was at Athletico or Monoco no one bought up his age or any other negative thing about him. Now his a UTD player apparently his a old crippled money hungry blood sucking beast! I can't wait till we play again and hopefully he scores and the world will be in total meltdown...

1162~~~
Romario and Bebeto was pretty nifty too. Though we wouldn't need anything that good.

If Falcao can forge a partnership at United, similar to the one he had with Costa at Atleti, we'll be set.

1163~~~
Couldn't care less, so long as he scores the goals

1164~~~
To be fair he became a money hungry blood sucking beast as soon as he opted for Monaco above all other clubs. Subsequently became a cripple too. Its not just because he's at Utd that the whole world thinks this now.

His lack of ambition and football-morals precedes his arrival at Utd.

1165~~~
Could be the first time in the history of football that the "what a waste of money" chant gets used on a loaned player <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I have no doubt he'll score goals though. Just his presence the other day was making the Brazil defenders shit themselves, and he was only on for 5-10 minutes

1166~~~
Was that move solely down to him though?

1167~~~
That was to do with 3rd party ownership.

1168~~~
According to today's papers, Rooney is looking for showdown talks with Van Gaal, as he is angry and confused over the arrival of Falcao <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He has previous so, hard to know if it's true <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1169~~~
Fair enough, it kind of almost makes him a footballing non-entity. Just a piece of unfortunate luggage. Either way, all fans of opposing teams can see is a footballer with no ambition.

1170~~~
But Aguero is actually better than Rooney.

1171~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It seems like Rooney is "angry and confused" the whole time these days!

1172~~~
If it's true, then he's looking for showdown talks with the wrong man...

1173~~~
I hope it's true. Out of Mata, Rooney and RVP I hope it is him that loses out with the arrival of Falcao.

1174~~~
You should put that bottle of white lightning away mate.

1175~~~
Would be funny if he went on another one of his "we have no ambition" rants behind the scenes, regarding transfers..so LVG goes out and buys a better striker than him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1176~~~
Would be hard to argue a case for Rooney 'not' being confused to be honest.

1177~~~
Weird thing to say about someone with a better big game goalscoring record than .. well .. almost anyone.

1178~~~
Normally I wouldn't believe it but, it came from the same paper Kevin Moran writes for....

Kevin Moran is Paul Stretford's boss. Wayne Rooney's agent.

Might be a hint of truth in it

1179~~~

1180~~~
What paper is running with it?

1181~~~
Sunday World (I know)

1182~~~
Every time I see this thread on the front page I think "That guy actually plays for us now. Awesome."

And then I start cursing the international break for delaying his debut.

1183~~~
Didn't Rooney come out the other day and say he was excited about Falcaos arrival?

1184~~~
He was confusing that with anger, now he's all a dither.

1185~~~
Aye...I just found it interesting seen as Kevin Moran works for that paper

1186~~~
I hope we have enough ambition to bench him for a Falcao/Mata combo.

1187~~~
Doubt the captain would get dropped from the preferred starting line-up. He does need to up his game though. I think he needs the Bobby Boucher treatment to get the best out of him

1188~~~
Nonsense. Zlatan and Thiago went to PSG when they were a non-entity much like Monaco. Did they lack ambition too ?

As for morals that's pretty rich for the fan of a club and management that backed Suarez to the hilt when he chomped, stamped on and racially abused people. And then to see your manager come out with pearls about how Saint Luis gave him life lessons.

1189~~~
Forgot Moran wrote for them. I didn't know about the link with him and Stretford so there may be something in it. But then again it is the Sunday World. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1190~~~
A money hungry blood sucking beast that uses his image rights to fund charity campaigns for sick and homeless children.

1191~~~
There's bitterness and then there's this TBF. Can see why he chose that username now. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1192~~~
Who would be stupid enough to try strong arm LVG? I don't believe the story.   He just signed a new deal last year though so if he is to be sold surely we'll get £35 odd million.

1193~~~
If its true, I suppose LvG wouldn't mind it all. Valid excuse to boot him out?

Owned.

1196~~~
Obviously. I mean he could have turned down the chance of playing for the biggest club in English premiership history, considering we only have dross like Di Maria, RVP, Rooney and Mata to link up with. The better option of course would have been to join Rickie Lambert, Adam Llalna and Dejan Lovern at Southampt...err I mean Liverpool.

1197~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Dumbstar Umad bro?

Poor old Falcao with no ambition, maybe he should be down with the "Brendan Rodgers Southampton revolution" squad, playing in a shite 45,000 seater stadium famous for its "European nights" which we're constantly told by Stevie G and good O'l Carragher. 

Jokes aside, Falcao was pretty much forced to go to Monaco by his 3rd party owners anyway, he's shown plenty of ambition in realising that money isn't everything and has decided to move on.

He can now showcase his skills in the worlds most famous football league, playing for by far the leagues biggest club and in a packed 75,000 mega stadium in which it's fans will constantly roar his name. I think he's shown plenty of ambition tbh.

Who do you think will have won more by the end of their career?

We should just let them find out for themselves. They will be eating their words in a few weeks.

1201~~~
It really is funny the way people's opinions change in a matter of days. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

1202~~~
It would have been the sensible thing to do if the rest of the squad wasn't moping nervously everytime they stepped on to a football pitch.

I'd definitely play most of the new players we can possibly play against QPR. They haven't been through this United collapse and that is an advantage we can use, not to mention the footballing benefits of playing better footballers.

1203~~~
Sorry if this has been discussed to death on here before (I've been away with very sproadic internet access) but is Falcao completely out of the woods as far as that knee injury is concerned? It's the one thing that stops me from being incredibly excited about the coming season

1204~~~
It seems like he has gotten over it. He has played a few matches this year already and he seems to be moving without any problems.

Im guessing him, Di Maria and Rojo are back in training today?

1205~~~
Its annoying when rival fans keep mentioning his fee as EUR20m. When have people started adding the wages of an incoming player to determine their fee? 

Are we doing the same for Chicha to Real or Torres to Milan, etc.?!

1206~~~
Whilst I'm 95% convinced he will be a success and that lvg must have a plan in mind to utilise all the attacking talent there is a small part of me that keeps thinking it could end up like Veron.

An undoubted talent and unquestionably one of the best in the world in his position.

But so are rooney and Rvp and just like when we tried to add Veron into an amazing midfield it could be detrimental to us.

I hope not but I have a nagging doubt until I can actually see it working

1207~~~
That was an amazing midfield. But what we've seen from RVP & Rooney up top together ( especially more recently ) has been far from an amazing attack. 

Falcao will hopefully come in and offer something exciting and different up front.. And let's face it we fecking need it.

1208~~~
Falcao will be the first name on the team sheet as a number 9, it's a question of where the others will fit and not him.

1209~~~
Veron hardly set the world alight at Chelsea either. It simply just didn't work out for him in the Premier League.

1210~~~
We added Veron to a midfield of great quality and tried to change the system to accommodate him. 

Rooney and RVP have been pretty poor for a while and we'll probably bench one of them so I think it's just a straightforward injection of quality.

1211~~~
Just a week left to wait now. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1212~~~
He played 3 games in Ligue One this season and scored twice. He also took off the proper time to rehab the knee as suggested by his specialists as opposed to Vidal who came back early.

Also, I'm not quite sure why people earlier in the thread label him as injury prone. The cruciate he did at Monaco was from a horror tackle, it didn't just buckle.

Either way, the fact that it's a loan means it's win win for us. He lights the league on fire, it's a permanent deal. He's a crock, we move on.

1213~~~
Thanks guys! I was chuffed when we signed him and even more so now.

1214~~~
Rvp should be benched. Rooney hasn´t been much better but atleast he seems to give a feck. We should not have sold Welbz, I really can´t believe that decision. Hopefully Wilson will make a push for the first-team. Falcao together with Di Maria, De Gea, Rojo and Herrera are the ones that should start week in week out.

1215~~~
what about his other injuries, were they also from horror tackles (genuine question - I'm curious?)

1216~~~
Don't worry about it. It's a very European thing. The French & Spanish call everything a project. Falcao would have said that even if he joined Liverpool or West Ham or Subway. It's a positive statement about a particular phase in his life.

1217~~~
I have just checked the last 5 seasons club games (since he came to europe) and for a comparison in that period he has played 197 times (and he was out for half of last season) whilst carrick (a player I don't consider to be injury prone and who has not had a long spell out) has played 212 times

So actually up to his bad injury he had played more games than carrick in the five years pervious - If you take into account interantionals he has actually played more games than carrick over the last five years even taking into account his half a season injury.

Now I do consider anybody coming off a long injury without having fully recaptured their previous form for a sustained period a risk... I also think the breakdown of his goals stats here highights another risk - especially those judging him by stats alone <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2014/09/02/here-is-why-manchester-united-is-taking-a-risk-with-falcao/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/...nchester-united-is-taking-a-risk-with-falcao/</a>

But I don't see a player who is regularly injured - and as I say over 5 years the games played indicates he is certainly fit the vast majority of the time.

1218~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> why Carrick?

Either way you are right it was a bad injury rather than injury prone. Encouraging he has played 4 games to some degree this season and had the WC off to recover

1219~~~
He got injured back in January. He didn't rush his return to play in the WC. He had surgery, rested and came back 6 months later. And he says he feels like before. He is confident he is back. We have to take his word for it. Our medical staff must have done their part. Im excited. You should be too.

1220~~~
Why Carrick... Well as i was looking for a player who wasn't injury prone I kind of ruled out our entire defence and fletcher / Rvp
there wasn't many outfield players left who get in the team when fit and are fit most of the time - unfortunately
Fingers crossed falcao turns out good and at least if Rvp suffers one of his all to frequent injuries we shouldn't suffer

1221~~~
Because apart from Carrick, how many of our outfield players have both a) played regularly and b) not missed loads of games through injury.

I'm not overly concerned by the injury. The thing that has me a little off about a permanent transfer is the combination of his age and the costs involved, but I guess we have the rest of the season to evaluate the benefits and negatives of a permanent move. (unless it is actually a cast-iron transfer under the guise of a loan so that Monaco can spread the cost for FFP - as has been suggested)

Damn you. I wish I hadn't read that <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1223~~~
No not really- that team has not played together yet so we cannot judge- not a chance all 6 new signings will start vs QPR fit or not- it will take time for all of them to bed in.

1224~~~
Really not that concerned - Falcao is on another level when it comes to his overall game and consistency compared to one season wonders like Soldado and Negredo.

1225~~~
More or less... yes! As I said in this thread earlier, not everyone is an 'Owen Hargreaves' or an 'Alejandro Faurlin'. Look at good ol' Bebe. He got the same injury two years ago and the season after he was beast of a player for Pacos. Proper rehabilitation without risk is the key. Falcao was injured in January. He started rehab in February. He'd been doing that till June-early July. He had a full pre-season with Monaco. Played against Arsenal and scored. He's played three games for Monaco this season and scored twice. He underwent a severe medical at United, so much so that the he was tired for the friendly against Brazil. He's fit and fine. Also remember the players that usually don't recover are the ones where the knee just breaks down on its own. Falcao's was caused by another player in a match.

A lot of how footballers recover depends on the people around them. Falcao is taken care of by Jorge Mendes, who is known to take great care of his footballers. He even has a medical wing at his agency, Gestifute. Mendes spins money like Rumpelstiltskin and he would never do anything that would endanger one of his biggest money-making clients's long term future. Rest assured, Falcao is back for good. Oh btw, Bebe's agent is also Jorge Mendes. Connect the dots?

1226~~~
Except neither Negredo nor Soldado are FALCAO! They were never even considered to be among the top #9s of the world let alone the best #9.

1227~~~
I usually a fan of big signings coming of the bench for the huge applause they get in the second half. But considering our circumstances right now, RVP can come of the bench especially since he played in internationals this week as well. We need Falcao to start.

1228~~~
Damn you. I wish I hadn't read that <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>[/QUOTE]

I wouldn't read too much into that, his benefit is that he only needs one chance, not 3 or 4.

1229~~~
People will write just about anything to make us look stupid as of late.' Manchester United need spend on 4/5 world class players' turning into 'Manchester United have over spent/lost their identity'.   I got annoyed for a while mainly with the  complete ignorance with which they were writing.Another one is how many posts/articles have I seen lambasting us for supposedly buying three LB's in Shaw, Blind and Rojo.  The fact none of them actually even refer to the fact that the latter two play better elsewhere is either just a show of ignorance or choosing to ignore simple facts in order to make us look stupid. As for Falcao I feel he was bought because LVG is not happy with the Mata, Rooney/RVP combination and we are unlikely to see the three play together again unless Falcao has a bad run of form or gets injured. He will also stir up some much needed healthy competition between them up front where before they were likely to think their position in the first XI was set in stone. 

I've learnt to find it quite funny that everyone is putting so much effort into making us look like tossers. There's no way to win either. If we get back in to form and win the title next season for instance, it will be because we 'bought the league' and if we don't people will laugh that we wasted so much money to no avail. I'm actually really looking forward to the big games this season. I think we might surprise a few. It would be nice to have some bragging rights which we haven't really enjoyed ever since Fergie left.

1230~~~
Yep, we need to scare the shit out of these lot right from when the teamsheets are out.

1231~~~
Using that logic, we would continue with Young, Fletcher and Valencia in a 352, purely because we have seen them play together. 

Also, that post, made 19 pages ago, was not about the QPR game but was merely to generally show a balanced formation in which each of our best players can play in their best position. 

Obviously we cannot know for sure what our best team will be, but then we don't know how well the new players will integrate with the old ones in general.

1232~~~
That's Falcao's problem, scores too many penos....

1235~~~
No ambition? He just joined Manchester United. You are breathtakingly well named.

1236~~~
The whole lying about his age thing surfaced some time ago and was then denied.

1237~~~
Where there is no CL, no Europa and no chance of a PL title. But there's money. Huge pots of money. Honey.

1238~~~
It's still Manchester United. One season without Europe. Since the ban on English clubs was lifted (1990–1991) United have been in Europe every season bar this one. One season in 24 years! You honestly think we won't be back? Or that Falcao won't do his part to help us get back? Players who join huge clubs don't do so if they lack ambition. It's kind of the definition of being ambitious.

But by responding I'm feeding a particularly envious troll aren't I?

1239~~~
LOL

If only we had CL football. The big names like Lallana would have looked our way. 

Falcao and most of the world know that last year was an anomaly. Liverpool fans are, understandably, in denial.

1240~~~
Didn't you enquire about Falcao? Well according to Ben Smith of the BBC you did. I think he said you were told "no chance".

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1241~~~
Falcao has something legendary about him, his hair, name, goals vs top teams.

1242~~~
My 5 year old also likes to sometimes say ridiculous things and act silly when he wants unnecessary attention.

We ignore it.

1243~~~
I'm sorry but the team you suggested is horribly imbalanced and just looks like a muppet formation to fit players in, rather than a formation that gets the best out of the team.

1244~~~
I think he's going to be great for this. Can see him banging them in against the Top 4.

1245~~~
1000% correct. Instead at 28, nearly 29, he went to a team that could actually pay him obscene Rooneyesque money. Europe or no Europe. Halamadrid didn't work so Utd it was.

Denial works both ways.

1246~~~
Genuinely gutted we can afford to pay for the top players. Watching Lallana, Lambert and Balotelli slip through our fingers hurt a lot. fecking Moyes making sure we weren't in the Champions League.

1247~~~
I agree with you as you agree with me then.

1248~~~
Don't get too worked up about it. Yes we can still sign world class players over you, even without European football. Thats just the way it is. Embrace it.

1249~~~
Exactly this. Some would prefer Di Maria and Falcao, but Can, Lambert, Lallana, Markovic, Ballotelli are what you want. Slot those in amongst Allen, Gerrard and Henderson, and my word do you have some quality. Droolworthy.

1250~~~
You do realise the only reason you signed who you signed this year is because you offered them more money than someone else did.

Same concept, it's just that our dick is much bigger than yours.

1251~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
You are really well informed aren't you?

1252~~~
Please do explain...

1253~~~
Liverpool fans wanted him more than anything, there is so much envy from them (just watch Tommos interview). Before the summer, many of them were saying doesn't matter how much money you have got, you can't attract the best. One Di Maria and Falcao later and all of a sudden it's just because we have a load of money. 

But hey, they got Ricky Lambert... Sit back and repeat... Ricky Lambert.

1254~~~
To be fair, he's not likely to embrace it, but boy is he working hard to ignore it. He probably wakes in the wee small hours with the words "Radamel Falcao is a United player" echoing in his head before he reaches for the Xanax! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1255~~~
Ribery joined Bayern in a season when they had no CL. Ronaldinho joined Barca when they were in the same situation. Us, Real, Barca and Bayern are the four most prestigious teams in the world. Players will be willing to join us even if we are going through a bit of a transition because of who we are. On the other hand a team like Liverpool have struggled to attract top players despite the fact they have CL football the offer. In a straight choice between us and Liverpool, even when ye can offer CL football, we are more attractive. The reason for this is because coming in the top 4 isn't the norm for you lot. Players are wary of this. They won't be willing to join a club for the sake of one season of CL football if there is a decent chance they could go a number of subsequent years without it. It's the same reason Everton and Spurs couldn't attract top players when they came in the top 4. 

In the long run we are a safe bet in terms of future success. Us coming outside the top 4 was as much of a surprise as Liverpool getting in the top 4 was. There is a reason why bookies had us as the 3rd favourites for the title before the start of the season. There is a reason why Samir Nasri named us and Chelsea as City's main rivals for the league this season despite us getting off to a poor start. Coming 7th for one season doesn't make us a mid-table team although people will have you think otherwise. Liverpool were a mid-table team as they consistently came outside the top 6. We have only done that once in the history of the PL. We don't release books celebrating 2nd place because we are used to winning things. It is this that attracts the likes of Falcao. It's a rule of thumb that if you join Manchester United you win things. That's what attracts the top players. One poor season will not put them off. Same goes for Barcelona, Real and Bayern. We've only gone one season without winning the league not 24.

1256~~~
Good post. No need to keep feeding the bitter troll, though. Envy, eh. I swear, I would rather Lallana / Balotelli than Di Maria / Falcao. Righteo.

1257~~~
I'd have given all four up for Rickie Lambert.

1258~~~
It's impossible to tell with Liverpool fans whether they are being serious or not. Bear in mind this is the set of supporters who think they have a chance of winning the league at the start of every season despite the fact they have not won it for ages and generally struggle to get in the top 4. Without doubt the most delusional fans on the planet.

1259~~~
Sterling, Lallana, Lovren and Henderson would improve our team though. Sterling & Lallana replacing Young/Valencia, Lovren replacing Jones/Evans/Smalling, Henderson replacing Fletcher/Anderson.

Sadly, such world-class players of this quality wouldn't be available in the next transfer window because Liverpool already bought them.

All we're left with would be possible transfers with overpriced and old defenders and midfielders who no one rates. You know, players like Falcao and Di Maria who should be in retirement homes. Or those who don't even deserve to play a single match, players of so low class like Herrera and Rojo.

1260~~~
No width whatsover, and if Di Maria/Herrera do push out wide, it leaves Blind in the middle on him self.. Teams will walk through our midfield if we try to go wide, and destroy us on the wings if they tuck inside. It's 433-4231 or nothing.

1261~~~
I love how when Liverpool sign "World Class" talents they are utter cnuts such as Suarez amd Balotelli yet the ones we sign are always very humble like RVP, Mata, Di Maria and Falcao. I know what I prefer

1262~~~
We signed a few "World-Class" cnuts ourselves too.

1263~~~
Smart and sensible outlook lad! Totally agree.

1264~~~
RVP is a cnut/prick first class.

1265~~~
What you are effectively saying is that the 41212 diamond does not work, yet multiple teams have shown it can, including Liverpool and Chelsea in the past.

You are right, either Herrera OR Di Maria can go out wide and the other can remain back. They both have the engine, work rate and talent to do this. On paper, City have no width with Silva and Nasri, but they do well. Arsenal play Ozil on the wing.

It sure as hell would be better than the 352 we have at the minute and we do not have the wide players to play a 4231 or a 433. Di Maria's best position is at CM, so by putting him on the wing, we are limiting his impact. He was a very good winger, but a world class CM.

We also have 3 top class strikers, so I cannot see LVG playing with only one striker, so at least this formation is realistic. It is a 433, of sorts, and any formation can work with the right players. We have the right players for a 41212.

If you actually look at the players we have, it makes a lot of sense.

1266~~~
Why exactly?

1267~~~
I'm not saying it doesn't work. But teams that have successfully used it have been very unique and 'complete' so to speak. And you're wrong in saying we have the right players for a 4-1-2-1-2, it's just the easiest formation to fit all of our 'star' players in which makes people automatically assume it's the best.

Di Maria is first and foremost a winger, he had a brilliant season as CM for Madrid that's right, but that's for Madrid with wide players such as Ronaldo/Bale, CM's such as Khedira/Alonso/Modric and an all around striker in Benzema. He will be ineffective for us in such a role, we lack the squad quality of Madrid. 4-3-3 will work for us much more than 4-1-2-1-2, you need to think of rotation, injurys and form, you really think all of our players will be fit all season to allow us to play a 4-1-2-1-2 in the first place? As soon as 2-3 of them are gone the 4-1-2-1-2 becomes IMPOSSIBLE to play. Also our front men are primarily lone strikers, I can't see any of them being able to work in front two for us. 

4-3-3



                                     De Gea

Rafael/Valencia              -     Jones/Evans          -     Rojo/Smalling           -  Shaw/Rojo

                             Blind/Carrick/Fletcher

        Herrera/Carrick/Fletcher   -   Mata/Rooney/Di Maria

Di Maria/Young                 - Falcao/RvP -                 Januzaj/Young

1268~~~
You do realise that the only difference between a 3-5-2 and a 4-1-2-1-2 Diamond is that we have a very deep CDM instead of an extra CB? The full backs in such a system are still expected to essentially act as wing backs, providing the majority of the width while the CDM( Blind or Carrick) will basically just act as an advanced CB. LVG will probably play the 4-1-2-1-2 and refer to it as a 3-5-2 in the same way he refers to a 4-2-3-1 as a 4-3-3. It's just a more attacking variant of the 3-5-2 due to the extra midfielder who in a diamond is really more of a midfielder/defender hybrid and is the man who while bring the ball out of the defense more often than not.

Also Di Maria will play in a 4-1-2-1-2 will play in almost the exact same kind of role as he did in Madrid, as a winger/midfielder hybird. He's very effective there and it is hands down his best position as long as he has two midfielders capable of covering the space he has left behind, which we now have. As others have said he could be an amazing winger but was incredibly inconsistent there and somewhat frustrating. We need more squad depth in the winger positions to make a 4-3-3 possible anyway and as of now we only have Di Maria, Januzaj and Wilson who are really capable of doing a job there. Arguably Mata and Rooney can fit in on either wing but I don't think it will work and would be a massive waste of both of their talent. Young/Valencia shouldn't ever play there again- it would be like having 1 winger.

Can you also tell me my future? You seem to know everything

1269~~~
Great post and for this reason you will likely not get a response from your guy there, he loves Falcao and his brain is hurting.

1270~~~
I didn't like him when he was at Arsenal at all, he is a vicious player when he wants to be.

Very good post beforehand by the way, not sure how you can argue against it.

1271~~~
Cheers! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>


I guess he has a bit of a nasty streak but so did Keane and he was my favourite United player when he was at the club so it doesn't really bother me. At long as he isn't a cnut 24/7 like Suarez I'll forgive him for the odd indiscretion. RVP was always one of my favourite non-United players when he was at Arsenal, and I obviously admire him even more now. I guess from my point of view his role in winning the 20th league title means he can do no wrong at this stage.

Cheers mate! I'm sure he'll give it a try. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1272~~~
Scousers definitely didn't want him at all. Nope. No way.

This is a very, very good post. Well done.

1274~~~
I can't believe we sold Danny superstar Welbeck and replaced him with this clown.. some right whoopers out there.

1275~~~
Yup. Awful decision by the club. I wonder if he can do it on a rainy night at Stoke.. I think not..

Aye, LVG is a clueless git. Replacing our 4th choice striker with a player that's scored 191 goals in 292 appearances. Shame on him!

1277~~~
Can't wait for Sunday for this guy to show all these Welbeck muppets what a world class striker actually looks like.

1278~~~
Cheers mate! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1279~~~
It's not about that. Its that we sold a young home town player who is totally different to any of the strikers we have now. At only 23 he could flourish to become a top striker if given the chance, unfortunately for us he will have that chance at Arsenal now.

1280~~~
He wouldn't have the chance to flourish being fourth choice though.

1281~~~
He should have sold Rvp or Rooney rather then Welbeck.

No one is questioning the signing of Falcao. Its more who he's replaced.

1282~~~
Wilson looks a cracking talent, I hope he does well. Welbeck is an Arsenal player now and before those two standard England goals, everybody across the globe could see that we got the far better deal.

1283~~~
Wilson might be great, who knows. Hope so though.

As for the better deal, I think Arsenal have got a cracker. The best deal would have been to sign Falcao, keep Welbeck, and flog one of RVP/Rooney.

1284~~~
So you would rather sell two players who regularly get over 25 goals a season and keep Welbeck who has only hit double figures twice in his entire career?

1285~~~
I'd choose your words carefully there. We're only three games in ffs.

1286~~~
Its about buliding a team with balance, not all three of them can hit 25 + in a season, in the same team. Welbeck offers something that none of those other three do.

1287~~~
I agree with pretty much everything <a class="username" data-user="84845, @santeria13" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84845/">@santeria13</a> said.

Di Maria definitely is not first and foremost a winger. As I said, Di Maria is a very good yet inconsistent winger, and is a world class CM. His work ethic of getting back and pushing on is perfect and is exactly what we need. We lack penetration and someone to carry the ball from midfield and he can add that in abundance. Not playing him at CM will waste a lot of his talent and it was the reason why we bought him (see vs. Burnley). 

You mention injuries, but you forget that the team I posted was our best team. It would be impossible to put the team accounting for injuries, as that obviously changes. Formations also can change to adapt to the team and there is little difference between the various formations. 

If you look at what LVG has done so far, my team/formation is a lot more realistic than yours. Unless RVP does get injured or Rooney is moved to MF permanently, we will play with two strikers. If we were to buy Reus next year, I would advocate a 433, but I would still play Di Maria at CM. 

By the way, Rooney has pretty much always been a second striker of some sort. He and Falcao/RVP would make a good top two.

1288~~~
People are not complaining about the fact we have Falcao though.

1289~~~
No, they are complaining because we've sold an average striker with a shocking goal to game ratio all because he is a "local lad". The lad will score goals at Arsenal but the meltdown by the masses is embarrassing.

1290~~~
Bergkamp <i>only </i>scored 87 in 315 Arsenal appearences. I guess he was average too.

1291~~~
But a very good goal to minute ratio.

1292~~~
Wilson can offer the same thing as Welbeck did. According to reports last week the reason Welbeck left was because he was told Wilson was ahead of him in the pecking order. He has more potential than Welbeck ever did so that's a good call by LVG if it's true.

1293~~~
Or because he is a very talented player who will offer Arsenal a lot more than just goals. I'm sure a lot of players would struggle with their 'goal to game ratio' had they played wide a lot and had strikers like Rooney, RVP and an early Hernandez in their way.

It's not just because he is a local lad. He is a local lad who is very talented and gave 100% every game. SAF would say the exact same thing. How many strikers make it through the academy into the first team here?

1294~~~
I'm not even going to entertain responding to such a stupid comment. Comparing Danny Welbeck to one of the greatest second strikers the game has ever seen.. Blimey.

1295~~~
I haven't the numbers but not many.. and Welbeck is another one of those who under current management (whose judgement I trust a bit more than yours, no offence) he was surplus to requirements so that tells me LVG either doesn't rate him as highly and clearly thinks we now have 4 better strikers on our books.

1296~~~
Rooney, RVP and Falcao <i>are</i> better than Welbeck. In two or three years time though, I'm not so sure. How old were Falcao and RVP when they turned it on for real?

1297~~~
Welbeck wanted to go though, he wanted the main striker role, but never had a chance of getting it at United, and rightly so, this is the only position he wanted to play, and wasn't happy on the bench, what could we do? 

Firmly believe if he had been content to be a squad player that he'd still be here, rightly , or wrongly.

1298~~~
In two/three years time James Wilson will be a first team regular, I am sure of it.. not to mention I'm sure we'd have replaced the ageing RVP as well so I'm still not going to lose any sleep over the loss of Danny.

1299~~~
But he has an average scoring record. Which is the <i>exact </i>stick you've just used to beat Welbeck with.

Can't have it both ways.

1300~~~
I believe in Wilson as well. That doesn't change anything in terms of Welbeck growing as a player.

1301~~~
But he should have had a chance to be one of the two main strikers LVG seems to want us to deploy this season. He was certainly our best striker in pre-season.

1302~~~
Maybe he wants to give the chance to Wilson instead. Do you have a problem with that?

1303~~~
I think people on here are getting way ahead of themselves with the Wilson hype. I doubt he'll get more then a subs role, and lots of reserve football this season.

1304~~~
I can though. Danny Welbeck wants to be outright front man. Dennis Bergkamp players alongside Thierry Henry in the "little and large" type combo. Danny, a talented player isn't going to be a world beater. Some thing he will be, I don't think he will be.

Danny will continue to grow as a player, as he will score goals for Arsenal but I still don't think he'll ever be in the class bracket of Van Persie, Falcao, Lewandowski, Suarez etc

1305~~~
We're playing with two strikers this season. He could easily have been a part of that.

In fact, I'd wager that any partnsership we could have had with Welbeck (i.e Rooney/Welbeck Falcao/Welbeck RVP/Welbeck) would be better then any partnserhip the other 3 will be able to put together. The other three are all to similar. Welbeck gave us something that the others don't have.

1306~~~
That's quite an ironic comment. Plus, if reports are to believed, LVG told Welbeck that he'd be behind him in the pecking order. I trust him in making that call if true. Pity not many other United fans do, they're just jizzing over an Arsenal player that didn't do the business at United.

1307~~~
LvG obviously saw things differently, obviously just didn't rate him that highly, this is a world class manager who knows what he's looking at so i fully trust that.

Plus I reckon we'll soon go 4-3-3, so maybe no long term future is the two up front, RvP, and Falcao rotating, with Rooney dropping back now, Wilson as the surprise/impact player?

1308~~~
He will become a player that will get 20 goals and 10 assists a season at least though, especially if he plays every week.

1309~~~
Rooney alongside either RVP/Falcao will be the way we go.. Rooney to do all the dirty work with either of the other two being the guys who do the business in the penalty box.. all of which they will do better than Welbeck.

1310~~~
He may do being the main man but we will also have players reaching that feet..

1311~~~
+ The type of forward he is, the likes of Walcott and Ramsey will score more as well. He brings out good play in others. That's why he doesn't have to be Falcao or Lewandowski good. He will be a top forward.

1312~~~
Why's it ironic?

We've seen Welbeck as a PL and International player for the past 4/5 years. More then enough to form an opinion. Wilson's rating is basically on the basis of his reserve performances, and I doubt half the people who claim to rate him so highly have ever seen anything more then some highlights of his goals. Plus, rating a reserve player so highly is risky business, how many of us though that the likes of Petrucci, Macheda, Gibson and Morrison were going to go on to be absolute stars for us?

1313~~~
Rooney/RVP hasn't worked for two years now as a partnership. And Falcao is a similar player.

As for doing all the dirty work, there is no one better at that then Welbeck.

1314~~~
But we also have players who'll chip in with goals. I honestly think other than Danny being a local lad, some seem to think with the loss of Danny our goals will some reason dry up. We'll have Rooney, RVP, Falcao, Di Maria all chipping in this season so the loss of Danny's 4 goals a season won't be missed terribly.

1315~~~
It has worked in spells. I actually think we'll see RVP/Falcao as a partnership with either Rooney behind them or actually even further behind with James Wilson who is a much better finisher already as the backup. I am really not fussed with the loss of Danny.

1316~~~
For the sake of it, I'm going to say that Wilson has scored more PL goals last season than Welbeck did in 12/13 in 27 appearances. I'm joking of course, but I don't that he's as far down in LVG's thoughts as you seem to be claiming him to be. A manager that's famous for making stars of promising youth.

1317~~~
You've missed my point. In two or three seasons time when our forward start to slow down, Welbeck would have been a very good option. I'm not talking about right now.

1318~~~
To be fair, James scored like, a third of Danny's goals in one game last season.

1319~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> unbelievable the bullshit 
sentimentality in here. 80% of the time Welbeck has been gash for us. He's gone now, move on. 
We now have Falcao, Rooney and Van Persie as our strike force. Incredible

1320~~~
I know what you mean but even then I honestly believe Danny would be behind James Wilson so he'd still be unhappy or would have moved on.

1321~~~
We usually play with two strikers though?

I don't really want to go on with this as it is clear we do not agree with each other.

1322~~~
That sounds horrible. No pace, no creativity, no linkup.

1323~~~
I'd much prefer sell RVP than Rooney. Rooney is three years younger, not injury prone and can possibly drop into midfield when his legs start to go. He has plenty still to offer. RVP has two more years max left in him at this level

1324~~~
Ffs. Get back in the sea will you.

1325~~~
That much is obvious.

Angel di Maria.. there is your pace for now, not quite sure how you can claim there will be no creativity among Rooney, RVP and Falcao.

1326~~~
Struck a nerve sir?

1327~~~
The thing with both RVP and Falcao is that both are incredibly good at converting chances. If you watch the video of RVP's first season with us the vast majority of goals actually came from crosses. Falcao's goals are a bit more varied, but also rely on service. 

I'm really worried we're not addressing the main issue - we don't create chances any more. And having 2 world class finishers isn't going to solve that. 

I'd wager a good deal of money Costa will handily outscore Falcao. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Welbeck gets more this season.

1328~~~
We've bought in three midfielders though?

1329~~~
Because none of them consistently create chances?

As for Di Maria, he's gonna have a hell of a lot on his shoulders to create everything for us. Thats why I think Mata has to play if we are to make a front 3 work.

1330~~~
Sorry, yes I agree. I mean Falcao isn't the answer to our problem. Or rather upgrading one of strikers isn't the answer. 

Think he'll end up being a waste of money, unfortunately, and will leave us needing a new striker in 1 or 2 seasons when RVP and he both leave.

1331~~~
Did you not watch tonights game, Rooney created several chances.. also Di Maria and Mata in the same team would create a lot but properly leave us with 1 up top.

1332~~~
Rooney played quite well today, but he doesnt do it enough on a regular basis for United.

I reckon something like this could work...

------Falcao------Rooney/RVP
------------Mata-------------

----Di Maria-------Herrera------
-------------Blind---------------

1333~~~
If we have a consistent midfield and defence, our forwards will score for fun. Falcao, Rooney, RVP, whoever.

1334~~~
You end with that statement after making predictions your self <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Hillarious. Yeah, Di Maria was so frustrating against Germany. 3-5-2 doesn't work, 4-1-2-1-2 won't work. Narrow formations with two at the top are terrible, so congested and without any quality wide men we will continue to be frustrated.

1335~~~
Not if they are consistently shit

1336~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Well, I believe we have the right balance and quality with di Maria, Herrera and Blind.

1337~~~
I'm making my predictions based on things that I have seen. You are stating that certain things will not work without ever seeing them happen. Also Di Maria is hands down more effective in CM than on the Wing. He would probably admit so himself. One friendly match against a weakened Germany in which Durm was playing on Di Maria's flank is nothing to go by at all. As I said in my OP, he might have a world class game as a winger but he also tends to be inconsistent there, something which is not apparent when he plays as a CM, where he has been consistently world class.

I though pre-season would have taught you not to take friendlies seriously? Also going by your logic, then the 3-5-2 is also a great system since we we beat the Champions league holders 3-1 using that formation. ----Same logic you used to describe Di Marias performance as a winger vs Germany to prove my original statement wrong. Weakened team, <b>one</b> game, friendly etc...

1338~~~
We bought probably the best creator of chances in the world in Di Maria. He's also not a #10 type player like Mata or Ozil who need runners and good service and space to pick off teams, he can create things on his own and create for others because of his pace and skill on the ball. Genuinely don't think there was a better player we could have bought to make our attack click, even if we could choose anyone in the world.

1339~~~
Dont think anyone can really argue with vanP being dropped,or 3-5-2 being scrapped now we have the resources to switch.

Big fish,bigger pond.


I still cant believe we ve signed Falcao.

1340~~~
There isn't. RVP , Rooney nor Falcao are creative players. They're goal scorers.

1341~~~
His inconsistencies are also really overrated though. He wasn't like Nani where he'd go from brilliant to complete dog shit and you genuinely didn't know which one would show up. He had brilliant games, a few poor ones and average ones. Was still one of the best wingers around at creating chances consistently.

1342~~~
Herrera will be a class act in the centre of midfield, wait til you see. Blind will be a nice link between defence and midfield but I'm not sure he'll bring as much quality as Herrera. I can see Herrera playing lovely passes like Fabregas did for Schurrle the other week once he settles in, with Falcao getting on the end of them <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1343~~~
I think this is the problem. Everyone is saying our midfield is shit yet we still havent had a proper look at Blind, Herrera and Di Maria. Once those three come into the team our midfield completely changes and we will be in a better position to know just how good we are.

This is the midfield we need to control a game and create chances for the likes of falcao

1344~~~
I would post an argument in this thread, but I think this is as good a summary of the issue a there could be.

1345~~~
Well Herrera played the second most through balls in La Liga? And Di Maria had the most assists. If those two are not adding creation to the team we are doomed.

I feel some United fans dont even know the team we have anymore. The injuries need to go away now.

1346~~~
And didn't Ozil have the most assists before he left real as well... But as soon as it got a bit cold over here he seemed to not fancy it last year.
Herrera and Di Maria have all the tools to be a success here - but so did Veron.
I remain optimistic but I do believe it will still take time for it to click and just hope we can be close enough to the cl spots when it does click that we can finish in the top four

1347~~~
It get's pretty cold in Madrid too over the winter. I think it's more down to getting used to the style of play.

1348~~~
You can't really compare Özil. He is known for being brilliant when the surroundings are easy for him (good weather, easy team, little pressure) but is known as a fair-weather player as he doesn't play well when the going gets tough.

It will take time to click, but I am more confident in Di Maria and Herrera than I would have been for Özil/Veron, as the former works harder than almost any other player and the latter seems pretty much made for English football.

1349~~~
Is this fella cleared to play for us now? Work permit sorted and everything?

1350~~~
What you said doesnt have anything to do with what I said or commented on though does it?. The guy I quoted said we ignored the chance creation part of the team. I pointed out that we have brought 2 of the best from Spain in to the team.

1351~~~
Bet he'll be injured in one of his first appearances and stay that way for several months. Will never return ti be the player he was and slowly decay into nothingness...

1352~~~
That's the spirit!

1353~~~
Really hope not but given our luck with injuries..

But then again we don't need to buy him after the season, as we supposedly have an option to buy him and nothing else after the loan is done.

1354~~~
Think he is still awaiting clearance on the Visa thing. Work Permit shouldn't be a issue.

Shouldn't take as much time as Rojo anyway.

1355~~~
Perfect.

Is Falcao ready to play for United, I mean does he have to get a work permit or anything? Can't wait to see him unleashed

1356~~~
Are you Danny Welbeck by any chance?

1357~~~
I'm Wanny Delbeck<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1358~~~
There's being a competitive player who goes in hard, and biting people, stamping on people, racism etc.
can't really argue they're anywhere near the same ball park.

1359~~~
Great stuff. Keep it up!

1360~~~
Guys watch RVP tonight and tell me that we didnt need Falcao.

1361~~~
Exactly. This is the reason the likes of him and Cleverley lasted so long at the club.

1362~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1363~~~
Exactly, it's a shame, because I really liked Welbeck. But always knew he wouldn't be as big as first thought. He will do good at arsenal though.

1364~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hc9miLT8ew?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Because if it's stuck in my head, it should be in yours too.

1365~~~
Why are people here talking as if we wanted to kick Welbeck out of the club? Wasn't he the one who wanted out?

1366~~~
He was told he was fifth choice striker, that he would struggle for game time, and that he could leave if he wanted to. Of course he "wanted out," he was given no other alternative.

1367~~~
And you have proof of this?

1368~~~
Fairly content with the manner of James Ducker's reporting this week to know he's been sourced well. The article was in the Times. It's also been reported by a number of creditable journalists that we were willing to let him leave, that we couldn't give him the game time he wanted. We've also been actively searching for another striker for the best part of 12 months now, hence the signing of Falcao.

We may not have "kicked him out of the club" but he was left with no real future at the club, that much is fairly obvious.

1369~~~
It's been in my head since last week. I'd love to hear it belted out on Sunday.

1370~~~
Oh James Ducker said so. Instead of following a yahoo, why don't you think back to Jan/Feb when this story first broke out about him wanting out? And going by your logic, was Welbeck a 5th choice striker then? Why did he want out? And left with no real future? WOW! He made 36 appearances in all competitions for us last season and 40 appearances the year before. Is that us telling a player he has no future with us? Also we haven't been "actively" searching for a striker for 12 months. We had 4 with Wilson coming along well. We were "linked" to a few especially with Cavani the most but thats all paper talk.

1371~~~
And whats better than listening to a song that lasts 50 seconds? Well listening to it for a full 4 minutes on loop.
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wsi4rjfpwdc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1372~~~
There is proof. In his last presser before deadline day, when he was asked who could be leaving, LVG said that it was up to the players to decide if they wanted to leave. Going by that, logic dictates that Danny asked to leave. This also coincided with Wilson's promotion to first team training. Connect the dots.

1373~~~
Or that Welbeck was the one who said he wanted to leave, so LVG obliged and we didn't want to keep him against his wishes? We don't know what happened behind the scenes. Do you honestly think that people like Giggs and the rest associated with the club would have left Welbeck just walk out of here with no reason? LVG might be mad sometimes but he isn't daft to understand how important youth team players are for a club. We shouldnt doubt him of all people for this.

1374~~~
I can see that being sung for a full half of an away match. It will be epic!
(But it's killing me at the moment)

1375~~~
I'll start with this "paper talk" lark, as you strike me as one of these "the papers know feck all" lads. There is a lot more to it than that. You can discard creditable journalists that are sourced by Ed Woodward directly all you like, but that would be more fool you. Daniel Taylor, the closest man to Woodward at any of the broadsheets, has been rabbiting on about our admitted need for a striker with "dynamism" for months now. He even recently detailed how we met with the agent of Cavani immediately after the new year and that the player himself was open to the idea of moving. This isn't some junior at a tabloid being forced to make up stories, it's one of the best sourced football journalists in the country, one who used to work the Manchester beat. Welbeck or no Welbeck, Falcao, or another, has been in the pipeline for a while.

Then there's initial reports of Welbeck wanting to leave earlier in the season. Welbeck has a talkative camp, I reckon that's obvious. It was clearly true. He clearly didn't have a working relationship with Moyes and was thinking of moving for the benefit of his career. Fair one, no? Moyes is replaced, Van Gaal is appointed and he immediately tells the media he is excited for the season ahead. With a few days of the transfer window to go, mass reports from creditable journos indicate that he's been told he can leave, that his game time will be limited, that we don't want to sell him to a top six club, and Ducker himself went on to state that James Wilson's progress was a major influence behind the manager's thinking. Hence 5th choice. Clearly the situation changed for Welbeck throughout the summer, as we added more players to the squad.

He could have stayed in the squad I'm sure, but it will have been a wasted season, one where he finds himself behind all of Rooney, Van Persie, Falcao and now Wilson, not to mention we have the likes of Mata, Januzaj and Di Maria fighting for places, too. In the end, to leave the club was a mutual parting of ways, probably best for all parties given the circumstances, but people would be foolish to pretend as if Welbeck decided he'd push for a move for no reason with only a day left of the transfer window for the pure hell of it. I've written far too much here but hey ho.

1376~~~
Also thats not proof. You putting two things together is proof? When you don't know whats goes on in the club, you can't assume things.

1377~~~
RADAMEL FFAALLCCAAOO! LO LO LO LLLOOO!

I'll have to take a scarf on Sunday.
I'll be the one fecker in the SAF tier2 doing it. lol lolooloollo RADAMEEEEL FALCAAO!!!!!!

My first time listening to that...it's just infectious.

Don't know how it will go in an English accent. It suits to Spanish, time will tell.

1381~~~
I hope he's good because it would be a shame not to hear that song for bordering 90 minutes every week.

1382~~~
Yeah, cracking!! I would love to hear it being chanted in the faces of the City, Liverpool etc runts!! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1383~~~
Most reports said he was 3rd behind RvP & Rooney... who would he be 5th behind when Chicharito was already going out on loan? At worst he'd be 4th (behind falcao, rvp, rooney). There have been no signs to say Wilson was ahead of him.

1384~~~
Falcao and Wilson. As I've stated, James Ducker has put his name to this and did so with authority. If people want to live in some daft cloud whereby Welbeck just randomly decided to piss off with one day of the window to go then they can set themselves away. If Welbeck was third choice striker at the club he'd still be here.

1385~~~
i didnt think he was 3rd but 4th..I also think he'd still "piss off" as he wanted to be a starter either way. But no I dont think he was 5th and I dont really care that it was Ducker - he and others have been wrong before. Iv'e based it on teh fact that even days before he left Welbeck was played over Wilson.

1386~~~
It's obviously not telling a player he has no future with us. But looking at his future, how many of those appearances were starts? And how many of them were upfront, which is what he needs in order to develop as a striker?

I'm sure we wanted him to stay, but we couldn't do that and also give him what he needed in order to improve. Van Gaal pretty much said he'll give the fringe players his idea of their position in the squad and will allow them to make up their own minds.

1387~~~
fecking hell. I'm as annoyed at Welbeck leaving as the next caftard but does have to be discussed in every fecking thread on redcafe?

1388~~~
No.

<b>Anymore Welbeck talk in here will be deleted and warning points given out. Take it to his own thread. </b>

The same applies to suggestions that we asked him to go. My objective has been achieved. I'll get my coat.

His 50 headed goals for River Plate, Porto and Athletico. Man he must have some neck muscles to score some of these goals. Also I feel like he is similar to Vidic in the sense that he isn't afraid to put his head where other players wouldnt.

wow...

1412~~~
Can you believe RADAMEL FALCAO plays for us? Ignore all the guff about him being here for the money (the vast majority of players are hired guns these days) and United losing sight of its core values, we've signed one of the world's deadliest strikers. It's absolutely surreal.

1413~~~
Ah bless, the scousers are absolutely livid we've got this one bagged. Trying to convince theirselves he's not worth it or he's not that good. Apparently being second choice to Madrid is meant to hurt. Errr nah.... I'm okay with being second best to the best club in Europe now.  Anyway, you can tell genuinely how happy he is to be here. Man United is just as big a club as Madrid and I think he knows that, it was just his preference to go to Real seeing as he's a South American and probably grew up with them.

The scousers do make me laugh with their bitterness though. It's so obvious as well. Fact is, if he went to any other club on Earth, they'd be saying he's worth every penny.

1414~~~
At least, they didn't misspell "Mata", or did they <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1415~~~
Radamellll Facaaoooo. It's stuck in my head too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1416~~~
Maybe you would have more luck at the United store<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1417~~~
Di Maria and Falcao are going to link up beautifully I think. 

I can see many goals made by those 2.

1418~~~
That's where he works (printing the names and numbers)

1419~~~
How hard could be to put 6 letters in order. And from United store of all the places.. My god..

1420~~~
Only one fan gets the shirt with wrong name on it. Right. 
Seems like a teenager joke.

1421~~~
Falcao is a Manchester united plater - getthafukouttaheeee!!!!<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1422~~~
What's the use of going online with that? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

He could just have returned it quietly.

1423~~~
It's still not sunk in that we've potentially signed the best striker on the planet.

I really hope he's still the same player because we're fecked otherwise.

1424~~~
we had Ruud play for us and he was absolutely deadly. As was Denis Law. And we currently have Robin Van Persie who was bought after his best season, at his absolute peak. And we also have a certain Wayne Rooney, who was one the best strikers in the world, and in his best season, he was the best striker in the world (of course assuming Ronaldo & Messi aren't strikers) ( I am saying this as someone who would have been happy if we sold him last summer).It is not all that unbelievable that one of the top strikers has signed for us. I think the Van Persie signing was more sensation in terms of signing a top striker, since we signed him from Arsenal.

1425~~~
I think this kind of aerial ability is something we've missed up top for a while now. Rooney is good, but when he plays in that withdrawn role he isn't really that much of a threat. Van Persie, it's just not his game. So it will be nice to have a quality striker in the air as well as on the deck.

1426~~~
Yeah, I noticed that too, maybe he can somehow use some of that aimless Valencia crosses. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1427~~~
I dunno, I just always saw Falcao as the sort of player that would end up at Real Madrid, City or Chelsea. It signals a definite shift in policy for United to land this sort of player.

1428~~~
I have watched Danny since he was a young lad, no doubting his talent. He has and will scored great goals but over those years he was never a great goal scorer. Wilson at his present level is a natural goal scorer and could become a great goal scorer in the Owen mould.
Danny has been unsettled for some time he wanted what Arsenal can offer a crack at being number 1. But what i would ask those who think this is a huge mistake would Arsenal have made that effort to sign him if Giroud had not got injured and is Giroud a striker you would like united to buy?

1429~~~
He reminds me a lot of Denis Law, but a modern version, brave powerful, deadly and even more spectacular. Hoping that he's back to his best after the injury. If so  I don't think there is a better striker in the current game

1430~~~
I have only seen Falcao in highlights but if he is close to Dennis the best in box striker i have ever seen then we are in for a treat.

1431~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1432~~~
I agree.

1433~~~
He'll have to dive low to head in some of Valencia's smashes across the area.
The ones that don't go into defenders shins.

1434~~~
Indeed. I was convinced he'd be at Real this season. It proves to everyone that we can get the very top quality, but obviously we've paid top whack for it but that is how football is at the top level.

1435~~~
I just can't stop singing this. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

What a brilliant, yet utterly simple chant.

1436~~~
Speaks very good English, which is always a bonus. Can't wait to see him in action on Sunday.

1437~~~
So it's not possible you're a bad judge of character?

1438~~~
Has he actually got his work permit / visa so that he can play this weekend?

1439~~~
LVG said so yeah.

1440~~~
Cool. Thanks.

1441~~~
Sthing like that. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

p.s. that Falcao song is catchy as hell, I can see myself singing it quietly tomorrow at work.

1442~~~
The goal at 0:17 is just too absurd.

1443~~~
Yes. It's all sorted. Van Gaal said he's available to play.

1444~~~
Came over really well in the presser, can't wait to see him play for us.

1445~~~
It's possible. But if you scroll back up the thread, there's a few other posters agreeing with me.

Fact is, this signing doesn't happen under SAF...

1446~~~

1447~~~
The greatest picture and caption in the history of the internet.

1448~~~
We have Falcao!! Still hasn't sunk in.

1449~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Cannot fecking wait to seem him in action. It's so crazy that he's a part of this club!

1450~~~
Juan Sebastian Veron.

1451~~~
I bet the noise will be phenomenal when his name gets announced.

1452~~~
He comes across as a very likeable and humble chap.

1453~~~
I know, we don't sign players of his calibre. We got him and Di Maria in the space of a couple of weeks. Beyond awesome

1454~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I still can't believe it, the muppet dream, gazing over Old Trafford. How did this happen?

1455~~~
Indeed, I dunno why but in his A.Madrid days I used to think that he was a cnut even though he never played dirty or gave me any reason. Must be the Colombian with long hair look or  something <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> .  Have a feeling he'll be a fan favorite, while on the subject actually think at least 5/6 of our new guys will be fan favorites, we got very lucky with personalities and the 'wanting to be at United' factor.

1456~~~
I want to mother his children.

1457~~~
Get in line!

1458~~~
He reminds me of the videos Ive seen of Gerd Muller. Even if the ball into the box isnt a good one he can still make something of it and if a defender loses concentration for a second he punishes it.

1459~~~
I can't believe he speaks English. I expected him to be one of those guys who just didn't give a shit about trying to integrate and all that.

But buzzwords/phrases like project, confidence and 'in this moment' will probably be his most commonly used terms in his time with us.

1460~~~
I have to ask, why ?

1461~~~
That was Van Persie in 2012-13. He made Evra and Valencia look like Beckham and Giggs.

1462~~~
I havent been this excited about a transfer since we got Rooney. Yes RVP, Mata and Di Maria were all exciting signings but when you have been following your favorite striker for 5 years now, for him to play for your club, its just surreal. 

Rooney
Falcao
RVP
Di Maria
Mata

1463~~~
Genuinely can't wait to see him play for us. 

While the international break has possibly been a life saver for us in terms of allowing our new signings to settle in a bit and getting other players back from injury, it's just been too long since we've played. I just want to see Falcao on the field. I want to see Falcao and Blind playing. I want to see Shaw play. I want to see Rojo play. We've not seen a full game from either Herrera or Di Maria. I want to see them play.  I want to see Rafael back and Carrick. I don't know when I've had this much anticipation for a game before. Let's hope we get the three points most importantly. But to get the three points in fairly emphatic fashion would be nice. It would be great to see our new signings playing well and maybe make other teams start to think about us and fear us again. It would be great for our defence to look solid too.

1464~~~
It sucks that I don't think he'll start this weekend. He'll only have had like 2 or 3 training sessions with the team, and then we also have all of our injured players back pretty much. What a lift it would be though to see him, di Maria, Herrera, blind, shaw and Rojo added in though. There's a chance they'll all start as we'll more likely a couple being subs though. Exciting times.

1465~~~
If all are fully fit I imagine Herrera, Blind, Di Maria and Shaw will start. Possibly Rojo. Simply because our defence and midfield need them. You could be right about seeing Falcao off the bench though.

1466~~~
He is fully fit though because he has started 3 games for Monaco already. Didn't ADM start as soon as we sign him? We need Falcao to start and score.

1467~~~
Gave me a boner that. 

Also nice for him to be playing in a proper football stadium again.

1468~~~
Yes but the difference is in Falcaos position we have Rooney and Rvp... We had nobody to put in for Di maria for the Burnley game other then shit players. He's fit I know, its just that with only 2 days of training I don't think he'll start him when Herrera, blind, Shaw, Di maria and rojo are all basically making debuts.

1469~~~
Damn, not seen this one. Who scores so many goals with his head? Unbelievable. If he's half as good as these video compilations show he'll be a God. He scores with left and right. He;s handsome as fk and so humble. I'm in love

1470~~~

LO LO LLLOOO!

1473~~~
Great insight from phil.

1474~~~
Imagine the noise when he comes on.

1475~~~
It's pretty much two weeks since we signed him and I still can't get my head around the fact that we're going to be watching Falcao wearing the no. 9 shirt for us this season and hopefully longer.

The signing nobody even expected but the one that could be the catalyst to LVG producing an amazing United side (with Di Maria too <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>).

1476~~~

1478~~~
Finally it will make sense to cross the ball in the box.

1479~~~
That reads like our recent set of results. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1480~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1481~~~
We have so many players to come in from the first 3 games it really will be a completely different affair.

If we hit any type of momentum, someone is going to take an absolute monstering.

1482~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1483~~~
Brilliant!

1484~~~
I genuinely believe he's here for the ££££...but I'm slowly warming to him so I'm happy to be proved stupidly wrong.

1485~~~
Rooney would be long gone if we hadnt offered him stupid money. What pleases me most about our signings is they seem to genuinley wanna come here despite the lack of CL football. I'd prefer their names to be Neville, Giggs, Scholes, Beckham, Butt etc but that' ll never happen again I guess. Still hope we' ll have atleast four british players in our starting lineup.

1486~~~
Well think of it like this. Madrid go for lots of top players but still pay top wages. It's not as though you get the best players going their for a wage cut or to play for free.

1487~~~
There is no doubt that money played the important role in getting him. We have to accept that but he can also want to be here at the same time for footballing reasons and this is still a great opportunity for him regardless of what he earns.

1488~~~
Good thing Manchester United have an option to buy him after this year.

1489~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

fecking fantastic.

1490~~~
Where can I see the full interview?

1491~~~
That's so fecking cheesy. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1492~~~
His introduction to the Premier League is only hours away and I couldn't be more excited. I hope he starts. But have a feeling we'll see him off the bench in the second half. Could take him a while to bed in, but he if could settle half as quickly as Costa he'll do OK.

1493~~~
I really hope he starts. The quicker we get him and di Maria on the same wavelength, the better.

1494~~~
Our captain too

1495~~~
To those who think he's just here for the money, it looks like he had genuine admiration for us, check out this tweet: <a class="externalLink" href="http://sulia.com/truered/f/3d6cc262-1f06-444e-bb9e-6a67a3cc2d7c/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sulia.com/truered/f/3d6cc262-1f06-444e-bb9e-6a67a3cc2d7c/</a>

Classy guy and he's not like Tevez at all, he's an intelligent well educated guy so the complete opposite.

1496~~~
For my fantasy team sake, I need him and Di Maria to explode tomorrow.

Here's hoping.

1497~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if Rio "feels something in his back" during the warmup just so he doesn't have to play against Di Maria and Falcao <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1498~~~
12 hours till he takes the pitch for us.

1499~~~
Desperate for Falcao to start and do well, having only VC'd Costa!
Big rival has Di Maria though, so if he can just assist the assisters <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1500~~~
Hmmm I think you may be disappointed, surely he will only be on the bench considering the little amount of football that he has played recently. ADM could be carrying your hopes!

1501~~~
Aren't we paying him the same as he earned at Monaco? He could've stayed there of money the only motivation.

1502~~~
Don't think he would be getting any more money than he was at Monaco here. Maybe even less net.

1503~~~
No one will care about that if he scores goals.

1504~~~
Theatre of muppet's wet dreams

1505~~~
Still can't quite believe he will be playing for us in a few hours <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1506~~~
What the feck happened there... Gave me headache trying to understand that.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1509~~~
Still think he wanted to go to real; and that he will leave next year if they want him. Come on, tweet about Ferguson, what does it prove? By this measure, one third of professional footballers are fans of Manchester.

<a class="username" data-user="88339, @FromTheBench" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/88339/">@FromTheBench</a> : Monaco's essentially broke.

5 hours 15 minutes lads!

1512~~~
Today is,

FALCAO DAY

1513~~~
Come on, he made his money in the 90's in Russia. Does this scream "earnest & hardworking" for you. And this murder storys where nobody knows if it was a complot or he just buyed himself out of charges. It was wild west our there.

1514~~~
He made his money with Pharmaceutical and Potash, but since he is russian he must be a gangster.

1515~~~
The Day of El Tigre.

1516~~~
He made billions of dollars in five years time out of absolutely & literally nothing, in a business environment known for proven blackmailing, fraud and murder. Yeah, I'm sure his west is as white as a fresh egyptian cotton blanket <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1517~~~
Sounds like a badass to me. Well, it was either him or someone else who would have made that money anyway.

1518~~~
I'm more excited about this debut than I was with Di Maria, and that is saying something. El Tigre getting to grace OT  in our red is just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1519~~~
Well he lost 2.6 billion pounds to his ex wife but he is worth 5.2 billion pounds so don't declare him broke yet. He still has <i>some</i> money and properties he could sell.

1520~~~
It still hasn't completely sinked in that we have this guy <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1521~~~
Our best eleven would have Shaw, jones, Rooney, with Evans, Smalling, Carrick, Fletcher, Young, Wilson being squad players. Think four Brits is realistic.

1522~~~
I think you need to look into Russian Billionaires and how they get to where they do.

1523~~~
Lovely tweet full of admiration and respect. You could tell he was pure class the minute you saw pics of him at the airport in a 3 piece suit.

1524~~~
I know exactly how they did and i also know how occidental billionaires did, it's the same world.

1525~~~
Well done. You've produced one example from a managerial career spanning 26 years.

1526~~~
You said this sort of signing "doesn't happen" under Sir Alex. Fact is it did. If you said it less definitively then your point stands. I'm only being an arse because you brought it back up again.

1527~~~

1528~~~
Never seen it from that angle. Insane.

1529~~~
Ferocious.

1530~~~
He loves them...

1538~~~
On the bench. Probably the right decision to ease him in.

1539~~~
Ya confirmed he is on the bench via the clubs twitter account.

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1542~~~
Should get one hell of a welcome when he comes on.

1543~~~
It's a variation of 442. LVG confirmed this.

1544~~~
If we do play this today, it will prove I am truly LVG.

1545~~~
Except you've not picked the same players and LVG is using this as a contingent due to lack of fit defenders but yeh <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

I feel he is capable of becoming as influential as Diego Costa for United, but with the players we have, I do not believe he will be as productive. I can not wait untill he gets his debut and hopefully, Van Gaal will understand how to get the best out of him.

1547~~~
Haha, I know but if it does well, maybe Louis will go ahead with it. Also, if everyone were at peak fitness it would probably have these players.

<a class="username" data-user="83668, @REJE" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83668/">@REJE</a>, still sure it is a muppet formation?

Rogers is Spanish for Rangers.

1554~~~
Fan favourite in a very short time! Love him! Got a feeling this is going to be the Cantona moment, not Van Persie. I'd put money on him being the catalyst to a resurgent United and a potential title/title challenge next season!

1555~~~
Yes I do. Mata behind RVP and Rooney doesn't work <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1556~~~
We'll see... That would make LVG a muppet too. I have the faith! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1557~~~
Oh Flacao <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1558~~~
Apparently he refused another club to join United. I wonder if that other club was Liverpool? I think they were in the champions league because it was a question in response to champions league football.

1559~~~
They started his chant. I heard it.

1560~~~
Erm....NO. It was Real Madrid.

1561~~~
Yeah, we're really really trying to get it going.

1562~~~
I laughed a lot.

Already love him to bits.

1564~~~
9/10 for his applause on the bench.

1565~~~
60 minutes and he'll come on and score a screamer!

1566~~~
He would have scored that chance if he chipped the keeper <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1567~~~
You are right, a diamond will never work.

1568~~~
Shame he got his chance as we blunted our right hand side and collectively stepped off the gas a bit, but he looked lively and his movement was good, give him a start in place of RvP next match and he'll do well.

1569~~~
I'd start him vs Leicester over RVP. It's a shame for him that the game hit a bit of a lull when he came on.

1570~~~
Yeah I'd start him over RVP. I think he'll benefit more from starting a game that doesn't have Valencia wasting chances on the right.

1571~~~
Start him over RvP.

1572~~~
It doesn't.. The front 3 in tandem TOGETHER were average, the threat came from Di Maria/Herrera/Mata/Rafael.. If Di Maria wasn't on form do you honestly think we could've relied on mata - rvp - rooney to score? We will see what you think when we come up against a team that moves out of their own half.

1573~~~
I was close to letting out a scream when he was preparing the finish off the spilled save. Never felt so much anticipation when I see a cross delivered into the box. I hope he starts banging the goals in for us soon. It will be fecking beautiful.

1574~~~
Spot on, our forwards just arent really clicking or helping much in build up either, di maria, herrera and mata linked up play beautifully in the final third

1575~~~
Mata was good and Rooney improved in the second half. I hate these IF Di Maria wasn't on form business...He was and we won. you could make an argument like that about every team in the world. IF Costa wasn't on form yesterday Chelsea wouldn't have won!

1576~~~
And the past 3 games where we didn't have Di Maria, we drew/lost with THE SAME FRONT THREE. You're severely underestimating the impact he has on the team.

1577~~~
I'm not, but you are underestimating the impact Rooney and specifically Mata had today. Di Maria is a £60m player, he's here to win games. We also played a completely different system and we're nowhere near as fluid. Can't really compare. You're making it sound as if we're suddenly a one man team, and that man is a player we signed 2 weeks ago.

1578~~~
They had an impact BECAUSE OF DI MARIA. I don't doubt Mata/Rooney/RVP's ability, but I do in a 1-2 formation up front. I said this time and time again before we even bought him, a wide player of his calibre will strike fear into the heart of defenders, making room for our other players, and if we didnt play 2 up front with 1 behind they would be able to do even more.

1579~~~
We had good width and on another day, RVP would have scored a couple - there were chances. Rooney scored, as did Mata, who was also generally was very good.

The whole point in playing the 41212 is that we can have Di Maria in his best position, so excluding him ignores one of the key reasons to use the diamond - i.e. to get the best out of Di Maria. It also got the best out of Herrera who was outstanding. This way Blind and Mata are also are at their best. This was the first time in a long time that our midfield was able to dominate another team. 

Yes, it was QPR, but if you look at the difference between this and Burnley, who we should have won easily against, we were much much better. We could win 10-0 using the diamond and you would still complain.

For me, the change in formation was really important to the win and the way we played.

1580~~~
Well of course! But I don't think we'd suddenly turn to shit if Di Maria isn't playing. If anything as soon as Mata came off we looked worse.

1581~~~
So did I <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Qeens Park Rogers <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Jokes aside, I think he seems too nervous which also makes me think he wants to do a really good job here and possibly stay here for years to come. The goals will surely come and there's enough firepower in the team that can compensate for his lack of goals if at all he needs time to settle in.

1582~~~
Anyone seen the Sky Sports interview with him pointing at that photo calling Gary Nev Phil <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

1583~~~
He has to start over RVP. The latter seems to struggling with something. Its either his fitness or the system. Falcao needs to start next to Rooney with Mata behind them.

1584~~~
Did you not watch Di Maria last season? He is  better  as a central midfielder(in certain formations that use a 3 man midfield) than a winger although he is very good in both positions.

The Diamond is perfect for us because:

1. It allows us to make the most of Di Maria in his best position.

2. Blind is very comfortable as a defensive midfielder and having him there allows both Di Maria and Herrera to have a lot more attacking freedom, which as we saw today , worked wonders.

3. Mata is protected by three midfielders behind him basically negating his tendency to become a defensive passenger. He also sees a lot more of the ball and does not have to keep dropping so deep to collect it.

1585~~~
Welbeck would've scored from that chance. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

1586~~~
A few good touches, played RVP through on goal and was in good positions to receive the ball a couple of times, Januzaj could've squared it to him for a tap in and Rooney also could've squared it for a tap in. van Gaal said both him and Shaw need some work to get to 100% and I'm sure Falcao will be excellent once he reaches that level. I'm pleased with his debut.

Would've most likely scored those couple of headed chances RVP got early on during the first half, Falcao will do miracles with his heading ability since we've missed such a player since Rooney when Valencia was good.

1587~~~
He has played just 2 matches since his knee injury. Starting him next match is premature.

1588~~~
He's played 3 matches since recovering from his knee injury back in April. He took his rehabilitation and physiotherapy very seriously and got a lot of time for his knee to undergo the healing which most players are rushed through mid-season. I think he can play for 1 hr next game if van Gaal thinks he's ready.

1589~~~
Got into good positions today. He looks like he's lacking sharpness which is fair given his injury but if we keep creating chances, he'll score goals.

1590~~~
I love the end of that video, he says he will do everything in his power to make the club keep him with his performances and he wants to become a club legend in the coming years. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1591~~~
I thought he looked lively when he came on but our tempo had slowed a bit and Valencia was on so it lessened his chances, wish he'd managed to score off the rebound from Blind's shot. The reception the fans gave him when he warmed up and then came on must have made him feel great. I hope he starts up top with Rooney next week, RvP just looks out of sorts to me.

1592~~~
I thought his injury was in January. Also he played a couple of pre-season games also didn't?

1593~~~
I meant April as the date he started his rehabilitation program, or well the last week of March.

1594~~~
Should have scored his chance. Sell him.<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1595~~~
Absolutely, a Wellbeck chip was in order there.

1596~~~
Cant wait to see him in the team once every things is in full flow and he in top form.

RvP looked like the person not fitting into today, so I can see him being dropped for Falcao

1597~~~
Fans favourite before kicking a ball <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Good to hear the Falcao song doing the rounds throughout the day. All the memorabilia being sold outside the stadium was Falcao related, so it seems everyone has took a shine to him. Could become a bit of a cult hero here, our fans love players like this.

1598~~~
Thats a quality interview.

I honestly think he's desperate to succeed here so that he can be considered a proper 'great', or in his words, a 'legend'. Obviously his record is immense, but I think he needs to do it at a really top top club (with the greatest of respect to Porto/Athletico/Monaco) for him to really feel fulfilled. I reckon that why he was desperate to move to Madrid or United, and turned down the likes of City and Liverpool.

1599~~~
This.  He came across unbelievably well in that interview.  My wife came home and I felt incredibly guilty about my new crush <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1600~~~
My Friend who is a Liverpool fan -'I have never seen a player who is warming up getting so much applause'

1601~~~
I can't get his chant out of my head.

Lololololololo Radamel Falcaoooo
Lololololololo lolololololo RADAMEL FALCAOOOOOOO

1602~~~
It was hilarious tbf <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1603~~~
His existence generated the best 'jolly' atmosphere since number 20. I didn't realise why everyone randomly went mental because the bloke next to me had a large head so I couldn't see the dugouts.

Great chant! Took me a while to figure out the "words" today.

1606~~~
I heard it being sung for the majority of the game. Brilliant chant

Many doubted if this would be a success because of the accent, but I'm surprised. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> It's such an awesome chant!

1611~~~
Source?

1612~~~
Got to imagine, had he all of RvP's chances, he'd at least have had a brace.


Then again, I'd have expected the same of RvP.....

1613~~~
Listen to Ballague's interview on Sky. He was bent on going to Madrid and it looked secured all summer until this Di Maria deal happened. Also do you honestly think Liverpool could afford his wages?

1614~~~
Certainly, good to see nevertheless. I don't think anything else in the match (including Rio at the beginning) got so much applause!

1615~~~
Just imagine.. Compare the applause Falcao got while warming up as against the welcome he would have got at Stade Louis at Monaco!

1616~~~
The sum of supporters in all the home matches he's played for Monaco may not even equal an OT at full capacity.

1617~~~
Ouch <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1618~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1619~~~
The thing that impressed me in his cameo was the chance from the rebound. All the defence stood still but Falcao had such quick reactions and a great striker instinct to get to the rebound

1620~~~
Typical Welbeck miss.

1621~~~

1622~~~
Absolutely <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I was of the opinion that he is just here for the money ala Tevez; but watching his interview, his intelligence, reception at OT et all, warming up to the man now <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1623~~~
Spot on. When you see the point at which he switched on to the possibility that there might be a rebound, compared to how slowly everybody else reacted, you can see why he scored so many goals.

1625~~~
That's one epic welcome. Guys like Falcao bring the football atmosphere with them on every stadium.

It's a healthy situation for the club that must unite again for the sake of success.

1626~~~
I enjoyed the interview he did with Geoff Shreeves. Especially when Falcao was naming all the former United players on the wall outside the dressing room. He got his Neville's mixed up though <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>


The Falcao chant seemed almost non-stop. I can't remember a player who we've given a bigger reception to for a long time. It was great.

1627~~~
van Persie probably.

1628~~~
It was unbelievable, wasn't it? Never seen that for a sub warming up. Cant get it out of my head today. Mitten says in his column today:

1629~~~
I remember Fergie was very keen to get Kluivert to United. Clearly RvP and Falcao are having a anti-Rooney plotting session. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1630~~~
Its definitely the catchiest chant we've ever had. I've been whistling it at work.

It sounded like a great atmosphere on TV. Daley Blind also said how the home crowd blew him away.

I hope we continue to be as loud, home and away.

1631~~~
Amen.

1632~~~
I love we've got the chant going. Seeing the actual game is now only marginally the most exciting thing about going to OT this season. He's going to be a cult hero because of the chant alone.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1tCAg59XiNY?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1633~~~
I just hope his United career doesn't go the way of other initially exciting new signings who immediately provoked a catchy and enjoyable chant. I'm looking at you Ander-son-son-son.

1634~~~
Weighing up the probabilities in an admittedly completely arbitrary way, I think he's the most likely of any of our new boys to be. Considering the hit rate of transfers, you've got to expect some disappointment in the balance of things, especially with 6 new arrivals. For every one to be a hit would be an almost unheard of master stroke of business and management. All the others look to have a defined purpose and Immediate starting role too, plus have got off to an absolute flyer (but then so did Djemba Djemba) and if anyone fits the Veron mould it's him.

Still, feck that kind of noise. I'd still love him for the chant alone. It's almost worth the money for the  bounce it'll bring back to OT ....it's the new Viva Ronaldo (probably)

1635~~~
Genuine question, what's the Falcao chant like? I can't catch it from the clip

1636~~~
lo-lo-lolo-lo-lo-loooooo RADAMEL FALCAO!
lo-lo-lo-lolo-lolo lololololololol
RADAMEL FALCAO!

1637~~~
Yeah, it's like that.

1638~~~
Difference being he's a proven top class player who single-handedly annihilated Chelsea in a final. Not to mention tormented the likes of Barcelona and Madrid for a couple of years. He'll be just fine, provided he stays fit.

1639~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The lolololol part killed me.

1640~~~
Best atmosphere we have had for a long time.

1641~~~
Excellent stuff. 

*ring ring*

kluivert : Hello?

LVG: Patrick... I need a favour. 

Kluivert: Sure Boss. 

LVG: Mind taking my two supershtar strikers out for dinner? We need a relationship going between those two. Can't play them both at the same time. 

Kluivert: Aah sure thing Boss.

LVG: Oh and Patrick, don't invite Wayne. I've already made him captain. Plus none of you will understand a word he'd say anyway. 

*click*

*LVG sat before his fireplace with a glass of French wine*

1642~~~
Is Falcao some sort of divine intervention sent by God?

Did nobody else just get the feeling that everything would be ok when we officially signed him up. People worship him already and you could just sense the lift in fellow reds when we finally got him. It almost felt like he was sent to restore us to our former glory.

/RawkishPost

1643~~~
I wonder how much the relation outside of the pitch affects a "partnership". Anybody got any good stories of people who clicked outside of the pitch, who very played well - or people who didn't click outside the pitch but they played well anyhow.

1644~~~
Damn wish he had scored yesterday. He should have dinked the keeper. Would have been the icing on the cake.

1645~~~
Evra and Park was a good example of it for a while.

1646~~~
You could tell he was too desperate to score. When he gets that first goal out of the way he'll dispatch that chance in his sleep. When he's in the groove he dinks the keeper from all over the place. I think he naturally would have done if not for the occasion.

1647~~~
Still wouldn't have managed it. The goalie was right infront of him.

1648~~~
Wish we had just put that down payment down like Ballague said two years ago. With RVP out for most of last season, he would have helped us. But then again if we had Falcao last season, Moyes would still be in charge because we would have done better than 7th. So everything worked out.

1649~~~
I think this is true as well. A little overwhelmed maybe with emotion.

1650~~~
Loving it! I didn't expect it to catch on so soon either!

1651~~~
Falcao is going to get lotsa goals this year with crosses coming in from Di Maria, Shaw, Januzaj & through balls from Mata, Rooney, Herrera

1652~~~
I can't remember seeing such applause for a warm up.

1653~~~
Loved the applause he got, i don't get why everyone is jizzing over the chant though.

1654~~~
Probably because it's one of the more upbeat, bouncy chants we've had since Viva Ronaldo.

1655~~~
Maybe i'm a boring cnut. Was always more partial to Scholesy's kumbaya myself.

1656~~~
Adnan's one is good too. Falcao's just has a nice ring to it..and doesn't require much effort.

1657~~~
I always thought Viva Ronaldo was miles better. Well we sing it again when he returns next summer

1658~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihY3aZB1sEE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

If anyone hasnt seen it yet. Also how can a human being as big as him possibly be so humble and so modest? God damn Geoff Shreves though. He says some shitty stuff in his interviews.

1659~~~
Cole and Sheringham really didn't like each other whatsoever off the pitch, but hey they played well together.

1660~~~

1661~~~
We must have just about the nicest team in the world right now <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1662~~~
That's a great chant. 

You know, the vibe and atmosphere was electric when he started warming up on the sidelines. And then at that instant Mata scores. fecking beautiful moment. I've only ever seen these type of surreal moments at Old Trafford.

1663~~~
Delighted we got this chap and massacred Welbeck.

1664~~~
Thread carefully, it's wise not to even mention him.


Agreed! Shaw is pretty much the only exception to the new signings, but he's a hyped up English youth, so it's too be expected.

1665~~~
You're in for it now! Brace yourself!

1666~~~
1:50, pulling up his sleeves. It's unbelievable that guy that gets to play in front of so many people, probably gave tens of interviews still is so nervous in front of a camera. That's a huge positive for me, it's a sign of modesty.

1667~~~
Would that actually matter? For all, he can be the most arrogant SoB out there, as long as he does not show disrespect to the club/fans and do unethical stuff, he is OK.

1668~~~
I find ability to pull your sleeves correctly when under pressure to be a very imporant asset to any player.

1669~~~
Everyone knows he is an attention-seeking wum. Don't fall for it.

1670~~~
I was only taking the piss mate. I actually agree with him. Gota laugh at those complaining that we let go of Welbeck and brought in Falcao!

1671~~~
It wasn't really much of a 'partnership' but Suarez and Sturridge managed to bag a shed load of goals and assists together, and there were quite a few reports the two didn't like one another.

1672~~~
There's plenty of people at my work I don't particularly like but we still get the job done. It's just being professional. Don't see how liking a person really makes much of a difference.

1673~~~
The good thing with falcao, he looked dangerous, we will see if he does play saturday

1674~~~
Really hope he starts on sunday, can't wait to see him bag his first goal.

1675~~~
Small chance of that, but I reckon he's got a good chance on Sunday when the game is on.

<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1676~~~
Wow, he's really humble. You almost can't say he's one of the top strikers in the world. We are going to really love this guy.

1677~~~
I love that he says he refused another club, it was definitely City!  <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ... also good that he didn't mention the clubs that were after him, truly professional.

1678~~~
Yorke and Cole clicked both off and on the pitch.  It was a amazing strike partnership, for that one season anyway.

1679~~~

Nice move at 20''

1680~~~
such a nice guy. i hope he score goals and stay here for quite some time too.

1681~~~
Sign up red samurai.

1682~~~
Got a funny feeling we might see Falcao starting on Sunday, I think Leicester could really be the type of game built for him, And with RVP not in great form \ fitness then it would be a good chance to see El Tigre showing what he is made of. He certainly isn't here to sit on the bench and is going to need to start games at some point so it would not surprise me one bit if he was in the lineup Sunday, Going to be interesting to see how LVG manages the 3 strikers this season as RVP \Falcao and Rooney are all the type of strikers that need a run of starts to get in form, Not really impact sub strikers ala Hernandez etc.

1683~~~
He really looks like he is loving it here, isn't he? Him and Di Maria are going to put back the fear factor into the team for certain, you could see it against QPR from Di Maria alone.

1684~~~
Would have said that before QPR but I think it actually turned out toe be RvP's best performance yet. Be a shame to drop him if he's on the cusp of hitting some form. Really tough team selection for Van Gaal this weekend.

1685~~~
Any chance we could play this Samurai chap as a centre half?

1686~~~

1687~~~
Just read the title but I thought that was already obvious, no? We're hardly gonna sign him or pay his full wages if his knee goes again. Even if its not for our benefit I hope he recovers fully, he's a quality player to watch no matter who he plays for, nice guy too mind.

1688~~~
He would need to play up front. He'd really cut through defences! (See what I did there?)

Looking forward to his performance. My expectation of him is so high that I believe he could provide competition for Costa and Aguero for the golden boot. In my opinion, the di maria and falcao duo can be more lethal than the fabregas and diego costa partnership. Hopefully, he becomes a constant in our starting eleven if he puts on a good performance.

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1691~~~
Two chances in two minutes, and people said he offers nothing more than goals! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1692~~~
What a player

1693~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1694~~~
Feck me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Who said that?

1695~~~
He offered RvP some goals! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1696~~~
Great assist.

1697~~~
His lay-offs and link up play are very good, once he gets a goal and half a dozen games under his belt he is gonna be huge for us.

1698~~~
Deserved a goal. Great technique.

1699~~~
Common falcao..

1700~~~
2 moments of quality (RVP goal and when he hit the bar) but he was pants apart from that.

1701~~~
He still needs a bit more match fitness me thinks. He needs to start the next home game. If he scores one, he will be fine. Too much expectation on his shoulder right now.

1702~~~
He was good in the buildup, was quite impressed. Lost too much aerial duels tho.

1703~~~
Rusty, hardly that surprising.

1704~~~
Great cross for RVP goals and unlucky with his attempt that hit the bar. The fitter he gets, the more influence he will have. Already seems to have a good understanding with the others up there.

1705~~~
All round game was poor. Moments of class as well, of course. Understandable.

1706~~~
Is his all round game better then that? Cos in all honesty, today he reminded me of just a better version of Hernandez.

1707~~~
He did have a lot of games like that at Atletico. That's why I felt Costa's season last year was better than Falcao's the year before, because he added more than goals.

1708~~~
He is no way near fully fit, probs at 65% of his best, but he still linked up well providing great touches and flicks. When is fully confident he is a menace, his movement is brilliant, i.e look at the first goal how he peeled off. If you think he can't offer much more than Hernandez then you haven't seen enough of him. 2 footed, brilliant in the air and can strike a mean ball. Not particularly fast or strong but his all round game is top notch..

1709~~~
I'd add another one, before he made the cross for RVP, there was a similar situation where he lost his marker and crossed it to RVP too.

1710~~~
Thought he was dropping deeper than RVP and getting more involved in the buildup play, which is weird. When you have a goal-machine like him, it would have make much more sense having him than RVP at the top picking up the end of chances. Good assist and was so close to scoring a beauty. Still think he and RVP were in opposite roles today though.

1711~~~
I think we need to see him up top with Rooney with Mata in behind. He offered more than Robin today i feel. Obviously still not 100% though, so i'd only try that when he is.

1712~~~
His work rate was good but i felt he was muscled off the ball too much and his hold up play was pretty bad. Still i dont think hes fully fit but still looked dangerous on the ball.

1713~~~
He played pretty well today in my opinion. That cross for the first was an absolute peach and a great effort for the one that hit the bar. Struggled to get involved a bit at times, we need to get him a proper goalscoring opportunity, not played him in once yet!

1714~~~
I liked what I saw, given he is clearly some way from being fully fit. A few moments of genuine class though very rusty at times. I guess we will have to be patient.

1715~~~
Cracking strike off the bar today. Linked up well in attack and had some decent moments. Obviously still a bit rusty but you sense there's a lot more to come.

And that chant, oh my God it's infectious...

1716~~~
WHat needs to be remembered is that was his longest game played since his ACL injury six months ago, so he is still aiming to get back to full fitness even though he has played six games this season. I gave him another couple of weeks at the very least to see him at full fitness, then we should be seeing some great results from him.

Was happy today from what I saw. I can see the danger lurking, but he needs a bit more time to get that execution done better.

1717~~~
I actually thought he was taller. When he went up for a corner I was surprised how many players were head and shoulders above him.

I liked what I saw today. Bit more fitness and he will be a first team starter.

1718~~~
Why? He had a full pre-season with Monaco and played 3 games for them. I doubt he's that far behind fitness wise, if he was he wouldn't have started today.

1719~~~
He needs a lot more then a pre season after being out for like 7 months.

1720~~~
I was impressed by him. He was good with the ball outside the box and nearly scored a great goal. He got bullied off the ball a little bit but it was only his first start. I'd definitely start him over RVP if it came down to it.

1721~~~
Such a positive player & has an excellent all round game. Once he finds his feet I expect the goals to flow.

1722~~~
I thought he was pretty good all things considered

1723~~~
Hernandez couldn't even dream of laying on such a composed assist.

1724~~~
His pre season wasn't a proper one, he never really played 90mins off the back of a long time out. In terms of fitness hes probs almost there but hes far off in terms of his overall footballing wise.

1725~~~
Why? We for one he didn't start a game since the last week of August. So thats more than three weeks where his only game time was a few minutes against Brazil and 20 mins against QPR. On top he had a hell of a lot of traveling to do with our transfer and the international break. You can't possibly expect him to maintain fitness through that period but from the looks of it, he isn't far away from full fitness. I just want him unleashed.

1726~~~
His all around game is(always has been) poor. That and his first touch are the only weaknesses in his game. But his lethal finishing makes up for that.

1727~~~
See, this worries me. His weaknesses seem to be quite vast in all honestly. He might be the 'best finisher' in the world, but that doesn't make him the best striker.

1728~~~
Me too, his hold up play could be better but that was expected given his lack of match game time.

I guess people just want him to fail so we can buy back Welbeck...

1729~~~
(Just my opinion) United needed a player like Mangala instead of Falcao. Defence was a more pressing issue IMO.

1730~~~
I'm hoping this isn't the case. I haven't seen a great deal of Falcao in all honesty, but I assume his first touch is a lot sharper than it was today?

1731~~~
After a long lay off I don't expect much from him until at least the new year. Signs are good though.

1732~~~
His first touch was shocking but I'm hoping that's due to being rusty. Unlucky with his shot against the bar, great assist for RvP but other than that he was pretty average.

1733~~~
I know it might be weird but I always feel a player is better off making his full debut at home. I don't know, I just feel it makes it a bit more comfortable on the player. I guess there's some theory that we should be more comfortable in a home game we should be more comfortable and that should translate to the player in question. 

I really hope he starts next week and gets off the mark with a couple. Another week of training and getting used to the boys aswell.

1734~~~
Same Mangala that can't get a game at the minute?

I know what your saying about defence being a pressing issue but I genuinely don't think their was guaranteed defensive quality available this summer.

1735~~~
I was fairly impressed with him today. Not a superb performance, but he's still settling in and I thought his overall game looked better than RVP.

1736~~~
He was very promising all things considered. His assist was absolutely brilliant and he was a touch unfortunate with the shot that hit the bar. Works his socks off too.

1737~~~
Oh really?

What about his wonderful assist for Kagawa in Fergie's last game?

1738~~~
Meh, Falcao's played at the top level for a while now and seems like a fairly confident player. I doubt he'd be too phased by making his full debut in an away game, especially one which shouldn't have been as difficult as it was if we'd been more solid at the back today.

1739~~~
Poor first touch, but exquisite cross for van Persie's goals and an excellent effort off the bar. He isn't the most well-polished and complete players, so I think some of the touches and disappointing hold-up play at times can be expected, but I still expect plenty of improvement. He's still building up his fitness.

1740~~~
It's not even a fecking contest. Falcao is a good few levels above Hernandez. I'm in shock we're even debating this.

1741~~~
I'm not debating that, I'm debating your claim that he could've never laid on such a wonderfully composed assist when I've seen him do it.

Until today I sure as hell hadn't seen Falcao do it.

Oh, and overall I thought Falcao looked rusty but promising today. Seems to come alive inside the box (not unlike Hernandez) but obviously he's a better player.

Must do better in terms of overall game though, if there's to be any sense in playing all of him, Rooney and RvP.

1742~~~
Tbf mangala made his debut today and looked like he'd been playing in the pl all his life. City might finally not be up shit creek when kompany (inevitably) gets injured.

1743~~~
He's going to be class. Our forward play was fantastic today IMO.

1744~~~
I agree with you, and on paper Falcao didn't have a bad debut. Nice assist to get us on our way and a fantastic dipping volley showed just how confident he is. It's more of a personal feeling.

1745~~~
Thought his link up play with RVP was very good today and also his awareness when he was on the ball.
Looks like a very good singing for us and only a matter of time before he gets on the score sheet.
That cross to RVP was a peach.

1746~~~
I have to be honest, having heard all this about him being the best striker in the world, and now hearing people say that actually he doesn't have a great first touch, isnt very fast, isnt very strong, doesn't provide much in the buildup...well, I'm quite underwhelmed.

1747~~~
This. Di Maria, Rooney, Falcao and van Persie will score sack loads if the last two games are anything to go by.

1748~~~
Let me give you a tip - don't listen to the imbeciles.

1749~~~
And on his PL debut is MotM against Chelsea... I think he grabbed the position for good, unless he has a blunder in the next game or something like that.

1750~~~
There isn't, and never will be any sense in doing that. It's Falcao or RvP as the focal point of the attack, both offer way too little else to be played at the same time.

It's a nice problem to have as it means the one who's benched gives more in training and pushes the other one out and vice-versa - two great players constantly competing with each other to be better.

Start them both together though along with Rooney and you've got an unbalanced team and (probable) complacency.

Thought Falcao was bright today, looks rusty still, but his assist and crossbar hit were both very promising.

1751~~~
So frustrating, I keep thinking that but then remember we lost, conceding 5 goals in the process <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1752~~~
He was ok I thought, unlucky with the effort that hit the bar. He desperately needs a goal, once he gets started he won't stop.

1753~~~
Thought he was good. Considering he's supposed to be a poacher who never gets assists that was a lovely cross.

Now please, for the love of God, drop Van Persie!

1754~~~
He still doesn't look match fit or up to speed to me, understandable and he was a little bit in and out of the game bar the assist. Overall a very promising debut.

1755~~~
Agree. He is still less than match fit, unlike van Persie who should be doing better by now.

1756~~~
He was pretty good. Always a danger and what an assist.

1757~~~
Seems like all our forwards are just doing anything they can to scrap. Which is not really ideal - nobody really creating constant pressure with a go to move. Seems Van Persie should just sit on the shoulder every time and wait for an assist through. He's nearly scored a few times from that yet I see him dropping and hustling and then coming deep.

I didn't really get a sense of how Falcao likes to play yesterday. In a way he was a bit all over the place and still finding his feet. If our forwards could just stick to doing one thing and doing it constantly to net goals then we might be less open on the counter. I find when the forwards drop and the formation breaks there are a few players in the deeper positions that don't really get how to form up and defend when players around them are out of position.

1758~~~
The shot that hit the post..  that would have been some goal..

1759~~~
It's weird how similar to Hernandez he is. Of course Falcao is of a higher class but their qualities and weaknesses are so similar.

1760~~~
Have to disagree, Falcao can play. That's not a dig at Hernandez but Hernandez is good in the box, he is actually a pretty average footballer at th etop level, Falcao can play, not just finish.

1761~~~
Same. Better than RVP (who he made the goal for) and Rooney (who created Leicester's 3rd).

1762~~~
Are you getting what i'm saying??
Qualities = things you are good at
Weaknesses = things you are not so good at
class = The level at which you can perform said qualities

1763~~~
I understand that but Hernandez's weakness is his footballing ability, something that cannot be said about Falcao. Have you seen the first touch of Hernandez?

1764~~~
Yeah. I said "all things considered" cos there's a lot to be consisted. New team, new league, questionable fitness etc. this was basically his debut and he did very well by all accounts. I didn't expect half the contribution he gave today. He rarely gave it away, played the right pass 90% of the time and RVPs goal was entirely down to his movement and quality cross. 

Plus the only sniff of a chance he got he nearly executed perfectly. For the role he was playing half fit in a very physical away game, I think he was pretty darn impressive.

And I don't use the word darn lightly. Or indeed, at all.

1765~~~
He looks very much like an upgraded Hernandez to me.

1766~~~
hence "higher class". <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> come on people, i'm not saying They are equals just that they share the same qualities and same weaknesses.

1767~~~
He's better at the things Hernandez is good at. But he's got so much more, strength, link-up ability. He's a much more complete player.

1768~~~
I totally agree mate.

1769~~~
Silly comparing him to Hernandez, he's significantly better at absolutely everything.

Falcao has a touch, for a start. He's a good dribbler and can hold it up, neither of which Hernandez can do.

1770~~~
Hmmm, he didn't look particularity strong to me today, and his link up play and first touch didn't look anything out of the ordinary.

I'm probably being overly critical because of the 'hype' surrounding him, and because of his record. I guess I'm expecting a bonafide superstar.

1771~~~
More than anything else I'd say what separates him from Hernández is his ability in the air. Not that Hernández is weak in that area, just that Falcao is (or was at Atlético at least) the best striker in the world at heading the ball.

1772~~~
This. I also think we should drop RVP for the next game

1773~~~
I was completely shocked by the accuracy of <i>that</i> cross ('you have so much time, what are you doing?') and the audaciousness of <i>that </i>shot. This boy's got talent.

1774~~~
His movement to beat the defender prior to the cross was class as well. Like a fox.

1775~~~
Not everyone is Messi or Ronaldo, and this isn't FIFA, you can't expect players to dribble around three defenders and a do a bicycle kick in his first start under a new manager at a new club in a new league.

He's a centre forward, one of the best there is in world football.

But he's also coming off a knee injury, and he'll take time to adjust and gel with his new team mates.

I thought he played fine. The cross was dead accurate and that shot of his that came off the bar, not many players would have the technique to generate that type of pace from that position to beat the goalie. And the amount of times I saw him ready to make a run and signal, yet get ignored by Rooney was astonishing. Someone like Mata with a quicker release would have been perfect.

1776~~~
I have been saying this so many times, he's not what we need and shouldn't spend a lot of money just to loan him a season. We should use that money to get a world class centre back instead. I'm not judging Rojo and Falcao 1 poor performance here, what I mean is I think it would be much better if we sign a world class centre back like Hummels or whoever are great quality and has a leader attitude instead of signing striker. 

Good luck for Falcao to help us to get into Champion League.

1777~~~
One has nothing to do with the other, if Dortmund were willing to sell and he was wanting to leave we'd have signed Hummels regardless, but they didn't and he didn't so we couldn't.

1778~~~
Money will convince Dortmund. Remember how Klopp said that Dortmund is still a selling club.

1779~~~
If money would have convinced then this summer I think we would have spent it, but they try to only lose one of their main assets per summer and this summer it was Lewandowski.

1780~~~
We would. But we didn't because LVG picked Rojo. LVG picks the player, and we prepare the money. LVG picked Falcao even though Monaco is in Champion League. We have a bigger history and ambition than Dortmund and Monaco and LVG is a bigger manager than Klopp. In the past I don't believe we could but after seeing that we could convince Monaco and Falcao with money then I think it's not impossible to sign Hummels from Dortmund last summer if we want to give a try.

1781~~~
I don't think he picked Rojo over Hummels, Rojo was the left footed CB option when Vermaelen fell through. I truly think had there been any way to get Hummels here this summer we would have done it, but you have to consider Hummels might not want to leave, LvG may be bigger than Klopp but he is also 15 years older so has had the time to achieve more, and to Hummels Klopp is a mentor. Plus Dortmund play in front of arguably the best home support in Europe with a huge 80,000 gate every time.

1782~~~
I'm not saying he picked Rojo over Hummels. But his choice was a left footer defender who can play as a left back and centre back in 352 and not give a try on Hummels. But now we have Blind who can play as a left back and we probably will play 4 in the back.

As I said before, Klopp admitted that Dortmund is still a selling club.
If we reach agreement with Dortmund to sell the player then Hummels will have no choice but to leave as long as we can afford the wage he asks.

1783~~~
Guess I should have watched that game before I made that post...

1784~~~
I am shocked that people were anything but very impressed with a proven world class player working his way back slowly from a very serious knee injury. I thought he showed that he was a different class today, even to RVP (who admittedly looks a little out of form).

1785~~~
He produced two world class moments.. genuine top drawer stuff which only the elite are capable of and the rest was meh, but he is working his way to fitness - it is so evident how clumsy he still was, but on the plus side.. you could tell he still has a burst of pace to him, he's definitely going to be quick once he gets sharp.

1786~~~
If he is still building his fitness then the signs are promising.

1787~~~
Falcao is mainly a penalty box striker. I've watched him a lot for 3 years. Seeing him cross that ball for van Persie surprised me because It's not really something I've ever seen him do, just like when he put Costa through against RM in the copa final. Build up play isn't usually his game, so anyone expecting more will be disappointed. He almost is a bit like Hernandez, his touch is a bit loose and dribbling isn't his strongest point. Luckily finishing is and he's a much more deadly goalscorer.

1788~~~
His choice would have been to sign Rojo and Hummels but Hummels didn't want to leave Dortmund and they didn't want to sell, and none of that has anything to do with Falcao, all would be separate pieces of business not dependent on one and other.

1789~~~
should have never started instaed of Mata, nowhere near the first team fitness wise. I dont understand van Gaal's logic, playing Falcao and leaving Shaw on the bench. I wanted the same lineup as last game, with fit palyers and not players who can play 50 mins only.

1790~~~
He hasn't say anything about Hummels. And again, if both clubs reach an agreement then all left is just talk contract with the agent of players. Even if Hummels doesn't want to leave but the club wants to sell the player because of money then Hummels has no choice but to leave. Falcao + Rojo signing means we have plenty money to spend on Hummels. As I said before, Klopp already admits that Dortmund is still a selling club. It's not an impossible deal last summer.

1791~~~
I loved how he stepped towards the ball dragging the defender with him then quickly turned. So simple but it worked so well

1792~~~
His linkup play was good, he accelerates our play and doesnt keep the ball too long. Its maybe due to his form but Falcao is a good dribbler.

1793~~~
Many reports say we did ask about Hummels and were told point blank he was not for sale this summer, Dortmund had already lost Lewandwoski so they didn't want another one out of the door and obviously didn't feel they needed the money this summer.

1794~~~
seems like rumours which haven't been confirmed.

1795~~~
We never confirm when we fail.

1796~~~
In other words the link with Hummels was just rumours or gossips which people can't say if it's true or no.

1797~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Falcao's wife says she's in love with Manchester United, release clause not happening for her!</b></span>

1798~~~
When the Athletico version of Falcao eventually emerges, watch out.

1799~~~
His understanding of others is already fantastic. His movement is great as well. 

Everything Hernandez did looked rushed. Falcao is always composed.

1800~~~
Falcao at Athletico is so far ahead of Hernandez it's a pointless discussion. Give him time, he's only played twice for us now, and once off the bench. 

He'll score against West Ham.

1801~~~
I cannot believe we are even mentioning Chicha in the same breath as Falcao, even in yesterday's performance, Falcao looked light years ahead in his touch technique and ability to carry the ball. Of course he made poor touches but thats because he is still not fully fit and settling into a new club. But just from this movement and intimacy with the ball, you can tell he has a lot of give in terms of our overall play.

1802~~~
So we simply push our most important lead player and the personification of Klopp´s football out of the door, because United throws money in our direction? Do you know anything about Borussia Dortmund at all?

Klopp also never admitted that we are a selling club, just that we lost key players in recent years. There is a difference in my book. A selling club is a club like Porto, which depends on transfer income to keep the club from writing red figures. This is not the case with us. We are actually spending money right now to strengthen the squad. 

In three of the four cases of departing key players, Dortmund never intended to sell for money. Sahin and Götze left by triggering their release clauses and Lewandowski fullfilled his contract. That leaves Kagawa as the only concious decision by the club of letting someone leave. Kagawa clearly wanted to fullfill his wish of playing for United and his contract situation made the Summer of 2012 the last window, when we could have gotten decent money for him.

In all cases it was the player who voiced his wish to leave. The club would have kept everyone of them if they had the choice. Two of them have even returned by now after realising that the grass is not always greener on the other side. That makes the idea of us forcing a player as loyal and important as Hummels out for money so hilarious. We don´t need the money and are right now trying to keep them together as long as possible by getting rid of the last remaining release clause in the squad.   

Hummels was never for sell given his contract situation and importance. I don´t know if United made an offer or asked if he was available. It wouldn´t have mattered either way. If Hummels leaves in the future, then it will be because he wants to and not because the club wants to cash in.

1803~~~
He said it in press conference in January that Dortmund is still a selling club. 

It is hilarious, but it's also not impossible to sign your player either because your player wants to leave or because your club wants to cash in. And I already said it already, that we don't know if we made an offer or asked about him. We probably never had any talk about him this summer.

1804~~~
This is a refreshing change.

1805~~~
I doubt klopp ever said that. Anyways, it's not impossible but we'd have to pay aroud what we paid for di maria to bring in hummels. And that's just to get Dortmund to say yes. After that it'd be up to Hummels, and I doubt he'd want to leave dortmund for United at this point. 

Also, dortmund don't really sell their best players. Whenever they leave its not through their choice. They rejected like 35m for lewandowski last year because they would rather make him leave on a free then cash in. Gotze had a release clause. Reus has a release clause which will let him leave. Sahin had a release clause. Kagawa had a year left on his contract and klopp lined up reus anyways. They're just in a much better situation financially now then before, and though they aren't as big of a club financially and can't offer wages like United, they are still a huge club and currently a better one then United.

1806~~~
You doubt, but Klopp actually said it during January winter transfer. Yeah what I meant was if we are willing to spend such a money on Rojo and Falcao then we could went to a higher quality centre back like Hummels and the others. Hummels was just my example that we have a chance to sign if we try in summer.

1807~~~
And to think people were panning him for not being a rounded footballer, not having enough assists etc. That cross could not have been made without sharp footballing acumen and skill to pull the inch perfect cross off. Very encouraging to watch.

It was also the classic 4-4-2 diamond goal, as width is generally provided by the center forwards or full backs (midfielders to an extend). In this system, your center forwards have to pull wide and beat the fullback, which is exactly what Falcao did.

1808~~~
Radamel Falcao is yet to make much of an impact on the pitch for <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterUnited" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a>, but in terms of shirt sales the Colombian has performed phenomenally.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/radamel-falcao-and-angel-di-maria-top-shirt-sales-after-arriving-at-manchester-united-9755113.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...er-arriving-at-manchester-united-9755113.html</a>

1809~~~
Thought he played as well as the circumstances allowed (lack of match fitness, new teammates, new league, difficult away match). Two impressive moments and some semblance of good hold up play mixed with a few not so good moments which will be ironed out. 

Delighted in an exciting manner.

1810~~~
I was thinking exactly the same too. Surely it has proved all those wrong who were saying he only scores inside the box, very rarely, if ever has any assists and is a really selfish forward.

1811~~~
Any similar stats available from Aliexpress too?

1812~~~
What I noticed from his videos and the few matches I have seen him play is that he seems to be very capable with using his weaker left foot. Better at it than RvP or Rooney.

1813~~~
Had you never heard of Falcao before he joined United? He doesn't have a weak foot, similar to Sneijder & Modric but better.

1814~~~
He could have had two assist also, as he set van Persie up perfectly in the box early on, but his touch was loose.

Some promising signs against Leicester. Not the most accomplished performance, but a lot of that is to do with the circumstances as Kevin said. Still, worked hard and defended quite well from the front of times, got a peach of an assist, almost a superb goal and and showed a good few moments of strength and hold-up play. Clearly not at full match-fitness, as his touch was very heavy on a few occasions and he lacked a bit of sharpness in the final third, but he will soon be deadly.

1815~~~
Yep, very good to see. He ran nicely with the ball a few times and laid it off for the midfield.

1816~~~
I've heard people say that he is the only player in the world whose weak foot is stronger than his normal foot!

1817~~~
That's what makes him even more impressive, his ability to score with either foot from distance or close range with a blast or with finesse.

1818~~~
That article would be easier to read in Russian!
Terrible work from a broadsheet.

1819~~~
too early to captain him in fantasy footy still... Costa it is for this weekend...

1820~~~
I really hope he can hit top form for us, but due to the headstart I think Costa will get the golden boot

1821~~~
Really could do with him opening his account against West Ham. They'll score for sure because of our defensive woes

1822~~~
I love playing with him on FIFA 15 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1823~~~
That shot off the bar on the volley was quality. He's a really, really good player.

1824~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.manutd.com/~/media/9F351F382B1E45CC974991D2AB356A89.ashx?mw=500" src="http://www.manutd.com/~/media/9F351F382B1E45CC974991D2AB356A89.ashx?mw=500"/> 

Whats he done to his leg? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1825~~~
Just glad the strapping is not on his knee.

1826~~~
Should only be a cut/gash or something. Saw it in the game that he was actually bleeding through his socks, but he stayed on the pitch and didn't seem to bother much.

1827~~~
God bless her <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> I love this fella already

1828~~~
Of course you do, his dribbling, heading, strength and finishing are so good. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1829~~~
Now Falcao messes my acca up! How was he today? What was that leg thing?

1830~~~
He was looking sharp to me and didn't look happy to be coming off which I felt was understandable given how sluggish RvP is for a role that involves pressing and running a lot.

1831~~~
Looks utterly gutted when he's subbed off. I hope he doesn't get too affected by it.

1832~~~
He's more suited to play that role than RvP, suprised to see him taken off.

1833~~~
Should have stayed on for RVP.

1834~~~
He is making too few runs behind the defence, and isnt often in good positions for a goal. But his linkup play is brilliant.

1835~~~
His holdup play is better than RVP. I'd argue Falcao is fitter than RVP anyway and should have stayed on. RVP was a bad option to lead a line with 10 men.

1836~~~
Very hard to take the ball off this guy. Brilliant link up and looks dangerous each time.

1837~~~
I think he holds the ball better than RVP and rooney combined. Should have been kept on rather than RVP. I think LVG wants him in top condition, hence took him off .

1838~~~
Just needs a goal now.

1839~~~
He's a classic no. 9, isn't he?

1840~~~
He looks a very good footballer. Need to get used to his movemenr and find him in the box more.

1841~~~
Needs a goal to give him a boost of confidence but played well, another assist too. Thought he was going to score today after our start but then we just stopped and one of him and RvP had to be subbed off after the red.

1842~~~
obviously he is being slowly introduced into the game in England. Once fully bedded, he will be amazing for us.

1843~~~
I will keep backing him higher amounts to score, Ive got to win eventually right?

1844~~~
Thought his hold up play was immense today. I'd like to see him running behind the defence a bit more, though. I guess he needs to get used to play with another striker up top, as I'm pretty sure he normally plays as a lone striker.

1845~~~
Just needs a goal and doesn't matter how it goes in really. Like RVP when he had that barren spell in his first year, once he scored again (and it was more of an own goal) then he couldn't stop.

1846~~~
Some of his touches/hold up play was out of this world.

I am also really impressed by his strength on the ball.

1847~~~
Hoping we get a penalty. So he steps up and takes one. Easiest way for him to open his account.

1848~~~
Think he'll step up now that Rooney is out.

1849~~~
What a player. He really is a complete forward, one of those forwards that can be highly effective even when not scoring. He's a bit of a goal machine too isn't he? lets hope he kicks on and bags them in.

1850~~~
Only a matter of time before he scores,delighted we have him.

1851~~~
Like others have said, he would have done a better job holding the ball in the final half hour when we were down to 10 men than RVP did.

1852~~~
Think his allround play is already looking good. Two fantastic assists already to his name and his linkup play with the other forwards is looking great.

The goals will definitely come.

I'm very pleased with him so far.

1853~~~
Quite disappointed that he hasn't been able to hit the ground running in terms of goals, Diego Costa style. Would have expected as much from a player of his quality, but he simply seems to be struggling to get into goal scoring positions at the moment.

A bedding in period is only natural, but like I said, when talking about a player like him, who is of the highest quality, I would expect him to hit the ground running. But his all round play is positive and I expect him to properly find his feet and the back of the goal before long. And of course, in terms of the Costa comparison, Radamel (most awesome given name ever) didn't get the benefit of any sort of pre season with his new team mates.

1854~~~
Difference is Falcao already has 2 assists in, what, 90 minutes combined play? Diego Costa has the luxury of playing as a lone striker and play all his matches.

1855~~~
But Costa was completely fit, and had been playing regularly for club and country when he joined Chelsea. He has also joined a team that was already very good, and one that is not in transition and rebuild mode like ours is. He also has had the benefit of pre-season with Chelsea and has been there much longer than Falcao has here and he is settled. I was at the game and his hold up play was fantastic today. It's only a matter of a few more games before the goals start going in I'm sure of it.

1856~~~
Yes, of course, there are nuances which should be brought to the table in a comparison. But at the end of the day, Falcao will be judged by his goal return. Anything else is just giving legitimacy to those saying we should have just kept *** guy around <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1857~~~
Cut him some slack . The guy had a career threatening injury in January and only played a couple of 15 minute cameos before joining us . Let him get back up to full fitness .

1858~~~
Did good today, good all round performance. Also he seems to have a good understanding with RVP.

1859~~~
This guy absolutely oozes class, his link up play is far better than I imagined for a striker this prolific.  I love watching him play and I have no doubt the goals will come.

1860~~~
He's a top class player. His linkup play is brilliant. Also holds the ball better than any of our other forwards.

Not worried about the lack of goals. They will come, and when they do come they will be in loads.

1861~~~
You need to adjust your expectations. Diego Costa is coming off a career year whereas Falcao is coming off a serious injury.

1862~~~
Will get a lot of service and attention now that Rooney is out I believe. Hope he starts banging in, 'cos it was a little disappointing that he couldn't hit the ground running with his goals. I think he will judged by his goal tally than anything else, so I'd love for him to score one soon so he can build up some much needed confidence. Personally, I'm very satisified with everything he brings to the team, though.

1863~~~
Very strong on the ball and technically brilliant. Can't wait to see more from him

1864~~~
Much better today. Looked a lot sharper, and stronger too. Showed some great hold up play, and good link up too.

Shame he didn't get any decent chances though.

1865~~~
I reckon he'll score in our next game seeing as Rooney will be missing.

1866~~~
You can tell he's a real talent, his hold up play today was brilliant.

1867~~~
He'll look better in the next few games with a proper #10 in Mata behind him.

1868~~~
Getting closer to that first goal. Once he does get it the goals will flow I'm sure.

1869~~~
I feel the players are a little like the fans, wanting Falcao to score a little too much, it will come, they just have to be patient.

1870~~~
Nothing to worry about on the goals end, the fact of the matter is by some freak occurrence we haven't really created a chance for him yet. His linkup play is good and he's still had some moments where you can just tell he is a class act. He'll be banging them in, in no time. Wouldn't read too much into his reaction to being subbed, I think it was more a slight disappointment at not being able to get off the mark as well as eating up some time when we were beginning to come under some severe pressure. Although I would have rather seen Falcao stay on I can totally understand RVP staying on as in such a situation you need people you can trust to carry out your plan to ride the game out and for Van Gaal that is RVP. He was also practically the de facto captain at that point.

1871~~~
I just want him to score his first goal at home. The crowd will go absolutely ballistic. Hope he scores against Everton, even if its a penalty. That first goal needs to come sooner rather than later. The longer he doesnt score, the more pressure there is for him to try and score and the more it might affect his confidence.

1872~~~
What a player. Everything he's involved in is dangerous. Two shots, two corners. An assist. Good keeper of the ball. And that despite most of our play going through the right. It's just a matter of time before he starts banging them in.

1873~~~
Didn't look too happy today when he got subbed off.  His hold-up play was excellent and his link-up play is vastly underrated.  I remember a few saying that Falcao was a prolific poacher (I imagined a much better version of Chicharito), but he's been great all over the pitch.  Just feels like once he gets his first one, the floodgates will open and he'll be banging in goals for fun.

1874~~~
Needs a goal. Other than his lack of goals though he has been quite good. Like everyone has already said, his hold-up play and strength on the ball is really good.

1875~~~
His overall gameplay is brilliant and what surprises me the most is he doesn't get out muscled very easy on the ball for his size that is amazing.

1876~~~
I don't care if he assists instead of score - the point is the ball is in the net! Very happy with him so far.

1877~~~
I was annoyed when they didn't show a replay of the way he nutmegged a West Ham player who thought he was about to retrieve the ball off him.

He doesn't look like a monster but he's very strong.

1878~~~
It's that classic South American low center of gravity strength! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1879~~~
He is looking a bit anxious to get that first goal out of the way, very understandable for a striker and a striker of his class. His overall play apart from getting that goal has been great though and we will see him doing better once he gets a goal which will calm few nerves.

1880~~~
I agree gereat cross in his first full game for the goal and quick thinking for his assist yesterday. Obviously we all expect more over the season and plenty of goals but for a player who has been out for so long, only joined up with his new team mates so recently in a new league and culture a lot of his work in terms of touch and movement has been good.
I think a lot of his success depends on his team mates getting used to him rather than the other way round as I have noticed him takin gup really good positions quite a few times and he hasnt been fed.

1881~~~
He's looked distraught when coming off in both games, he really wants to score.

1882~~~
Wouldn't put much stock into it. That seems to be his default face.

1883~~~
Once he gets up to speed and gets that first goal, they will start to flow.

1884~~~
From the 3 starting strikers it looked like he was playing the deepest, at least that's the impression I got. He was the one playing people inside the box like he did with RVP and holding up the ball in midfield and at the edge of the box.  Is he being played as the number 10?

1885~~~
I saw the both goals yesterday, and i noticed his movement is amazing, it makes space for other strikers, the first goal is a perfect example, when Rafael crosses it, both of their defenders are soo concerned with him that they leave Rooney free, its credit to him tbf that sometimes as a striker you make runs knowing you probably won't get on the end of that ball, but that run will give your strike partner a better chance to score, i saw that couple of times yesterday he made far post runs which kept their Cb and Rb occupied and the other players had soo much space with the near post runs, maybe its something worked in training.

Another thing i have noticed it he is playing deeper than Rvp, Rooney is obviously Behind him, but he is also working very hard trying to get interceptions and mostly laying off balls for Di Maria or Rooney and then joining in the box while Rvp is mostly in the Box, there was a cross in the First half from Rooney to Rvp Falcao was just a little ahead of rooney asking for a pass, while Rvp was in box waiting for the Header, and he actually attempted the header just couldn't connect it, the same thing happened in the buildup to the second goal, rvp was on the shoulder and he was drop deep trying to snatch away from ball which Herrera took it and then Falcao passed it to Rvp, so its clearly something that is being worked on in training that's why he is not getting at the end of much chances, i think it could also possibly be down to LVG thinking we can't let 2 on top, and this will make us weaker and more fragile to conceding the goals thus him and Rooney trying to do their defensive job, and very likely the reason Rvp wasn't taken off as he was playing on the shoulder the whole match.

I forgot to mention about his hold up play and touches they were amazing, the only thing left is a goal, it will come soon, delighted that we have him excellent player.

1886~~~
I felt the same tbf it was more like, 
              Rvp
Di Maria
     Rooney Falcao
    Blind     Herrera

1887~~~
I think he isn't used to not being the primary option. With the firepower  we have upfront the opportunities will be shared. Hopefully he will come to terms with that as we have get better results.

1888~~~
His link up play is superb - so vastly underrated during the transfer. He also seems to be adapting to the two-striker system. From Opta:

1889~~~
His hold-up play is something else too. The ball was fired at him on numerous occasions on the weekend but the way he brings it down, holds it up and keeps the defender off his back is fantastic. Wouldn't think it by looking at his physique, but he seems very strong in that situation. Linking up really well already.

1890~~~
Playing pretty good and has amazing hold up capabilities. But he just happens to not be on the score sheet unfortunately.

1891~~~
Any highlights of his touches v the hammers?

1892~~~
Work ethics of Tevez, and the ball control of Berbatov. I even fancy his hair - it's even better than Ronaldos and Beckhams put together.
*Mancrush*

1893~~~
Cannot wait for him to get off the mark. Part of me wants it to be a last minute against wonder strike against City away, but that's 4 games away - so better if he gets off the mark sooner for his confidence.

1894~~~
Chelsea then <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> He can do with giving us assists to the winning goals for the next few games.

1895~~~
I wouldn't be too worried about his lack of goals at this point of time. We are banging in goals right left and centre at the moment. Hopefully he will score in big matches which is more important.

1896~~~
A belter against Everton. Like an absolute screamer from 25 yards out.

1897~~~
Its just a matter of goal for him to just explode.I'm eagerly waiting.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1898~~~
Can hear Tyler's voice in my head now

"FAALCAAAAOOOOOOOOO"

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1899~~~
Genuinely surprised how good his overall game is. I'm sure we were led to believe we were just buying a better Hernandez. Hopefully he gets a few chances to score in the next game.

1900~~~
I could only assume that people who thought that had never seen him play for Porto/Atleti/Colombia, his hold up and link play has always been very good..

1901~~~
I reckon he's saving up for a few against Chelsea. He loves the big games <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1902~~~
Remember the hat trick vs Chelsea for Atletico two years ago in the UEFA Super Cup.

1903~~~

1904~~~
Between you, me & the gatepost,  <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> a little bird told me that the only reason he is on loan is because he failed his medical.

Maybe that's common knowledge, but I haven't been following this thread.

He seems to be fit enough at the moment though, so lets hope he keeps it up, although has he played a full 90 yet?  Wasn't he a bit pissed off at being subbed at the weekend?

1905~~~
The loan deal was agreed before the medical.

1906~~~
To be fair he's looked a little off to me. Anyone else get the impression he just doesn't look comfortable? 

Last week against Leicester he was holding his knee for a while after a little collision. Just wondering if he's totally with it and as you said, maybe this is to prove his fitness.

1907~~~
He doesn't have Di Maria pace but his explosive movement over a the first 5 yards is incredible and a great weapon to get a few yards of space in tight situations. Really think he should be our first choice 9.

1908~~~
Expecting his goals in Chelsea, city and Arsenal games.
Who know,there might a hat trick against Everton waiting to happen.

1909~~~
He is quick in his head which is more important really. You can see he is always switched on and moving. I liked how when he laid it off to RVP he sprinted to the back post - any rebounds he was gobbling up.

1910~~~
He looked a lot better against West Ham then he did in the first couple of games, but if I'm being honest, he looks nowhere near the standard of 'best striker in the world' that I was expecting/hoping. And I agree, he doesn't look like he's moving at 100%.

1911~~~
He might not  have the same pace and lethality he did 2 or 3 years ago but he still looks pretty sharp out there, two good assists. Hope he doesnt score against us or play anything like the 2012 cup.

1912~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xn9iqR6hyqU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

If he gets sharper, he is going to tear a team apart very soon.. very brave player, marked very tightly last game but if he had been that touch fitter.. he'd have bagged a goal.

1913~~~
More likely that United wanted to keep Mendes sweet.

1914~~~
Once he scores then there won't be no stopping him, I for one can't wait till he does and I recon the neutrals must be loving watching our attacking players to.

1915~~~
Feel there's more chance of Falcao staying at United, than Ronaldo rejoining united. Just a hunch.

1916~~~
Doesn't have to be Ronaldo. Could be for future transfers. It doesn't hurt to have one of the most powerful agents in football on our side, or in Ed Woodward's case, sending family photos to each other.

1917~~~
Sorry, thought you were making reference to specifically to Ronaldo when talking about trying to keep Mendes sweet.

1918~~~
I thought it was well accepted that it was structured as a loan to help out Monaco with the FFP regs. You never know, though.

1919~~~
Why do we need to help out Monaco?

1920~~~
It benefits Monaco much more with FFP to get the fee off us next summer, not this summer.

Getting £70m for James this summer and £40m+ for Falcao next summer is better for them than getting £110m for both this summer. That's how FFP works. They could make all the money in the world this summer but if they fail to make next summer's balance it means nowt.

1921~~~
It benefits us just as much that it's a loan. I'm sure every club would love to sign big stars on loan for a year with a future fee agreed; just in case they flop.

1922~~~
<a class="username" data-user="48764, @Colin129" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48764/">@Colin129</a> <a class="username" data-user="53721, @The Red Thinker" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/53721/">@The Red Thinker</a> posts deleted, keep the pictures out of the FF please.

1923~~~
So basically, they would have only been interested in a loan because they don't need the money this year?

I have a contact in the media, who I haven't seen for nearly a year, but I did see him at the weekend, that's when he told me that it was a loan because he failed his medical.

He does tend to be pretty cynical about all things football though, especially as regards the money in the game (all footballers are mercenaries etc)

1924~~~
I'd like to see him in and around the box more than he was against Leicester and QPR (didn't see the West Ham game) Maybe with Rooney out, we'll see him that little bit further up the pitch?

1925~~~
Aah apologies.

1926~~~
Been great imo. No one is setting him up. He is setting them up. Once people start creating chances for him he will score.

1927~~~
To be fair does a contact in the media mean anything these days.. it seems they get more clueless with each passing summer - no offence to your contact who might have tangible evidence to back up his story.

1928~~~
This. He's doing all the running for RvP (why??) and playing more like a second striker than an out and out no9.

Play one of them, and play Rooney as the 2nd striker!

1929~~~
I'm not sure why he would make stuff up for my benefit.

1930~~~
I seem to remember him missing two chances. One against West Ham and the other versus Leichester.

I forgive him though for those chances and hope he comes good real soon as in before and during the Chelsea and City games so that he can cause them headaches. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1931~~~
One chance a game is not people setting him up imo. And he created his chance vs Leicester.

1932~~~
I'm not saying he did, it was a general comment on the validity of information that journalists are made privy to.

1933~~~
No, Rooney's created that chance for him, he was in the open and Rooney's ball was inch perfect. Pity about the bar.

Your words were

Rooney certainly set him up there. As a striker, you have to take all those chances, even if it's one chance.

1934~~~
Showing some really good hold up play so far while being very willing, as said in this thread, to set others up. The goals will come; he gets into all the right positions and isn't afraid to have a go from range. 
Has been rather subdued given his record for scoring; can't wait for him to burst into life.

1935~~~
Fair enough, I don't disagree with that statement, but did that get in the papers?  See what I mean?  If the club was feeding info to journalists it would be so it gets published, surely?

1936~~~
Im wondering if he was bought more for hold up and assists for VP than   goal scoring, he seems to be playing deeper than usual.

1937~~~
Put your house on him to score against Everton.

You heard it here first!

1938~~~
I put money on him scoring vs QPR, then against Leicester, then against West Ham, so I have to carry on until he does, he was Evens the last 2 times, hes gone out to 2.4 now though, hopefully easy money <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1939~~~
His goal return won't be as ridiculous as it was in Spain, but he'll score goals. He's only had a few half chances so far.

1940~~~
That doesn't make much sense - no striker has a 100% conversion rate. Rooney missed one and scored one in the half vs West Ham - should he have scored twice? RvP missed several vs Sunderland(?). No one has a 100%. If ppl aren't making more than 1 chance a game for Falcao it's highly likely he won't score - even in a game you need a rhythm be it shooting, etc and only having 1-2 chances prevents that. Falcao had one - two proper chances per game the last 3 matches because he's being forced to do a lot if not all of the hold up play and leg work, while RvP goal hangs and Rooney stays further back to get the result of the hold up play. Falcao is basically playing as a 2nd striker (hence being able to get 2 assists, one each game). Rooney has benefited as the pseudo #10 - scoring by running in late (as Mata was doing also when he plays).

My point was we need a system (or performance in this system) where all 3 forwards benefit so that all remain confident and productive. ATM largely because RvP isn't doing much running the system's benefits are lopsided wrt the 3 forwards. It will be better if all 3 are scoring than just one or two, and that depends on more being created for the guy who has been creating lately.

1941~~~
Yeap,I think he will score against them also this weekend.

1942~~~
He doesn't look like the clinical finisher i thought he was.

1943~~~
He's the best finisher in the world(bar Messi) when he gets going. He will get going. Don't worry.

1944~~~
That's been my thinking. If I hadn't seen any of his goal comps and know his general stats, I'd think of him as a fairly clumsy finisher.

1945~~~
Let's hope you're right!

1946~~~
Falcao!!!!!!

1947~~~
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS made up for him!

1948~~~
Forget a money off the back, that must feel like a gorilla off the back.

1949~~~
Jinxed it!

1950~~~
He reminds me so much of van Nistelrooy

1951~~~
Let's try to do an anti-jinx again:

One goal's all well and good, but with the kind of chances he's getting and wasting, I wouldn't trust this guy to nab two in one outing.

1952~~~

1953~~~
Loving his attitude

1954~~~
Should hopefully start banging them in now he's got his first.

1955~~~
Muppet seaman all over the world as that goal went in?

1956~~~
Nice one Rommy, still a few left to catch up though.

Falcao 1 - 4 Welbeck

<span style="color: #ffffff">white text </span>

1957~~~
Excellent hold up play today.

1958~~~
I actually thought this was his worst match for us. Yet he scored.

1959~~~
Missed the part during his sub., why was he taken off? Was he injured?

1960~~~
The clumsy finishing I think was down to him being over anxious to score.

Glad he scored, celebrating a Falcao goal for United is weird though. Never thought we would have him.

Love his attitude as well.

1961~~~
Could really work on his finishing, I'll put it down to him trying too hard to get his first goal for now. Though I do think RVP had a worse game than him.

1962~~~
I'd say it's because he's still not fully fit and LVG doesn't want to risk further injuries.

1963~~~
Most of the chances he got were actually kind of awkward so I don't blame him too much for not finishing them, although with his ability you'd expect him to. He scored with the best chance he got and it was a great finish

1964~~~
Ah ok. Just wanted to know if there was any apparent reason to take him off. Looks like there wasn't. 

Hopefully he starts banging them in now that he's got his first.

1965~~~
Fantastic finish, and his passion after the goal was beautiful to see.

But I have to be honest, he doesn't look all that.

1966~~~
You could see what the goal meant to him, he was getting in great positions but snatching at the chances, now he's scored I think he'll grow back into the monster striker we know he is.

1967~~~
First of many goals for our lethal columbian!

1968~~~
Was pretty wasteful up until the goal but wow what a relief. Felt so good seeing him grab his first goal for us at such a vital time too. Great instincts.

1969~~~
Goal aside, he was not exactly clinical today, but hopefully that will take off some of the pressure.

1970~~~
It would have been interesting to see him get another chance after his goal, to see how confidence would affect his execution.

1971~~~
The way he slid on his knees celebrating that goal tells me he isn't worried about it and is playing pain free.

1972~~~
Get the feck in, delighted he scored, looked over anxious to get that first goal.

1973~~~

Still can't believe this happened. Falcao and Di Maria in a Manchester United shirt. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1974~~~
He's getting sharper all the time, and could have had 3 or 4 today. Just need him and van persie to get a better partnership going. At the moment they're both waiting for the ball to come into the box.

1975~~~
Great to see him on the scoresheet, but he was shit today.

1976~~~
Missed chances he should have taken but I will let him off a) because he scored the winner and b) because after he scored you could see him visibly relax. The pressure of getting that first goal was clearly the reason why he kept snatching at the chances he had before he scored. I reckon now Falcao's off the mark he'll go on a nice run of goalscoring.

1977~~~
You could see the sense of relief after he scored . Even for a seasoned goal scorer like him. Getting your first goal at OT meant so much.

1978~~~
You could see the relief when he scored, snatched at a couple of chances but that happens when you are anxious to score your first.

This will lead to more.

Snap <a class="username" data-user="8198, @Drifter" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/8198/">@Drifter</a>

1979~~~
I have to admit I'm not impressed so far, his positioning is so brilliant he should have had 2-3 goals each game he's played but he's been terribly wasteful and not even remotely looking like he'll hit the target, hope its not another case of Torres.

Having said that he did score the winner today so hopefully that he's over that first hill it'll spark him into previous form. One thing I noticed is he grabbed his jersey after scoring, he genuinely looks very happy to be an United player, which is always a massive positive.

1980~~~
Nice to see Handsome Tevez off and running. Goal was-gulp-Forlanesque...

1981~~~
Glad he scored. Hopefully this pushes him on a bit and he can start burying chances. Looked better than RvP I thought.

1982~~~
It's understandable that it will take some time until he's 100% but his movement was just incredible today. A 100% match sharp Falcao would have got a hat trick today.

1983~~~
Loved his celebration when he grabbed the shirt. Can't find a gif yet.

1984~~~
Isn't it obvious that because he has missed a lot of chances before scoring that tap-in?Welbeck would be buried to death in here it it was him.

1985~~~
The best strikers can have the shittest of days and still manage to grab a goal, even more importantly get the winning goal. Watch the floodgates open now.

1986~~~
What are these glut of missed chances everyone's chatting about? The header in the first half that was actually a very good effort? The full volley at waist heigh from a strongly hit corner that Van Basten would've struggled to score?  That snatched shot early in the 2nd that was his only really wasteful effort...And? What?

He was perfectly fine today. Positionally brilliant but still a little rusty and nervy. He'll be fine now. Providing of course he doesn't get taken off on the hour mark every week to accomodate the indulgence of RVP.

1987~~~
I'd much rather we just dropped RVP and let Falcao play as a central no.9 where I think he'd look consistently more dangerous, rather than in a balanced front 2 where he has to work the channels. Play Rooney with him in a floating forward role with Mata No.10, or Januzaj as the floating forward and Rooney No.10 if LVG is being obtuse.

1988~~~
Looked sharp again today, typical poachers goal as well.. hopefully that's just the start now.

1989~~~
Very happy he scored.  However, his honeymoon period is coming to a close.  He needs to get match sharpness and start taking some of these chances that are falling to his feet.  Sorry, but when you earn that much you don't get excuses and too much time.

1990~~~
His movement is insane and as a result will always lead to plenty of chances. Today was a day when he got lots of them wrong but when he's in full flow he'll be a machine.

1991~~~
Delighted he got his first, hopefully the floodgates will now open. Works hard and has very good hold up play, was just lacking in a bit of confidence. 
His dribbling under pressure is the one thing that has surprised me so far though, a lot better then what I remembered from him in that respect.

1992~~~
Exactly! And when United click properly, well it's just a frightening prospect.

1993~~~
A bit of confidence will fix that.

1994~~~
What a ridiculous headline.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://metro.co.uk/2014/10/05/radamel-falcao-scores-ridiculously-lucky-first-goal-for-manchester-united-after-angel-di-maria-mis-hit-shot-4893271/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://metro.co.uk/2014/10/05/radam...ed-after-angel-di-maria-mis-hit-shot-4893271/</a>

1995~~~
LOLOLOLO Falcaooooooo! Wow this is a surreal feeling. Radamel fecking Falcao scored for Manchester United and this isnt the last time you'll hear that.

1996~~~
Yup, he is always getting into good positions, and for a striker of his class, that is most important. He's not going to forget how to score, so it's only a matter of time before he starts banging them in. A lot of people only see the chances he missed, but fail to notice the good work he does the majority of time he's on the pitch.

1997~~~
1 goal and 2 assists in something like 200 minutes is not shabby at all. He's increasing in his sharpness and whilst he was fairly wasteful, he should go on to score a lot more. He looks a lot more capable in build-up play than van Persie has recently, which is surprising.

1998~~~
This. It's his bloody brilliant movement that fools you into believing that he's missed a glut of chances.

1999~~~
Ridiculous lucky? I would like that journalist to try and chip the keeper at full stretch. That was a class finish.

2000~~~
If you hadn't seen the game, you'd think he'd missed 3 tap ins.

2001~~~
His movement today was fantastic.

He was getting more confident after his goal but LVG took him off. Guess not fully fit for 90.

2002~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2003~~~
You think he's looked anything other then decent in his first 4 games?

Look, I'm not saying he's been shit. But considering his reputation, I've been underwhelmed.

2004~~~
Extremely happy for him. He genuinely looks like he loves playing for us. The similarity with Forlán is a bit uncanny but let's hope Falcao actually shows his true form in a United shirt.

2005~~~
I will add, his movement for the goal today was fantastic.

2006~~~
FFS its obvious he's going to score hatfuls of goals for us. 

Hes coming back from a cruciate ligament injury and see still looks sharper than RVP. Have some patience

2007~~~
Love his song, it's infectious! 

He was good today, should have stayed on the full 90 and RvP should have gone off. 

Did he Tebow as well? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2008~~~
Think he just needed that first goal. Expecting a lot more from him now, especially if we get defenders back and get a bit more settled defensively which I think will lead to more chances. Outside of the ball his hold up play has been really good and he just hasn't had the luck in front of goal.

2009~~~
Glad he got his goal, hopefully it'll be the start of an avalanche.

Was weak defensively but I guess he can't be perfect.

2010~~~
Desperately needed that goal and it should surely lead to more now. The most encouraging signs for me are his movement inside the box and the way the ball seems to be attracted to him. It's like he's always gonna be on the end of everything we fire that way. His hold up play is better than I first thought and he's already proved he can create for others. So we should expect him to show that ruthless finishing instinct he's famous for in time. There was a bit too much anxiety in his attempts before that goal.

2011~~~
Hopefully now he can relax, seemed to be anxious to get his first. Delighted he scored today.

2012~~~
He did kick the ball off the line though

2013~~~
He's done everything but score a bucket of goals, which he'd have by now if we're talking about the Falcao of his Atletico days. He's getting into all the right positions and I think that goal today will kick him off.

2014~~~
Do you not see what so many are seeing? His movement is absolutely brilliant. The little things he does go unnoticed. So you have to watch him more closely mate. He scored 1 and assisted 2 in three games and one 15 minute sub appearance. Dont think thats terrible to be honest.

2015~~~
I've actually been more impressed with his work outside the box, then in it, so far. He was snatching at chances today, which is strange, as I thought he was a supposedly a very calm finisher. 

And thats my concern, that he's not that Falcao anymore.

2016~~~
Snatched at a couple but the goal should help his confidence. 

Was it me or did he look completely out of gas in the second half?

2017~~~
Thought we were playing Bebe up front the way he was snatching at shots today, so I was mightily relieved when he netted what will hopefully become the first of many now.

2018~~~
He wasnt though. He didnt have any clear cut chances per say. The header wasnt really a chance. The one where he took it with his left and deflected was kinda but he was off balance. If he had the scored the volley at that pace and at that height, that would have one of the best goals in the premier league. But the important thing is he took the one that was.

2019~~~
He's playing for a real big club for the first time in his career. I reckon nerves have gotten to him a fair bit. Way too early to say that he's not the old Falcao, way too early.

2020~~~
Not just for his goal. He was constantly getting in good positions. Hopefully his goal will settle some nerves in front of goal. I'm confident that if the exact same game is played in a couple of months time, he'll be walking away with the match ball.

2021~~~
First half he looked like a striker that was trying too hard to get his first goal. It's off his back now, I think he will just get better and better.

Movement in the box is excellent, textbook.

2022~~~
Happy for him to finally get the goal he needed, and a very important one at that, too.

2023~~~
Just look at the way he celebrated his goal it was clear he was really nervous and worried about it. From what we've seen so far his movement is great and hold up play also very good. I think and hope that he will turn into a proper goal machine for us any game now, the weight is off his shoulders.

2024~~~
Jesus give the man a chance. As has been pointed out already he is just coming back from a serious injury. It will take time but this is still the Falcao from his Athletico days.

2025~~~
glad he got the monkey off his back now as he was just scuffing his chances early on.

the first of many hopefully.

btw is he still a few games away from being able to complete 90 minutes or what?

2026~~~
He looks like he isn't fully integrated due to several reasons. Back to weekly football after a serious injury, new club and I think more important, to a new role with two strikers up front. 

We have seen glimpses of the player he can be, but that's not the Falcao we have seen the last years. But you have to give him credit for being productive. Two assists and one goal from three starts is not bad at all, even though there is room for improvement performance wise. The goal today should take some pressure of him and he looked really relieved afterwards. He has shown some great movement in terms of anticipating shots/passes or rebounds and always looks like he is one step ahead of the defenders, which shows his class as a striker. 

But nevertheless, he should have scored two goals today.

2027~~~
I think hes still struggling to keep up with the pace of the PL, last week and this week he seems out of gas around the 60th minute mark. But hes not had much football since his injury and i dont think the French league is the most competitive.

Still his movement, holdup and link play is good. Finishing could be better but im sure that will improve as he plays more games

2028~~~
A case of the 'Forlan's' was quickly closing in on him. He does more than score goals too.

2029~~~
I'm not sure, I think it's a combination of us both being cautious and him not being completely at the races just yet.

2030~~~
Guy in the pub today compared him unfavourably to Forlan. He said even when Forlan was missing chances he was still doing good stuff with the ball. I gave him a dismissive glare.

Edit: Just seen your post <a class="username" data-user="54198, @Yorkeontop" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/54198/">@Yorkeontop</a> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2031~~~
We do seem to be playing him a lot deeper then I expected, maybe thats hindering him a bit?

2032~~~
Very happy for him, hopes he goes on a goalscoring run now. He's an absolute beast of a player when in top form.

2033~~~
Glad he finally got his goal. Just looked so anxious every time the ball dropped to him in the box but hopefully the goal will help him get some confidence back as he is a quality striker.

2034~~~
I've been cut off civilization during September so this was the first game I've seen in ages and the first one with Falcao. Thought he was excellent, his movement is brilliant and he always manages to stay onside. I think he's still adapting to not being the sole #9 up front but I thought he was very useful and pressed intelligently. He'll score bucketloads for us, I'm sure of it.

2035~~~
Always looked threatening in today's game and deserved to get his goal. Proper poachers goal too. Hope he can go on a run now.

2036~~~
Glad he finally popped one in.

Clearly <a class="username" data-user="49797, @Rooney in Dublin" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49797/">@Rooney in Dublin</a> is his lucky charm, keep fecking watching......

2037~~~

2038~~~
Did anyone see Herrera's tweet with a pic of the lads in the changing room? Seemed quite obvious that Falcao was covering his knees with a jacket.

2039~~~
came close a couple of times and finally got one...a massive one. hope it leads to 20 more this season.

2040~~~
His celebration was excellent. What a huge relief for him and the fans.

2041~~~
Really happy that he scored - would have gone down as a completely terrible performance otherwise! Was trying far too hard to force things, so I reckon that goal will do wonders for him and settle things down.

2042~~~
Glad that he scored, but he cant miss such chances everytime, a world class striker in form would get a hat trick today.

2043~~~
No more holidays planned for a while, I'm ready to serve!

2044~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> That's what I like to hear!

2045~~~
Very very pleased to see him get his first goal today! Also, it is plain obvious to see that he's going to be top class for us once he's fully match fit and integrated into the team.

2046~~~
This can't come soon enough!

2047~~~

2048~~~
I was a bit gutted seeing him substituted but i feel his match time needs to be limited where ever possible to reduce the risk of damaging his knee.

The premiership is a hard league and like Herrera has shown it is easy to pick up injuries.

Happy he scored today and loved his celebration...wrap him in cotton wool until the next match.

2049~~~
Still doesn't look 100 percent up to pace.

But he sure knows how to get on the end of things. Now he's broken the deadlock I expect him to start put chances away.

2050~~~
The twitter pic is not really conclusive...what is more noticeable is Rojo is complete naked while everyone else is still in the kit. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2051~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I think his knee probably has a few bandages on it. Par for the course though given the nature of his injury.

2052~~~
He's just hiding the bell of a monster boner.

2053~~~
Hispanic team.

2054~~~
His movement is incredible.

2055~~~
His finishing hasn't been what we all know it can be, so far. But his movement and the positions that he gets into are just top class. Once he finds his scoring touch, he is going to be lethal.

2056~~~
De Gea and Rafael are missing.

2057~~~

2058~~~
Just found out his celebration was in honour of his idol, Marcelo Salas.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://estaticos01.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/imagenes/2008/11/28/1227898360_0.jpg" src="http://estaticos01.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/imagenes/2008/11/28/1227898360_0.jpg"/> <img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzMYPbdIcAACgLT.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzMYPbdIcAACgLT.jpg"/>

2059~~~
Salas! That fecker! He was supposed to join before going to Lazio years ago.

2060~~~
Delighted for him that he is off the mark.

He is clearly still rusty. There was a few scuffed chances that he probably would have buried when he was at Atletico. But he does get himself in them positions. Give him a few more weeks and I think he will be banging them in left right and center.

2061~~~
Yeah happy for him today. Like all sportsmen (and women), they need confidence. Even great stars like Federer for e.g. can lose their confidence due to injuries etc. Once they recover, it can take some time to get up to speed and they usually need that catalyst to get going again. Reckon today was Falcao's - he needed that goal. The longer he went without one the more anxious he would become. So pleased for him today. Shame we don't have CL (and the league cup) where he could get some more playing time and get the goalscoring up to speed.

2062~~~
Was that a smile from Valencia? .

2063~~~
Photoshop.

2064~~~
Breakthrough goal but still a long road to Radamel Falcao, the best striker in the world.

Good signs in his game today. Lots of hunger for football. He'll be fine.

2065~~~
He looks like he's gonna score an absolute cnut load for us. His movement is incredible.

2066~~~
The instinct for his goal was ridiculous, already in movement before the shot.

2067~~~
His attitude is brilliant. He didn't have the best of first halves tbh but what I like is he just kept going. And he was in the right place at two crucial moments. Once he clicks properly it's going to be great.

2068~~~
Just get him up top on his own in a 4-3-3 or partner him with Rooney, and I think he'll improve, as will the side as a whole.

2069~~~
Glad he got off the mark, you could sense his finishing clearly suffer from the anxiety. Also impressed by the amount of defensive work he puts in game after game for a true superstar player.

2070~~~
This with Januzaj and Di Maria as inside forwards he will score a bucket load. I think the team as a whole will be more solid if we just did that and that is more important than placating egos. Rooney to play the role he played for Hernandez in 2011 and I think his hunger has returned enough for him to be successful there.

2071~~~
He must be feeling incredibly confident about his knee (or just forgot about it) to do the knee slide for his celebration by the way. Though I'm not sure what he used for his acl as that could make a difference. I'm only at 3 months since mine but I wouldn't dream of doing a knee slide ever again after my surgery <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2072~~~
Needs to play as number 9. No point in signing him if you're not gonna have him leading the line as THE number 9.

Also, that twitter pic is definitely a bit fishy. He just has a vibe in his movement of not being totally fit, he just looks a little withdrawn in his movement and almost a little pained at times. Maybe it's just his general facial expression, I dunno.

I'd be very, very wary of signing him permanently though unless he's been an absolute beast for the second half of the season.

2073~~~
That's iconic. 


LO LO LLLOOO! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

He's done a bloomin' good job. He puts the ball in the net <i>exactly </i>like him. 
These finishes could easily be Falcao's.

2075~~~
I doubt he'd have slid on his knees in celebration if he had any concern about them.

2076~~~
I'm not getting the issue with that twitter picture? He had a hoody over him, so what? We've seen plenty pictures of his knees.

2077~~~
Same here. It's pretty strange. I guess people are just being paranoid.

2078~~~
This. Its like people are trying to  force it talking constantly about movement and hold up play, what he was world class at was scoring from everywhere.. Hes still a good player but he doesnt look anything like he did at Atletico so far, and has cost me a lot of money up until today on scorer bets!

2079~~~
Every cloud, then..

2080~~~
Nah, he was Tebowing.

2081~~~
Yeah he won me a packet today <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>I was getting so frustrated at his constant misses though.

2082~~~
Great to get off the mark. I was getting that Forlan feeling with Falcao, I could just see it going longer and longer but glad he finally got the goal.

2083~~~
The positive note people don't seem to be noting is how good he's looked outside of the box for us. Sure he was signed on the premise of scoring a shit load of goals but his link up and hold up were not skills people ever really talked about, it was his ability to find space, his heading and his shooting which won plaudits. 

I've really warmed to the guy, he's a proper forward. I think the goals will start to flow in time. He could've had a hat trick today and he probably would have scored all 5 18 months ago.

2084~~~
It clearly meant a lot to him to get his first goal for us. Glad he's got it, I'm sure they'll start flowing now.

2085~~~
I also noticed he blocks the space for opposing players i.e blocks the passing space and creates pressure on that player with the ball. He is a very intelligent footballer.

2086~~~
He really was in the verge of tears when he scored, so pleased for him. He'll be a brilliant center forward for us. His movement inside the box is just unreal.

2087~~~
He probably had an ice pack taped over his knee. I think it's precautionary.

2088~~~
So delighted for him that he's gotten his first goal. What a player.

He'll be so much more relaxed now.

2089~~~
Im all about work ethic and all and the boy has it in abundance,but i think like how we utilised ruud,just make him the scoring point.Focus on torturing in between centrebacks not either side of them, and let him burst to life in the box,especially now we are looking creative.

VanP is custom made as a nine and half to capitalise on the space Radamel will create.


------------Falcao--------------
------------VanP----------------
---Dimaria-------------Mata---
-------Blind--------Herrera-----

2090~~~
Love the way he celebrated the goal, so much passion

2091~~~
The tiger is loose and the falcon is in flight!

2092~~~
He's basically just a more expensive Chicharito...

2093~~~
And one with better movement,finishing, heading, hold up play, dribbling, passing, crossing, long range shots... Virtually everything, apart from pace. He's a complete striker he just needed his first today to get him started.

2094~~~
Agree with this. Reminds me of Batistuta.

2095~~~
He is clearly a good striker. His movement is first class. I don't think he has looked worthy of the money so far though. If he finds his best form then probably, and hopefully that comes soon.

2096~~~
I was in the toilets at the pub when Falcao scored, but when I heard the sheer intensity of the cheers I knew it had to be him.

Looking forward to many more.

2097~~~
Force what, exactly?

To be honest, I don't always notice subtleties of the game until it's one of Utd's players in action, as I don't necessarily watch with such an attentive eye. I've watched Falcao quite a lot before he joined Utd and yes, the stand out aspect of his game is definitely his finishing as it's freakishly good with any part of his body. However, as I said, yesterday was the first time I watched him play for Utd and I was happy he scored, but I was more impressed by his overall play. Seriously, the lead up to his goal, he's constantly moving, just dropping off his defender, and making the run at the exact right moment. In other moments of the game, during an attacking moment, he's capable of making 2 or 3 different runs in a few seconds. And another impressive thing is how well he manages to stay onside. 

It's also reassuring, because having that level of workrate and that instinct garanties goals in the long run. 

I also hadn't noticed the quality of Van Persie's movement before he joined us by the way, and it's a very important aspect of his game (though it's a tad different to the way Falcao moves up front, which I'd say is more dynamic). 

I don't think anyone is 'forcing' anything (and I don't even know what that means), we're just looking into his game with a lot of scrutiny. 

I'm not judging his previous games by the way, as I haven't watched them, I'm just saying yesterday's game showed some truly world class aspects to his game, the only really disappointing part being when he fluffed the chance after Shaw's excellent run. But those can happen, look at Costa's miss yesterday (even though he was offside).

2098~~~
He hasn't scored for me on FM yet...hopefully the jinx is broken! Love him already.

2099~~~
The goal will give him the needed relaxed feeling in games now and I'm sure he will only get better. I'd prefer to have him upfront with Rooney behind though - I just feel RVP is not bringing the best out of our team atm

2100~~~
'kinell <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2101~~~
Really happy he got his first goal. He can now kick on. I'd like to see a combo of

Falcao-Rooney
---Mata---

RvP looks lost at times

2102~~~
Love the passion this guy plays with, kinda reminds me of Rafael.

2103~~~
Hah! Was gonna post more or less exactly that.

Although I would have replaced "expensive" with "better".

Because his arrival meant the end of Welbeck, he was always seen as an upgrade on Danny but a much better way to look at this is as a big improvement on Hernandez. Interestingly, Chicharito and RvP were never much good together but he formed a great partnership with Rooney for a while. I'd really like to see Rooney and Falcao up top with Mata at 10. Seeing as Van Gaal seems to see his fellow Dutch man as undroppable, I might be waiting some time to see this. Which is a pity.

2104~~~
Falcao's all round game is superior to Hernandez's by considerable margin. He is a world class player, Chicharito is a good player.

2105~~~
Which was my point.

2106~~~
Agree. Ronaldo is also just a more expensive Nani.

2107~~~
Never wanted anyone to score his first more than him. He seems a genuinly nice guy and reliant on confidence, looked disappointed to be subbed.

2108~~~
Hadn't thought this before but think you're spot-on.

2109~~~
We could do with him getting a couple against West Brom ahead of the Chelsea game. Him going into that game on top form, especially considering what he did to them last time he faced them would have them shitting themselves. He will also feel he can score agaisnt them after his last hat-trick agains the same opposition.

2110~~~
His movement in the box is top class.

2111~~~
His movement outside the box is very good too.

2112~~~
Well he'll know the only reason he's being subbed is to preserve his knee. We're not going to run him ragged every game for a good six months.

2113~~~
A big part of that hold up play is the awesome strength he possesses. He's a really strong lad.

2114~~~

2115~~~
I actually thought this was his worst performance for us so far ironically. He worked his socks off but his touch and finishing were poor, actually looked like he was trying to hard, was reminding me of Forlan. Was encouraging he got off the mark as he is a great player. What encourage me most though was that he got so many chances, not down to him inproving but due to his team mates actually starting to notice his runs now and also RVP getting a little bit more of an understanding, one attacked the from post and the other the back post.

2116~~~
Little bit harsh there! As an out and out striker like he is, he did pretty much everything right. Held up the ball and laid it off when needed, provided excellent movement in and around the box, scored, got into numerous scoring positions. I will say that he should've taken at least 2 more goals. Those misses could've cost us.

2117~~~
He was desperate to score yesterday, he took some wild shots at goal and could easily of had a hattrick by halftime. Hopefully this goal will make him relax a bit so we can all see the real Falcao.

2118~~~
Yeah I think he will definitely end up being a big improvement on Chicharito in the long run but up until this point I really can't help but just think Chicharito when I watch him play. We've seen Chicharito put in performances exactly like Falcao's yesterday countless times, always in the right place, making great runs, fluffing tons of chances and then finally burying one that ends up making the difference. Though I expect Falcao will prove to be far more clinical soon enough.

And I agree, I'd love to see Falcao - Rooney with Mata behind them.

2119~~~
This is very much something I want to see.

Not least because RvP has been shite for a while now, and Rooney up front with Mata behind makes better use of each of them.

2120~~~
Those 3 would also allow us to keep the work rate of Rooney that so many are worried about losing with Mata as a 10 as well, I hope we get to see it when Rooney comes back.

2121~~~
He has set up RvP for 2 goals I think. So the partnership is working alright from Falcao's end.

2122~~~
When you think about it he combines the best attributes from our 4 strikers last season;

RVP's finishing in 11/12
Rooney's heading in 09/10
Chicarito's movement in 09/10
Welbeck's awesome hair

2123~~~
He's not as big as Robin for example but he's as strong as an ox or some other cloven-hooved. It's amazing how good his first touch is and how he manages to defend the ball from attacking defenders.

2124~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2125~~~
Yesterday was the first game really where he actually had any clear cut chances, i mean he hit the bar in the last game but he hadn't really had any clear chances or shots before yesterday which is strange with the way we are playing at the moment.

Anyway i hope we see Falcao and Rooney up top with Mata or Januzaj behind, maybe even DiMaria when Carrick comes back. The less we see of Van persie the better at the moment for me.

2126~~~
I think the Falcao/Hernandez comparisons are actually quite apt, judging from his first four games for us. 

People need to start talking about the current Falcao, and judging him on current performances, not going on about a player from 2 years ago. It just sounds a bit desperate.

2127~~~
But you have to keep in mind that Falcao have been performing on a level that Hernandez never have. Sure, he might never be the player he once was, but hopefully that goal will releave some of the pressure. You could easily see he was desperate for a goal yesterday

2128~~~
So far I just see a lot of straw clutching about a player that was amazing 2 years ago. So far, we haven't seen anything close to that. Is that to say he won't ever be that player again? Of course not, none of us know. But I'd rather evaluate the performances he has given, rather then the ones he might sometime in the future.

2129~~~
He's still a new player though, who will be adjusting to the league and settling into the a new side. Not to make lots of excuses for him, but he's ultimately only played a few games for us and can only be partly judged based on that. If he doesn't look particularly great come January then you'd have a point, but I think it's way too early to begin saying that the "current" Falcao is the type of player he really is.

2130~~~
That doesn't seem to be a problem for the likes of Costa, Di Maria and Herrera. I just think people are seeing what they want to see because he's a muppet signing.

Look, don't get me wrong, I love him passion and the joy he showed after scoring, and I desperately want him to be amazing for us. The thought of having the 2012 Falcao playing for us is unbelievably exciting. But I'm just calling it as I see it, and thats that he's been a bit meh for us so far. The way he was shanking shots yesterday was the kind of thing that Welbeck/Hernandez used to get slaughtered on here for, but because its Radamel Falcao its just ignored.

2131~~~
The Hernandez comparisons are meant as a compliment! They were from me anyway.

Chicarito's movement in the box in his first season was absolutely sensational. It's rare to find strikers with such a natural gift for finding space in a crowded box and it's incredibly valuable. Gary Lineker made a bloody good career based on having that one attribute and not a lot else, ditto Inzaghi.

Falcao does seem to have a bit more in his locker, though, which we've seen with his two assists and generally decent hold up play. So long as he keeps getting on the end of stuff in and around the six yard box, though, he'll score a lot of goals for us.

2132~~~
People are rightly giving him some breathing space which is pretty standard for a new player. He's recently getting over a major injury so you can expect some rustiness, and therefore some improvement too. I'm enjoying the optimism around him personally, it makes a change from the constant whinging about the other players.

2133~~~
2 assists, 1 goal in 3 matches when he didn't play full minutes in all 3. So practically, if you combine the minutes he played, it's almost 2 full matches. That's not good enough for you? I get the feeling you expect Falcao to score goals like Ronaldo...

2134~~~

Look how delighted he was. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2135~~~
Bit douchy of him to taunt Jagielka like that.  <span style="color: #ffffff">Bants.</span>

2136~~~
He's stronger than RVP on the ball. You will rarely see Falcao get pushed off the ball. RVP moves tippy toed so he's susceptible to losing possession, Falcao has just enough Centre of gravity to stave off physical defenders.

2137~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2138~~~
He's still been fairly good though, hasn't he? Perhaps not as good as someone like Costa, but his performances overall have been decent and he's managed to grab a goal now as well. For a new player, I'd say that's a decent start.

2139~~~
Two years ago?? What are you on about? He's only been at Monaco one year. He ended at Athletico in May last year and scores 28 goals. He then scored 11 in 20 for Monaco before getting injured for 6 months. Stop exaggerating.

2140~~~
He has come out of a piss weak league and half a season out injured, he is going to be rusty.

It's his own fault, he shouldn't of been anywhere near the french league.

2141~~~
It wasn't out of choice, he had to move to Monaco because he was sold to them by the fund that brought him to Atletico in the first place. He's probably relieved to finally be at one of the top 5 biggest clubs in Europe.

2142~~~
He was checking to see if he was offside. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2143~~~
We would all love to see that 

Shame we won't ever see that because It appears RVP is exempt from being dropped <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

2144~~~
I agree with a fair bit of what you're saying in this thread. I think his goal has saved him from a bit of a hiding, because if we're all honest, his football has been underwhelming and his finishing a tad rusty. He's clearly a good player with outrageously good movement, but I've nothing special elsewhere as of yet. Still lots of time, however, and I trust he'll do very well here. I have flickers of Andriy Shevchenko in the back of my head and I hope he removes them as soon as possible.

2145~~~
Sure he missed a few chances and wasnt special but his football wasnt underwhelming, it was very good. More to follow I'm sure.

2146~~~
His play has actually been better than I thought it would be in general. Having rarely watched him, I've been pleasantly surprised by his all round play given that he is usually described as a lethal finisher and not a lot else. The turn and cross he set up RVP with was magic, really intelligent and brilliantly executed.

2147~~~
True. He's had good moments and his hold up play is good but I think I'd still expect more from a player that could well cost over £40 million come the summer. As you say, though, I'm sure more will follow, definitely.

2148~~~
Early days, I saw glimpses of a very good if not brilliant player as he used to be. 

No reason to call him new Shevcenko or compare him to Welbeck or Chicharito. And he did come back form an injury so comparisons with Herrera, Costa and Di Maria arent precise too. I dont mean you said all that, other posters did so I just added. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2149~~~
Thats basically my issue. Right now, he doesn't look like a player that should cost anything near that amount.

I'm not saying that wont change, just saying that as of right now, thats how it is.

Costa's been on/off injured ever since the end of last season. According to Mouriniho he's barely able to train inbetween matches. Doesn't seem to be holding him back does it?

2150~~~
He hasnt been so long off the field as Falcao as I know.

Some people seem to be a bit impatient. 3 games and he's a flop, he's meh and whatnot.

And as far as I know we didnt pay him 40 mil., he's currently on loan for 16.

2151~~~
Where have I said he's a flop?

2152~~~
Did I say you said it? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2153~~~
You've implied that its been said, and tbh I don't think anyone has said that on here.

2154~~~
I didnt say it was said here too. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> 

But I stay with my statement about people being impatient.

2155~~~
Shevchenko's a great comparison. I'm wholly unconvinced at the moment and I think people are clutching at straws when they talk about his all round contribution outside of the goals because it's been fine but nothing special. The team is nowhere near top form and we're still trying to find the right attacking combinations so it wouldn't be a massive surprise to see him kick it up a couple of notches,  but so far he's doing the bare minimum to stay in the team. People talking about him playing well are doing him a disservice because he was genuinely world class at Atletico and has been nowhere near that thus far.

2156~~~
Basically, this.

2157~~~
Christ. He's played barely 200 minutes of football for us.

He's in a new team, in a new League and working his way back to match fitness. What were you expecting?

2158~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ejdYtJWXLzw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2159~~~
This. People were expecting miracles judging by the reactions on here. Imagine if he hadn't hit the crossbar against Leicester. He would have scored a wonder goal and everyone would be saying what an amazing player he is. Give him time.

2160~~~
Most players require time to adjust to a new life in England both on and off the pitch. He came here with no preseason and is now suddenly in our starting 11, getting used to players he's never played with before.

However, I don't think there's any question that he's our number 1 striker now and if we play any system that requires just the one up front, he has to be it.

2161~~~
I wake up in the morning, thanking the footballing gods that he some how ended up at United. He will be world class for us, just as he was at Atletico. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2162~~~
Apparently Falcao should have scored 5 goals by now to not be a flop. He has contributed to 3 goals in 200 or so minutes in his first year in PL football after a long recovery from injury. Give him time before you come to conclusions.

2163~~~
Exactly. I don't get what you guys are expecting. Ronaldo's goal output or something? Falcao has been substituted in all of the matches that he has played and he still managed to assist two goals and score one. If you expected him to score like Messi or Ronaldo, then prepare to be dissapointed. 

IMO, considering he just came from a serious injury, in a new team and hasn't even played a full match yet, he has done very good.

2164~~~
Tbh one of my main complaints with Van Persie in his first two seasons that sometimes he would shank shots and miss sitters, before he actually scored. I think watching Costa the other week he was similar. The difference is they have the mental strength to keep going. I think, as Van Gaal said, he's probably trying a bit to hard to get that first goal. 

Secondly, as pointed out on match of the day, both Van Persie and Falcao are both used to being the only number 9 in the squad. Sometimes it reduces space for both of them as they go for similar positions.

2165~~~
People criticising Falcao, u mad? Watch him smash in the winners v City and Chelsea.

2166~~~
Buying him will only make sense if we get rid of RvP but that doesn't seem likely to happen under van Gaal. I'm also not a big fan of paying so much money for a 29 year old. After the Berba deal our club actually decided not to spend so much money anymore on players that are 27+ years old and I actually think that's a wise decision. But let's see if he starts banging them in like there is no tomorrow and his health stays stable it might be worth reconsidering this stance.

2167~~~
Some of the striker's best sequences: 

MONACO

2013-2014: 7 goals in 7 games

ATLETICO MADRID

2012-2013: 13 in 8

2011-2012: 12 in 12

PORTO

2010-2011: 16 in 9

2009-2010: 8 in 9

2168~~~
This. The man has been good for someone just recovered from a cruciate injury. 1 goal 2 assists. Better than TV.

2169~~~
People really have no clue about who he is as a footballer if they complain about him shooting too much. If you look at the 70 goals he scored from Atletico, remove the penalties, then basically 60% are easy tap ins where he's played completely free, 35% are world class finishes from areas where "he was selfish if he shot" and 5% is more adventurous goals.

He'll shoot when there's some other option every now and then - but let him, that is what we bought him for. His only absolutely world class skill is his strength, goal poaching and finishing. Just let him shoot and be on his side, he's shown it works for him.

2170~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2171~~~
As long as RVP stays out of his zones he'll score.

2172~~~
Hope so!

2173~~~
How come he went unnoticed in all this time? I mean he came to Europe when he was 23. That's a bit late, isn't it. You would've thought that a player with his natural striker instinct and abilities would've been more wanted. Nevertheless, I'm so happy he's here now.

2174~~~
He has really caught the main public probably after his Europa league exploits with Porto. Your right 23 is a bit late but as soon as he set foot on Europe he was consistently scoring 20+ every season.
How can he be regarded as unnoticed, the prem is made of players being imported from the top European leagues. Therefore these players are known as they could be on the verge of playing in the Prem soon. He was wanted but everyone at the time didn't need a striker except for Chelsea. Falcao in 2012 was the best striker in the world, simple as that...

2175~~~
Oh, I can see I wasn't too clear on what I meant. What I meant by unnoticed was that no other club than Porto were scouting him while he was at River Plate. The same goes for Jackson Martinez. He came to Porto at the age 26 and he's been scoring for fun ever since. Even a legend like Batistuta was discovered a bit late. 

It just baffles me how a player like him didn't get more attention while he was playing in Argentina.

2176~~~
Just because you score 20 goals for River, it doesnt mean you will end up as a world beater. Di Maria ended up at Benfica too, thats the way it goes nowadays. It is also better for them to go to these clubs, to establish themselves first in a lower european league and then go to a top club. There was this 3rd party ownership thing too with Falcao and most of the other south american players have that too. I am sure someone knows more about it.

2177~~~
Costa is in a team performing at top capacity though, and it's all being set up to feed him chances. Look how many times Chelsea get the ball to him in the box this season. 

Di Maria and Herrera also play in different positions, so it's a difficult comparison there too. They will naturally be involved in a game far more than a box predator. 

Falcao is clearly rusty, but his movement is still excellent and that's key. He is finding pockets of space all over but we're just not spotting them as a team yet, and he's not always finishing them when we do. Once we get sorted and start getting the right balls in to him im sure he will come good. Its telling that none of our other established world class strikers are looking particularly world class at the moment either.

2178~~~
And you know this how?

2179~~~
Guess I was wrong about that. Just found these articles:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1083853/Radamel-Falcao-keen-great-Arsenal-favours-La-Liga-switch.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...een-great-Arsenal-favours-La-Liga-switch.html</a>

Linked to both Arsenal and Tottenham back in 2008. Was even dubbed the Colombian Rooney. Didn't recall any clubs being linked to him back then, tbh.

2180~~~
We we're linked to him too:

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/united-and-real-in-falcao-hunt.209442/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/united-and-real-in-falcao-hunt.209442/</a>

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/falcao.209617/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/falcao.209617/</a>

2181~~~
Oh I see, I get ya now. izec is right, the transition from south america to europe is huge and the best route tends to be via Portugal. I think he also had a bad injury there and maybe was a risk for clubs. The norm has changed now, players are coming over at 18-20 and really stalling. Jackson was a late one like you said. Sometimes it works sometimes or doesn't and I don't think it depends on how many you score before Europe either but Falcao made he right decision until moving to Monaco on his prime

2182~~~
Firstly, Costa didn't do his ACL. It's a completely different level of injury to Falcao. Costa's also come off the back of a great season with Atletico. And finally Costa's joined a Chelsea squad that is settled and firing on all cylinders. Compare that with our squad which is basically just learning how to play together. I don't think even with his pricetag, we should be expecting Ronaldo/Messi type numbers from him, even when he's fully on song. He'll come good, and if he ends up getting anywhere close to a goal a game in the EPL, he'll be worth the pricetag.

2183~~~
Sam is Falcao's doubting Thomas

2184~~~
I think Falcao will be far more productive if he's made the focal point of the team. This whole situation with him Rooney and RvP needs sorting as it isn't getting the best out of the three of them or the team when they're all playing together. I don't think LvG has any intention of it though as he spoke about Falcao and RvPs relationship improving recently and Rooney will be straight back in the team when he's available (and rightly so).

2185~~~
This. Play him as a 9 and watch him score a shit load. His movement inside the box is phenomenal.

2186~~~
We need him to have strong players behind him that can create all kind of changes. That is how you will see him strive and the good thing is, we're surely getting there

2187~~~
This is going to sound facetious,but the person to ask is Martin O'Neil.

He was offered Falcao, and chose to sign Heskey instead.

Now, regardless of how laughably inept that makes him look as a talent spotter, there must of been a thought process as to why he was not interested.

One of the criticisms of Falcao or should I say, one of his weaknesses, is that he does not play particularly well with his back to goal, he is 100% and out and goal scorer, and supposedly is not great with his build up play.
Perhaps for most managers, having someone who is just a complete goal machine regardless of how many they score, isnt enough.

2188~~~
I totally agree

we need to treat Falcao like we did Ronaldo or even RVP in his first season

now he's off the mark just watch him go - i can't wait to see his pace and movement unsettle the Chelsea defence

2189~~~
Ive heard that line of thought before but never bought into it.  Granted, we have seen little of him comparatively so far, however, one of the most impressive aspects of his performances so far have been how strong he is on the ball and ability to lay off to those around him.  Im not concerned one bit about his hold up play.

2190~~~
His pace is nothing special. He is pretty slow actually.

2191~~~
That sounds more like Costa at the World Cup than the Falcao we see today. He's been brilliant at keeping the ball under pressure and bringing others into play. In fact, more than his ability in the box, it's been that aspect of his play which has been most impressive... Cos I too, had heard that he was nothing more than a box player, and it was also for this reason that I was, and still am, concerned with the sale of Welbeck because of what he could offer tactically which was unique when compared to the rest of the strikeforce we have.

2192~~~
Yes he has done very well in the respect I agree.

2193~~~
Will he be playing this week for Columbia? Do they have a game this week?

2194~~~
maybe relative to RVP.....he looked much nippier than Robin at the weekend

2195~~~

2196~~~
Focks sake. The last thing we need is another glass player.

Hope they don't risk him. He should have stayed in England.

2197~~~
Hope he stays on the bench. It's a freaking friendly.

2198~~~
Kick off at 1AM btw if anyone wants to watch it.

2199~~~
We're so lucky to have a player like him and Di Maria.

2200~~~
What has he shown since 2012/2013 for us to be lucky with him? Doubt he is any/much better than Rooney atm.

2201~~~
You seem to forget the fact that he was devastatingly good in 2013. Which is LAST YEAR. 11goals in 20 For Monaco after moving from Atleti scoring 28 league goals 34 matches (last year). Then, he's been out of action for 7 months since the beginning of 2014. Hailed as the best number 9 in the game till January THIS year. Some people have really, really short memories.

2202~~~
If he is as good as Rooney we are lucky.

2203~~~
Since 2012/13 in that part I included the Atletico performances he hadn 11 goals in 20 isnt really special for a player of his calibre, and like 3 of then were pens. He is a good player but I doubt he will make us much better than we were without him, ofcourse we have more depth now (in terms of quality) but if we'd put Rooney up front we wouldnt have a problem/it wouldnt be less. Huge difference compared to di Maria.

2204~~~
This comment is baffling.

It's Radamel fecking Falcao.

2205~~~
Just scored for Colombia against El Salvador

2206~~~

2207~~~
He is a far better footballer than rooney. 

I hope that helps.

2208~~~
So our front line is 3 international captains
predict the headline "the three captains" in the near future

Nice goal btw

2209~~~
All scored this international week as well <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2210~~~
Played a part in all 3 goals, should have had 2, Bacca the cheeky cnut nabbed it, anyway a goal and assist from Falcao.

2211~~~
This is the caf. A player can go from Messi to Bebe and back to Messi in the space of 3 games.

2212~~~
Exactly this. Short memories. Was it not also RVP who won us the 20 title under Fergie? We have 2 world class Strikers and Rooney is just below them in class. Rooney is the better player to play just behind them and he has upped his game as a #10, thank feck for no more cross field balls out wide, he seems to be using his vision more and looking for forward passes on the deck.

2213~~~
2 goals in 2 games now... Looks like he found his scoring touch

2214~~~
Did he play the full 90?

2215~~~
I hope so. He did look a bit anxious, for both club and country

2216~~~
Wasn't it rumoured that he had a muscle strain or something? If he did, he really shouldn't be playing the full 90 tbh.

2217~~~
Came off after 60 mins

2218~~~
Is there anymore scheduled match for Colombia?

2219~~~
A beast of a player can't wait till he gets up to 100% fitness. Better than Costa also!

2220~~~
They play Canada on Tuesday (Wednesday early morning if you are in England)

2221~~~
Really really doubt this, can you tell me in which area's he is better? He is a better header of the ball, and is much more sharp/aware in the penalty area. Other than that, I dont know what he can that Rooney couldnt.

2222~~~
Yeah but what has Rooney done since his goal on Thursday

2223~~~
Legendary player

2224~~~
I absolutely feckin love the guy! I cannot wait for him to be back to his best. He has a great attitude and presence, a proper team player as well, he's not a typical selfish striker even his assists are great too!

2225~~~
That's a cracking header. If Di Maria can stop flying corners over everybody maybe we can start being a goal threat from them again with headers like that.

2226~~~
Great header. Was this James with the final ball?

2227~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPw6peo6eM4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2228~~~
Almost had a trick there - he's almost back to top speed!

2229~~~
Quality, quality classy player. Still can't believe he's here......

2230~~~
Cracking header. The way he sniffs chances in the box is brilliant

2231~~~
Great header, he's starting to find his feet again. These matches are, for fecking once, a blessing for us.. that he can get some match fitness without doing it for us.

2232~~~
Captain to boot! I wonder if he has the equivalent of a Colombian scouser-accent too?

2233~~~
Earning just under 100 K.

2234~~~
Definitely reminiscent of Denis Law - the heading, the overhead kicks and obviously the predatory instincts.

2235~~~
Better first touch as well.. I got time for Rooney as a footballer but Falcao is clearly the better #9

2236~~~
I hope you mean Bebe being the top player and Messi being the crap player<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2237~~~
Consistency. You expect a certain level from Falcao and up to his injury he produced that consistently. Rooney has a run of good games, goes into a bad run of games and then starts being good again.

Then there's  heading, finishing, can use his left foot as well as his right foot with the same ability, strength on the ball and many other things. His acceleration up to last year was also better than Rooney's.

2238~~~
Yep. But you could assume not too many people have really followed him since he doesn't play in EPL or UCL. 

He's a fecking beast of a CF on form.

2239~~~
Let's hope he goes on a long goalscoring run now. I'd be quaking in my boots if I was a WBA defender next Monday. Mind you, I'd be filling my boots if I was a WBA attacker.

2240~~~
Directly involved in all three goals. Looks like he's hitting form at the right time.
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2241~~~
He has the best header I have ever seen on football (well Batistuta might have been there too). Wouldn't be surprised at all if he has scored 50-60 goals from headers during his career.

2242~~~
His finishing is by far one of the deadliest in the modern game. Seeing as you have short term memory loss, I am assuming you are basing your judgement on the few games Falcao has played for us.

These are the factors you're failing to consider.

- new, physical league and faster pace of play. Adaptation takes time for any player (great or otherwise)
- First time in a long time, he plays as a partner striker at United. Has almost always played on his own. Has to play differently.
- He has admitted that he's still not 100% after the injury but has said he needs  game time to get it back.
- Hailed by one and all as the deadliest number 9 in the past 3 or 4 years. Everyone from Ronaldo to ex-players. 

As for how he is better than Rooney? He's a pure number 9. He has better movement. Better finishing and better hold-up play.

So, either you can come out of ignorance and embrace knowledge that the world is not flat or you can remain stubborn and be proven wrong later.

Oh and take a look at that header he managed to put in yesterday. Devastating.

2243~~~
I think we can excuse the guy considering he's coming back from a horrible ligament injury which has ended many a playing career in modern football. He'll still be lacking a bit of confidence in taking challenges and running hard on that leg. Think how horrible it is knowing that by some 1000 in a one chance your knee ligaments could snap. It's a mental block and will take time to overcome. What he needs now is goals and our support.

2244~~~
If these are the only things you can name, I dont know how you could say Falcao is better, Rooney has a better shot, better passing, better in the build up, he creates more, is faster, is stronger, better vision, comfortable in more roles.

2245~~~
Impressive goal

2246~~~
No, I look at his performances since his arrival at Monaco, unfortunately, he has also been injured uring that time. U named 3 qualities of Falcao, are there other area's where Falcao is above Rooney? If not, still dont know how you can say he is better than Rooney.

2247~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Z2m7fpzzP4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

You're right.

2248~~~
Sigh... I am saying he's the best NUMBER 9 in world football. Rooney is a cracking player and striker, but he's not a pure number 9. He's sort of an all-round forward. If we were to look at them as strikers, there's no question that Falcao is the better striker. His goalscoring record over the last 5 years says as much.

2249~~~
Do you think Falcao is the best number 9 at the moment? Or recently? He was in 2012/2013 but ever since, Suarez (arguably a 9), ibra, costa, lewandowski, aguero have been better imo.

2250~~~
Inspiring performance! He is such a presence everytime!

2251~~~
Huh? Have you ever watched Falcao, even at Monaco? Half of the things you said are complete nonsense. Rooney has a better shot, passing, build up, faster, stronger... what? Not to mention the rest are debatable.

2252~~~
That's a fair shout, but it is skewed considering that he was out for 7 months amidst all that. You say that he was not too good at Monaco. Well, I can see how motivation could have been a problem for him in France. He was sold to the highest bidder from Atleti because they needed the money to rebuild a squad. They have done splendidly with that money since. Also, as you said he was carrying a few injuries during his six months at Monaco. Every striker that you mentioned in the list has suffered from some lack of form as a result in the past. To think that it was the first time in many years that he had a mini slump is a remarkable.

In Europe, before he came to United, his record stood as - <b>155 goals, 200 games. </b>That is astounding!

Just because he's had a less spectacular six months (mostly to injury), prior to his 7 month lay off, doesn't mean he's any less of a player! Give him a year or two and then judge. If he's been average, I'll acquiesce to your point of view.

2253~~~
Add the headers that he scored for Monaco and Columbia (which are missing in this video) and he has likely scored more than 60 headers in his career. It is really an amazing stat and I doubt that there is an another player who matches it.

2254~~~
That header was a beauty!...Was more impressed with his work for the third goal, mind. That touch and finish was exquisite, shame the guy on the line nicked the goal.

2255~~~
I'd swear some of our own fans want Falcao to fail here as some sort of vindication due to residual anger over Danny being sold.

2256~~~
I don't think that the case at all.

2257~~~
Or hes just been underwhelming so far

2258~~~
But he hasn't, 2 assists and a goal as well as some good link-up play. For a guy who was out with a very serious injury and is just getting back and getting used to a new league that is much more physical and fast than anything he's been used to, he's doing fine. The way some are going on you'd think he was 6 months into his United career, not 6 games.

2259~~~
He has not been. Look at the context!

2260~~~
Underwhelming only if you compare it to what you'd maybe expect from one of the best in the world.

Not underwhelming if you examine everything going on

2261~~~
Rooney his build up, is one of the best in the world for a striker, and that he is faster, stronger are just facts, rooney is one of the fastest player around, and stats declare that. Dont know how you doubt that Rooney has better passing, shot.

2262~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2263~~~
No way has he been underwhelming.

2264~~~
Can't stop watching the goal

2265~~~
Come on. He's hardly set the world on fire so far.

2266~~~
Pyromania is a crime.

And i think that a player who plays well in an effective attack, can't be underwhelming.

2267~~~
For me, personally, he has been a little underwhelming. Not gonna lie.
But that's not to say he's been poor, and there are valid reasons to consider.

I guess it comes down to how well you expected him to start.

2268~~~
2 assists and 1 goal in less 200 minutes is underwhelming for you? Do you expect Messi type of goalscoring or Ronaldo's?

2269~~~
The bandwagon that follows everytime someone posts something even slightly negative about Falcao on here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Christ its becoming cringe worthy. Oppo fans must be pissing themselves laughing.

2270~~~
Yeah, because that was his record prior to the ACL

2271~~~
He's billed as the best striker in the world, so far at least 3 premier league strikers have been performing better than he has.

I expect more than a cross and lots of fluffed shots, yeah

2272~~~
I wouldn't say he's been underwhelming in my eyes; I see it more as a gradual buildup of his performances improving. He's been involved in all of the games he has played bar his 20 minute cameo at the start, which is pleasing considering he has the same amount of assists in 4 games as he has played in 2 league seasons. Removes one of the theories that he is a "poacher", which he couldn't be further from as his main asset.

2273~~~
Imagine that,people having different opinions on forum. Fantastic.yeah and no fans from other clubs have different opinions about one player,united fans are special about and oppo fans are laughing about it...

2274~~~
Falcao has shown a lot of good stuff for me. He isn't hit an type of form which is the great thing. When he does he will be an animal. His strength and movement will be too much.

2275~~~
Its been 3 games,not 50.

2276~~~
I'm sure they are. It's utterly stupid.

2277~~~
Its the fact that if anyone says anything even hinting at negativity, there's a flock of people straight in here telling us why Falcao has actually been brilliant, or talking about things like 'well he has great movement' or 'shown some good touches'. Its hilarious. 

You can tell the people who are judging his performances thus far for United, and those that have a preconceived opinion of him and will refuse to accept anything other then that.

2278~~~
Personally, I just find it a tad ridiculous someone saying Falcao has been underwhelming considering he has played less than 200 minutes and he has been quite productive also. The only way you would consider Falcao underwhelming is if you expected him to be our Messi or Ronaldo which will never happen. It's just a matter of expectations.

2279~~~
I understand but some people exaggerate in the opposite sense saying he has been underwhelming and that they expected that and that. 
What do they expect, him scorint 2 or 3 goals every game? 

Although he hasnt been brilliant he hasnt been that bad either. On top of that he has come in a new league and in a new team with lots of problems and a team which is trying to find its game and hasnt clicked (although it's on the good way imo), so all being said it hasnt been all that bad. I'm sure when he finds his form he'll be on fire. He had a very good game for Colombia now and hopefully he has found his shooting form.

2280~~~
Just a question, what do you expect from him? If he isnt a 25 league goals striker, I wouldnt want us to get him for so much money.

2281~~~
I think everyone is expecting that kind of return from him. However, it is important to remember that he is being nursed back to fitness after his injury lay off combined with the fact that he's now playing in a new team in a new league.

2282~~~
Yeah but if he doesnt show it, or if he doesnt get back to his best form, it wouldnt be a good risk to pay 50-60 million euro's.

2283~~~
I do not expect 25 goals from our strikers, because we play with three of them, the goals will come from all of them. Unless we score +100 goals this season.

2284~~~
We play 2 of them, but if you expect less of him, lets say 15 goals, would you pay the fee AS Monaco requires?

2285~~~
I'm certain that he'll be back to his best after Christmas. A good six months of performances would reassure me at least.

If he's playing well and getting goals - and have struck up a partnership with whoever upfront, then yeah.

2286~~~
Dont really agree with this then, would only pay that kind of money if the player has a world class impact on us, just like di Maria has for example. Playing well and getting goals is a bit too little to pay 50-60 millions imo.

2287~~~
I expect from him at least 20 to 25 goals yeah cause he was capable of that before. And of course if we wont be satisfied with him we wont buy him.
But maybe he'll be good with lets say 15 goals but overall displays will be good and he'll have lot of assists.

2288~~~
That's a fair opinion. I wouldn't worry though, he'll come good for us.

2289~~~
It depends on the team: 

- If we play with one striker, then no because Rooney is cheaper.
- If we play with 3 strikers like right now, no because we will need to buy an other striker to replace RVP and we could use 50m in a better way, unless Wilson and/or Henriquez can make it. (obviously it would be a luxury)
- If we play with 2 strikers, then yes if he scores 20 goals and 10 assists.

2290~~~
We should just rename Sammyjunn as ABUJunn and be done with it.

2291~~~
This translates to "everyone that thinks he's been underwhelming is right, and everyone disagreeing is wrong." If he had come directly to us from his last season at Atletico I think most would agree he's not lived up to his billing, as his form was so great at that point, but most here are simply being realistic about the injury he has come back from and the fact he is adapting to a new team and league as well as the fact we aren't playing him in his best role.

To me if you judge in context of the last 7 months he's had then his performances have been fine so far. Obviously if he's not doing more come January then I think we'll all start to get concerned, but not after 6 games where he's managed a goal and 2 assists playing in a role he isn't used to.

2292~~~
This. Some of the reactions on here to his 3 starts have been laughable/pathetic. What were people expecting from someone who missed a large chuck of last season through a serious injury, is only getting back to match fitness, and is settling into a new club and league? Some people will never be happy.

2293~~~
Really hate the fact that if someone has a different opinion, he is considered as ABU, what have I said to earn that title? Genuine question.

2294~~~
Football fans are fickle. My only explanation. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2295~~~
The floodgates will open soon for Falcao. Patience people!

2296~~~
Nothing wrong with his posts tbh.

2297~~~
Point?

2298~~~
Point - You're impatient.

2299~~~
So I'm not allowed to think he's been "underwhelming so far" in 3 starts?

Of course I am, I am allowed to have an opinion after 1 game. I have this opinion after 3.

2300~~~
Quote me where I wrote 'you're not allowed to think he's been underwhelming so far'.

2301~~~
It's too soon to form a proper opinion on him. You may be able to form an opinion on a player after 3 games (or even 1 as you suggest) but it won't be an accurate one. Like others I haven't been overly impressed by Falcao so far, however I am placing little or no weight on his performances so far due to the circumstances. If he is still playing like this come Christmas then people can judge him. It's ridiculous to be saying your underwhelmed by a player after a handful of games though.

2302~~~
My opinion is that Falcao has been underwhelming so far. The "so far" part shows that its a small amount of time and subject to change, which I'm hopeful of happening.

Else I'd just call him underwhelming, right? Because without the so far, it means I have a fully formed opinion of him that will be hard to change.

I don't know why its so complicated for some people.

2303~~~
It's just kind of a dumb thing to say after 3 games, especially when he's had a goal and 2 assists.

2304~~~
So many people struggling to grasp the meaning of 'so far'.

2305~~~
It's like watching first bit in Star Wars where the text scrolls down the screen and announcing that the film has been underwhelming so far. 

It's not incorrect, just kind of stupid to say.

2306~~~
So I guess it stupid to say that Di Maria or Herrera have been impressive or how about Costa or Fabregas, seeing as its only been 4 games, right?

You can't have it both ways.

2307~~~
My point is it's a bit harsh calling him underwhelming so far considering his circumstances (serious injury, new club, new league, etc.). Judge his performances in a few months. Not after 3 games.

2308~~~
Well I could watch the start of a James Bond film and say "this is great" but it'd still be stupid to announce that the Godfather is underwhelming after 10 minutes. 

So yes, I can have it both ways <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2309~~~
You can only have it both ways to suit your agenda.

Writing Falcao off after 4 games, and declaring him shit? Thats stupid. 
Saying that his first few performances have been underwhelming? Thats an assessment.

2310~~~
That depends on your expectations and I'd assert that anyone <i>expecting</i> him to do better than he has done so far has had expectations that are too high.

2311~~~
It's not a fair/accurate one when you fail to take into account the fact that the player has just recovered from a serious knee injury, still isn't fully match fit, and is settling into a new club and league. If people are underwhelmed with the performances of the likes of Rooney, RVP or Mata then that's fair enough. However, given Falcao's circumstances he should be allowed some slack.

2312~~~
I guess I'm just being cautious, not getting ahead of myself, especially given the chastising experience of last season. But the first three of these are all, while being very fair mitigating circumstances, things that could conceivably become longer term problems. He may struggle to adapt to our league. He may struggle to adapt to playing with a partner. His injury could have had a lasting impact on his game. 

Nothing is going to take away what he was but, yes, he has been a little underwhelming for us. He hasn't been the world's deadliest looking striker. He hadn't had the start Costa has for example. I'll be surprised if he can match Costa's goal return this season.

2313~~~
Why is he not match fit though? He had a full pre-season with Monaco, and even started the season with them.

2314~~~
When you are out for as long as he was it takes more than a pre-season to regain your full fitness. When a player finishes a season in May they are only getting back up to speed come August. He got injured in February so he has more catching up to do compared to others. He hasn't lasted much past the hour mark in the 3 matches he has started so far and he had began to visibly tire in each. He regularly played 90 minutes before his injury so it's not something that he has struggled with in the past. He clearly isn't match fit but should reach that point in the next few weeks.

2315~~~
I'll judge 3 games on 3 games.

Our CBs are always coming back from injury, they get a few games and are judged. If they aren't brilliant, our fans want new CBs in

Yes I'm underwhelmed by all of those players so far this season.

But none of the others came into the season with the reputation of being the best striker in the world, nor is this thread about them.

2316~~~
I didn't see Law play but he reminds me of Ruud.

2317~~~
I'm sure you didn't type that with a serious face <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2318~~~
Yes, because if we make champions league, next season we will have 60+ games and that 15 will grow to 25+

2319~~~
The guy is an absolute beast. If he starts hitting his stride alongside Di Maria, we're going to be a force to be reckoned with.

2320~~~
If he's playing, I'd have thought Mata would be our best option for taking corners (and free kicks for that matter.)

2321~~~
I don't understand why Di Maria is taking corners for us. It should be Rooney for left and RVP for right. They are better at it.

2322~~~
His ability to hold the ball up and bring others into play has been really impressive. He has gotten an assist or goal in each of his starts. I judge the strikers' game by game for the most part, goal or no goal. I judge the strikers' overall season or form of 6 or so games by goals. So for example, there comes a point where his overall great play is no longer good enough and goals need to be added for me to consider him as playing great. That point for Falcao hasn't come yet as he has only had 3 starts thus far. In this short period I thought he has looked great.

If he fails to add more goals in the next couple of games despite his overall performance, then I will say he has been underwhelming.

2323~~~
It's more effective the other way around a right footer on the right and a left footer on the left.

2324~~~
Falcao has been fine but I understand people who are underwhelmed. Anybody who watched him 2 years ago knows how good he was/can be. He just looks a little rushed in front of goal to me.

2325~~~
I suppose it doesn't help Falcao that Di Maria has wasted no time in showing his talent and heavily influencing games (as if every player at a new club immediately shows their worth).

That said, it's three games, and not even three games where you'd say he's been poor.  It's just absurd that it can even be considered a realistic point of contention.

2326~~~
To be fair he could've had another 3-4 for us in his handful of appearances, he's forever in the right place for the crosses its scary. As I recall he's been inches away from about 2-3 headers already that would have resulted in certain goals.

2327~~~
I think it's a bit silly for people to be underwhelmed. He's recovering from a serious knee injury which we all knew about, meaning he hasn't played properly for months. He is joining a new team in a new role where he is partnering another striker for the first time rather than being the sole focal point and he's done just fine so far. Two assists and a goal in 4 appearances (231 minutes) isn't bad at all. He's also shown some good link-up play, his ability to hold the ball up is fantastic and he doesn't let defenders bully him at all, and his movement in the box has been really good too. Give him chance, he was always bound to be a little tentative/rusty to begin with. The good signs for me is that it is clear that he is getting into good goalscoring positions and more and more the chances are falling to him and it wont be long before his sharpness is fully back. He will be brilliant for us, and so far the signs are all positive. He coming into form at the right time. That passion when he scored was brilliant. I remember reading a Sid Lowe article (I think) a while back - when he was heavily linked with Chelsea (probably after that Super Cup game) where he said his game is all about what he does inside the box and that people shouldn't expect anything outside of it. I think he's been excellent for us so far in terms of build up, he's so much more involved than he usually is and the fact that he has two assists already is a bonus considering he got 0 in 17 Ligue 1 apps last season and 1 in 34 La Liga apps the season before.

I wouldn't mild us adopting a sort of christmas tree formation with Mata and Rooney behind Falcao because I think if we give him that freedom to be the deadly predator in the box, it will bring the best out in him, but I don't think LvG will be dropping RvP any time soon.

2328~~~
It is a bit impatient to be fair, Ekeke.

Falcao, despite being underwhelming in your eyes, has got a winning goal and a couple of assists. Not bad at all for someone settling in a new team following a serious injury.

2329~~~
I think if he stays fit he'll be back to his very best, who knows, maybe even better?  There's a number of factors stopping him from reaching a confident form,  playing for a massive club, basically being on a trial (the loan) and trying to prove people wrong after a career changing injury. Even if he is 100% and his knee is stronger than ever  it must constantly be on his mind because every reporter that talks to him brings it fecking up...

LVG seems to have the right idea, keep playing him even when he's not scoring, even if that  might be frustrating and even though its early days  I honestly think we're gonna hit a win on this one.

Not a bad start at all.

2330~~~
I'm shocked anyone would say they are underwhelmed with a goal, two assists and a clear building of match fitness in three games.

Pathetic to call that underwhelming, especially given the context - new club, culture and recovery from serious injury.

2331~~~
This talk of Falcao underwhelming is a joke, even if his detractors are saying they only mean "so far".

Take a look at Welbeck and Hernandez uselessly plodding for us last season, that was underwhelming.

2332~~~
According to the caf (his thread at least), Welbeck is the second coming of Messi based on some of the carryon that was going on in there.

2333~~~
The revisionism on Welbeck is cringeworthy. He never justified anything other than a bit part role at United. At Arsenal, he's grabbed a few goals but largely underwhelmed in the big games. No loss.

2334~~~
Three games played and people are saying he's an underwhelming signing...there's no pleasing football fans.

2335~~~
I always liked Danny and thought he would come good for us but even I was a bit surprised at the outrage that went through his thread when we sold him. Especially considering that he always seemed like one of the cafs favorite whipping boys mainly for his sub-par finishing. So I was really surprised that there was such a massive outcry over him leaving.

2336~~~
Its typical football fan kneejerking and fickleness on display. We actually replaced him with Wilson imo, not falcao.

2337~~~
Falcao looks like he has a lot of gears in him though to be fair, like you can tell there is a beast waiting to be unleashed if his fitness is right.. he still looks quick to me, but it is the match sharpness, dribbling, turning etc which is still sluggish. He needs a long period of staying fit before we can truly judge his worth.

2338~~~
You really wonder sometimes. Football fans can be spoilt idiots

2339~~~
Yeah especially with someone like Di Maria also coming new into the team and pretty much running the show here from his first game. But Falcao was always going to take longer until he gets going he missed the WC due to an injury and only came here in the last hours of the transfer window.

2340~~~
Yes it was and thats why they aren't here anymore.

But they've been brigther for their new clubs than Falcao has been for his.

So far.

If that doesn't change, we shouldn't buy him. It has to right?

2341~~~
And you have every right to be underwhelmed by them as they have underperformed. 

They also didn't come into this season after having suffered a serious injury. They also came into the season playing for the same club as they did last season and in the league in which they have played for the majority of their careers. Basically you cannot judge the performances of Falcao as strictly as those of the likes of Mata, Rooney and RVP. Their circumstances are completely different and it's unfair to expect Falcao to perform at the same level as them given his circumstances. 

I'll use a hypothetical situation to explain this. If a player has been out for a number of months and has been named on the bench for the first since recovering from this serious injury what would you expect from them when they come on the pitch? If they came on for 20 minutes and looked sluggish, had a poor first touch or lacked composure in front of goal, would you say you were underwhelmed? The correct answer is no. The player is obviously going to be rusty and will take a few weeks to get back into top gear. It would be unreasonable to expect any more from them. Conversely, if a player who has been fit all season, comes of the bench for 20 minutes and plays just as poorly as the first player, then they ought to be open to criticism. There are no mitigating circumstances that can excuse their poor performance. They shouldn't be rusty or lacking match fitness. 

This is my point with Falcao. Obviously his situation is quiet similar to that of the first player. He clearly is finding his way back to form after a serious knee injury. Anyone is "underwhelmed" with his performances so far need a reality check. He is only human. If anyone expected him to be banging them in already then they were wrong to expect that from a player that isn't fully fit. Remember Ronaldo at the World Cup? Even he couldn't perform to his usual levels. People a can be underwhelmed by Falcao's performances if he is playing at this level come Christmas (not that he has been poor so far). However, they are wrong to be expecting so much of him at this stage given his circumstances. Give the guy a chance.

2342~~~
Indeed.

2343~~~
Fixed

2344~~~
Nail on head. He has just been trying a little too hard to get off the mark. Now that he has I'm sure he'll relax a bit more and the goals will flow.

2345~~~
He's fluffed chances so far. The goal vs Everton will do him a world of good. I don't think he's physically at the level he was pre-injury but still, with the likes of Rooney, Mata, Di Maria and Herrera providing the ammunition he'll score shedloads. Just wait and see.

2346~~~
One thing that's been bothering me slightly over the past few months. Is he rightly labeled a mercenary? Is he one really?

2347~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1e8ncw/explaining_the_falcao_move_to_monaco" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1e8ncw/explaining_the_falcao_move_to_monaco</a>

2348~~~
I've not got involved in this Falcao vs Welbeck debate as I recognize the qualities of both players and rate them both highly.

However, if there has been any revisionism regarding Welbeck, it is by his now detractors. Nobody was so down on Welbeck previously.

Yeah his goal scoring was always debated, but everyone accepted that he was very good at everything else. Now you'd think he was shite based on what you read on here.

2349~~~
Can't wait for him to put up the same figures he was putting up for Porto ad Atleti!

2350~~~
Cheers. That would explain why he so badly wants to succeed at United.

2351~~~
So what's the deal with his third party ownership thing nowadays? How are we allowed to sign him up when the league forbids third party arrangements?

2352~~~
He's not under 3rd party anymore.

2353~~~
He actually takes very good corners. But he seems to be struggling here. Maybe it takes time to get used to the slope.

2354~~~
His link-up play has been amazing and he has 2 assists and a goal. 

Underwhelming? Simply ridiculous.

2355~~~
Jesus <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2356~~~
You think it hasn't been? Seems we're watching different games. Holds up the ball incredibly well and is picking the right passes between Mata/RVP/Rooney.

2357~~~
I think its been good. His first couple of apperences he looked a bit sloppy, but the two games since he's shown good touches and hold up.

I don't think its been anywhere near amazing though.

2358~~~
Amazing is probably hyperbole, but I think he's been better than Rooney and RVP at hold up play.

2359~~~
Yeah I'd agree with that.

2360~~~
We badly need this guy in beast mode if we are to get anything in games vs Chelsea and City.

2361~~~
I think Monaco bought his 100%

2362~~~
And I love his ability to keep the ball after being hounded by three opposition players. Fully fit Falcao and Rooney will be tasty.

2363~~~
I think he's one(I am using it as a descriptive term and not as a pejorative). 

I find it strange though. He comes across as an humble and modest guy who is pleased to be here and will give it his best.

2364~~~
True, it's really a strange one. He's so humble and hard working, but on the other hand, a few of his big money moves do raise the question.

2365~~~
He's owned by a third party who basically dictate where he plays. Their main interest is making money so Monaco were an obvious choice. I think there was an article linked a couple of pages back which explained his situation.

Edit - Here it is <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1e8ncw/explaining_the_falcao_move_to_monaco" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1e8ncw/explaining_the_falcao_move_to_monaco</a>

2366~~~
Honestly, Falcao could have lowered his wage demand and could have transferred to any club won major trophies and built a legacy. Instead, he chose to go to Monaco and earn as much as he could. 

I'm glad he's here now and I'm going to cherish his goals and hold-up play.

2367~~~
Outswinging as opposed to in-swinging? Disagree entirely.

2368~~~
Radamel Falcao has impressed whilst on international duty with Colombia and has again been the man the media want to speak to. The Manchester United striker, on loan from Ligue 1's AS Monaco, has spoken of his pride after scoring the opening goal against El Salvador for Colombia. He feels it was important to get that goal and, as ever, is thrilled to represent his country in such a way.

Falcao's love of playing for Colombia is being matched by his love of Manchester United and all things related to it. The Colombian striker has hugely taken to the Premier League club and will tell that to anyone who will listen. He and his wife have made it known they're incredibly happy with the summer transfer and want to remain at Manchester United and in Manchester for many years to come.

One of the things which has made the family feel so welcome is the reaction of Manchester United fans toward their new superstar striker. Falcao's transfer was something of a shock, with Angel di maria being a deal which in comparison dragged on for some time. Manchester United fans weren't used to signing the likes of Angel di Maria so to do that and then secure Falcao in a deadline day swoop was a huge boost to the club after a difficult season under David Moyes. All that has helped the reaction to the Colombian and he's noticed.

Falcao has told media in his own country that when the Old Trafford supporters sing his name, a name they currently sing more than any other, that it sounds like thunder, such is the noise that is created within the stadium <b>"It's magic, I would have never imagined in an institution such as Manchester United, the love they are showing me; my name sounds like thunder at the stadium, it is something that fills me with pride."</b>

The striker has a knack of finding the back of the net and an equal knack of saying just the right thing.

2369~~~
Yeah, well never really understand the true reason, but with these 3rd party type deals, I don't think Falcao chose, as much as he was "advised" to go to Monaco.

But yeah, I hope he's found his home now <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2370~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> very loveable bloke

2371~~~
It's a Wenger theory, and i just looked up, he is wrong and you are right.

2372~~~
nice. another goal and could easily had one or two more. he's getting there.

2373~~~
Well going from being watched by 7k fans to 70k fans belting out your name can be overwhelming I suppose <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2374~~~
There's just something about Falcao, he's just such a lovable guy.

2375~~~
"My name sounds like thunder at the stadium."

That's a cool line.

2376~~~
Wow, the past few pages really speak volumes of our fans. I bet if he scores the winner against Chelsea or City, everyone will be asking Woodward to sign him up?

2377~~~
Totally. Love that line.

He's an instant hit for me. Looks like he loves being here, and seems an all-round loveable bloke! Singing that song is a highlight at every game. Lo lo lo lo lo lo... <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2378~~~

2379~~~
Look at the power he gets on that. Astonishing. And yes, this should have stood.

2380~~~
That's a great finish. A shame that it was wrongly disallowed.

2381~~~
the guy's pure class

2382~~~
Always moving inside the box. It's great to watch.

2383~~~
It's a bit like a finish you'd expect from Hernandez with difference of like 5-6 yards, crazy power to finish like that from 11.

2384~~~
I guess finishes like those are why he was called the best number 9 a season or so ago. After a bit of anxiousness to start with, I get the feeling its all coming back to him <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> One stride to get away from his marker and a powerful snap shot into the bottom corner.

2385~~~
Is that a right footed backheel shot, that is ridiculous accuracy and power?

2386~~~
I think he side foots it, but the way he falls sort of masks it. Either way it's an amazing finish with such short time to react.

I love the way he is basically not moving, then all of a sudden springs into life and makes 2 yards just in time to get the shot away, perfect.

2387~~~
His movement in and around the box is so sharp. He's Hernandez with quality build up play and touch included.

2388~~~
Falcao receiving the ball in the penalty box is much different to a Falcao receiving the ball outside.

2389~~~
GFY version:


That touch is insane.

2390~~~
How the feck did he do that? There's not that much pace on the ball, there's no follow through or backswing, yet he's got huge power on it.

2391~~~
Tevez type of finish.

2392~~~
Fantastic finish, I can't understand why it was disallowed, was the player nearest the touchline adjudged to be offside?

2393~~~
Yea the 1-2 in the build up was adjudged to be offside. In a reply I saw from another angle down the line, I actually thought it was the correct call, but a tight call either way.

2394~~~
My biggest concern is that he does seem to be at his best as the lone striker. I know it's early days but I believe he is too similar to RVP and often they will be competing for the same spaces inside the box, and will RVP off colour at the moment, I'm not sure how much it's going to impact Falcao's game at United.

2395~~~
Bench RVP, it doesnt get much easier.

2396~~~
Thats an absolute beauty of a finish. A few more of those and my doubts will certainly be silenced.

A real shame it was disallowed.

2397~~~
The man will fire us into the top 4(its used to be title,how mighty have stumbled!). It was only when he signed did I bealive in the top 4 being a real possibility. Damn,we have Radamel Falcao!

2398~~~
I really like saying his name. Every time I play my mate on FIFA I wind him up by just saying 'Radamel Falcao' over and over again in the manner of Peter Griffin's Starlight Express moment.

2399~~~
We're not so far from Chelsea, dare to dream my friend.

2400~~~
Its coming back to him.

2401~~~
He makes Eurosports top 10 worst signings page <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>. Total bullshit given half the players they have on there weren't even brought in for the reasons they are slamming them for. There have been plenty of signings much worse than him.

<a class="externalLink" href="https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/early-doors/the-premier-league-s-dirty-dozen--12-worst-signings-of-the-season-163713502.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blog...2-worst-signings-of-the-season-163713502.html</a>

2402~~~
That was my first thought when I watched that 'goal' too.

2403~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Half that list is laughable and the rest are barely arguable.

2404~~~
<i>Yes, he's shown off all sorts of tricks. Yes, you don't expect him to score the lion's share of goals when he's playing on the left side of a strong attacking formation.</i>

Could either of those sentences be more wrong? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

What an amazing 'article'.

2405~~~
Those flop signings after a few motnhs has to be the worst kind of journalism. After 2 months they write about worst signings already. Pathetic.

I remember the poll 2 years ago from Marca that Modric was the greatest flop of the summer, just after a few months where he struggled to get into the team. Now undroppable and a bargain. You cant just write a player off after a few months, especially this type of players.

2406~~~
I love the 15m £ part, he wasn't earning that with Monaco and there is no reason to assume that United is paying Falcao's taxes.

Edit: And where is Felipe Luis ?

2407~~~
Madness. Scored the winning goal for us vs Everton and came close to scoring in almost every other game he's played in. Also has a few assists.

2408~~~
Do those guys actually get paid to write that shit?

2409~~~
Joke of an article. There's been some real crap on Eurosport recently, they ran an opinion piece saying all derby games should go to penalties if still 0-0 after extra time, after the Liverpool - Everton was deemed to be a letdown. Says a lot about the site that I couldn't figure out if the guy writing it was on a massive wind up or was actually serious.

2410~~~
That article is just daft.

Alexis Sanchez is a world class player at the age of 25. He will be great for Arsenal if they keep him around and he offers them more penetration in attack than their typical playmakers do along with now Welbeck, Walcott and Chamberlain. He was a good buy, just not the buy that everyone was expecting Arsenal to make.

Luke Shaw was expensive, but with home-grown rules, his talent and professionalism taken into account it's a good buy on paper.
He already has loads of premier league experience as well.

Didier Drogba certainly is a better 2nd/3rd alternative than Torres. They upgraded their choices on the front this year, and Drogba is a beloved character both amongst the fans and their squad, and has only respect for Mourinho, so I don't expect him to bemoan his position in the squad. Money really isn't a big issue for Chelsea either with no loans and loads of valuable talents around, and their first team already settled with the exception of replacing their main central defenders.
Besides, they let Eto'o go. I'm fairly certain that Drogba ain't earning shitloads more than him.

Eliaquim Mangala is a very talented and physical central defender.
What have experts and sofa-managers said about Manchester City for some time? They needed another quality central defender. Mangala was expensive but he is very young, gives them another good option at the back and could potentially end up as one of the very best defenders in the game. Bad buy how exactly? 

Rio Ferdinand to QPR is a given on the field.
But if they end up not having him as a first choice, he will give them experience during trainings and a good leading character. 
All in all a most-likely bad acquirement, but he was initially a free-transfer and with a sensible wage-package he is worth the punt.

Mario Balotelli is a walking (not running) catastrophy, but for the 18 million Liverpool reportedly paid for him, at that time during the transfer-window i don't think they were completely looking in the mist. He is undoubtfully talented but mentally screwed, he still might turn it around at Anfield. But certainly one of the worst buys so far. Again, still young and could grow to be a Liverpool talisman.

I really don't know much about Emmanuel Riviere, so i won't comment on how he plays. 
But for 5.5-million it's surely worth a punt on a relatively highly rated player from a league Newcastle have had decent luck with from before, who is still just 24.

Carlos Sanchez could just need some time to bed in at Villa, still at 1-5 million pounds it's really not much money to pay for someone who did well at the world cup. It's a punt, it may turn out bad and it may turn out good. Way too early to tell considering he came from Spain who plays football very different from the English style.

Ben Davies himself might do well, but the fact that Spurs paid money as well as giving Swansea Sigurdssson you can give it a claim as the worst transfer - if not for the potential of him being a decent player for Tottenham which he can grow up to be at the age of just 21. Tottenham needed another left-back and they already had Eriksen, Lamela & Holtby who can play in that role. It's not a huge loss for them to let Sigurdsson go, though it's a great gain for Swansea.

I have no idea about Brown Ideye and haven't watched him at all. Price seems steep so i'll give them that one.

The loan of Falcao is just stupidity to include. People have claimed Van Persie might not be up for it, Rooney having his off-form periods, Chicharito being useless at anything but finishing (but he has been useless at that for quite some time as well) and Welbeck being more of a "team-player" than an out and out striker - yet it's insisted that acquiering one of the best strikers in the world (first on loan to check his long-term fitness) is a bad idea? Even if the reported 15 million fee was true, you'd still have to consider that we don't know if it knocks off some of the price of the potential transfer-agreement.

Seems like they were so interested in making an article with a negative tone that they just had to spout some shit.

2411~~~
wtf 7 games into the season. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2412~~~
There's not even a name to that article. It's only "by Eurosport". I don' bother even reading this kind of stuff if there isn't a name to it and it's meant to be taken seriously.

2413~~~
Judging player by 4 games in which he didn't even play all game. Just joke.

Putting Shaw there is even more a joke. Or putting there Sanchez (he wasn't bad), Rio (came for free and is first team player for QPR) and Drogba (was brought in non formal assistant/player role and he is there just for the numbers). And Lukaku must be a flop. After last season of flopping Everton paid their record fee for him? Maybe he wasn't in the best form lately but saying after already one very good season that he is a flop is a step to far.

And yes i am one of those people who will rather give one or two seasons to player before making any judgements. Some hit the ground from the start, others needs time to adapt because it isn't the easiest job coming in the new country and adapt.

And about Falcao. His finish against (i think) Canada showed how good a player he is. To bad it was disallowed. I am confident that he will start banging them in sooner rather than later.

2414~~~
He wouldnt be there, hes just not played, when he has hes been pretty good. Its just Cesar and Ivan are in terrific form.

2415~~~
Ben Davies is there, the 21 year old player who plays in the same position as Filipe Luis.

2416~~~
I have nothing against Felipe Luis and don't think that he is a flop but if they were pertinent Felipe Luis should be with Drogba, Ben Davies or Even Shaw who was injured. It is weird to forgot Felipe Luis when he is a starter who failed to start.

2417~~~
Click bait is best ignored

2418~~~
I agree but you won't believe what I say in my next post...

2419~~~
Starts on the bench tonight with RvP obviously still in the starting line up. Falcao must have taken a knock then, because that decision can't be based on the form of either player.

2420~~~
van Gaal said it's to do with the fact he arrived two days later and from South Africa. It's justified, van Persie's poor form is irrelevant.

2421~~~
Jet lag, which is fair enough.

2422~~~
Ah ok, fair enough...

2423~~~
Really thought he'd be up for it tonight, and it was set up for him to get his season started for us. It's a pity.

2424~~~
Hope he gets at least 30 minutes.

2425~~~
Easy get out for LvG, that one. My guess is he always wanted to try one striker before the Chelsea and City matches, and the internationals gave a reasonable excuse for benching Falcao.

Very disappointing for those of us who thought Falcao would kick on from here, especially with how disappointing Van Persie's been.

2426~~~
I think we all need to accept that RVP is undroppable Unless he's injured he will be one the first names on the team sheet week in week out.

2427~~~
It's more of a choice between Adnan and Falcao than RVP vs. Falcao. Radamel will score tonight anyway.

2428~~~
It's looking like it.

Yeah, it shouldn't be though. I hope you're right with your prediction. At the end of the day the points are all that matters anyways.

2429~~~
Falcao played in New York midweek and he has been performing at most at the same level as RVP...

2430~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2431~~~
LOL we are cursed. Radamel save us.

2432~~~
He was a handful with the few minutes he had and made their defenders work and hassle far more than RvP did.

2433~~~
He has a knack of keeping the ball in tight spaces. He did more in his 20 minutes than RvP did all game.

2434~~~
Yep, he seems strong and capable of good close control in tight spaces... also has a bit of Suarez' luck of balls bouncing on chins and then back to his feet.

2435~~~
yeah, shame there was not much getting into open spaces in the box at the end, seemed like West Brom had 15 players in the box for the last 5-10 minutes

2436~~~
Looked good in his cameo. One of the very few positives of the night.

2437~~~
King of the assists <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2438~~~
Certainly looked hungry when he came. Would have done a better job of attacking Di Maria's crosses than any of our other attackers on show.

2439~~~
Just play him ffs

2440~~~
He really needs to be a regular starter now. Preferably ahead of RVP.

2441~~~
Falcao's goal record looks terrible on paper but most of his appearances were through substitution. Plus he's contributed more to the team this season than Van Persie has I feel.

One reason not to trust statistics.

2442~~~
Play him ahead of RvP. He's more mobile and seems to actually care. Impressive strength on the ball, his low center of gravity definitely helps.

2443~~~
His hold up play is on different level to RVP.

Proper focal point to play off.

2444~~~
All those delicious first half crosses (mainly from Di Maria) - I'm sure Falcao would have gobbled a few up if he was on the pitch.

2445~~~
RVP is exclent on the ball/hold up play. Falcao just looks hungrier than RVP right now. HE fought harder for the ball today than most of our players.

2446~~~
I know its easy to say now but you have to wonder if we could of won this game with Falcao starting, some of those DiMaria crosses were delicious.

2447~~~
Hopefully he starts next weekend. You can tell when he got subbed on that he was just sharper then RvP, always gets in good positions and has great strength and hold up play. Just needs to get back in form and back to full fitness as he's still recovering from his acl injury.

2448~~~
More was than Is. He looks soft and his touch is like Chicharito this season.  Defenders just push him off.

2449~~~
Did well when he came on. Only thing that annoyed me was that he was hovering around the edge of the penalty areas on a couple of the last corners. Considering he is so good in the air it seemed a waste

2450~~~
Has to start on Sunday for me. Whether RVP is alongside him or not.

2451~~~
Shame that Di Maria went off so soon after Falcao came on. The crosses we were putting in in the first half, tailor made for Falcao. Perhaps shouldve been brought on earlier. I don't mean this as a slight on Fellaini, especially after his performance today, but I'd rather Falcao have been bought on at half time. 
Needs to start against Chelsea, even if we are only starting one striker, it needs to be him.

2452~~~
It really made me angry watching Di Maria put in some beautiful crosses which RvP just didn't bother attacking and then knowing that Falcao is sitting on the bench. Angers you even more when you see the header he scored last weekend for Columbia. We've "nursed" him back enough, he needs to replace RvP now.

2453~~~
It was extremely frustrating. Van Persie rarely gets on the end of those so we should've changed tactic or played Falcao from the start.

2454~~~
Will be interesting to see if he gets to start the next match against chelski. Whether LVG will try and partner him and RVP up top or actually have the balls to drop RVP!

He really seems motivated and hungry everytime he comes on the pitch. Based on his track record he is a big game type of player too. We definitely need a positive result in the next two fixtures or we might end up falling too far behind.

Falcao looked very physical today and seemed to make things happen when he came on. Positive signs.

2455~~~
Should start against Chelsea.

2456~~~
This, completely.

2457~~~
Falcao looks so good. I think him and Di Maria will be our stars this season. Couldn't be more impressed with what i have seen. Can not believe he is behiind rvp in the pecking order. Or januzaj. He should have started tonight unless there were concerns after the internationals.

2458~~~
Seems to have very good hold up play as well, can hold the ball, turn, and run with it, something RVP and rooney cant seem to do these days

2459~~~
He has 'late winner against chelsea' written all over him.

2460~~~
His strength and skill are fantastic. Once he gets chances he will be formidable for us.

2461~~~
Hopefully LvG gets over his mancrush on RvP and starts Falcao up top on his own on Sunday, he's ready and deserves a chance to start in his best position without a partner in his way.

2462~~~
Play the two of them from the start. Robin is far less effective on his own and from what I've seen of them so far, they look pretty good as a partnership.

2463~~~
The biggest compliment I can pay him today, is that for the 20 odd minutes he was on, we looked about 100x more threatening when we going forward, and we actually had someone who was holding up the ball and making defenders shit themselves every time he was near the ball.

2464~~~
Yeah, I think having both in the box at the same time with them combining their movement will cause mayhem.

2465~~~
to have RvP, Falcao and Rooney together...devastating..

if our defence solidifies...we will murder every team.

2466~~~
This. Di Maria is fecking wasted if there's no one attacking his crosses. Watch his Madrid highlight reels, Ronaldo and Benzema make proper attempts to get onto every single cross of his.

2467~~~
I think we can all agree that Falcao has by far the best chant at the moment. Incredibly addictive!

2468~~~
I think he was being rested for Chelsea. Maybe LVG was worried about how frequently our players are picking up niggles during matches and wanted to make sure he was available for Chelsea, or maybe he really wasn't match fit after the international break. He really needs to start against Chelsea because RVP is just a shell of his former self.

2469~~~
Really needs to start vs. Chelsea. RvP has looked off the pace this season.

2470~~~
It'd be lovely if he scores a hat trick against Chelsea again... one can only dream.

2471~~~
Because falcao has never finished a match this season... For united or colombia, i think there is some sort of plan\agreement to slowly nurse him back into fitness. Based in his record and current performance levels there is no other reason for picking rvp over him!

2472~~~
Using the diamond to accommodate 2 strikers is way too open against a team like Chelsea, the formation we played tonight is fine we just need to use Falcao as the loan striker instead of RvP.

2473~~~
Needs to start against Chelsea for sure.. He is our best striker as of now. Can understand why Van Gaal decided not to risk him,we need him against Chelsea and City..

2474~~~
I agree

2475~~~
I was thinking this as well. Very frustrating. 
Yeah, apparently he was jet lagged as well? I'm pretty sure he'll start against Chelsea. Whether Van Gaal drops Mata or Van Persie is another question.

2476~~~
He also played a lot this season for a player who missed last 9 month with cruciate injury

I think that he was just rested before a tough run of game and it's better for him to not overplay.

To me he made a good impact when he came on yesterday.

2477~~~
Right now, not devastating at all, but I'd worry more about playing Falcao than RVP since RVP  is pretty much invisible and can easily be marked out of the game.

I dont think he will ever find form like he did when he murdered us 4-1 in the SC, but would rather not face him.

2478~~~
Is that right? Been used fairly sparingly at United and it's not as though our games are coming thick and fast.

2479~~~
It probably suits him at United in that sense with the lack of games, less chance of a recurrance.

2480~~~
Falcao has started 3 games and made 2 sub appearances in close to two months for United.  He made just as many starts for Monaco as he has done for United this season.  Claiming he has played a lot for someone coming back from a cruciate injury is just wrong.   No one plays too often for United with our schedule.

2481~~~
He played against Everton, against West Ham, against Leicester, played the two match with Colombia, played the two first game with Monaco... Thats good for him, knowing that he came back on Friday from international

2482~~~
If anything, I'd say he could do with a few more games under his belt.

Looked ever so slightly ponderous last night IMO. Hopefully just the jet lag/ring rust.

2483~~~
I really hope he starts tomorrow. I'd be heavily disappointed if he is left on the bench in favour of Mata or Van Persie again. Even though he hasn't been setting the world alight yet he's been better than those two in his limited appearances and is bound to only get better. I know I'm far from the only one who wants to see this and if Van Gaal doesn't give him the nod it is bound to disgruntle the fans somewhat and pile added pressure on him for no good reason. Not to mention Radamel himself would probably start to feel slightly annoyed. So come on LVG, release the beast.

2484~~~
I've taken him out of my fantasy footy team, so I would imagine that should automatically make him score well tomorrow.

2485~~~
Really hope he starts tomorrow. The last time Cech and Cahill came up against The Tiger, they were absolutely mauled <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B-IYIef0zYI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2486~~~
I was expecting he had scored at least 7-8 goals by now. My fear is this will be a big flop.

2487~~~
Bit difficult to score if he's in and out of the squad, especially in place of a striker who is in far worse form than him. I'm pretty certain RvP will start tomorrow so it's iffy if he even gets to play Chelsea.

2488~~~
He has played a combined total of 251 minutes (equalling 2.8 games) and in that time he's got 1 goal and 2 assists (in 3 different games). It's probably Van Gaal easing him back in due to his lengthy injury.

Once he gets a consistent run of games going, he'll keep on firing.

2489~~~
Even so we'd only have him for the season and then let him go.

2490~~~
Hopefully he will start tomorrow but hard to see RVP being left out, maybe he will go with both and drop mata but it's probably more likely he will be on the bench again.

2491~~~
I hope he has done enough in training to get the nod ahead of RVP. His name on the team sheet would strike more fear than RVP in my eyes.
I can see him having a blinder tomorrow if he starts.

2492~~~
Same, well at least 5 <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2493~~~
With the total game time he's had ?

2494~~~
I hope he carries on his 'run of form' tomorrow, no doubt this will be the game he clicks into gear though. There is a bit of history given playing alongside Costa and us  supposedly being in for him  2 or 3 years ago.

2495~~~
Hope he starts but if we go with one striker, it'll somehow be RvP again.

2496~~~
until we start playing our best players in their best positions and stop bottlenecking our attack by trying to fit in big names, individuals with the power to carry us wont be able to. 

We have Radamel fecking falcao in our team yet we arent starting him uptop with a creative player in behind. boggles my mind. why cant we just bench van persie for a bit when he's clearly not with it right now, and hasnt been consistantly for a year.

2497~~~
Presuming he is fit and not picked up a knock since last weekend, will this be the first time LVG has had to choose between both 100% fit RF and RVP? RF's appearances have been hindered by match fitness and jet lag. I think (and pray) he starts. A stunning player and the best striker at the club.

2498~~~
He has to start tomorrow, RVP simply isn't putting in the performances we know he can.

2499~~~
He's defiantly got the most 'flopability' potential of all our signings. And the balance of probability would suggest that at least one of our 6 signings will fail. I mean, when has a team ever signed 6 players in one Summer, and they've all worked out?

2500~~~
Absolutely. He comes here as a grown man and with the potential to score anyting from 25-30 goals in a season for a top team like us. There should be no excuses. With his wages and status there should be no excuses - whatsoever! If we're happy with 15 goals we should have signed someone like Mario Gomez.

2501~~~
Hes played roughy 200 minutes, got 1 goal, 2 assists and has hit the post.

2502~~~
Let's hope LVG agrees with us. I'd be so optimistic if I see RF on the team sheet starting.

2503~~~
Hope he starts up top on his own tomorrow with Mata in behind, but I feel it's unlikely.

2504~~~
I dont think RVP puts that much fear into defenders these days, its been along time since we've seen a decent performace from him.

2505~~~
How about looking at the context ? He has played the equivalent of less than 3 games and you expected him to score 7/8 goals ? You're nuts my friend. No player on Earth can do that (except Ronaldo).

2506~~~
Hope he gets to score tomo', that would kickstart his career here. Don't know why, this signing and his performances remind me those of a certain Argie.

2507~~~
I actually think hes played very well when hes been on the pitch, one goal and two assists isnt a bad start, with more game time he will only get better. Im not quite sure what some expected.

2508~~~
It's not unreal at all my friend. And putting together game time is ridiculous because you surely have a bigger chance scoring goals in 9 games x10min compared to 1 game á 90 min. Just ask 2<b>0le</b>gend. Believe me, I am in love with Falcao and I believe he's among the 10 best players in the world* (best players in the world list below) and I want him to be our own tiger, but at this rate he's gonna leave us all with a very bitter taste. His price is just too high.

2509~~~
Hit the post? Are we becoming Arsenal now? Get in, we won a corner....???

2510~~~
Considering his injury, our shit teams, our changing systems from 3-5-2 to diamond formation, him being new in the league and the team and him not getting consistent game time. How could you have expected 7/8 goals ? That's some serious delusion and crazy expectation. Don't get me wrong, I can understanding expecting more from him because he's a striker but what you expected is just extreme when all things are considered.

2511~~~
Judging a player on 5 appearances (200 minutes). <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2512~~~
Even though it's not the point of the thread, not sure how mata, falcao and James are above silva, hazard and ibra.

2513~~~
Yeah thats my point <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2514~~~
Pretty sure he will start tomorrow. Did really well when he came on against west brom, whereas RVP was really poor (and has been all season). Really looking forward to seeing what he can do from the start, no that he's s got a bit of game time under his belt.

2515~~~
What a player been so impressed with him hadn't seen much off him before this season only had heard about him. Love him already he fills me with so much confidence can't wait to see him and Rooney against teams.

2516~~~
Considering what he did to Chelsea last time he met them - with some of the same defenders they have now - it would be an immediate psychological blow for them to face him again, he absolutely destroyed them in 45 minutes.

To start RvP over him is basically a sigh of relief for Chelsea's defence. Why would anyone do that?

I'll be really disappointed with Van Gaal if RvP starts the Chelsea game - and I'll be furious with him if RvP starts it with Falcao on the bench.

2517~~~
I reckon both RVP and Falcao will start.

2518~~~
No no no, they can't hind behind that argument us being a shit team - they are the team now!! We have bought 6 really good players, so there's no reason for us being shit. I think you need to drinking before writing on this forum my friend <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2519~~~
We will have to wait and see if he's fit enough for tomorrow, according to the official Twitter. Shite.

2520~~~
God fecking dammit.

2521~~~
I dream of seeing him leading the line by himself.

2522~~~
"He got a kick in the morning [on Friday] so we have to wait and see if he's fit enough," revealed Reds boss Louis van Gaal. "But it's not a knee problem.

"He had a knee problem but not anymore. We have to build Falcao up, that I have also said in the first press conference when he came to our club. 

"It is difficult because we are playing [games] already, that’s difficult but we have played him because I like the way he was playing so we play with two strikers. Now I have to choose between two strikers, even three because [James] Wilson can also play, the younger player."

2523~~~
Who the feck is kicking Falcao 2 days before a game? Bet it was Jones the clumsy tart.

2524~~~
Is he ever going to get going for us?

2525~~~
I'm starting to think Van Gaal just lies about Falcao so that Van Persie can play... This shit is getting ridiculous.

2526~~~
No. Never

2527~~~
Rumours of him out of tomorrow's game. I smell BS

Mind games folks....

2528~~~
Nice. Another game for him to get the last 30 minutes from the bench by which time Di Maria will be off the field and he'll be feeding of scraps again.

2529~~~
If he isn't able to play at all then the chances of beating Chelsea drop significantly I think. 

RVP hasn't done nearly enough this season.

2530~~~
His power would be crucial against a side like Chelsea.

2531~~~

2532~~~
I concur. Glad that's sorted. Good question Sam. Glad you asked it.

2533~~~
Yep, if that.

Its beyond frustrating. We really aren't gettin any luck this season at all. Infact, we haven't been getting any ever since Fergie left.

2534~~~
FFS Falcao better be fit. I hope this is just some silly mind games because I don't think I can deal with RVP again.

2535~~~
I always try and ask the best questions that get to the heart of the issue.

2536~~~
That basically sounds like confirmation RVP will be starting as a lone striker tomorrow...

2537~~~
I hope it's mind games because the thought of RvP playing lone striker again is depressing.

2538~~~
Shock start for Wilson? Doubt Chelsea will know much about the lad.

2539~~~
RVP at lone striker would be depressing. 

You would forget that he's even there with Terry and Cahill blanketing him all game.

2540~~~
If he's out then it'll be RVP on his own, which is a bit worrying. He's still capable of something special but he's been more of a hindrance so far this season.

2541~~~
feck

2542~~~
Fecking typical <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2543~~~
RVP, in the form he's in, up top on his own against Terry/Cahill. This aint ending well. 

The difference it made having Falcao on the pitch, even for those 20 minutes, against West Brom was so visible.

2544~~~
It's getting depressing to see RVP continue to start over Falcao....cmon Van Gaal, stop with the favouritism

2545~~~
fecking big Blow with Rooney out as well.

2546~~~
Not much he can do with Rooney being suspended, and Falcao not fit and now possibly injured.

2547~~~
Won't be surprised if Fellaini plays behind RVP actually.

2548~~~
Yeah, leading the line alone doesn't suit Wilson right now much either.

2549~~~
Feck it, lets stick Mata up front. He'd love a goal against Mourinho.

2550~~~
Shit.

I have a bad feeling about this.

2551~~~
Hmm...

2553~~~
In all seriousness though, if Falcao is on the bench for the majority of the game then I withdraw the optimism expressed in my 'we'll get something from both games' thread.

I'll also be suspicious that Van Gaal is making excuses for constantly playing RvP - silly as that sounds.

2554~~~
It's obviously RvP.
<span style="color: #ffffff">It probably was Jones.</span>

2555~~~
What? People are actually considering that Van Gaal is lying about Falcao in order to make excuses to play Van Persie?












Seriously?

2556~~~
RvP with his pipe and carpet slippers it is then.

2557~~~
But then i must ask Van Gaal....why has Wilson played for the U21's on Friday <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

2558~~~
This season is looking just as bad as last season in terms of pure shit luck. Give us a fecking break..

2559~~~
Slightly off topic but did anyone see van Gaal creaming himself over RVP in The Sun today?, does RVP know something dodgy about Van Gaal or something?

2560~~~
Well this news is disappointing. Makes beating Chelsea look more difficult considering RvP's form.

2561~~~
things don't look good for falcao... If his stop-start season continue throughout the season, I don't think we will buy him on a permanent deal.

2562~~~
You have to wonder if Van Gaal is reversing the "Costa" games on Mourinho..?

If that's not the case, I actually worry about his knee. With his holding his jacket over his knee and all the talk about his knee... Then he gets injured and van Gaal's first words are "its not his knee", it's only natural to think it's probably his knee.

2563~~~
He's been with us like a month.

2564~~~
It's way too early to write off RVP as a pipe smoking, slipper wearing spent force.

2565~~~
But we are still shit at the moment, it is what it is because no one can deny it.  I think you're the one who should stop the drinking and have some realistic expectations.

2566~~~
We have played in 7 out of 8 games with two strikers and it was just the last game, where Falcao was dropped in favour of RVP, because of jetlag and the change of the system we were playing. So why are some people on here assuming that RVP gets favoured? Rooney has been suspended in the last two games, Falcao played pretty much considering coming new into the team, coming back from a serious injury and playing international games on the other end of the world. Then we have young James Wilson, who also has been out injured and even though he looks exciting, is still inexperienced. We didn't have an awful lot of options, especially playing with two strikers for most of the time. Yes, Robin isn't in top form at the moment and could have done more in the past few games, no doubt about that, but reading some posts on here and in the Falcao thread, it looks like our new number 9 is setting the PL alight. The truth is sadly, that both of them have been playing roughly on the same level over the last few matches and that's far from the level of performances both players can achieve.

Falcao looked lively when he came on against West Brom, true story, but it was for the last 18 minutes of a chewy game against a tiring opponent and we changed our system with his introduction, to two men up front. If I remember correctly, RVP had that shot against the post and also began to look better in that period of the game. Don't get me wrong,  I'm not on team Robin or team Falcao and really couldn't care less about this never ending discussion, but it is just utter madness to suggest that LvG is favouring Robin without any football related reasons. Why would he do that? Because he is Dutch? Because they like each other? Does anyone really believes that kind of thing? Fact is, that RVP is a great professional and an extremely gifted footballer, who is having a bit of a dry spell at the moment. He did nothing extraordinary in the last few games, but he wasn't the worst player on the pitch either.

We will need goals and good performances from both players over the course of the season to be successful. I've seen some good understanding in a few moments between them and that's what we should be really talking about. They need time to adjust to new roles, in a new system and in a new team. It's a process and as they are both human beings, it can't be achieved overnight. In the end it's the managers decision to pick the players who are best suited to the game and give us the best chance of winning the game. If LvG decides to play just with one striker against Chelsea, it will be the player who is fit and has convinced him more over the past week. It's as simple as that.

2567~~~
Godamnit, so it's RVP in his current form leading the line.. awesome

2568~~~
Don't know why but ended up reading that post in a Vicky Pollard voice!! Some good points to be fair!

2569~~~
Smells like mind games of the highest order.

2570~~~
This. Why specifically release this bit of news separately, on Saturday night?

2571~~~
That's the first thing I thought as well when I read it.

2572~~~
I admit I projected my own drinking on you, because I was actually under the influence of alcohole when I wrote last night. However I still think my point is valid. What if every player in a relegated team said they couldn't play their best because the team mates were shit? They're all equally responsible. Had Falcao done his business we might as well had won those games. I'm willing to give him this season before calling him a flop. The potential is certainly there, but he can hardly blame the team for not getting it all out. It's not like the defence is going to help him put the ball in the net.

2573~~~
I will be very, very surprised if Falcao doesn't start.

2574~~~
Yeah sounds like we're pulling a Costa. And LvG saying he has to "choose between two strikers" makes it sound like we're definitely playing just one striker.

2575~~~
The thought of Falcao alone up top with no Mata or RVP makes me <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2576~~~
Where did he say this? Any links?
I think this thing about falcao getting a kick is an excuse to Give RVP another game. I think LVG is being sentimental here. May be i am completely wrong and he is bluffing and will play both. I do think the jet lag excuse last time and getting a kick excuse this time is maybe him trying out van persie in a lone striker. Then if this fails he will try same with Falcao. 
He will move to 4-3-3 eventually. This may be the begining.

2577~~~
Any ideas what his injury is if it's not his knee?

2578~~~
Apparently "Took a kick in a training on Friday" or something I read?

Please let it not be that bad, we need Falcao leading the line against Chelsea.

2579~~~

2580~~~
Big boost for us if true, he is the only  player in that United team I would fear if he were on today, even if he hasnt been  that great yet , theres always the chance he could be  against us.

2581~~~
Not di maria?

2582~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Jog on, Rob, you gimp. 

*Quoted to laugh at even further tonight after the game.

2583~~~
Not in the same way. I have a phobia of Falcao after the super cup, even if hes not the same player he clearly will have some of that still in him. Jose  who managed ADM for so long will know exactly how to take him out of the game.

2584~~~
Two out of Mata, RvP and Falcao will certainly play. We don't have enough midfielders otherwise.

2585~~~
Doesnt matter if you win, I still right now  find Falcao the only scary player for OUR  visit due to Joses familiarity with ADM.

2586~~~
Not necessarily, we could go with Blind, Herrera and Fellaini in midfield with di Maria and Januzaj/Young/Valencia out wide.

2587~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2588~~~
Same logic applied to managers and Van Gaal has Mourinho beat since he promoted him back at Barca.

2589~~~
Was wandering round wearing a Madrid shirt yesterday <span style="color: #ffffff">(yes pointless shit stirring)</span>

2590~~~
Supporting his compatriot in El Classico, what's your point?

2591~~~
Florentino will strike.

2592~~~
Beckham was wearing an Argentina shirt in the World Cup final, it's just simply supporting the team you want to win in that game, and of course his national team mate. No story here.

2593~~~
Didn't Rav Morrison often wear a Barca shirt out and about whilst he was with us?

2594~~~
Bit different but I still see no harm in what he has done, anyway.

2595~~~
Ya but he's a cnut.

2596~~~
This a lot more reasonable and I agree with you there. I expect and hope for much better.

2597~~~
Well to be fair to him, in his 3 starts he either scored or assisted every game... Even in the west brom game he was the reason the ball came to blind for the equalizer. He's been nowhere near his best but he's looked a threat and I think he'll be good here, and he'll only get better.

2598~~~
Potentially injured? I don't need this shit right now. We are not going to catch a break this season

2599~~~
Disappointing if he is out. I was hoping he would start up front on his own. Wouldn't be completely surprised if it's all BS though. The "kick in training" explanation is very vague. If it is true then RVP needs to bring his A-game that we know he has.

2600~~~
He and James are close pals, so this is a nothing really.

2601~~~
He needs to be putting in world class performances before we have to worry about Real looking for him.

2602~~~
<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Tigreeeeeee

I really hope you beat Chelsea today.

2603~~~
He's most likely injured out today. Took a knock in training on Friday.

2604~~~
Ouch. Rooney still suspended aswell?

2605~~~
Yep.

2606~~~
Not on the team bus according to Gary Neville.

Well it just seems like this year will be another long struggle. With a new team its so important that the players can play together for as many matches as possible. We haven't been able to achieve that in the slightest and its already the end of October.

I'd take fourth place right now.

2610~~~
So, two months into the season and the most we've got out of him in a game is what, 60 minutes?

2611~~~
Makes me glad we can cut the chord at the end of the season should this continue. We need to be getting 90 minutes out of him.

2612~~~
It's a knock in training mate. Not a re-injured cruciate! It's his first injury since he came and you want to "cut the chord"? What a joke.

2613~~~
I said, "it makes me glad we can cut the chord at the END of the season if this continues."

I said nothing about cutting the chord now. We just need to get more playing time out of him. I'm just glad that it's a loan with option to buy(I think that's how it is going to work anyway?), chill!

2614~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Of course you bloody would! Fourth place is a long way off and would be a great a achievement with the way the season's gone so far. 

Re Falcao. Struggled to get excited when we signed him and still waiting to be convinced it was money well spent after the clocks go back. Meh.

2615~~~
I was excited when we signed Falcao, would love to see him really start tearing up the league at some point this year, that's what I'm hoping for anyway <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2616~~~
He needs to be fit for these two games. Players play through knocks all the time, and these games are huge.

2617~~~
Short of being unable to walk-not playing due to a "knock" in a big game is concerning.

2618~~~
I think we're just playing it really safe with him. I'm sure he'll be fit and firing eventually, but if he's rushed back then his career is finished.

2619~~~
I'm just hoping he's not another forlan! <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2620~~~
Yeah, like Ozil did recently which worked out brilliantly for Arsenal.

2621~~~
I agree. He's seemed to be moving slightly gingerly since arriving. Then that photo of him covering his knee. Real *supposedly* pulling out of a deal with him, and the amount of time his medical took.

It's all a bit off.

2622~~~
If he has a legitimate knock, we are obviously doing the right thing in keeping him out...as it would be pointless to have him play half fit then re aggravate and also miss the City match and more.

2623~~~
If that is the case then we have an option to send him back to Monaco if he's injured.

2624~~~
And the irony of the Vidal and Strootman sagas-that both are reportedly on hold until they show their knees are OK. Meanwhile-Falcao gets a "knock."

2625~~~
Vidal/Strootman would also be here if their clubs would send them here on a year long loan.

2626~~~
True, but at present we're paying his wages for him to be 'handled with care', it seems a weird move.

I was made up when we signed him, but thus far we probably would've been better signing a prospect like Berahino or keeping Welbeck.

I'm starting to think there's something not quite right about the Falcao move - hopefully I'm proven wrong.

2627~~~
Jet lag and a knock in training. I'm starting to compile a list of reasons why he doesn't start.

2628~~~
Gutted for him. It's gonna take some effort for him to get into his stride and prove people wrong. Because it's only a matter of time before "flop" and "glass" start doing the rounds.

2629~~~
Just got home to see that he's injured and not in the team. Feck Our Lives.

2630~~~
exactly.

2631~~~
Same here. You've should've bought a decent defender and should've have kept either of Hernandez/Welbeck instead of getting him.

Anyway, he has still most of season left to prove himself.

2632~~~
I like the part where you ignore him saying "should this continue".

Then again, it's probably quite difficult to read properly from all the way up there on your high horse.

2633~~~
He wouldn't have started anyway. Step up James Wilson super sub.

2634~~~
I like the part where you ignore him even contemplating "cutting the chord" when his injury had nothing to do with his knee. Mine's a pony compared to yours.

2635~~~
Any update as to how serious the injury is?

Or if it was done by Jones? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2636~~~
During match one of Polish commentators said that he wad injured by one of his team mates during training. No idea where he got that information from but the plot thickens...

2637~~~
If it's a teammate then I'm not concerned. Mean it's not one of his long term injuries.

2638~~~
The fact hes on loan and hasnt cost a large fee kind of excludes him from being a flop in the Torres, Forlan kind of sense but it's more about fans expectations of him when he was first signed, there was a lot of over exaggerations, youtube compilations and hype. I was ridiculed for suggesting he may not be the same player he was 2 or 3 years ago do to age, league and injury, but  he does seem to need a lot of care. Still think hes more lethasl than RVP  at present though.

2639~~~
LvG said he took a kick on training Friday, so that's hardly a surprise <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

2640~~~
He hasn't even played a full 90 minutes let. I know you're not saying so nor is it your intention to imply it, but let's give him a tiny bit of time before we brush him off.

2641~~~
The thing is, we're 2 months into the season, and he still hasn't managed to play more then 60 minutes at a time for us. Thats got to be a worry.

2642~~~
Yeah, that's true. The signs are a bit ominous but I just really hope we can get him in the team for a while as early as we can just so we're not left halfway through the season trying to figure if he's going to be good enough or not.

2643~~~
Any update on his injury? Hopefully not too bad, he was sitting just behind the singing section yesterday - huge commotion in the east stand, practically missed the first 10 minutes of the game! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2644~~~
Well LVG downplayed any seriousness of it, saying he just got a kick in training. I expect he'll be back for the City game.

2645~~~
According to reddit/sport witness he could be out for weeks. Hope it's bollocks.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/topics/falcao-injury-is-strong-hematoma-to-calf-could-be-out-for-weeks-s" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/...ong-hematoma-to-calf-could-be-out-for-weeks-s</a>

2646~~~
Really hope it isn't major. We really lacked any sort of impact off the bench yesterday. I mean having Wilson come on is good but against the big teams it'd be nice to have better options.

2647~~~
As the following poster said I think this fact alone is cause for concern, but it may be he wasnt really bought with the intention that he would be a 30 goal a season player anymore but more cover and/or support.

2648~~~
No way of knowing for sure, but given his age, he's not like an Eto'o or Drogba signing. He's in his prime-and I suspect was contemplated for a starting XI role.  I'm disappointed he wasn't fit for yesterday's game. If he's still recovering from surgery-then United should be up-front about it.

2649~~~
Thank feck Rooney is back if he's going to be out for weeks

2650~~~
People will shout "injury prone", but it's really not his fault if someone has clattered him in training. Could happen to anyone.

2651~~~
F e c k how the hell are we going to manage anything, Jones dead as always and any player coming in for the tour of Carrington just comes down with the broken syndrome at the gate.. This is just turning on silly.

2652~~~
That's if the "impact injury" is the actual problem.

2653~~~
Errrrrrrr <img alt=":annoyed:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/annoyed.gif" title="Annoyed    :annoyed:"/>

2654~~~
Sports Witness is one of the worst things on the entire Internet. A site who's existence is fuelled entirely by conveniently cropped photos with click bait headlines. I hate it more than Hitler.

2655~~~
Bit much to be honest.

2656~~~
How much does Hitler hate it, though?

2657~~~
Nothing ground his gears like click bait. It's debateably what drove him to fascism.

2658~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2659~~~
Just seen the picture. What the hell was he thinking? fair enough he is supporting a mate, but wearing a Real shirt? (a team he was linked with all summer).

Could just have worn a Columbia shirt with James on the back. Think it is a bit thick myself, and he is supposed to be one of more intelligent footballers...

2660~~~
Who cares, its not as if he's wearing Liverpool shirt. 

Anyway whats the update on his injury?

2661~~~

2662~~~
Every time I get a notification that there is a new post on ''Radamel Falcao preformances'' I instantly burst into LOLOLOLOLOLOLOOOOOO Radamellllll Falcaooooooo! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2663~~~
Glad it hasn't turned out to be anything more than a knock, bit scary when players with long term injury issues miss a couple of matches. I want him to be starting games though ffs

2664~~~
hahaha, I sing that chant to myself contantly and my baby girl like it too, she's all smiles when I sing it to here, who needs baby songs when you have Falcao song. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>


Great news!

2665~~~
Same <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> so catchy.

2666~~~
Good news indeed. Should at the very least make the bench. Now just have to see if Fellaini keeps his place or Mata gets a game.

2667~~~
based on precedent, this news make me think that he'll be on the bench as opposed to the starting 11. good news regardless.

2668~~~
I've decided I want it as my ringtone.

2669~~~
Maybe that's exactly why he's walking around in a Real shirt...

2670~~~
To be fair he's not really walking around in it. He simply put it on while watching El Clasico to support his compatriot. Now, it's not my cup of tea but south americans are known to be very patriotic.

2671~~~
Will we see "James" in a United #9 shirt whilst watching the Manchester Derby? Doubt it.

2672~~~
Glad to see that he should be fit to play this weekend. I'm hoping that he starts, but I know that's a long shot at this point.

2673~~~
So wear a Columbia shirt. After being <i>that</i> close to moving to Real and knowing the culture of that club/Marca etc it's hard to see it as just a dumb move from a thick footballer - which Falcao isn't.

I dunno, the more time has passed the more odd I find this loan tbh. I'm glad he's here, and I hope he bursts to life for us, but something about it is just...odd.

2674~~~
Has this been discussed yet?

Source: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/radamel-falcao-manchester-united-ready-to-seal-permanent-transfer-of-striker-as-everything-is-complete-to-extend-his-old-trafford-stay-9827904.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...-to-extend-his-old-trafford-stay-9827904.html</a>

2675~~~
According to that article the £6 million loan fee will be on top of the £44 million transfer fee? Isn't his loan fee supposed to be deducted from his transfer fee if we make the move permanent?

2676~~~
Surely needs to prove himself as <i>robustly fit</i> over the course of an entire season before we even consider such a deal.

2677~~~
No point in sealing the deal now. Needs to put a string of games together first, and prove that he can play at the level expected level before that should even be a subject.

2678~~~
Yeah, I don't like the sound of signing him already. Give him the season to prove he's not only fit, but actually at the level we need.

2679~~~
For what it's worth apparently the picture of him in the Madrid shirt isn't actually him. No idea whether that's true, a newb has posted a link but it isn't in English.

2680~~~
I think they key part is "The deal is in place" it doesn't mean we will go through with it. I am a huge fan but if he can't get a shot up top over LvG's son then I don't see any point in that kind of outlay on him, he has to be a week in, week out starter for that price.

2681~~~
So far he hasnt had the impact on the PL, as most people thought he would have, I just hope he can replicate his athletico form with us, sooner than later

2682~~~
From what his agent was saying when we signed him, we agreed to buy him right there and taking him on loan first was just something to help with FFP.

I dont think its like the Tevez deal, I think we've already put the go ahead on buying him. There may be a way to opt out if hes injured all the time or something, but it'll probably cost money

2683~~~
Really want him to succeed here. He HAS to get going soon, because the British media are waiting to pounce with the usual 'flop', 'glass legs' etc..

It doesn't help with Van Gaal starting him on the bench and then subbing him off early every other bloody game. Desperately needs a full 90 minutes and a few goals under his belt as soon as possible.

2684~~~
Hopefully makes it off the bench on Sunday - he's looked a lot more dynamic than RVP this season and is definitely better suited to playing upfront by himself.

2685~~~
Going to miss the game on Sunday, disappointing that he hasn't been available very much. If worst comes to worst I'm sure we can get out of the permanent transfer though.

2686~~~
It's disappointing because of who he is. Radamel Falcao, only time will tell but I have a horrible feeling he's going to be a big disappointment here with regular injuries.

2687~~~
Paying 50 million pounds for a striker who will be 29, is this a good idea?

2688~~~
He'll now not have played a full 90 minutes for us until mid-november at the earliest. That's really odd.

2689~~~
It is. Especially after the long drawn out medical, Real pulling out of the deal with him etc.

I was really excited when we signed him but my excitement has been replaced by the feeling that something is just 'off' with the situation.

2690~~~
Most of the times the expensive transfers are the most profitable, as Real Madrid shows on a regular basis. 

I think it's far too early to judge him, because of his late arrival and niggling injuries. We shouldn't buy him just for the sake of it and I don't think we will, if he doesn't deliver the way we want him to. But that is the good thing with having him here on loan for the season. If he gets to the level he was or near to that, we hold all the cards to get him and if not, we can step back and didn't lose anything. I think he will come good, but as every other player, he needs to get a good run of games to get back to the level he is capable of. I can see him getting more and more important as the season progresses, but we shouldn't expect miracles as soons as he returns.

2691~~~
Think it was you that said at least one of our big signings would be a flop (on the basis that no manager ever has a 100% hit rate in a big spree like ours) and Falcao seemed like the most likely candidate based on no good reason other than a feeling in your gut. Something like that anyway. My gut feels similar.

2692~~~
No way he will be a flop, he's been brilliant for every club he's played for, so he isn't randomly going to start being crap here. He just needs a run of games and he will be scoring a lot of goals.

As for people asking if it's a good idea to sign him, we are going to have to sign another striker anyway, especially if we are back in Europe for next season. (I don't think Wilson is ready yet either) Falcao is also very marketable, I'm sure we will make more than his transfer fee on marketing him anyway, so I don't really see a problem with spending £44million on a world class striker.

Only thing that he annoyed me with is that photo he took with that Real Madrid top on, seems like he's still itching for a move to the Bernabeau, if that's the case then feck him anyway.

2693~~~

Did i miss something ??

2694~~~
Apparently that wasn't Falcao. From newbie forum :

2695~~~
Hernandez is still there, but to pay a total amount of 50 million pounds for someone who would be on the top of his peak and could decline very soon (while Rooney/RVP/Hernandez) are still at the club, I dont think that's smart. We also should be worrying about the FFP, Woodward already warned us that our revenue could decline a bit, and I reckon we will buy more than just Falcao.

2696~~~
It's discussed in the last page I think, there is a picture of him and his kid with Real tops on.

2697~~~
As it stands right now I dont think the club would make this deal permanent. Its not encouraging for Falcao

2698~~~
We can easily spend over £100million in the summer again regardless of performance during the season, the new kit deals we made generate a lot of money but obviously being in Europe would be preferable.

2699~~~
Do you have any basis for this massive assumption?

I have no idea how many extra Falcao shirts we would sell but I doubt we'd somehow make a profit on his transfer.

2700~~~
I think its more a James top then a Real top if you ask me .

2701~~~
I'm still not sure we ever actually signed him, he's always injured!

2702~~~
Harsh but true. We have to be prudent going forward and in the wake of Radamel's irregular fitness I'm leaning more towards the option of rejecting a permanent move which all things considered would represent a pretty short sighted investment given his fitness and age profile. Despite Falcao being an absolutely world beater when on song, as an example for about £50 million, we could try to replicate the successful Bayern model and acquire the trio of Reus, Firmino and Sule. The former 2 might be overkill but would inject some venom and dramatically upgrade our wide-ish attacking options in conjunction with Adnan and allow Di Maria to continue is his strongest midfield 3 role. The latter could be a 3rd/ 4th choice CB at first but has the talent to be as good as Ginter in a couple of seasons and maybe even Hummels or Boateng in 5. Something like that would speak of real value for money and give us a healthy core of good and potentially excellent players for the next decade or thereabouts, while allowing us to concentrate on other, more immediate areas of need.

2703~~~
Needs a ridiculous 2nd half of the season to even entertain the thought of buying him. Not fit and, tbh, not impressed when he does play (although obviously struggling for rhythm). The only worry i have at the moment is us letting him go and a rival snapping him up and being a beast for them.

2704~~~
Can't see us buying him even if he has a productive year this year. Hope he gets fully fit for the Arsenal game.

But yeah, seeing as he is 29ish, i doubt we would spunk that much money on him. We have other priorities. We could however take him on loan for another year to create a rent-a-player type deal like we had with Tevez (despite Falcao belonging to Monaco and not an agent).

2705~~~
From what i can piece together from various bits, it appears we've already signed him and the loan is a front/FFP dodge on Monaco's behalf. If that is the case, do all contracts signed up to this point reflect this, or is it still strictly an option to buy and we can pull out at the seasons end? Do we even know? Because some seem to think it's already done.

2706~~~
If we signed him, I hope its for significantly less than some of the numbers being thrown around.

2707~~~
Ask me again in May and I will give you more accurate detail on the finances regarding Falcao and how much money he makes for the club, I don't really want go of information this early, but his contribution in shirt sales and merchandising seems bright so far.

2708~~~
If it's true that many were worried about his knees, i.e Madrid pulling out, no other big teams interested, plus Monaco needing to get rid to balance the books it does put us in a fairly strong position. However, i'd be amazed if we're talking under £30-35m.

2709~~~
I think the fee is already agreed, another £44m apparently.

2710~~~
I saw a lot of places running with that but i'm not convinced tbh. After all, no-one seems to know anything about his wages either.

2711~~~
The thing for me with falcao is that his value will be dependent on this loan not only for us but for real or any other interested parties.  If we deem him worth enough of a 50 mil transfer,  more than likely someone would too.

2712~~~
I'm still not concerned. I just think this latest injury is just an unfortunate setback.

2713~~~
We don't really know about that, the press are liars. For example Shaw is apparently on half the wage they mentioned and the transfer fee is 12m lower.
And the same people who talked about this price were also mentioning a wage that Falcao never got in his life.

2714~~~
At least the next couple of Colombia games are in Europe, so he won't be jet lagged for the Arsenal game if he's over his injury.

2715~~~
Have to say thus far injury wise and luck wise its hard to justify that kinda outlay for me. Its early days of course but I'd be wanting late teens goal wise and an injury free run before even looking at a permanent deal.

2716~~~
Falcao has a lookalike who posed in the Madrid shirt the day of the Classico. Here's another one
<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/ugmlzdwmqf/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

2717~~~
Damn, she's nice...

Her mate in the red isn't bad either.

2718~~~
Been here 6 games since he signed, played in 4 of those. Injury prone...

2719~~~
Doesn't look good for him at the moment, does it? Missing 2 of our biggest games must feel awful.

He should have a ridiculously good second half of the season to convince us to sign him on a permanent basis. At the moment, it looks unlikely for that to happen.

2720~~~
Andriy Shevchenko would disagree with you there.

2721~~~
How far away is Falcao? Ok he is injured, but what injury and when will he be back? Why is no asking and answering that??
Someone please elaborate on this :-(

2722~~~
You really wonder why some posters are so quick to act like drama queens and write off players after 2 months. FFS....

2723~~~
Question is, can we sell him?

2724~~~
WTF are people talking about, did he not just get a knock in training or something? Could happen to anyone? He was out for a year and in the games he's played he looks like he's getting sharper and sharper. He's literally the best finisher in the whole world. Can we not just give him a chance

2725~~~
People are overreacting a bit.

2726~~~
Best finisher in the whole world? Ermm.

2727~~~
Who is so far ahead of him that that's an outrageous claim?

2728~~~
His reputation and stats would suggest he is in that category.

2729~~~
It wasn't completely gutteral. There was a vague rationale behind it. Shaw is too young to be considered a flop. He's here for 5-6 years at the very very least and we'll get something out of him. Blind & Rojo are too low profile to seriously be considered flops, at least to the media. If they fail they'll just fade into the background as we buy better players. Di Maria is too good to be a flop, and a bit like Beckham has the ability to be useful just from his delivery regardless of how he actually performs. His stats will always be good. Plus we've got him at a great age. So it's between Herrera and Falcao, and whatever Herrera becomes, he's at least a player we needed, and have needed for a very long time. Falcao is the odd one out. His profile, his age, his technically unneeded position in the squad are all just perfect for a flop story.

I still dont think he will be though. At least not really. He's got too much quality to actually be poor, and I think he's been decent in every game he's played. But in terms of easy media narrative, anything but a Costa like start to the PL puts him in the sights.

2730~~~
Messi/Ronaldo the obvious, and Neymar is starting to get there, he scores a goal every match and a lot of them are well taken, also doubt he is a better finisher than Ibra/Aguero.

2731~~~
So, he's missed two games from 'a knock' in training... But what's his <i>actual</i> injury.

I mean these are massive games, to miss them both and not even make the bench he must be properly injured - with what?

2732~~~
It's disappointing, because the game on Sunday is exactly the type of big, important game we signed him for, yet he's not available. Again. We haven't seen enough of him to make a judgement though, so we'll see.

2733~~~
Weirdly enough i wouldn't put Ronaldo in that category, like Robben they seem to need a "lot" of opportunities.

2734~~~
Yeah because he shoots from distance/unrealistic angles often, but if you give Ronaldo half a clear cut chance, he will get it in.

2735~~~
Is that a joke...Ronaldo needs about as many invites to score on the pitch as he does in bed!

2736~~~
What happened since the news he is fit for Sunday? Could someone fill me in.

2737~~~
I know, he is a great finisher, but for some reason and probably the one you mentioned, Ronaldo wasn't on my list of great finishers.

2738~~~
Are you for real? We talk about someone who has not played a single full 90-minute match for us so far. For me, it's unacceptable that he has not managed to rack full matches by now. Considering how THIS could be the biggest game of the season, what can be the nature of his injury so that he cannot take an injection to cope with pain?

A little off-topic and possibly over-ranting, but that Neanderthal named Phil Jones can go feck himself if he's involved anyhow in this.

2739~~~
Where does one start with that?

2740~~~
What can he do if he wasn't?

2741~~~
Aguero, Messi, and Costa and Ronaldo are currently better.

2742~~~
Let's be honest, to spend 50M on a 29yo he has to be at Messi/Ronaldo's level.

2743~~~
Not all injuries can be treated with painkilling injections. And even if it were possible, it might do him further damage which, given his already lengthy injury record, could be a risk too far.

2744~~~
That was how it seemed to me as well, but I guess I am going to need to see him given a run of starts to see we do plan on keeping him, as I can't see us dropping that kind of money on an option.

2745~~~
Really?!

He's been here for 6 matches!  Put aside the first, in which he came off the bench as expected, and it's three starts and one sub appearance before getting injured for one match, which is about to become two matches.

In the three starts he scored one and assisted two.

How on earth can you call him injury prone or out of form based on that?

2746~~~
What is actually wrong with you people?

Am I missing something, is Falcao the first player ever to be injured or something?  Do you expect him to chose which games he's injured for?

2747~~~
I just think it's odd that his actual injury isn't being stated. He's missed the two biggest matches of the season because of 'a knock'...

A knock that did what?

2748~~~
My god, its like bunch of hysterical women are posting here. Not to mention experts on injuries...

2749~~~
He's been here 6 games...

2750~~~
So what are you saying, club is hiding the 'actual injury' cause its a bad, bad one..?

Let me get this right, after 6 games you concluded he wont have a ridiculously good 2nd half of the season?

2751~~~
Not moaning but for the supposed wages were paying him, we arent getting a good deal so far, but obviously I really hope once hes fit, we will get best of him

2752~~~
I think it's only fair to look at Falcao before the injury. The handful of appearances after being out for 10 months isn't much to judge him on. And before then he was banging them in like the 4 mentioned. We brought him to the club as an elite finisher and just because he's missed some chances in a few sub appearances for us doesn't mean he's not an elite player

2753~~~
Welcome to the Caf <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I'm quite disappointed to not see a lot of him yet. Still think he'll be doing well for us.

2754~~~
Must have been some "knock."  My BS detector is starting to ring.

2755~~~
I'm not saying he won't, but that it just looks unlikely at the moment. There's no hint of previous injuries having his impact on his performances, but he appears to be lacking confidence whenever he plays. Of course getting injured is unfortunate, but missing crunch games we needed him the most in, is just cruel. A goal or two in these games for him would have changed a lot of people's opinion about him. Again this could go either way I believe and I really wish he turns out to be excellent, but I wouldn't surprised if it didn't work out.

2756~~~
And for the record, I hate that culture of silence when the manager cannot explain why a player who is supposed to be one of our main assets (for the wages he gets) has to sit out of the 2 biggest games of the season by a country mile so far. It cannot be just 'a knock'; that's BS.

2757~~~
I just saw on reddit that the picture about him watching the El Classico in a Real shirt is fake. It was just some lookalike called Carvajal Andres. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://instagram.com/carvajalandres24" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://instagram.com/carvajalandres24</a>

Phew!

2758~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2759~~~
I've really got no idea where this conspiracy theory is going... but I'm intrigued to find out!

2760~~~
This fella could get Falcao in all sorts of hot water if he pulled the same prank with a Liverpool or City kit.

2761~~~
Falcao has run off with the Illuminati?

That's why he's not available really, Mendes is trying to get Woodward to sign that Falcao lookalike but LvG has uncoded a series of clues that have revealed that RvP is, in fact, a descendant of Jesus...

2762~~~
People questioning how a knock can keep a player out for a week - did you just start watching football in September? Have you seriously never heard of a player taking a knock and missing games?

We have rooney, rvp and falcao and pay them 800,000 a week for a reason, one being injured isn't the end of the world

2763~~~
Two weeks, minimum.

2764~~~
Neanderthal is the word that comes to mind reading that alright.

2765~~~
Yep.

2766~~~
Oh my...How much wages is he on per week? 

I think we must seriously consider giving him a permanent deal.

2767~~~
It's very disappointing that he seems to be injured constantly. If he isn't signed yet then I hope we approach any potential deal with care. If he is signed then I hope he sorts himself out and can start playing 90 minutes regularly.

2768~~~
Technically he's still on loan, so basically he's not even our player yet, so both technically and basically there's no reason to panic... or just go support Arsenal and start believing that Danny Welbeck will win you a title.

2769~~~
Ah the newbs. How I've missed you.

2770~~~
"Cmon Danny!"

2771~~~
Is he out for the derby game?

2772~~~
Yep. Confirmed by van Gaal at the press conference.

2773~~~
I have a feeling he will play sunday.  We kept shut before chelsea and now he is all open makes me doubt it.  

Rooney and falcao replacing rvp and mata from last match.

2774~~~
I'd rather he didn't if he hasn't been fully training all week. Better to allow him to return at his own pace and be available for Arsenal.

2775~~~
Hard to see RvP being replaced. It was probably his best game for us for the season.

2776~~~
Really hope he gets a run of games....

Forget United, the guy is pure class! To have him in the league is outrageous! Hopefully, he'll kick on and get starting sooner or later.

As a football fan, it's pure bliss to see people like him, playing in the league you support....Never mind your own team.

Worth the price of a trip with players like him....Was lucky enough to see him play for Porto in the EL final in Dublin. Just pure class.

2777~~~
FFS no journo had asked LVG what sort of injury Falcao got, therefore no one knows how long he will be out for

2778~~~
You do know the English press right?

I agree with you btw

2779~~~
Why don't you find out what his injury is before spouting rubbish?

2780~~~
Speaking from first hand experience? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2781~~~
Van Gaal has often mentioned not wanting to risk injured players.

The one time he does, with Herrera, it's a complete disaster and he's injured again.

That's the sort of kharma United tends to have, though. When we make a bad mistake we're punished because when you do things the right way the gods are harsh to keep you on the straight and arrow.

The mental hard bastard that goes from club to club hacking tendons off the opposition with impish glee is the one who's never injured. But he probably has three kids with different women and lives in someone's garage.

In Buddhism, when you've cleared your dharma from your past lives all you have left is your kharma from this life. When you have little kharma left you get a phenomenon called "instant kharma", where whatever kharma you create comes back to you very quickly.

I'm suggesting United has attained such a blissful state of existence.

2782~~~
The most hilarious thing about that post is that he quoted a post ridiculing the hysteria and then proceeded to add some of his own <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2783~~~
It's a shame, but atleast we took the option of the loan first. That was a smart move IMO.

Falcao was worth taking the risk on, but if he becomes a crock 6M is nothing to worry about.

2784~~~
Why did anyone not ask any details about the injury. LvG that Falcao is still injured. There was no mention of what and when he should be fine.
Is this worrying anyone else?

2785~~~
Even if he only kicks on and hits top form in the second half of the season it'll be worth it. Could come in very handy for the Christmas fixtures where the games come thick and fast and we will need a higher degree of rotation than normal. Unfortunate that he has taken a knock just after getting his first goal for us at a time when it looked as if he was slowly coming into form, but I still reckon he will be good for us over the course of his loan spell.

2786~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/radamel-falcao-manchester-united-ready-to-seal-permanent-transfer-of-striker-as-everything-is-complete-to-extend-his-old-trafford-stay-9827904.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...-to-extend-his-old-trafford-stay-9827904.html</a>

Isn't it a bit odd this?  Agreeing to spend £44m on an injury prone 30 year old striker that has only scored one goal so far?  An injury prone striker that is currently injured?

2787~~~
30? He is currently 28 and will be 29 come the summer.

2788~~~
The fee is agreed, doesn't mean we will pay it at the end of the year.

2789~~~
Although his aggent suggested we'd already put the go ahead on it and its a formality

2790~~~
He's currently injured but isn't an injury prone. Injury prone players are players who get injured many times during the years, and this isn't a case for Falcao.

He's also 28.

2791~~~
I'm sure, that doesn't mean it's sealed. 

If he only manages to play 15-20 games for us this season and finish half of them, I don't see us signing on the dotted line.

2792~~~
No need to panic with Falcao, the guy was out of the game a long time before signing for us, he's bound to pick up niggling little injuries as a result. Plus he's settling into a whole new league and country... Wait until after Xmas and I'm sure that he will get a run of games and start banging the goals in. If he doesn't, then we just don't buy him at the end of the season (which wouldn't be the end of the world, 40m plus for a 29 year old is a lot of money even in today's market). 
I know it's frustrating not getting to see our shines new toy ripping the place apart every week but let's be realistic with him.

2793~~~
it's not that I'm being a nervos Nelly-but I'm concerned that a player coming off ACL surgery misses 2 big games due to a "knock" in training. 

ACL recovery does not necessarily happen in a straight line. So-yeah, I'm a little paranoid that we're not getting a straight story. And, if he is injured it means we are thin at striker because we got rid of Hernandez and Wellbeck assuming Falcao would get plenty of playing time. 

I hope that all of the posters saying he'll be back and good as new are right-but that doesn't mean I can't be skeptical at the moment.

2794~~~
Falcao isn't injury prone. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2795~~~
It seems more to do with genuine lack of luck than actually being injury prone. He still has a long time left in the season to go, let's hope he completely recovers before the turn of the year.

2796~~~
I won't be making a call on Falcao until much nearer the end of the season.

2797~~~
More than one injury in a certain period of time= injury prone on the caf.

2798~~~
Splitting hairs a bit there!

2799~~~
Not really. You just added on a whole year to his age for some reason and I corrected you. It's not like he will be nearly 30 either. You also called him injury prone (which is completely wrong) but I let that slide.

2800~~~
At this very moment he is. I would be very much if the opinion to wait until next summer to decide on making it permanent or not

2801~~~
We are not going to pay 50 m for him. We may have a agreement, but who else is going to pay that amount?
All we would need to do is pay what someone else is going to pay.

2802~~~
Thing is, unless RvP or Rooney are off in the Summer, there's no point in having another big name number 9 in the squad because LvG plays RvP for 90 every game and Rooney is his captain.

I love Falcao, but is it worth it for us...or him?

Perhaps we'd be better off spending 25m on a Berahino and putting the money we save into strengthening our defence or midfield.

2803~~~
A lot of rubbish being spouted in here.

If the club is close to arranging a perma deal for Falcao then I think they know far better than any of us having seen him train and play every day since his arrival!

He will be great here. He has looked good when on the pitch so far this season. Hardly like he has become our Balotelli!

2804~~~
No one doubts his class, but we all remember Hargreaves.

It's certainly not beyond the club to sign a high profile player who's effectively crocked.

I think the doubts expressed by people in here are justified - he was signed after an extremely lengthy medical and declared totally fit after a serious injury, yet he's still not played 90 minutes with pretty odd excuses as to why.

The doubts aren't helped by the fact that he's looked to be moving gingerly at times and that photo of him awkwardly covering up his knee - perhaps nothing to do with anything, but when you put it all together it's totally understandable why fans are concerned.

2805~~~
Some did suggest that we've essentially already bought him next summer and that we don't have an option. Not sure how true that is though.

Personally, I didn't see the point of us even signing him on loan. I was confused at the time. When I knew it was happening, I got excited but I still find him being at the club strange.

2806~~~
I haven't seen him moving gingerly at all

2807~~~
His movement when he was been on hasn't been the Falcao of old. As a player I followed due to our interest in him I noticed straight away he  seems to have lost a bit of pace and explosiveness

2808~~~
People giving up on him already. 

Astonishing..

2809~~~
How'd you get that? 

Showing concern's pretty much the opposite of giving up, isn't it?

Giving up would be most people's feeling toward Anderson - ambivalence. Don't see anyone on here showing any sign of 'giving up' on Falcao at all.

2810~~~
Exactly what I meant. It's never too much asked for the media to do whatever it takes in order to get the info. Everyone wants to see Falcao on a football pitch, so it's the media's job to dig up info on his situation, even if that means laying traps in press conferences or getting more concrete stuff from inside sources.

Says it all. I still have nightmares about the whole spell with Owen Hargreaves.

2811~~~
More detective work regarding the Madrid jersey. Courtesy newbie forum :

2812~~~
I'm exactly seeing that, 6 games, 2 games missing and people are already saying we shouldnt buy him. 

Not to mention all of a sudden he moves 'gingerly', whatever that means and he's not the old Falcao anymore.. Supposedly..

2813~~~
Will judge this guy after 20 odd games. But so far I've been impressed by him when he has played and if there is better to come he will be amazing! Not sure the fuss he hardly had a run at it!

2814~~~
It was seemingly to do with ffp, the club now get the transfer fee in this financial year as apposed to the last. They can then add it the their allowed incoming transfer budget, or some such.

2815~~~
I think Falcao has done well and been involved in alot of the chances we have created. His movement is great and he is always a threat. I hope he will be back soon because any team would be happy to have a player like him in the team.

2816~~~
Is he defonout of today's game?

2817~~~
Did you watch Falcao much before his Monaco stint?

If so, do you think he looks the exact same player? And do you think he moves the same?

2818~~~
How much did you watch him? 

Are you an expert on movement?

2819~~~
Answer my question before asking your own.

2820~~~
Sitting there looking absolutely stunning.

2821~~~
Coolest looking footballer on Earth.

2822~~~
Yes. 
Your turn.

2823~~~
Looking smooth today sitting with young Pereira watching the game. I still fully believe he will fire for us and will give us more as Wilson is developing than RvP who is 3 years older.

2824~~~
Concerns are growing louder...

2825~~~
What do you mean?

2826~~~
More then two months into the season and he's still nowhere near fitness, and has yet to play more then 60 in one game.

Add that to the knee injury, and its worrying imo.

2827~~~
Ah ok, I thought you were referring to an article or something.

Yeah, it's disappointing, and I agree that it does seem a bit weird, one excuse after another it seems. The deal has a funny feel to it so far.

But I say give it 'til Christmas, if by then this nonsense is still going on then it's definitely cause for concern. But I'm clinging to the hope that within the next month he's gonna really burst to life.

2828~~~
Another 7 months for him to potentially make the difference between top 4 or not. I'm not worried.

2829~~~
For me, he's got a lot to prove over the next 7 months to show he worth the (reported) £50 million transfer fee. Not just with his form, but with his long term fitness as well.

2830~~~
Does anyone else feel like the club may be playing down the true extent of his injury? Maybe iv just became a conspiracy theorist but I have a bad feeling about his injury for some reason, We could really do with him aswell at the moment

2831~~~
What actually is his injury? Is it a calf or am I imagining that?

2832~~~
'A knock' is all the info that's been given over the last two weeks.

2833~~~
Well that's the thing, we have had little word at all from the club in regards to it, only that it was 'minor', Yet he has missed 2 games now

2834~~~
Thanks for that.

Yeah it does seem a bit weird. If he misses another then I will be concerned. Should be at least on the bench if it was only a 'knock.'

2835~~~
He was fine until the international match he played recently. 

Perhaps he got a hard kick on his operated knee, and if it was swollen they are taking no risks.

I would rather he sat out of 2 games than miss half the season with it being re-injured.

2836~~~
It's almost as if we didn't sign him. Pundits have even forgotten to mention him. It is worrying indeed.

Really hope he returns with a bang asap.

2837~~~
People worried about the state of his injury ,considering he was crocked before we signed him.

2838~~~
One thing is being worried another is already panicking he has some kind of really bad injury and wishing we dont buy him.

2839~~~
Any idea if he will be back for Saturdays game?

2840~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> He played over an hour against Leicester, West Ham and Everton.

2841~~~
Think I read sports witness tweet that it was badly bruised and would be a few weeks. So either next weekend or the week after internationals.

2842~~~
Praying he's not another dud. Really need him asap. RvP lul is a major concern

2843~~~
United will not sign him on a permanent basis if he can't stay fit. Fairly sensible tbf.

2844~~~
Isn't Lady man the one that constantly gets everything wrong and is hated by every United twitter account?

2845~~~
Show concern at the end of the year, not 2 months into a deal. Looking at our injury history, can you really be surprised a guy who had such a major injury at the start of the year which led him to missing the world cup is still not fit? Ffs, we took Victor fecking Valdes in to recuperate, we must have <i>some</i> sort of plan of recovery for these bloody players!

2846~~~
That's Jamie Jackson.

2847~~~
Link?

2848~~~
How severe is his injury? Is there a possibility he's back for Palace?

2849~~~
Just seen it on twitter, apparenty both The Sun and The Mail have run stories that Van Gaal is concerned over Falcao's ability to adapt to the PL.

2850~~~
I actually thought he looked decent in general play. It's just his fitness I am concerned with...unless LvG means his adaptability in terms of the physical stuff and the toll it will take on his body.

2851~~~
From his (albeit brief) appearences for us so far I don't think this is an issue at all. He looked better than Van Persie - stronger, faster, more determined, held up play better etc. - and RVP's been in the league for what, 10 years now? If there is an issue with Falcao it'll be to do with injuries.

2852~~~
I take this as LvG telling Falcao to get off the treatment table and get on the field. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2821086/Louis-van-Gaal-fears-Premier-League-bee-physical-injured-Radamel-Falcao.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...ague-bee-physical-injured-Radamel-Falcao.html</a>

2853~~~
It would help if he wasn't yanked off after 60 minutes in every start despite RVP being woeful... Now that the tough games are out of the way though, he'll probably be back in. The only way I can see him keeping his place in the arsenal game is if he scores a hat trick, and even then it wi pro probably be in a diamond so that RVP keeps his place as well.

Before he came, I had heard so much about LVG's strength of character and not pandering to ego but it seems he has alarmingly mellowed. Hope he realises what is needed and soon, because Falcao deserves more of a chance than he has had so far, especially as he has been better than RVP when both have been on the pitch.

2854~~~
Oh dear <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>



I think there are still around 30 matches to go for us this season, including the FA Cup. Let's just hope Radamel finds his fitness as quickly as possible.

2855~~~
Columbia Manager as said that that he will not be counting on Falcao in the upcoming friendlies .

2856~~~
Weird how PL is physical for Falcao when he actually looked fine in whatever matches he played.

2857~~~
Physio room says he is back in squad for Palace

2858~~~
The reason we signed him on loan is that he failed his medical. We will only sign him permanently in the summer if he can prove his fitness.

2859~~~
I don't believe that, why would the Club risk paying his wages if he failed his medical? I'd say the reason we got him on loan was more to do with FFP on Monacos end.

2860~~~
Surprised really if true as even though I had my doubts about  this version of Falcao, struggling to adapt to the PL  was not one.

2861~~~
Not sure how people have come to the conclusion that he has struggled to adapt to the PL when he's hardly played, don't think he's played a full 90 yet? He's looked good in glimpses to me, it's just a matter if he can stay fit.

2862~~~
Pretty much this, unless my understanding of 'physical' is simpyl wrong, how can a man that couldn't be dispossessed by several players at the same time ( it was against Everton iirc ) due to him simply holding them off, blocking them off and not being muscled out fail the 'physical' part of EPL? It's not like he's the slowest striker we have as well.

2863~~~
If he cant remain fit then there's no point in signing him. Actually I am a bit concerned about us signing a 29 year old striker when we already have Rooney and RVP. Id rather see us sign someone younger for less money and focus the investment to defense and midfield.

2864~~~
I think he just has to get fit, if he isn't ready for Palace then I will be a little worried.

If we don't sign Falcao, who is out there we could go for?

2865~~~
I've seen a few things on Twitter (which I imagine are garbage) saying that United are set to axe Falcao's loan deal due to "continuous injuries". He's had one injury since being here, has he not? If it's a bruised foot, he's probably taken a hard kick or gone under someones studs. It's not about being injury prone, as that kind of impact would injure anyone.

2866~~~
Wouldn't mind Paco Alcacer if Van Gaal plans on continuing with the diamond.

2867~~~
He's managed to out-ponderous Robin Van Ponderous so far this season so I'm not sure about that.

I'm hoping it's down to a lack of fitness but I would say he's got an excellent case for being our slowest striker. Beggars belief that we've only got two strikers in our squad capable of out-running all but the slowest CBs. And one of them is an injury prone teenager. Ridiculous.

2868~~~
Not a single quote from Van Gaal just speculation from sources which sounds like utter fecking bollocks. Out of all our strikers and that includes Rooney he has looked the most sharp, the most strong and the most intelligent and this is coming from someone who loves Robin van Persie. So I don't know where this BS has come from. If Van Gaal has said this then maybe he needs to stop yanking Falcao off and stop using him as a sub. I'm not happy at all with how he has played Falcao, he's not had a full 90 minutes yet.

2869~~~
Cue Falcao Hattrick against palace

2870~~~
Weird that the excuses given are that he's struggling with the physicality of the PL when actually the fact that he's handled the physicality so well, and so quickly, has been one of the things that surprised me about him the most. He's shielded the ball well, his hold up play ha been good and he's done a good job playing with his back to goal with defenders tight to him. It's a weird reason. 
Also I wonder if he has had a further injury setback because just last week didn't the club brief that it wasn't his knee, it was just a minor knock?

2871~~~
He's looked strong as an ox but hasn't really looked up to speed with the pace of the game. So I guess that's what people mean. There were rumours immediately after the "minor knock" that he'd done some significant damage to his calf muscle and was awaiting a scan. Guess we'll find out more on Friday.

2872~~~
Is he even fit?

2873~~~
Apparently he is according to physio room

EDIT: Actually it was in the paper and they mentioned physio room, but that only says Evans will be back not Falcao <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2874~~~
I was under the impression he would return for Palace. physioroom says "no return date" <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2875~~~
Only way to find out is on Friday's press conference.

2876~~~
He's looked energetic and held the ball up well in what I have seen. Obviously his fitness is an issue but hopefully he can get through it. RVP seems to go missing after 45 minutes and we need a world class striker that can sustain performances.

2877~~~
His fitness was always going to be the biggest concern. To join United with their incredible injury record might not be the best idea for physio fragile players like him

2878~~~
It’s going to be difficult for him at 29, in a new club, in rebuilding, to find his best form. I thought that it was a smart addition to the squad with this loan, but for the few games he played he looked ok but not world class.

He has yet to reach his top level, and now he’s injured it’s going to be even difficult for him. He has to compete with LVG’s favorite, Van Persie for a starting spot. So it’s a big big challenge for him. Whether he’ll be back on form or RVP will be boosted by him, or neither, we’ll have to wait and see.

2879~~~
A player who has suffered from injuries in recent times moving to Man Utd is like sending a recovering alcoholic to Oktoberfest.

2880~~~
I think that's all true and when you take into account his age, the fee and his recent injury you have to question if it is worth signing him permanently. He needs to get in the team and start scoring goals fairly quickly otherwise I don't see him being here next season.

2881~~~
Would like to see the EPL adopt a system similar to one used in the NFL where teams provide information about a player's likelihood of participating in a game-adds more transparency. Hard to know how sites like physioroom get their information. Falcao's return date on that site changed from November 8 to "no date."  As I haven't seen anything from the club-how could they know?


In any event, I'd be even more suspicious that we're getting a straight story from United if Falcao is unavailable for this week's game.

2882~~~
It's the same for Rafael, Evans and Jones, who are out injured and we don’t know until when. It’s more down the clubs and their willingness to communicate on injuries. Football has changed and information are more and more difficult to collect

2883~~~
How does that work then?  Surely they can just say whatever they want?

2884~~~
No, they can get investigated if they seem to be giving false information.

Think it was brought in due to clubs using inside information on betting - i.e. say that a key player is injured to influence the odds and then place money on them winning via associates

2885~~~
Here's a link to an article explaining the process. In principle there are sanctions if teams provide inaccurate information.  Nonetheless, there's some gamemenship. But, introducing such a system would be an improvement over what we have now.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.ehow.com/list_6714978_nfl-injury-report-rules.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ehow.com/list_6714978_nfl-injury-report-rules.html</a>

2886~~~
Falcao is tremendous player when fit. I'm hoping he's being eased in. We need his goals.

2887~~~
The Mail article also says that we are keen to recruit a world class goal scorer next season, but if that isn't Falcao then I don't have a clue as to who it might be. Maybe Madrid might want to take a punt on Falcao and then Benzema would be available but I highly doubt that. There aren't many top class strikers available, are there?

2888~~~
If (!) Van Gaal doesn’t believe in Falcao’s fitness, a typical move would be… not signing anyone but bringing back Ángelo Henríquez from Dinamo Zagreb; and as far as we know that is exactly what he wants to do. Of course Henríquez is still young and he hasn’t played on the big stage yet, but that is how Van Gaal is working as far as I have understood his way of coaching.

(Remember the situation at Bayern a few years ago, when the bosses wanted to spend big money for a new player and Van Gaal said: “No, I have seen this young guy called Alaba in our own youth team. I will try with him.”) With Rooney and Van Persie around – and Van Gaal seems to have unbelievable trust in Van Persie –Henríquez could grow in the “shadow”.

However, the case of Falcao becomes weird. Yesterday, his return date was 8th Nov, wasn’t it? And now it says no return date? If he is not playing against Crystal, let’s hope it’s only a precautionary measure.

2889~~~
Saido Berahino. Fast, two footed, natural finisher, young, English.

Also he would cost around half of what Falcao would cost...and then there's the wages.

2890~~~
Have to be aware of the one season wonder syndrome that seems to strike young English players with alarming regularity. I do like him, however, from what I've seen.

2891~~~
What is Falcaos actual injury btw?

2892~~~
'A knock'.

If he's out for another week I'm sure the club will have to be more forthcoming with the details.

2893~~~
If you ask me, I'm all for the implementation of such system. Personally, I wouldn't mind the authorities striking at United with such sanctions for not providing information to their own fans about a player's recovery update.

When I think of the Falcao situation, it is fecking depressing that we don't get more news about his injury. He should be playing as our lone striker instead of Van Persie, end of.

2894~~~
No Falcao again this weekend according to Mark Ogden.

2895~~~
oh ffs.

2896~~~
Bloody hell. Fcuking frustrating. He won't be "match-fit" until January at this rate.

Thanks to bloody Phil Jones.

2897~~~
Can we <i>please </i>stop this nonsense?

In the absence of a single shred of evidence that Jones had anything whatsoever to do with Falcao being crocked, it's getting kind of tiresome to see him still being blamed.

2898~~~
Who knows whether or not this might relate to his cruciate ligament injury? If it does, he could be out a lot longer yet.

2899~~~
This is the kind of post that leads to, 2 or 3 pages later:

"Can't believe his knee is fecked again"

2900~~~
It's got nothing to do with Phil Jones.

My mind goes back to that bizarrely lengthy medical and the now infamous 'covered knee' photo...

I'm cynical and probably being paranoid, but I'm starting to get a bad feeling about Falcao, and indeed <i>for</i> Falcao - the guy seems like such a nice fella who was overjoyed to be here.

When strikers don't hit the ground running at a new club their chances of success are lower, especially at United, and especially in those approaching 30.

It's embarrassing for the club if he's turned up here crocked and we're basically just paying his wages for a season so he can sit in the treatment room.

2901~~~
Based on Ogden's reporting, the "knock" story is becoming less plausible.

It appears nonsensical now, as Radamel Falcao battles for form and fitness at <b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Manchester United</a></b>, but the Colombian forward harboured genuine hopes of appearing at the World Cup this summer, just five months after suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury. 

Falcao tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while playing in Monaco’s French Cup tie against Monts d'or Azergues on January 22. 

Yet having performed surgery on the player three days later, surgeon Jose Carlos Noronha raised the prospect of a swift return in time for Brazil by claiming the operation, ‘went well and the light at the end of the tunnel isn’t small’. 

Jose Pekerman, the Colombia coach, even included Falcao in his provisional 30-man squad for the tournament before reluctantly cutting the country’s most iconic player from his final 23-man selection on June 9. 

Now contrast Falcao’s unwinnable race against time with the road to recovery taken by Arsenal winger Theo Walcott, who suffered the same injury as the United striker – a torn anterior cruciate ligament – on January 4.

</ul>Walcott missed the World Cup – he was never given a hope of making Roy Hodgson’s squad once the injury was confirmed – and only returned to action for his club at the weekend, with a ten-minute substitute appearance against Burnley at the Emirates. 

The 25-year-old is regarded by Arsene Wenger as still being some distance from full fitness, with the Arsenal manager determined to ease Walcott back into action gently. 

Falcao has not been afford the luxury of similar patience, however, and the player and United are both losing out as a result of that. 

With Monaco’s finances dictating that Falcao’s £335,000-a-week wages had to be offloaded this summer, just 12 months after his £53m arrival from Atletico Madrid, the forward found himself back in action at the beginning of August when he played and scored against Arsenal in the Emirates Cup in London 

His move to United followed at the end of the month, but to date, Falcao has made just five appearances – three starts and two from the bench – and scored one goal. 

He has missed the last two games with a calf injury and will not be fit to face <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/crystal-palace/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Crystal Palace</b></a> at Old Trafford on Saturday. 

Three months into his loan move, which is costing United a £6m loan fee and £265,000-a-week in wages, Falcao is beginning to resemble an expensive gamble, particularly with Danny Welbeck giving Arsenal plenty of value for money following his £16 million arrival from Manchester. 

United have already agreed a fee with Monaco and personal terms with Falcao over a permanent move to Old Trafford next summer, but the question now is how long it will take him to return to his best – if, indeed, he can. 

Hindsight suggests that he was rushed back far too early by Monaco, especially when his rehabilitation period is measured against Walcott’s. 

The risk every player faces when returning from a long-term injury are the minor setbacks which are beginning to afflict Falcao. 

He is suffering from being in a Catch-22 situation. 

If his appearances are sporadic, he will take longer to rediscover form and fitness, yet if he pushes his body beyond what it is currently capable of, he will sustain new injuries. 

The 28-year-old is a popular figure within the dressing-room at United, with club staff also remarking how surprisingly humble and amenable the player is. 

Despite his status as a global superstar, Falcao’s down-to-earth personality has proved disarming, as has his determination to overcome his fitness problems. 

There is hope that, by missing the visit of Palace this weekend, Falcao will sit out Colombia’s friendly against the United States at Craven Cottage next Friday and also the trip to Ljubljana to face Slovenia four days later, in order to fine tune his fitness at United’s Aon Training Centre. 

Louis van Gaal remains convinced that Falcao will succeed at United and become a prolific goalscorer in the Premier League, but so far the gamble has yet to pay off. 

United are prepared to be patient, though, simply because they believe the rewards could be spectacular if Falcao regains the form that made him the most sought-after forward in world football prior to his injury.

2902~~~
He is a crock, in the summer we are gonna shell out millions for a 29 year old crock

2903~~~
We have previous

2904~~~
Rushed back indeed. And 4 years younger than Walcott so you can generally assume he'd need at least as long to fully heal. 

It does sound like a case of he costs too much to not be playing.

2905~~~
It's not worth keeping him if he can't stay fit. I love Falcao, but that's the harsh reality. I really hope he is back after the international break.

2906~~~
The question is whether he will ever be able to play to the level he did before. He's been one of the best strikers in Europe for years now and I'd love to see him reproduce that form for us, but................

2907~~~
So basically, who is the bastard we should blame for rushing him back too early? Monaco?

Even so, the lack of transparency from United in this case is not excusable.

2908~~~
There's no obligations to be transparent, as far as I know. And that's assuming the club hasn't been transparent

2909~~~
A 'knock' eh? A 'knock' that keeps you out for 3 weeks? I smell bullshit.

As for his recovery period, I thought the general consensus was that he <i>didn't</i> rush back?

2910~~~
I think the blame lies with our medical team who evaluated him before we signed off on the deal, and if they didn't drop the ball then whoever overruled them and signed him anyway.

A fully fit Falcao with a run of games under his belt is one of the best strikers in world football. However, there is a big question whether he can get to that stage before the end of the season with us. If not, signing him was a catastrophe because we paid nearly £20m (including fees to agents etc...) for him on loan and £265,000 a week for a player who we should really have known couldn't perform at his best during his time with us.

2911~~~
In all seriousness we are paying whatever wages, there comes a time no where we can send him back to have his treatment back at his 'parent' club. Or because we have this option to sign does that change things (obviously you would only do this if you were not planning on signing him).

If it gets to Xmas / new yr, and he's still on similar number of appearances then what? 

I want him to be a success but it all seems odd to me

2912~~~
Huh? What do you want United to tell you?

2913~~~
He needs to skip the two Colombia friendlies. Draw a line under the Arsenal game, that is when his season starts proper hopefully,

2914~~~
Did you not get the phone call? You clearly aren't a ******* then, tut tut.

2915~~~
Has he actually been ruled out for the Palace game then?

2916~~~
I would put a big part of the blame on our medical staff too considering how shit they have been for more than 6 years. Sometimes, I feel we are fecking worse than Real Madrid when it comes to injury woes. It's not even a compliment when I compare our medical staff with Madrid's; they were/are both awful with injury management.

This whole thing is a disaster so far. I would come nowhere near buying the player from Monaco unless he can really fire all cylinders.

Say bluntly that he is injured to *insert part of the body here* and that he is not expected to come back until *x amount of time*.

I'm all with KeninDC when it comes to implement a system/protocol where it becomes even more difficult for the club to hide anything or lie to the public.

2917~~~
I don''t mind it. You can put rough estimates on recovery times but why tell millions of people so and so will be back on this date, only to have to make another announcement when he has a setback. Cue the twitter/facebook crowd: "But you said..." Etc etc. Also, on a less important note, it's not very smart to go round letting your opponents know exactly who will and will not be available. Look at the thing we had with Diego Costa recently. Aguero was rumoured to be out too, turned out to be false for an example on the other side of the coin.

Would rather the club dealt with it and left us to support the ones who are on the field.

2918~~~
That won't happen, because this principal is not for anxious fans but for the league, who in the case of the NFL wanted to avoid fixed games.
And in Europe (England included) you will not see a club divulge 'bluntly' medical reports to the press, the league, the uefa or fifa maybe but not the press.

2919~~~
This is starting to get more concerning by the day. This will be his third game missed with a 'knock.'

2920~~~
Wow, the Walcott injury really does put things into perspective. Rushed back and I think the "niggles" will persist for a while.

2921~~~
Last year, we were the "jobs for the boys" club....
This season, we're the "jobs for the crocked" club....

2922~~~
Eh, did I miss it being revealed to be a calf injury? 

Also, doesn't this render the rest of the article (and everybody's paranoia) as bollocks, if it's his calf not his knee?

2923~~~
Here they say that it's a calf injury.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11212726/Will-Manchester-United-ever-see-the-best-of-Radamel-Falcao.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...ited-ever-see-the-best-of-Radamel-Falcao.html</a>

And here that it's a strong hematoma to the calf.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/topics/falcao-injury-is-strong-hematoma-to-calf-could-be-out-for-weeks-s" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/...ong-hematoma-to-calf-could-be-out-for-weeks-s</a>

2924~~~
I'm sure we won't be giving a single penny for him if he continues he's injury or scoring form so I'm not worried, however spending the apparent 300k wages for someone who isn't playing is worrying.

2925~~~
Sorry to hear he's injured,relieved we only got him on loan.

2926~~~
People need to just chill and let this play out a bit longer. Obviously we're impatient but I think the rewards will be worth it.

2927~~~
And why should United answer to your beck and call?

2928~~~
Does anyone know what injury he has and how long he is out for? Seems all a bit hush hush for my liking

2929~~~
He'll probably get fit...then get injured again pretty quickly. I truly believe his best days are probably behind him, fitness wise. It was always going to be a risk signing...hence the loan. Still..doesn't he cost the club £1 million pounds a month?..Wow

2930~~~
Its not really about answering to Kakeru's beck and call, its about being transparent with the fans so we know what's going on. I wouldn't go so far as to describe it as inexcusable but it is certainly regrettable and extremely frustrating. It wouldnt be such an issue if we werent floundering on the pitch but it adds to the uncertainty fans are already feeling because we are nowhere where we need to be in the league.

2931~~~
Are we committed to keeping him for the whole season if things done turn around? If his injury problems persist can we send him back and stop paying his wages? Im not sure of the legal situation around the loan.

2932~~~
It really is staggering how quickly opinions on here have changed on this dude.

Looking at the Depay thread people are saying they'd prefer him to Falcao and the last few pages of this thread (and stories in the press) have been mainly around how we probably shouldn't commit to a permanent deal, how we're lucky it's only a loan and stuff like that.

Compare and contrast with the beginning of the season, when the general tone was borderline hysteria. I was a lot less excited myself (because I was busy throwing a strop about Welbeck) but I would say a good 3 out of every 5 posts was along the lines of "OMFG!! We signed Falcao!! I don't believe it!!" 3/5 might be an underestimation too. Check out the first few pages of this thread, if you don't believe me...

Granted he hasn't exactly set the league on fire but even great players should be allowed a few games to settle into a new league/team. Look at Suarez or Neymar in their opening fixtures for Barca, for example. When said footballer is still his his first few months back from a big operation, that applies even more so. And we all knew about the ACL op when we signed him.

Yes, he has a new injury but footballers get injured. None of us have any idea whether this injury has anything to do with his surgery, or how serious it is. We don't even know if it's the same leg!

Football fans are extraordinarily fickle, they really are.

2933~~~
Its hardly surprising when the club isnt releasing any information about what is actually going on. All we know is he had an injury that kept him our for the best part of a year, he was apparently rushed back - certainly came back quicker than others have with similar injuries (Walcott) and when he has played he hasnt been the lethal presence we were all quite expecting. The guy is no spring chicken either. 

Yes, football fans are fickle. But no matter who you are talking about, in the absence of information you get speculation, which ends up morphing into fear and worst case scenarios. It is hardly a good mix. 

I dont think there is anything wrong with starting to think about the possibility that this whole thing is going to go south. Of course there remains a very good chance that it wont. Luckily we are all just muppets posting on the internet and what we say wont affect the outcome either way.

2934~~~
It stunk of Shevchenko's move to Chelsea at the start, his early performances have been the same as Shevchenko's and at the end of the season he'll have a goal tally similar to Shevchenko's first season at Chelsea.

2935~~~
If Welbeck was here I reckon we'd be top of the league.

2936~~~
Of course. I recon he'd be the leading goalscorer too.

2937~~~
Carlsberg dont do football strikers. But if they did, theyd probably be Danny Welbeck.

2938~~~
We knew all the stuff in bold when we signed him. Which didn't stop the wall to wall giddiness at the time.

Yes he hasn't hit the ground running in terms of his performances on the pitch but he's already created two goals, scored one, came the width of the bar away from scoring another absolute peach. In just 4 appearances for the club. With all the provisos about a new team/new league etc. that's not bad at all. He's also been lethal for Colombia, by all accounts.

He's certainly not looking like a Shevchenko style flop. I would say we've definitely looked a lot more dangerous with him on the pitch than we have without him. Which can only reflect well on his contribution.

I dunno, just seems like far too much is being read into very little information. Not trying to sneer at anyone here, just find it strange/interesting how quickly the consensus has gone from joy to despair.

2939~~~
Well, he'd at least have scored more than Falcao

2940~~~
Absolutely spot on.  Some of the reporting from so called pundits on him has been exceptionally poor.  "Oh, he's only scored one so he's clearly been shite" thinking.  Beggars belief. 

Falcao has looked very good in the 5 games he has played.  His movement is phenomenal and he will get goals for us.

2941~~~
Whether of not you think we should have made more of an effort to hold onto Welbeck has no bearing on whether or not you think Falcao will be a flop at United. That should go without saying.

2942~~~
I remember I got laughed at for saying that in PICTURES of United's training sessons, Falcao looks like he's running gingerly. Sadly, I was fecking right, as usual. This guy's career here does not look promising.

2943~~~
Not necessarily. He's scored 1 more goal than Falcao (and one less assist), playing in nearly twice as many games. In his preferred position as well.

2944~~~
Alright mate.

2945~~~
I'm not concerned with his form at all. My only concern is getting him fit. The problem is, the longer he's out the more people speculate and make things up.

2946~~~
That's <i>exactly</i> what he looks like. Shevchenko did exactly the same thing when he arrived at Chelsea, oozed class on the ball and was great off it, gets an early goal or two but it never quite comes together for them like it used to and the goals don't come at the rate everyone expects. Their confidence drops and the class on the ball starts to leave them then it all goes to shit. Sometimes you get a bit of a second wind in the following season especially if there is no international tournaments but it never ends up being more than that.

2947~~~
Id say its moderately interesting and not particularly strange, given the universal truth of your original observation: football fans are a fickle bunch. But I can only repeat what I said before really. You say far too much is being read into very little information. I say people will come up with theories about what is going on whether they have information or not. If we actually had some information then maybe people would be calmer. Like you said, it could be the other leg. If it was, and the club came out and said it, people wouldnt have to speculate. 

A vacuum of information is a very dangerous thing, especially for people as emotionally charged as football fans.

2948~~~
All that stuff in bold is just you talking about Shevchenko's career. Falcao hasn't yet done any of that, so no idea how you can say his career at United is looking exactly like Shevchenko's already.

Other than the stuff which <i>isn't</i> in bold but all of that would generally augur well for the future and applies to almost every great signing too!

2949~~~
Really? Im trying to get my head around this. Surely the belief Falcao was going to be an undroppable goal-scoring galactico for us was precisely the justification for letting Welbeck go? Conversely, if you considered him high risk, someone who may well not actually play very much, and taking into account RVP's own injury record, surely that would be a very good reason to keep a striker at the club?

2950~~~
We're on the same page, so. 

Just trying to take a step back from all the emotionally charged stuff and give a bit of perspective. Us football fans needs that sometimes!

2951~~~
I presume what you are saying is that Van Gaal let Welbeck go because he didnt rate him, and it was nothing to do with how many opportunities he would have.

He'd better hope Van Persie stays fit or that decision will look very negligent.

2952~~~
I think the worst thing for Falcao is the fact that he's only back from a massive injury AND we're having our worst luck ever with injuries so of course people are going to get frustrated even if his newest injury is not even on the same limb as his knee injury. 

I myself am not concerned about his ability, he's not your typical striker that just gets goals and needs form for it, he's actually a brilliant all rounded player and has showed glimpses of that but keeps getting injured before he can start scoring!

I'm against the signing at the end of the summer unless things change rapidly in the fitness department, we've too many crocks at the club. I still have faith however, he can truly be one of the best strikers this league has seen.

2953~~~
You know how an hypothesis works. You state your evidence and what you believe your interpretation is then you state what will happen if your analysis is correct. I'm saying Falcao's career at United will look like Shevchenko's based on what we've already seen not what I think will happen but then you already know that so it was a bit of a strange remark to make.

It doesn't apply for great signings though, when has signing a 28 year old forward that gets off to a slow start <i>ever </i>turned out being a great signing? You don't sign world class strikers at that age to be slow starters, they either pick up where they left off ala RvP or RvN at Madrid or they just never get going like Shevchenko and Henry.

2954~~~
My personal preference would have been to keep Welbeck and ditch RvP. I figured Falcao was younger and better than his Dutch counterpart, who I thought was already over the hill based on last season's peformances. I was only left a bit cold by Falcao's arrival because of a general grumpiness about Welbeck leaving and worries about us going all Van Gaalactico while overlooking homegrown talent (worries that have been eased with the likes of Wilson and McNair getting games).

2955~~~
That can't be true, can it?  He's scored a handful of goals for them hasn't he?  That was the impression I had but admit I can't be arsed to check.

2956~~~
Suarez is a year younger than Falcao and given the "interesting" circumstances around Suarez's start at Barcelona I'd be willing to give him the benefit of the doubt for now. 

If I had to stick my neck out I'd say he'd go the way of David Villa and Ibrahimovic though simply because Barcelona don't need him with Messi, not because he's had a slow start, as I think he's not a great example of what I'm talking about.

2957~~~
He will be a success at Manchester United, it's ok to start slowly with him.

2958~~~
I only considered league games. I think its only fair to do this comparison that way.

2959~~~
Ok, so you're <i>predicting</i> that his career will mirror Shevchenko's. Fair enough. You seem to be basing that they both had a decent start "<i>oozed class on the ball and was great off it, gets an early goal or two</i>" which is a strange basis to predict a future flop.

See above. I thought we're agreeing that Falcao <i>hasn't</i> got off to a slow start? He's actually been decent enough, as was Shevchenko.

In answer to your question, Luis Suarez is 27 and has had a slow start at Barca. I suspect he will still turn out to be a great signing.

2960~~~
Good stuff. An example of a player Falcao's age or older who didn't have to score a goal a game in his first few fixtures at a new club in order to end up a major success (talking about his stint at Milan and PSG, obviously).

2961~~~
<a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> You wanted to ditch RVP? After one season blighted by injuries where he regardless still managed a pretty decent haul of goals? 

You fickle football fan. 

I agree with what you were saying a couple of days ago though, Welbeck would have suited us really well in those tight games against City and Chelsea. 

Personally Id have kept them all around. Sure someone might have ended up frustrated on the bench but that isnt my primary concern.

2962~~~
If it was one in, one out (and that was the rational for getting rid of Welbeck) yes I would have ditched RvP. I would also argue that an opinion formed over an entire season (and a WC tournament in which I was really unimpressed by his overall form) isn't particularly fickle. If we could have held onto all of them, sure, I'd be ok with that. Like you, I'm not too fussed about people getting frustrated on the bench. The more competition for places the better IMO. Makes us a stronger team. Of course, I can understand why a manager might consider that an unnecesary headache.

Mind you, I think the fact we've got three superstar strikers is inherently problematic. As our manager seemed intent on trialling weird formations to give them all a game. Which does seem to endorse the idea that two superstars and two "up and comers" would have given us a better balance.

2963~~~
I'm the same. His performances seemed okay, so I am not knocking them at all. It's his fitness that is the big issue.  It'd be a huge shame if he has wrecked his career by trying to return early from the ACL injury

2964~~~
Welbeck wanted the move. Before Van Gaal turned up he was pushing for a move.

Football players are also just so fickle, they really are.

2965~~~
He's score a couple for England, I think two in the league and a hat trick in Europe.

2966~~~
Football has become  a fickle sport.

2967~~~
When did his contract run till though? Was it till the end of this season? 

Anyway, my Welbeck comment was originally intended as a joke, no point in getting into a big debate about it here.

2968~~~
You can add me to the <i>'would have let van Persie go and kept Welbeck, if possible' </i>group too.
You're then looking at a more versatile set of strikers. Three up top is very doable too. 
I appreaciate van Persie's role in number 20, but I've never been too attached to him, and believe he hindered us in ways.

Realistically it wasn't going to happen, because very few clubs who'd want/need van Persie could pay his wages, and he wasn't ever as open to moving as Welbeck,.

2969~~~
This is true. So I guess we have to accept that it's Falcao in = Welbeck out.

Hopefully the wisdom of the decision will be borne out as the season progresses. Falcao is obviously a really top class player, so fingers crossed it's onwards and upwards from here.

2970~~~
Neither of you are mentioning the sentimental aspect. Would Van Gaal have come in and axed his friend and confidant? Hard to see it. The old Dutch softy that he is.

2971~~~
It really has.

In my day once you'd formed an opinion you stuck with it for 3 score and 10.

2972~~~
Yeah, that's a big factor too. He won't even fecking drop him, so expecting him to sell him was more than a little unrealistic.

2973~~~
If we're being honest I don't think there is any manager in the world who would have done that (sold an ally at a new club like Van Persie).

2974~~~
The expected role for Falcao was not like when Michael Owen was signed-a veteran who could play in spots and be a nice addition to the squad.  Instead, as someone said above, Falcao was brought in to be an integral part of the first XI. He has been unable to to this so far, we've been told because of jet lag and a knock. 

That he will make a full recovery and get back to his pre-surgery form is, IMO not a 100% certainty. Not every athlete makes a full recovery from ACL repair. And, I am concerned, based on Ogden's reporting that Falcao didn't follow the typical rehab protocol for ACL surgery recovery. 

And, yes, I'm increasingly skeptical about his calf injury being the sole reason for his absence.  He may very well have been kicked in training, but he also could have issues with his knee.

2975~~~
And neither of you mention that we would've lost to Chelsea and wouldn't have won against West Ham if it weren't for Van Persie. Would be lovely to see the the caf and especially the Welbeck thread if that had happened. First choice #9 was always going to be RVP or Rooney for Van Gaal and rightly so, that's why Welbeck wanted to move and we signed Falcao.

Didn't Radamel play for Columbia in the last international break? I vaguely remember him either playing with a little strain and scoring, or scoring and picking up a strain afterwards, but I'm not certain if that was the case. If it was though, why the hell did we let such an expensive player who just came back for injury and hadn't settled fly around the world? And if he really played with a strain, how is that possible, insane risk taking and we're reaping the rewards now.

Maybe Van Gaal felt obliged because Falcao himself wanted to play for Columbia and because LvG was a National team coach, and maybe Falcao was 100% fit when playing for Columbia, but it still strikes me as borderline insane.

2976~~~
Scored an absolute belter of a header in the first game and had a very good goal disallowed in the second one.

I do remember something about him carrying a niggle into the second of the two fixtures, which annoyed me at the time.

2977~~~
Take it up with Pogue, I never wanted to sell RVP. I thought his attitude was a bit questionable last year but for me it is way too soon to be concluding that he is past it. I expected him to be back to his old self this year under a manager who knew him very well and would know how to get the best out of him.

2978~~~
He is class, injury prone at the moment though. Dont know why people jump on his back for being injured, it is not liek half of our squad is injured. We even dont know what it is, people assume knee injury for no reason. Just when you think it couldnt get worse, the Welbeck lovers start comparisions.

2979~~~
Rather than Welbeck leaving because Falcao came in, I suspect its more likely than Falcao came in because Welbeck wanted out. We knew we were taking a risk with a player recovering from a serious injury, hence the loan.

I think we also realised that if the worst came to the worst we had Van Persie (who I think has earned more time to rediscover his form), Rooney and Wilson as options.

2980~~~
Who is jumping on his back though? Its not his fault he's injured. 

People take everything so personally. As in, assuming it is a personal thing against Falcao. Its not.

2981~~~
There were rumours in March already that Welbeck wanted out. It is how it is and I'm confident Falcao will be brilliant for us

2982~~~
Would we have been playing with 10 men, or what?
There's a difference between him scoring the winner and us being unable to win without his presence.

2983~~~
LvG confirmed he's still injured.

2984~~~
This is fecking sickening everyone wants to remain in the infirmary forever. How many players injured now? What are they all made of? Glass?

2985~~~
I've come on here to see if Falcao had a chance to play this weekend.  After reading the last two pages I am left thinking this:  It's a bit hypocritical for Caf members to have a go at Liverpool for hailing Balotelli as they did when they bought him but turned on him when he started being Balotelli....when the caf exploded with glee when we signed Falcao only to read the comments on here now calling him out to be the next Shevchenko and how his career at United will never amount to anything.  Seems a bit RAWKish to me.  Pogue put it well when he said that football fans are fickle.  It surely does not exclude some of you lot.  For me, I expect to see good things from Falcao.  It's no good that he is injured (if he still is) but I think he will prove invaluable to us in our trek toward top 4.

2986~~~
Agreed that it's no good when he's injured. If we rush him back he's just going to keep getting injured. A fully fit Falcao is tremendous, and we should be aiming to get him fully fit before playing him.

2987~~~
Well...everything we say about Falcao is going to be speculation. It's one of two things really. He'll either recover totally and become a lethal goal machine again, or he'll end up out of the team more often than not. We'll know probably by next April! No doubting his ability....just I think being Novermber, it's ok to speculate on his fitness.

2988~~~
Ibrahimovic scored 5 in 7 in his first season at Milan and 5 in 4 in his first season at PSG? Ibra is a bad example (one I was tempted not to use but his general performances at Barca in his early few games swayed me) because he didn't actually get that bad a start at Barca anyway.

Well, given he's not had his full career here yet I would have thought it was obvious there was a predictive element. Next time I'll try and be more explicit. Please don't snip off bits off my quote, the missing bit is "<i>it never quite comes together for them like it used to and the goals don't come at the rate everyone expects.</i>"

That's important. If the magic isn't there at the start it doesn't come, and it isn't with Falcao. It wasn't with Shevchenko either, people started saying how great his holdup play was and how good his runs were because in the end he wasn't getting on the end of chances with regularity and the few he did get he wasn't converting regularly. Give it a few more matches without a goal and I can guarantee there will be comments in this thread about how tidy he looks, how good his holdup play is and how hard he works off the ball. All the stuff that's great in a striker <i>who is scoring goals </i>but really not what you want to be talking about as the primary things your 'world class' striker is bringing to the team.



No? We really aren't. You continually misrepresent my initial description of Falcao as a positive when it isn't. Like Shevchenko it's got plenty of style but no substance, and when the substance isn't there at the start it doesn't usually come.

So a prediction about someone younger without the injury who has just come off a ban for biting? Not the strongest.

2989~~~
I assumed the bit in bold was all part of your prediction, though. Rather than a summary of his handful of games so far. Hence I didn't include it. It would be crazy to draw a conclusion like that already. Bearing in mind the width of a crossbar is all that prevented him racking up 2 goals and 2 assists, in 4 games (as well as the width of a post preventing the assists from being bumped up to 3).

Have left all the rest of your post un-edited, as per your request.

EDIT: I am with you on the shades or Shevchenko here. Have a bad feeling about this deal. I just think it's too soon to talk about him as a flop, considering how's been the one consistent presence in all our best attacking football this season.

2990~~~
Is there any truth to all those reports basically saying that Falcao is not "just" on loan at Utd but he's already been bought ?

2991~~~
Falcao is earning great money at United being injured. Did LVG say how long he's out for?

2992~~~
Nothing's confirmed but I do think its a done deal already.

2993~~~
Bit of a gamble and always was. I'm happy to see such an accomplished player at United but if he can't stay fit, what's the point? The Premier league is far more physical that either the Spanish or French leagues so will he, once he's fit again, stay injury free for the extended periods we'll need him for during the winter months.

2994~~~
If that's the case, is it not another (stupid ?) risk ?

2995~~~
If he ends up crocked most of the season, Yes. Do think there would be a get out clause in that regard considering his injury before the move.

2996~~~
Don't believe that for a second. It's a loan deal until the end of the year IMO.

2997~~~
Surely we wouldn't spend £40+ million on a player that that's so injury prone and quite old. There must be a clause in the contract we've made for how many appearances he makes or something. 

I still believe he is destined for Real Madrid though.

2998~~~
Wilson is the reason welbeck moved.  I have always seen wilsons ceiling being higher than welbeck's.  He just has the raw qualities that for me welbeck does not to maks it as a guaranteed starter game in and game out.

2999~~~
It is still only a loan deal but an agreement is in place if United decide to go ahead with the purchase. Obviously if he turns out to be constantly injured it is unlikely that United will take up the purchase option

3000~~~
So van Gaal pretty much confirmed that he is injured, but also that there is no place for him in the team? At least judging by that video from press conference(was it discussed anywhere else on forum?).

3001~~~
That is a little bit surprising considering how many players of African descent, often coming from the mould of being tough bastards, are playing in Ligue 1.

3002~~~
People still crying about Welbeck? Go on twitter, Arsenal fans are sick of him already. Giroud is nearly back to full fitness and will bench him soon which is a sad indictment of any striker.

3003~~~
Should have signed the lad on a bloody pay-as-you-play loan deal.

Such a shame, you can tell the lad appreciates the support from our fans at the games and is desperate to become a cult hero here. I just can't see it happening though, I can't see him returning and then having a run right through till the end of the season. It's inevitable he'll get a "knock" and be out for weeks again.

3004~~~
I haven't seen too many top level French league games in truth, but the games I have watched haven't matched the average Premiership game for pace and robustness, if that's the right word.

3005~~~
I'd love to see him make it here as, beyond my United bias, it would be shame to see such a talent (and apparently a really nice guy) wrecked by injury at 28. But we are now into the second week of November and you start to fear this is going to be stop start for the duration of his stay here.

3006~~~
Moving into November, with 1 goal and a few assists, and it's getting a bit awkward to defend him as having had anything but an average start now.

The games I watched with him and Van Persie together didn't overly look like it was working well.
Not sure it will.

I think by pure accident we've stumbled across our most effective formation now, and that's 1 striker.

3007~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3008~~~
I don't think we can say that for sure just yet - we don't have enough to go on. And although it's not only about results, 3 games with upfront and we've got just 2 points. It's not overly convincing.

3009~~~
There is no comparison between Ligue 1 and the PL, Ligue 1 is poor quality and pretty boring in comparison plus referees do not allow anywhere near as much physical contact as in the PL

3010~~~
Why? If they'd have wanted him, they'd have had him already.

We'll have it tied up that if we want him, we need to pay the money to buy.

Most likely we'll have a good pull out.

If he plays 15 games, scores 2 goals and we still buy him for 40+ million, it'll be the most mad deal ever.

3011~~~
Merci. That's what I thought though I've rarely watched French league games. They've not televised as much, at least in the UK or the USA. But there are plenty of French players who've made the jump to the Premiership and excelled (Cantona, Ginola, Viera, Evra etc). Maybe Falcao just needs a run of games to find his feet and get used to it like Paddy did when he came here from Monaco.

3012~~~
Hatful?

The champions league hatrick at home to some chimps has probably given a false impression.

In a sh!Tload of league appearances it's 2 goals.

3013~~~
I can't ever see a time we can field 3 centre backs...so the 3-4-1-2 is out for the foreseeable!

3014~~~
Falcao only played half a season in France and personally I think his style is suited to the PL. Think he'll get over his injury problems which I believe is partly due to coming back too early - once he gets fully fit I believe he will become a massive star for us in the second part of the season

3015~~~
Well yes, but the diamond has produced some good results...

3016~~~
It's going to be a slow process.

However, we can definitely win 3 of the next 4 games, and that'll make the table look a lot better.

3017~~~
Urm, yeah, I was just responding to your comment about 1 upfront but ok.

3018~~~
And when Giroud starts again loads of them will be  slagging him off and calling for Welbeck.

3019~~~
LVG seriously bid for Vermaelaen so anything is possible.
Let me add that Vermaelaen hasn't started a game for barca as yet....he is always injured.

3020~~~
Wow, this doesn't sound good

3021~~~

3022~~~
I guess that's a yes then...

3023~~~
They'll love him again when he inevitably scores the winner against us after the international break.

3024~~~
Sell whoever injured Falcao, the cnuts

3025~~~
Falcao's injured worse than is being stated in my (very possibly wrong) opinion.

Fair play to Van Gaal for protecting him.

In all honesty Falcao's transfer is one of the oddest I can remember in 30 years of supporting United. It was such a big name, so out of the blue, in a position that shocked us all, with a loan deal on one of the biggest names in world football - which itself is odd.

I dunno, I guess over the years you develop something of a 6th sense regarding transfers that'll work out and transfers that won't. As things have progressed, I just don't see this one working out.

Hope I'm wrong, because fit and firing, Falcao's the best 9 on Earth in my opinion. But with the PL you do need to be <i>really</i> <i>properly</i> fighting fit, cuz you're gonna get knocks, and it's a fast league.

3026~~~
Very frustrating, he looks eager and you can see what he offers us, lvg right to ease him in niggly injuries can happen after a long spell out, but if it were to persist he won't last here whenthere is a massive  fee to pay to sign him

3027~~~
He's got it all to do to be worth shelling £40m + out for!!

I think everyone agrees on that.

3028~~~
Without doubt. I still have a huge chunk of hope, mind.

3029~~~
There's been talk of how marvellous our attack is.

Take Falcao out, add in a sluggish Van Persie and an up and down Rooney, and Di Maria has a colossal amount on his shoulders this season

3030~~~

3031~~~
I think there will be a few back after the international break. Some selection dilemmas it seems.

3032~~~
If you listen to LVG he also seems to suggest that even when Falcao is fully fit he will more than likely spend time on the bench. I just don't think Van Gaal fancies him as a striker. LVG as a different "philosophy" on  what a striker is.

3033~~~
I think his recent words suggested the opposite. Before he got injured he got to a point where Van Gaal was ready to start to use him as his main striker.

3034~~~
If he is fit and doesn't start against RVP then his days at OT are numbered. RVP was horrendous yesterday and disappointing to watch. Replace RVP and the team will improve.

3035~~~
Even if it's not Falcao for RvP, at least it should be Rooney to replace RvP

3036~~~
Thats a bit weird i know this lad and went to school with him, the guy who tweeted of course not Falcao.

3037~~~
That's what I got from it as well.

3038~~~
Nah I think he prefers a pure goalscorer up top. It's the ones behind that he prefers to be multifaceted.

3039~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> bout fecking time. Really want Falcao to get a run of games. He's never going to get 100% by being in the bench. I understand he needs to be eased back after a serious knee problem,  but now is the time to unleash him.

3040~~~
LOLOLOLOLOOOOOOO RADAMELLLLLLLLLL FALCAOOOOOOO!

3041~~~
So why the feck would he bring him in?

3042~~~
LVG's obsession with RVP might be Falcao's downfall here. I rate RVP as the best striker in the league when firing but he simply does not do that any more, he misses waaay to many chances and is too selfish in his overall play now, His selection is actually hurting the team. He looks like he can't be bothered and quite frankly I'd sell any player who is a passenger in the summer, even my favourite one. 

I want see Falcao get a consistent run of games as first choice striker, he is 28 and would be the natural replacement for RVP in the summer.

3043~~~
It wasn't long ago that LVG announced he was in awe of Falcao's ruthlessness. 

Unless he genuinely believes RVP's star quality can come out and be effective once again, he would be mad to ignore a fully fit Falcao (if he ever gets there). I always thought it was a bizarre transfer - but from what I've seen he looks a damn site more dangerous than the other two, but with less starts and off the back of a major injury. Don't get me wrong, he hasn't been overly impressive...but I had no idea he could actually play, I always thought he was a finisher and that was his trade.

3044~~~
I'd drop RVP too in a heart beat for Falcao, when we fix our back line we can play the diamond again with Mata as #10 and Rooney up top.. frightening if all those players were on form with Di Maria, Herrera and Blind all capable of scoring too!

3045~~~
I hope Falcao returns to full fitness ASAP, hopefully before the Arsenal game.

3046~~~
I think the structure of the deal speaks volumes. Loan move with potential £40+M deal next summer. 

We're testing the waters with him because it's obviously by no means certain the player can fully recover from his injury and return to being one of the best strikers in world football. Walcott had the same injury as him around the same time and he won't be back properly challenging for a place in the Arsenal first 11 until the new year. Falcao was rushed back in August which was ridiculous.

I believe there are also questions over his true age with Columbian birth records not being as carefully managed and more open to forgery and "smudging" than those in the western world. Unconfirmed reports put Falcao in his early to mid 30's, but that has obviously been denied by all involved and may ultimately be unprovable.

3047~~~
I find that stuff so weird. Surely it wouldn't be too hard to prove. Couldn't his family give some information? Surely they remember when he was born.

3048~~~
I think we all would but let's see about LVG

3049~~~
It was all shown to be B.S. Falcao put on his twitter his real birth certificate to disprove the rumour.

3050~~~
Any word on him?

3051~~~
<b>Monaco ALREADY looking to sell Radamel Falcao to Real Madrid after Man Utd doubts</b>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/533679/Radamel-Falcao-Monaco-sell-doubts-Manchester-United" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/533679/Radamel-Falcao-Monaco-sell-doubts-Manchester-United</a>

3052~~~
I wouldn't be overly concerned by that. He'd be 30 by that time and if injuries permit, he'll have a few decent seasons for them, but I don't see him being as good as he was at Porto and Atletico. On another note, he should score at least about 15 in the second half of the season before even being considered by us for signing him, IMO.

3053~~~
Why will Madrid but him if he can't be fit for us?

3054~~~
Hope he does get fit in time for Arsenal. Presumably he won't be taking part in any Colombia games, so he can stay at home and sort himself out.
Its been unfortunate, but not unexpected that he's been injured so much and unless he stays injury free from now til the end of the season and scores a few / plays well, then £40m is too much of a gamble.

3055~~~

3056~~~
Whats is say? At work so tweets are blocked...

3057~~~
Its a link to an article in the Guardian, the headline of which is: Falcao having to ice knee after every Man Utd training session.

3058~~~
Says that he's icing his knee after every training session, without regard to its intensity.   Also says that United players are surprised that his knee requires so much treatment. 

Not sure that icing his knee means anything. Seems like a reasonable precaution for someone who had ACL surgery, but who knows?  I fear the worst for this guy.

3059~~~
i hope we dont buy him, better to invest the money in other areas. He is a likeable guy, but his injury issues are too much especially for the price quoted.

3060~~~
Another mischievous and c***ish article from Jamie Jackson. Ice on his knee after every training session? Shock, horror! United players "shocked" at the extent of treatment required? Of course they are, I mean ice is serious stuff.

Let's just rub it in and remind the reader that poor Falcao has managed just one goal in five appearances. Starts or assists are irrelevant to his malaise.

Jackson is an oik of the lowest order. He has no connections at United. He got every transfer story wrong at Utd this summer. I read his article on Van Gaal yesterday and was reminded of what a bitter twat he is. This is just another sly dig at the club.

He mentions Falcao's salary 3 times.

3061~~~
I'm actually starting to think we need a new Striker, so will reserve judgement on him till the end of the season.
We need a replacement for one of Rooney/RVP likely the latter for next season IMO

EDIT: My reasoning btw is we need pace up top, whilst RVP doesn't have it, Rooney isn't a conventional no9/striker who is always going to be in the box/playing off the last defender.

3062~~~
I think many of us will like to see him instead of RvP if it is 1 striker formation. If RvP continues his poor form, it will be only matter of time before Falcao is given chance. The key is, will he be fit enough when the chance comes? 
After Arsenal game, we have Hull, Stoke and Southampton in a space of 10 days. I expect him to start in one of the two home games (Hull and Stoke) at least. Hopefully he will be fully fit by then.

3063~~~
Icing is just a pre-caution to reduce swelling, Perhaps it's part of his rehab?. Either way it's a sensationalist headline IMO.

3064~~~
The idea of paying the figures being mentioned for a 28 year old who has had three really serious knee injuries - and is, I would suggest, relatively likely to get another one during the course of his contract - is pretty risky.

3065~~~
Risky bordering on madness unless he demonstrates he can still perform at his peak level when fit.

3066~~~
I thought he has a calf injury? What's this about his knee?

3067~~~
At least if Moyesy was here he'd have "tried to make it difficult for him" to get a contract.

3068~~~
His right knee is what his left knee should be aspiring to.

3069~~~
I hope he proves all these negativity loving journos wrong, not only for him but for us, as if Falcao isn't a hit we are suddenly looking light on #9's with LvG not fancying Rooney in the position and RvP looking shot and turning 32 at the start of next season.

3070~~~
Why was he rushed back from this injury? Walcott got injured around the same time and now he is getting some first team football.

3071~~~
It's just another shite filler article from Jamie Jackson.

3072~~~
Because Monaco are broke after their oligarch owner was cleaned out in the divorce courts and wanted to get their most expensive and most marketable asset off their books as soon as possible.

3073~~~
Because he wanted to make the World Cup. He hasn't been called up by Colombia for the upcoming internationals so hopefully this break helps.

3074~~~
Unless he has a sensational 2nd half of the season I cant see his stay being anymore than a loan. Shame as he seems like a top bloke

3075~~~
I don't think he played before the World Cup (I seem to recall he announced it was a no go at some point). But Monaco did wheel him out not long after the WC for pre-season friendlies.

3076~~~
What's with us and crocked players.

3077~~~
the knocks and niggles he's been picking up doesn't inspire me with confidence that he can stay fit and become our main man up front. I really hope he stays fit and causes LVG some problems when it comes to picking his front men.

3078~~~
Wasnt jamie jackson the cnut who tweeted a picture of LVG with the caption "bell end"?
He is a piece of shit.

3079~~~
And why isn't he using cheese ? According to Felix Magath that was something he wanted Hangeland to try and when Hangeland ridiculed it afterwards - Magaths response was:
It takes him a few seconds to try it - and if it doesn't work, it's not like he will have lost something.

3080~~~
Yes. Daniel Taylor got a well-deserved promotion from Manchester to chief football writer but the city deserves better than this clown from what was originally a Manchester newspaper.

3081~~~

One silly speculation, which a few more fools replicated without objectivity, and now millions are believing lies. A shame for those people.

Radamel's got this, guys.

3083~~~
Whats it say? Tweets blocked at work.

3084~~~
1 tonto especula, algunos pocos más tontos sin objetividad replican, para que millones crean mentiras.Nefasto lo de esos pocos.

which my best Spanish translates to something like:

One silly speculation, which a few more fools replicated without objectivity, and now millions are believing lies. A shame for those people.

3085~~~
He'd make a great poet.

3086~~~
Glad to see him respond, it must be even more frustrating for him than us.

3087~~~
Great response by Falcao, made Jamie Jackson look like a bigger idiot than usual.

3088~~~
Well hello Nostrodamus.

3089~~~
Nice to see him putting the fears to bed. Good for his reputation and the mind of the muppets!

3090~~~
so Jackson is a fool here. Hmmmmm, tbf we all know it. 
Hopefully Falcao will be back soon and scoring. Having him this season can still prove to be key factor, especially in 2nd half of season. Still lots of matches to play and he will get his opportunities.

3091~~~
Well done Radamel. Hopefully he gets a nice break now to recover and is fit for the Arsenal game. Would be great to have him in that game as Di Maria's crosses are tailor made for him. Really want him to succeed here, and to be honest, he has probably looked better then our other strikers in his limited game time so far. Got an assist against Leicester and west ham, scored vs Everton, was really good when he got subbed on against West Brom and he kind of got the assist for blinds goal too. If he can just get fit and stay fit then I think he'd be great for us in front of Rooney. RvP just needs to be dropped though, doesn't suit our play anymore.

"Radamel's got this, guys." 

Sounds to me like he is backing himself to score a hattrick against Arsenal.

3093~~~
That man is a poet and a scholar.

I think the poster has said that, not Falcao <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/> <span style="color: #ffffff">(I hope)</span>

3095~~~
Oh yes. Damn. Disappointing, I always like footballers who talk about themselves in the third person.

3096~~~
Yes. And then tried to play innocent.

3097~~~
Shut down Twitter, nobody will top that one.

3098~~~
Jamie Jackson, didn't he say there were "no plans to take a medical or even fly to Manchester" 5 hours before he arrived?

Yes, along with saying Shaw was definitely not signing for Man Utd, and that Chelsea were favourites <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3100~~~
I think his mum might be a bit biased <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

In the western world birth records are more secure and far less corruptible. In less developed countries it is possible to get hold of an official birth certificate that says whatever you want. In Africa for example their records are a complete joke and totally unreliable.

So you can't actually prove definitively how old someone from a less developed country is, because it is possible to corrupt the records.

Which as above isn't conclusive evidence of anything. That's the unfortunately reality of signing players from non-western nations.

Not saying that Falcao is older than he claims, just that it's impossible to be 100% certain of it given that it's a birth certificate issued by Columbia that's being relied upon.

3101~~~
We will probably get him fit and scoring around april / may then he will join Real Madrid in the summer and we will get hernandez back .

3102~~~
Let's just hope it's true and Radamel isn't having knee trouble though. 

Jerry(sic) Jackson is speculating of course, he doesn't have a fecking clue but it wouldn't take Derren Brown to guess there might be an issue with the knee.

3103~~~
According to the Guardian, Falcao is icing his knee after every training session. Read into that what you will.

3104~~~
And Falcao called Jamie a fool because of the story...

3105~~~
Looks like I'm a bit behind in this thread.

3106~~~
Falcao is good I mean I'd take him over RVP any day if he was fit. The fact that he is not fit right now doesn't faze me as we have are seeing lately a lot of Wilson, and hopefully we will see even more of him. Radamel better take his time to get completely fit but it should be only a calf so hopefully he is back soon..

3107~~~
Back in training, aiming to be ready for Arse:

3112~~~
The below is a good explanation of Radamel's current situation I found in another forum, definitely worth baring in mind the next time this thread/forum bursts into hysteria...


"When training to correct imbalances you run the risk of injury to the newly activated muscles because they are doing work that they previously were not doing (shut down/misfiring). Aside from Rojo and Ander (and possibly Falcao) having injury issues that are contact related anything that is part of the muscular balance aspect will sort itself out as players get stronger. If you ignore the imbalances you will have a player functioning at a status quo or gradually deteriorating level until the imbalance contributes to a major non contact injury....like tearing your ACL when you are in open space and you plant to strike a ball or change direction.

Per all the hype in the media about Falcao.....it is pretty common to ice the knee for up to 24 months post status on an ACL reconstruction for a high demand athlete at this level, especially given the rapid return to training that he embarked upon. The people reporting the "shock" at this are talking nonsense, they clearly don't know anything about ligamentous injury/recon/repair, rehab protocol, or progression post status. There are various reasons as to why he is/might be swelling. He had major surgery that took one body part to replace another.....in the days of advanced surgical techniques, accelerated rehab, and PED's the world sees an ACL as a run of the mill bump in the road; I can assure it is anything but run of the mill. Post status you have to get your muscles balanced, achieve terminal extension (matching or very close to your contralateral side), deal with nerve damage, scar tissue, bone trauma, aches, pains, patella tracking, IT band tightness, and a host of other physical things that can set you back and cause swelling. You also have to deal with the mental aspect of trusting your knee to function again and getting over the fear of "will it tear again?" in your mind whenever you plant, pivot, or land on that leg. You worry that every ache means that your surgery was flawed and you'll never be the same. I don't care how mentally tough you are or how highly regarded the surgeon, you will doubt yourself and your reconstruction a lot more than you will believe in yourself for a long, long time.

Falcao actually had a slower return from his other ACL injury lay off because of consistent secondary issues related to muscular imbalances and frequent pulls/strains; this shouldn't be a shock to anyone that did their due diligence on him. He was most likely rushed back recently because he was hitting rehab milestones that include strength, plyometric, and endurance markers that are used to judge a "successful" reconstruction and he was motivated to say he was ok because of the World Cup. The issues with that situation are plentiful....the environment is controlled and the markers are arbitrary, especially to a top level athlete that can push their body through strength and pain barriers that most people can't handle, even more so when something like the World Cup is driving you on. I would imagine Falcao is is likely experiencing some of the standard post status issues with little injuries and swelling/aches/pains. It is major surgery and it hurts for a long time afterwards.

Unless the surgeon made a significant error in the tensioning or placement of Falco's graft, it is highly unlikely that he will have instability in the knee or malfunction that would cause a repeat injury under non-contact conditions. When you see players like Holden or Rossi blowing their knee a second time in training right upon their return it is usually down to some combination of: A) overly vertical graft placement/overly tensioned graft, B) Surgery too soon after injury (you need weeks to let the knee clam down after acute injury), C) Graft choice - Bone Patellar Bone is the gold standard, not hamstring or cadaver; quad tendon (which Falcao had on this one) has had recent success and mixes the Pros of hamstring (less site morbidity) and BPB (bone on bone healing for a graft plug), but it is less proven globally, D) Rushed rehab and return.

Only "B" occurred in Falcao's case. Immediate surgery seems to be the norm in Europe vs. America where it is usually 4-6 weeks post injury for surgery, unless you have an accompanying meniscal injury (bucket handle tear) that gives you a flexion contracture, then it is usually a 2 week wait. At this point, if his graft and knee are stable, he will most likely be ok in the long term. It is just a matter of the media laying off which will be hard because he's a high profile target and supporters/United being willing to wait for him to return to full stride. The latter might take the full season. Personally I am willing wait for that ROI."

3113~~~
A fit Falcao would tear Arsenal a new one. I'm disappointed he hasn't kicked on a bit, he adds a dynamism that would allow the creative midfielders to thrive.

3114~~~
Need to get back to 2 striker lineup with a diamond formation. Di Maria has looked a shadow of himself playing on the wings. Falcao coming back from injury will be a welcome sight.

3115~~~
Up front with Rooney with Mata behind and Herrera and Di Maria behind that again.. mouth watering! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> (If only we could defend)

3116~~~
Damn, you made me click.

3117~~~
Would love that line-up, 
PS the last part is that us or Arsenal<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

I have a man crush on Falcao.

3121~~~
Feck sakes

3122~~~
He didn’t look fully fit before this injury so after another lay off I wouldn’t expect him to be under consideration to start the game. I am a big fan of his but when you consider his age and the history of problems with his knee it seems crazy we would consider paying £40m for him at the end of the season, I would have thought it should be half that fee and even then we would be taking a big risk. I hope we don’t revert back to the diamond and two up front when he is fit because although the midfielders looked good I thought the strikers and Mata all looked average at best.

3123~~~
He actually looked fitter and sharper than RVP to me

3124~~~
Possibly but RVP didn’t look fit or sharp either so I don’t see that being much of an endorsement. At the end of the day RVP and Falcao both look shadows of the players they were 2 years ago and if they can’t get back to those sort of levels then we need to look elsewhere, they probably cost the club the best part of £500k a week and they are both in the latter stages of their career so if they don't start delivering now I don't see the point in keeping them.

3125~~~
I don't think Falcao has looked bad at all. His hold up play has been fantatic, he looks strong and relatively quick too. Good in the air, he looks a threat to me when he has played.

3126~~~
He needs to start, I'm really getting pissed off with RVP.

3127~~~

Radamel Falcao has only an outside chance of being included in Manchester United’s squad against Arsenal on Saturday week as Louis van Gaal’s frustrations over the striker’s fitness and the club’s other injury woes continue.

Jonny Evans, Phil Jones and Rafael Da Silva, the defenders, are also unlikely to return from the sidelines in time for the visit to the Emirates Stadium. Falcao has played only 18 minutes of football in the past four and a half weeks, with a calf injury adding to concerns about the ability of his body to withstand the physical rigours of playing regularly in the Barclays Premier League.

The Colombia striker ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in late January, but returned to action a little more than six months later and there are worries that he may have come back too soon.

Falcao angrily dismissed claims on Monday that he has to pack his troublesome left knee in ice after every game, but doubts have been raised about United’s willingness to turn his loan move from Monaco into a permanent £43.5 million transfer next summer. Dropped to the substitutes’ bench for the 2-2 draw away to West Bromwich Albion last month, Falcao suffered a calf injury in training before United’s next match against Chelsea and has missed their past three games.

Falcao tweeted yesterday that he was “ready to train with the best motivation”, but Van Gaal has little hope of the player being fit to face Arsenal.

Evans has not featured since injuring an ankle in September, Jones returned from a six-week layoff with a hamstring injury against West Brom only to suffer a shin problem that has kept him out since then and Rafael has missed the past two matches with a hamstring strain.

When asked if he expected any of Falcao, Evans, Jones or Rafael to be fit for Arsenal, Van Gaal said: “No, I don’t think so because now some of them have already not played for five, six, seven weeks. They could sit on the bench, because they can play 20 minutes, but I cannot put a lot of players who are not 100 per cent fit on the bench.”

Van Gaal will welcome back one defender, Chris Smalling, against Arsenal after the England player missed the Crystal Palace match through suspension, although he will hope that Angel Di María returns to form after a disappointing few weeks.

The United manager had complained about the Argentina midfielder losing the ball “a lot of times” against Palace. It preceded a claim yesterday by Carlo Ancelotti, the Real Madrid coach, that the European champions sold Di María because he could be guilty of conceding possession in dangerous areas.

“Di Maria could take matches by storm with his energy, but he also used to lose control sometimes, misplacing important passes,” he said.

3128~~~
I am not saying he has been terrible but he has only scored once and it isn’t the Falcao that was one of the top players in the world at Athletico, I know he is coming back from injury and will get better but how long that will take and how much the injury will have taken out of him is very much up in the air. Based on what he has shown so far I wouldn’t rush to hand over £40m for him.

3129~~~
How many minutes has he played? He scored once and setup 2 goals in a total of about 270 minutes or less.
I watched him for Columbia during the last INT break looked pretty sharp, scored there too. I'm not panicing about his form, I more worried that he sits on the bench vs WestBrom when he looked better than RVP

3130~~~
I thought it was probably 50/50 who should’ve started against West Brom but he hasn’t been fit since then and that combined with the fact he didn’t look completely fit or anywhere near his best before that is definitely a cause for concern. Obviously he still has time to turn it round but I wouldn’t be rushing him back into the starting 11 just yet.

3131~~~
Disappointing but fair enough I guess, but surely Falcao is the one you put on the bench out of the 4 as if you need to throw a player on with 20 minutes to go to get a goal it's him.

3132~~~
What about him didn't look fit? Was he running gingerly? Backing out of tackles? Didn't look strong? Wasn't as sharp in his movement? 
To me he looked dangerous and was doing what any player does coming back from a major injury; playing himself into form. And as has been mentioned, 2 assists and a goal in the number of minutes, combined with his hold up play meant I had no worry about his form or fitness at that point. He looked like he was where he should be. The nature of his goal, being alert and sharp with an instinctive finish, was very encouraging imo.
Also I saw nobody saying he didn't look fit after any of the games that he played in. 

Obviously his absence at the moment is a huge concern and we can only hope he is fit and firing asap, but that's all we can do right now.

3133~~~
This, I don't get why people keep saying he didn't look fit.

3134~~~
He's looked perfectly fit every time he's played for us so far, and much more dangerous than his lone goal suggests. It's just that he's never on the pitch.

Those complaining about his output, incidentally, are forgetting just how little he's played. Two assists and a goal in three starts isn't bad at all.

3135~~~
So far whenever he has started games for United, he has been substituted at around the 70 mins mark. Typically, having looked exhausted for the previous 10 mins. Leicester match started well but in the 2nd half his control seemed to desert him. Everton game, Wilson came on because our strikers weren't working hard enough to track their fullbacks when they came forward.

3136~~~
Thats match fitness and nothing to do with general fitness to do with an injury. He has to play to get match fit.

3137~~~
He is yet to play 90 mins for us and has only made 4 appearances since he joined, when he has started his has run out of steam in the second half so it is fairly safe to assume he hasn't been fully fit or has failed to convince the manager he is. When he completes 90 mins and is playing games back to back he will have proven his fitness but until then I don't think anyone can say he looks 100% fit.

3138~~~
*sigh* he has to play to get match fit. Not starting games or getting 18 mins as a sub doesn't help one bit.

3139~~~
Also when people are mentioning him not looking fit etc they are directly linking it to his knee injury.
Fact is he looks sharp and fit and quick and able to hold up the ball very well. So he can't last 90 mins yet, well yeah he isn't playing much so thats obviously going to be the case.

3140~~~
I agree he didn't look 100% fit but he was doing what any player coming back from a major injury does. Getting games and minutes to build his fitness up.

3141~~~
Can't wait to see him back playing again, if we could even get an 80% Falcao that was at Atletico, that should be enough alone to fire us into the Champions League next season.

But yeah hoping 2nd half of the season we'll all see the real Falcao.

3142~~~
I think you are just contradicting your own argument by admitting that he isn't 'match fit'. Clearly if he was playing all the time it would help his cause but he has to convince the manager he is fit to play and then take the opportunity when it arises. When he has played I don't think he has better significantly better or worse than RVP, at some point he will get a chance to put that right but he might have to wait a few games.

Fit or match fit whatever you want to call it he isn’t 100% and that’s the point I was making originally when I said he doesn’t look fit, of course his general fitness is fine he is an professional footballer who clearly looks after himself but he isn’t ready to play consistently at the required level, complete 90 mins and hasn’t been able to stay injury free.

3143~~~
I agree it is to be expected that someone recovering from a serious injury will take a while but I don’t feel we are any closer to him getting back up to speed than we were the day he signed and as with any serious injury there is also the consideration that the recovery might take a long time and the possibility he will never fully recover. I think he has an excellent player but so far even though it is still early days he is a million miles away from being that player.

3144~~~
The usual amateur dramatics from some and far too early to be writing him off

Think I'll reserve judgement until later in the season when he's had a run of games but he looked sharp enough to me when he did play.

If he doesn't get a run of games due to being perma crocked then we'll know there's a problem.

3145~~~
Is it just me or does LVG never really give anything away on injuries, most of our injuries seem like mysteries, no return date or even what injury it is with some players.

3148~~~
I recall him mentioning in a press conference (regarding Jones' injury after the England game) that he doesn't want to put pressure on the player by publicly stating a return date

3149~~~
It's after training, he is maybe faster than Pereira.

3150~~~
Tbf in early season that could have applied to a delirious snail with a limp.

3151~~~
So does my nan tbf, and she's been dead since 2009.

3152~~~
And people said he couldn't handle the pace of the English game.

3153~~~
Im just kidding around really, great to see he's training. Looks like he is making a point of proving he is training with the lads. Seems determined to ram some words down certain peoples throats. Good.

3154~~~
I think that's the first time I've seen Pereira smile.

3155~~~
Everyone would smile with Falcao sitting next to them!

3156~~~
Hiding his knee? Ice pack <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3157~~~
Just want him to settle down and score a lot for United. He seems to be very very humble. Hopefully Falcao starts and scores against Arsenal.

3158~~~
Hiding his injury with jeans I see.

3159~~~
because his real madrid kit is in the laundry.

Sounds promising. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2835375/Manchester-United-striker-Radamel-Falcao-fit-face-Arsenal-says-Colombia-boss-Jose-Pekerman.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/foo..._campaign=1490</a>

Colombia manager Jose Pekerman has revealed that Radamel Falcao is on the verge of return and claims he will go on to break records in England.
The Manchester United striker sat out Colombia's 2-1 win against the USA at Craven Cottage on Friday night.
But Pekerman believes he could be ready to for Manchester United's match against Arsenal when the Barclays Premier League returns next weekend.


Pekerman said: 'There is no doubt he is in optimal condition. He's recovered very successfully. He done everything perfectly. This is a small muscular injury, it is different to the knee injury before the World Cup.
'He's in a good condition and could be ready for Arsenal. He hasn't even started yet. He will be one of the best players Manchester United have had and will break a lot of records in England.'
In Falcao's absence, Teofilo Gutierrez headed in Edwin Cardona's cross in the 87th minute to beat America as Colombia came from a goal down.
USA took the lead in the 10th minute through Jozy Altidore's penalty, but Colombia equalised in the second half when James Rodriguez played a delicate through pass into the path of Carlos Bacca who rounded Brad Guzan and scored.

3161~~~
Regarding Falcao's knee it's not surprising he hasn't featured much so far and that the club have had him in cotton wool. Sometimes it's a 12 month injury and the player really doesn't start playing competitively before that. It's a testament to his fitness that he's back and playing so soon. 

And if he is icing his knee after every session I wouldn't be too worried by that. It's still early doors yet. If six months down the track he's still not playing regularly then that would be a problem. And by the sound of things it was just a regular ACL tear which has an excellent recovery rate these days. Nothing has happened thus far that has said to me he won't make a full recovery.

3162~~~
Be great if we could have him back for the Arsenal. Doubt he'd start, but he'd be great to bring on with about 20 minutes to go.

3163~~~
Expecting this thread to be filled with "broken skull and all the bones in his body, just from looking at a football" type of posts.

Need this guy. Lucky to see him in person when he played with Porto...Forget goalscoring, this guy can completely mess a back 4, all by himself. Purely from his movement. Incredible talent.

Just to watch someone like him play, at full tilt again would be a dream and a big advantage to United. . . He would destroy the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal by himself....The backline that is

3164~~~
Co-Sign. If we can just get him back to even 80% of the striker he was he will give us such a huge edge and I think it'll actually highlight just how far RVP has fallen. Really encouraged reason the reports that his injury is nothing to worry about. Desperate for him to get 5 or 10 90 minute games under his belt.

3165~~~
Don't think he will start.

But if he makes the bench I think he will come on after 55-60 or so.

3166~~~
On his way back to training from watching Colombia in London.

It's a pic from the train journey back to Manchester but it looks like a catalog pic for an expensive watch.

3167~~~
Beautiful man <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Seems like the rumors may have been unfounded after all, regarding his injuries.

3168~~~
If we can get this man firing we'll be unstoppable up front.

3169~~~
Errrm, you'd have to have players behind him who can create, sadly the only one in our squad who can create is Di Maria..

3170~~~
Herrera, Mata and Rooney.

3171~~~
Yep forgetting Rooney who is always near the top of the assist league every year.........

3172~~~
Wouldnt call Rooney and Mata creative, they've really shown that for a long period, good goalscorers and smart player, but cant even remember the last time they put someone 1 vs 1 by a simple through ball. They are very productive no 10's but not not half as creative as lets say Hazard, Ozil, Silva.

3173~~~
How many of them come from corners and free kicks? I watched Rooney's assists last year, and the majority arent really the no #10 kind of assists, those through balls or smart passes.

3174~~~
I absolutely agree about that (apart from the Arsenal version of Özil but that's another matter) but they are definitely capable of creating.

3175~~~
Ozil has been poor, but yet he is creating more chances than Rooney and Mata, stats prove that.

3176~~~
Fair enough.

3177~~~
Why does the type of assist matter once your striker is getting on the end of them and scoring? Goals are goals and Mata, Rooney, Herrera & Di Maria are all able to create.

3178~~~
He seems like the sort of player who needs to be 100% fit before he's happy to play. As opposed to a player like Richard Dunne who'll play if he can hobble over the white line.

3179~~~
Because a good corner doesnt make you a creative player? I'm talking about creative players in terms of general play, that's not quite what Rooney offers. You just remember the last time Rooney has created a decent chance for the striker to score, I think the last time was vs Roma. Di Maria is very able, Herrera mwaah, he isnt the assist king or key passes king or something in that region. He also played behind the striker at Bilbao, now being played deeper will obviously not really help his creativity.

3180~~~
Still excited about Falcao. I think he will be excellent for us up top on his own (if he ever gets the chance).

3181~~~
Still doesn't make a difference, this debate started with you arguing my point of being unstoppable up top when Falcao gets firing, like 2013 we didn't have any of these ''key pass king'' you're talking about yet RVP scored 26 goals.

3182~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3183~~~
One name, Carrick. And I wouldnt compare the former RVP with Falcao, RVP was a striker who didnt depend on his teammates at all, he can create his own chances and could score out of nothing, Falcao is more the striker who anticipates from through balls and smashes in every header.

3184~~~
?

3185~~~
The last time Rooney created a good chance for a striker was vs Roma in 2007?! 
And the whole "assist king/key pass king" is silly. Herrera played the most through balls in La Liga last season after Fabregas (if I'm not mistaken). He's clearly creative and has shown it for us too. We have plenty of players who can create, Rooney and Mata as well even though you seem to want to dismiss them. Both of them always get a lot of assists and whether it's from set-pieces sometimes or not it's still creating a chance for a team mate. LvG is trying to search for a balance and in doing so he has reduced our creativity somewhat but we were creating plenty before we switched formation.

3186~~~
If he's every fully fit is my main worry man..

3187~~~
Last chance Rooney created was in 07? Without even thinking I can remember his through ball to Welbeck at Villa Park last year and his pass to ADM at Leciester this season. Even ADM creates a lot of chances but then they fall to RvP who misses them with supreme consistency.

3188~~~
Perfect balance for me in CM, is to get 2 tough box to box CM's in, that can get stuck in & create/pass also. Herrera & Blind are not the answer to our problems in CM. They're massive upgrades on Cleverly though..

3189~~~
No I'm talking about this summers Roma game, he gave some brilliant passes. About Herrera, his assists rate was 0,18, and he created under 2 chances per match, that isnt too creative. Those numbers come from last season, when he played behind the striker, being played deeper wont benefit his creativity will it? Rooney and Mata, they can create, but they arent the creative type of attacking, they are very different from the likes of Silva, Ozil, Reus, Kroos, Hazard, Ribery, those players named above, they create more chances, have more key passes while Rooney and Mata score more than them. I'm talking about creativity in terms of open play, so I leave the corner/free kick assists out of this, as a defender could also give those, that's more about you kick/curve than creativity.

3190~~~
You do know we played Roma this summer.

3191~~~
Suggesting that the likes of Rooney, Mata and Herrera aren't creative players is just daft. They're not David Silva, and can't dictate a game as such, but they're very creative players nonetheless.

3192~~~
Them 3 have created 23 chances this season, and 22 key passes. Reus alone has 16 key passes and has created 18 this season..Silva has created 20 chances and 22 key passes, Gotze 18 chances and 17 key passes, Hazard 20 chances and 21 key passes, Fabregas has created 32 chances and 23 key passes, they arent non creative players, but if I compare them to really creative players, they just lack something very much.

3193~~~
"This season" being the operative phrase. Herrera has played deeper than all of them aside from Fabregas, the latter, incidentally, probably delivers the best through ball the Premier League has ever seen, so I'll let Ander off just a tad. Mata and Rooney have proven their creative worth time and time again for years now. The better we play the more these guys will create.

3194~~~
Have they played the same amount of games ?

3195~~~
No, but them three have played far more games than all the other ones named in their own.

3196~~~
Just what I said, him playing deeper will not benefit him in terms of his creativity. Rooney statistically, hasnt been one of the most creative players, Mata was back in 2012/2013, but since then, he hasnt been creating an awful lot, as I have stated earlier. I just cant remember and dont see Mata/Roo creating a lot of chances for a while now, also not a lot of clear cut chances. So them sending a striker 1 vs 1 or something like that, or just a simple through ball, even Januzaj has done that more than them recently. I may look like a stat whore, but last season Rooney was as creative as fecking Stevie Me. He is a whole different kind of number 10, he has one of the best work rates in world football, he has dynamism, is very complete, has speed, is strong has a brilliant right foot and can score, but he isnt the one creating that chance or making that smart move in which he creates space for his team mate.

3197~~~
But if they had the opportunity to all play regularly, they numbers would have inflated, the length of your string of games and the quality of your teammates change a lot of things for creative players.

3198~~~
Wayne has for example, but also before his red card, he wasnt creating much, playing alongside Falcao, Herrera, RVP, di Maria, not the least of players. Reus for example, he has done all this just coming back from injury in I side who werent performing and I doubt that the current Dortmund team has better players than United, so I dont think its an excuse. If I compare Rooney to other players who are playing in current poor sides like Firmino, Cazorla, they still create more. Mata has played like every match last season since his arrival, although he was in a not performing side, he still wasnt creating. But when Mata played in Chelsea 2012/2013 where the only other top class player was Hazard, he was near Silva, I dont think that's the crucial factor. TBF, its also not all their fault, under LVG and Moyes I think we play one of the slowest kind of football nowadays, teams just sit back and we cant cause any harm. But even when we were playing faster football, vs QPR, we had just 2 shots inside the box and we had 9 shots on target, we havent been creating much here at United.

3199~~~
Is this the falcao thread or "key passes and assist thread "

3200~~~
I come into this thread full of hope, now I feel confused.

3201~~~
Sammyjunn broke it by going full retard. What is it they say about going full retard?

3202~~~
Full retard you say, backed my argument up with facts and stats, Rooney/Mata arent the most creative players around, dont understand how you can argue that if you watch every United match.

3203~~~
They say "never go full retard". Quit while you're ahead Sunny Jim, this is the Falcao thread.

3204~~~
Regardless, we still have creative players in Rooney, Di Maria, Mata and Herrera. Sammyjunn was trying to claim they're not creative apart from Di Maria.

3205~~~
I also find it strange how Mata was the dream number ten for a lot of people on here whilst he was at Chelsea, people were creaming over his 35 assists in 2012/13 (or however many it was), then he comes to us and he's reduced to 'just a goalscorer'. He's creative too. We might not be seeing the best of him atm for whatever reason, but he is a creative  player.

3206~~~
Mata was in terms of creativity near Silva at that time, but he was one of the most productive players in the world with over 50 goals+assists in one season, but since Mourinho's arrival at Chelsea it all faded away. Now at United, the thing he really adds is his goals, he has an increadible knack for goals and there was a moment where he had like 8 goals in his last 9/10 matches, but he hasnt been really creating lots of chances for us yet.  He has 6 assists since the 1st of January, very underwhelming in that aspect.

3207~~~
Falcao needs to start if he is fit. Both him and RvP can pull defenders away allowing players like Di Maria, Rooney and Herrera to get into the box and score goals. Team has not looked good enough going forward the last few games playing 1 striker.

3208~~~
Personally, I'm in the "power, pace and athleticism" camp when it comes to my favourite players, so a technical, slow, non athletic player sich as Mata, however good he is, always slightly worried me.
I can't see him being a regular. Rooney will always be ahead of him.

3209~~~
I'm surprised your excitement hasn't burnt away yet...we're in mid November!

Can't see him ever being a solo front man, VP is too important to Van Gaal, and I'm getting a severe sinking feeling over his fitness.

I can see him being one of those players that technically has got over his severe injury, but then instead as his body compensates, constantly picks up 2-3weekers.

3210~~~
I was initially thinking this but recent reports have me more positive. The fact it's still only been 10 months since the injury and there is still a rehabilitation procedure in place is a positive for me as it means he's still going to get stronger. Also the most recent injury is an impact injury, a bruise on his calf, not a strain from compensating.

3211~~~
Sorry, but it looks like 2 strikers may be a thing of the past. I will leave it to Van Gaal to explain why:

“It’s too much, I think, I agree. But I’m looking for the balance and when you see the last four matches we have had more balance because we haven’t conceded many goals. Nevertheless, we don’t score so much. With the other system we scored a lot of goals.”


“I have to decide which striker. It’s not his fault with the other system I could play with two strikers, but then the balance wasn’t good. We had difficulties in the last half an hour of games. That’s why I have remodelled the structure. Since then we have less goals in our favour but also less goal conceded. We have also played against the better teams in the Premier League in that time on an equal level, more or less.”

3212~~~
The grass is always greener on the other side on here. It's why a lot of rival players are ridiculously highly rated on here (some see Hazard as a top ten in the world, for example). It's easier to focus on the pros and forget about the cons when you barely watch a player and mainly see them through highlights and stats.

3213~~~
I'm quite the optimist. I still haven't given up hope on our defenders either.

I don't think we can write him off because it's November. I thought the signs pre calf injury were promising. He looked strong and was getting sharper and sharper. He was getting into good positions to get shots off (even if the shots were a bit wayward), and his hold up play and movement in the box were really good. I think he will be quality for us and I think I said before that even if we just get him fit and in his best form for the Christmas run in going forward it'll be worth it during a crucial part of the season.

3214~~~
Yeah I agree.

3215~~~
The numpty wears his watch on his right hand.

3216~~~
Aside from it being unconventional, is there written law that watches need to be worn only on the left hand? 

Wait a minute... I think I spot a high horse.

3217~~~
I wear a watch on my right hand, feels weird on my left, its quite a heavy watch though

3218~~~
I wear my watch on my right hand....feels weird on my left hand...its cringe.

3219~~~
The unwritten rule of watches is that you wear them on your non-dominant hand.

3220~~~
are there any written rules?

3221~~~
It's OK as long as he's left-handed.

3222~~~
there are no written or unwritten rules. You can wear your watch wherever you feel comfortable to wear it.

3223~~~
I wear mine on my right hand and I'm right handed. The right hand is usually the hand I'm doing something with (holding a pen, knife, typing, holding a key, pushing a door open ect ect) so it's easier to glance at it seeing as it's already out rather than raising my completely useless left hand.

3224~~~
How do you know that he doesn't pleasure himself with left hand?

3225~~~
Rooney just can't win with some folk imo.

3226~~~
Equally tho, if you're ever in combat your right hand will be busy, if you need to glance at your watch you could leave yourself exposed.

3227~~~
I'm never in combat long enough to worry about that. I generally start with a finishing move and then glance at the time on my iPhone while I'm calling them and ambulance.

3228~~~
Why do we always descend into discussions about   watch  hand correctness and footballers chest and thigh sizes during international breaks.

3229~~~
You wear on your left hand so the pin on your watch doesn't press into your hand when you lean your hand on something. 

I wear my watch on my right hand as I'm an anarchist.

3230~~~
I don't even wear a watch.

3231~~~
I'm left handed and wear my watch on my left wrist. We've got all bases covered in this thread.

What if you're ambidextrous? 

Must I resort to the old Flavor Flav style of wearing clocks hanging from my neck?

3234~~~
Hope he gets over his injury worries and we purchase him.

Just such a likeable guy, even all the coaches and players etc ay despite his status and earnings he's such a humble nice guy.

Seems like the sorta guy that would stop whatever he's doing to say hi and have a chat to you.

Article about Falcao's fitness here.

Basically says that Falcao's current injury woes has nothing to do with his knee problems. It's a number of reasons such as:

1) Worked himself to the ground to get fit for the WC which wasn't successful
2) Didn't had a proper pre-season at Monaco and was lack of match fitness due to him being injured before that
3) Was immediately thrust into action at United
4) Then got a calf injury here.

He's undergoing an intensive fitness session during this international break. It's also written that if United doesn't take up on their offer to make this deal permanent, it won't be because of his knee.

3237~~~
At least <i>our</i> new big-name striker is able to tell time.

3238~~~
Exactly. He makes lots of assists, but they're not "number 10 kind of assists" so they don't count and he's not creative.

3239~~~
I actually don't think there is anything wrong with his knee and the 2 small injuries/breaks he had it must be infuriating that people start running their mouths about something they haven't a clue about, especially now that he's in England of all places. Hope he comes back hungry with a point to prove. We have barely seen any of Falcao but he's already up there with the other club favorites for me, such a nice guy who actually wants to be here. 

Scores the winner in the 2016 UCL final against Madrid and those the Adebayor celebration all the way down to President Perez.  <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I desperately want him to be ready for Arsenal

3242~~~
Good and sensible read.

3243~~~
still hurting you got Balotelli and could not even afford Falcao's boots?

3246~~~
agree with this. Not taking style tips off the likes of Barney!

3247~~~
Google and the rest of the world agrees with me! It goes on your non-dominant hand!

3248~~~
there's a few people on this thread alone who disagree. So perhaps not the whole of the world eh

3249~~~
Any update on his injury? Will he be fit for the Arsenal game?

3250~~~
Mark Ogden said he could be in the squad. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://fw.to/yRoaH0N" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://fw.to/yRoaH0N</a>

3251~~~
Excellent. Think he could really be the difference to our season.

3252~~~
Brilliant, seems like he's nearly ready! This is where his season starts I feel (and hope)

3253~~~
Shweeet

3254~~~
Hope he's involved on Saturday. He has game-winner written all over him.

3255~~~
Not that it matters, you bunch of absolute loons, but every photo of Falcao on Google (when he's not wearing his kit) shows him wearing his watch on his left hand. And every photo of him signing something shows he's right-handed. That photo was either reversed or is atypical and maybe he's messing with people who think wearing a watch on the wrong hand makes you a "numpty." <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

3256~~~
Glad we're talking about important issues like whether Falcao wears the watch on the right hand or not rather than talking about other issues like his injury etc.

3257~~~
He's probably unbalanced by his dodgy knee so wears a big heavy watch on the opposite wrist to compensate. Bad sign IMO.

3258~~~
Bet there's a fecking ice pack under it. Only reason he could be wearing such a big watch. He's still crocked and we've been had.

3259~~~
Maybe he has really bad eyesight and needs a massive watch in order to see it properly. Which could be a big problem for us, unless he wears contacts when he is playing? Makes you wonder why he doesnt wear them at other times.

3260~~~
Hope he plays against Arsenal. Hope he starts too. We seem to have reverted to a bit of a crossing game recently, which I have no problem with if it suits the strikers. RvP isn't really suited to an aerial game, and is much better when the ball is fed to feet. Falcao, however, is a hugely powerful player in the air, and his movement in the box is unstoppable. He could really cause some problems. Di Maria's crosses have been superb for the most part, but we've got no one getting on the end of them.

3261~~~
I doubt he'll start, but I do hope it's more than the 'last twenty minutes of a petered out game with very little service as everyone is knackered' fixture for him to get on.

3262~~~
2 pages about where Falcao wears his watch? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3263~~~
I think he'll play for 20 minutes (maximum) as a sub...if we are lucky.
If he starts, bearing in mind that he is still recovering from a career threatening knee injury and now has a calf injury, LvG will be taking a huge risk.

We shouldnt worry too much about our attack. We already have Rooney, Mata and RvP who are not injury prone, so Falcao can take his time. 
It'll be a shame if Falcao doesnt recover from his injuries as it could effectively mean the end of his career at the very highest level. I wish him the best.

3264~~~
All these people debating at him wearing his watch on his right arm...... 

Who says the image isn't mirrored?

<span style="color: #ffffff">Even if it's not WHO CARES??????</span>

3265~~~
Dying to find out about his erratic 'wearing watch' habits. Think I'll tweet him.

3266~~~
You reckon?!

3267~~~
Not back in training until next week according to today's presser.

Feck knows when he'll be ready to start a game. Another week after that? Maybe two weeks later?

3268~~~
Louie said he'll need two weeks of training under his belt before being available.

3269~~~
Gah. 

This fecking season...

3270~~~
Have zero confidence he'll be back in two weeks. Wouldn't be surprised If he picks up another "knock" that delays his return even further.

3271~~~
Nearing Christmas now, and I'd have to say Falcao's been a major disappointment. I was happy we'd signed him, but perhaps not overly excited as we already possessed talent in his position, but we'd have to say, right now, he'll be heading back to Monaco at the end of the season.

3272~~~
Sadly this is pretty much exactly how I thought it would go. Never ever saw him being a success here. Still time to prove me wrong mind, but he's got a lot of catching up to do.

3273~~~
Don't think he should be written off yet. Can still turn things round.

<b>If</b> he doesn't, though, the fact we fecked Welbeck off to accomodate him will look like a truly terrible decision.

3274~~~
Brilliant player but seems like an other £20m flushed. Makes the Welbeck decision worse too.

3275~~~
He can’t afford any more spells out injured after this now because he is starting to run out of time to impress, even when he is fit it enough to be available it’s going to take a while to get him back to his best, justifying a £40m between now and the end of his loan won’t be easy for him.

3276~~~
Yeah, this has been annoyingly predictable so far. Nice guy, though, so I feel for him a little.

3277~~~
Of course we can't write him off just yet, the fact remains he's a world class centre-forward, but he's yet to get going for us and it's nearly December. It's been a very poor return of games if you consider the wages he's been on...

3278~~~
Shit happens though. He came in, played a few games, got injured. He's not even been out outrageously long just yet.

I can't help feeling negative about this deal too but footballers do get injured, so we shouldn't read too much into what's happened.

3279~~~
Suppose you're right, but as pointed out above, he's running out of time in which he can justify a big fee next summer. He'll need to hit the ground running pretty soon.

3280~~~
This is what LVG said.
Falcao will be in the squad most probably.

3281~~~
Interview with him now. Reiterated that his current injury is unrelated to his knee op.

3282~~~
No, he won't be. He's not even back in training yet.

3283~~~
Good news.

3284~~~
"My philosophy..." <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3285~~~
Wasn't he back in training last week? Anyway here is another quote


Edit -

3286~~~
Welbeck who has only scored once more in the league despite starting almost every game. Yeah, truly awful decision.

3287~~~
I'm still retaining some hope that he'll come back and start smashing them in. Cant see much chance of us forking out 40 odd million for him though.

3288~~~
Screw the philosophy at this point, if they are not hurt, play them because they'll probably otherwise do a Sturridge and keep injuring themselves in those 2 weeks first training with the selection - especially Jones and Evans.

3289~~~
Being available is also very important, what's the point of having someone who cant stay fit (this also goes for Smalling/Jones/Evans).

3290~~~
Obviously, but how anyone can say selling Welbeck was an awful decision, when his goal tally this season is not great, is ridiculous. I reckon if Falcao played half the games of Welbeck he'd still score more.

3291~~~
Welbeck was a goner regardless. He knew Wilson was breathing down his neck and got out.

3292~~~

3293~~~
Yes, pictures with Peirera iirc.

Also I'm pretty sure that quote means its a 'new injury' i.e. its not the knee injury people have been speculating about.

3294~~~
LVG is notoriously cautious with returning players from injury. I wouldn't expect to see Radamel play for a while yet.

3295~~~
I can't say I'm overly fussed to be honest. Us signing him on loan was strange enough as it is. Having a player that we didn't really need being out is not a huge concern.

3296~~~
It still is, imo, we have strengthened Arsenal and for the short term, I think Welbeck would've done better than Falcao has so far.

3297~~~
It's the calf.

3298~~~
I think most people who were unhappy assumed we might regret selling Welbeck in the long term but Falcao would be a far superior player this season.

The fact Welbeck's actually scored more league goals than Falcao, has a decent record in Europe, is avoiding injury and generally showing the qualities we're lacking most up front so far this season (work-rate, pace) is making it look like a bad decision even sooner than Welbeck's staunchest advocates thought it would.

I just hope this weekend doesn't make things even worse...

3299~~~
He needs to come back. The longer he's out, the longer RvP has no competition to his spot and continues to stroll through games. I'd love to see Rooney Falcao vs Hull next weekend

3300~~~
Moreover, we're already accommodating Rooney in midfield. I'm pretty sure Welbeck wouldn't be playing much at all.

3301~~~
Living and working in DC makes me naturally suspicious.  That Falcao's "calf injury" followed on soon after playing in three games (two internationals) and long plane flights makes me think that he aggravated his knee.   He may well have a calf knock, but that could be a secondary concern. And, all of the denials that his absence results from a knee issue seems a little too defensive, IMO.

3302~~~
This is what I was worried about when we signed him

3303~~~
Welbeck being here would have only hampered Wilson IMO, and Wilson offers similar pace, though is obviously just a youngster. Long term I still think selling him was the right move, welbeck wanted first team football but he was never going to get that here. Not like he would've played much over Rvp anyways, just wouldve replaced Wilson on the bench.

Basically, this season I don't think he would've changed anything even if he stayed, as he just wouldn't be playing. He'd be available unlike Falcao, sure, but our other strikers haven't picked up any knocks so that doesn't matter really.

The only thing this welbeck deal did was give him playing time he wouldn't have otherwise had, and give arsenal a better option up front, but even so, its not somebody will lead them to the top 4 or greatly improve them or whatever. That's Sanchez, welbeck will probably be rotated once giroud is back.

3304~~~
Really disappointed we have not seen more of him. Can't remember a time like this for injuries.

3305~~~
I think they're two separate things. The decision to replace Welbeck with Falcao has clearly been a bad one so far because Falcao has barely had a kick, but that doesn't necessarily mean that letting Welbeck go was a bad decision.

If anything, I think Welbeck's disappointed. I thought when he was here he was very close to being the finished article, being stifled by a lack of opportunity and would fairly immediately start scoring more regularly and putting in big performances, he seems to have disproved that, and seems on his way to proving people right who thought he didn't have it in him to go on to the next level. Even the media seem to have given up on their ridiculous Welbeck hype train and any talk of the 'new Henry' and 'a bargain at £16m' seems to have died down.

3306~~~
Feck all good its done for us so far.

3307~~~
There's less hype and he's going through a quiet spell in front of goal. Arsenal have been terrible over the last few weeks though so he's not exactly been inundated with chances. Did very well for England and looked good for Arsenal in every game I've watched. Certainly looking much more effective than any number 9 Van Gaal has picked for United so far this season.

Anyhoo. I'm boring everyone to death with my Welbeck whinging.

Back to Radamel Falcao....

3308~~~
Perhaps its more a case of my expectations of what Welbeck was going to become being more closely realigned with reality and nothing more than that. But I just feel like he's doing simply what a lot always suspected of him: working hard, linking play nicely, not being prolific, I take your point about Arsenal and us, but still feel like its a little exaggerated. The talk is Giroud will be straight back in the Arsenal side Saturday, which is far from a glowing endorsement of what Welbeck's brought to that side.

I just think, when the alternative was keeping Welbeck and Falcao going to City (and inevitably playing every game and banging in 10 goals already because thats how these things work out) I'm not sure we're worse off in either the short term or the long term.

3309~~~
Have noticed that during his time here, also he's very picky with fitness levels.

3310~~~
Hoping we have not agreed to buy him on a permanent deal yet.

3311~~~
Just ughh.

3312~~~
Would rather be patient and wait for him to get up to full speed then see him playing whilst not at 100% and risking picking up these niggling injuries.

3313~~~
It's obvious that Van Gaal has his entirely own criteria of 'match fit'. These players may be fitter than your average player, but in order to be in a Van Gaal starting XI, you have to be in the utmost levels of fitness. Something Falcao is clearly not in due to his circumstances, so it may be a while until he is ready for Van Gaal. 

Which is something I don't necessarily mind, seeing as how we have RVP and Rooney to play up top for us, resulting in us not necessarily <i>needing</i> Falcao. I would rather we wait on him and let him get a sustained run rather than this start-stop season he seems to be having. 

I get that some fans are getting impatient, but this is not a minor surgery he is recovering from, it can affect various muscle groups if not careful during recovery.

3314~~~
Couldn't even consider buying him at the moment.

3315~~~
A new injury he suffered a few weeks ago. Wut?

3316~~~
So essentially, he most likely won't be getting a run of games until the new year? Don't expect to see him here next summer. I expect a very disappointing end to this, and then he'll end up elsewhere and be an absolute beast. It's inevitable

3317~~~
Is he ever going to be fit?
This is just my own opinion , we wont see him in a United shirt next season.

3318~~~
Starting to fear the worst with him now, what has he played this season? 200 minutes at most?

3319~~~
There were reports that we have already shaken hands on a deal?

3320~~~
Talksport (I know) just said another 2 weeks?

3321~~~
Judging by the look Stuart shot to Paddy on MUTV when a caller said that he won't be here next year, I'd guess you are right.

3322~~~
There's an underground car park in Manchester. I'm on my way there now to get the latest from my source Deep Goat, who has never shown his face but speaks with a poorly disguised Scottish accent. If I survive, we'll know more.

3323~~~
Let me know if he tells you to follow the money.

3324~~~
Ah, the old 'he denied this, which makes me even <i>more</i> sure it's true!' approach to logic.

3325~~~
Jim Hacker, (fictional) British PM: "First rule in politics: never believe anything until it's officially denied."

3326~~~
Also known as the win-win-win logic,if you say nothing you are hiding something, if you deny calmly then you don't seem sure of yourself and if you deny fiercely, you are clearly lying.

3327~~~
Exactly.

3328~~~
Very disappointing news. I still hold hopes for him that he'll deliver, but at the current rate, he's not going to be in a United shirt next season. I'd be surprised if we go all out and buy him if he doesn't have a good season.

3329~~~
A new injury while still injured ? I really hope all these rumors about him being already bought for next year are lies, what a weird loan signing it's been. Very very underwhelming so far.

3330~~~
Tell you what, I'll take 6 weeks as an over before we see Falcao play 90 minutes. Until I see that I don't believe anything I hear.

3331~~~
He's going to need to have an absolutely extraordinary second half of the season for us to even consider buying him. Can't see that happen. He'll be gone at the end of the season.

3332~~~
Thank feck we did a loan.

3333~~~
When something seems too good to be true, it usually is. He's crocked.

3334~~~
If i'm being honest, i absolutely do not care about Falcao, i want us to play with 1 striker and i want it to be Rooney with Wilson as cover.

3335~~~
"To clarify, "new injury" refers to Falcao's recent calf problem. The word "new" was used to distinguish this from a previous knee injury."

3336~~~
Manchester United communication department needs some firing.

3337~~~
I thought so.

3338~~~
I doubt I'm alone in not buying a bar of this nonsense?

3339~~~
Gutted. I really can't wait for him to kickstart his season.

3340~~~
Told you so, was very obvious from the context of the quotes thats what was meant.

3341~~~
This time next year, Rodders....

3342~~~
More lies from the club. Or so people think...

3343~~~
Definitely need to improve, it's been shambolic today and too confusing.

3344~~~
Why am i not surprised.

3345~~~
Why though? The first quote is what LvG said, and it was obvious what it meant.

3346~~~
He's already a millionaire on those wages. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3347~~~
And incase that wasn't enough...



"Louis van Gaal confirms Falcao will return to full training with the first team on Sunday."

3348~~~
I know let's take him for 12 months , pay his wages , help get him back to full fitness , not see him play , then see him sign for someone else . 

You couldn't make it up could you ! 
A 6 week calf strain ffs

3349~~~
What do you mean? Conspiracy theory?! 

This is like a less extreme version of Sturridge's problems. Not a particularly far fetched story.

3350~~~
fecking interns man.

3351~~~
Afterwards he will form a duo with Aguero and lead them to the title.

3352~~~
So, basically he hasn't had a new injury, he'll return to training on the Sunday which is actually good news? But some caftards went crazy anyway.

3353~~~
Is he eating the right foods? I worry his diet is to blame.

3354~~~
It's not the caftards fault if someone and LVG don't know the definition of "new".

3355~~~
You can see moyes dressed up as a witch doctor in his spanish villa , pushing pins into Man Utd 2014/15 squad dolls , and where the pin is inserted that part of the body explodes. 
Rojo got a pin in the shoulder , blind in the knee , jones in the shin and de gea got one pushed into his finger . 
The phone must have rang and moyes got up to answer it and stood on evans by accident .

3356~~~
Typical.

3357~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3358~~~
I bet Blatter's involved in all this.

3359~~~
Manchester United, getting someone to full fitness?

He should be happy if he can still play football when we're done with him.

3360~~~
Seriously? I was looking forward to him coming on against Arsenal as well. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3361~~~
Nevermind that, how's his watch getting on?

3362~~~
The "new" injury was apparently one that happened four weeks ago. Odd use of the word, but glad Falcao will start training again.

3363~~~
those who were getting extraordinarily excited when he signed are probably feeling a little silly right now.

Call it early December bus his next appearance and a couple of assists and one goal, for what is probably £4m in wages is a right stinger.
I'm not pleased that the 12mins or so that my £1406 2 season tickets covered has been wasted!

3364~~~
Shambolic communication.

3365~~~
feck this season and its injuries.

3366~~~
I was excited to see him play. How was I supposed to know that'd never happen?

We lack a leader type striker, though. Rooney is played deeper, Wilson is too young, RvP is past it and beyond and with Falcao showing signs that he will play 2 and miss 10, perhaps we should be looking at some forwards in January?

Just a thought. As the season goes by, we might start getting more and more toothless.

3367~~~
Simpler solution would be move Rooney up top and play any of Herrera, Mata, Fellaini or Januzaj behind him and we may not be so toothless. We don't need another striker in January that's for certain - just LVG showing some balls in the one area he hasn't already, which is to drop RVP as a starter.

3368~~~
The Same club whos paying Nanis wages while on loan, our transfer department truly is abhorrently bad.Monaco really did good business with Falcao

3369~~~
Bit of a shame as it would have been nice to see more of him ( even if I dont really want him to do that well!), and want you to take something off Arsenal on Saturday.

Although the way I was called jealous for  suggesting Falcao may struggle to be fit and not the  same player he was is a far cry from the United fans now who are probably more critical of it than I was!


The religion or Hannibal or someone?

3370~~~
Im still positive about him this season. Can see 15-20 goals.

3371~~~
We're paying Nani's wages as part of the Rojo deal. We paid £6m and picked up Falcao's wages as a 12 month trial, one that if he finally gets fit could be the fecking jackpot.

3372~~~
The amount of kneejerking and crying in this thread. Wov.

3373~~~
Bring Chicha back in Jan?

3374~~~
I'd rather just play Rooney as a number 9.

3375~~~
I really don't want to be negative because I think the guy is a world class striker. But maybe he was a mistake after all. Will he ever be fit or able to play at the level he was once at again? It's not looking likely right now.

3376~~~
Except that no one ever had the courage to do so, not even Fergie. <_<

3377~~~
Fergie did it once and Rooney had his best season, in my opinion.

3378~~~
He should have stayed there then. Why would it be so hard to make it something permanent?

3379~~~
I think that was the plan, hence why we bought Kagawa to play behind him. But Van Persie became available for a steal so we wedged him in.

3380~~~
One of the guests on 'Football Today' mentioned that we have an obligation to buy him next summer. The deal was structured as such only because of FFP considerations. 

I hope that is not true, or he better get fit and start bangin' in some goals.

3381~~~
Bring back Michael Owen? Larsson?

3382~~~
Is Falcao our Sturridge?

3383~~~
Heard this too from the french media <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> I hope it's just rumors otherwise that was an incredibly risky and highly expensive decision from LVG.

3384~~~
I would amazed if the transfer is all done and dusted,  a fee has been agreed but I think we still have the option to pull out of the deal if we aren’t happy with how he gets on during the loan. Do start to wonder if he was rushed back too early to try and make the World Cup and if that will have a negative impact on him long term.

Hopefully we will start exploring other options for next summer now as it is looking increasingly likely Falcao won’t be here next season, he could still turn it round but we have 27 league games left, he is going to miss the next 2 or 3, he then has to stay injury free, displace RVP or Rooney and then get himself fit and in form, it’s a big ask. He will do well to start 15-20 games between now and end of the season and unless he is exceptional in that time I think he will be a gamble that was worth taking but didn’t pay off.

3385~~~
Ogden knows bullshit.

3386~~~
He has become a joke since Moyes was sacked.

3387~~~
Here is a question, with Falcs still with a lot to prove and RvP looking a shadow of his former self, will we need 2 strikers in the summer?

3388~~~
Nah, just move Rooney up front, Mata behind him.

3389~~~
Depends on a lot.

<ol>
<li>Will RvP's stuttering form last all season - how much of a decline is he on?</li>
<li>How Falcao will fare once he gets a proper run in the team - is his injury really in the past?</li>
<li>Will Wilson show enough for a bigger role next season?</li>
<li>Would LvG trust Rooney up front if we had to get rid of RvP or Falcao?</li>
</ol>

3390~~~
I don't believe it for a second. That helps Monaco but doesn't help us. 

Has to be an agreed price but no obligation, with a sizeable loan fee. That helps all parties you'd think.

3391~~~
Me too.

You need to read the rumor mill to balance things out if you are feeling too happy on a particular day.

In -

ACL Valdes
ACL Strootman
ACL Falcao (Loan to permanent)
Mediocre Ron Vlaar
32 year old Darjio Srna
Washed Out Sneijder

Out -

De Gea
Herrera
Rafael
Smalling
Mata

Add the word 'philosophy' and it's as if we are building some self-destructive alcoholics Milan.

3392~~~
I think you're probably right. I think he's crocked and we'll be lucky to see him get a game, even from the bench, before Christmas.

3393~~~
I have no idea what to believe, Utd isn't immune from making mistakes. I guess only time will tell.

3394~~~
Unfortunately I don't think he's going to make it, which is a shame.

3395~~~
When I read some of the posts in this thread, I can only imagine the writers crying and stamping their feet as they type. Bunch of drama queens.

3396~~~
This. All this drama my god.

3397~~~
Just send him back already.

3398~~~
Yep. Injury hysteria has thoroughly set in on the caf. Every twisted ankle is received like a cancer diagnosis.

3399~~~
I'm still not too concerned. Reckon he'll be fine eventually.

3400~~~
This. It's laughable.

3401~~~
He has been pretty awful since Moyes left. Or should I say Ferdinand.

3402~~~
He will be brilliant for us over the last 25 games of the season - and the drama queens can faint from the excitement

3403~~~
Some of you are so dramatic <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He'll be back soon and he'll score goals.

3404~~~
For those of you calling us drama queens - if/when he comes back and plays for 80+ minutes per game, then you can say, "I told you so". 
Until then, us drama queens are correct. The guy is unable to play and this is a fact.
His knee has not recovered, yet. It may recover. It may not. Only time will tell.
Nobody, including Falcao/LvG, knows for sure if he will recover.

Realistically, if he does recover, it could be another 6 months before he is able to play a full 90 minute game for us.
It is clearly a very slow process of recovery.
At this point in time, I am (against) 60/40 (for).

For those suggesting that he will score 15-20 goals for us - can you explain how he is expected to get these, given that he is likely to miss the next 2 games, at least. This leaves only 25 games and remember, he cant play 80+ minutes.
Unless he starts scoring 1-2 goals per game, I cant see how he is going to reach these numbers.

3405~~~
His current injury is completely unrelated to his Knee so 80% of your post is bulkshit based on your own assumptions.

As for 15-20 goals in 25 games. If he can get fit he's more than capable of hitting those numbers even only playing 80m per game so it's not beyond the realms of possibility.

3406~~~
^^ This.

And barely a week after I posted a in-depth explanation of his current situation. I truly think some of the people here only see what they want to...

3407~~~
So dramatic.

3408~~~
Yep, 4 or 5 appearances by the turn of the year is a good return...look forward to similar next year!!

3409~~~
He's got really nice hair.

3410~~~
While he's injured perhaps we should start a poll: Which is nicer - His hair or watch collection?

3411~~~
Can't be bothered to check all the other threads but if the same drama queens are around, but going by their same logic regarding injuries we should not have bought Blind, Shaw, Rojo, Herrera let alone the players we already had who will/would have missed at least as many games as Falcao and we haven't even bought him yet

3412~~~
I was very excited by the Falcao loan, but have been really disappointed so far.

It's a predictable shame that posting in this thread has descended into one-up-manship and name calling.

Of course people are disappointed and concerned - we're a club with an absolutely <i>horrendous</i> injury record in recent times, and we've not even bought Falcao, we're paying high wages for a loan player to sit in the treatment room! In all honesty it's a comical situation.

He hasn't looked properly fit since he came here and I think it's perfectly fair to wonder whether this was a good or bad move.

You don't loan a player and pay them massive wages for them to sit in the treatment room. If it was known that he wasn't fit/recovered yet, we would've just loaned him from January onwards from Monaco when he was ready to play.

3413~~~
The different between people's feelings now and when we signed him is crazy. I was concerned when we got him and still am. He needs to get fit ASAP.

3414~~~
Stopped reading at this point. As Pexbo said his knee is not the issue at the minute so the rest of your post is pretty pointless really.

3415~~~
Oddly enough, I was never particularly excited about him coming unless it was on a Tevez-like rent a player type deal. He is coming off a serious injury and is already 29 in Feb, which means we may never see the same player that we saw during his Porto and Madrid days. If we're thinking of buying a top striker, we should be looking at players in the 22-25 age range, who are on the cusp of world class status, and who can play at a high level for a 3-5 years. In short, we need another 24 year old Ruud Van Nistelrooy.

3416~~~
From strictly a business stand point of view, his transfer is a no go

3417~~~
I remember the doubts when we signed RVN after his knee but yes I agree regarding age but we are verging on a desperate situation here with regards finishing out the top 4.

3418~~~
You were in the minority then. Did you see how many times I got called jealous because I suggested that this Falcao was possibly not the world class one you see in the Youtube compilations? Do you think you will be in for a new striker next summer?

3419~~~
I'd suggest that the people talking about 'drama queens' and whatnot are burying their heads in the sand.

What is dramatic about questioning whether a player that probably wont play again until mid December, has managed just 3 starts, scored 1 goal, not lasted a 90 minutes, and is earning (allegedly) £300,000K p/w, might not have been the best choice of transfer? Plenty of people had doubt about his fitness and those doubts, so far, have been proven worryingly correct.

3420~~~
The doubts were over his knee...it's not his knee.

3421~~~
The fact he hasn't managed to finish a game are because of his knee. And the doubts were also over the fact that he didn't look <i>that </i>great at Monaco, certainly not at his Porto/Athletico level.

3422~~~
There's something a tad dramatic about saying we'll work him up to full fitness, at which point he'll leave us and form a title winning partnership with Aguero next season at City.

3423~~~
Well yeah, that is a bit dramatic <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3424~~~
And that's what some posters are saying in this thread. 
I don't think things are bad as some people are making out, but I sure as hell would prefer them to be different than they are.

3425~~~
Really like the lad, carries himself impeccably in interviews and loves the club, however I often think Is he Darren Anderton in disguise sadly.

3426~~~
<a class="username" data-user="28415, @Sam" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28415/">@Sam</a> see, more dramatics. He's Darren Anderton now. 

Have a day off boys.

3427~~~
Anderton used to be fit at the start of the season so falcao is worse

Seriously. Not sure why anyone is trying desperately to defend the situation. He is probably  in the top 3 highest paid players in the squad. He had barely played and it will be mid season by the time he returns and I doubt anyone will be shocked if he picks up another knock then too.

If it wasn't the club I supported it would be a laughable situation. He was basically pushed onto the club at the final possible moment from out of the blue in a very odd situation. Now we are paying for a big name confined to the treatment room.

3428~~~
And I dont understand why people are desperately trying to write him off completely. 
The only thing we can do is look at him at the end of the season. As I've said a few times, I'm confident he'll prove himself over the course of the season.

3429~~~
Yeah, these posts aren't helping me here <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3430~~~
Persie isn't making it too hard for him to get back into the side, possibly next week.

3431~~~
Looks like Van Gaal is cooling any decision on a permanent move at the moment.

3432~~~
Has he started training already?

3433~~~
As long as he's available when the games start coming thick and fast over the Christmas period, I'm not too bothered.

3434~~~
LVG said he was resuming full training again today.

3435~~~

3436~~~
He'll probably replace RVP around the 60-70min mark against Hull then.

3437~~~
Great news. Probably too soon to start but hopefully he gets subbed on in the next couple of games and then gets a start at Southampton. Never properly got going yet because of the little niggles, but it's way too soon to write him off. When you're out for so long after an ACL injury, it's very rare that players come back without picking up other muscle injuries. Takes a while to get in the flow of things, but it has nothing to do with being injury prone. Just a matter of getting your body accustomed to playing high intensity football constantly.

3438~~~
Beat me to it! 

Lo lol olo lol ol ol ol Radamel Falcaoooooo!

3439~~~
I have a feeling that it's finally time for van Persie to be dropped.

3440~~~
He'll probably get himself injured again.

3441~~~
Having got to the stage where I've almost accepted that RVP is done at the top level, I really really hope Falcao can step it up and get back to the level he showed in his Athletico days.

If not, I'd be tempted to let both go this Summer and have a proper reshuffle upfront.

3442~~~
For Falcao? I doubt he's ready to start yet in terms of match fitness.

3443~~~
I hope you're right.

3444~~~
I don't want to get my hopes up, but the thought of him coming back and banging the goals in gives me the horn.

3445~~~
Hope RVP enjoys the bench.

3446~~~
Cannot wait to see him back, can't be worse than RVP surely?

3447~~~
I think it was worth the risk. If he comes back and then gets injured again, then that will probably be after the new year that he would be available again, and for the wages, well...it's really probably not worth it. Still think it was a good punt though and....you never know.

3448~~~
Really hope he stays fit and gets in the team and we see the best of him

3449~~~
If he hits or even shows sporadic glimmers of his Madrid form, we could go on a serious run.

3450~~~
Hiding one knee from the camera. Definitely something wrong with it, maybe even an icepack on it there. Crock. Get rid.

3451~~~
I always thought you get a day off after a match? Surprised to see them training today especially after an away game!

3452~~~
They had enough rest while they've all been constantly injured.

Lazy fuks. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3453~~~
Thing is, after that Everton goal I thought he'd kick on and score a feck load. LVG was saying that he expected him to start firing after that international break, but it wasn't to be...

Hopefully he comes back confident and starts winning us valuable points.

3454~~~
That's the thing with long term injuries, it takes a while to get back into the swing of things and get that consistency with your fitness. He was our for so long so of course it'll take a while for his body to adjust and get back to full fitness and stay clear of the little niggles. Hopefully he's over them now and can get a run of games, as the brief time he played was encouraging in terms of his overall play.

3455~~~
That picture of Falcao training looks old as how come Utd players are back in training after yesterday game.

3456~~~
Two games in four days coming up so hopefully he can get some minutes.

3457~~~
Anyone but Rvp.

3458~~~
If he is ready he should come on for either Wilson or Mata after 45 minutes. RVP shouldn't start

3459~~~
A rare Anderson sighting too!

3460~~~
I'd love Handsome Tevez to finally show us what he can do in a red shirt.

3461~~~
Anderson is going to get a testimonial......Isn't he?!

3462~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3463~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3464~~~
With 3 games in 10 days, he will definitely get a start I assume. Probably coming on sub against Hull and starting vs Stoke might be how it will be.

3465~~~
Handsome and eloquent.

3466~~~
Falcao can tell the time too so he wont get stuck playing golf in Columbia for months...

3467~~~
once he's fully fit, it'd be interesting to see him as a lone frontman.

something needs to shape VP up though.

For all the competition talk at the start of the season, he's not really had any, he's played, with only a couple of substituions

3468~~~
Can't wait to see him again.

3469~~~
I want this man to score goals.

3470~~~
Unexpainable man love with Falcao.

He's just such a nic3 gui

3471~~~
This.

Also no way Mata is smiling at the moment..

3472~~~
Perfect timing for the busy Christmas period.

3473~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3474~~~
We just want to see Falcao banging in goals at the Stretford End. Please lord is it too much to ask <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Seriously can't wait for him to get back. You just get that feeling that once he gets the engine running, gets a few games under his belt, then he will start firing and there will be no looking back.

3475~~~
But on which hand is he wearing his watch though? Can't see it <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3476~~~
Guys, Falcao is currently recovering from a long term, serious, career threatening injury.
He also had a new calf injury which seems to be taking a (suspiciously) long time to recover.
What makes you guys think he will start in the next 2 weeks?

My prediction is that he may play 20 minutes (per game) in the next 2 weeks but 45 minutes is pushing it too far.

This guy is extremely fragile and needs to be brought back slowly.
I simply cannot understand where people are getting information from that Falcao is ready to play 45+ minutes or even start a game.

I stated this in the Arsenal Match thread and people kept putting Falcao in the starting 11. I even asked in there why people are putting an injured player in their team and got some irrational responses.

And for those who think RvP wont be starting for Man Utd....you clearly havent learnt anything about LvG. He'll probably be the 2nd name (after Rooney) to go on the team sheet.

In 2-3 months IF Falcao is able to play 90 minutes, then Falcao may be ahead of RvP in the pecking order, but as of 24/11/2014, RvP is our No.1 striker. Get used to it.

3477~~~
His 'new injury' was the recent injury he picked up, he just wasn't match fit. Van Gaal called it 'new' because he was trying to differentiate it from his actual ACL injury. He's more lacking match fitness than injured.

3478~~~
Why do people think he will be played over rvp or he will suddenly start banging them in? Has any of you seen him at Monaco, he wasn't the Falcao who came 3rd in the POTY the year before... Still s good player but I don't see Van Gal suddenly dropping his love child RVP, unfortunately....

3479~~~
The picture Falcao shared looks like an old one but thats no surprise, why would he bother sourcing a brand new photo for the benefit of a tweet? The new UNited shared shows only players who were subs or didn't play against Arsenal. It wouldn't be a surprise if they did light work the following day even if they played 90mins.

3480~~~
Really hope he get some minutes against Hull, doubt it though, Van Gaal seems to not want to play players unless they are 100% match fit. 

Any u21 games coming up that he can get game time, imagine what he would do in one of them games <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

3481~~~

3482~~~
That'a'boy.

3483~~~
Bloody hell, we have the United Phsio on the Caf.  Got any other great insight to our injuries you care to share.
Stop making out you are the knowledge on his injury - you aren't.  You are just speculating like everyone else. Get used to it!

3484~~~
Such a good lad, hope he rips the league apart.

3485~~~
Don't have an issue if he is brought back slowly, 15 mins here, 25 mins there. Next two games would be a good opportunity for him to get some time in (hopefully) pretty benign conditions.

We will need him against Southampton thats for sure.

Can't wait to see him at 100%!!

3486~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3487~~~
Obviously crocked again and Herrera and Ando have been enlisted to do a Weekend At Bernie's on him.

3488~~~

3489~~~
Finally a holding role that Anderson isn't useless at

3490~~~
Full video

3491~~~
Looks like Rojo's back too.

3492~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Didn't think I'd be missing that lad.

3493~~~
Everyone in high spirits and Rojo is out there. Good to see.

3494~~~
All season I've noticed we've looked a much happier squad, which is amazing considering our luck on the field and with injuries. LVG has really brought the squad together.

3495~~~
Hopes are getting higher, as if a legend is finally released, how many articles, photo's, vids have the club posted about him coming back, at least 4 I think, that's pretty unusual.

3496~~~
Really think he'll be class in time. Just needs to stay fit and fully recover. Not worried about the little injuries as they are to be expected when somebody is out for so long as he was. Takes a while to cut those out. If he's over those knocks now, and stays fit, I reckon from new years onwards he'll be back to his best and starting every week. There's certainly the chance for him to cement his spot up there with RvP being past it. 

Can't wait to see him starting games again though.

3497~~~
This deserved a <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3498~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I'm going to miss Ando when he goes. Can't we make him an ambassador or something?

3499~~~
Anderson's latest takeaway...

(btw, Ando actually looks in decent shape here)

3500~~~
Our new 4-3-3 with him on top and Rooney as an attacking midfielder could be something special.

3501~~~
But where will RvP play...!?

3502~~~
Happy to be so wrong-great to see Falcao training.   Wonder if Jaime Jackson had some ice ready for Falcao?

3503~~~
Ando looks in great shape tbf.

3504~~~
Hope to see him at the weekend at some point. Get a few mins under his belt, then hopefully some full games. The goals will come no doubt about it. 
He has to start vs liverpool and their shite defence <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

3505~~~
The way Mata helps De Gea with his gloves <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3506~~~
Can't wait to see more from him.

3507~~~
I think that was the joke.

3508~~~
I want him to succeed here more than anybody, I don't know why.

3509~~~
Bravo.
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Falcao must have promised him a trip to Nandos.

3510~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>>>>

3511~~~
In the reserves?

3512~~~
He really didn't do anything wrong in the very little game-time he's had with us. Only three starts, none of them 90 minutes, and he'd already racked up a goal and two assists (including an absolute beauty for RVP). Almost more importantly, he looked really sharp, energetic and dangerous when he played.

I've noticed a lot of caftards doing that typical fan thing of lowering their opinion of a player's pre-injury form the longer they're injured for.

Really excited for his return, hopefully against Hull... and hopefully in place of RVP!

3513~~~
Reminds me of last year when a lot of people were writing off Bale when he had barely even played due to injury and the few games he did play early on in the season were through injury or when he barely had match practice. He had a good November but things did not really click for him until late January and in the end he had a strong finish to the season. It's way too early to write off a player when he has barely kicked a ball for the team but the media likes to encourage it as it creates stories, causes social media buzz and fills pages. Until Falcao gets an extended run in the team it is not possible to gauge what level he is at.

3514~~~
Why do they mute all the training videos?

3515~~~
We don't want our philosophy to be leaked..

3516~~~
So that no one outside hears our philosophy <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3517~~~
They probably started muting the training sessions last year because the club did not want to be embarrassed by anything that Moyes was saying.

3518~~~
Same. It's odd; he is a striker coming off of the back of a - perhaps not career threatening, but a high potential to hamper a players top abilities - injury at a fairly awkward age for a striker on very high wages, but I really want him to succeed. He just seems like a very humble player who seems genuinely happy to be here. But, is it really this simplistic? His last season - whilst plagued by the aforementioned injury - was still pretty average, but there is still world class there. Maybe this desire to see him advance is being developed by van Persie's terrible form? Maybe there's some sort of synonymous cathartic release -- Falcao is in a similar situation to Manchester United as a club; a 'sleeping giant' - so close, yet so far to being back at the level they once were. Maybe we sympathise with that?

3519~~~
Haha, can't see it happening, man. 

He needs dropping, of course, but Van Gaal has played him more than any other outfield player (I think)...

3520~~~
'If all else fails lump it up to Mr Elbows'

3521~~~
I'm so glad he's back. If we're going to get the best out of him, we need to continue to play one up top, in my opinion. Don't think he'll start against Hull, but hopefully he will against Stoke.

3522~~~
Cant wait to seem him start and finish a few games in a row.

3523~~~
Love the way they are having some fun over the rumours, hopefully he gets a decent amount of game time over the next 3 matches.

3524~~~
Rojo was training last week too

3525~~~
Agreed - the priority has to be to get him healthy, not for us but for him as a person. I can't help fearing that the rush to get him ready for the World Cup or back in the shop window with Monaco could potentially have done long-term damage in terms of his full recovery. I realise this latest injury isn't ACL-related, but if he needs more time then I'd prefer to be overly cautious with him.

That said, you can't help but be excited by the prospect of him playing for us <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3526~~~
I think the star quality he has brings a great atmosphere to the club too. You can just see the fans getting excited, even with him warming up on the touchline - not many people have that ability.

I imagine he will be replacing RVP or Rooney at about 15-20 mins to go. Hope he can really kick on from here and stay fit for the rest of the season.

3527~~~
This is what I think will happen over the next few weeks.

3528~~~
Happy to be back in the call and ready to enjoy the magic of Old Trafford

<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Can't wait to see him back in action.

3529~~~
The new lads have a good attitude and outlook to playing for us. Di Maria is the only one that feels a bit out of place right now and he's our record signing.

3530~~~
Did he say this?!

3531~~~
that was only media speculation wasn't it?  He celebrated like feck when we scored against arsenal!

3532~~~

3533~~~
If he really wants to stay fit he should stay away from walls.

3534~~~
Horrifying finish.

3535~~~
It was blocked on the line. Not sure what's particularly horrifying about it.

3536~~~
El Gato

3537~~~
How so? 

You know sometimes defenders just make good clearances...

3538~~~
That'll do him a world of good. A few more minutes against Stoke and he'll be firing for Southampton.

3539~~~
Plus difficult to take as it was played a bit behind him

3540~~~
Great play in the build up between him and Mata and unlucky Dawson was there on the line. First game back but looking good.

3541~~~
Nice to see Mata give him the ball when it was on his left foot and he could have put away a finish himself, with ease. Shame it didn't go in.

Would loved to have seen Falcao involved in some of our first half play. He came on well after the sting had gone from the game, and we were simply seeing it out. Really hope he starts against Stoke.

3542~~~
He links play up great. The difficult part was that the game was dying at that point, if we keep playing like that in the first half and he's playing then he will surely score goals.

3543~~~
It would've capped off a perfect evening apart from the injury had he scored, such a pity.

3544~~~
Thus spake the football professor.

3545~~~
The strength he showed in the buildup to the move isn't something that either Rooney or RvP possess. He's looked good every single game he's played. Really hope he starts vs Stoke but I don't see it happening.

3546~~~
Can't really see what was wrong with the finish. He hit the target but it was blocked on the line. I've seen some people saying it was a sitter.

3547~~~
Unlucky with his shot getting blocked. Great hold up and linkup play. 

Should be starting Tuesday or at least getting more minutes.

3548~~~
He's hold up play is brilliant. Wish he had scored

3549~~~
Can't blame him for not putting that one in the back of the net....he's hardly played for practically a year for fecks sake...

3550~~~
All he needs is more game time.I think with the busy christmas period,he will have more important role to play.

3551~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3552~~~
Shame he wasn't out there when we were attacking. The one time we went forward when he was on, he gets a great chance which he doesn't do much wrong with, just a great block. 

Glad for RVP getting his goal but so pleased to see Falcao back.

3553~~~
Shevchenkkkkk... oh.

3554~~~
A true Kevin, aren't you.

Had a good cameo I thought. Brilliant link up play. Unlucky not to score.

3555~~~
He still doesn't look fully confident but I think that it is only a matter of time vefore he will start scoring a lot of goals. His general play is very good, it has to be said.

3556~~~
he always looks so strong.

sure we sill see him start matches with teh holiday schedule coming up.

3557~~~
His overall play is superb. Shame he is not able to put them in back of net right now but it should only be matter of time if he plays regularly.

3558~~~
Ideal chance for him to start against Stoke, only three days between the two games so give RVP a rest I think.

Such a shame he didn't score that chance <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3559~~~
Disappointed he didn't score, should hopefully get some more minutes vs. Stoke on Tuesday.

3560~~~
We put the foot off the gas after RVPs goal so he annoyingly didn't get as much chances as he should have.

Hopefully he'll get a start against Stoke, he holds up the ball incredibly well.

3561~~~
It'd be nice to have him on the pitch when we haven't taken our foot 80% off the gas to coast through the end of the game.

3562~~~
Don't think he'll start against Stoke, though I guess there is a good chance of that considering our luck with injuries and Van Gaal being cautious about not injuring RvP or Rooney by playing twice in a week. Good cameo from him though, should have scored but it was a great block, didn't really do anything wrong. His hold up play is excellent though, and there's a lot more to come.

3563~~~
Deserved more from his cameo today. Looked threatening at every turn.

3564~~~
Another 20-30 minutes against Stoke would be good. Start RvP after his goal today, allow him to build on that while bringng on Falcaos match fitness. Also lets see how Rooney is, might not be 100% for Tuesday.

3565~~~
He did well when he came on despite the fact we had slowed to walking pace at times. The piece of play where he linked with Mata deserved a goal.

3566~~~
Shame he came on when the game was done and dusted, you could tell he wanted to push but the rest of the team were just cruising by then. Good few minutes under the belt though, that goal would've been perfect.

3567~~~
such a shame that great move didn't finish with a goal

3568~~~
Yup, I agree with that.

3569~~~
I just want him to get some momentum so he can really catch fire. Must stay fit of course and then surely he'll be providing the goals and assists we know he can. You could see even in those late stages he was getting in the right positions, but the ball didn't fall right, or that chance blocked on the line was another near miss. It's great to have him available again and we're all so desperate to see him succeed.

3570~~~
Why has he turned into Michael Owen?

Cannot finish for toffee after once being about as lethal as it gets.

3571~~~
According to the Daily Express we're not interested in buying him so we can buy Cavanni from PSG. Sounds rubbish.

3572~~~
It's the express, of course it's rubbish.

3573~~~
He's got a hell of a lot of work to do to justify any £44 million price tag in the summer.

I wonder if we have the option to re-negotiate a price if he doesn't hit those heights?

3574~~~
We possibly could, but then we'd not have the first option anymore.

3575~~~
Hmmm, its going to be an interesting situation to say the least.

3576~~~
How did he play today? I see a lot of 'great move' 'great hold up play' and 'the ball just didnt fall right '. When was he put on?

3577~~~
He's a strong bastard, isn't he? I do like that side of his game, it has to be said.

3578~~~
At about 70 mins. I thought he was pretty good for his first game in almost a month (?). The usual that we have seen from him. Unselfish, good link up play, works hard. Had a good chance to score but hit it at the keeper. He was involved in the build up to that chance

3579~~~
In all honesty he was barely involved. He came on once we'd basically decided to play keep ball for the last half an hour, so he didn't have much to feed off. Had one nice moment near the end where he linked up well with Mata, he played him in, then got the return and Dawson cleared his shot off the line.

3580~~~
It's getting ridiculous now, I won't be surprised if Falcao himself says he'll pass. Falcao is top, top player when he goes to another team and starts banging in the goals don't be shocked.

3581~~~
Just saw his pass to Mata for the chance that he didn't score. Obviously wasn't the most difficult of balls but the way he kept possession and drove forward was great. Then the ball itself was perfectly weighted and didn't push Mata out any wider than needed. Shame he didn't score.

3582~~~
Can't wait for him to get a run of games, new awesome, given a run of games and you can see him destroying teams. Excited.

3583~~~
If he stays fit the goals will come.. He just oozes class..

3584~~~
I think players are trying too hard to get him involved and get him to score, the goals will come I am sure.

Loved the strength he displayed in the build-up to his chance.

3585~~~
His finishing is supposed to be lethal and movement first class but it is his strength I have been most impressed with. He holds the ball up brilliantly. Shame he didn't score but at least he is fit now. Just have to get minutes into him.

3586~~~
He is a really strong player. I thought he did well today, its a shame he didn't get that goal.

3587~~~
He'll need to do better than his finish for his chance today then.

3588~~~
Well, his two assists and a goal from three starts pre-injury suggest that won't be a problem.

Ffs, it was a 15-minute run-out for a player who obviously isn't up to match-fitness yet. Why are so many so desperate to believe that our own players aren't good enough?

3589~~~
Got subbed on in the 75th minute or so, and was pretty good. As you'd expect at that stage the game was more or less dead, all he did was just normal little passes when the ball came to him. He had the one bit where he did really well to hold the ball up and sneak past someone on the turn, played in Mata who cut it back for him but somebody slid in and blocked the shot on the line.

3590~~~
It really is strange. You see people on here constantly downplaying how good Di maria, all the shit people said about Herrera when he was injured and now Falcao. You also see it with Mata, Rojo and anyone else really. It's so weird that people on here are constantly so negative about us and how good some of our players are, so quick to write them off.

3591~~~
They particularly like to equate being injured to being out of form or just plain bad. The longer one of our players is injured, the worse he was pre-injury in the heads of some caftards. Falcao was looking very promising in his few little run-outs for us before the calf injury, and most people were pleased with him. Now history's been rewritten and it's as if he was rubbish.

Rafael suffers massively from this. The lad's hardly put in a performance that wasn't at the very least 'good' and more often than not 'excellent' for three years, but every time he gets injured those performances start to degrade in the heads of some posters.

3592~~~
I didn't say he wasn't good enough. Let's not dress up the fact he missed a sitter today though.

3593~~~
His one chance on goal. And he didn't <i>miss</i> it, it was saved. Mata puts it slightly further in front of him, he can lift it over the keeper rather than having to drag it along the ground.

But that's not the point anyway. As I said, he's clearly not match-fit yet, hence the short run out. He showed enough before his injury to more than merit the chance to get that match fitness back and have a proper crack at showing what he's made of.

3594~~~
Hopefully the seeming return to the 4-4-2 diamond will allow him to build up a head of steam re match fitness... What he has shown so far is certainly promising!

3595~~~
Of course it was a miss. The keeper was completely out of the picture. He was a great striker but he hasn't shown it for United yet. I'm sure he will though if he stays fit. Van Persie would've been slaughtered here if he had missed that chance.

3596~~~
Not in a 15-minute cameo intended to help move him towards match fitness.

He hasn't shown it for United yet, no. He hasn't had enough game time to really show <i>anything</i> for United yet. But with a goal and a couple of assists (including a beauty for RVP), he's certainly shown enough to be given a proper chance once he's fit again. Which is why I find it bizarre that people are already coming to conclusions like 'he's not the player he was, we should send him back'.

3597~~~
Its just united fans being themselves,overly critical and desperate to write him off.Every season there is a player who must face this, falcao is the bait this season.

3598~~~
We are trying so hard to be anti-RAWK that its going overboard.

3599~~~
The conclusion that we would regret not signing him is equally bizarre though. You don't need to be match fit to stick the ball in a net with no keeper in it.

3600~~~
So for him to score a goal, he will need to do better than he did with a chance where he didn't score a goal?

Mind well and truely blown.

3601~~~
The man has finally spoken..BOOM!!

3602~~~
Thought he did OK, not much else you can say about 15 minutes really. Sure he missed that chance but he did really well to help create it. Looking forward to seeing more of him. Amazing to have a player of his calibre on the bench!

3603~~~
For us to regret not signing him he'll need to do better. Your mind must be exploding now.

3604~~~
We made a 6m loan punt on a player who, previous to his injury, was the best striker in the world. 


He's at the end of his rehabilitation and will suffer other little setbacks before he is 100% strong and supple. 

I can forgive him for having a shot cleared of the line in his first 15 minute cameo in 5 weeks after having the best part of a year off before that. Especially when we are 3-0 up and Van Gaal put him on to stretch his legs and find his touch. 

Your patience, or lack of, is hilarious.

3605~~~
Dont think he is really strong, have seen him lose plenty of duels (aerial, shoulder to shoulder), but when he gets the chance to shield the ball, you cant push him away, maybe the first has to do with his fitness and rythm. Won under 10% of all his aerial battles, that's not good.

3606~~~
Nah he's very strong. 

I find people giving him stick for the chance funny, he did what he had to and Dawson just made a very good clearance. He'll start banging them in soon, I have no doubts.

3607~~~
Agree. These kind of players don't come around very often, if he's 75% the player he was, he'll still be better than 90% of the strikers out there.....

3608~~~
It's bizarrely endemic in this forum isn't it? 

I've seen enough of Falcao already to be convinced he's got a ton of goals in him. And RVPs goal yesterday hasn't swayed me from my view that Falcao should start over him when fully mach fit and ready. It will be criminal if he doesn't get a run of games here and the chance to make a deal permanent.

3609~~~
You're going out of your way to be critical about Falcao - we get it, you aren't convinced. Don't get me wrong, you're a bloody good poster, but you're overly critical of Falcao.

I say it just needs patience. By many accounts, he's been training brilliantly since returning and what he needs now is minutes under his belt. It's utterly pointless judging him on yesterday's cameo, which will have been about blowing away the cobwebs for 20-25 minutes.

There's still 25 league games, plus FA Cup, to come this season - with Falcao's track record, 15 goals isn't beyond the realms of realism. Half a season scoring at that ratio should assuage any fears.

3610~~~
What would be the point of paying 44 m for a player who is 29,maybe injury prone and has a goal ratio Rooney could easily match if he was being played as a striker?

3611~~~
Judgment must be suspended until the season's end. Club will then have a better picture on Falcao's long term fitness prospects.

Point I was making is if he has half a season of uninterrupted goalscoring form, that'll give the decision makers confidence. 29 is peak age, so not sure why you're ready to pension him off.

3612~~~
In those 20 odd minutes he had you could see how good a player he is, with the  Christmas period fast approaching we couldn't ask for a better time to have a fresh, fit Falcao in the team. He is going to be immense.

3613~~~
29 is the new 30

3614~~~
The chance he missed (well blocked on the line) only happened in the first place because of his strength to start with and his perfect pass to Mata. He's showing he's more than just a pure goal poacher.

3615~~~
Because we have all seen how fast a top class striker on his peak can just fade/decline, saw it with RVP, saw it with Villa, Eto'o, Henry, Drogba, we have Rooney at the club, and we (should) have other priorities.

3616~~~
I blame Wenger and his only a one year contact policy for 30 year olds. Ridiculous.

3617~~~
Not a conclusive sample as far as I'm concerned.

RvP - not definitely long term decline, LvG reckons just bad form. Also, look at likes of Bergkamp and Sheringham.

Villa was more to do with him sustaining a broken leg. Also, had to play a slightly diffferent role in a unique Barca system. Same sort of thing with Henry, actually.

Didier has had good form during his 30s. Eto'o regression understandable as he was a speed demon.

3618~~~
All maybe okay, but not bangin them in as before (except Drogba, he scored 29 league goals when he was (30/31)). I dont think RVP is a form question, he hasnt been near his first season form since SAF left, and especially in the year 2014 he has been overally poor, scoring under 10 league goals in the whole year. I just dont think it's worthy taking that risk when we have Roo at the club, and other priorities, obviously if Falcao hits his form and maintains it, it would be a good buy, but there is also a huge possibility that it turns the other way around.

3619~~~
You can't rely on one player at this level. Falcao as we know can be the best striker in the world, clinical. It's not just about the raw numbers though, it's about percentages. 

Remember that chance Welbeck had against Bayern? One on one with Neuer and he looked like a rabbit in the headlights. Strikers like Falcao when fit and played into form eat those chances for breakfast. That's what you pay for his quality.

3620~~~
Yes sir.

3621~~~
The prices are stupidly high for top strikers. If and big if he can replicate his old form from Atletico in the second half of the season there is no doubt we should buy it. We will get a top top striker who will be on top of his game for at least two seasons.

When you look RvP transfer there are not a lot people who would say we made a mistake even if he really delivered just in one season. And when people give RvP as example how quick player can decline they are forgeting that he can still get his form back and be top striker for this and one more season. He showed what he can do with his goal against Hull.

3622~~~
Exactly.

3623~~~
actually that may just be you if you're serious about the use of the word "regret" here

3624~~~
I think that we either let hum go or Woodie will knock the price down. Theres no way i hell we re keeping him at price and wages.

3625~~~
He should've scored that chance yesterday.

3626~~~
How would people feel if we got him on loan for another season if he has a strong second half to the season (injury free and chipping in with a few goals) ?

3627~~~
His movement and hold up play is just superb.

The goals will soon come and they wont stop.

3628~~~
Havent Rooney and RVP proved in the past that you can, but we dont have to rely on one player, we got players now like Di Maria, Mata, Herrera, Rvp, (one new winger) who can also be built on.

3629~~~
Gotta feel for him missing his only chance but to be fair of the 15 minutes he was on, we spent at least 10-12 of those minutes passing around our defense.. god it was boring..

3630~~~
Why do you think Monaco would agree to that? They'll be trying to off-load him for big money so that they don't get in FFP trouble.

3631~~~
Didn't really "Miss" a sitter though..

It was on target, the Hull defender just pulled off a superb block as he was right in the path of the ball from about 4 yards out, so not exactly much room to manoeuvre the ball into the corner or something, it happens. Plus the fact that he is getting in those positions is very promising too.

Ronaldos chip OVER the bar from 3 yards out with no keeper or player in the way? THAT is missing a sitter.

3632~~~
Is saying a player hasn't shown he's been good enough yet or that he missed a sitter a lack of patience or an honest assessment of what's happened to date? Did you bother reading where I said if he stays fit I think he'll do well?

3633~~~
It's your suggestion that missing that 'sitter' means anything about his chances with us that betrays a lack of patience.

3634~~~
If Falcao lifts the ball a couple of feet the defender has no chance. How anyone can say with straight face that wasn't a miss or he couldn't have done better is beyond me.

3635~~~
It was pointing out its a weird time to be talking about how we'll pay the price if we don't sign him. So far he hasn't shown himself to be the lethal striker we were told.

3636~~~
This. No one knows if he will become the player of his glory days, but writing him off yet is stupid. You people do realize how incredibly good he was at Atheltico? Easily top 5 worldwide as a CF. If he can find back to that form, he will be a greater revelation than RvP in 2012-13

3637~~~
It's not even as if we're still waiting for a good performance from him. He was excellent throughout against Leicester. He provided energy and great movement up front, turned away from his markers to show them a clean pair of heels three or four times, had a number of good efforts on goal, including this stunner...

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xlZvm9dYWWQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

... and created RVP's opener single-handedly by skinning his man down the wing and then producing a pinpoint cross that RVP would have struggled <i>not</i> to put into the goal:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kccNSdlXg9Q?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

It's no coincidence that we lost control of that match when he and Di Maria went off.

3638~~~
I admit I probably am being over critical of him, I guess I've just got massive expectation from him, what with the reputation he's come here with, the record he has, and the amount of money he is (and might) cost us.

3639~~~
How dare he not get over his injuries and adapt to English football immediately?

3640~~~
Throw him out we say!!! *Pitch forks & fire torches ready*

3641~~~
I was speaking Hypothetically if they did allow him out on loan again.

3642~~~
He will score goals for fun as soon as he finds fitness and form. I think we will see this soon. 

Btw, some of you guys who starting to turn on Falcao, did you guys rate Diego Costa high in Brazil?

3643~~~
What on earth has that got to do with how they rate Falcao? Costa does not fit into the Spanish side at all, they even dropped him for the last 2 games.

Costa has scored 11 in 11 games in the PL, thats how they rate him. Hes second only to Aguero in the PL.

3644~~~
To be fair, I actually thought he could have done better with his chance. It was a good block but he's meant to be one of the best finishers in the world. I understand he was rusty though so I'll put it down to that.

3645~~~
He just made it back from injury to play in Brazil. Everyone need time after a serious injury. Many people thought that Costa could have been a shit signing for Chelsea after seeing him in Brazil. 

My point is that Falcao need time to get his fitness and form back. It will happen.

3646~~~
At 29 he isn't worth a 40m+ fee.

3647~~~
No one is saying that it wasn't a miss. It was. It just wasn't a sitter. He did as well as he could with a ball given slightly behind him, the shot was on target and went past the keeper and it required a very good last ditch clearance by Dawson for it not to go in.

3648~~~
Watch it again. From his view he couldn't have had a clue that Dawson was coming across the line. He did everything messes army as far as he could know to guide it carefully towards goal and if Dawson wasn't there, which he wasn't as far as Falcao knew, it's a goal. 

Making things difficult by going for some sort of dink or chip is just asking for an embarrassing miss at an empty net.

3649~~~
I know that he was unlucky with his injuries since he came to United, but to be honest I’m starting to be frustrated by him. When he was at Atletico he was a monster, I remember his game against Chelsea when he scored 4 goals and was unbelievable, but his year in France and his injury changed him.

I’m worried about LVG choice. It’s true that Welbz’s left, like Chicha, but we’re in December and Falcao has just scored one goal since… He’s not giving or delivering what he should. I’m frustrated by him, and having RVP out of form/confidence and him not well, it only left Rooney as the main striker.

I would like him to prove me wrong soon but I’m not that confident, I think that we’ll struggle with our strikers this season

3650~~~
Be worried by all means, that's your right, but he's had 271 mins of Premier League football (<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.whoscored.com/Players/18701/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">WhoScored</a>). Coming off a big injury and suffering another minor injury too with a new culture, manager and set up plus more competition for places than he's ever experienced before. On top of that, when he's played he's looked considerably more threatening than RVP thus far. He's also assisted twice and scored already not to mention could have had a hat trick for Colombia where 2 goal bound shots were stolen from him on the line.

I'd give him a bit more time myself before judging it quite to the manner above. He's about to go through his first winter of football and games coming every few days too. Touch wood his injuries are behind him and he scores a sh*t load.

3651~~~
I was there on Saturday, and I'd have loved to see him score (live). Cant believe he didnt when Mata tee'd him up late on

Really want to see him get 90 minutes in

3652~~~
There's an interesting comment from Van Gaal when he's discussing Anderson:

I wonder if Falcao might get a run out for our U-21s?

Oh the indignity!

3653~~~
Give him time to get back to his best. His all round play has been very good so far, he just needs a run in the first team to get going. He will eventually get there and I still expect him to knock 15 goals this season in the league.

3654~~~
Once again it appears that fans are getting impatient again. Despite what we might like to think or what conspiracy theories we want to believe, the simplest explanation is the one that LVG has given, that he has certain fitness standards and he expects players to meet them before he lets them play full matches or start.

Falcao, despite his stellar reputation, did undergo a major injury and more niggly ones over here. Why are some fans getting frustrated? We can recognize the need for playing into form with Rooney for example, so why are people upset that Falcao isn't firing on all cylinders with only the handful of minutes he has played.

3655~~~
Indignity? I think it's fairly sensible for a player trying to reach full fitness, haven't many of our players played with the reserves after injuries?

Obviously depends on the timing as well, if Van Gaal makes him plays with the second team now, it's a bit silly and embarrassing given he was ready to play with the first team, but if he meant a couple of weeks ago, nothing wrong with that imo.

3656~~~
Frustrated is probably the wrong word, I'd say concerned. And thats because in about 6 months time we've got to make a decision on whether to spend £44 million on a (soon to be) 29 year old who, up until now, has failed to get himself fit enough to last a game (not his fault, but still a fact) or put in any performances to justify spending anywhere near that kind of money on him. 

Its a huge amount of money for a player who hasn't really been 'world class' since 2013, has suffered his second ACL injury of his career, and is going to be nearing 29 in the Summer. We'd all love him to find that Athletico form again, it would be absolutely fantastic to have a player like that playing for United, but I don't see why its so outrageous to be worried he might not find that form again, and therefore think that £44 million could be spent much more wisely. All season people have been saying, 'oh just wait till he hits form, he'll score so many' and things like that, well its December and he's managed one goal.

3657~~~
I'm guessing Pogue was just joking <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> 

But yeah, there's no problem with him getting some minutes for the U21's to build his fitness even more. The only thing I'd be vary of is some random aggressive youngster who would be out to make a name for himself..

3658~~~
Sheringham, Solskjaer, Yorke, Cole

Tevez, Ronaldo, Rooney, Berbatov

Rooney, Falcao, Van Persie, Di Maria

Says it all really <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3659~~~
I fail to see that as a problem. Just the opposite, its a luxury position to be in. Even if he'd been banging them in for Monaco & Colombia and hadn't been injured, Id much rather get him in on loan with an option to buy than just buy outright. Try before you buy, if only we could do that with every expensive player. That's a great position for the club to be in. If he stays injured, or fails to regain his form, we don't pick up his option. Simple.

3660~~~
Correct. I'd actually like to see him start for the U-21s. Needs some football and could probably do with a confidence boost too.

3661~~~
Absolutely agree with that.

3662~~~
I think LvG is being cautious in bringing him back-and that's OK.  But obviously Falcao needs to show he can play meangingful minutes in a string of games.

On buying Falcao, I think in terms of amortizing his fee over a period of time in which he displays true class. By the end of this year I think we'll know whether or not he has returned to a world class form.  If yes, then I think his fee is worth it if we expect to get three years at that level.  I think expecting continued top performances between 29-32 is reasonable.

3663~~~
Yeah, I would be very happy with three top class seasons from him - I wouldn't bet against us winning one of the two big ones during that period if he really gets going.

3664~~~
I wondered whether it was serious or not, sorry for misunderstanding!

3665~~~
If we want to sign him beyond this season it should be on loan for another year or we should be looking to halve the £44m fee, 6 months of football isn’t enough time to shell out that kind of money on a 29 year old who won’t have had a good season since 2012/13. He is coming back at the right time as he should get some starts given all the games coming up and ideally he will have a brilliant 6 months and give LVG a difficult decision to make.

3666~~~
The keeper was taken out by the pass. You're being generous.

3667~~~
I've watched it enough. You don't have to dink or chip a ball to get it off the ground.

3668~~~
So he's supposed to try and smash it in the roof of what appears to be an empty net. 

Yeah that seems like the smart thing to try with a ball that is slightly behind you from 8 yards out.

3669~~~
I'd say frustrated is a fair word. Concerned would more be if you had paid a huge fee. Its possibly down to the hype surrounding his arrival and his previous reputation. If we were to sign say Robben(again) Messi or Ronaldo etc the excitement levels would go through the roof, if then they were constantly injured or werent performing to their old standards its natural to be annoyed and frustrated.

Although it seems odd that pro and con Falcoa'ers are getting involved in huge tactical debates over whether or not the chance  against Hull was easy or  slightly less easy. Dont seem to remember Atletico having these debates!

3670~~~
I think that it's even worse because he seems to be good enough for our ambitions, it's only the injuries who are messing up everything.

3671~~~
I didn't realise Falcao had zero peripheral vision or awareness of what happens on a football pitch. Saying a player missed a sitter isn't a damning indictment of a player no matter how much people in this thread want to get their knickers in a twist and have a fictitious argument about how he's being shown no patience.

3672~~~
He is not in the rythm, you will see that when/if he plays more.

3673~~~
You're making too much out of it: it's the nature of a forum, some believe it's a sitter, others don't. People exchange their opinions. It's not 'a huge tactical debate'.
He's going to be, he's just had the start to the season ravaged by niggling injuries. I think he's going to be instrumental during the festive period and kick on big time during the second half of the season.

3674~~~
Which is fair enough and I wouldn't be surprised if he did. I still think painting a picture of how he couldn't have done any more with that chance is both nonsense and doing the player a disservice to suggest he can't do better.

3675~~~
It's also disingenuous to claim it was a sitter.

3676~~~
Not if you believe it was. The keeper is out of goal and he's 7 yards out. Until you can give me a dictionary definition of the term and it shows different I'm calling that a sitter. Saying he can't know the defender is there is nonsense. Did he run to goal with his eyes closed?

3677~~~
Honestly you are the one who is exaggerating, top strikers miss occasions like that one every weeks. He missed so what ? I watch Lewandowski every week and he misses chances at every games.
And since Falcao isn't a poacher what is really important is that in the build up he is probably our best striker without being fit or in rythm.

3678~~~
Yes strikers miss sitters. I haven't said any different. I'm saying it's nonsense to suggest he couldn't do better. I don't agree with your last statement at all. Rooney and Van Persie are both better at linking up than what I've seen of Falcao.

3679~~~
It was a sitter, simple. Strikers miss such chances, it happens. I think he's class and once he gets back to match fitness, he'll be fantastic again. However, the amount it's going to cost to sign him permanently is quite huge, especially considering his age.

3680~~~
No need to be concerned - it's not a loan with a compulsory purchase clause. If he doesn't do the business, we won't buy him.

3681~~~
You answered your questions in your opening sentence.

Impatient and demanding fans. If he scores next week all is well with them. If not he remains not good enough.

3682~~~
Has anyone else found his all round play better than expected so far BTW? I always had him down as a poacher but he's shown some silky skills not related to scoring in his short time here.

3683~~~
Yeh me. He looks really good technically and seems to have a great awareness. Looks a real team player to my mind.

I think he can propel us back to the top to be honest. Supremely talented <i>and</i> hard working.

3684~~~
Out of curiosity what made you think that ? You are not the only one who thought that and even Ballague described him like that when he is closer to a Lewandowski type of striker.

3685~~~
Why do people keep saying that we will have to pay £44 million to sign him permanently? Wasn't it widely reported when the deal was done that if we take up the option to sign him the £6 million loan fee will be deducted from the £44 million? £38 million ain't a bad price to pay for a world class striker who will still be in his 20's.

3686~~~
I thought this too. I guess it's just down to his excellent goalscoring record. Which is a bit dumb when you look at the two players in Spain who are breaking every record going!

3687~~~
Was impressive alright! hopefully he'll get more time tomorrow!

3688~~~
It's his unselfishness & intelligence/awareness that have impressed me. I fully expected such a big-money signing to feel so much pressure that he'd be shooting too frequently in order to get on the scoresheet...however, he always plays a teammate in (if it's the right thing to do at that time); Cantona-like.

3689~~~
I thought the same. I think it's because of stats in one of the articles about him when we signed him high-lighting how little get gets involved in the build-up. Can't remember which article exactly. Maybe something by Sid Lowe? That and his lack of assists.

Whatever, I've been really impressed and pleased by his link-up play in his cameos so far.

3690~~~
Question of the day. Will he start tonight or not? I think not considerings RvP's goal this weekend, unless Rooney is out for sure.

3691~~~
Definitely not. He's clearly nowhere near ready for a start.

3692~~~
I wish he would. Give him 60 minutes at least and hopefully get him on the scoresheet (with a by product also that a goal or two might shut some clowns here up ) RVP can rest his weary legs at the same time so it's a win/win.

3693~~~
Clearly nowhere near ready for a start seems a bit strong. He came on and did pretty well - for a short period of time admittedly, but its something. Not sure how you can extrapolate from that he's "nowhere near" ready. Nothing is clear when it comes to Falcao's injury. 

I reckon he'd be ready if the situation demanded it. Like, if Rooney was judged unfit to play. But if we have all the strikers to choose from its a long shot Id say. I hope he gets a half.

3694~~~
On what basis in he "clearly nowhere near" ready?

3695~~~
It's a little bit strong but he hadn't played in ages before the Hull game and, by all accounts, has only just returned to full training last week. Then there's this issue about him possibly not being fully match fit at any point this season. I think Van Gaal could start him in a crisis but would say there's no chance of him starting tonight, assuming Rooney and RvP are both fit.

3696~~~
Did we make a mistake putting an exact fee in the terms of the loan. Even if he scored 30 goals for us I highly doubt Monaco could demand more than 44 million for him. 
If he has a relatively quiet second half of the season and scores 10 goals, then surely we could have asked for the price to be more like 30 million?

3697~~~
I'm of the opinion that starting him, even if it is with the intention of taking him off at HT, would be more useful to both him and the team than bringing him on for the final 20 minutes. Especially if the final 20 minutes are spent seeing out a game that is for all intents and purposes already over.

Giving him the opportunity to play a decent stint whilst the team is in full attack mode will help get him past any rustiness issues a lot faster.

3698~~~
I'd personally prefer to see him start and maybe play a half/60 minutes rather than 20 minutes towards the end when the rest of the players are knackered.

Edit: What <a class="username" data-user="42549, @Rado_N" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/42549/">@Rado_N</a> said.

3699~~~
What makes me think he will start tonight is that van Gaal said yesterday "he needs match rhythm". You don't get match rhythm by playing 20 minutes. It usually takes an hour or more.

3700~~~
Decent shout.

3701~~~
Not sure I agree. The way we play we're more likely to create chances later on in the game, after we've tired them out with all the possession Van Gaal wants from his team. Purely from the likelihood of scoring, it makes more sense to give him the last 30 minutes than the first 30. 

That said, the main reason to never start a player who you don't think can last 90 minutes is the fact you're using up one of your substitutions before a ball has been kicked. A couple of injuries later and we're fecked. A crazy risk to take for an upside that's, at best, debatable.

On a side note, RvP has scored every time he's played Stoke in a United shirt (4 times). 11 goals in 10 games against them overall. And he's just got a monkey off his back with the screamer against Hull. Then we have Rooney in the middle of one of his hot streaks. If fit and available I just don't see Van Gaal dropping either of them. In fact, I'd say there's close to zero chance of that happening.

I guess he could drop Rooney back into midfield but that would mean dropping Hererra, Fellaini or Carrick and (for various different reasons) I think that would be a very bad idea.

3702~~~
I guess the advantage of starting him, rather than giving him the last 20 minutes, is you get more of a sense about exactly how far along he is. You never know, he might still be going strong after an hour. He might last 70 minutes. Or he might be spent after 30. Bringing him on for the last 20-30 mins of the game wont tell you that.

3703~~~
The using up a sub thing is a fair point, but I don't agree with the POV that he'd be more likely to score in the final 30. I have absolutely no stats to back this up, but watching the game at weekend it felt like by the time he got on the pitch we'd reduced our intent by about 60%.

If we brought him on for the final 30 minutes and it was still 0-0 then I'd agree with you, but I just think giving him the chance from the beginning would be better.

RvP did score a screamer, but if we're honest he was pretty poor aside from that and the headed effort. Not that that will likely matter, as he seems to be the first name on the team sheet, so you're probably right that he's nailed on to start.

3704~~~
That's also true.

3705~~~
Not sure a competitive game is the place to be assessing stamina. They'll have a good enough idea from bleep tests and the like anyway. They'll still need to learn about sharpness and how close he is to the pace of a PL fixture - which you can't really mimic in training - but don't need to start a game to do this.

3706~~~
I'd start him as well. Stoke at home should really be a game we are winning without any trouble, and even if we know he may need to be taken off at the hour mark, I think it will benefit the player more to play 60 minutes of meaningful football, than possibly playing 20 minutes of killing off the game as we did against Hull. By the time Falcao came on, the game was done, and it seemed clear we were just seeing it out sensibly. He had one good chance, but compare that to the first half when we were seeing a lot of possession in the opposing half which Falcao could have been a part of.

If we were playing a top side, then I'd be a bit more reserved, but it's Stoke at home. Start him, and give him more opportunity to get a goal. I think he's desperate to score and to build some momentum.

3707~~~
I actually don't know the stats about when we score the most goals but my gut feel is that they tend to occur more oftern towards the end of games. Was definitely the case with Fergie. Mind you, under Fergie we were famous for never taking our foot off the gas and really putting the boot in once the other team were beaten. Van Gaal seems a wee bit more willing to hold onto what we have so it's a fair point that if we have a comfortable lead the ball will spend a lot of time being passed round the back. Of course, we may not have a comfortable lead in the last half hour. In that scenario, bringing a fresh and hungry striker of Falcao's quality off the bench would be a great option!

It's a tricky one but I just don't see the sense in starting a striker with any doubts over his match fitness when we've got quality alternatives. Agree with you about RvP but he's held onto his place after much worse performances than the one against Hull so would be incredible if he ended up on the bench after such a cathartic goal.

Having said all that, Rooney might be injured. Which makes for a very straightforward decision.

3708~~~
I agree.  It ggoes against conventional wisdom, but at worst you'd probably get a half out of him.  And other than if we get unlucky with injuries, there's nothing worse about playing him for 45 minutes then somebody else for 45 minutes than bringing him on for 20 minutes.

I've always thought that half-time substituions are an under-used tactic generally. Presuming you make it to half time with no injuries, then if you have a swap in mind, it's the ideal time to make it in terms of getting the maximum fitness level out of both players.

3709~~~
I totally agree, and it was the same vs QPR. Sure, occasionally a game will turn into an exhibition match at the end and you rack up lots of goals, but more often than that the game goes flat once you're 3 goals up with 20 mins to go and it just rolls to a conclusion. To make a proper judgement about Falcao we need him playing during that period of greatest intensity, when the team are trying to make the breakthrough and all your A-teamers are playing at their top level.

3710~~~
I agree with this. From a motivation point of view it will also keep RVP on his toes, as he won't be a guaranteed starter.

3711~~~
weird artictle in the metro this morning:

"When Radamel Falcao signed on loan for United on September 1, his stock was high. One of the world's finest strikers, he was well on his way to joining an elite band of world-class netbusters including Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo..."

they seem to have forgotten the whole knee surgery thing completely.

3712~~~
This is all true and there's 25 league games left to make a judgement. If there's any doubt at all over his ability to last the full 90, though, is it worth the risk of starting a player who you don't trust to finish the game so you can start that judgement process one game sooner?

3713~~~
He's played 15 minutes football in about a month?

3714~~~
Nothing wrong with starting with a player you know will have to come off before the end of 90 minutes, it happens all the time. Best way to build fitness.

That's different to starting with a player carrying an injury where, if it goes, they'll be out for an extended period. In that case I wouldn't risk it.

3715~~~
There is a big difference between looking lively for 20 mins in a game that was effectively over and being ready to start so I think he should be on the bench for another couple of games and then he will hopefully be ready to start games over Christmas when we will need to rotate. 

Now that we finally have some momentum and RVP has hopefully got some confidence back I don’t see the logic in taking the risk of playing Falcao just to get him fit.

3716~~~
Time for him to show up with the busy fixture list coming up for the next couple months. If he can score some important goals, the decision to buy becomes easier. I don't think Van Gaal will take the gamble of playing van Persie 3 times in a week.

3717~~~
I think he could be in with a shout to start vs Southampton, but that depends on RvP's form today. If not then, then he'll probably start the week after. Today was always going to be too soon for a start.

3718~~~
Van Gaal's management of Falcao has been consistent with his demands that players recapture match rhythm before getting back into the team. He's had Herrera and Evans playing reserve football because he feels players need to be match fit to start. Falcao is not injured, you could see that on Saturday. However, he has not enough football to get sharp. Van Gaal is nursing him back into the side slowly but surely, and his faith in him is clear from the fact he hasn't forced him to get minutes in the U21s. He'll get his chance, our December fixture list is too packed for him not to.

3719~~~
I'd like to see both Van Persie and Falcao play a half tonight tbh. Both would be in decent condition for Southampton then and it give Van Gaal the best chance of judging which of the two looks to be in better shape and form.

3720~~~
It’s frustrating to see so little of him. He hasn’t even played 300 minutes for us so far, and it’s December. I really hope he becomes a vital part of the team in the upcoming months, I rate him highly.

I love this banner at the top of the page.

3721~~~
He's looked class whenever he's played. Looks like doing something purposeful and incisive everytime he gets the ball. Shame he's featured so little.

3722~~~
As happy as I am to see Wilson play, it's getting really frustrating not seeing Falcao start. Doubt he'll start vs Southampton either.

3723~~~
He'll start when he's fit enough

3724~~~
It's disappointing but it's obviously for his own good. No one wants to see him rushed back only to pick up another injury. We'll just have to be patient, but at least Wilson gets his chance in the meantime.

3725~~~
He is still Monaco's top goalscorer this season. Amazing!

3726~~~
Stage is set.

3727~~~
On ASAP plz for RVP.

3728~~~
He will be on sooner than later, he's been brought on as a bit of a luxury so far, but tonight we NEED him to put a good performance in and I think he will thrive on that.

3729~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that's crazy

3730~~~
I feel I should say something about Berbashite right now

3731~~~
He's joint top scorer.

3732~~~
Looking clumsy as feck today. Can see why Louis didn't fancy him for more minutes.

3733~~~
Looks incredibly rusty. Did well to win the free kick to see the game out. He's going to need games to get back to the level he should be at. He needs a start pretty sharpish.

3734~~~
Did more in his 10 minutes than Wilson did in the whole game going on that run and winning that free kick to end the game. 10/10!

3735~~~
Very poor performance.

3736~~~
Does he deserve to start when he has this elephant touch ?

3737~~~
Gave the ball away twice I think.

We need to start actually starting him. It's no use throwing him in when we're sitting back and defending a lead.

Falcao and Fletcher coming on seems to be our favourite substitutions this season.

3738~~~
ffs...

3739~~~
He needs minutes. Should've been on earlier IMO. Probably should play a reserve game if there's one this week.

3740~~~
Definitely. On that display he sure as hell shouldn't be starting for the first team anyway. 

And that's competing with a very ordinary Robin Van Persie.

3741~~~
Course he's rusty, he's barely been in the team. Can't expect him to come on for ten mins and deliver.

3742~~~
Are you serious?

3743~~~
Looked really rusty when he came on, but it's understandable considering the circumstances.

Needs some minutes under his belt other than the odd cameo here and there

3744~~~
His touch was very rusty. But let's be honest here, RVP is contributing not much more at the moment. Personally I'd of taken off RVP and left Wilson on with Falcao.

3745~~~
Played like a badly off-form Hernandez today.

3746~~~
Pretty frustrating but it looks like he's trying too much, which probably boils down to his own frustration. 

Needs more than 15 minute spells to get back to his game.

3747~~~
I am a fan of him but you really beat me well about fanboyism.

He shown today why LVG started Wilson ahead of him.Need to build his full fitness and sharpness.That will come soon.

3748~~~
Agreed.

And people moan that he isn't starting.

3749~~~
Still looks rusty and a bit out of touch.

Its gonna click soon and we will enjoy it

3750~~~
The 10/10 bit was sarcasm if you couldn't tell but what I said has truth to it. All Wilson did was run around a lot apart from his chance which he should have buried and wasted. And I'm not a fanboy of any player. I'm not that childish.

3751~~~
Doubt it. Probably just as relieved as the rest of us. The last couple of minutes were horrendous!

3752~~~
Looks like a player coming back from a long lay off. Unfortunately for him we have two tough matches coming up where we need everyone fit and firing.

3753~~~
feck me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3754~~~
Don't understand the criticism when he's played so little football of late. Of course his touch isn't going to be immaculate.

3755~~~
I'd rather see him start and do 60 than be a sub and get 15.

3756~~~
He's actually looked sort of heavy legged every time he's played this season, so I think it goes deeper than his recent inactivity. If only our reserves played more regularly...

3757~~~
Hate to say it, as I got swept along in the whole fanboy thing when he arrived....but, if you didn't know his name or reputation, you'd think he was one of that stable of £5-8m strikers Fergie insisted on buying. The Manucho, Diouf, Dong type...

I'm starting to struggle to see how he's ever going to get fit enough.
He isn't keeping Rooney or even an off kilter Van Persie out anytime soon.

although perhaps the calls for Wilson to start will ease down a bit now.

3758~~~
Him and Rooney should start v Soton. RvP needs a break.

3759~~~
At least we know why Wilson is starting ahead of him now. The commentator on my river said he's only played 90 mins once in the last 13 months <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

3760~~~
Didn't really do much and had one half chance off that Valencia cross. Did well to get us to safety by drawing the foul from that run at the end.

3761~~~
Hes not match fit, he needs minutes and consistency in the team.

He will get there, just be patient people...

3762~~~
How can people judge a player whos played 20 mins combined in the last two games, where we are sitting back trying to see out the game and not forgetting coming back from a injury? Give him a few starts and he will score goals. People always assume to fast. If he scores a hatrick next week he will be the greatest again, fickle!

3763~~~
He needs to start a game and get a run in before we all judge him

3764~~~
Looked really rusty and lost the ball many times. Showed some glimpses of his ability when he torched the defender towards the end and bought us some time.

3765~~~
Hope he does well for us but it seems he has a lot of work to do

3766~~~
No white text ?
I thought Wilson did ok and unlucky not to score.

3767~~~
He need to be fully fit first before he should ever start a game.Clearly not match fit tonight.

3768~~~
Didn't have the best of times after he came on but I would like to see him get a start. He seems to eager to prove something when he comes off the bench and tries too hard.

3769~~~
Looked a bit anxious when he came on, probably disappointed to be coming on so late. He did have that run right at the end that essentially saw the clock out that showed he has a burst in his legs and that upper body strength to protect the ball.

I get that LvG is taking a slow approach with him but I think he needs some proper game time to get competitively sharp, I'd give him the start vs Southampton and then see how he is at the 60 minute mark.

3770~~~
Not sure that kind of run out is going to help his "match rhythm" much. By the time he came on we were virtually playing on the counter attack. Should've come on a lot earlier, and probably for RVP. But I can see why Louis rationalised Robin's hold up play being of more use in the later stages than Wilson's pace.  Personally I'd have rather gone for a 3rd, but that's me.

3771~~~
Brought on 10 mins too late. The game went stretched and lvg dallied, by the time he got on the field it was far too tight.

3772~~~
Wilson suddenly came alive when Falcao was warming up, and he was getting very dangerous with his pace, so not a problem that Falcao came on late. Next game Falcao will be ready for 60 minutes, hope he gets them.

3773~~~
not enough time. 15 minutes or so? pointless. he should have come on at the 60th minute mark.

3774~~~
He has a very strange running style.

3775~~~
Seems pretty erratic on the ball. He's obviously not fully fit, though. Once he gains full fitness, I have no doubt he'll look a lot sharper and start banging in some goals.

3776~~~
I swear the last 20 pages and few months of this thread have been the same lines repeated over and over <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

'Once he finds form he will be banging them in for fun' ( in fact I think the phrase<b> 'Banging in'</b> or '<b>Banging them in'</b> is probably the most used in this thread)

'Its understandable given how much time hes played'

'this bit of play where he <insert very mundane thing every player does here> was amazing'

'Hold up play was excellent'

'How can you judge him on x amount of minutes'

'Poor touch'

'He has to start over RVP.'

Never have I seen a players every movement and attributes analysed so much, ever. He is never going to be the player you wanted until he is 100% fit, in that sense I feel LVG should rest him and play him in reserve matches until he is fit enough to start games, to stop this 20 minutes here 10 minutes there where you cant actually judge how well hes doing.

Then again theres always the chance he was bought with the intention of just being an impact sub, like Hernandez and not a main striker.

3777~~~
He was shit when he came on, but he only played a few minutes, he needs match fitness. Hopefully he will start up front with RvP with Southampton.

3778~~~
Its hilarious. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The phrase clutching at straws comes to mind. In all honesty, he's done naff all in 4 months, is clearly not fit, and yet people moan and moan that he doesn't start. If his name wasn't Falcao, he'd be getting destroyed.

3779~~~
The man hasn't played consistent football for an entire year, for crying out loud. Give him some time to get himself going.

3780~~~
You have to be a bit of a spaz to be "destroying" him for getting niggly injuries. But this is an internet forum I suppose where such a breed of person thrives

3781~~~
He could do with a run of games. Why doesn't he start? Seems like a massive waste of cash if we're not prepared to start him.

3782~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> it's true.

The whole thing has just been a huge disappointment so far, but I do believe things will look up in the 2nd half of the season. It just hasn't gone his way at all.

3783~~~
Its like people feel the need to  be justifying something that doesnt need justifying.  No one really can say it will have been a bad bit of business if it doesnt work out since it was only a loan deal anyway its not as if he has a huge price tag to deal with.

3784~~~
He needs a run of games.

3785~~~
RvP can't play every game, Wilson hasn't shown that he's a starter yet and LvG wants to play with two strikers. So, yeah, Falcao needs to get fit and play, as there's no alternative.  I suspect he'll get a start against S'hmptn, and barring injury, will get playing time over the Christmas fixtures.

3786~~~
I'm just not overly concerned because he's not our player.

3787~~~
In fairness, I genuinely feel as though he has performed better than Van Persie when he has been on the pitch. Given that the times he's been on the pitch have been 10-30 minute appearances in the second half, it's frustrating that he isn't playing more. Obviously that is down to his fitness, but I don't blame people for getting excited when he does something good. He was genuinely one of the 5-10 best in the world a few years ago, we're always going to get excited when he does something good and will him to start performing.

3788~~~
Not yet anyway...

3789~~~
He won't be either, based on the evidence so far...

3790~~~
Agree. He must be worried because if he doesn't get fit and impress there is no way he will be joining us. Also, other big clubs will be watching him and they won't take a chance on him either. Not sure where that would leave him.

3791~~~
Needs a game or two in the reserves to get some match fitness - like the way Evans has.

3792~~~
Monaco?

3793~~~
First game he hasn't looked particularly dangerous. That said he got about 15 minutes when we were largely sitting back, not under the cosh but we were in seeing the game out mode. 

Edit: Valuable minutes for him, another run out. Bring on the next game and more minutes for him.

3794~~~
He looked good in his previous cameos. Had a shocker tonight though.

3795~~~
Yep. We saw Keane playing yesterday and then on the bench today. Not sure why Falcao couldn't have got some minutes against Southampton under 21s. Even if it's just to get back in the scoring routine. I felt he should have come on for Robin but he's got a good week to train and hopefully he will feature against Southampton.

3796~~~
Hasn't their owner had a divorce and got financial issues? Plus with FFP issues too. I assumed they are trying to offload him because of his wage issues. They obviously would take him back because of his contract but not sure they would be happy about it.

3797~~~
He'll get there, just needs to get back to 100% fitness. Remember it takes 'normal' people usually a full year just to get back to playing recreational sports after ACL surgery usually. I have faith that he'll prove his worth, though little sub appearances in the situations he's come on really can't tell you much at all. Hopefully he starts ahead of RvP in the next game, alongside Rooney. Think they could be a very good partnership.

3798~~~
Then he won't stay, you don't purchase a Ferrari to then leave it in the garage to gather dust. As much as I love Hernandez if LVG is thinking he can use Falcao that way then he needs his head tested. Even in Monaco Falcao scored goals.

3799~~~
I agree. I don't see how 10 minutes here and there when we're either comfortable or holding on in "counter then hide in the corner" mode can be of much benefit. He needs to actually <b>be</b> in a game.

Ignoring their obvious financial issues, his effusive "it's great to finally be at a proper club at last" speil had decent potential to be a bridge burner. It was certainly quite an odd thing to say after a loan move. They're still a small enough club for it not to matter, but it certainly didn't seem like the talk of a guy who thought he'd be going back.

3800~~~
Brought on a bit late but I guess that was down to our 2nd goal timing. Hopefully he will start vs Soton.

3801~~~
Poor Falcao just seems to be trying too hard at the moment on the pitch. He really seems desperate to make an impression

3802~~~
It's obvious that he needs consistent game time considering how long he's been out/away from regular football. 

The guy is world class, he just needs regular minutes to get into his flow. People on here are being ridiculously over-critical given the circumstances.

3803~~~
Was the ideal game to give him the start and build up his match fitness. As it is, I wouldn't trust him against Southampton with the way he's. Would rather we go with Wilson again if Rooney is still injured.

3804~~~
I don't know where Rob got this idea of him being brought in to be used as an impact sub, absolutely nothing in Falcao's career suggests he's this type of player and Van Gaal isn't an idiot. But then again it's pretty obvious from Rob's messages in here he's desperate for Falcao to fail so I take all his messages with a pinch of salt.
Falcao never really wanted to go there and was a 'victim' of this third party ownership thingy. It was pretty evident when he signed there, though of course living in a bling bling city with wads of cash must have helped to soften the blow for that year. Even though, I don't think he's the type of player who would enjoy playing in front of 7000 players each week and I think his enthusiasm of being here is sincere.

3805~~~
Will make his mark against Liverpool, I have no doubts.

3806~~~
What do you guys think? Will he start against Southhampton or Liverpool?

3807~~~
Doesn't look like this one is going to work out. 3 months into his career here and he hasn't shown enough to warrant the £40m+ fee that Monaco would demand.

Really hope he proves me wrong and shows form of a few seasons ago, he will certainly get more game time over the Xmas period

3808~~~
He needs to be starting games. 10 Minute cameo's are not enough to show your full ability.

3809~~~
You don't start games when you're not fully fit.He will be a scapegoat for a lot of fans here if he starts game and put it shit performance due to lack of fitness.Patience is needed.

3810~~~
Agreed but there was context to the last cameo, he was always unlikely to start and an appearance of less than 20 minutes in hindsight was on the cards given a similar turn out on the weekend. Given how the games were so close and we're edging him closer to fitness, not desperately chucking him in, that was the expected scenario. A few rest days ahead now and it's easy to foresee a 60 minute start against Saints or Scouse if LVG needs it and Rooney news is grim.

3811~~~
Must start games. Impossible for us to properly assess him otherwise. Radamel Falcao is not a substitute. Let him play games, full games, and then - if he fails then it can be said that he fails. Bringing on a world-class centre-forward for 15 minutes in scenarios where the team is in 'take the ball into the corner flag' mode is pointless.

3812~~~
If Rooney is out for Southampton game (I havent heard an update) then I think Falcao may start! And rightly so, Wilson hasnt quite stamped his name into a starting role as yet, although I thought he was good yesterday, shame he didnt score or just roll in RVP to score (but strikers should be selfish and was a good run). But we want to see Falcao in the big games and potentially being our striker in the future therefore he needs to start the games now. He must have had 3 weeks full training under his belt now.

3813~~~
I am not saying he deserves too, but I am replying to people who are saying "it's not working out, he is passed his best". Coming on in a fast tempo game, on a cold night is not easy to get up to speed in 10 minutes. You will probably find he has never really been a sub before, it's a completely different feeling coming into a game where everybody is flying around at 110%. 

He has had a few minutes now to get a little sharpness back, so starting him will be fine for Southampton IMO.

3814~~~
Seriously doubt it. He just looks miles off the pace.

As I said last night he's had that heavy legged, slightly clumsy look about him throughout this season, so his issues run deeper than ring-rust from the recent injury. Really struck me when he came off the bench against West Brom. He played like he was running through treacle, constantly struggling to stay upright.

Not sure what's going on to be honest but he looks woefully under-cooked right now. If he's going to start any game soon it should be for our U-21s (which VG alluded to in a recent interview)

3815~~~
He hasn't had the chance to show much though has he. He needs to start some games then we can make a judgement surely.

3816~~~
Before these last two games he looked sharp, held up the ball well, quick, good touch and contributed well. 

So it doesn't really fit with the narrative that he's broken after that injury.

3817~~~
He should start against Southampton. Wilson did a decent job but we need more experience for that game. Wouldnt mind Rooney and him starting with RvP badly out of form

3818~~~
He has started a few games and come of the bench in some too. And I just don't see a £40m striker in there at all. Seems to be lacking the quality in his touch and finishing which is what made him so good at Madrid/Porto.

As I say I'm desperate for him to succeed but we are 3 months into the season and he hasn't looked fit/sharp yet.

3819~~~
I'm not saying he's broken after injury. I don't know what's going on to be honest. He's shown glimpses of class this season, I agree. He's a top class striker and is always capable of doing something classy. However, I'm struggling to reconcile the heavy-legged, slightly clumsy player he's often looked like this season with the lethal predator he used to be in Spain. Maybe he just needs to start a run of games to find his mojo? Would feel much happier about giving him that chance if he didn't look so hapless coming off the bench.

3820~~~
That's true with most players with a reputation though. Because they've built that reputation for a reason and therefore people will probably show more patience to them than a random player coming in as they've seen what they can do in the past. He's got a great record so people having confidence he will score is hardly a ridiculous claim to suggest he will do well, nothing wrong with being positive.

3821~~~
You've got to consider how many minutes he's played. Think about what Rooney is like if he misses a week. 

There's very few strikers who impact off the bench and they usually all have pace. 

I'll start to judge him once he's had his minutes, I think they would have come in the U21s but the games are too thick and fast for that luxury now. When he's got some serious minutes under his belt and he still looks half the player then I will start to judge him. If we are in March and he still hasn't got those minutes, I'll start writing him off as a crock.

3822~~~
I'm getting frustrated with him being brought on for 10 minute cameos, I'm sure he is too.

If he's fit then he should be starting, simple as that. Its not like our other strikers are firing on all cylinders.

3823~~~
Nowhere near as inept as Falcao last night.

In fact, on the very rare occasion that Rooney comes off the bench after a spell out injured he usually makes an immediate impact. The next time he <i>starts</i> a game he does often look a bit flat but, as far as strikers are concerned, it doesn't get much easier than playing the closing stages when the game has opened out and the opposition are tiring.

3824~~~
Fans just dont have any patience at all, do they? Let's give him a good run out when he's fully fit and then we can judge him

3825~~~
What about the closing stages where your team has retreated into its own third and you have no support?

It's one of those discussions where we could reword what we are saying 20 times and still not convince each other.

My opinion is that he's a very special player who is worth rehabilitating, because that's what is happening, I'm under no illusion that he's just coming back from any old injury. It's a long process where he will need the club and fans to give him time to get back to his best.

But as I said, I have faith in him coming good.

3826~~~
We're on the same page then.

My only worry is the timeframe and structure of his deal. If we'd signed him permanently I'd be extremely confident we'd see him back to his very best in 2015/16, with a full pre-season under his belt. It's the same with most new signings, the second season is where you'll see them at their best. Something which is even more likely in someone who had a serious injury relatively recently. Unfortunately, he doesn't have that luxury and the pressure is on.

3827~~~
Without going into 'conspiracy theories' or anything, I'm pretty sure deep down we've actually bought him in the sense the deal was structured as a one year loan with an option to buy but all parties involved know it's bullshit to arrange Monaco with FFP. Those kind of deals are going to get more and more common to circumvent FFP (I have a friend who works in a law firm often used by one of the big European clubs who told me it was their initial response to FFP).

3828~~~
Yeah, it does seem as though that's possible. Was certainly the rumour doing the rounds in the summer.

In which case, no drama. He can continue as a bit-part player and really show us what he's got next season.

3829~~~
Well according to a lot of journalists, we've basically done the deal but Monaco wanted it delayed by a loan in order to cook their books. They had the James money go through their accounts this year and the Falcao money will be next year. In terms of the FFP it's better to spread it as if it all went through the accounts this summer just gone, it wouldn't count in 5 years, this way they get breathing space.

Most people's issues is that we're stumping up £50m for a has been. 

Personally I don't think that matters, I think Woodward knows how good a name like Falcao is for the status of the club and he's probably done his figures. He's not going to let the team suffer either. If there is still doubts about whether he's up to it and we've already committed to taking him on, I think we're more likely to move Van Persie on and bring someone else in and have Rooney, Wilson, Falcao and +One. 

All in all, I'm really not worried about our future <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> it's not like we're Liverpool and just spunked £120m on shite and can't afford to remedy it.

3830~~~
I concur. All his talk about being happy here, staying here, the #9 jersey, all that stuff, to me it's done and dusted as well just like Chicharito's move to RM.

3831~~~
I'd say there's a fair chance he's been Shevchenko'd. Hope not.

3832~~~
Haven't Real said they won't be signing Chicha on a permanent deal though?

3833~~~
Oh, wasn't aware to be fair.

That only backs up my point though, right? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3834~~~
LVG will be the one who decide whether he's fit enough but I have no doubt he will start if he's fully fit.If Rooney not coming back on time I can see LVG goes for Wilson-Falcao vs Southampton. (I'm not writing off RVP here before any of his fan jumping the gun, just stating what I think will happen)

3835~~~
I'm not sure actually, I think I read it somewhere and your post made me remember... but I'm not 100% sure.

3836~~~
I was surprised he didnt come on a bit earlier than he did, he was warming up around the hour mark but it just didnt happen. I would have thought he would have wanted to give him at least half an hour if there was any possibility of him starting against Southampton. So I assume itll be another cameo for him, at least Rooney should be fit and rested.

3837~~~
I desperately want him to come good for United as I am sure we all are.  I am worried that he is not happy with not being started over a poor form RvP and Wilson.  I know he hasn't been fit but it looks like he is ready to go.  I hope he gets a start soon.

3838~~~
You're right, he was about to come on at 60 minutes but then we scored so van Gaal changed his mind. What this shows is that Falcao is still a long way from full fitness so he won't start any games soon. He will probably play for the reserves at some point and once he completes 60 minutes he'll be considered to start for the first team.

3839~~~
I hope not as well because then we'd have two Shevchenko'd strikers.

3840~~~
Hilarious that people are judging him on 10 and 15 min cameos.

3841~~~
Agree. The funny thing is he's still created chances even in the cameo's....let's see after he's started games about his contribution. I'm prepared to give him time cause these type of players rarely become available....

3842~~~
It's those cameos which are supposed to force a player into the starting line-up. Coming off the bench and making a real impact, so the manager has no option but to put that player in his best XI. That's how Hernandez became a first team regular at the business end of his debut season. It's not unreasonable to expect a player with a pedigree as impressive as Falcao to make a similar impression, despite not starting games.

3843~~~
Agreed

I dont even rate Falcao that highly, but against Hull for example, the game was already virtually over by the time he came on and whilst Falcao was trying to make an impact, the rest of the team were coasting at that point.

He deserves a start ahead of RVP and a good 60 minutes to show what he can do. Even if he cant play the full 90 it will give him an opportunity.
 With Rooney out I imagine he may start vs Southampton. I suspect if Di Maria was fit we would play 4-3-3 with one up front, but without ADM we dont really have the wide options and will stick with the diamond or 3-5-2.

3844~~~
Jaysus, if that's him trying to make an impact...

3845~~~
Should start vs the Saints if Rooney's not healthy

3846~~~
What is he expected to do in the last 15 mins when we are defending a lead and have Darren Fletcher in midfield to create absolutely nothing? Hernandez is a sub, a very good one who is usually better as a sub than a starter, whereas absolutely world class players like Falcao are usually not good as subs, at least not for 15 mins when he has hardly played at all in the last year. At least give him 30 mins to get into the game. 

Players like Mata and Herrera usually need the first 15 to 20 mins in games or even a full half to improve, but of course Falcao should do all in the last 15 mins.

3847~~~
If you are against a player, you are against him and won't give up, right? First it was Kagawa, then Mata, then RvP, then Herrera and now Falcao. DDG is also on your list often enough. Di Maria will probably be next ...

3848~~~
I thought in the Hull game he looked lively when he came on. Yes he missed the big chance that came his way, but as I said, the rest of the team looked like they were coasting at that point.

I was against the Falcao signing in the first place and thought we should have kept Welbeck (and still do, to an extent) but there is no point bringing in Falcao and then expecting him to do great things with 10 minute sub appearances. Some strikers are good as impact subs, some arent. I remember in Fergie's book he spoke about Solskjaer in this respect - OGS could sit on a bench for 80 minutes but he wouldnt be snoozing, he would be studying the opposition defenders, noting their strengths and weaknesses so that when he came on, he could exploit them. This is why he was such a great impact sub.

Some strikers (I would say most strikers) simply dont have that capability, and are much better performers when they play from the start of the game. I think Falcao falls into this category.

3849~~~
Shocking the way I criticise footballers that don't play well (and praise them when they do) on a website dedicated to talking about football, isnt it? Has the world gone mad?

3850~~~
You just made that up, didn't you?

Don't suppose you have some examples to back it up?

You might also want to take a moment to think about Aguero's substitute appearances for City...

3851~~~
We saw last night why he isn't starting, looked well off the pace and pretty rusty, there is no way he can start against a Southampton and he probably needs a game or two in the reserves. We need to keep momentum and need the points so he should probably remain 4th choice until he is fitter.

3852~~~
Well usually world class players are starters so there are not many examples, but I remember both Rooney and Tevez not performing as well for us when they had some sub appearances compared to their starting performances.

And as I said Herrera and Mata (while not absolutely world class) also usually need some mins to get into their rythm, whereas Chicharito or Ole could come in and score within minutes.

3853~~~
It's different for Falcao and Hernandez. Hernandez wasn't proven world class. Falcao is proven world class and we paid a shit ton to loan him and will have to pay 40 mil or whatever to sign. You gotta at least give him a start once he's fit, his reputation has warranted him that chance at the very least.

You don't sign a proven world class striker and make him an impact sub. He'll start cause wilson is not ahead of him in the pecking order so clearly Falcao isn't match fit yet. He'll start soon enough and prove his class.

3854~~~
Nope, but shocking you never criticise some footballers, and shocking how you keep criticising the same footballers again and agsin and trying to find something negative to say about them all the time a la Roy Keane.

3855~~~
Not true at all. They often had a big impact coming off the bench. It's how Tevez forced his way into the first XI towards the end of his final season with us.

Aguero's someone else who is world class and devastating off the bench.

3856~~~
To be fair to you, it does seem like quite an arsey comment. Probably some leftover fallout from the Welbeck sale methinks...

3857~~~
I do agree he'll be starting soon enough. The only point I'm making is that his poor performance last night can't be put down to the length of his cameo. Much more likely to be down to him playing so little football recently. Hence I'd have reservations about starting him next Monday. Would prefer to start him after a sub appearance where he looks way sharper than he did against Stoke.

3858~~~
I remember it differently with Tevez and Rooney, both usually needed time to get into the game in order to be at their best.

As with Aguero the WC and a couple of games last season in the PL (The late Liverpool game comes into mind) have shown that he is not nearly as good as a sub as he usually is when he starts. Of course this doesn't mean he turns into a pub player as a sub.

3859~~~
? We were both against the Welbeck sale so I am absolutely sure Welbeck has nothing to do with this.
Edit: Or I misunderstood your post and you didn't mean leftover fallout from the Welbeck sales from me.

3860~~~
Have you considered that maybe he is not world class anymore, and/or had a career changing injury?

3861~~~
Hope he gets a start against Southampton. He's looked really up for it whenever he's played and I think he'll be desperate to score against them. Didn't have a great cameo against Stoke but any player can have a bad 15 minute spell.

3862~~~
You're like a dog with a bone <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I really hope he gets fit and starts firing just to see you eat your words <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3863~~~
I dont need to eat anything <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>. I suggested from the start that he would be a great option if it was only a loan deal but that he may not be the Falcao we saw  at Atletico for a number of reasons, so he would have to have a phenomenal second half of the season to change that. 

People got far too cocky  back then, its  only fair we call it for what it has been so far.

3864~~~
People still calling for him to start against Southampton <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Is everyone just completely ignoring what they're seeing in front of their eyes and saying he should start because he's called Falcao? I geninly don't get it.

3865~~~
It's not exactly a laughable notion. His movement looks lively and his finishing is just as good as Van Persie's. Between Falcao, Van Persie and Wilson I'd go for Falcao if Van Gaal thinks he's fit enough.

3866~~~
Which he clearly doesn't.

3867~~~
Yes but you see interestingly enough players get fitter with time and training so he might be fit enough by the weekend.

3868~~~
He's played two 15 minute cameo's in the last month. He won't be fit enough by the weekend.

3869~~~
I hope he comes good but he's beginning to look like the gamble may not have been a wise one. The renties got Costa for £32million, which is looking like the bargain of the season.

3870~~~
It's the fact that his movement looks good and so does his hold up play. He isn't going to forget how to finish either. He will score goals.

3871~~~
Oh I didn't know you were a doctor who knows that his injury has been career changing.
Maybe you give him a bit of time (which everyone needs after that kind of injury) before deciding if it has been career changing or not and if he is world class anymore or not.

3872~~~
it's only just December and you're already writing him off? plenty of time left for him to prove himself, which I'm sure he will.

3873~~~
These are the sort of posts that used to come and bite you in the arse. Njred and Dumbstar are pros.

3874~~~
Give the man a break for Eric's sake.

He's come to the hardest league in the world after a very serious injury. He took a few games to get accustomed to the PL but he's already shown excellent movement and had some flashes of brilliance (e.g. volley against Leicester). He then got his first and the winning goal against Everton which was a massive goal in our season - the turning point you could say. Now he's picked up a couple of small, unrelated, injuries and has had a few cameo appearances since where he could even have had a goal vs Hull but for a great block.

You only have to watch his interview before the QPR game to see what a genuine guy he is and the respect he has for our club. You can also tell he is trying his heart out when he is on the pitch. So yeah, again, give the guy a break.

3875~~~
Thank you for showing some patience and for not reaching for conclusions already. Reading the posts in this thread, it has been very surprising to me to see how some people have been so critical of him. Maybe people had unreasonably high expectations when we signed him, but his start so far really shouldn't be too surprising. He was already recovering from an awful injury when he got here, and like you said, this is not the ideal league to come to, for someone with an injury like that. He has yet to gain full fitness, and the calf injuries that he picked up didn't help. He clearly looks rusty (especially with his finishing), but his all around game for the most part has been very solid, and in cases like these, rust goes away with a consistent run of games. He hasn't had that yet.

It's different if Falcao's season here fails because of his injuries and consequently missing games. But I'll be very surprised if his season fails because of his actual play, even though he stayed fit. I don't know why some people have already come to the conclusion that he isn't good enough anymore, and that the move has already failed. We have a long way to go in this season.

3876~~~
He's done nothing that warrants him starting ahead of any of our strikers, Wilson included. If Rooney is injured, Wilson should keep his place in the team.

3877~~~
All our experienced strikers have already peaked. Falcao, RVP and Rooney had their best seasons 2-3 years ago. They are still capable of some world class performances (think of RVP against Spain, he was stunning in that game) but they do not come often enough. In short, they are not world class any more. Falcao struggled to impress in France already before the injury. Rooney was world class in 2011. Since then he's been too inconsistent to call him world class, albeit he's still very good. (If you want to know what it is to be a world class striker, look at Aguero, that will suffice.)

We will need to sign a world class striker in the next summer window if we want to regain our position as one of the top top teams in Europe. Hopefully, Wilson will develop quicky and will surpass our expectations.

3878~~~
People in here need to relax. Last year we all wanted Fellaini out, now he looks like the beast he was at Everton.

Falcao has barley played for a whole year. Of course his fitness/form isnt up to scratch. Also he hasnt really had time to adapt to the league either.

Unless he turns out to be a croock, im confident he will turn things around eventually. 

Im also confident LvG is doing the right thing. Hes not leaving a world class striker on the bench because its fun. He just came back from injury and needs to be esased into it. Better to be cautious than too risk him getting sidelined again

3879~~~
You couldn't be more wrong lumping Rooney in the same category as the other two. He's the same age now as Van Persie was when he was at his peak. You're relentlessly biased against him, mind you, so that's no great surprise.

3880~~~
You're are relentlessly biased about Rooney, so that reply is no great surprise.

It's stipid to refer to RvP's age, for players may peak quite differently, there are countless examples about players who were better at 22 or 24 than at 29. When was the last time when Rooney was world class over the course of a whole season?

3881~~~
Rooney is looking excellent this season, and his style has slightly changed. There's no reason he won't maintain this type of level for a few years.

3882~~~
Seeing as nobody can even agree on the definition of world class, I'm fecked if I'm going to get into a debate about exactly when he hit this mythical level of performance for an entire season.

What I will say (repeat, in fact) is that it's fecking stupid to lump him in the same category as RvP. One of them has been a shadow of his usual self for over 18 months. The other has been arguably our best player, for the vast majority of that same period of time.

Falcao is, at least, the same age and it's far too early to know whether or not he's in decline, so it's not quite so outright daft to group them together but Falcao still has it all to prove he can get back to his best, whereas Rooney's performances leave no doubt that he's very close to it right now.

3883~~~
The meaning of 'world class' may be vague but it is clear that Rooney has not been one of the top 5 or even 10 forwards in world football over the last 2 seasons. He was a top top forward some years ago, not any more. Back then he was in the discussion about the best players in the world. Not any more. Actually, RVP and Falcao had great seasons as <i>strikers </i>more recently than Rooney.

It's fecking stupid to deny that Rooney's status as a <i>striker</i> has declined since 2011. That's fecking stupid, Pogue. No one would mention him as one of the top 5 strikers in the world over the last 2-3 seasons, except for some of his fanboys, I guess. He has clearly declined. He is still a very good player and is currently more useful than the other two. But I'm talking about him as a <i>striker. </i>Even LVG indicated that he tried him as a striker and wasn't satisfied with his perfomances as a striker.

He will retire as a legend, no doubt about that. But let's not be blind about his decline. He <i>was </i>one of the top 5, maybe even top 3 strikers in the world several years ago. That's not true any more. He would make top 15 only on reputation.

3884~~~
You're talking up his peak and talking down his current status to fit your narrative. He's always been a tier below the very best in the world, which is where he sits now. One of the very best strikers around but not quite up there with the goal per game freaks like Aguero, Messi, Ronaldo and (while he was at Liverpool) Suarez.

I've no doubt he could get similar numbers to his most prolific season for United if he played a whole season as a number 9 but right now he's a victim of a combination of his own versatility, an unbalanced squad and a manager who seems incredibly reluctant to drop the captain of a national team that he steered to a WC semi-final.

You've been desperate to write him off for years but his performances so far this season (not to mention his goal or assist/game average in a car-crash of a season in 2013/14) are those of a player who is either at - or very close to - his peak right now. It's simply absurd to lump him alongside Van Persie as two strikers who both peaked 2 or 3 years ago.

3885~~~
OK. I'm not talking him up. He was a tier below Ronaldo and Messi but not a tier below other forwards. Recently, he hasn't been in that second tier of forwards. I do not think that he is close to his peak from season 09/10 and 2011. I have watched him enough, you know. Well, I may be wrong. I'm not a football expert. But Scholes said pretty much the same and he knows Rooney's ups and downs quite better than us, I guess. He could be wrong as well. Time will show etc. 

I'm lumping RVP and Rooney together in the sense that both have peaked. But this does not imply that they have played at the same level recently. Rooney plays better in his role than RVP as a striker. BTW, if I'm not mistaken, RVP's stats from last season weren't bad if you consider them in terms of contributed golas per game. They do not correspond to the dramatic picture that you present. Stats wise, Mata has been quite good as well but we know that he hasn't been very good for United.

3886~~~
Let's revisit this at the end of the season. I think it will be abundantly clear by then who has peaked and who has not.

3887~~~
Keep the Rooney talk to the Rooney thread, or make a new one.

3888~~~
Not writing him off at all. We all know what a fit Falcao can do. What I'm saying is we're paying a lot of money for a player who isn't fit and whose game time has been markedly limited by injury problems. We knew this before we signed him. I just think the money might have been more wisely spent.

3889~~~
We're also paying 60k for a player who hasnt played once this season and another player who is playing for another TEAM! So money is obviously irrelevant here. Falcao is the perfect buy for united simple fact for the statement that United can still attract top players and ofc will be a vital player once he is fully fit and has some game time under his belt. So i believe he will make up for the money united is paying him, just have to be patient and the goals will come.

3890~~~
I hate to see him only get a few minutes when we are in "control" and don't need to score. He needs to start a match or at least get in on the action in the second half. He will be immense for us.

3891~~~
Meanwhile, we'll have to rely on the midfielders and an out-of-sorts Van Persie.

3892~~~
His intelligence and communication with in his 20 minute cameos recently, really have been of high order, when he replaced Wilson V Stoke there was an understanding instantly and a spacial awareness from Falcao that Wilson just didn't express. His 20 minutes against Hull he created a chance and then also created one for himself with a quick turn, he was insanely close to scoring too.
He simply isn't miles off the pace, he's not exactly on it either but his awareness shows an intelligence up there with Van Persie, his movement and his hold up play is going to be something special.
This running through treacle business holds no water whatsoever, his turn and pass then then follow up run to back up Mata showed excellent pace and his positioning to receive the pass was smart.
Tell you what though Pogue if you really want to see a bloke that looks like he's running through treacle look no further than Mata, Ive never seen such a small guy look like he's carrying such a huge weight on his back, totally understandable why Mourinho didn't fancy him.

3893~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11278728/Louis-van-Gaal-puts-Radamel-Falcaos-Manchester-United-future-in-doubt-as-fitness-concerns-linger.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...ture-in-doubt-as-fitness-concerns-linger.html</a>

Van Gaal saying he's not going to start tomorrow, which is hardly a surprise. Looks like he's getting a bit arsey about his fitness, not sure why he's surprised given we took a punt on a player who'd just returned from such a serious injury.

3894~~~
Was this the embargoed section of the press conference?

3895~~~
So Falcao will play with the reserve ?

3896~~~
Maybe he's not happy Falcaos played in no reserve games but neither did Rojo. Just start him for the love of God.

3897~~~
He wanted him to play in the reserves but couldn't as we needed him on Tuesday on the bench. 

It doesn't sound like he's getting annoyed to me tbh, it's just LVG stamping his authority and letting the media know he's in charge.

3898~~~
Its getting over dramatized by a certain journo who Falcao recently called a speculating fool on Twitter.

3899~~~
Just wanted to say that. Media making stuff up, out of nothing. He only said he wanted him to play for the reserves, nothing more.... Media going for clicks shock.

3900~~~
Apparently the players have to pass a test with the fitness coach, Rojo passed it easily and the others failed, so they had to play with the reserve. And it seems that Falcao failed too but Rooney injury didn't allowed Falcao to play with the reserve.

3901~~~
What LVG says just goes in one ear, and out the other with some people, doesn't it?

3902~~~
It's typical to be honest, have to sell newspapers I guess. 

Some people will lap it up though.

3903~~~
That's probably more likely in fairness, he seemed a bit grumpy in general on Friday and those quotes are maybe more indicative of him being short with the press than an issue with Falcao's fitness.

3904~~~
Exactly how they wanted them to..

3905~~~
Wonder if it will ever kickstart. With Falcao and van Persie both not looking up to it, there will need to actually be some serious thought for a striker - someone at a younger age with a bit of dynamism and goalscoring about them. I quite like the look of the young Spaniard; Alcacer, but I think he's still too green for the move up at the minute. Either one of the two we have buck up their ideas, or we simply rely on Rooney to carry us through. There's actually some cause for concern here.

3906~~~
Yeah, the press were ticking him off on Friday. Think he's frustrated with their shit questions, just like we are.

3907~~~
There should be no cause for concern in December and the way our season has gone so far. It's not like we're Liverpool who can't score for toffee. 

Let's see how the season plays out and reassess come May.

3908~~~
Bottom line, another 2-3 weeks before he can be considered for a first XI spot?  That's around Christmas-Will be nice for him to be available and match fit for those fixturee. Disappointed that's he'll have been out for two months because of his calf injury though.

3909~~~
I think we massively miss an 'established' striker with genuine pace. Wilson showed it against Stoke, but he's a good few years away from being a regular starter.

If neither RVP or Falcao find their form by the end of the season, I'd be quite supportive of a proper reshuffle up top.

3910~~~
Granted, although conversely, it isn't as though we are the free-scoring force many (including fans) expected. We are still looking a bit lost for ideas and erratic in our finishing, so it isn't as though that area couldn't be improved. 
Yeah, I don't want to drag in a constant debate on here regarding a certain someone but I do agree in that sense. I agree with your last point too, some may argue it is a little early to raise this point, but we'll see.

3911~~~
A few months ago we had possibly the best strike force in World football, now it needs a rethink.

Good grief...

3912~~~
This is where I stand. Sadly, I don't think there are many alternatives kicking around. If he were to ever become a victim of the Madrid merry-go-round, I think Karim Benzema would be the kind of striker we should be taking a serious look at. He's very 'United' in his play style, for want of a better description. Fast, direct and full of energy. His finishing can be questionable but his goal record is certainly impressive. Other than that, I'm a bit stuck. I think Cavani is largely shite, for example.

3913~~~
Well we didn't.

3914~~~
I don't know if that's a condescending tone you're taking but yes, that is how football can work. 
When one of those 'best strike forces' has barely played more than 90 minutes once, and the other has 4 goals in 14 appearances, you do start to wonder.

3915~~~
I have faith in RVP and Falcao to come good to be honest. If Falcao can get a run of games, he will score goals. His movement is really good and I expect his finishing to still be lethal.

Wilson is also an impressive player, we're adequately stocked for the time being.

3916~~~
I'm glad LVG is putting his foot down and ignoring prices and reputations.

I'm sure Falcao knows within himself that his fitness is  not of PL standard and will take this on the chin; and try and regain some of that form and fitness, despite the media's best efforts to create a mountain out of a molehill. He seems like a sensible player, not a Tevez.

3917~~~
Yep, agreed. He's eager to prove himself.

3918~~~
We aren't free scoring because we aren't coherent as team yet. Bayern are free scoring without having a one goal per game player, they are because they play extremely well which is what we should be aiming for and not just buy a player who can bail us out with his goals.

3919~~~
He needs a run out for the u21's to get some confidence and sharpness.

3920~~~
It isn't the goals per say, but the fact that we have these players with huge names and wages who should perform to that standard. I agree with what you are saying, and would much rather see our tally at the end of the season with RvP, Falcao, Rooney, Mata and maybe even Di Maria and Herrera all in the low double digits than simply relying on one player, but there still needs to be some improvement at the current minute.

3921~~~
Fair enough. I just think a lot of our fans are very rigid when it comes to what we need. We concede a goal, we need a "leader" at the back. We're not free scoring, we need a prolific goalscorer. We're not crossing enough, we need a pacey winger. Fact is there have been great teams without great defenders. Others without winger and others without a great striker. We need to defend and attack better and how we do it can be achieved through different ways. Van Gaal has his idea about how it should be done and I think that his record means he should be trusted even if his judgement might not agree with footballing clichés.

3922~~~
Just read that article. What a load of bollocks.

What it is: LvG fraustrated with fixtures and injuries to other players not allowing him to bring Falcao up to what he considers "match fit". 

What it is not: LvG annoyed with Falcao himself either not doing enough or being too soft. 


I remember someone on here saying recently that word from inside the club is that Falcao is breaking through walls to get fit and nobody has seen anyone train that hard since Ronaldo was there.

3923~~~
A few years is too much IMO. If he's ready now just play him as much as possible.

3924~~~
If we had a 29 year old Scholes in our squad i'd be all for moving Rooney up there. But he's too influential in other areas really.

3925~~~
Yeah. Lets Owen his ass. He'll be crocked by 25...

3926~~~

3927~~~
You can play them young and guide them the right way. Rooney has been playing since 16! Ronaldo and Messi have been playing since their teens. You can't compare Owen's era with the current one, players are starting to get involved at much younger ages.

3928~~~
I think we should sign him. He's probably got 3 years at a top level left in him and like central defenders, top strikers are hard (and expensive) to get because there are so few of them.

More importantly, it's a matter of principle. We're doing right by the player with regards to his injury. If he were at Monaco, he'd probably of played 80 minutes this past weekend. I'd hate for us to pay someone big wages and be patient with their injury, only for some other club to reap the benefits next year.

3929~~~
I dont think we should sign him , he cant get fit, when he is close he gets another injury, there is no doubt he is a class player when fit, trouble is he never is, at the end of the season I hope LVG says thans for your time , but no thanks.

3930~~~
Yup, doesn't make sense. May be at 15m, surely not at 44m.

3931~~~
Looking like another Owen Hargreaves type signing. Thank goodness it's only a loan,

3932~~~
Is only fit to play for 20minutes, something's not right here. I'm starting to think Falcao was a Woodward signing and not LVG, hope I'm wrong.

3933~~~
Wouldn't surprise me. Always thought it was a bit weird that having moaned about a lack of balance in the squad, he went out and signed another striker.

3934~~~
"Owen's Era?" 

Hes 34 for christ sake.

3935~~~
The injury he had here had nothing to do with his knee, we've had a terrible injury record with everyone this season so it's unfair to assume he's injury prone just yet. The only way to judge falcao is to see him starting games again and see where'e he's at after given a full chance to prove himself in terms of form and fitness.

3936~~~
That was my original concern, however, I didn’t want to believe it as we had just signed a player who for me is one off, if not the best forward in World football. Something’s not right though, I just hope that he can turn it on and show the World he can cut it in the Premiership, he is a fantastic player who will help us to the next level if he's given the chance.

3937~~~
How much did we pay for this loan and wages again? It was such a last minute odd deal in the first place. For him to be worth what we paid he will need to be fit for all the 2nd half of the season and bang in 15 goals

3938~~~
It's not down to injury, as LVG it's down to match fitness. He did his ACL, was out for 8 months, barely had a pre-season at Monaco and played a few games before he joined us. He's had a few games with us, and got injured again. So of course the guys not match fit. 

Yeah, sure since he's game back and played some full games since his knee injury. How ever you need a lot playing time to reach the fitness levels to play a high standard of football for 90 minutes, especially after that amount of time out.

3939~~~
People looking for things that arent there talking about this as not a LVG signing - you dont turn down a player like that when presented with the opportunity.  LVG may not have planned it but he certainly wasnt going to walk away when he was given the chance. 

As for the injury, as many have pointed out, this is not the knee.  Every other player who has been injured has followed the same route - played for the U21s before starting a game for the 1st team.  As LVG has pointed out, he couldnt do that with Falcao due to injuries to Rooney and Wilson. 

Nothing to see here.

3940~~~
The past month or so Van Gaal has struck me as being very cautious regarding injuries and rushing players back. I think given the number of injuries we've had and the busy period coming up he doesn't want to be rushing anyone back too soon.

3941~~~
I've been considering it since his return from but still there is always hope.

3942~~~
This.

I can't understand how Van Gaal giving an explanation of why Falcao hasn't played yet, saying he needs to go through the same process as anyone who comes back from injury and get some minutes under his belt, has mutated into Van Gaal questions Falcao's future. Odd.

3943~~~
We would be absolutely mad to sign a nearly 29 year old who can play for few minutes per game for 40m+

3944~~~

3945~~~
People losing their shit over another worthless Jamie Jackson article. Job well done for him then

3946~~~
Why do you all want to definitely judge the situation , right now?

Just wait the end of the season, the informations will be more accurate.

3947~~~
If LVG did say that he's chatting shit and I hope Falcao leaves, when Falcao came I was very happy because I know the talent he has, if Van Gaal thinks he can waste a player like Falcao on the bench then he really has lost it. His whole treatment of Falcao has been odd. Even when Rooney got sent off and it was Van Persie (who I love) that was playing underpar it was Falcao that was brought off even though he playing much better. Even Diego Costa who sounds like he is more injured than Falcao is getting managed properly to play a considerable amount of minutes.

3948~~~
RVP is obviously getting special treatment under LVG, his not played well at all and like someone above has said when Rooney got sent off LVG opted to take Falcao off when he was playing better then RVP.

Falcao needs to start games and if he looks tied replace him, not bring him on in the last 15 mins for a run around when the games already decided! 

When Falcao gets fit and match ready he is the best striker in the PL and maybe the world, LVG needs to handle the situation and make sure the media understands what his trying to say as idiots like Jamie 'biased' Jackson will snatch at the chance to take things the wrong way!

3949~~~
Kind of agree. RvP gets played even though he's in poor form which would also be against LVG's philosophy.

3950~~~
But how else would a player like RVP get back in form? I'm not saying Van Gaal's right, but remember Fergie's last season? RVP went on like a 7-game dry streak, scored a penalty against Stoke(?) and then was on fire for the rest of the season. Maybe Van Gaal knows what he's doing.

3951~~~
Its not Falcao's form that is the issue - its fitness.  I get the point about RVP but his lack of form has sweet FA to do with Falcao's lack of fitness. 

Why are people getting so upset about this?

3952~~~
Agree - it was a good answer by Van Gaal and a very sound explaination about what's helping with Falcao. Naturally, the journalists need a bit of juicy goss for the papers, so taken out of context, it sounds like LVG isn't happy with Falcao. 

Nothing to see here folks, just the usual hyperbole by the papers. (SHOCK, HORROR)

3953~~~
it was a Jamie Jackson article? and people are still believing it..... Oh redcafe

3954~~~
This reminds me of last season.

Last season it was the idiots having a moan about Rooney being a Moyes favourite and how it adversely effected Kagawa. This time it's Van Gaal favouring RVP while Falcao rots on the bench. Falcao has show nothing that merits starting ahead of RVP.

3955~~~
Well the same can be said about Falcao. RvP got plenty of chances to get back in form and it's only fair to give someone else a chance

3956~~~
No games, no fitness. Playing the odd 15 mins wont help him either

3957~~~
Walk around with your fingers in your ears if you want. But the quotes have come from LVG.

3958~~~
Falcao to start tonight, will score 5 in 30 minutes, and then on to the bench. Job done

3959~~~
He can't even do 25 minutes on the pitch. He's unfit as LVG said in the papers yesterday. It'll be Christmas by the time we see him at full pelt.

3960~~~
Falcao's been injured for the past month or so. If we rush him back now, he'll probably get injured for another month or two and there's a whole lot of games in the next month. 

LVG knows what he's doing, we just have to believe.

3961~~~
I don't think its favouritism tbh. When RVP came back into the team after the WC he also had to sit out until he was deemed fit enough to play/start games. I'm not worried about Falcao as long as he doesn't pick up another injury he will start to get games.

3962~~~
He's a big name and shit, but he needs to suck it up and play for the reserves until his fitness it's up to standard. Why didn't he play for the reserves when Herrera did? 

He is used to being the star player maybe and always playing as long as he can move, but he is not the star here and we also have a lot of very good players that are fighting for his position.

3963~~~
According to Van Gaal, it's Rooney's injury who prevented Falcao from playing for the reserve. And before that he wasn't fit enough.

3964~~~
Indeed, I don't really think there is an issue. When hes fit enough he will get games, and from what I have seen when hes fit and start playing we'll be laughing. Hopefully he won't pick up another injury.

3965~~~
The fact that i could take the same quotes and just say, "LVG excited for Falcao return" can change the entire feel of the article.

Jamie Jackson is a troll journalist, he got found out big time during the summer transfer window and now I personally consider him a bit of joke.

3966~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B4Va7MNCIAErVOh.png" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B4Va7MNCIAErVOh.png"/> 

Well his wife says he's fit

3967~~~
One thing we can all agree on is he needs to start taking his chances. He should have had a couple more goals than he currently has, once he starts putting them away I'm sure he will be a permimant starter.

3968~~~
Agreed but i think LVG has explained the situation perfectly well.  He should be playing reserve games but cant due to injuries in the forward line.

3969~~~
Don't see what the fuss is about LVG said he's not fit yet and is treating Falcao the same way our other injured players have been treated. All of a sudden it means it's all over for Falcao, get a grip.

3970~~~
Clearly, LVG's standards are higher than hers. Its apparent that she doesn't expect him to perform for 90 minutes <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3971~~~
Di Maria will prob go straight into the team against Liverpool!

3972~~~
Completely different situation, injuries/history and player.

3973~~~
He might be 100% fit in the bedroom but that doesn't make him 100% fit on the football pitch love.

3974~~~
Not sure it's quite the sure thing there in all honesty.

3975~~~
Yep.
And if you force a player who is unfit to play too much, he will just end up breaking (ie. getting re-injured). You have to increase the duration/intensity gradually.
He still has not recovered from his knee injury and it will take time.
You certainly wont see him at full power in December, given that he can only manage 20 minutes, today.

As a rough guide on recovery times:

In the past, the likes of Alan Shearer and Ruud Van Nistlerooy, also had ACL injuries. They did return, but generally it took a year for them to return to full power.
Roughly speaking:
7 months to recover from injury.
5 months to regain form/fitness.

Another point to remember is that LvG is taking advice from doctors/physios. He isn't making decisions on Falcao, by coin tosses or media reports.
LvG is an experienced manager so we have to trust that he is making informed decision.
The worst decision he can make is to "start" an injured player. This is asking for trouble and could end Falcao's career.

3976~~~
Still one of the players that fans are excited to see on the team sheet. Went to the game last week and there was an air of disappointment he wasn't brought on sooner. 

The frustrating thing is when he has played, he has been involved and looked decent. However, I'm not sure I would be paying £42 mil for him, surely Monaco would struggle to get that off us or anyone else at the moment? Or even in the summer, it's a steep price in my opinion. 

Maybe our plan was not to play him before Jan, ring up Monaco and say we will give you £25mil to get it done now, deal or no deal? He then proceeds to play every games, scoring 25 goals on the way to sealing us the title. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3977~~~
Just imagine if that's true, Falcao plus Valdes that would be machiavellian.

3978~~~
I don't know the in's and out's of the potential deal, but say his 2nd half of the season was much of the same, then there is no way people would go near him for £42 mil. 

Would Monaco entertain a lower offer in Jan from us, to get something in?!

All pure speculation of course, and I would much rather he has a cracking 2nd half of the season and we pay £42 mil for him, but Woody is the gambling man <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3979~~~
From what i understand even if he scores a shitload of goals, Monaco will accept less than 42m£, i think that they will take 20-30m€ without hesitation they need to get rid of his wage and they don't want any problem with the uefa.

3980~~~
If that's the case (and I don't doubt you) then it kind of makes our loan deal look pointless and we are picking up the tab to get him fit. Wouldn't we have been better to see how he recovered with Monaco, arranging a deal for next season. 

I love the guy and I am sure he will come good, but at the moment it all looks a little pointless and we are just throwing wages away. 

Hopefully that will change in a month or so <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3981~~~
That's pretty good news for us then, thought we had to pay £42 mil, (or had agreed to do so).

I would personally start him tonight, LvG can always take him off, then sub him on 60 mins.

3982~~~
I have a feeling he will start today.

3983~~~
I hope he gets on for half an hour or so. I feel he is suited to a counter attacking game. He'll do well if he gets on tonight

3984~~~
At this rate he'll be lucky to get 1 chance in that half hour. Changing our striker is hardly going to turn this game around based on that first half performance.

3985~~~
Only 1 sub left. Unlucky for him.

3986~~~
No minutes for him last night. I assume he won't be starting for Liverpool than, considering it is such a massive game

3987~~~
I knew he wouldn't get on when we forced into an early injury change.

3988~~~
With Rooney fit, Van Persie firing and Wilson a real threat from the bench, I hope he gets 60-90 for the reserves ASAP. 

When's their next game?

3989~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if his loan is terminated before the season ends. Van Gaal only uses players match fit. Falcao's own injuries, and injuries amongst others have caused too many changes for him to come in. Falcao was never a priority. Unless we sort out our main issues at the back then trying to shoe horn another striker in is the least of our problems.

3990~~~
Unfortunately, it's on Sunday.

3991~~~
I don't really expect him to feature against Liverpool. If anything, Wilson will be given a chance ahead of him.

<a class="username" data-user="44029, @Pexbo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/44029/">@Pexbo</a> according to the U21 fixtures calendar, they play City away on Sunday. Which is a shame, as he'll probably be on the first team bench. After that, they next play on 9 January. So I expect him to probably start in the FA Cup 3rd round fixture at the very earliest.

3992~~~
Don't worry lads, it's all set up for hi to come on for the final 20 mins against Liverpool and score an injury time winner <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3993~~~
Pity he didnt get any action against Southampton, Ive been hoping for his game time to be gradually ramped up in each game until he is fully fit, he'll probably end up with 10-15 mins max now against Liverpool.

3994~~~
I think his wife might create a Kaka'/Pellegrini situation if he spends much more time on the bench.

3995~~~
He is increasingly looking like a waste of money, isn't he? But hey, its not my money. I don't know how we can justify taking him on permanently if his situation remains the same.

3996~~~
Clearly we won't take him on if the situation doesn't change. Van Gaal has said as much. To paraphrase "when a player like Falcao becomes availiable you take him on. For us there is no risk though because it's a loan". That in itself suggests that if it doesn't work out we won't buy him. 

The risk was letting Welbeck go but Van Gaal didn't see Welbeck as competition to Falcao, it was to Wilson.

3997~~~
Have had the feeling for a few weeks that he will make his mark in this Liverpool match, still feel that now, if he plays, against their defence, he is bound to punish them.

3998~~~
I have a feeling it will be too tight for his usual cameo.

3999~~~
Ive actually got a sneaking suspicion he will start....Mata being the fall guy.

4000~~~
I had a vivid dream about him last night.

I was back at my old University and he had climbed on top of a building and was threatening to throw himself off. I climbed a tree to talk him out of it but he jumped before I could get near him. I was trying to call 999 but kept getting put on hold while he hobbled around the place, with one of his legs horribly broken and twisted, lashing out at anyone who tried to help him.

It was really intense. The fecker is obviously taking up more of my subconscious than I thought.

4001~~~
Strange dream, bit off topic but last night I had a dream 2pac was down in an orchard with Callum Best, running from the police because they were shouting abuse at a fat woman and Callum  robbed a bottle of cheap CK aftershave for his brother. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

4002~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I can imagine El Tigre lashing out at people.

My girlfriend woke me up last night sleep talking, sitting up in bed saying I was trying to "get around the fence" so I can get out and get my stuff. I was feeling the wall and running my hand across the headboard trying to work out how to get out and I got really aggressive when my girlfriend asked what the feck I was doing and tried to talk me out of leaving the room which is fortunate as I sleep naked and we've only been living in this lodge for less than a week. Someone from one of the 16 other rooms might have had a surprise, the CCTV in the hallway would have had an eyeful at least.

Bit weird though, never done anything like that before!

4003~~~
I really don't understand the situation with him. How he is not match fit after 3 weeks being injury free? I just don't understand it.

He is one of the best strikers in the world and if you have striker of his quality you have to play him week in week out when he is ready. Strikers of his ability usually play through the little injuries like Costa is doing this season, or Rooney against Bayern couple of years ago, even Cisse played for Newcastle 3-4  week ago and he was still clearly injuried.

How he will get match fit if he isn't playing? I just don't understand it. RVP is a good example how we played him this season even if it was obviously that he can't play 90 minutes so he could improve his match fitness. He did and i don't know why we are not doing the same with Falcao.

4004~~~
He needs to play matches.

LvG said he would have played him in the u21s, but then Rooney got injured so he was needed.

4005~~~
Its on a need to know basis.......If I was paying to go to games week in week out I'd be wanting a little more clarity on why falcao seems to be fit but not getting matches to gain match fitness. There is obviously more to this than meets the eye!

4006~~~
Yes he needs matches but there are not a lot matches for the u21s at the moment. As someone said before there is a match on Sunday and i can't see him play for u21s when he will be needed on the bench the same day and after that there is a match in January....
Why not start him in a games and play him like we did with RVP. Then when he gets tired change him. He will be more and more match fit with every game like that. Playing just in last 20-15 minutes is not helpful especially if we are ahead by just one goal and we are constantly defending. He will never get into form like that.
Yes it looks like something is hapening behind the scenes and i just can't understand what could it be.

4007~~~
We can't play 3 strikers though. Unfortunately for him, RVP has struck form just when he was available for selection

4008~~~
Erm, that's exactly what we've done every time they're all fit and available, which sadly hasn't been often.

4009~~~
That experiment seems to have been ditched, regardless of the injuries to the strikers themselves.

4010~~~
If that's the case then he's missed his opportunity to gain match fitness. As you say, he will be needed on Sunday even if it's just for the bench,

We are playing so many games in December that he is going to be needed - from the start too on occasion. Hopefully, he won't be too rusty.

4011~~~
No it hasn't, because they've not been fit and capable of starting games at the same time since we last did it. We've no idea if it's ditched or not, yet.

4012~~~
There should be a thread we could use as a repository for football / United-related dreams. Id have a couple of memorable ones to put in there. (That time you dreamt about me trying to call you but you wouldnt pick up the phone wouldnt count though.)

4013~~~
I'd be amazed if we ever saw that again, when everyone's fit. Unless its a desperate situation like chasing a game or such.

4014~~~
Hope 2nd half of the season he'll get game time and bang goals in.

If not, I'm not too concerned, we've only got him on loan, we'll probably go out and sign Cavani in the summer if things don't go to plan with Falcao.

It's unfair to judge Falcao though, he's not really had any chances to show what he can do.

4015~~~
I fecking hope not!

4016~~~
But just how much real match fitness could he gained in the u21s matches. It is just a different game playing in u21s and in PL. I hope he will be playing from the start in coming matches.

4017~~~
And drop who?

4018~~~
He excites me, like an alluring glance from a mysterious woman. I want to see him play more as his movement and link-up has impressed me so far. I'd just like him to play further up the pitch from the start.


Well, just making runs and getting into positions for more than 20 minutes would clearly help. Also banging in a couple of goals might help confidence and sharpness.

4019~~~
Mata and move Rooney further back.

Similar to how we was playing start of the season trying to accommodate both RVP/Falcao/Rooney, some of our attacking play back then was great, it was just defense that let us down.

4020~~~
Mata sadly. Or reverting back to back four play with Rooney in midfield, RvP and Falcao uptop or changing number 9 and 10 position. A lot of posibilities but i thing this is a job for manager who decided to bring in a player which loan will cost us 16m pounds.

And i don't want to criticised LVG for bringing him in but i just want so see him play in United shirt sooner rather than later because i know he can be a magnificent player for us.

4021~~~
Mata

4022~~~
I can easily see all 3 playing this weekend - with Rooney playing in Mata's position.

4023~~~
I'd like all three to play, purely because it'd scare the living shit out of Liverpool's shit defence.

4024~~~
Will be interesting to see if he does go with all 3.  He did at the beginning of the season when all 3 were fit.  That said, bit harsh on Mata.

4025~~~
Didn't LVG say something along the lines of Falcao won't start a game this side of Xmas?

4026~~~
I remember last season Moyes getting a lot of criticism for playing too many strikers, for bringing on extra strikers, for thinking more strikers meant more goals, for being indecisive and unable to decide which striker to play - and, more importantly, which to drop. 

Playing all three strikers seems like a bad idea to me, sounds like we'd be sacrificing our midfield. Yes, we are a bit top heavy with most of our best players being strikers (or attacking midfieldes). But playing all your best players doesnt usually make the best team. Id like to see Falcao play because he needs to get match fit and we need to have all of them competing for the position on merit. But Id like to see him come on at the expense of RVP (which makes selecting him against Liverpool problematic because when youve had a good game you should keep your place) or Rooney.

4027~~~
Did he say that?

4028~~~
I dont recall that - would have been big news if he did.

4029~~~
As you said RVP will not be dropped because he just got back in form. Or at least i hope he did. And Rooney is udroppable as a captain and because you know he is one of the best players in the team. We have real trouble to fit all the players in when they are fit but i just want to se Falcao playing. When he came to United it was like a dream signing and it would be really bad if he don't get any good run in the team.

But when i am thinking without emotions i agree with you that playing with three strikers is not probably the best idea.

4030~~~
Before Monday i would agree but he was fantastic on Monday night.  Goals aside, his hold up play and movement was phenomenal.

4031~~~
Absolutely, there was a time to drop RVP, we missed it. So Falcao will have to wait, or replace Rooney, or just come on a sub but hopefully for a bit longer than he has been in the last couple of appearances.

4032~~~
It would be interesting if we did play all three and played ADM, Carrick and Herrera behind them.

4033~~~
We ditched it for the West Brom game because we were getting completely overrun and exposing our makeshift defence so I don’t see why we would go back to something that wasn’t working just because Falcao is back.

There isn’t much to read into in terms of why he is being left out, RVP has stated scoring and Falcao still isn’t and may never get back to his previous levels of form and fitness. He will get a chance at some point and he will need to take it otherwise he won’t be signed permanently, from Falcao’s perspective it would be ideal to pick him and play him regularly but getting results is more important at this moment in time so it’s too risky to play him back to fitness when we have other options.

If RVP hadn’t scored 3 goals in last 3 games Falcao might have started on Sunday but as it is he will most likely be on the bench and have to wait until we rotate over Xmas and the FA Cup game to get some starts.

4034~~~
Because we are not going to sign him, its blatantly obvious. They will only play him if we need to from now to the end of the season.

4035~~~
Yes, I think it's a very good idea. Rooney at the tip of the diamond, and midfield of Carrick behind Herrera and Fellaini. Much better than Mata anywhere close to midfield.

4036~~~
I dont think you can draw that conclusion at all.  No doubt he's got a lot to prove but to say decision is already made is naive.

4037~~~
I can draw whatever conclusion i want and my conclusion is that we won't sign him.
The only way we will is if RVP and Rooney got lengthy injuries in the 2nd half of the season and the club had no choice but to play falcao. If he then went on and scored a shit load of goals in the 2nd half of the season, the club would probably have no choice but to sign him.
At the moment though, i don't think the club have any intention of signing him.

4038~~~
Hope he starts along with Wilson in the match against Accrington/Yeovil.  He needs to try to gain some confidence but sadly I think he'll still have no service.

4039~~~
People have been 'having feelings' for the past 4 months. Eventually I'm sure one of these feelings will come true. Hopefully.

4040~~~
To be fair, he has to actually play for peoples feelings to come true.

4041~~~
Hehehe.

I've been saying for a while now: look for him to start in January.
This will be in line with what I'd expect when returning from a ACL injury.
Theo Walcott who got injured at exactly the same time (with same injury), is the yard stick. So keep an eye out for when he starts games for Arsenal. At present he is still not playing games for Arsenal due to injury.

At present, Falcao can only play 20-30 minutes and it would be an absolute shock to me, if he started a game in December.
Unfortunately fans dont want to understand that he is recovering from a major injury and is not ready to start. They are not using logic, but are using "dreams". WTF!!!

If he does start a game in December, I'll be ecstatic because its obvious that he has pace and a lot of hunger.

The bare fact is that, he has been with us for over 3 months. He is a striker who has scored 1 goal in that time. If this continues into next year, we wont be buying him.

4042~~~
Me too. Drop Rooney to the top of the diamond, and have Falcão play along RvP. Both can drop, both can score.

I think it would be too much to ask for:

-----Back 5
-----Carrick
Herrera-DiMaria
-----Rooney
---Falcão-RvP

But a man can dream.

4043~~~
Mata of course, looks really lethargic recently and playing pretty awful for whatever reason

Go back to the diamond then Drop Rooney back and RVP and Falcao up top.

4044~~~
Rooney is captain aka undropable and RVP is RVP for LVG. That leaves Falcao fighting with Wilson for a place and lately in our games we've needed wilsons pace and defensive efforts to close out games. You can argue well Falcao has the quality to close off games by killing them off with goals, well, no he can't yet. He doesn't have the match fitness or sharpness to be relied on in such situations, and Van gaal has not taken the gamble or risk of using him in such situations to get match fitness, no matter who the media says he is. Once were in our stride and bit more comfortable, we will drop our proven ways to provide him his match fitness and give him the opportunity to prove if he should really be here at the end of the season. The media and his wife can jerk him off all day and call him fit

4045~~~
Me neither, he's continued to get slated in France for his performances for PSG, even last night the pundits were saying he needs 4 or 5 good chances to score one goal (they don't rate him)

4046~~~
When RVP wasn't firing, Falcao wasn't fit then got injured. Now he's fitter, RVP has found his form. I'm sure LVG wanted to play all three but the defensively, we need bodies in front of them to win games. Once we find defenders who can be trusted, then we'll be able explore different formations. 
If we qualify for CL, he'll may still be here at a reduced price. I think the deals already done and that's why there's no urgency to start him.

4047~~~
----------------carrick------------------
------herrera------------fellaini-------
-----------------rooney---------------
---------rvp--------------falcao-------

would not mind to see this, if di maria did not make it of course.

4048~~~
Wouldn't mind seeing that against Liverpool porous defence. But I think we'll be back with 3 CBs, so...

4049~~~
We are playing at home so no 3 CB's

4050~~~
I hope so, mate. But our 2 wins against 'top teams' with 3 CBs might change that pattern.

4051~~~
I don't expect us to sit back with 3 CB, least at OT.

4052~~~
His most recently used the 3 CB system away from home but with not having natural full backs he might switch to the 3-5-2. If he plays the 4-4-2 diamond , Carrick slips between the 2 CB's at the back and all of a sudden it's 3-5-2 which is tge beuaty of the philosophy it can be 1 formation attacking and another when defending.

What matters here is we pass the ball well and create chances, if we can do that then formation doesn't really matter!!!

......Carrick
Herrera Fellaini 
......Rooney 
....Rvp Falcao 

If Di Maria ain't playing I'd like to see us setup like this!

4053~~~
Strange signing to say the least.

Although in fifa 15 I start him over RVP. He is quicker and just a as good a finisher.

4054~~~
I think the line up posted has that flexibility - Carrick can drop deeper if needed

4055~~~
I had him on the bench against Liverpool, he came on in the 60th min for RVP and scored 5 mins later. 
IT'S A SIGN I TELL YOU!!!!

4056~~~
Except Van gaal benching RVP wouldn't happen EVER in real life. So your Fifa signs are wrong I'm afraid. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4057~~~
Falcao to come on and have his Forlan moment?

4058~~~
I hope Falcao is fit to start soon; his cameos are always promising despite not scoring. I would start him in a front 2 of a diamond midfield, over Wilson who is good but not yet ready.

4059~~~
Definitely. He's starting to look ready for sure.

4060~~~
He has to start the next game. He is brilliant. Always looking to run off the last man and good with the ball at his feet.

4061~~~
He did okay when he came on. Again a shame its when the game is pretty much over. I like his movement.

4062~~~
Next game. Start him instead of Wilson. Wilson needs minutes too.. but Rooney and van persie are undroppable (and playing well at the moment).
He needs more than 10 minutes when we are either defending a small lead or relaxing after having the game won.

4063~~~
Thought he looked miles off the pace in all honesty.

4064~~~
He needs minutes but you can see what he brings to the team

4065~~~
And still looked better than Wilson.
If we have to play Rooney in mf and 2 strikers then it's him and RvP.

4066~~~
His movement and physicality is very impressive. Just need to see him start.

4067~~~
Today wasn't the right day for him to start probably, but I hope he starts next week. Looks rusty, but minutes of meaningful football is the only thing that will help him. When he comes on, we are either right under the kosh, or the game is already buried. I think a start would do him a world of good, even if he comes off at half time.

4068~~~
His movement was fantastic when he came on.

4069~~~
He's shown flashes every time he's been on the pitch for us so far. He needs to keep being eased in slowly slowly and he will get there.

4070~~~
Needs more minutes. Should take over from Wilson starting at Aston Villa.

4071~~~
No he didn't.

They were both pretty bad.

4072~~~
Hard to make any sort of impact when we are riding in a 3-0 lead, but had some nice runs and looked lively 

He needs to start soon if we are to make a fair assessment of him

4073~~~
Same here. Its understandable though, given he hasn't had much game time since we signed him. 

Hopefully he'll keep himself fit and get a few more starts under his belt over Christmas.

4074~~~
I thought he looked like he's ready to start.

4075~~~
Falcao had about 15 minutes and did ok.
Wilson had 70 and did feck all.

4076~~~
Falcao looked great. Needs to start next Sat v Villa.

4077~~~
Both did feck all.

Also Wilson was playing up top in a tight game, with very little of the ball. Falcao came on at 3-0 up, with us in complete control and looking to push for a 4th. He looked miles off the pace.

4078~~~
Unlucky that RVP pass was a little too strong as it would have set him up for a nice left foot shot.

4079~~~
He did not. Any further discussion with you seems a bit senseless.

4080~~~
I don't understand peoples need to compare. Both are United players and clearly one is VASTLY more experienced. I'm not sure what the point of pace is unless we were planning to play on the counter at home. Maybe LVG accepts the fact we're passing like a team of wankers. Liverpools line wasn't that high up and we struggled to pass from defense to midfield. Falcao looked great when he came on but the game was won. We created more chances in the last third because we had a platform to pick them off. Ideally we want Falcao to start playing so as to show his ability. It's ingenious though to use one game to prove a point because every game is unique and once we started passing properly we created chances. Funny that.

4081~~~
You're seeing what you want because of the name.

4082~~~
Start him against Villa and I'm sure he will get a goal.

4083~~~
He linked up very well considering his lack of game time, and he could have easily been played in by Valencia who hose to hold on  to the ball.

4084~~~
It's a shame we can't get him a full game for the U21's or a mid week friendly. We keep bringing him on at the dead end of games and he get's little time to make an impact. He may technically be fit but his match sharpness demands some proper runouts. It's frustrating for everyone but I hope the second half of the season is where he comes to life.

4085~~~
Looked poor yet again. Not sure what some of you are seeing but it looks like standards have been lowered.

4086~~~
I love watching him, his runs are fantastic. He's always looking to get in behind defenders and asking for the pass. I felt bad for him that we couldn't properly supply him. You could see at one point he wanted the pass from Valencia and was visibly annoyed when the opportunity was lost. When he starts playing more he'll start scoring.

4087~~~
Could turn that round and say the same to you.

It was a 20 minute cameo, there's not much to pick out from his performance today. Put in a decent cross, made good movement, hassled off the ball a couple of times, a poor touch from a throw in. There's little else to talk about here.

4088~~~
Desperately needs 60+ minutes of any sort of match.

4089~~~
Get him starting the Villa game next week and see how he does. No more subbing him on at the end please or preferring Wilson over him.

He's match fit, he's ready. Let's see if he can get back to his best.

4090~~~
That's what David Moyes does to you.

4091~~~
Thought he looked sharp today. Needs to start a game or two.

4092~~~
I don't know what people are thinking, he was poor when he came on and didn't look any more match fit than the last time he played.I don't mind him starting vs Villa though but people who think he's gonna score shedload if he starts are going to be disappointed.

4093~~~
Didn't impress me all that much when he came on, although he arguably needs a full 90 mins and a first team run of games.

4094~~~
Watching the guys movement off the ball is a real learning curb for young strikers. A few starts and he could take off.

4095~~~
this. pity his teammates just can't give him the right ball. a couple of times he manages to make fantastic movements and had the right ball been given we would have been through on goal at least twice during the 10 minutes period he was on the pitch.

should start the next game.

4096~~~
Reminds me of Tevez at his worst right now. Ball seems to bounce off him, crumbles under pressure, looks immobile.

I was mega excited when we signed him but he looks like he's not the same player anymore.

4097~~~
I tend to agree with this. Thought he just looks really slow and sluggish.

I really want him to come good but he is going to need to start games, these cameo appearances are not helping his sharpness in the slightest.

4098~~~
Thought his movement was brilliant. A few times our midfielders delayed a pass that should've gone sooner.

Clearly lacking sharpness though and over-eager to impress.

Deserves a start.

4099~~~
Impossible to judge him without him getting a run in the team. 

Which he might never get at this rate.

4100~~~
£75 million Suarez hasn't scored a goal yet in La Liga int twice the amount of minutes, yet I don't see anyone writing him off?

4101~~~
Give him a consistent run and allow him to gel with his teammates and he'll get more than his fair share of goals.

Still think he's best as a lone striker though, which is why I'm not too sure how he fits into the LVG system.

4102~~~
Falcao's on a loan deal though, so if he doesn't improve then there's a decent chance he may not be here next season.

4103~~~
I agree that he needs a run of games but I can't see how he's going to get it now that Van Persie is back in form.

4104~~~
Everybody is seeing what they want to it seems, he wasnt really special, loses too many battles, good movement tho but not special.

4105~~~
Suarez is doing practically everything else but hit the net, his overall play has been very good and he suits the Barca system so far.

4106~~~
That's why he's got the second half of the season to stay fit and show us that he deserves to be signed on a permanent deal. It is annoying that he is being given scraps of 10 minutes at the end of the game when we have wrapped it up, and he is expected to make a massive impact. I fully expect him to start next game over Wilson and finally get a proper run.

4107~~~
Frustrating touches sometimes but you can see his quality. Also frustrating that he doesn't get game time but it is a risk with his fitness and the general play of the team and one that VG doesn't want to take.

I look forward to the Xmas games where he will surely get a decent amount of game time. Maybe that is the focus. Hopefully he comes good then and provides a second half boost to the season.

Our attack could be pretty brutal.

4108~~~
Really? I'd say he is looking quite out of place on the right hand side, and an absolute shade of himself atg Liverpool. Yes, he has got 5 assists, some of which have been pretty sweet, but he was bought for his goals more than anything else.

4109~~~
But that's guaranteeing he doesn't get injured, or does actually make it into the team considering we have a very competitive frontline.

4110~~~
Looked sharp to me. We are not firing on all cylinders. There's no great width game after game and our passing is awful. We're missing a scholes type that can ping balls into space - balls that favor United players. I think Wilson would be better away from home where teams allow more space but since he needs a game, hopefully Falcao starts against Villa. Not sure what he's going to do if we make a meal out of creating chances. Maybe it's the back lines nerves playing 3 at the back but we need to become more fluid and then Falcao and the like will get the chances. Falcao is all about what he does in and around the box. It's up to the rest of the team to control the play and create chances for Falcao.

4111~~~
I know what you are saying but he isn't going to be the focal point in attack like he was at Liverpool, he is there to give another option and create. He is getting the assists and making the right runs etc. just not finishing his chances at the moment, that should come in time though.

4112~~~
And hopefully this shall be the case with Falcao too, who is doing the same but rather coming back from injury and getting less game time.

4113~~~
Case of the Forlans, start the lad when games arent put to bed, Once di Maria is back providing pace we should see him back starting

4114~~~
I thought he did fine when he came on, hopefully he starts against Aston Villa, he looks eager and LvG said he was ready to start before the game.

4115~~~
He certainly didn't look poor today - just needs more match fitness. He'll get there soon enough.

4116~~~
What would've rounded today off a treat if he had scored but that's me being greedy.

4117~~~
Looked alright, should start a couple of games over the christmas/new year period!

4118~~~
I love his movement. Always looking to dart between defenders, or to make runs beyond defenders. He could have been released a couple of times today if our players had reacted quickly enough. 

He had a couple of poor touches today, but that's understandable. Rooney often comes back from injury with a touch that would make a pub player blush.

4119~~~
Everyone wants it to happen for him, you can just tell. van Persie paid tribute to his efforts and desire in the pre-match stuff and they were looking for him when he came on.

Along with the defensive injuries, Falcao's inability to stay fit and make a huge impact is the only real disappointment this season.

4120~~~
That is obviously not true.

4121~~~
Its amazing that as soon as he came on he linked up well with RVP and not for the first time. I am sure if they are given a chance to start a match together they will destroy any defence.

4122~~~
He did OK but its a shame he's not getting time when the game's are in the balance. Coming on when the games are done and dusted it will be hard for him.

4123~~~
Seemed too cautious at times, understandable due to the knee injury that kept him out for so much time.  However there were some positive signs, namely his movement off the ball, the through ball to van Persie, and his link-up play in general.  However I do believe he needs to start games in order to get more chances in front of goal, the FA cup draw against Accrington/Yeovil is a good opportunity to show what he can do.  Confidence must be boosted and then LVG will make his assessment on Falcao.  At least it's a loan deal and if he' lost it then we can find another striker... Benzema <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Fingers crossed

4124~~~
Must be in line for a start next match? Not having a go at Wilson, but he didn't do anything to keep his place today.

4125~~~
I have got a feeling that he's going to have an amazing second half of the season. 
Well if he's played i mean. I'm not so sure how much the club wants to buy him permanently so there is a chance he won't be played much but if he is played, i have a feeling he's going to do great.

4126~~~
Still thought he looked a bit rusty today. Would like to see more before I'd advocate starting him. Especially seeing as RvP has found some form.

4127~~~
Really hope he starts against Villa, nothing against Wilson but I'd love to see Falcao at his very best for us. Still even now seems surreal he actually plays for us.

4128~~~
It will be a bit gutting if he leaves at the end of the season without even being given a real chance.

4129~~~
Don't think he should be starting right now. Mata behind Rooney and RVP is our strongest lineup, stick with it.

4130~~~
I think that's LVG's plan.  I think we have 4 games in 9 days over xmas and new years.  He will defo start 2 of those.  
If he can do well in those and stay fit, he will be in contention for 2nd half of the season.  I've still not given up on him making an impact.

4131~~~
Is he getting any minutes in the reserves or U21s?

4132~~~
I don't think we've played that since the first international break at the very least.

In fact I don't think Mata's played behind Rooney for an absolute age, too. 

No reason why Falcao can't come in for Wilson and we play a 4-4-2 diamond with Rooney in midfield like we have been.

4133~~~
I think he is now nailed on to start against Villa, which will be critical game for him as after that Di Maria should be back and Rooney will move up front.

4134~~~
Need match time to gain match fitness. Really can't see what these 15min cameo appearances would do to help.

4135~~~
I think we'll be seeing 'all 3' start a fair bit from now on.

4136~~~
Think the deal is already done tbh. Don't think it's anything to do with his performances, but will be based on his recovery from the knee injury only. There's no way a world class footballer is going to a club to prove his worth. He'll be here next year and that's why we're managing his recovery, otherwise we are paying 250k a week to aid his recovery so another team can get the benefit of it next season!!!

4137~~~
For me the main feature so far has been his loose ball control. Every second touch seems like he has to fight for the ball, which reminds me a little of Tevez when he was struggling to convince

4138~~~
But what if he is better than Van Persie when played?. I mean lets not forget how bad RVP has been for most of the season so far.
Its alright saying don't change anything but we COULD be doing even better with Falcao but we won't know if he isn't given a real chance.

I'm not saying just to start Falcao every game and drop Van Persie, i just mean instead of bringing him on late and taking someone off, start Falcao then take him off if its not working. You know not every game but just rotate him a bit with RVP and see how he does. I'm sure its easier to make an impact from the start than coming on in the 70th minute when We are just content with the scoreline and not looking to score more.

4139~~~
You can't judge him on 15/20 minute cameos at the end of matches which on the whole are already won. He obviously needs match fitness which is not the same as just fitness. With lack of under-21 matches the only way he's going to get match fit is by starting matches and hopefully he will against Villa or Newcastle

4140~~~
Rooney needs to stay where he is, Di Maria can take Mata, or Fellaini's place.

4141~~~
I just wish he had a bit of pace and that he was a bit bigger. He has no size to rely on if his touches/legs are getting rusty and that is worrying

4142~~~
Agree. LVG said after the game that he wanted pace up front and chose Wilson next to RVP. Wilson is fast but he's average when it comes to making smart runs, something you'll see plenty of from players like Hernandez or Falcao. That's something we could do with now IMO.

4143~~~
Too similar to RVP for both start especially as he still looks rusty, Wilson didn't have a great game but he was in the side to add pace because pace effects how the opposition can defend, I wouldn't start him until we need to rest RVP over the Xmas period. Hopefully di Maria is back against Villa so I imagine he will start over Falcao.

4144~~~
O ok then thanks for the input captain obvious <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

4145~~~
We're on a 6 game winning run and the strikers are playing well. I don't see why we should change it right now to accommodate Falcao... he will get a start over the Christmas period because of fixture congestion, it's up to him to take his chance.

4146~~~
He's that good if you give him a wig and a beard he could probably take both their places tbh.

4147~~~
He could always take Wilson's "place" if van Gaal insists on playing Rooney deep.

4148~~~
Won't get fit if he doesn't play more, he is ready to start.

4149~~~
I'm of the opinion that Falcao will be here on a permanent contract as LVG has shown way more respect to easing him back in then Monoco did! I've read it normally takes about 12 months to fully recover and get back to full fitness from the injuries Falcao sustained so it's not long before we can unleash the tiger!!!

4150~~~
I'd like to see him start the next match. As much as I would love to see Wilson do well for us, he didn't exactly do a whole lot in his chances against Liverpool. If Falcoa is fit, I'd bring him in for Wilson. Starting matches and playing 60 minutes or so when things actually matter will help his match fitness far more than coming on for the last 15 when the game is already won.

4151~~~
Think he'll start against Villa.

4152~~~
I thought he was pretty poor to be honest. Probably better than Wilson but we were controlling the match easily at that point. I wouldn't start him unless Rooney/Mata/RvP need a rest. I wouldn't be signing him at this point either.

4153~~~
The thing is, he isn't the type of player that will come and get the ball, you need to give him chances. Very difficult for him to show what he can do in 15 minutes. We'll have a much better idea of him once he actually completes 90 minutes for us.

4154~~~
When he came I had a lot of doubt about his fitness. Having seen his “form” with Monaco at the beginning of the season and how fast he came back from injury. He played well at times, and I thought for example that his cameo at WBA was very good. He made an impact playing high and keeping the balls, but then suddenly injured and he’s not reached his form since.

Something telling me that LVG is not fully confident with him, and I’ve the felling that he might be a big flop. LVG could have used him more the last 2/3 games, but he didn’t, but something really annoyed me yesterday when he came in.

He totally looked gutted when he came in at the 73rd. He barely did a run, his body language showed that he was gutted to be benched by Wilson, and his attitude was actually bad yesterday, no confidence and not the good attitude.

I really hope that he’ll prove me wrong, but with RVP firing at the moment, Rooney and Mata combining well, Fellaini and Herrera in contention, Falcao will not have his chance here, and I doubted he’ll have more than 10 goals at the end of the season, and for his 280K/w, I guess it’s a huge huge mistake.

It’s true that we need another forward as we play with 2 now, but not Falcao, not with his attitude. His wife can keep posting images of him, anyway, with this kind of attitude, he’ll be off.

The guy can’t support the competition because he always was the main player, but he dosent even realize that he’s not the same player he was before his injury.

Anyway, I hope he proves me wrong but he won’t

4155~~~
Pretty much your whole argument is based on emotions you assume Falcao has based on his face.

4156~~~
feck sake <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4157~~~
People seriously saying he was poor yesterday???? He was on for 15 mins and the game was dead pretty much.
He also look a little dangerous playing a decent ball in for RVP a couple times too.
I'll reserve judgement one he plays 90 minutes.

4158~~~
He's here since September and we're in December. We keep saying that since !

Chicharito made an impact after 10 minutes and we're still waiting it.

4159~~~
He needs to start games, that's all. 
Once he gets a run of few games only then can we begin to judge him, these 15 mins cameos are pointless!

4160~~~
WTF?

Every time Falcao comes on he seems to be chomping at the bit whilst the rest of our team are looking to settle down/shut up shop for the victory. It's frustrating to see him making runs and other players not fancying trying a through ball (Valencia did this at one point yesterday and i nearly had an aneurysm).

Plus, i don't get where people think he isn't happy. Did you see him celebrating the goals? He was the first to jump out of his seat ffs! The man is being carefully managed at the moment as far as i can see. He'll surely get his chance for a full 90 somewhere in this Christmas period, it's a busy busy time.

4161~~~
Maybe because he has scored a goal and setup 2 depsite hardly being on the pitch? Hes been injured if Chicharito was injured would you have written him off too?
Too many knee jerk reactions, I suppose we should have written off RVP too since he didn't score within 10 minutes of the start of the season?

4162~~~
I'm with you swag. I was shouting at my tv!

4163~~~
Really?
I thought he showed a lot of enthusiasm when he came on, always willing to make the run, tried to get involved in the play. As I said earlier, it's not easy coming on in the last 15 minutes of a game when your team has basically won the match so won't commit a lot of players forward.

4164~~~
Fellaini, I wanted to punch him when he didn't play that EASY through ball for Falcao

4165~~~
Personally I think LVG is managing his injury very well. The worst thing to do would be to give him 90 mins of a highly competitive game and then for him to relapse badly.LVG has already stated he would have liked to give Falcao a couple of games in the reserves but was unable to at the moment due to injuries. However it's also been stated that there have been a couple of games arranged over christmas time to try to get the players who haven't had a lot of match time to get up to scratch.

The other side of the argument of course, is put him on for 90...see how the knee is with a really good test...and if he breaks down, well...we don't buy him!!

4166~~~
The more I watch United play the more I think Falcao will be a key man by the end of the season. No other United striker can match his movement and I think RVP/Wilson as a combination is far too static. Wilson has great pace but I have been very disappointed with his movement off the ball.

Like others have said, he should get to start some games over the Christmas period. Hopefully a couple of goals will kick start his season.

4167~~~
We've only seen a glimpse of what he can do so far. But good to hear LVG say he's fit now, and I loved the RVP pre-match interview where he described him as being "right up there", and thats he's training really hard, and WILL succeed. Here's hoping

4168~~~
Once he remains fit I suspect an RVP-Falcao strike partnership will play a prominent role for the rest of the season. The few times they have played together showed that they readily look for each other and LVG has made it clear that he does not see Rooney as a striker.

4169~~~
Has his fitness/injury situation changed?
Why are people suggesting that he should start against Villa?

4170~~~
Some posters here think Falcao is some amateur mug. Typical Brit mentality. This guy is a world-class striker and we're treating him like Darren Fletcher. If he doesn't start one of the next two games, his career is never going to kickstart at Man Utd. We can't treat a Ferrari like a Citroen for crying out loud.

4171~~~
I'd imagine LVG hasn't been starting him because of his injury problems - he'll know the guy has class.

4172~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4173~~~
He was a world class striker I don't think it can be said with any certainty he still is, of course there is no guarantee he isn't either but the results of the team take precedent over falcao's recovery. It's a tough call either way because we won't know unless we play him but I think it makes sense to wait until we need to rest RVP over xmas, see how he gets on and then go from there.

4174~~~
Fair enough.

4175~~~
It takes around 12 months from what I've read to get back to match fitness and fully fixed! 

Lvg knows that he needs to ease him in and has experts to advise him.

We can sit here all day thinking we've signed a lemon but the reality is Falcao is world class and one of the best #9's on the planet!! I repeat he is one of the best #9's on the planet!!!

4176~~~
If he's fit to start, Aston Villa is the game to do it. It's all well and good saying he shouldn't waltz back in and claim a spot because he's Falcao but it's a pretty short sighted. 

The fact is that we signed him <b>because</b> he's Falcao and its stupid if we don't use opportunities like this to get him match fit and firing. 

With our injuries it's essential we get him kicking on. If Van Persie gets injured we could struggle for goals.

4177~~~
Who do you drop for him?

He's come back at a bad time. Rooney and RVP are finding goal scoring form. And Mata has been productive when he has played. 

I'd start him in the Newcastle or Spurs game.

4178~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
I'd imagine thats how Chelsea supporters sounded like when they got Torres...

4179~~~
Drop Wilson for him and let Wilson come on as a sub for him around the 60 mark. 

*Probably Fellaini

4180~~~
He's going to have to start soon.  It's not like RVP can start all three games from Dec 26-Jan 1.  Three games in 7 days will give Falcao his opportunity.

4181~~~
Which is why I think it's essential to start him against Villa

4182~~~
We're being lead by a Dutch though, one of the best in his job. If he says that he's not ready then he's probably not ready.

I do feel uncomfortable seeing the club spending 45m on a 29 year old striker irrespective of how many goals he scores. Its not as if he's surrounded by 20 year old strikers who would relish from his experience.

4183~~~
He will start against Villa IMO.

4184~~~
He'll be here next season. Clear to me that he's our player and we want to make sure he's right in the long term. He needs games but like someone has said, we are talking about a player that once fit is probably the best No 9 in the world.

4185~~~
The only difference is we are on a pay as you go where as Chelsea went ahead and signed a contract<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4186~~~
Lets not forget that Torres was fit.
He was getting lots of playing time.
He just couldnt score.
IMO, had Torres had stayed and played, I think Chelsea would not be so far ahead.

Falcao's problem is a major injury, which takes time to recover from - usually 12 months.
He got injured in January, so my guess is that we will see him start games (and play 80+ minutes), in January.

4187~~~
Start him against Villa. Stop fecking about LVG.

4188~~~
For me, if we replace Mata for Rooney and have Di Maria in midfield, it would be the perfect formation with a fit defense.

4189~~~
Agree completely. Hope he starts against Villa.

4190~~~
Yeah that's the vibe I'm getting tbh, if he wasn't ours we would have been much more likely to rush him in, especially when van persie was stinking up the joint.

4191~~~
I was impressed with him in his short cameo against Liverpool and I think some people can be quite brutal in their assessments of him so far.

It's a similar story to van Persie in terms of his movement not being recognised by teammates. On a few occasions he made sharp, diagonal runs between the centre backs and fullbacks and pretty much every time, a teammate squandered the opportunity and failed to pick him out. I love how well he dovetails with van Persie as well. Despite both being conventional nines, that really could be a blossoming strike partnership in the making.

4192~~~
They have actually linked up quite well during the limited time they've played together

4193~~~

4194~~~
Its hard to feel sorry for someone whose in the top elite players when it comes to wages but I honestly feel so bad for Falcao, especially insulting him with these 15 minute appearances when we're doing nothing to help him score but passing around the back. 

To top off his bad luck he's back fit now and RVP has looked the best striker in the league the past two games (Aguero and Costa injured)

4195~~~
It looks like the clubs plan to push him out is working, what a shame.

4196~~~
There's no way Rooney and RVP start all the games over Christmas, he will get a start or two soon.

4197~~~
Eh?

It looks like he would like to play more, that's all. Which we knew already.

4198~~~
Or his value down?

4199~~~
Hes said he wants to stay, not sure what the fuss is about, he'll get games as long as he stays fit.

4200~~~
Depends what your mindset is. To me, these quotes feel more like Falcao forcing the board to keep him rather than the opposite.

Full interview here: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Dec/Radamel-Falcao-on-fitness-and-competition-for-places-at-Manchester-United.aspx?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...e=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=ManUtd</a>

4202~~~
What? Please explain as I must be missing something here...

4203~~~
Let's just get the guy on at the start ASAP, preferably against Villa. I cant stand the anticipation any longer.

4204~~~
They don't have to push him out, he's only on loan

4205~~~
That wouldn't make sense. I don't doubt it happens but I can't see it in this scenario. We have literally just signed him on loan. And by we I mean the current management literally a few months ago. It's not like there has been a change in management and they knew what they were getting in that he was coming back from injury hence the loan deal (one of our last buys of the transfer window).

Every player wants to play every minute. He will get his chance, you can even tell he's lacking match fitness from his touch and maybe VG doesn't want to take the risk. Even the likes of Anderson and Cleverly had more than a chance.

If he doesn't get a game at Christmas then we know there is something going on.

4206~~~
It really does annoy me a lot when Falcao and RVP make some brilliant runs and our midfielders always choose the sideways passes. Also Wilson hasn't really done much either so I think Falcao needs to 100%start against Villa. If he finds the net then I doubt he will stop scoring tbh. 

The sitter he missed against Hull though was shocking!

4207~~~
I'm sure he attempted like twenty runs when he came on against Liverpool. The poor guy is trying so hard. Hopefully he starts against Villa.

4208~~~
Im not sure LVG wants him. He will need to be pretty special for the 2nd half of the season to splash the cash

At the moment Im thinking we got rid of Welbeck for a crock.

4209~~~
Id imagine Monaco may have some influence on how we've brought him back from injury to be fair.

If he doesn't start against Villa then something is wrong though

4210~~~
He'll get plenty of chances before this season ends, and there's nothing wrong in his interview. Nothing wrong with LvG wanting to start Wilson. Total non story to be fair.

4211~~~
Sign him, then immediately set out a 'plan to push him out'?!

Probably the silliest thing I'v read on here for a while.

4212~~~
You think we would've signed him without LVGs approval?

4213~~~
Saw this. Hopefully him and Herrera start against Villa. Fellaini was poor in general on sunday i thought, and i couldn't believe he didn't thread Falcao in that time. Carrick and Herrera should find him plenty of times.

4214~~~
He will get games. There's this theme this season with United fans, if a certain player isn't starting then LVG doesn't like him, is far up RVP's ass, doesn't rate him or stuff like that. He's coming back from a serious injury that takes around 1 yr to get back to 100% - the manager is also getting advise from his medical staff, there's also the small matter of "who to drop" as RVP is now back in form, Rooney always good and is captain, Mata gradually getting in on the groove of things, team balance etc. It's not as easy as some of you think it is. Even Rafael has been training for the past 2 weeks, but Valencia keeps his place at RB. The manager has to be fair as well to those who are playing and doing well, it's not easy at all. We all need to be patient, Falcao will get games and I hope he takes his chance when he does.

4215~~~
I think Falcao's definitely starting. Not sure if Herrera will, because it's quite hard to drop Mata after the Liverpool game, and I don't see LvG dropping Fellaini.

4216~~~
He will get his chances, it's up to him to take them and I think he will, he has too much quality to fail. He just needs to play his game and not get frustrated and the good games and goals will come.

4217~~~
This is the quote which interests me:

Previously, I was under the impression that he was recovering from injury and that he would gradually be introduced back into the team, starting with 20 minute appearances.
BUT, if the player himself is saying that he is almost 100%, he could certainly play 60 minutes.
So, what's going on here?

4218~~~
Why change a team which has won 6 games in a row? 
Serious question.

4219~~~
The problem is simply Rooney is captain and won't be dropped or rested and Van Persie has just started to hit a bit of form since Falcao came back and Van Gaal won't suddenly drop him during a purple patch. Van Gaal actually said Van Persie has been lucky that Falcao has been out injured during his poor form. He will get a start eventually, fingers crossed he takes it.

4220~~~
isn't he only 2 league goals behind Welbeck, despite playing the equivalent of 3 league games versus Welbeck's 10 or so more?

4221~~~
No it isn't. Van Gaal recently said he's only fit enough to play 20mins. We've won 6 in a row, so why suddenly disrupt things?

4222~~~
We could play better. Let's face it, when Di Maria is fit, he'll be back in. Falcao is better than Wilson, when he's fit he should play.

4223~~~
Every one of our signings this season have been injured. We are just incredibly unlucky with injuries.

4224~~~
As we all know Welbeck isn't just about goals

4225~~~
Exactly, he's about falling over as well.
<span style="color: #ffffff">Joke</span>

4226~~~
A little harsh Getsme....if we are going to persevere with 2 up top a worker like Welbeck alongside the more clinical type could well be better be better than Wilson plus one? I mean We seem to be reluctant to play Falcao and RVP together for Pace and other such reasons anyhow.....and Wilson doesnt have Welbecks workrate or the quality right now of an RVP so its debatable the advantage of letting welbs go....

4227~~~
Why are people still talking about Welbeck. 

Hope Falcao starts against Villa and bags a couple of goals.

4228~~~
Have you watched those 6 games

4229~~~
Same team as sunday with falcao replacing wilson .

4230~~~
Yeah most likely, unless there's another injury in training

4231~~~
He's here on loan. We don't need to push him out. If we don't want him we don't sign him.

4232~~~
Unless di Maria's back then he might be sat on his arse again for an hour

4233~~~
Was only joking mate.

4234~~~
So was I in a very serious way <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4235~~~
And if he doesn't the weekly wage we are paying out is just odd. I mean its the season of giving I understand but jesus, if he isnt playing him for pace reasons why the hell did we loan him...to play instead of RVP..LVG's prodigal son?

4236~~~
I don't think the answer is to throw a semi fit striker in, do you?

4237~~~
I think the long term plan is to play both him and RvP. Rooney and AdM deeper with Carrick/Blind in there with them. 

Hope he starts against Villa, even though I'll bloody miss the game because of a wedding!

4238~~~
Great thing then that Falcao set up 3 or 4 goals as well then in the limited time he's had on the pitch.

4239~~~
2 according to the stats above

Listen Im not doubting at all what he once was. But I am very much on the fence on what he can bring to Utd in the future and IMO it will be a huge risk to sign him permanently. He would want to be pretty damn special in the 2nd half of the season


If we dont sign him itll have been a shame we got rid of a really good player in Welbeck to make space for Falcao who could turn out to be a huge waste of cash.

4240~~~
He isn't fully fit so he hasn't been playing. I don't doubt for a second that Van Gaal would choose Falcao over Wilson if both were in the same condition.

Stop panicking people. He will get the chances to prove himself. He has to take them. We won't spend that amount of money on a player because of how good he used to be.

4241~~~
Rightly or wrongly it seems as though Van Gaal just didn't fancy Welbeck as a striker. It we decide not to sign Falcao, we'll probably still go for another striker who is likely to be better than Welbeck at least on paper.

4242~~~
Wilsons pace means teams can't squeeze us so easily and to be honest Falcao's miss was not that bad he hit the target and it got blocked!

4243~~~
Agree when Falcao and RVP play together teams can easily squeeze the play because neither has any pace and we don’t play with wingers. Doesn’t work as a partnership for me and I hope we don’t go back to trying to play the two of them together, if Di maria is fit I would start him in place of Wilson but if he isn’t I think Wilson should remain in the team.

Falcao can start against Stoke or Spurs and Yeovil and then can go from there, he is just a bit unfortunate that as soon as he got himself fit RVP started scoring.

4244~~~
I agree. A Falcao full of confidence would have smashed it into the roof of the net. It was a safe finish of someone who hasn't played for ages. I thought Dawson did extremely well to block it regardless.

4245~~~
We need to get this guy fit. He is a monster in front of goal.

4246~~~
Was excited when he signed and have been disapponted/frustrated with his slow return. I think the questions/whispers about his fitness won't go away until he gets a run of games.

I imagine this recent flurry of articles that he's ready to fight for a first team spot means that he'll get some starts over the Christmas period-which will be fun.

4247~~~
If he's playing as poorly in training, as he has in his last few cameo's, its really no wonder he's not starting. 

If he impresses, and most importantly is fit, he'll play. Its not rocket science.

4248~~~
To some extent this is true, but it's not like Falcao is particularly slow, and RVP has looked sharp with his runs, both can make insanely smart runs without needing too much pace. They seemed to gel nicely the few times they played together, and if opponents are pressing hard against us, our midfield plays an important role in dealing with that too. It's not just the strikers.

Would love to see any team with one or two attacking minded fullbacks to try and squeeze us as much as they can. If our defense and midfield keep calm on the ball and our tactics are right, their CB's will be 1 on 1 vs. Falcao and RVP a lot. They'll get slaughtered, no doubt about that, and I wonder how many teams would be that naive in their set-up. 

Whether in a 3-5-2 or a 442ish shape, that's the thing I like the most abut playng with two strikers. But Di Maria is also a great option to have up front, a bit like Robben for Holland.

4249~~~
I'm keen for Wilson to do well, but to be honest, you could forget he was on the pitch against Liverpool and he looked too lightweight against Stoke. Pace isn't something that by its very presence is worth having. It only matters if the player can use it to do something. Wilson's pace counted for not very much in his last two games because he couldn't do anything with it. I still think that Falco offers more right now than Wilson, even if he is slower.

4250~~~
Oh I know he's class. Though what I would say is that he's facing the classic step up a lot of kids have. He seemed really fast and strong in the youth set up compared to everyone else and he used that to his advantage. But he's not able to bring that to the senior game yet because he no longer has the physical advantage he used to over the kids. Just the opposite, everyone's bigger than him.

He'll get it back as his body fills out (you can just see that he's going to mature into a great athlete from his shape) but I think he might be at least 9-12 months away from being there yet. At youth set up he could go shoulder to shoulder with anyone he came up against and win, but against Stoke in particular he just lacked the kilos of muscle needed to shield the ball, or win a tussle, or power into a header, against some of the giants they played.

4251~~~
I think you are making too much of Wilson's lack of height.
Messi, is the best example of this.
If you are good...you are good.

Similarly, just because you are tall, like P.Crouch or Carrew, does not mean that you will be the best striker in the World.
There are far more attributes to power and height.

Our most expensive signing (Di Maria), is built like a fly. That's another good example.

Rooney, at the age of 16, certainly did not have the power of 25 year old defenders. But he did rather well, too.

I can go on giving examples...but you get my drift.

4252~~~
He hasn't been poor though.

4253~~~
How much pace does Wilson really have? Haven't seen him for the reserves so can't give an opinion. Remember him running through City the other day but apart from that i can't remember us using his speed that much.

4254~~~
I remember him chasing down Sterling at full speed, he closed him down. Wilson is reallyyy fast.

4255~~~
Looks as if he has skill as well. Will be good to have more of an Aguero type threat up front.

4256~~~

4257~~~
Looks quick. Thanks.

4258~~~
This is coming from a 5'8 type of guy, but Wilson doesn't look small, he looks quite above average whenever I see him.

4259~~~
I can sense a Falcao goal tomorrow, it's coming and if we play attacking football and create chances, he could score a few <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4260~~~
All the noises coming out of the club lead me to believe this guy is going to have a very good second half to the season, providing he can stay fit

4261~~~
If Louie have the same belief in Falcao like in RVP then he's sentenced to succeed here. Even Fellaini plays way better under recent management.

Win/win situation anyway. It's a loan and it gives sense of security but I'm quite convinced that he'll have an impact.

4262~~~
I've built myself up for a Falcao start tomorrow. Don't disappoint me LVG.

4263~~~
He has in his last few cameos. Ever since the West Brom game and his injury.

I reckon he'll start tomorrow mind.

4264~~~

4265~~~
I think he's done most things well. Certainly in terms of hold up, link play and movement.

4266~~~
Surprised nobody has mentioned Falcao´s first touch against 'Pool. Was an absolute gem. Took him all of 3 seconds to make far more of an impact than Wilson.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5uZMXVY1v2c?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

4267~~~
Was the camera misted up or something?

4268~~~
I agree that Falcao would offer more, but IMO you're being a tad harsh on Wilson. He worked his socks off against Liverpool but lets be honest, we're shit at getting the ball to our forwards. I can't remember the last time we bombarded the opposition's box with passes. Our goals are all coming from crosses or set pieces. Contrast this to Arsenal or even Chelsea who pass the ball at will in their opponents' 18 yard box. Welbeck is seeing a lot of the ball over at the Emirates. RVP has had to dig deeper these last few games to get on the ball

4269~~~
He wasn't poor vs Liverpool your being harsh tbh

4270~~~
People are looking for things and over analysing way to much. He's not been very good so far. A bit of decent holdup play isn't really that impressive for a player of his calibre. 

Liverpool was his worst cameo so far. His best being West Brom away.

4271~~~
Didn't say he has been very good. Just that he hasn't been poor in the short cameos he has had recently.

4272~~~
Anyone notice that Falcao and Van Persie are the only strikers who always pass to each other? For such an out and out goal scorer Falcao is very unselfish and always looks to feed his main competitor Van Persie. With Wilson and Rooney its like they completely avoid RvP at times.

4273~~~
We didn't get Falcao for what he does outside the box. That's just an added bonus. We lack in certain areas of the pitch to give the strikers the best service. Our width is not always great and it's lacks imagination. Anyone can mark Young in their sleep because 9/10 he'll put in an in swinger and Valencia is similar. He'll usually dither.

Falcao's been unlucky. He hit the bar on his debut with a great effort and I think the 'miss' was a fair effort. Wilson suits away from home better but we lack quality and it's a shame we've no Scholes to spread the play effectively. Would like to see RVP Falcao and Rooney tomorrow but we need to pass it a hell of a lot better then we have to make the most of the players we have.

4274~~~
It's really hard to judge a player that has hardly played, has hardly been fit, and when playing is only getting 15/ 20 minute appearances.

He needs a good 4 or 5 full games to show what he can do in my opinion.

4275~~~
Your being hyper critical.

4276~~~
Got him down to score today <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

4277~~~
Still looks absolutely miles off the pace quite frankly.

4278~~~
Strong as an ox but our midfield/defence seem to have an allergy to passing the ball into our strikers.

You can tell he is up for it but the lack of service is disgraceful.

4279~~~
It's incredibly frustrating seeing him in the right places during attacks, and the deliveries being as they are. He made a fantastic run on RvPs through ball and unfortunately didn't finish it, but at least he is making those sort of breaks. The finishes will come in due course.

4280~~~
He's done absolutely nothing. And before anyone point out about the lack of service, it hasn't stopped RVP from being involved.

4281~~~
He's running out of time.

4282~~~
I think he's been alright. He's had no service whatsoever mind.

4283~~~
6 months to be precise.

4284~~~
He makes movement but nobody passes the ball to him. Too many pointless backwards passes.

4285~~~
Holds the ball up ok.

But you'd probably expect more from someone of his rep.

4286~~~
Rooney should have played him in when we had that 3 on 3 where he passed to Van Persie out wide.

4287~~~
Yeah like scoring without being passed to

4288~~~
What to expect? The two strikers have consistently not performed well in this formatting, no matter who it is up front. It's easy to mark them. They can't do shit because they back four and defensive midfielders only need to keep shape. You can't force your way through that so all that the strikers can do are make themselves available and make runs, which they usually do. It just doesn't amount to anything.

4289~~~
Pretty much this. We don't build up enough for our strikers to penetrate the back 4 like we used to. Our play gets slowed down so often that it disrupts the runs they usually make, and we're back to crossing it in when their defence and midfield are settled and it makes getting the ball to our strikers much more difficult. It's infuriating to watch and I imagine even more infuriating for Falcao and RvP to experience.

4290~~~
I have not really watched a lot of him before he came to United, but isn't it safe to say that he is a much more refined version of Javier Hernandez? With that in mind, doesn't that mean he needs service to thrive? I have not seen that much services from our midfield to our strikers or any coming specifically to him in this dual striking system.

4291~~~
We just don't know how to play him, a waste of a transfer so far for us and him.

4292~~~
He is strong enough to hold the ball up but I've seen our players time and time again ignore him in the last third for a lateral pass or back pass.

4293~~~
For all the people blaming the midfield/other players/formation, RVP hasn't looked crap today. He's got involved and a couple of times had half chances.

Falcao has done nothing.

4294~~~
I don't understand these kind of comments. They almost seem cliche....

He's made numerous off-the-ball runs, which, if spotted, lead to chances. He's held the ball up pretty much every time he's had it. Of all the players on the team he's the one who has <i>least </i>been caught holding onto it too long. There's no discernible lack of physical effort as far as I can tell, so, when someone makes the statement of him being miles off the pace I have to wonder what that means for all the others?

If anything....... the good work he's done has been neglected through poor service and poor tempo.

4295~~~
Knee jerk reaction, but Benteke looks like he has much more in his locker than Falcao. Strength, pace, intelligence, aerial presence and power. Not saying the former is the better player, just implying their are option if Falcao fails to live up to expectation.

No surprise that he scores <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4296~~~
Have it!

4297~~~
feck yeah. That's the bloke I've seen on the telly before.

4298~~~
Been waiting for that headed goal from him. A proper Falcao goal.

4299~~~
Love the reaction, he's fired up.

4300~~~
Get in ! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4301~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4302~~~
His first start since he scored against Everton. He will get you goals. He's a lovely man.

4303~~~
He falls over quite a lot, doesn't he?

4304~~~
Credit where its due, that header was fantastic. Seriously good.

The rest of his game was pants though.

4305~~~
He's actually pretty good.

4306~~~
Play him.. he will give you goals... But  didnt we say the same about Chicarito..

4307~~~
Typical Falcao header.

4308~~~
Except the goal, I thought he was poor.

4309~~~
We need to give him the service and passes that he deserves.

He is making runs that are being ignored.

4310~~~
People saying he was poor, he isn't the type of player that's going to beat players on his own, if you provide him with half decent service he will score goals and a lot of them.

4311~~~
Bizarre. 

He was consistently involved in lead up, made runs, was working his socks off. Still getting used to his teammates and vice versa.

4312~~~
He looked good today considering the forwards barely got any chances from midfield. He played quite deep at times but I'm glad he got the goal.

4313~~~
He thrives off good service which he rarely got today.

4314~~~
Not half as much as the one he replaced.

4315~~~
Good goal but had a  poor game otherwise. His link up play was probably the worst its been considering  he got a whole game.

4316~~~
If he's a striker that will only thrive with good service then he's never going to be worth £43 million or whatever ridiculous figure it is.

Benteke had feck all service and looked miles more threatening today.

4317~~~
That's not how I saw it. I think he struggled to get in the game, but tbf the service he got was terrible.

4318~~~
Do people actually watch him by saying he was poor? Aside from the goal, he was the player making the most runs into the box, the most touch-and-goes forwards, and he was always fighting hard for the ball. I would give it a 7/10 in a quite frankly poor performance where he was one of the better, more threatening of our players.

4319~~~
Good goal, but in fairness he hasn't contributed half what Chicharito could've done so far this year. Injuries aside of course.

4320~~~
Great goal but I felt that he was rather poor today, especially first half (but then again, so was everybody else).

4321~~~
Thought he was ok today. Held the ball up well and scored a great goal. Get the sense he'd be a lot better up top on his own, though.

4322~~~
I still find it difficult to judge him as the service has always been so poor to him every time he's played. I can only think of one opportunity he's had this season that he should of scored and hasn't. 

Take RVP for example, who seems to have been in a bit of form up to today. He really struggled to show himself in this game as well, and I'm convinced it's to do with the service and the slow build-up, rather than all the blame being on the strikers. They are making decent runs that we seem too scared to play balls to, for fear of losing possession.

4323~~~
2 goals in 2 starts? he wasn't at his best but was anyone really expecting him to put in a 10/10 performance after such a layoff? Let him get back into the groove and getting used to playing in the PL before we start to judge him. Great goal anyway.

4324~~~
If we ever start having consistent service to our front men then we will get to see how good he is, feeding off scraps again today but his allround play was excellent.

4325~~~
Vintage Falcao header today. I thought his all-around play was great. Holds the ball up well and makes smart, quick lay-offs.

Really needs more quality service, which he barely had today. Glad he played the full 90.

I love his passion on the celebration. Hope he can continue to make a real impact for the team.

4326~~~
I also hate this sentiment it used to come up a lot with Mata too, and RVP  last season.

The service was not world class by any means but it wasnt terrible either and one of Falcaos strengths  has always been scoring from anywhere and everywhere and  often by himself. He can still do a job this season mind.

4327~~~
Took his chance excellently. Looked dangerous upfront and even had some semblance of a partnership with RVP.

Unbelievable decision by LVG to pull off RVP instead of Mata. Especially as RVP has been in such good form.

4328~~~
Average performance, decent goal. I still think once everyone(di Maria and Herrera mainly) catch up with their form, and we move Rooney forward, there will be no place for him. Van Persie is better striker for me, Rooney is undroppable, or in better form than Falcao anyway.

4329~~~
Seeing him score again was the biggest positive today. He looks fit enough to me. He's got plenty of body strength and his all round game is pretty decent. It's just a shame the football we're playing at the moment isn't creating enough chances for strikers to feed off. You can see him making runs and clever movements in the box, but the ball keeps getting passed sideways instead. 

That 90 mins will have done him a lot of good and we should see him getting more action from now on.

4330~~~
I only saw the second half and he played well, laid the ball off nicely and scored a good header. His movement was also really good and he's always in and around when the ball is in the box. Getting 90 minutes under his belt will have done him the world of good.

4331~~~
Thought he was really good today, looked sharp and an excellent finish with the header for the goal.

4332~~~
Glad he scored and got valuable minutes under his belt. Pleased with his performance.

Let's hope this time he can push on.

4333~~~
Great header today. A striker that is a predator aerially brings a different, much-needed dimension to our attacking play.

4334~~~
Maybe was resting him ahead of the next few games?

4335~~~
Very pleased with him today.

4336~~~
Took his goal well.

4337~~~
RVP going off while mata stayed on cost us the points. I think we would have got a winner with RVP  staying on. Then again hindsight is great.

4338~~~
I so want Falcao to succeed here.

4339~~~
Thought he did quite well today, I was also very pleased that he completed 90 minutes!

4340~~~
Very pleased with him today took his goal well and his movement is phenomenal. Glad he played 90 mins today it will do him well.

He didn't get the service which he requires, there was one break we had where Rooney could have slotted him through but chose to pass to RVP on the wing which he looked disappointed with.

I hope he shows the world that his still 1 of the best #9's on the planet.

4341~~~
He was solid today but I still don't wanna sign him. We're gonna spend a boatload of cash on a 28 year old striker who had a massive knee injury and has constantly battled injury problems so far this season.

4342~~~
He was okay, he scored. Puts him in contention for the next matches obviously

Needs about 4 of those a match to be worth us signing him

4343~~~
You want him to score 4 goals a match?

4344~~~
Love reading the posts before and after a goal. Unbelievable the way the mood swings <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4345~~~
If he scores 4 headers like that per game from now till the end of the season he'll probably be worth £45 million or whatever in spite of his injuries, yes

4346~~~
He just doesn't look like he has enough about him to be a £43 million player. You think of the top strikers in the world right now, Aguaro, Suarez, RVP, Benzema, Ibrahimovic..all players that just have that something 'special' about them. They don't 'just' score goals. I haven't seen that in Falcao yet at United. 

The common line seems to be 'he needs service' or something to that sentiment, well for me, a £43 million player should be able to shine even without amazing service. He should be able to stand out as being something special. And that means a lot more then having 'good movement' and 'decent hold up play'.

4347~~~
For some reason this thread becomes invisible to me. 

Pleased he got a goal.

4348~~~
He looked decent today, so glad he started over Wilson.

So much passion when he scored, reminded me of Ruud. 

Needs to start again on boxing day, leave Wilson on the bench.

4349~~~
Glad he scored but don't see him and RVP working well together, think we should rotate them over next three games and then pick whoever is in better form from then onwards.

He is an out and out goalscorer so he needs service but he isn't going to get that with the lineup we had today tend I think he would be much more effective if he wasn't playing with RVP.

4350~~~
If he finishes the season with 86 goals in 38 games that'll be some feat, certainly. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

4351~~~
If he plays 38 games that'd be a wild feat of its own

4352~~~
He can create goals on his own, the "needs service" argument is meaningless. He's only started twice (?) for us and scored both times. A player who scores when he starts is worth big money. This is a player who scored a hat trick against Chelsea not that long ago.

4353~~~
Well thats not true. He started vs Leicester and West Ham and didn't score in either.

Him scorning a hat trick two years ago has no relevance to him being worth £43 million right now. Hernandez had (has) a great record himself vs Chelsea, and also tends to score goals when he starts. Doesn't make him worth £43 million. You need a lot more to your game to be worth that kind of money imo.

4354~~~
Chuffed he scored. I really do want him to succeed here so I hope he stays fit and scores regularly. Two goals in two starts is not bad.

How many goals do people think he has to get for us to buy him?

4355~~~
I think you need to look at Falcao's body of work to see that he is capable of being, and has been at points, the best striker in the game.

4356~~~
So people keep saying. But what Falcao did or didn't do two years ago matters not a jot. Its about what he does right now for United.

4357~~~
Great goal today.

a hustle player who can be deadly if he gets a good groove going.

4358~~~
No doubt in my mind he will keep scoring if we keep playing him.

4359~~~
I'd love to see him play as a lone striker with two pacey wide forwards either side of him.

4360~~~
fecking bullshit <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4361~~~
Do we have any? Except di Maria who is shambles over there?

4362~~~
Goal aside, he was poor.

4363~~~
He really wasn't. Link up, hold up, movement, runs, all good. He did the right things. We just didn't create much.

4364~~~
He was decent, despite having pretty poor service all game. Reckon he'd have scored that one on one that RVP missed.

4365~~~
Well that's a fair point, we don't, although I think Di Maria could play well in the position if we set up with a consistent formation.

4366~~~
He's the closest I've seen to an RVN for a while. With good delivery, he'll absolutely dominate in this league. We just don't create anywhere near enough chances. 

He hasn't shown it yet, but he's a beastly box player. That header today, as simple as it seems was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

4367~~~
So glad he scored!

4368~~~
Ah back to the movement and hold up play. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4369~~~
Well if we aren't creating chances, what else do we judge him off?

If Costa was out there playing for us, the results would be similar.

4370~~~
As I said earlier in the thread, if he's a £43 million player he has to be able to produce without always needing service.

Thats what special players do.

4371~~~
It's a finely poised scenario.

We might not start creating loads of chances until after another summer transfer window, but if Falcao hasn't shown enough, or at least played enough by then, there's no way we'd keep him on.

However, not many strikers can double their tally in December <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

4372~~~
The player hasn't yet been born who can score goals when he hasn't got the ball.

4373~~~
How much is Costa worth then?

He can produce without service at times, he just hasn't really had a proper chance to.

4374~~~
What should he do, dribble past 5 players and score?

4375~~~
He saw plenty of the ball and did very little with it. 

Why do people seem to want to blame everyone and everything else then Falcao when he doesn't play well? 

Whats Costa got to do with anything?

That'd be nice, yes.

4376~~~
You just tell us what he got to do, what can a striker do when he doesnt get any service ( keep in mind that not everybody is Brazilian Ronaldo or Messi).

4377~~~
Haha this thread is funny, lad scores on his first start for ages and people are still not happy

4378~~~
Costa isn't worth the money Chelsea paid because he isn't Aguero? Do you see Costa running past 4 players before scoring? He's a finisher. He scores goals. That's worth a lot of money. 

£43 million isn't a lot for a world class striker. Which is exactly what Falcao is.

4379~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Wait. You are serious?

4380~~~
Just leave it mate, hes obviously clueless

4381~~~
He's got to play better. 

Costa cost Chelsea £13 million less, plus wages and loan fee, then what Falcao would cost us. He's also younger, and comes off a fantastic season.

4382~~~
I see I've offended the Falcao fan club again <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4383~~~
Costa is probably worth closer to £45 million now. He had a release clause.

I know you're still crying over Welbeck but you don't have to downplay Falcao because of it. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4384~~~
Not really, to be honest I'm just surprised that hes had his first start in a while after coming back from injury and hes scored us an important goal, yet all you can do is find criticism. It's actually kind of weird.

4385~~~
I'm not a Falcao fan either, but he played to his possibilities today imo, we cant expect Messi like things from him, he scored a goal and his overall play was good, for now I think he could hardly do more.

4386~~~
How many minutes did he play? He just had a first start in ages and scored a goal and you're here moaning..

4387~~~
Well, again, thats not true. If you read back through the thread you'll see a praised him for the header, which was fantastic.

4388~~~
Seems so, yeah.

4389~~~
You lot are insufferable. How dare anyone criticise the mighty Falcao. Its like a cult in here.

<a class="username" data-user="47354, @ItsEssexRob" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/47354/">@ItsEssexRob</a> was right.

4390~~~
You're criticising him for no reason though. He was far from poor today. You're blinded by your love for Welbeck. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

4391~~~
Sorry mate, you're posting some ridiculous stuff.

4392~~~
First Costa, now Welbeck. What have either of those to got to do with Falcao? Talk about straw men arguments. 

When was the last time I even mentioned Welbeck?

4393~~~
Its weird a United fan would criticize the player who got us a point today, there are plenty of players who deserve criticism today, not sure he is one of them.

4394~~~
Funny how I'm not the only who wasn't (goal aside) that impressed with Falcao today.

But as usual, we got the buzzwords from the Falcao fan club. 'Movement' 'Hold up play' 'lack of service'. Its all so predictable.

4395~~~
Costa doesn't meet the criteria for what is a £45 million player according to you. Costa is worth at least £40 million, and you cannot even argue against that. That's why that's relevant.
It's obvious you look for faults in Falcao because you're in love with Welbeck. That's why Welbeck is relevant.

4396~~~
What did you expect from him?
He got us a point as <a class="username" data-user="81416, @Cassidy" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/81416/">@Cassidy</a> said and there are other players who deserve more criticism. But as you expect him to dribble past numerous players and score (although he's not that kind of a player) its no wonder you're not impressed..

4397~~~
And I've criticised others as well. But ultimately, Falcao is the one on trial atm. He's the one that might end up cost us £50 odd million. 

So yeah, for that money, I have high expectations. Expectations that involve a bit more then just having good movement and holding the ball up well.

4398~~~
Except that he probably isnt that anymore. I do feel pretty confident with Costa in Falcaos place he would be getting more goals right now. ( obviously assuming they both played the same minutes.)

4399~~~
Costa wouldn't have scored more than the one today mate.

4400~~~
Again, when did I last even mention Welbeck?

4401~~~
If. We dont know what would have happened.

4402~~~
I doubt it tbh.

4403~~~
When he plays a few games post injury and gets a run in the team I'll make a judgement, I'm sure the club will too.
Have you forgotten RVPs form start of season, hes going to need couple of games to get going.

4404~~~
Not in this thread perhaps. I have seen you do it before though.

I also remember you claiming Welbeck is a better player than Rooney. I don't know if I should even be debating with someone with an opinion like that.

4405~~~
Once again, when was the last time I even mentioned Welbeck?

4406~~~
Now get him playing up there on his own. He needs his personal space.

4407~~~
You cant be serious, I doubt somebody with a brain would say that.

4408~~~
yeah <a class="username" data-user="65160, @iBoss" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/65160/">@iBoss</a> go ahead and find a post when Sam last mentioned Welbeck. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4409~~~
Why do you keep asking that? Why does that even matter? I get it, you like Welbeck. That doesn't mean you have to downplay our other forwards though. Which is exactly what you are doing with Falcao. If that's a poor game from Falcao when he's done most things right, I don't know what to say.

4410~~~
He looks almost impossible to dispossess at times. He's not a dribbler, but he's got better link-up and control than our other strikers. And that while being out of form. What has he got now, 2 goals and 2 assists out of 4 starts? Thats pretty good for an off-form striker.

4411~~~
I already have. Apart from a little wum post, the last time I properly mentioned him was November the 7th. Over a month ago.

But no, my blinding love for Danny is making me hate Falcao. Or something.

4412~~~
Oh so when I criticising RVP for playing poorly (along with the whole forum) was that down to my love of Welbeck too?

4413~~~
You havent answered my question. What did you expect from Falcao today? If not a goal and a movement and build up play which you laugh about.

4414~~~
He said he expected him to beat players on his own and score goals on his own.

4415~~~
RVP was actually playing poorly though. Falcao was far from poor today. Which is my point.

4416~~~
If that's true then he hasnt seen much of Falcao until he came to us. 
Sure he used to know how to score on his own but he's a proper CF first, a fox in the box, a player who will turn chances and half chances into goals. The best part is that his beloved Costa is a similar player.

4417~~~
I expect his whole game to be better. Faster, sharper, more skill on the ball. He also needs to fall over a lot less.

No I didn't.

Plenty of people agree with me that he was poor today.

4418~~~
I don't even like Costa ffs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This is exactly what I'm talking about. Falcao fans on here just resort to anything to prove a point. Its werid. Cult-like.

4419~~~
I actually like him very much, I really hope he makes it here (in a way some here have a soft spot for Mata). I think he did well today, his link up play seems to be quite good. I can see him working well with Di Maria as he attacks the ball like no other of our strikers does.

4420~~~
Costas all round play is better, whereas Falcao used to be deadlier. Difference is Costas play can look uglier at times.

At their peaks i'd say Falcao was the better technician and goalscorer from insane angles whilst Costa offers more to everyone and being in the right place at the right time. Right now though I think Costa would fit your team like a glove.

4421~~~
Well give him some time ffs. Its his first start since Leicester I think.

4422~~~
Similarly, I feel confident that with Falcao in Costa's place he would be getting goals right now.

4423~~~
You did. If you wont I'll find and quote your post.

4424~~~
How come, Costa needs service too.

4425~~~
Go on then.

4426~~~
I dont think Falcao was great today, not by the standards he is classed as here anyway, remember I watched him intensely for Atletico when he either tore us apart or tore up La Liga. Its like Mata and Hazard have been at times lately, a goal masking a rather average game.

4427~~~
I don't think Falcao was tackled once today, took the ball into feet calmly, found a pass and made effective runs towards the opposition goal. He had two chances today, one half chance, and the other was his goal. Falcao has good all round play and we've already seen that this season.

Never claimed he was great today, just that he wasn't poor like Sam is claiming.

4428~~~
You have service, I dont think he is as strong  as he used to be or as pacey. Watch the youtube compilations of  some of his goals for Madrid and Porto, a lot of them had barely any great service.

4429~~~
You must love Welbeck, Rob. Thats the only explanation for not thinking Falcao was amazing today.

4430~~~
Its good, but I dont think its Costas level, he is similar to Drogba in that battering ram approach to the role, except he seems even deadlier than the Ivorian.

4431~~~

4432~~~
Today he got service and he scored hasn't he.

4433~~~
Sarcasm doesn't come across very well on the internet does it?

4434~~~
He did, was a good header. Wasn't a great overall performance though, Costas had some of these. Looks like hes not in the game but still bags a goal or sometimes two so it all depends on whether he does this consistently enough.

4435~~~
Not when you're not very good at it.

4436~~~
If you thought that was a serious reply, then you're a bit thick tbh.

4437~~~
Well he had a 1st start since Leicester, played a few 20 minute games so lets give him time. He should start next few games and I'm sure he'll be better. As it was said here nobody said he was amazing but he hasnt been so poor as some want to prove here. 
He's a striker, he got us a goal, that's what strikers do and if they do it while not having a great game that's good also.

4438~~~
Proper mature reply. Get in. 
Next one is about my age I bet.

4439~~~
Yes he has, quite a few of late, whilst coming back from a hamstring injury... hmmm who else is coming back from injury...

4440~~~
About as mature as you calling me clueless, I'd suggest.

4441~~~
Since Everton* <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

4442~~~
You're right, and he scored that game too.

4443~~~
When did that happen exactly? 

Ah fe.k it, there's no purpose in this.

4444~~~
Everton sorry yes. And as Cassidy said he scored than too.

4445~~~
But did he dribble past 4 players before scoring though?

4446~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4447~~~
Exactly, Costas been nursing  an injury whilst scoring 12 EPL  goals. I just think hes lost that world class edge now, but still has the ability to be a good striker.

4448~~~
Those goals werent sharp enough.

4449~~~
Your actually missing my point, but anyway its like I said in the RVP thread you can't say a player has lost world class edge after watching him play 90 minutes all of twice, its just a bit silly

4450~~~
Did you make the same snap judgement on Benteke when he came back from injury? Because I tell you now, he looked a hell of a lot worse. In fact, I'd go as far to say that, that was the first game Benteke looked anywhere near his old self. Have some patience, he'll come good.

4451~~~
Was Costa out for six months with a serious injury? Before we signed him he had only played one pre-season game I think and was clearly not fully fit. He picked up a few other injuries along the way so I understand why Falcao hasn't been at his best for us, he's only made two starts though and I'm fully confident he will score a lot for us this season. It's hard to say yet if he's lost the 'world class edge' He just needs to stay fit, start games and we'll see how good he still is.

4452~~~
He said that even before the season started so.. I guess he wont change his mind even though Falcao hasnt played a lot.

4453~~~
Well no, since if anything it has become more apparent.

4454~~~
No it hasnt. Its ridiculous to write a player off so quickly.

4455~~~
Well during the mass love in session I  warned that he may not be the same player and his injury may be a problem, do you not agree what I said  has been true? I didnt say hes not worlds class anymore because he  just turned poor.

4456~~~
No. As I said its ridiculous to clam he's not wc anymore when he hasnt been playing a lot this season. Give him a run of games and will see. As I remember you claimed he's not wc anymore even though he just came back from a long injury and didnt even kick a ball for us.

4457~~~
And then I thought that Ekeke cannot be topped on this thread.

While I know that as a reply will come the inevitable 'I watch the game with my eyes' (like the subjective opinions of heavily driven agenda people are always exact), I'll post his stats from today:

1 Goal
100% shoot accuracy in goal
4 key passes
93% passing accuracy.

And while Van Persie was busy slowing the game every fecking time he got the ball, until all Aston Villa players, their mum's, cousins and dogs went near him, before he passed the ball sideways to Valencia; Mata was on Liam Miller's/Cleverley invisible mode and Wilson was running for the sake of it (or something like that) Falcao scored the goal (which gave us one point), linked well and didn't lose the ball often. But yeah, he was pants today.

4458~~~
Yeah.. But you know.. His game wasnt sharp enough and quick enough you know.. And stuff.

4459~~~
Not comparable at all. An ACL repair is huge challenge to return from. Can take a year to get back to their best. Remains to be seen if Falcao has lost his edge permanently but he's already shown he can do it once. It's definitely possible he can do it again.

4460~~~
The guy is coming back from an injury that requires 9-12months for a full recovery.  He scored today and played 90 minutes.  How anyone can divine anything about a permanent drop in form based on his play over the past 3 months is beyond me, as he was still in recovery mode and not getting a run of games.

I'm looking forward to seeing him play as a first team member now that he's recovered.  It'll take some games to integrate him into with the flow of play.  But at least he's now available to start.

4461~~~
<a class="username" data-user="28415, @Sam" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28415/">@Sam</a> talking smack again. Quite clear he's had an agenda against Falcao for a while.

4462~~~
Van Persie was stretching Villa, which is the reason he's been prefered all season. Its something Falcao needs to learn to do as it benefits the team and its what you need from your leading striker

4463~~~
And he was also slowing our game every time the ball went near him. Not to mention his refusal to pass the ball at-least twice when Falcao was in far better position (actually in one of those situation would have been in one on one with the keeper) and generally keeping the ball without doing anything with it until he got rounded by three Villa players and so was forced to pass it to Valencia.

I was glad he was taken off (though would have preferred Adnan instead of Wilson) because he was being extremely selfish and slowing every attack.

Also, the reason he has been preferred all season is a bit of nonsense considering that Falcao has pretty much started every game he was fit to play from the start.

4464~~~
The only 'agenda' I have is that, as of yet, he's done nothing remotely close to justifying a £43 million transfer at the end of the season. 

I'd absolutely love it if that was to change though, obviously.

4465~~~
Has anyone else got the feeling Falcao was ignored in the first half. He made himself avaible for the pass yet Rooney, Fletcher, Val played sideway passing among themselves.

4466~~~
Except for the 5 sub appearances that make up more than his starts?

4467~~~
Rooney tends to do this often, has had the same with RVP in the past.

4468~~~
They are rightfully jealous, they hear his song even when he is not here, and of course there is the hair and the watch.

4469~~~
RVP found him several times, Rooney, like Mata, preferred to pass the ball out wide and Fletcher was just useless in general out there. I don't think he was ignored, most players just made poor decisions in general.

4470~~~
This. With the caveat that he also scored a ghost hat trick during this rehabilitation phase for Colombia in a friendly in Miami. 2 goals were stolen from him on the line. 

Falcao is a monster and if we can get him back to the form he showed before, where he was comfortably the 3rd best player on the planet, then we'll all be glad for it. Enjoy the ride, cheer the goals and have patience.

4471~~~
Matches when he wasn't fit for 90 minutes.

4472~~~
Yeah but how much has he played? Not much did he. 
If he will have a run of games and will not come out good then surely we probably wont buy him. But we cannot judge him right now on the amount of games he played.

4473~~~
There were 24 different pass combinations registering more passes before Falcao features in the list. Carrick was the man that passed to him most btw, 6 times.

Falcao to Rooney is 35th on the list - 6 times.
Rooney to Falcao is 37th - 5 times.

RVP to Falcao was 3 times.
Mata to Falcao, once.

4474~~~
I thought RVP had passed him the ball more often than that, but then again you have to see it in relation to how often RVP actually had the ball, which wasn't that often. Carrick in general seemed to stabilize our midfield and make us more of a threat, so I'm not surprised there.

Either way, this doesn't prove that he was ignored rather than players deeming other options better in their opinions.

4475~~~
Yeah, for what it's worth I'm not arguing against you. I thought Falcao was excellent today personally. I'm just providing the stats.

4476~~~
Yeah, they see him in space and think "nah".

Soubds legit.

4477~~~
But was fit to play, hence doing so

Are you saying he's been fit to play 4 times all season? If so he can retire now

4478~~~
I'm just surprised to see how little RVP passed to him. I thought the two had decent chemistry together given that it was their first game in a while, but it seems like the eye test fooled me.

4479~~~
He hasn't been fit to start more games than he has started. By fit, I mean on Van Gaal's scale of fit, which seems to be way higher than other coaches.

He has also had last year a career threatening injury and now was a month off because of an another injury. Now that he is feet, we'll see how he do. I expect a lot of people to eat their words.

4480~~~
Gets a goal and people still aren't happy.

The Welbeck fan brigade are terrible.

4481~~~
Glad he got a goal today, needs to hit a run soon though.

4482~~~
Aye. Those stats prove differently but they don't give the entire context. Passes to other players may have been the better choices, other players in better space etc, at times when RVP had the ball there could have been defenders in the way making the route to Falcao an improbable pass choice etc etc etc.

Backs up the general tone that we simply failed to find our striker nearly enough though. Which we can all agree was the main problem today. Nothing came from the central midfield area at all. Was a poor showing from Rooney and Mata in general but that's for another thread.

4483~~~
He is pointing his finger at you <a class="username" data-user="28415, @Sam" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/28415/">@Sam</a>, that's for the doubters.
Look at hime how can anyone not like hime, wallah I have a man crush <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4484~~~
Look at that celebration. Its clear he celebrates differently, no like he used to when he was world class. His celebration looks rusty.

4485~~~
He also didn't dribble 5 opposite players during the celebration. Neither scored 4 headers. Sell him!

4486~~~
Not enough pace in the celebration, I expect a better celebration for £43M.

4487~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Nice one guys

4488~~~
Yup. Waste of space. Costa would have celebrated a lot better and would score a hattrick while doing it.

4489~~~
Yeah, expected some kind of acrobatics or kissing the camera or sthing. Gutted.

4490~~~
Need to get this guy up top through the middle supply him and he will score goals a plenty! Real class.

4491~~~
Surely the people trying to be funny don't actually think we should fork out 40 million for him based on what we've seen so far?

There's still half a season to go and hopefully he can kick on from here but we need to see much, much more before we should even consider it.

4492~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fecking hell guys it's like a class room in here..

I think I'm in love with Falcao. Proper man crush, can't wait for him to get a run going. Still find it had to believe we have players like Falcao and Di Maria at United. It's beautiful

4493~~~
STAT ALERT:

2 goals and 2 assists in 385 Premier League minutes. That's 4.2 matches. Good going by any strikers standards.

4494~~~
Can we expect a physical turn around ala RVP for Falcao? RVP looks a lot sharper and quicker in his movements than Falcao does. He also carries the ball at greater speed, but then turns back, takes a swivel, looks up, looks down, does a dance and passes the ball sideways. Falcao's link-up play is terrific, but he just looks like he's jogging out there, not sprinting at all. Anyone else got the same impression?

4495~~~
96 minutes per goal/assist - only Di Maria has been as productive. This is very impressive considering he wasn't fit half of the time and half of those minutes were in 10-15 minute cameos. 

I think the 90 minutes and the goal would do him a world of good. If he stays fit and keeps scoring/assisting with the same frequency I would have no complains to spend the £43M.

4496~~~
Not really, think he seems quick enough but his touch is not as sharp as usually. It's worth noting that we're rubbish at feeding our strikers, then again, that hasn't stopped RvP from impressing lately.

4497~~~
I don't think that his touch has ever been that great. However, when he stops the ball, then it is pretty hard to get the ball off him.

His strength has always been scoring goals. He was arguably the best finisher in the world during his time at Atletico, scoring from all positions with headers being his speciality. If he can only stay fit and our wingers will manage to cross to him (and also our other players to pass at him at times) he'll score for fun. Still a class player.

4498~~~
He definitely doesn't look as fast/sharp as he did in his Athletico days. He actually looks quite sluggish at times to me. As you say though, so did RVP a month or so ago. 

Although I'll probably be accused of being in love with Welbeck for daring to point this out.

4499~~~
We also have Fletcher (2014 version) and Evans (thought I'd bring you back to earth buddy)

4500~~~
Yeah cheers for that

4501~~~
if we spend 40m on Falcao or 30m on Strootman, there is no difference at this moment in time. Lets be honest here before saying he is past it, give him a proper run and see what he can do. Money doesnt matter too, there isnt a better striker out there than Falcao that we could get.

4502~~~
But the good news in Fern Cotton will be around your house in half an hour so get the lynx on!

4503~~~
There's no W in there, otherwise I could probably have made the word Welbeck from scrambling letters together, so yeah.

He's clearly a great player, but with him and RVP up front, we lack mobility. It won't help putting Rooney up there either, and Wilson isn't ready. We'll see when we have Di Maria firing on all cylinders again, and there is no doubt that Herrera would have improved the team.

I still think he looks a little sluggish, but more to the point that he doesn't really sprint into positions. RVP looks more eager when getting the ball, but he just takes a little too long at times.

4504~~~
Costa doesn't look anywhere near as good as he was last season. Still racking up the stats though.

4505~~~
Good to see him score. Hope he can start getting them regularly now.

4506~~~
I think falcao thrives on being the main striker in the team. To bring the best out of him, we have to play 1 up top. Let the midfielders feed him with plenty of ball into the box, he'll finish the job.

4507~~~
I fear we would never see the best of falcao in a United shirt, at least not at the level he used to be, as van gaal will always play with 2 strikers

4508~~~
Agree he needs to be the focal point through the middle and up top. This guy has goals all over him.

4509~~~
Happy for him, he needs to get a run of games now to find some form.

4510~~~
Fern cotton? Yuk

4511~~~
Lol was watching celebrity juice at the time of posting and she was looking hot. Lol shut up yuk are you waiting on a miss world or a super model coming along if so you better get the hankies ready!

4512~~~
I thought he held the ball up well under pressure and was always showing for the ball - even though tried our best to avoid him. He scored from the first quality ball into the box, and his general movement looked decent for his first game back.

Give him 5 games like rvp got and we will see the best of him I'm sure.

4513~~~
Pleased to see him get a goal. I just really hope he can stay fit this time and push on to get a load more goals.

4514~~~
It's a shame that Van Gaal never wants to drop Van Persie, not even just to give him a rest it seems. Because ideally I would want to see Falcao with Rooney just behind him and Herrera + Fellaini/Blind/Carrick in midfield. I know Van Persie has been scoring goals recently but if we are going to get any good use out of Falcao then Louis is going to need to start rotating the strikers. Playing all three is daft IMO and I feel sorry for Rooney being stuck back in CM. (Yes I realise we currently have injuries in that position, but Louis seems to want to accommodate both Rooney and RVP in every game).

4515~~~
Your eyes didn't fool you, when the pass is on they usually give it to each other.

4516~~~
Right, I'm going to ask this hopefully without people accusing me of being a 'hater' or whatever.

But does anyone else think he runs and moves slightly different now? And by that I mean, he doesn't look quite as balanced or in control as he did before. I've been watching quite a few videos of him from his Athletico days and his running style looks completely 'normal' (for want of a better description), but so far for us he doesn't quite look fully comfortable. I cant really describe it, but he always looks a bit off balance to me, like he's having to fight his body to do what he wants.

I'm guessing this might just be because he's coming back from ACL surgery, and I know people have said that when that happens players often over compensate on the other leg as to avoid strain on the 'injured' one.

4517~~~
I know what you mean, he's not as fluid in any movement he does. I've noticed that of Van Persie too, he runs and moves like he's ten years older than he is now.

4518~~~
Yeah thats it, he just doesn't look as fluid. Thank god its not just me that's noticed this! I really hope its something that will return back to normal in time.

Agree with RVP as well, although I think he's looked a lot better in that respect in the last weeks. A lot sharper and more comfortable.

4519~~~
I guess it's hard to tell from YouTube videos of his best moments. To truly be able to compare his balance and mobility, you'd probably have to watch a few of his full matches before the ACL injury.

4520~~~
Was a good goal that he scored.

4521~~~
Hopefully LVG will reward him for that goal by giving him more games. Fully deserves it, works hard getting fully fit, played a full game and got on the score sheet and when he scored, it showed how much it meant to him to get off the mark. That's what i like from players, passion and playing more for the shirt and the fans than the money itself. He could just sit on the bench most of the season and chat to Anderson on how great that they're getting paid by doing nothing, but he's working hard and inching to get more games and goals. I can tell he loves the support he is getting from the fans, and it is great to hear him say that he will pay the fans back by scoring more goals.

4522~~~
Indeed, but we should not rely on him to create things all on his own. he needs service, as does RvP. If they have creative players behind them to set them up, they both will score.

4523~~~
Good goal, will take him and RVP a bit of time to link up, thought I saw them making a few similar runs at times in the games. Thought Rooney had a chance to play him in a couple of times too and didnt.

4524~~~
Well thats bit obvious there my friend considering it is a team game (apologizes if i sound vague), and they do have the creative players behind them? Mata, Di Maria, Herrera, Rooney even Carrick if you count his long range passes. So im not really understanding your response to my post and how relevant to it? i didnt mention anything that Falcao has to create his own opportunity to score goals? If by meaning he'll repay the fans by scoring more goals, it solely means when the opportunity opens up for him to score a goal, he will do his up most best in his ability to put that ball in the net from who ever provided it for him.

4525~~~
I actually agree with your post and was planing to write that, but early morning no coffee mode was still active and I screwed it up a little. sorry mate.

4526~~~
Yeah we need to be more direct with our passes. Di Maria will offer us that now that he is back. At times players don't seem willing to make that killer pass that will take us 30 yards up the pitch.

4527~~~
His movement in the box is very good.  Problem on Saturday was he went looking for the ball  a little too much but you cant blame him for wanting to get involved.  The guy genuinely looks like he wants to make it here. 

With Di Maria and Herrera in the side im sure you will see Falcao's performances improve.

4528~~~
I've just noticed that of his 4 starts so far this season (or to put it another way, the 4 times he's played for more than a 25min cameo appearance) he has 2 assists and 2 goals to his name (vs Leicester, West Ham, Everton and Villa).

Considering his lack of match fitness, that's a decent return imo. His stats certainly look worse because of those cameo appearances, where he's brought on in a game where we're sitting back on a lead, or are trying to break down a parked bus.

4529~~~
i really want him to succeed, but the team isnt helping matters with little creativity

4530~~~
He's runs are as good if not better than RVP's, and that's one of the strongest aspects of RVPs game. Incredible that we have these two talented strikers and can't use them, we cannot create.

4531~~~
Definitely. His return is good considering the amount of football he has actually played in. 

His total accumulated minutes for United this season (including all the 10-20 minute sub appearances) equals 385 minutes, which just about equates to four lots of 90 minutes. 2 goals and 2 assists in 4x90 minutes is nothing to be scoffed at. It's a goal or assist per game.

Hopefully he can get a run in the side and notch a few more. He looked to be close to 100% on Saturday. He was running hard and using his body against defenders. Certainly didn't look too cautious. If he could get 15 goals, that'd be pretty decent. I think he's got it in him to get more than that, if he can be a regular starter.

4532~~~
His movement off the ball is some of the best I've seen. Sublime. Hopefully the Villa game was a precursor of whats the to come for him. He should be starting every game now that he's 100% fit. 

Obnoxious formation incoming;

4533~~~
I noticed this while looking at my Fantasy League team.  He has the 7th best points-per-start in the Premier League, whihc isnt too shoddy.

4534~~~
If I'm honest that's where I noticed it too! I was looking at selling off Rooney if he's going to be playing deeper and Falcao is conveniently about the same price... Must be fate.

4535~~~
Yeah, its obviously not the best way to judge, but there are a few videos on there of his match performances from his days in La Liga, that show all his touches and whatnot, not just his goals.

And I can definitely see a noticeable difference in his movement and running style.

4536~~~
Shouldn't be on the pitch at the same time as RvP. It completely unbalances the team, especially with a third striker in CM.

One of Falcao or RvP should be leading the line with Rooney or Mata behind.

How this isn't being brought up by pundits or more fans even is beyond me.

4537~~~
I really do think we should use him more around the box to feet. He is as strong as an ox and his low centre of gravity is tevez style. I notice we rarely used him when he dropped deep, which I think is what our team doesnt do enough on the edge of the box.

4538~~~
Possibly because its only happened twice maybe?

4539~~~
Falcao and RvP have only been on the pitch together twice this season? Pay closer attention.

And this issue of playing two number 9s and a third striker in midfield that you're being so blasé and dismissive over right now is something you'll soon be whinging about.

Van Gaal clearly doesn't see it as RvP OR Falcao, he sees it as RvP and Falcao up front with Rooney in CM and ADM on the wing. If you can't see that yet, fair enough, but by the end of January I guarantee you more and more people will be seeing the detrimental effect that I'm talking about.

4540~~~
They have only started two games together upfront.
When Falcao has come on when we're either chasing a game or for him to get minutes/match fitness when the game is over shouldn't really be used as a barometer.

I'm not 100% sure the partnership would work myself but I wouldn't write it off after 2 games.

EDIT: Also considering the first game they started together they actually played relatively ok together and Falcao has provided RVP with 2 assists.

4541~~~
They've played enough together for me to see that they're at least <i>very unlikely</i> of forming a partnership that's fluid, functional and conducive to us playing better as a team. They're both number 9s for goodness' sake! They're both slow!

It's weird to see Van Gaal of all people trying to shoehorn them both into the starting 11 when it goes against pretty much everything he's done in his career previous.

Playing with two goalkeepers would ensure that you let fewer goals in - but you'll be playing with 10 men everywhere else.

4542~~~
Or 9 even!

I've been impressed with some of their link up play. Some of the play in the QPR game and RVP's goal vs Leicester were very promising signs. They're no Cole and Yorke but look more likely to work than Rooney/RVP which should but just never has.

4543~~~
As you say, they're both 9s. I really can't see any sort of partnership forming. The fact is that they've both spent their whole lives looking up to see where the goal is. They've got a selfish streak that has got them to where they are today so anyone that thinks they're suddenly going to be threading the ball through the box or running wide to create space for the other is very naive. They want the ball and they want to use the space themselves because they're born goal scorers.

4544~~~
The fact they're both nr. 9s doesn't mean they cant form a partnership up front. And if they will form it or wont cant be judged on just 2 games...

4545~~~
--------Carrick--Blind----------
---Herrera-------Di Maria-----
------------Rooney-------------
------------Falcao--------------

Wonder if this could work? Too congested in the middle?

4546~~~
I would preferably use a proper winger on the right, either Valencia/Young/Januzaj, and then move Herrera next to Carrick. Both Blind+Carrick together would be too static and would want to do similar jobs IMO. 

Apart from that though I think Rooney and Falcao could make a brilliant partnership.

4547~~~
Think Januzaj could work. Just a bit wary of it becoming a flat 4411 if Valencia goes out there. I think Herrera would thrive being able to exploit the space made by Di Maria.

4548~~~
Having watched Falcao in the Calderon a good few times I can confirm his running style is slightly different. But it is not surprising based on the injuries he has had.

Running style aside though, I think it's going to take him a few more months to get back to his true best form, and this is starting games to. The wishy washy substitute appearances won't work with him, He isn't an impact sub type guy. He needs to be starting games, like any true number 9 really.

For what it's worth I thought he played quite well on Saturday, which I wasn't expecting as he looked pretty poor in his previous sub appearances recently. Let's hope he starts now on Boxing Day and gets a good run in the team going forward. Some of the general 'hating' on him in this thread is astounding really, can't help but feel these people want players to fail here so they can brag to their Twitter buddies that they predicted it.

4549~~~
I really hope he starts against Newcastle. He is going to be fresh and roaring to kick on after his injury. I can see newcastle's defense getting bamboozled by his movement, I just hope we can provide the service.

4550~~~
Except this is exactly what we have seen happen quite a few times when they have been on the pitch together...

4551~~~
Do you not think a coach as experienced as Van Gaal realises they are similar players, and is coaching them to play together as a partnership, and not as two individuals? I'm sure he's not telling both of them to go out there, play their natural game and chase the same balls, make the same runs and get in each others way, and then scratching his head on the sidelines, bemused as to why it's happening.

4552~~~
He's going to score tomorrow <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4553~~~
Yeah i'd like to see them play as a partnership at some point, think Falcao would be a great partner for Rooney and would give him more space in the number 10 role, like Hernandez did in the 10/11 season.

4554~~~
I think he will start against Newcastle and Stoke with Wilson starting against Tottenham.

4555~~~
Quality player but we won't see the best of him until he has a run of games. It's unfortunate as already said, we can't seem to be able to get the right players on the pitch at the right time.

4556~~~
Today, you mean

4557~~~
Van Gaal has recognised that he needs better supply if he is going to score lots of goals which is encouraging. Hopefully he will put them out with instructions to feed more balls though and look for the earlier pass. Too often the strikers have made the run only for our midfielders to hesitate and end up recycling the ball. 

Time to start looking to get them in early.

4558~~~
To be fair, if he is in the US, it would be tomorrow at the time he posted.

4559~~~
In terms of minutes on the clock and particularly starts it's early but I do have this nagging feeling that Falcao's never going to be at his best again. 

I sincerely hope he'll prove me wrong because I'd love to see a fit and firing Falcao lead the line for us.

4560~~~
Oh, he's lively today isn't he? Joy to watch. Like T*vez (spit) in his first season. All over the pitch.

4561~~~
He's class, I love watching him.

4562~~~
RVP looks a different man with Falcao up front compared to with Rooney. Their diverting runs has been amazing and Rooney has really thrived at bombing forward in to that open space.

4563~~~
His workrate has been so good. Tackles, helps in defending. Reminded me of Tevez on his days at OT.

4564~~~
♫ <i>Lolololololololo
Radamel Falcao
Lololololololo
Lololololololo
Radamel Falcaoooo</i> ♫

4565~~~
So, ummm, I guess Mata, RvP, Rooney and Falcao can play together.  Nice movement and awareness between all of them. And Rooney scoring two from MF-one in front of goal.  Great fluidity.

4566~~~
And people think he may not be here next season?

4567~~~
So much better today. Played a key role in both goals.

His touch for Rooneys goal was utterly brilliant. Made it look so easy, when it really wasn't.

4568~~~
This guy is going to be here for the next few seasons. Getting towards full fitness and is looking great.

Let's hope he can get a goal.

4569~~~
Impressive work rate and attitude. But he needs goals. Lots and lots of goals

4570~~~
Involved in both goals and having a good all round game, hope he gets a goal in the second half.

4571~~~
Terrific so far. Almost unplayable. Tearing apart that newcastle back four almost singlehandedly. Love the synchronized runs him and RVP are making. Its causing all sorts of problems and opening up gaps for the likes of Rooney/Mata to run right through.

Deserves a goal today and no doubt he will get one if we continue this way in the second half.

4572~~~
Shit seems to happen going forward whenever he's on the pitch for whatever reason.

4573~~~
loving him in a united shirt, really starting to look the business

4574~~~
Hoping he grabs a goal or two. Class assist for Rooneys first. He's been a bit unlucky with some efforts this season so hopefully he can get on a run.

4575~~~
That assist to Rooney was absolutely fantastic.

4576~~~
Not sure he deserves that much praise?

Or am I being a Scrooge?

4577~~~
Falcao really gives everything for the shirt. He's literally been throwing himself about out there. Impressive number of assists he has now, given how little he's played. A reflection of how hard he tries to get involved I think. Hope he gets a goal.

4578~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Oh God.

4579~~~
You will be visited by three ghosts after the game.

4580~~~
Lol pmsl

4581~~~
No, thats OTT.

He's been very good though.

4582~~~
Looks far far more relaxed now. Good signs

4583~~~
Great assist. The awareness and then the skill to pick him out was unreal. 

Think he's a much better allround player than he gets credit for. Also he works his bollocks off.

4584~~~
His run (and of course the great ball) makes the first goal. Lost the defender with ease

4585~~~
Biggest thing that will determine whether we sign him is his fitness. Clearly class on the pitch and getting better every game, just a matter of if he can recover fully from the injury or if he stays injury prone.

4586~~~
Looking sharp today, hope he gets the goal his performance so far has deserved.

4587~~~
Works his balls off unselfishly for a guy playing for a move.

4588~~~
Should of kept him on

4589~~~
His assist was ridiculously good. Made it look easy.

4590~~~
It was a good hour for him. If he gets another hour at Spurs and Stoke it'd be better than missing Spurs to get 90 at Stoke. The game was won.

4591~~~
Very good performance I thought. Shame he was subbed but this will keep him fresh for Spurs.

4592~~~
Bit of a scrooge! He hasn't been getting on the end of too much but RVP and him have made the runs you expect from a world class striker duo to do. At a level that RVP/Rooney never nearly reached, which isn't weird as Rooney doesn't excel at runs that tears the opponents apart. 

Which is why it has looked so well suited today. Falcao and RVP's runs created space for Mata and Rooney still had space centrally in a way he doesn't often have. 

It is one game, against Newcastle, which means nothing really but still a very good game from the front four with all of them getting an assist/goal and playing great in the same game. 

Wouldn't mean too much if that had been customary but we've had to accept one or at a few rare times two of them playing at their best in one match at most. 

The positive thing today was that we didn't rely on any randomness in the goals either it was just great goals. No deflection, corners, free kicks or blind crosses.

4593~~~
Made sense to take him off, hopefully points to him started on Sunday.

4594~~~
Not scoring that many goals isn't a problem for him.

He's making thousand other things right and showing his indisputable quality.

4595~~~
He is very strong. At one point he was surrounded by 3 Newcastle players but still held on to the ball.

4596~~~
He's pretty fecking strong ain't he.

Hope he starts on Sunday, had a brilliant understanding with Rooney and RVP.

4597~~~
Reminds me of Tevez's role in 2007/2008, bullying the defence, scoring, assisting, absolute team player. What a monster!

4598~~~
Even if he didn't score, I loved his performance. Worked so hard and combined so well with the others.

4599~~~
Very good today. Only thing missing was a goal. Mind you he had some good chances from young's crosses.

4600~~~
It is when you are playing for a 40 million plus transfer

I think he genuinley wants to be at the club and looks like he is trying to prove himself to utd. But goals will be required

4601~~~
Very good overall and played a key part in both of our goals. I'm guessing he was substituted to get an early rest for Spurs.

4602~~~
Good game from him and this time when he came off he looked contented, like he knew the plan was get a 3rd and then come off so he'd be ready as we play again in under 2 days. He showed tenacity and strength and his movement opens up space for others, now we just need him to get motoring on the goal trail!

4603~~~
Good stuff from him today! I hope to God he starts against spuds and not wilson!

4604~~~
They will come, he's doing everything right so far.

4605~~~
That assist was amazing. To notice Rooney making the run in the corner of his eye and then make a perfectly directed and weighted pass across while sliding for the ball was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4606~~~
Very good performance today. Gonna start with Spurs for sure.

4607~~~
Should have got himself a goal or two but got an assist and is building up his fitness. A big performance against Spurs will get him going hopefully.

4608~~~
Contributes to a goal in every start he makes. Can't complain.

I do like his attitude, he seems to really enjoy being at United.

4609~~~
Or just start Wilson and Falcao and rest RVP?

4610~~~
He does

His attitude seems great so far and that's what we want

4611~~~
A bit unlucky not to have scored from one of those Young's crosses I think.

4612~~~
He's a real honest pro and we're lucky to have him. Works so hard for the team and he's gelling pretty well with our other attackers right now. 

I'd like to see more chances falling his way.

4613~~~
no

4614~~~
He seems do right things I don't worry about his goal tally right now,it will certainly improve as season progress.

4615~~~
I really like him.

4616~~~
Did really well and i expect him to get a LOT better with match time and getting used to the team and league.

4617~~~
I love him, honestly proper player crush.

4618~~~
I'd sign him just for that chant

4619~~~
One can nearly sense now that it's only a matter of time he sticks the peddle to the floor and takes off and once he does we'll be in for some treat.

4620~~~
Me too, I was briefly devastated when LVG subbed him off today as I wanted him to score that badly <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. He was very good today though, and the assist to Rooney was superb.

4621~~~
Say it every week, I had no idea this guy could actually play. If he stays injury-free, buy him. Give him what he wants. 

He's starting to remind me of Tevez before he turned into a knob. Really helps us with the way he squeezes the opposition from the front.

4622~~~
This chant, what's it in tune with? Haven't been to OT yet this season and can't really make it out on TV

4623~~~
Love the way OT appreciates his efforts as well. We can't stop chanting his name, can we? How he must feel from moving to play in front of under 10K people to over 75K people chanting his name!

4624~~~
Excellent today. I was really hoping he was going to score, done everything else bar that. Hopefully start in the next game and grab the goal he deserves

4625~~~
We actually got a new Welbeck, instead of a goalscoring machine. He does everything, but doesn't score. I am quite sure the goals will come, but it is a bit funny.

4626~~~
He's probably my third favorite player (after De Gea and Rafael) despite being here for only 2 minutes. Terrific attitude and a great player.

4627~~~
I was a little dissapointed he was taken off but in retrospect that was a positive sign that Van Gaal appreciated how much he contributed and wants him fit for the next game so can't risk him. I don't really care about his goal tally to be honest, he's a team player, I don't think number of goals will be that important when deciding to sign him, just his fitness record.

4628~~~
He has played only 420 minutes and has scored twice (and made three assists). It is too early to say that he doesn't score.

4629~~~
I have a genuine man crush on him

4630~~~
He had a lot of chances, you can't deny that, even today. 

I know that it's early, it's not only the time he played, but also his roles at the beginning of the season and I did say that I do think that the goals will come, but for now he is doing what Welbeck did (and I really rate Welbeck, so it's not a complaint) instead of scoring.

4631~~~
He's doing far better than Welbeck and actually 5 goals/assists in 420 minutes (which is less than playing 5 games entirely) are decent stats. One goal/assist for 85 minutes, coming back from a terrible injury and being on a new league is decent.

And once he gets settled here, we will see a lot of goals from the Tiger.

4632~~~
He didn't play as a winger, like Welbeck did, we can only compare the stats when Welbeck played as a striker, so....

I agree with what you say about the future, but for now we got something no one was actually expecting. When the goals come, he'll be even better, that's all fine, but the goals are not here right now, that's what I am talking about.

4633~~~
I think this point is overlooked by many. Granted he has got real quality it still takes some players a while to adapt to the wing, i'd say strikers are affected more by it.

Still he looks a bit rusty in front of goal but his overall contribution is good.

4634~~~
Some people joke but they would take it up the bum for Falcao. I'm glad he was taken off because it just felt like it wasn't his day. On another day he'd walk off with a hat trick. Besides, after 60 odd minutes we took our foot off the peddle and it was better to give him the rest for Sunday. It's not important for him to get the forth goal. I'd rather he get the winner against Spurs.

4635~~~
He didn't score today, but for me it was quite easily his best performance for us so far.

4636~~~
Living up to his "Good Tevez" nickname at the moment.
But does need the goals to come, that was always a bugbear with Tevez.

4637~~~
I like him a lot, we just need to get his fitness up and he will be flying.

4638~~~
He deserved a goal today, needs to work on his first touch but I'll put that down to rustiness.

4639~~~
He was great today, really happy for him. I think him and rvp up top can work really well together. They open up so much space for the central players when they make thier wide runs.

4640~~~
It's fine playing two number 9s against a poor Newcastle side, but it isn't the way forward for us in the long run. Falcao and RvP are too slow and too similar to be troubling elite opposition - which is what our aim and direction should be.

I like Falcao, but people are going way overboard with everything he does of note. Unless he starts showing bonafide 'world beater' form, there's no way we should be paying any more than 30m for him in the summer.

4641~~~
great assist however he could have scored three from all the crosses he just missed. Would have been awesome if he could have.

4642~~~
Really happy with him today; adds a lot to the attack. 

Fitness is improving, made sense to remove him today with the game already won, got to start at Spurs

4643~~~
God, his running is different gear. so clever. Can't wait until the team get used to him, they will find him in some amazing positions.

Was really looking forward to seeing him live and it didn't disappoint. Really hope he starts against Tottenham and that's why he went off early.

4644~~~
His movement really is amazing. If we were the Utd of 3 or 4 years ago when we used to create a ton of chances nearly every game, i can only imagine the amount of goals Falcao would score.

4645~~~
He truly is the Handsome Tevez I said all along.

4646~~~
Got to keep him, he obviously hasn't hit the heights we may have hoped but I don't see us getting a better striker than him in the summer

4647~~~
Put in a good shift defensively and got a good reaction when he was taken off. Hopefully he keeps improving as his fitness builds.

4648~~~
Work rate was immense today imo. Properly battled for the ball.

4649~~~
Love the guy. Not sure if he's worth the figures mentioned but he's a class player.

4650~~~
If he stays fit from now until the end of the season, i think we'll sign him. He's doing the right stuff, and he will score i'm sure of it. For me, injuries were always the main cause for trepidation with his transfer.

4651~~~
Good shift today, would let him cock & bum me any match day.

4652~~~
Do you really think that what he showed today, and has shown thus far merits a £45m transfer...?

I'm not meaning to sound sarcastic with that - I like Falcao and I want him to succeed here. But I really think he's going to have to show a lot more than this. I mean, Diego Costa went for 30m, Sanchez for 35m and so Falcao needs to be having that kind of impact!

I don't really think thus far he's offered much more than Welbeck would've done if we'd kept him. That's not to say I don't think Falcao's a superior talent - his career thus far shows that he is - but the PL is a fast, physical league and we saw with, say, Shevchenko at Chelsea, being class through your whole career doesn't mean that you'll adapt to the Prem.

Hopefully I'm wrong and he goes on a mental scoring run soon. But like I said before, the type of impact he needs to be having to merit a 45m transfer is a Costa/Sanchez type impact.

4653~~~
tbf he has only started these 2 matches right? 

Think he will be well worth the price.

Looks such a strong footballer. He has everything.

4654~~~
The only reason he hasn't impacted like them is because he was injured. He scored two and assisted 3 in his first 5 games for us before he got injured. 

He's an absolute world class talent. His fitness it the only question mark and don't worry about the £45m fee, let the money men worry about that, they will have done the figures and offset it with how much he can earn us off the field and how his status can only be good for the club image.

4655~~~
indeed

4656~~~
You must be suffering from the ol latin crush! Brown sugar.

4657~~~
Big difference. Welbeck used to get on the chances often and fail to put them away, Falcao is missing out on getting to the end of chances. Falcao doesn't have an issue with poor finishing, he has an issue with match rhythm because of fitness.

4658~~~
I don't think that's a fair comparison at all. Sanchez has 1832 minutes for Arsenal, Costa has 1572. Falcao just 450. Half of which came from the bench. To score 2 and assist 3 whilst regaining fitness and without the benefit of match momentum like the others is pretty good. 

As for the game, he's getting sharper all the time. It was a clear step up from his previous performance, and i'm sure we'll see him involved again on sunday. I just don't think it's that fair to judge him against the likes of Sanchez and Costa yet, but when he has been involved he's done very well. Does that constitute laying down a huge sum like 45m for him? Again, we'll have to see how he does.

As for the Welbeck comparison by the way, 6 goals in 1652 minutes is hardly ground breaking. And that's from a guy that was gutted when he was sold.

4659~~~
He always seems on the cusp of falling over whenever someone challenges him but never quite does. A bit like Rafael.

4660~~~
He's a tenacious little fecker isn't he?

4661~~~
Love his attitude, strength and movement. So reliable on the ball.

4662~~~
I get where you're coming from and agree with you to an extend; but don't you think you're overdoing it by talking about the same issue in every single thread?

4663~~~
Actually, this is not true about Welbeck, just look at the stats in the last season.He didn't miss many chances, the problem is that he didn't get into to many while playing as a winger, so when you miss 2 from it's actually a big deals, when you miss 6 from 9 it's still the same ratio, but you got 3 goals, which is good if it's in 3-4 games.

This season Falcao is actually missing chances (look at at the Everton game, WBA, QPR), yesterday he did not get to the ball, but he should have).

And again I know what kind of finisher he is, everybody does, so he needs to find form, but for me it's funny as LVG said Falcao gets one chance and he scores, while Welbeck doesn't, and during this season we actually got a new Welbeck (but who plays as a striker, not a winger, so gets into more chances). 

Of course we all know what is Falcao probably gonna give us and yes, he is a better striker then Welbeck (or should be), but he is a better striker then most strikers today.

4664~~~
Definitely not. And that's not a criticism of him either. He's looked quality to me so far but he is, for me, a) not playing enough/frequently enough and b) too old. If you spend 45 million on a player (if that's his pricetag) you should get a Di Maria or Sanchez at an age when they are still some way away from the years footballers tend to decline. 

Having said that, from the little bit he's played, and it's hard to judge him on that, he does look a quality striker.

4665~~~
He's 28. Di Maria's 26. Not much of a difference in this day and age, the question marks would be about the extent of his recovery from the knee injury.

My verdict so far: Not the touch of a top class striker nor the required turn of pace to get away from defenders. Could be sharpness he lacks but he just doesn't ooze class the way say someone like Di Maria or RvP does.

If he's going to score lots of goals, he's utterly, utterly dependant on good service. Play him as the frontman in a team with the likes of Di Maria and Rooney behind him and he'll obviously get you goals.

But I don't think he's the player he once was. He's working hard I'll give him that but on current evidence I would say a year on loan's good enough - get in someone younger with pace to burn to give us versatility.

4666~~~
classy, classy player.

4667~~~
He probably has a lot more goals to score before he'll be here next season but so far I actually enjoy watching him play, long may it continue.

4668~~~
He needs to get back to his best and that'l happen with game time. Before his injuries, he was probably the best no 9 in the world. Sensational player. He's lacking sharpness which is inevitable after the injury he had and his start stop stint here due to competition. His movement is on another level, strikers like him dont need brute pace.

4669~~~
the last United player i was always so desperate hoping to score in every of our game was van nistelrooy. and usually he always did.

now it's falcao.

4670~~~
The £45mil figure includes the £10mil loan fee right?.
Besides i reckon we will get him slightly cheaper, well if Madrid or no one else comes in for him. He won't be going back to Monaco, thats for sure.

4671~~~
His overall play has been impressive. But I am still waiting on him to show how clinical he actually is.

4672~~~
Yep, think the same. Unless another club comes in, if we want him, we'l get him and wont really need to pay 45mil more.

4673~~~
I don't know which Welbeck you've watched last season. He missed quite a number of chances. Out of top of my head I remember when he tried to chip Neuer in a 1 on 1 situation. It was totally ridiculous and may have costed us the match.

This season Welbeck as a striker isn't proving anything either. What? 3 goals from 14 matches or something? Falcao, unfortunately, has spend most of his time here injured. The rest he has been taken off at the 60 min mark and hasn't been able to play properly. The chances he missed against WBA and QPR were not down to him at all. He hit the net, but a defender came at the last minute and saved it. That's not down to Falcao at all.

4674~~~
That's why I mentioned two reasons. If you're buying Fabregas for that fee at 28 then okay its worth thinking about but not if he's haf injury issues before your club and barely played at your club.

I think the 45 million is probably just a fee that's stuck. Doubt he'll actually cost so much.

4675~~~
No way will be it be 45mil more unless we're fighting for his signature with a Real Madrid. 

We've already paid 10mil for the loan, think it'l be another 25-30mil more tops specially considering Falcao would do his utmost to stay than go back to Monaco.

4676~~~
It just seems unnecessary to me personally when we have rvp and Rooney can play there too. Rather we spend big on a top wide player and defender.

4677~~~
Depends on where LvG sees Rooney long term. The way he goes on about his qualities as a midfielder and his "lung capacity", think he might play there consistently specially now that he's been made captain. Also, if we play 2 upfront long term, we need 3 top strikers + Wilson. So if we let Falcao return, we need to buy another one.

Defender is a must, yes but wide player? Depends on whether we intend to go to a 4-2-3-1 again. With Nani coming back, we might not need another one. I think specially with our current options, the diamond should be the way forward.

4678~~~
I so desperately want him to score <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> When RVP and Rooney are in the goals, I'm like "pass the ball to Falcao!". 

His general play is fantastic - building a nice combination between him, RVP, Rooney and Mata. Add Di Maria in the mix somewhere and we have a front 5 that could match any team. 

Plus, he is such a beautiful man.

4679~~~
He's stupendous. When he's fully fit and gets a run of games he'll be a 30 goal a season striker easily. 

I want to keep him for the song alone. Lo lo lo lo lo lo!

4680~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/016/151/tumblr_inline_n327sfUDU01r3x7o0.jpg" src="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/016/151/tumblr_inline_n327sfUDU01r3x7o0.jpg"/> 

I love looking back on these comments.

4681~~~
He appears to be fitting into the team very well. Nice assist for the first Rooney goal

4682~~~
I really enjoy watching him play - he's already my new favorite player! However, I would be vary of paying 45m for a 28 year old unless that number includes the loan fee that we have already paid. Then I'd just go for it and Falcao could eventually replace RvP as our experienced striker.

4683~~~
He's got 3 assists and 2 goals in 420 minutes whilst coming back from a horrific injury and settling into a new team and league. What more do you want from him? At least wait till he's back to full fitness and has settled in a bit more before you start dishing out the criticism on him.

4684~~~
Do people really have to keep banging on incessantly about wether or not Falcao has shown enough 'thus far' to warrant us paying his fee? He's only has a few games, give him a chance. He's certainly shown that he still has quality, only question is what level of fitness he can achieve.

4685~~~
Exactly.

4686~~~
Very intelligent, said a few weeks ago how his positioning and awareness of Van Persie is of a completely different class. Think it was against Stoke where he replaced Wilson and it was like night and day watching how they took up positions on the pitch, Van Persie was very much in Falcaos thoughts whereas the youth of Wilson saw him getting in a Robins way on quite a few occasions. 
The emergence of Rooney getting into the spaces our front two create with the movement is something of a bonus, fairly obvious when you see it now and if we can include Di Maria into that quartet then fcuk me. 
Get it firing and get some consistency at the back then I really think Chelsea are going to need that 10 point lead.

4687~~~
Too much focus on fees in general. Most criticism aimed at Fellaini will mention the £27.5million at some point as well. It's tiresome.

Falcao has barely even got going, yet he's still delivering a decent return. He's played exactly 450 minutes, according to Transfermarkt. That equals 5 full 90 minute matches in total. He's contributed 5 goals (2 goals and 3 assists) in the equivalent of 5 games. Is that not a good return? His overall play has also been very good, especially today and against Villa.

If, by the end of the season, he still has a record of roughly 1 goal (goal or assist) per game, then I'd say he's done enough to warrant a permanent move here.

4688~~~
His movement is on a different level; reminds me of Ruud. I hope he can get back to proper fitness, because if he does then he could easily be the best out-and-out striker in world football -- as he was for Atletico.

4689~~~
Exactly, when you buy a player outright you buy them based on what they have done in the past, you don't judge them on a selected injury period.

4690~~~
I'm delighted with him. We've struggled to find the right chemistry between RvP and Rooney, let alone either of those with Betbatov/Chicharito/Welbeck/Wilson, yet here we have someone who looks a brilliant fit for both. And with two strikers showing such compatible movement (let alone three with Rooney in midfield) Mata is starting to look the player we wished for.

Brilliant. feck the money, who cares?

4691~~~
Was brilliant.. I know people are going on about the fee,but if the club seem to think its worth it then I am going to enjoy listening to his chant at OT..<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> No way will he want to go back to the lifeless stadium in Monaco after this,I expect him to fight tooth and nail for this transfer to be made permanent..

4692~~~
Definitely ain't me.

4693~~~
I absolutely disagree with your assessment that Falcao's current form is resembling Welbeck's in any way. Lets compare their productivity in the EPL:

This season even with his injuries and little cameos here and there Falcao is still currently our most productive player with 90 minutes per goal or assist. Di Maria is second with 96 minutes per goal or assist. Rooney is third with 101 minutes per goal or assist.

Welbeck on the other hand has clocked the impressive 263 minutes per goal or assist this season. Here are his stats for the last 4 seasons:
2013/14 - 146 per goal or assist
2012/13 - 258 per goal or assist 
2011/12 - 155 per goal or assist
2010/11 - 253 per goal or assist

So no matter what you might think about his form - Falcao is still scoring/assisting at a rate that was never achieved by Welbeck in the past and I frankly doubt it will ever be achieved by him.

4694~~~
And this is Falcao not fully fit... as much as a I liked Welbeck, the gulf in class is evident.

4695~~~
He sort of did yesterday. The question remains how this lot would fare against top notch opposition, though. I still don't see any true fluency to the Mata-Rooney-RVP-Falcao combo other than in flashes, so to speak - and I keep thinking it won't ever properly work unless we manage to assemble a far less vulnerable team behind them. Against a dubious opponent - sure. They'll punish a pushover with their eyes closed - but it ain't truly <i>convincing</i>, is it?

4696~~~
Those + ADM + Herrera offer superb options. Blind also needs to come back as defender and/or Carrick backup. Rafael/Shaw...

Get Strootman and a couple of defenders who can actually defend in a trio and we are laughing. Just add a bit more midfield steel against the likes of Chelsea and City.

4697~~~
On top of what Momochiru said, with regards to stats for "Welbeck not missing many chances", his shots on target to shots ratio this season playing for the most part as a number 9 is about 40%. Falcao is at 44.5%, and for reference Diego Costa is at 47.5% and Aguero 48% . The stats don't tell the entire picture of course, but it does give an idea of how Falcao/Welbeck have done been with chances on goal.

4698~~~
Aye - I agree there's no shortage of options in there. Which is a damn good thing, be it said. But it won't matter until we sort out that bit in bold.

Still, I did like the look of us at times yesterday - in particular how Rooney and Mata worked off Falcao. There's potential there for something extremely powerful - something which anyone will find it hard to defend against.

4699~~~
it'd be brave to lineup with Falcao, VP, Rooney and Mata in the same lineup!

But would be interesting

4700~~~
Didn't that happen, like, 30 hours ago?

4701~~~
I bet he meant against better team like Tottenham.

4702~~~
Loved his assist for the first Rooney goal. Loved his tackle for the second. Thought his performance deserved a goal. His movement and hold-up play were typically excellent. He's so strong. Sometimes he seems to take a 'big' first touch and you think he's going to lose the ball but he always manages to keep possession. I love him, and I think he's going to be even better in the second half of the season once he gets a run of games and some consistency. I am also a tad concerned about his fitness/fee but I'll just enjoy him whilst he's here and see what happens in the summer.

4703~~~
in a tough away game I mean!

4704~~~
I still believe what Di Maria offers to the team will ultimately be the difference between a United that I want to watch and one that I have to out of obligation. I think I was a lot less wowed at our attacking play than many against Newcastle. The pace is missing, We got into so many positions or situations where United teams of old will release it to whoever 'that guy' is in our team and he'll run with it and have people excited. We are currently playing without that option, that joker if you like. Everything seems too methodical.

4705~~~
Is there no way we can buy him under 30 mln pounds? 40 is just too much IMO but for 25-30 its a no brainer.

4706~~~
Potato, potatoe...

4707~~~
If only . . .

4708~~~
I was more talking about Welbeck for us (I have seen some Arsenal games and I don't get them as in lot situation they would have 4 players in the box, but Welbeck outside and trying to keep the ball and find someone, even if he is supposed to be the main striker, but that's another story anyway), and how he did when he played a striker (did you see the stats from last season, when he played as a striker - he was actually our best striker, with the best chances conversion). Also, Falcao actually missed quite a few chances (QPR, WBA, Everton were all HUGE chances, so these were really big misses, which we don't expect from him).

OK, put Falcao on the wing and lets see his stats, thas what you are actually doing when you compare Welbeck's stats as Man Utd player. Falcao not only that he wouldn't score, he would not do anything good for the team as a winger. 

As far as I know Welbeck was our most dangerous goalscorer last season when he played as a striker? 

I just don't get how people don't understand what I am saying!? It was always said that Welbeck's overall play is good, but he doesn't score enough. This same is said for Falcao during his time at United and we can all see it. But when I compared them, suddenly there is a problem and also excuses about his fitness. Who cares? Welbeck played huge percentage of his games as a winger so that's his excuse. Shell I compare how much they cost and then see what we got till now from Falcao?

I really like what I see from Falcao and I also said that I expect great things from him, as you can see how dangerous he is, and also unselfish and we all know his past and that he is a born goalscorer, so that's all fine, but no one can say that I wasn't right with my comment before and actually prove it (I don't care about his fitness as I am not blaming him for anything, or saying that he is bad, or something like that, but it is a fact that his overall play is good, but he doesn't score enough - YET) .

4709~~~
The touch to set it up and snapshot technique to get over the ball and keep it down is insane.

4710~~~
He is missing chances and that makes him similar to Welbeck? So a goal or assist per 90 minutes of play is not enough? He is our most productive player at the moment - if he keeps the same way I will be more than happy.

4711~~~
He has missed sooo many sitters though. Ashley Young gave him two chances on a plate, and he pretty much missed a open shot against Hull, so he still seems kinda rusty in the final 3rd.

Beast of a player though!

4712~~~
No, I don't think he would be a very good winger. Don't think De Gea would be a very good #10 either.

4713~~~
No brainer at 30mil but 40mil is too much?

4714~~~
It's not our money...so who cares what the price is!

If United choose to spend next seasons CL money on him then I wouldn't complain.

4715~~~
He's hardly missed loads of sitters. He missed the chance against hull because it was blocked and had that everton game, the rest he was a fraction away from reaching the ball. Like against Newcastle from youngs crosses, he was so close to many of them but that sharpness will only come with games. It's not like he's missing them, just being a split second behind them.

4716~~~
That's a fair point - I don't disagree. We've lacked that for a while now - that proper X factor of a player. We haven't had that since Ronaldo left, really, apart from the odd moment from a Rooney or even a Nani - but they've been odd moments, nothing consistently dangerous in the way you suggest.

4717~~~
Whether we like it or not, the 3-5-2 actually enables us to set up like that in attack!

4718~~~
When did this happen? Specially with the 2 extra o's.

4719~~~
That was one shit half from him.

4720~~~
Poor half. Trying too hard I think.

Him and Van Persie need to split that defence, they keep running into the same areas

4721~~~
Watching this first half, I again find myself frustrated that it's not Rooney up front getting the chances that Falcao isn't taking thus far. I reckon we'd be 2-0 up by now.

4722~~~
Very poor, he should have scored 2, if he isnt capable of scoring those we might as well keep Welbz. Not strong enough, not putting enough fight, has to do better.

4723~~~
That shot when he cut in and Lloris saved, I was certain that was going in. Likes to put himself around a bit, doesn't he.

4724~~~
Can't fault his effort. I said in the match day thread he is reminding me of diego Forlan when he was with us. Always working hard and looking for the ball. Desperate to impress. But like Forlan his touch has been poor and his finishing pretty awful

4725~~~
Trying hard but looks off the pace. Doesn't help that he has to play two matches in less than 48 hours. Not ideal for him but hopefully he has a goal in him for the second half before getting taken off.

Maybe a change of boots might do him good because he is slipping all over the place.

4726~~~
Don't think he's been that bad. He's also been kicked about all over the pitch.

4727~~~
Having a shocker in all honesty, wouldn't be surprised to see him score having said that

4728~~~
i thought his movement and overall play has been very good. His shooting and finishing absolutely poor. Still dont know why so many jump on his back, he needs more time i guess

4729~~~
I think he's done alright...

4730~~~
The Latin Welbeck.

4731~~~
He'l score today.

4732~~~
He just needs games, what was 1 year that he was out?

4733~~~
He still doesn't look anywhere near fit or sharp. His touch is invariably horrible and even his goal attempts are soft now. He's miles from being the predator we thought we were getting. At this rate, it doesn't make any sense to make his move permanent. Let's see how the second half of the season unfolds but I can't say I'm confident we'll ever see the real Falcao again.

4734~~~
It's actually shockingly bad in this game, someone check how many times he lost possession,he ruined most of our attacks.

4735~~~
I think his legs look like lead. Maybe 2 in 3 days is too much for him, even if he only played an hour against Newcastle, he did play a full match 5 days earlier. 

Baby steps.

4736~~~
Yeah he's got jelly legs.

4737~~~
Exactly. No point in criticising him too much. Sure, he should've scored but he looks knackered.

4738~~~
Yep. Good thing is that he taken some heavy hits and his knee seems fine. Would definitely have Wislon warming up.

4739~~~
He's still adjusting to the English game too, it really hasn't helped that he's lost chunks of time with injuries. You can tell at times he is perhaps used to having a bit more time on the ball and combined with some match rustiness, tiredness its affected him a tad.

His all round game has been great though, little doubt if he stays injury free he will constantly improve.

4740~~~
Still looks a threat to be fair

4741~~~
Probably not used to playing 2 games in 48hrs. Should come off in teh second half.

4742~~~
Did you ever get that when you were about 11 and played a 4 and a half hour match down the park when all of a sudden your energy escaped you and all you could do was laugh?

4743~~~
I usually just collapsed to the ground instead.

4744~~~
How so? His movement is good but on the ball he did almost nothing right in that half.

4745~~~
The runs are there from him, only lacks the sharpness in front of the goal which will come with match fitness. Hopefully he scores today so his confidence won't be shattered.

4746~~~
No excuses any more, he has been shocking.

4747~~~
He hasn't been great today at all but Spurs are closing him down almost instantaneously.

4748~~~
feck off kane

4749~~~
this game has gone very scrappy, goofball creeping back in

This ref is the biggest cnut in the world.

4753~~~
Some of posts here should be in match day thread I think?

4754~~~
His touch was very poor today but workrate and movement were good, not sure how he didn't get subbed in the second half though.

4755~~~
19 games to win a contract

4756~~~
I have still yet to see anything to persuade me why he is worth the stupid wages/fee that we are/would have to pay for this guy. He looks decent, but thats about it. Finishing hasnt been that good, he never wins anything in the air and loses possession too easily. Yes, his movement and work rate are decent but he is hardly a Tevez or Rooney in that respect.

4757~~~
Chorley's had a mare.

4758~~~
Tell me more...

4759~~~
Falcao seemed to struggle with the pace of the game today. His touch and decision making weren't on it, that allowed Spurs to nick the ball off him time and time again. Very disappointed with his finishing too. Work rate and commitment are great but Welbeck had both of those in abundance, the reason we went for Falcao is goal and he didn't take his chances today.

4760~~~
Bad game from him today. Never looked like he had the legs.

4761~~~
Not the mort balanced runner is he. He's still at about 65 percent I'd say(in relation to his absolute best) .

4762~~~
I don't think he was that bad in the first half. He should've scored at least a goal, but apart from that I thought he did fine. Clearly tired in the second half though and was invisible.

4763~~~
Yeah, as I've stated before, the impact that Falcao needs to be having from now until the end of the season is a Costa/Sanchez type impact if we're gonna be paying anything around 35m for him.

I feel that we need to be more ruthless as a club and only settle for the absolute best up front.

4764~~~
Very bad today. Clearly he isn't ready to play 2 games in space of 2 days. No idea why EPL does that though.

4765~~~
I really like him...he's only had a few games 90 mins. However..I just don't think LVG is going to think he's worth 250k a week to be honest...plus the sign on fee.

4766~~~
Movement and all that was great in the first half, but really uncharacteristically poor finishing today. He doesn't put enough power in his shots.

Looked absolutely knackered after 50 minutes though. Sometimes I think we should have a winter break.

4767~~~
Thought he was shite today. He doesn't hide, to be fair and put in a shift but he was horribly laboured and clumsy with everything he did.

4768~~~
Starting to not want him on a permanent basis. His record before coming here can't be argued with, I always thought he was really quick but that doesn't seem to be the case. May just be one of those forwards who aren't suited to the pace an physicality of the premier league.

Still like him, he seems to give his all. Just a shame I don't see many signs of him taking the next 19 games by storm.

4769~~~
I thought he was fantastic today in the first half, he opened up loads of space for Mata and Rooney and he worked well I partnership with RVP. I agree that he shouldn’t have been playing two games in two days, that may have taken the shine of what I thought was a very impressive few days for him.

4770~~~
Don't know where the criticism of him in the first half comes from, it was a decent centre forward display just lacked a goal. Anonymous in the second but so were most of our attackers.

4771~~~
"Fantastic" might be a little too much considering the chances he missed.

4772~~~
Could it not just be a case that the injuries have taken there tole.

I remember for years people talked about Torres being out of form, realistically he just wasn't the player he was and never would be again. 

Not Saying Falcao has declined to Torres level but I think a combination of not being suited to the league and injuries are the issue.

4773~~~
true and sadly, he does remind me more and more of forlan for us now..<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4774~~~
Fantastic is too much, but shite is also too much. He was average. Less of the kneejerk reactions the better imo. Although, I don't think his move will be made permenant.

4775~~~
What I don't get is why he is playing on the left and rvp on the right. Surely it would be better to have them both shooting on their stronger foot

4776~~~
While he was unlucky not to score the last game, he brought the 'unluck' on him today himself. He's had two very, very good chances that you'd probably expect him to finish given his finishing ability.

Not really a 'just' though, he's had two very good chances to put it in and he didn't, thus the criticism. Same can be applied to RVP. Good runs, Mata picks them out but they've fluffed everything today.

4777~~~
Crazy to throw him on for the 90 minutes in a 2 day turnaround. Absolutely poor management really.

Or are we trying to "play" him into form like RVP? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4778~~~
Let's hope not, because Forlan went on to be a beast in Spain after we got rid.

4779~~~
He looked a downgrade on Welbeck today tbh. 

Shit control, shit balance, silly needless fouling and most worryingly of all shit finishing.

4780~~~
His legs have gone, or that's what it looks like to me.

4781~~~
A bit much playing him twice in 43 hours, considering he wasn't fit to play more than 20 or 30 minutes a couple of weeks ago, according to LvG. Was poor today, but Wilson hasn't shown much more. Having Di Maria or Herrera fit would've solved a lot of problems.

4782~~~
He's not fit enough, that was proved today.

4783~~~
Doing a lot of things right. Work rate, movement, etc is top notch. Touch needs to get better though.

Thought he was alright overall, a 6-6.5 performance.

4784~~~
Didn't look ready to play two games in quick succession. A decent first half followed by a laboured second half. I was disappointed with him and RVP. The second half in general was just poor, no penetration at all.

4785~~~
He was like a wobbly womble toy on the ball at times today, some great movement as always though and was constantly looking to get involved, no worse than RvP, neither did the job they are paid for today.

4786~~~
Never really felt confident he was going to do anything when he got the ball, the total opposite to the form he showed at other clubs. Hopefully he gets sharper as this wasn't fatigue like the rest of the lads.

4787~~~
Always gonna be tough ask to play 2 games in 3 days with his injuries this season and having only played 90 mins once before this season.

4788~~~
Maybe, but his overall play is being underestimated on here, IMO he was only behind Mata for MOTM

4789~~~
Looked tired and had two men on him at all times. I'd say rest him for the New Years game and play him against Yeovil.

4790~~~
I don't just mean in this game. He doesn't look like he can run.

4791~~~
Slow and weak just like his strike partner today.

4792~~~
Lost the ball every time it went near him in the 2nd half. Finishing is still poor.

4793~~~
Does anyone else find his reaction to being challenged a bit embarrassing? I know lots of players do it to win free kicks and get the opposition booked, but Falcao is a bit much for more liking in this respect.

4794~~~
He is missing to much, again today we could see it. Goal or assist per 90 minutes is good, but when you had enough clear chances to score 2 goals per game (again, QPR, Everton, Hull, today, enough chances to have a much better statistic) and you don't have it even close, then it's a problem.

How much more does he have to miss so that some people admit that he is near the player (goal danger) we are expecting him to be?

And all this discussion because of a comment which can even be proven with stats (take just the Welbeck's stats from last season where he played as a striker) and where I even said TILL NOW.

4795~~~
Nah, cmon. DDG had a good game, Rooney was fantastic in the first half and an engine throughout, Young was busy and effective in the first half.

Falcao was a long way off 'good enough', let alone a MOTM performance.

4796~~~
That's poor if any. We were somewhat lucky with RVP, but we might not be so lucky with Falcao.

The chance he missed with almost a gaping goal is something I just can't give him any excuse to be forgiven with.

4797~~~
He looked really tired, has played 3 games in a week for the first time since? 

Sadly, we had no options going forward on the bench. This guy will score a lot of goals for us.

4798~~~
Yeah we did - Wilson.

4799~~~
Looked fatigued, especially in that second half. His general play and movement was pretty good at times. All was let down by some poor finishing from him. We know he's better than that at taking chances. However Van Persie looked like that earlier in the season and was given the chance to play himself into form.

At least he's match fit though, i'd like to see us continue giving him opportunities to find his sharpness. Our whole attack just ran out of steam too early.

4800~~~
Don't care about past reputations.  He looks pretty bad.  Certainly not worth the asking price or weekly pay.  Him and RVP look so slow together it's just silly.

4801~~~
.
I think his work off the ball is being ingored here, in the first half he was opening the Spurs defence, I agree he wasnt as effective in the second half and as a result either was Mata, Rooney or Young

4802~~~

4803~~~
He's been less then inspiring recently tbh. Plus, LVG was forced into using a sub at HT and I was pleased Smalling and Shaw got some time.

4804~~~
Come on, man. He was crap tbf.

4805~~~
I think this was his first really bad game for us. Has been impressed with him before apart from that he has scored far too little for us (and he was signed for mainly that so..)

4806~~~
I'm surprised he started today after the Newcastle game for obvious reasons, but I don't think he was particularly bad all things considered - at least he's working hard when things aren't going for him in front of goal rather than sulking like some strikers do. His attitude seems very positive and gives me the belief that he will eventually hit form.

4807~~~
Hyish lyegshh ar gawn.

Are you not afraid that being that one grey and sketchy footnote, that billy nobody movie extra,  that one insignificant gray dot in a gray mass of mongatellos making sleazy 5th grade throw away comments, will be the breathtaking highlight of your life? 

Look at the RvP thread for exanple. Not even DDG was safe from stupid condemning conclusions on his overall quality as a keeper during the early stages of this season. 

Do you want to be that one in a thousand colorless mass of wool and mehhh or do you want to lead.

4808~~~
Shut up Kevin.

4809~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4810~~~
Player recovering match fitness after major surgery plays poorly in the second game in less than 48 hours.  No surprise; shows LvG thought Wilson would add nothing.

4811~~~
falcao was a beast in spain already.

4812~~~
I disagree, his finishing wasn’t the best but his off the ball play was very good. Both he and RVP opened up so much space in the first half, its blossoming into what could be a deadly partnership.

4813~~~
Indeed. He played well until the ball got to his feet.

4814~~~
I think both of our front men did exactly what you'd want them to do apart from putting it in the net. They were getting into good positions and opening up Tottenham's back four frequently in the first 60 minutes. It was just a lot of very poor finishes unfortunately. It's frustrating.

4815~~~
Preety much this.

4816~~~
I don't think his legs have gone. Typical rusty performance you expect of someone that has played very little football. There was bursts here and there, I think he just needs a consistent run of games tbh.

4817~~~
I think there might be a future for <i>me</i> as a United striker...

4818~~~
He works hard but still can't cope with the physicality of the premier league, he loses most challenges easily, not for the lack of trying though.

4819~~~
He can't control the ball properly. Hopefully it's just because of the lack of confidence/playing time.

4820~~~
It sometimes looks like he's forgotten how to actually run, he seems to spend half falling over or on the brink of falling over. He should, hopefully, improve as he plays more games but unless his touch improves massively and he starts scoring at a Costa-esque rate then we should go nowhere near paying £43 million and 300 grand a week for him.

4821~~~
Felt he worked hard throughout the game, and you can see he wants to make an impression. He was everywhere. Didn't watch him much in Spain, but is his ball control normally so careless? Maybe it's a lack of match fitness, but he's been back for quite a while now.

4822~~~
Yeah he's definitely not worth that money imo. I'd like to see another season on loan though if he does pick up in form.. I'd rather use him and discard him as harsh as it sounds.

4823~~~
Looks so clumsy sometimes.

No denying his quality when on form, but no way should we pay him £250k a week for performances like that, those are games we actually need players like him to turn up.

4824~~~
A dark haired Forlan some say

4825~~~
A lot of snap judgements.

He clearly is not for enough to play 180mins + in days yet, but he made some good runs and on another day would have had 1/2 goals.

4826~~~
I think you are on to something here. Probably more right than I am. Maybe this is just who he is days.

4827~~~
Not ideal for someone making a living playing football.

4828~~~
Looked knackered today.

4829~~~
I only saw second half but he was pretty anonymous I thought.  Wasn't the only one to have a disappointing game.  Played well against Newcastle but he has to bring more to the table than he's done so far.

4830~~~
Another 90 mins under his belt.

4831~~~
Not a promising partnership between RvP and Falcao.  I don't recall a single pass between the two today...only 3 against Newcastle and one of them could hardly be called a pass with intent.

4832~~~
There was intended irony in my comment.

4833~~~
In my opinion we played too many long balls to him and he didn't seem to win any of them! Its unfair to judge him too harshly with lack of service in the second half but should have done better with that chance when through on goal

4834~~~
If he is going to justify the huge price tag he can't afford too many more games like that, I still think he is going to need at least another 4 or 5 games to get back to full fitness, you can't fault his commitment or attitude though but he looked very rusty whenever he was on the ball and was shattered in the second half.

4835~~~
Yeah, he's only going to get fitter and more confident from this. Bit of patience wouldn't go amiss, because he will start scoring.

4836~~~
I like the guy, he works incredibly hard for the team, and is clearly desperate to succeed here, but frankly his finishing has been woeful for us. He scufs and snatches at chances just as much as Welbeck did. Looks nowhere near a £43 million striker right now. He's also desperately slow.

I do feel for him though as he seems like a genuinely nice guy.

4837~~~
We've not seen the best of him so far. Hopefully he can avoid any further injuries and get up to speed, because when he is up to speed, his record proves he's a slightly better finisher than Danny Welbeck (no disrespect to Welbeck intended).

4838~~~
I'd love to see Falcao up front on his own against Yeovil next Sunday. Once Di Maria returns then he should be in the team instead of Falcao but Falcao could still turn out to be lethal when he gets his match fitness up to speed

4839~~~
Well he certainly doesn't justify a massive fee yet. Maybe he'll get better.

4840~~~
To be fair to him, he'll have felt the brevity of the 42 hour gap between games more than most. Without a decent base of fitness, recovery will be a bit harder. He's looked so heavy-legged this season. Would be great to see him playing with a spring in his step.

4841~~~
Without a doubt. Today you saw just how rusty he was. When Mata played him in he tried to take a shot on his left when it was begging for him on his right, a match fit Falcao would be putting that away. Hes also a step off his team mates which doesnt help but i'm sure it'll all come together sooner rather than later.

Also its funny but today i thought he was very "Welbeck" like, lots of effort but very little reward. Quite a upgrade when you think this was probably his worst game for us!

4842~~~
He got into great positions in the first half but his footwork is so slow at the moment, it takes him an age to get the ball out of his feet. He's probablt trying too hard as well, he wasn't getting much service in the second half meaning he had to drop deep which made him look even more knackered.

4843~~~
We had to put up with over a month of RVP putting in really dismal performances (worse than Falcao today) before he came back into form and was capable of playing the full 90, and Falcao is coming back from injury as well, people just need to be patient with him instead of expecting the moon on a stick just because of his wages.

4844~~~
We've got QPR and Leicester coming up soon, both sides who will give us chances (hope I haven't jinxed it saying that). Bag a few in those, and he'll be flying going into the early Spring, ready for the run in.

4845~~~
If there was an option to send him back in Jan and we could get a really good striker (two very big ifs, I know) then it wouldn't really bother me, tbh. As far as I can see we're basically paying a shitload of money to rehab a player that can't be a million miles away from being past his best, just for the chance to massively overpay for him.

He's obviously a game lad who is very talented but he's clearly injury prone and he leaves our attack looking very one paced. Had we bought him after Porto or even Atletico then it would have been a good move. Thus far I haven't seen a single reason to buy him.

4846~~~
Can we trade Van Persie for Falcao? I'd do it in a heartbeat... Radamel has looked far better even in miserable physical condition. Van Persie has scored a few goals but he looks completely off form still, even this deep into the season.

4847~~~
I agree with this. RVP had AGAIN a great chance to pass to him and tu put him into a big chance and he didn't, AGAIN. What is wrong with him?

4848~~~
For me the issue is what we're (potentially) <i>missing out on</i> by making Falcao a huge signing - it means starting him, and while RvP is here that means starting two slow number 9s who are getting in each other's way and at times negating attacks.

It also means missing out on a better striker when we have no need to settle. We need to become more ruthless in the market and aim for the absolute best.

Some people on here are becoming sentimental toward Falcao already which is mental. Running around and 'wanting it' is for squad players like Welbeck, Smith etc - from £45m fee, elite wages players you <i>must</i> demand more! Touch, finishing, turning it on for big matches etc.

I'm not saying Falcao won't rise to it - but that is the least we should be accepting, that impact that Costa and Sanchez have each made is what Falcao needs to bring to us.

And regarding his fitness I do feel for him, but he's been here for half a season on a year long loan and if he can't get and stay fit then for me that would be another reason not to make the move permanent.

4849~~~
I see him and RvP running into the same spaces.  Both have instincts of a #9.  RvP is not one to pass so attacks will pretty much end when he gets the ball.  I don't think we'll ever see the best of Falcao in this system.

Thinking back on RvP's career, has there ever been a prolific scorer alongside him?  It's one of the negatives of having him, he doesn't work well in a partnership.

4850~~~
You are looking at it the wrong way. If in one game you have one player score 4 out of 10 goalscoring opportunities, and a second player score 2 out of 5 goalscoring opportunities, by your logic the first player is worse, because he has missed twice more. I would take the first player any day - he gets in more dangerous positions and also produces more goals.

4851~~~
I haven't seen much of Falcao before he made the move to us, but he seems very clumsy on the pitch.  To me he just appears to be stubmling and fumbling around, has a difficult time retaining possession and sorting his feet.

Know his reputation has him as one of the top strikers in the world pre-injury, but does he fit our possession style?  At this point from what I've seen, which has been little, I'd prefer someone up there like Hernandez who can be a threat behind defenders to create space in front of them for the likes of Rooney and Mata.

Still early days so hope he finds some form.  It's just his style and way he moves that has me questioning his abilities.

4852~~~
I actually thought Van Persie was better than Falcao today but his stats are a lot worse. Credit where it's due to Falcao. I guess he's being criticised (including by me) for looking so clumsy at times. His contribution, statistically, was decent enough.

4853~~~
You are saying that he is not missing CC chances? 

I was comparing him to ONE player, who did not have the numbers you are showing. Also, Falcao didn't score 4 goals from 10 chances, he scored 2 for now and should have had at least 5 if we only count really big chances and he did have more chances. After today's game my argument is even stronger. Falcao is supposed to be TOP striker and TOP goalscorer and he is not giving us that for now (even if I think that he would better work with Rooney as second striker, but it's a different matter).

We can find a million excuses, but it is a fact that he is playing as a striker, but is not scoring, while his overall play is usually good.

4854~~~
RVP improved a lot with his movement, but is decision making regarding Falcao has probably costs us some points.

4855~~~
11 games and 6,1 in rating from a pro falcao board?? He is not worth Mich more than Balotelli today.

4856~~~
Knee jerkers out in force in this thread jeezus Christ.

He had a pretty poor game (as did RVP yet again) and people saying his legs of gone, crazy. He was excellent only a few days ago vs Newcastle. He did look tired in the second half but I think all this game time will benefit him in the long run.

He is going to need a run of 7-8 starts before judgments can be made

4857~~~
He is gets still into decent amount of chances, just needs to start scoring again, which should come, I hope.

4858~~~
Exactly, that instinct to get in the right positions hasn't gone, it's just actually taking the chances that is letting him down at the moment, but yeah that should come hopefully. The Welbeck comparisons some have made are utter ridiculous, let it go he has left the club.

4859~~~
He's a busy bee.

4860~~~
I have made the comparison, pih, and explained it and I know I am not wrong (again, am just talking about these games, not what I actually expect in the future).

PS
I have a feeling that people think that I said that Falcao and Welbeck are the same, which I didn't, I just said that for now Falcao gave us the same Welbeck was, but not the goals we are waiting for (and actually it was also kind of compliment as I didn't expect him to have such a good all round game).

4861~~~
I think that was his first full 90 mins for us today and he did ok. He is going to improve.

4862~~~
If Van Gaal would just stop subbing him out every game and let him get a solid run of games, he'll get his confidence back. He's scored goals everywhere he's played but he's not as fit now as he was back then. Just give him more chances, stop playing Wilson over him and let the man play!

4863~~~
Not looking the top striker he can be at all this season.

4864~~~
Played the whole Villa game.

4865~~~
You're not wrong Brophs. It seems we signed up to a pretty crazy deal.

4866~~~
Honestly it's hard to put the blame on a poacher when we didn't create a lot. We hit a lot of balls over the top and that suits someone with a big frame like RVP better than falcao. I think we'd get the most out of him when we get young and (if we had a good right sided player) the right wing back on the ball and whip crosses in. That's what falcao is good at, getting between the keeper and the defence. Look at his goals for athetlico, so many were balls put across the box that he got to because, whether he's quick or not, he knows where to be and he's incredibly athletic and aggressive in getting to the ball. His headers are accurate. He plays like hernan crespo or van nistelrooy a bit. I think he'd improve a lot if we can get januzaj and di maria back in the team and get some quality balls into the box. He's not going to create something out of nothing like we often need.

I would agree with the notion above that himself and RVP are a bit similar in their movements but I hope they can form a better partnership in the coming weeks

4867~~~
This was my - perhaps unduly pessimistic and negative - take on the move when it was announced.

It's not about the man's quality as such either. If he gets back to somewhere near his best, he's a brilliant player. It still doesn't make it a sound deal, however. It still screams "unnecessary" for me.

4868~~~
A more optimistic spin would be that we saw a chance to sign one of the best strikers in the game, while still in his prime, and grabbed it with both hands. The downside being that it would take him a few months to get back to his best after a long time out injured.

We'll know in April/May exactly how realistic that sort of optimism was. For all his struggles for form, I'm not sure I'd be too happy if a club like Arsenal or Liverpool had signed him, put it that way.

4869~~~
Has the workrate of Tevez, needs to start taking those chances though, not really in the groove yet.

4870~~~
Very true. We would be all bricking it on here if either of them had signed him in the transfer window. It's only with hindsight that we know he isn't near his previous best

4871~~~
That's why I was glad it was only a loan when the move was announced. I never wanted Vidal for health reasons and I wasn't high on bringing Falcao in either. I know a lot of people really want to see the best in his performances, but we need clinical strikers if we want to return to Europe's top and Falcao just isn't that while RVP is also not the player he used to be a couple of seasons ago so far. 

I'm willing to give them both more time, especially since we need Rooney in midfield with all of our players injured, but once Herrera and di Maria return, I wouldn't be opposed to benching one of RVP or Falcao and start Rooney up front again. As a finisher, I like my chances with Wazza a lot more than I do with Falcao or RVP these days.

4872~~~
I do not think that Falcao was bad today, he was fighting upfront. He did miss a couple of chances which he would normally put away, and I can see him being more clinical after a couple of more games, especially once Di Maria and Herrera are back.

4873~~~
I thought he did ok however he missed quite a few chances as he did against Villa. 

He isn't quick either and the defenders are catching him quickly. Today he was very clumsy with the ball, that first chance of his should have been a goal. 

I thought RvP did better although neither scored. Mata also missed a sitter.

4874~~~
Like Andy Cole before him, it's taking a while, but boy when he gets there it's going to be fecking orgasmic

4875~~~
I am not convinced he is a Premier League striker. Yes, he did well in Spain. But England is different. It is taking too long and he misses too many easy goals. Remember Forlan? He did well in Spain, too.

4876~~~
RVP missed the easier chances today yet it's Falcao getting the stick. Weird.

4877~~~
RVP is a proven striker in England. Falcao is not.

4878~~~
I can only see him going back to Monaco . If the bale rumours are true we must be going with a front 3 of bale , rooney and adm next season .

4879~~~
Van Persie's all round play was very good whereas Falcao struggled to keep hold of the ball over and over again. It's not all about missed chances.

4880~~~
I think we watched different games.

4881~~~
Should have come off for Wilson today.

4882~~~
That's what I thought. Stats say different though. Falcao made more passes, more accurately. A load more defensive work too. I'd say he was dispossessed more than VP (haven't seen any stats) but that might be just because he got on the ball more. 

I think the criticism he's getting is because of a few very noticeable clumsy bits of play, which is over-shadowing his overall performance.

4883~~~
Tis the Caf

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4884~~~
Nicely put. He's done his bit to save us from the static crap if nothing else.

4885~~~
Second highest pass completion in the team. Only the uber basic style of Antonio Valencia today had a better percentage. What were you watching today?

4886~~~
I thought he got dispossessed quite a few times, rather than loose passes.

4887~~~
Only positive from today was he didn't stop running, apart from that he had a shocker with losing the ball.

4888~~~
I don't know. He just doesn't strike me as top class, hasn't done in a single one of his performances for us. Actually I thought Leicester was perhaps his best performance.

4889~~~
Looked tired from the start today. His least vibrant performance so far.

4890~~~
Throughout this season, players such as Rooney, De Gea, Mata and RVP were criticised endlessly. They showed their class in time. It's time we give Falcao a chance to get to full fitness and then judge him.

4891~~~
I think falcao while effective hasn't got an eye catching gracefull style which in games like today looks rather clumsy at times . 
I thought around the hour mark he looked knackered and with van persie also looking empty this allowed Spurs back into the game.

I really think the system we play doesn't suit him and he would fair a lot better in Chelsea's 4 2 3 1 system . I don't know if it's just me but Ive noticed that van persie  doesn't like passing to falcao and I sense a lot of frustration coming from falcao towards rvp . I really want him to do well,  although I feel that a major injection of pace will be the way forward next season with all the bale rumours I can't see both rvp and falcao being on the pay roll next season .  Falcao will need to bang at least 15 in from here on in to justify any 43 million fee and even that return may not justify an outlay of that size.

4892~~~
Yep I think that's key, there were also a couple of minutes at some point in the game (I can't remember precisely when though) where he lost every ball he touched in a row which made him look quite bad. But retrospectively it was a microcosm. And as Sheldon said above, he's not especially graceful as a player which doesn't help to appreciate all he does. Thought he was ok today, not especially great or bad, just a solid performance which would have been very good with a goal to top it off, of course. Like most of the team, he was very tired in the second half though.

4893~~~
Fair enough. He also made the joint second most ball recoveries - 7 (with Mata, Rooney had 8) if that helps justify it slightly. Good defensive work and hassling in spite of the possession losses - no stats available on my app to confirm the exact turnover quota.

4894~~~
He never stopped running today, weird that people are blaming his poor performance to just tiredness.

4895~~~
Yeah, he's just not as sharp as he was before his injuries at the moment.

That's completely natural but still the relevant question remains: Is he showing enough to justify paying the required amount of money for him? The answer is nowhere near. The second question is: Why should we play him into form for Monaco for a 10 million fee and 300k wages a week?

It's very hard to argue that this loan deal hasn't been a complete failure so far.

4896~~~
He still needs to recover a decent (consistant) first touch. Most of the balls played into him become 50/50s he has to fight for

4897~~~
He'll come good. He's back playing and increasing match fitness by the minute. I have no doubt he'll start smashing them in soon. Don't forget he's been playing in pussy leagues most if his career, it will take time for him to gain the strength and confidence for this league. Aguero and Suarez were both shite in their first seasons in the EPL. Every game is a step in the right direction. 
Love him

4898~~~
His touch is really shambles, he looks clumsy on the ball and is stumbling all the time. Dont understand why people keep saying that the lad is strong, you can barely see him winning duels, he gets muscled out easily and hardly wins aerial battles (unless it's in the box). He has good workrate and his class isnt suddenly gone, but he needs to kick it up a notch, with players like di Maria, Herrera, Blind coming back, I wouldnt be surprised if he's moved to the bench.

4899~~~
I dunno why we're discussing whether we should buy him or not, wasn't it said that he's basically a Man Utd all but in name? Because Monaco wanted to go around FFP restrictions so we would only give them the cash next season? I'm pretty sure he's a Man Utd player and he probably knows what as well.

However that means RVP will probably have to be moved on (Even though he won't because he's LVG's goldenboy) Surely we can't have 2 strikers who do the same thing on 200k per week? Even at Falcao's best 2011-13, I think Persie was easily the better striker but he is 3 years older than Falcao so maybe Falcao is a direct replacement for RVP?

I hope we bring in another pacey striker in the summer also, Someone like Benteke would be brilliant and it would stop Liverpool getting him.

4900~~~
Where they!? Or are we just making up utter nonsense now to excuse Falcao's lack of arrival thus far?

Aguero scored over 20 league goals in his debut PL season. Fired City to their first PL title and was voted City's POTY in his first season.

Suarez was signed in January and was one of Liverpool's best players for that half of the season.

4901~~~
No they weren't <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4902~~~
why is that even important?

4903~~~
He's the one in a hurry though.

He wasn't<i> that </i>bad today, but he should've done better with the chances he got.

4904~~~
Oh I thought City's title winning season was Agueros 2nd season, my bad. My point stands with Suarez, I remember some pundit questioning Suarez as he'd only scored 14 goals in his first 14 months at liverpool, performances aside. Maybe I am just sticking up for Falcao, desperate for him to succeed here.

4905~~~
2nd half his energy just seemed to go out like a light. More worrying was his clumsy control. I'm desperate for him to succeed but he looks a shadow of his former self.

4906~~~
If we get into the champions league, you have to think there's a better striker to lash such big cash on.

However, at least he's starting games again, so can only get better when it all comes together

4907~~~
It wasn't that long ago Van Persie couldn't play beyond 60 minutes before we had to hook him off, it took him a good couple of months to get his fitness to where it is now so 2 games in less than 48 hours for Falcao who is just coming back, it's got to be expected he would fade.

4908~~~
In a hurry for what?

4909~~~
He's played 540 minutes - exactly 6 full games and that has been very spread out and he's just back from injuries. He averages an assist/goal every 108 minutes. Rooney averages a point every 109 minutes in the league and RVP one every 150 minutes. 

Only Di Maria is superior to Falcao so far with a goal/assist every 96 minute. Herrera averages one every 118th minute or so.

4910~~~
Quite effective but very, very clumsy?

Also, I think playing two strikers with no pace really dents our ability to stretch teams and create space for our schemers.

4911~~~
Suarez was playing second fiddle to Andy Carroll in his first 14 months that's why. Under Rodgers he scored 30 goals in 12/13 and 31 goals in 13/14, he would have easily scored that many in 11/12 if Dalglish played him up top on his own rather than the wings.

4912~~~
To get fit and perform of course. If he doesn't he'll be shown the door in 6 months.

4913~~~
That is pretty impressive. Those who are criticising him should wait until he gets a run of consecutive games before making their assessment.

4914~~~
He looks like a player who's had a serious leg injury - a bit like Anderson did when he arrived.  There's a fluidity of movement which is lacking, and which he may never get back. Also, to me, he may have had a hard life or seen too much sun, but he looks older than 28.

As Brophs said, we're paying through the nose to rehab a player who may never get back to his best. The money quoted is what we should have paid for a fit Falcao, with no ACL injury, who really is 28 years old.

The saving grace is that if he doesn't improve greatly, we can send him back. (At least I hope we can.)

4915~~~
It is excellent indeed. Considering how poor we've played and that he's been not just injured this season, but was out completely almost the entire last season and missed out on the WC of his career. 

All great goalscorers misses chances, if the team is playing well there should be more than one-two chances in the game. How much do you care when Ronaldo misses a good chance? He does so in pretty much every game but if the team is playing at a high standard like you guys are he still ends up scoring. 

Even when he's having a really poor day Benzema, Bale or Rodriquez comes along with a goal.

4916~~~
Compared to the chances he has recently missed, it isn't very impressive at all.

4917~~~
6 months is a long time my friend! I expect Falcao to be up and firing in the next 3-4 games.

4918~~~
Yeah, I understand.

I want him to succeed too. I was really, really excited when we signed him.

I guess more than anything else, I'm just aware of not getting sentimental over a player who's been nomadic their whole career, and who *might* not be up to the level we should be aiming for.

I also don't wanna see us get fleeced, which is why I keep going on about the Costa/Sanchez comparisons.

4919~~~
I was soo excited when we signed him, like many people here, i watched him few and far between, and since that match against Chelsea, and his seasons at Atletico Madrid, he really was world class, i am hoping to see that Falcao for us, what was encouraging was, he was getting into great positions, but he didn't look fully fit, he is still missing that sharpness, the way he cut inside and hit straight at the keeper with that chance, when he gets into his groove he will put it away 9 times out of 10.

4920~~~
Unfortunately he is falling more and more into Diego Forlan's curse.

4921~~~
If you didn't know who he was you'd probably think he was a bit average. He's living off his reputation for now.

4922~~~
I really like the guy but he should be scoring from that through ball Mata gave him. The games are ticking by and he really needs to start being the difference between winning and drawing games if he's to be the player we look like shelling out all this money for. 

Unlike our other new signings, who have had an awful time of it with injuries, Falcao doesn't have the time to settle. He needs to be scoring goals every game, starting away at Stoke.

4923~~~
One thing I haven't seen anyone mention is how weak he has been aerially, he was a monster in the air for Atletico. I don't think he gave Fazio or Vertonghen any sort of challenge today. The former is actually massive, yes, but it was like every cross or goal kick was always his.

4924~~~
Was disappointed by him today. It felt like we had two RVP's, who offered the same thing... Unfortunately without pace.

4925~~~
Was thinking this as well, and not only today. Think fazio had 100% aerial duels but Falcao generally has seemed really weak in the air. On the ball he hasn't seemed too weak but in the air, where he'd before be dominant, he is very much lightweight these days. Hopefully its just temporary and not a lasting thing. Just seems to get shrugged away from headers easily.

4926~~~
This is key for me. Falcao isn't even our player yet, we sshouldn't be spending a year trying to nurse him back and paying for the privilege of being able to do so. Not unless we were 100% on signing him, in which case why bother with the loan in the first place?

4927~~~
I think he's ours if we want him. If we had to decide now, I wouldn't. It's hard to see what we've gained from this very expensive deal thus far.

4928~~~
He was very good against Newcastle but he looked like a headless chicken at times today, I stood up when he was 1 on 1 with Lloris because I'd be banking on a player of his calibre to absolutely bury those chances he had and win us 3 points. He might have lost some confidence today which can't be good.

4929~~~
He should be putting away most of the chances he had today, but at least he's getting into dangerous positions to score in the first place and surely nobody is realistically questioning his finishing based on his performances in this league alone? unless he's done some kind of a Torres, I wouldn't be worrying. His finishing touch will return and those chances will become two or three goals.

I still think he'll come good and will be vital to us securing a top four spot.

4930~~~
Yeah, a few chances had me wondering before this also, but then the great technique for his goal sort of made me put it to the side. It's something I'll have to keep an eye out for.

4931~~~
I would say he looked "heavy legged" at times today. But let's be honest where else would he have played 2 high demand football matches in 48 hours?. England is a different animal in terms of physicality which he will need to adapt too.

It's a shame we didn't have a fit midfield as ideally LVG could have rested 1 of Rooney/RVP/Falcao against Newcastle and then swapped them today. 

Anyway the main thing is he is getting on the end of these chances, people were worried about his "running style" and bollocks like that. He is getting on the end of the chances, just needs to get back to his goalscoring best.

4932~~~
This! We had to play RVP how many games before he came good? And it wasnt even a fitness issue with RVP.

4933~~~
Ball retention and pass completion are hugely different things, particularly when playing up front. Strikers lose the ball most when the ball is played into them - 50-50s, aerial challenges, holding off the defender with the back to goal - and this is something that van Persie is really exceptional at. Falcao at his best is very, very good at this too. Falcao right now isn't. He's not on the same wavelength with his team-mates, he's half a second behind the play and he's clumsily bringing the ball under control and recycling possession.

If we want to try and boil this down to stats then you can look at the number of times he was dispossessed and the number of "unsuccessful touches" he has. I'm not sure how either of these are calculated but they paint a pretty clear picture. He was dispossessed 9 times and he had 3 unsuccessful touches. Without context those numbers mean very little to me, but when you put it in context of the rest of the players on either team it tells an awful lot. The entire Tottenham team were dispossessed 11 times, and everyone in the United team bar Falcao were dispossessed 10 times in total. He had the joint-highest number of unsuccessful touches too.

In other words he lost the ball far more than anyone else on the pitch through things besides passing, and that doesn't take into account the number of times he was half a second behind the play and didn't even reach the ball in the first place (which ironically were from many of van Persie's "misplaced" passes). You can illustrate a lot of things with these stats but without the context they tell you very little in truth.

What I saw was a Falcao that was still very rusty, very laboured and very workmanlike, and that's what he's been like in practically every appearance. I think the only game that bucked that trend was against Villa and a quick glance at the stats tells you he was "dispossessed" a grand total of 0 times. Newcastle too actually and he was dispossessed just twice then. That to me is a much more telling stat then pass completion for a forward and it shows that today he was particularly bad in that sense but even then it doesn't come close to telling the full story.

I still maintain that the Falcao we're seeing now is a really sorry shadow of the player we saw at Atléti and the people praising him for these kind of performances are doing him a huge disservice because he is so, so much better than this in every facet of play. Right now he's clearly not fully fit, he's clearly lacking confidence and as a result of that he's trying to hard, he's too much in his head and he's over-complicating very simple things. In short he's going through the same thing van Persie went through for the first two months of the season and he's had niggly injuries on top of that which have prevented him from getting enough game time to play through it and get back into shape. If we're going to persist on playing Rooney in midfield then I'm very confident Falcao will get his mojo back and get into double figures but he's still a long way away from that right now.

I still think that buying Falcao was one of the stupidest signings we've made in years - and as many people have said there have been plenty of them - because if you're paying a player that much and you have a player of that quality then you absolutely have to play him, and yet he plays in a position where we already have two players that are in the exact same position. I think it was simply a case of Woodward saying to van Gaal: "you want genuine quality, this is who we can give you, all you have to do is find a way to fit him in" and van Gaal went with it, but if van Gaal really pushed for him then I think it's a colossally stupid decision. Rooney is fine in midfield and it's great to have an extra body capable of supporting the attack but he's clearly not at his best there, so we're hindering our best player to fit in a player we didn't need in the first place. I don't get it at all.

Jorge Mendes has already said the reason for the loan was purely financial and that Falcao has essentially joined us on a permanent basis but the full transfer was delayed by a year for whatever reason. Something to do with spreading the revenue out for FFP or something like that.

4934~~~
Very good post, agree with pretty much everything

4935~~~
Great whole post, but this little snippet is something that is really, <i>really</i> bothering me at the moment.

These are Rooney's peak years, he's in brilliant scoring form, and we're shunting him into midfield so we can play two number 9s at the same time - neither of whom are as dangerous as Rooney is right now. It's literally mental.

4936~~~
I  can only agree with the last few posts and specially <a class="username" data-user="34496, @Brwned" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34496/">@Brwned</a> 's.

4937~~~
I'll give Falcao the benefit of the doubt for Sunday's performance and assume he was struggling to recover physically from Friday.

On playing Rooney in midfield, one assumes that the manager is doing it as a temporary expedient because his only good fit midfielder is Carrick. I'd expect Rooney to replace Mata or Falcao once more midfielders are recovered.

4938~~~
A lot of drama in here, as is always the case on the Cafe.

Two years ago Falcao was a top 3 or 4 player in the world. He's been pretty much injured since he got here. It's hard to come back from the serious injury he had, and hit the ground running. But to get where he has gotten in the game requires incredible dedication, determination, hard work, and talent. He has scaled heights that no-one else in this squad has ever matched (some may argue this point), so I think he deserves some time to rediscover his fitness and form. Van Gaal isn't sentimental. He has a track record of dropping big names. I find the argument that we are nursing him back to health for someone else to benefit to be absurd. In his brief recovery time he has been decent in almost every game. Even today, when he didn't play so well, he worked hard.

I really don't care how much he costs either, or what we are paying him. United isn't a club where money is an issue. He was good against Villa, only his second start of the season. Less so against Spurs just 43 hours later. But on the basis of this limited sampling there are people providing "expert" analysis. Surely the same experts that have written off countless youth products, even to the point of scapegoating and berating them but who, no doubt, in a month's time will completely change their tune if he starts rediscovering his best form.

He has 2-3 years left at his prime, which is being conservative given that his game never relied on pace. Van Gaal likes experienced strikers who are clinical in front of goal. You don't ever lose that, not really, and Falcao will prove that soon enough, once the rust is cleared away. If Van Persie goes down with injury, he suddenly becomes one of our most important players, because we don't have another no.9 of that quality.

Far, far too many conclusions and theories being bandied about on the basis of limited evidence, and limited knowledge. Falcao is one of the smartest and most driven professionals in the game, by all accounts, and I am excited to see what he can achieve over the rest of the season. I'm certainly not expecting miracles because I recognize that he is actually a human being, rather than a line of code in Football Manager. But if we do succeed in helping him return to top form, we will have one of the best strikers in world football on our books.

Personally, I love to see players of his caliber in a United shirt. It's symptomatic of the club's ambition to be back at the head of the table. It's a shame that people's memories are so short, and their patience so absurdly limited. Success is demanded instantly, understanding is in short supply, players are 'over-the-hill' at 30, pace is over emphasized, and sweeping condemnations or hyperbole are the order of the day.

I trust the club to make the right decision here, both financially and strategically. With regards to Falcao, the United player, I'm not making any judgement call based on just three starts, two months apart. I wish I could say that I am surprised that others would, but sadly I'm not. Modern football fans are like spoiled children.

4939~~~
I like him, but spending 45 on him instead of using that money as part of the Bale offer or giving it to Reus to get him to choose us would be madness.

4940~~~
In terms of spending big money, the central defence, right back, the wide positions and central
midfield should all have greater priority than a position where we already have two very good players (one of whom is playing some of the best football of his career). We'd really need to see something exceptional in the next few months to justify the outlay as  we can't base that kind of investment on what he did at Atletico two years ago. On the evidence to date, it is just as likely that he is following the Torres route (albeit with a better attitude and more raging against the dying of the light).

4941~~~
I don't think its a case of spending money on him <b>instead </b>of anyone. 

I think we are going to buy him regardless and will buy anyone else we need despite that outlay. 

I also think the club have huge faith in Wilson and having RVP phasing out over the next two years and Falcao hopefully phasing out in 4 years despite people calling it an "old" attack I think the balance is good. It means in 2 seasons time we will be able to buy another top striker and have Wilson (21/22), Falcao (30/31) and new striker who is hopefully at a prime age.

4942~~~
Bale isn't coming here, and we already spent a summer not spending a penny in the hopes of landing one of Bale/Ronaldo/Fabregas and look how that turned out.

4943~~~
Yesterday was 'one of those days' with regards to finishing. Rooney, Mata and RVP all missed chances they would bury any other day. It's no surprise that Chelsea and City also drew and I feel the fixture congestion is part of the problem. For Falcao to go from 20mins a week in competitive fixtures to 90mins multiple times isn't great for him or us and our expectations are naturally quite high for a player of his calibre.

I'm optimistic about the coming home fixtures and him finding some confidence and bullying teams like we have seen for years.

4944~~~
I dont remember Falcao being 1 on 1 yesterday? Have I blanked something?

4945~~~
Its like some of you never watched football before today. He wasn't good, but most are making large overarching judgments about his ability based on 1 (one) poor game. Get a fecking grip.

4946~~~
The chance where Mata put him through in the first half and defender got back enough to get a deflection on the shot and it went straight at Lloris.

To be fair he shouldn't have been playing that game yesterday. Guy has hardly played this season and asking him to play two games in 48 hours is too much. Sadly we had no alternatives.

4947~~~
Oh yeah. 1 on 1 makes it sound easier than it was but yeah, still expect better from him there. 

But I agree with you, should never have started yesterday. 2 weeks ago he wasn't fit to start, now he can start 2 times in 3 days?

4948~~~
Yep. He was excellent less than 48 hours earlier against Newcastle. I actually popped into this thread at half time yesterday because I thought he'd done alright in that first half and we'd played well in general and people were shitting on him. RVP misses the easier chances as it goes largely unmentioned. People have weird agendas for certain players.

4949~~~
Useless yesterday. His all round game has never been impressive throughout the years but yesterday he look as limited as Hernandez. He brought great energy to the game but it started and pretty much ended there.

4950~~~
Why would someone have an agenda against Falcao? He says all the right things, he works his bollocks off and he's obviously got bags of talent. There's no possible reason for someone to have an agenda against him. Perhaps people just see things differently.

4951~~~
I'm not overly interested what he can do outside the box. Welbeck outside the box was better then Falcao. We saw glimpses and i'm disappointed that he didn't take one of his chances but let's be fair. He's out of sync. He's had no pre season at least he's now out there during the cold months to be counted. Even if we don't want to pay the fee I hope we re-negotiate and I think Falcao would be happy with that. Let's make sure we keep up the positive vibes for him and he'll come good.

Some probably have an agenda because that's their way of already accepting (maybe) it's not going to work out and we're not going to pay the fee. Doesn't really matter if you like someone. I bet they're secretly hoping he can turn it around.

4952~~~
Who knows? They miss Wellbeck? Want Wilson to start? Have some 45 million transfer muppet player in mind instead of Falcao? All I know is he played well in the last couple of games before yesterday yet people were shitting on him as soon as half time yet the RVP thread gets no attention despite him missing the better chances and being as anonymous in the second half. His wages or injuries or something cause people to overreact massively to Falcao.

4953~~~
Terrible performance from him, I thought he looked overwhelmed by the tempo of the game and how little time he had on the ball, that’s why he was dispossessed so many times. Overall his play was very poor but I’m not very concerned about that, I think he can and will be much better for us.

Still, his movement is great. I really want him to make it here. I thought Van Persie had better chances to be honest (not that it changes anything).

4954~~~
He was knackered yesterday, hence the poor finishing. If you've played football before (and I'm guessing most here have) - then you surely know what it feels like when trying to shoot after your legs have gone from tiredness!

4955~~~
I don't think most had too much of an issue with Falcao's finishing, it's natural that players will miss chances and Van Persie and Mata, both of whom played better, missed clearer opportunities. The issue for me (and some others) is that even in the games where he's played better, his touch has been really awkward and he seems to be struggling to run in that he looks like he's falling over half of the time.

4956~~~
The over reactions here are nothing new, flavour of the month or what ever you call it.
On another day he would have buried his chances and would have been regarded as the best striker in the world again. On to stoke city...

4957~~~
The problem is not with the amount of money we might spend on him - the club can afford it, and it's not our money - it's whether he has shown enough to warrant his signing.

Many people are saying 'I'd sign him if he was £25m, but not £43m,' but what difference does it make? It's not likely that we will go without signing other players just so we can sign him.

I don't think he has shown enough so far, and I doubt he will show enough to justify signing him in the time he has left. There are probably better options for us out there.

4958~~~
Tbf to him Fazio is 6" 5 while he's only a 5" 10. In terms of height Fazio absolutely towers over him. He's a beast when he's attacking the ball from crosses and ball hit into the box because he's an excellent header of ball. Winning nod downs and flick ons are different matters. Its fine if he can't win those aerial battles because we are structured around dominating the second ball. Its his sloppy touch and possession play which were hugely disappointing yesterday.

4959~~~
kinda looks like Forlan the way he runs

4960~~~
People are ignoring this conveniently - he was great vs Newcastle...he isn't used to the league (only 6 starts) AND no one outside of England plays so many games in a week during the cold Christmas period. He was obviously physically jaded.

4961~~~
He's clearly good, like outrageously good but there's several things going against him. The obvious one being the injury and the time he's spent out of the game, the next him being unhappy at Monaco, next he moved to England on a loan (practically a trial) and lastly the English media are ruthless. 

I really want him to be a success here but I can't see it happening. His runs have been world class so I wonder if we had a Pirlo in midfield would he have more goals? The same could be said for any striker with great movement though. 

As the season passes by fast, he's under even more pressure to produce goals in a shorter space of time,  not that I doubt he won't score more goals but you could get most players in the world for £45 million and the said £250k a week.

4962~~~
Not that interesting, but I read a stat saying he made the most fouls out of any PL player that played yesterday.

4963~~~
I like him and want him to succeed but I think posters on here overrate his goal scoring ability, he will need to continue assisting as he has done to justify that price tag. Posters on here talk about him regaining Athletico Madrid form so if he did that he would score about 70 goals in 91 games which is a fantastic record but how many of those were penalties?

I'm not sure where to find these stats but I read an article that stated he scored in 2012 - 13 for Madrid in the league 28 goals in 34 games however 8 of those were penalties so if he weren't taking penalties here then that would equate to 20 goals in 34 games putting him at the level of Negredo and Soldado in terms of non-penalty goals scored.

It could be a load of bull I don't know, it's here though:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2014/09/02/here-is-why-manchester-united-is-taking-a-risk-with-falcao/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/...nchester-united-is-taking-a-risk-with-falcao/</a>

So this is Non-Penalty Goals per 90 minutes and Penalty Goals per 90:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2014/09/falcao_penalties.png" src="http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2014/09/falcao_penalties.png"/> 

This is a combined chart for the two seasons he was at Athletico Madrid showing how he ranked in terms of contribution from goals and assists:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2014/09/falcao1113.png&amp;w=1484" src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2014/09/falcao1113.png&amp;w=1484"/> 

Essentially he is a fantastic player who will surely contribute plenty but probably not worth the investment since we already have enough number 9s and 10s, we could just play 1 up top if needed and we would probably be better off signing a Robben type player, somebody who will be a winger in a 4-3-3 but could still play as a 9 in the diamond but will drift to the flank and run at players, I quite like the two up top but with a Robben type winger who can play through the middle as a RF but drifts to the right flank and then Angel di Maria as a LCM but drifts to the left flank.

4964~~~
Fantastic post !
Agree with everything !

4965~~~
The chances he has squandered since joining, Rooney would score them all day. Why are we playing our best striker in midfield when we have plenty of midfielders? What's that all about? Falcao can't do anything that Rooney can't except those headers and his movement. It's just pointless and we're reducing the balance by playing him and rvp up top.

4966~~~
If he is indeed already bought then I really hope he comes and shows us his true ability because things will only get difficult for him.

4967~~~
Not really. They're all injured at the moment. Rooney is essentially filling in AdM's position as the box-to-box/carrying midfielder.

Once he's back I expect Rooney to go back up front and then rotation between Falcao and RvP. Both are out of real form (for different reasons), hopefully one of them can start picking up goals soon. I think they were as bad as each other against Spurs (with regard to mucking up chances) for what it's worth.

4968~~~
Yes but RVP seems to be getting himself in good positions and is making good runs consistently, I think if we left him on against Villa he would have scored because he was getting himself into the positions you want.

Although I agree Falcao needs to earn his place I do think Louis van Gaal will drop Juan Mata when ADM is fit and play Rooney as the 10.

4969~~~
He averages 1.8 shot per game for United, which is half of what he averaged for Atletico.

Someone like Aguero who is being praised as the most clinical striker about these days averages 5 shots per game - and one goal per game. So roughly 20% conversion rate which is what Messi also has. Costa averages 25%.

Ronaldo conversion rate is 28%. Lewandowski converts 14% of his shots, Bale roughly the same.

RVP scores 16% of his shots, Rooney 20% and Falcao converts 13% of the chances. Some interesting comparisons - all statistics are from the league only and like always statistics don't paint the full picture.

RVP has scored 5 out of his 8 goals and 2 of his 2 assists the last month. Previous to that he scored 3 goals in 11 games and provided no assists. The team scored 20 goals in that period though.

It took RVP 3 months of consistent game time to finally start delivering so hopefully we will give Falcao 3 months of starting every week before we expect miracles.

RVP had no real reason to not be firing on all cylinders except the WC, Falcao was injured last January - half a year of no football at all which was followed by injury issues this season.

He has not played consistent football for 11 months, yet in his third consecutive start people complain about him not being in form.

4970~~~
Be a shame if Mata gets dropped. He's been playing really well whereas before his injury Di Maria's form was a bit patchy. I'd let Falcao play his way into top form.

4971~~~
Leave this thread, sense is not allowed in here.

4972~~~
Great post - it beggars belief the ridiculous expectations of some. Most players don't even adapt to a league properly when fully fit for at least a year, much less one who hasn't played for half a year and was recovering from serious injury. The only issue is the price tag and given the kind of value Utd has as a club that isn't rally an issue if we want to keep him.

4973~~~
In truth his form has been quite good, including in the Spurs game (first half anyway)

4974~~~
He is very rusty and a bit too anxious which he showed against Spurs. I feel he will need at least 8 full games with us before he will gather form, fitness and consistency although I would not start him against Stoke. They are very physical and he took a bit of a pasting v Spurs who are not really known for a being a physical team. 
If we can get him back to 90% of what he was pre injury we will still have one of the best forwards on the planet. Its all about the money of course but you can see Falcao is determined to prove himself as he already seems to love the club and really wants to stay and despite being pretty poor last game he still showed he is 100% committed by never shirking any challenges or stopped showing for the ball.

4975~~~
Me too and it might happen but Louis van Gaal won't be planning short term therefore he might want to try and get Rooney used to that 10 position, if he is playing the diamond or 3-5-2 as the long term vision then I think the 10 needs more defensive qualities since there are two strikers ahead and so he operates as the fourth midfield and thus must support the other three, Mata is much better as a 10 behind one striker I think because he can have less defensive duties.

I also like the idea of Herrera as a 10, Carrick, di Maria, Strootman like player and then Herrera ahead of them.

We will see what happens, Mata has been excellent at home but his goals and assists away from home have been very poor I think, not sure the reason for this.

4976~~~
How dare you be so sensible.....!!!!

4977~~~
He is only getting back to full fitness so I don't really understand all the critisism. Falcao at his best is the best striker in the world. I am all for playing him as much as possible to try and get that quality of player back. He won't get there by sitting on the bench.

4978~~~
So this is how girls feels when they post a picture of their yoga-pants from their "gym session" on facebook. New years resolution - get yoga pants.

4979~~~
I think people are/were expecting too much too quickly from Falcao, patience has been lost in the modern game with fans wanting instant results in both success and performances on and off the pitch. Any player that doesn’t produce it is either to old, not good enough, past it or they will find some other stick to beat them with until they have been proven right. That’s not a criticism of anyone on here, it’s just a sad part of the modern game that has crept in over the past decade or so, social media, bad journalism and poor punditry and has only added to the frustration.

I have no doubt that Falcao will show his true self very soon, I’d even argue that we have looked a lot better in attack when he has played, further he will be more comfortable when players like Di Maria, Herrera and Blind get back into the side, he also has to get a working partnership with the team, that will take time and patience.

4980~~~
Too many people without medical degrees diagnosing Falcao's recovery from major surgery by watching games on TV. 

He had a poor game 48 hours after having a good game.  Unless he drank a get-terrible potion I'll chalk this one to fatigue.  How about we give him a month or two in the first XI before writing him off as a bust?

4981~~~
It is crazy to think that Colombia were rushing him for the world cup.

4982~~~
How close did he get?

4983~~~
He was nowhere near ready to play at the World Cup. He took most of the summer to do his rehab and took part to some preseason matches with Monaco.

4984~~~
Crazy <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

4985~~~
To be honest, i don't think that the colombian team tried to rush him, he wanted to be at the world cup, and tried to be ready for it, now he also planned the thing intelligently, he began training as soon as he could but didn't put to much charge on his knee, he wanted a long recovery instead of a short and intense one.
And he didn't tried to accelerate when the world cup was close, he just forfeited.

4986~~~
That's all good and dandy, however this is professional football. 

If he is not ready, if he needs games, then he should play with the reserves. 

If we had Herrera back, it would make more sense to play Rooney and Van Persie up front.

4987~~~
He also seems like an intelligent guy but I have no basis for this other than the way he comes across in interviews. That combined with discipline is important, it means he will do everything to maximise performance, things like managing his diet and rehab in accordance to the advice he has received from the specialists.

4988~~~
This is all it boils down to really. He was brilliant against Newcastle, it was always going to be a big ask to expect him to perform at the same level 2 days later after just coming back.

4989~~~
All for this give him time business, but it must be tempered against realising we are 5months into the season now, so it's not early days anymore.

But for me, if the club have shown they're now willing to smash massive fees on world stars, then you have to question why it has to be on Falcao, presuming he doesn't have a goal storming second half to the season

4990~~~
Rumors are that he's 2 yrs older than his stated age.  Could be bullshit, could be true.

4991~~~
Them rumours are nothing new, they've been around a few years.

4992~~~
Hes only just getting match fit. Give him time

4993~~~
He was good against Villa and excellent agaisnt Newcastle, people need to stop overreacting. He faded in the second half against Spurs but its not surprising in his circumstance, not to mention half the team were anonymous in the second half.

4994~~~
Exactly . Some expect too much too soon.

4995~~~
Cue the silly comments about how he costs 50m and get's paid 270k a week so should be scoring hat tricks, taking on 6 defenders and nutmegging players every game instantly.

4996~~~
This thread is hilarious.

4997~~~
I think we've signed him already and it's just about making the numbers work. I'm amazed about some of the comments on here. He could have arrived 100% fit and still struggled. We all know that it takes time for some players to adjust to this country and this league. Not to mention the team with a new manager and players. Let's give him and the new players some benefit of time. If we are patient, we might have one of the best 3 strikers in the world at the club.....he's that good.

4998~~~
Honestly, I don't think he'd be a worthy investment as well given his ridiculous price tag. But if the reports are true and that we have already signed him, I think he'd still be fantastic addition. He's an honest and hardworking professional, and his personality fits the club. You don't have to look at the stats to know that Falcao is a vastly superior player to Soldado and Negredo, both who were found out in the PL. This is a man with a proven European pedigree, he tore up the Europa league for two consecutive seasons, put 4 goals past Chelsea and have professionals from all over the world raving about his ability.

Right now he going through a major bump in his career, and I believe that if we keep the faith in him, we would be rewarded tremendously

4999~~~
Nobody is saying this

Just read <a class="username" data-user="34496, @Brwned" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34496/">@Brwned</a>  post again and it sums the issue up very well

The transfer was very strange to begin with, I think some are just blinded by the glitz of a big name and are desperate for him to succeed no matter what the cost

If utd are not in a committed contract to complete the deal any sane person would be itching to pull the plug right now

5000~~~
Yes it was an exaggerated comment but a lot of people are using his price tag as a stick to beat him with and not willing to give the guy a chance. Let him play get a run of games together and fully fit before we even start judging him. It's way to early too say we should pull the plug on the deal.

5001~~~
We are half way through the season. He will need to be pretty special in the remaining 19 games. I hope he is, don't get me wrong. I'm loving his attitude and the fact he looks really happy at the club. These are big things for me, but he surely needs to tear the league apart for the club to part with this amount of cash?

I would be quite shocked if we are tied into any permanent deal

5002~~~
As of now I'd rather sign a striker that injects some pace into our squad and gives us a different option, even though I really like Falcao and want him badly to succeed.

5003~~~
There is a chance that he will fail I'm not denying that but writing him off before he's even fit and hasn't played enough is ludicrous. Great as player he is Falcao is not a miracle worker, if you give him the service he will score goals, but you can't just expect him to 'tear up the league' when playing in unsettled team/formation, but that's down to LVG to sort out. Let's just hope he and our other key players can stay injury free so we can play the system LVG wants to play.

5004~~~
I think he will suit in a more open game aswell. Right now the 3-5-2 is a very slow tempo possession based game, where as a 4231 or 442 gets the ball up the field quicker. I think his movement can be wasted a little as he makes many runs but rarely are they used. I think with a good few days rest he will look sharp against Stoke.

5005~~~
Doesn't look like he'll ever recover his Atletico form. Unless he stays fit which he hasn't this season, I'd be surprised if he hits 10 goals.

5006~~~
We will probably keep using 352, so as such Falcao must either adapt to the high possession/passing style of play or he will should look at a different club.
After scoring 2 goals for us, he is already a huge fan favourite - I dont understand why...it defies logic.
You only have to look at the match day threads to see how many fans wanted to see an unfit/injured Falcao start games for us...over a fully fit, proven striker (RvP).
LvG will be looking for results and Falcao will need to deliver within the next few months, otherwise he will be returned to the seller.

5007~~~
Based on what? Dont be such a drama queen ffs. Considering all circumstances, he's done well and it's obvious he's a top player. Give him a creative, good midfield and he'll start scoring for fun (the same goes for RvP as well)

5008~~~
Dude on here all you need is a gut feeling. Have a look at the Welbeck thread... That guy hardly did much here to show he would be a great striker but everyone there thinks he is

5009~~~
It's just that things need time in football. We all as fans are impatient and every other week write off a new player and it annoys me when everyone jumps into conclusions without considering all circumstances

5010~~~
I think he'll improve and I think he'll start scoring fairly regularly but I'm getting less and less convinced we'll sign him permanently. A pacey wide forward would give us much more balance and might not cost upwards of 40m at 29. Wouldn't surprise me if we just loaned him for another season.

5011~~~
I don't think that's too much of a surprise. We're talking about a Van Persie who had been poor for the best part of a year that was getting into the side ahead of one of the world's best strikers who we'd just signed. The situation has changed now but Falcao's status amongst fans is fair enough given what he's done in the past.

5012~~~
That's not entirely fair since the last time Falcao was actually one of the best strikers in the world (2012-13), so was RVP.

I'm fairly pleased with both of them at the moment. Ok, they cost us the game by missing chances against Spurs, but in general RVP has emerged from his slump and looks in good form and Falcao seems to be improving fast as his match fitness comes on. He makes us much better by being on the pitch even when he doesn't score, bringing movement, energy and aggression up front which RVP on his own doesn't provide.

5013~~~
You're right in that things have definitely changed. Van Persie has improved massively and Falcao brings energy that we lack with Rooney playing deeper. I was happy with Falcao against Newcastle but disappointed with him against Spurs, though he gets the benefit of the doubt having probably never played games so close together before.

5014~~~
Despite it being a loan, what would be the case if we signed him permanently from the start of the season and he was struggling adapting to the pace of the prem, settling in England and coming to terms with new team and players......those fans who have adapted that mentality, would have sold DDG after his first season. Dont care what formation we play in the future, a club of our statue should have a world class squad and even more so if we are in Europe next season.

The idea of pace is an issue but it's not like we aren't creating chances.

5015~~~
For me we're in a good situation up front, in that you'd like to be able to fit Falcao, RVP, Rooney, Mata and di Maria all into one lineup. Clearly that would be unwise, so even with one of those players injured (which is almost certainly going to be the case at any given point in the season) we'll be able to field a 'best XI' attack. Lots of different combinations: you can choose between Rooney and Mata in the hole, or put Rooney in midfield and choose between Mata and di Maria in the hole, or put Rooney up front and choose between Falcao and RVP to be his partner... the list goes on.

And the signs are there that the group are developing a really good understanding on the pitch. The goals against Liverpool and Newcastle showed that.

5016~~~
How can it be too early when we're half way through the season? Its a time sensitive loan and he's half way through with mountains to climb that are too much for him.

Besides, we agreed to a fee that was too high even if he was at his best and never had any fitness concerns and for a player with a short time left at the top of the game. The only situation where he was going to be a success on that deal is if he hit the floor running at the beginning of the season and did ridiculous things for us all season long. We bought Van Persie for half his price at just 1 year older and he was coming to us as the best player in the league, and clearly made the difference to help very largely in winning us the league the next season. At just a year younger and twice the price the least you'd expect is that same level but due to fitness and form Falcao is nowhere close.

5017~~~
It's too early because we haven't seen what he can do on the pitch yet, he may be past it but how can we tell when he hasn't even completed 5 full games yet? All i want is the guy to have a fair go, if he stays fit and is rubbish until the end of the season i will then say he's not good enough and shouldn't be retained. The fact that he hasn't had the minutes to show what he can do it is early in that sense.

We shouldn't be concerned about the fee, we pretty much over paid for every player since we signed Fellaini, that's one of the problems of being out of the CL and competing for top players. If our new signings including Di Maria, Shaw, Rojo, Herrera were on loan would you be saying the same thing about them?

5018~~~
That's why I think it's a done deal already. If you apply a logic to it, we knew he wasn't fit when we signed him, we know that with that type of injury it can take time to recover and find your form. The club knows despite the price tags, it still takes time to adapt to a new country, team and league. Why would they sign him for a season loan knowing it was unlikely they may not see the best of him in his first season?

5019~~~
The trouble is his age. It could take another 6-12 months to get him 100% fit and firing, but by then he's going to be on the wrong side of 30. 

If he was 25 or 26 then he'd be worth the risk but not at 28/29.

5020~~~
I know plenty of others have made the point before me, however, its worth repeating.  Walcott and Falcao got the same injury at the same time....where is Walcott in terms of his fitness?  Exactly. 

Falcao was rushed back too soon and is still trying to get fit.  Im desperate for him to do well and i have concerns but we cant make a judgement yet.

5021~~~
He's 28, how will 6-12 months down the line make him the wrong side of 30?

This thread has become ridiculous.

5022~~~
Agree. Utd also aren't going to outlay 250k a week when they know a percentage of the year is going to be his rehabilitation, and that's why I believe it's already a done deal.....

5023~~~
We wont know if he's "past it" after 5 games. We're unlikely to know after the season, because even if he gets momentum and is scoring every game the most he can show is that he can do it for half a season which wouldn't show he's back to his best because he did more than that at his best.

But he'll be 29 by the seasons end so odds are against him being at the top of his game for too long, if at all. So no big loss if he goes somewhere else and scores lots of goals, we'll have someone else that we bought instead doing the same for us, or Rooney will be up front doing the same while we bring in a new midfielder.

He's never going to be worth the £44 million though. For that kind of money you want a longterm player, not someone past his physical best in 2 years. All of the players you mentioned are younger players who can prove their worth over a 5 year period. Falcao needs to be doing the business now because he's already at his physical peak. For that money you probably also want someone who can play multiple positions and is hard to stop being effective. Players like Ronaldo and Messi who can play in multiple positions and cant simply be marked out of the match by top performances from CBs. Box strikers like Falcao are far easier to stop, cut out of the supply and he's not going to make something happen out of nothing from deep. It's too much money for those limitations, again especially for someone with age and injury problems.

5024~~~
Because its a punt as cover, with Welbeck and Hernandez already wanting to leave? If he just happens to be scoring every game we might want to buy him and if not, we can find a much better solution in the meantime.

I do think we basically already signed him though due to his agent's comments. I just hope it isnt true... Because that would be a right mess.

5025~~~
Come on...do you think LVG is the type of manager to take 'a punt'? Why would a team pay a player coming back from a serious injury, who's not proved his fitness, not proven in this league, not guaranteed first team football, let a young English forward go to a rival, and pay 12m pounds for a 1 year contract on 'a punt'?

5026~~~
So you'd be happy to pay £43 million on a player that will be TURNING 30 by the time he's fully fit then? Personally I'd say that was ridiculous.

5027~~~
I have seen both Ronaldo and Messi marked out of games looking like they aren't even on the pitch. And how can you be certain he won't be performing once he reaches 30?

People moan about the fee but Falcao is a very popular and marketable player, looking at the amount of money the club makes the finance guys there know what they are doing and are not stupid, they wouldn't invest so much money in something if they didn't think there would be a return on it whether on the pitch or off it. So money shouldn't be the concern here for a player like Falcao.

You say we should spend 40m on another striker but who is available? the best strikers in the world at the moment are Ronaldo, Messi, Ibra, Suarez, Lewandoski, Aguero, Costa none of them are available and some of them would cost a lot more than 40m.

5028~~~
i'd spend 40 mill on charlie austin, he's a regular goal scorer for me in fifa 15

5029~~~
I'm not the one making judgments 4/5 months into his time at the club.

I'll wait until the time actually comes to make a decision, which is another 4/5 months down the line.

5030~~~
I suspect he's our player already as some have stated, judging by Mendes's comments. 

I wouldn't spend anywhere near that amount of money on what is essentially still a big risk, though. As I've read elsewhere RvP cost us half the Falcao-amount and came with a performance guarantee that paid instant dividends.

5031~~~
There's no current top 10 striker where the 40m represents nothing but his wages over a 3 year contract. Let's apply a level of sense and logic that until he has had a run of games where he is fit, and can't adapt to the prem then make our assessment. This is also based on the caveat that the teams playing half decent football too, with a number of key players returning from injury.

5032~~~
But people often forget RVP was in the last year of his contract when we bought him, 24m for 1 year left is still a lot of money, Falcao was in the first year of his long term contract at Monaco so was inevitably going to cost more. Also when RVP came he was the top goal scorer in the previous season and played in the PL for a number of years so was already accustomed to the league. It's completely 2 different situations which are not comparable.

5033~~~
Agree with you, this is what i've been trying to say.

5034~~~
All those factors point towards RVP being a risk worth taking - while factors like uncertainty about the extent of Falcao's recovery, his performances for us thus far, his sluggishness and his price tag along with the wage packet makes Falcao much more of an unknown quantity.

My point is excactly that those are two completely different situations - hence why I thought the RVP signing was a no brainer and the Falcao signing is a big gamble which I doubt will pay off. But hey, it's not my call luckily. If it were I'd be inclined to bring in a younger striker with pace.

5035~~~
We have James Wilson.

Yes it's a risk i'm not denying that but i think people are jumping the gun and writing him off before he's had a chance to show what he can do.

5036~~~
We have James Wilson, who at the moment is nowhere near the quality bringing in a striker of Falcao's pedigree (while at his best) would add to us - and probably never will be of that quality. 

If we're going to sign a big name striker, I'd sign a pacey striker that gives us variety, so we don't have to blood a totally unproven striker just to add much needed pace to the side. Let Wilson develop in his own tempo.

5037~~~
I don't think pace is an issue with Falcao at all. I was watching highlights of himself in his prime at Athletico and he is/was pretty fast, not Aguero fast but still pretty quick. Not sure if his injury has fecked his speed up but he runs proper weird now, almost slow motion like.

5038~~~
You're contradicting yourself there - yes he wasn't slow, but he's not got the pace he once had. 

It's one of the reasons I'm against his signing even though I like him as a player. The knee injury seemed to have fecked up his running, at the very least he's not moving as freely as he did before. Also he's slower on the turn, not the explosive predator in the box he was at his best.

5039~~~
Like I said, can we at least wait this he's played 90 mins on more than a couple of occasions before we make assessments about what he was and now isn't?

5040~~~
Some people were saying he has never had pace in the first place, I seen one video where Falcao runs box to box and skins about 6 Barca players to score.

5041~~~
I said 31 which tends to be the decline. He'll be 29 by the summer when we buy him. 2 years from then he'll be 31

No he's not going to make the money back off the pitch especially in such a short space of time. And just because we have the Falcao money doesn't mean we need to spend it, or more importantly spend all of it. If we can get someone who fits in better with what we have (we lack pace up front) or can do just as well as Falcao with goals, it doesn't matter if they cost £40 million or £20 million.

But there are obviously going to be players out there who will perform closer to their pricetags than Falcao at £44 million so we should be studying them all right now.

I watch this video (which i'm sure will have been posted many times already), and it's hard to imagine that the talent to do these things would just disappear. Which makes me optimistic.

Then I think, Shevchenko.

5043~~~
Let's just let the lad retain his fitness before we get too pessimistic

5044~~~
I agree.

5045~~~
Happens the other way too though, people will rave endlessly about players who've had a couple good games. You'll always get people on the extremes. In reality it's as you say. Things need time. And even then, you never know how things will pan out.

5046~~~
I'd take 80% of that......

5047~~~
I would wait till his loan spell to get completed before deciding.

5048~~~
So who is this other young fast striker people would rather sign? 

Let's have some names.

5049~~~
When is the latest Louis would have to decide this?  If it's as late as May then let's come to a judgment in May as to whether Falcao is worth buying outright.

5050~~~
He's not going to magically be able to run fast. Or turn fast. That's limited by physical capabilities. He might look a yard or two sharper when he returns to full match fitness, heaven knows he'll need it. 

I'll happily be proved wrong by a fit and firing Falcao but I don't think he's the player he was. 

People have said for the better part of a year that we should give Fletcher time as well, but he's just not going to hack it at this level anymore and everyone could've told you that a long time ago. I'm not writing Falcao off and he's obviously good enough for the Premier League, but if we're looking at that kind of investment my money would be placed elsewhere is all I'm saying.

5051~~~
Talking of money is a tricky situation, we don't know what the profit or loss on him will be, his transfer fee is huge but so are his wages, probably his bonuses and also maybe even his agent's fees.

But that is part of the equation, the expense, what about the income he generates? It's tricky and no doubt requires high level finance guys to figure out, he might be very valuable if he helps us immensely increase revenue from some markets, i'm not sure how much we make from the south american market relative to the asian but it is possible the likes of Falcao and Angel di Maria will somehow help with this.

Ultimately it's an investment but not just for on the pitch but for financial performance too, of course a player should only be signed for footballing reasons but once signed we should exploit him for financial gain, also if he increases our brand's reputation in certain markets that might pay dividends for many years to come, not just how long he is at the club.

Ed Woodward I think is a finance guy, he probably knows what he is doing, and I'm sure the business has an excellent finance team there who are capable of estimating the profit or loss of Falcao compared with other players and will advise Louis van Gaal on ultimately how big of a financial risk it is, I'm sure Louis van Gaal would be interested in how this signing could impact future transfer budgets.

If the rumours are true about Ed Woodward wanting to splash more cash, I wouldn't be surprised, certain expensive players somehow probably can financially benefit the club as opposed to hinder it. The Glazers were accused of not spending and now they are praised for it but it's possible the spending will be strategic and incentive given to the manager (more future transfer funds) to spend on those players that are likely to be a profitable investment.

I'm happy with our board because I think they are excellent, one of the best in football and I think they have been quite creative in their attempts to increase revenue, I'm sure they will have studied the pros and cons of a variety of transfer strategies from the frugality of Dortmund to the extravagance of Madrid, they will have their own vision of what is the most effective way to approach this.

5052~~~
The loan was a fantastic idea. Class player who brought a lift to Old Trafford and the fans. Hes shown how much he can contribute with his goals and assists in the games hes been involved in and thats no where near 100%. Theres still half a season left for him to justify us signing him and if not, then we dont sign him. Works out great for us

5053~~~
So if your not fit you can still run and turn fast then? I'm not qualified to make that assessment and I suspect neither are you. Fletcher illness is completely different as was his ability to start with. I'm not sure what he is or isn't but I'm suggesting the investment has already been made. Look elsewhere if you like but 40 m buys you nothing in this market for pedigree. If you can give me even one name of a player who is available for that money, I'm all ears.....

5054~~~
Hold the phone, £40m doesn't buy you anyone good!?

Aside from Aguero, that'd buy you anyone else in the league.

5055~~~
Personally i would play with one lone striker and sign a midfielder and a Winger instead of Falcao. Therefore i would have Rooney, with RVP and Wilson as backup.

5056~~~
Lacazette hands down, so far this season in 19 games he has 17 goals and 6 assists in ligue 1 and he is playing really well.

He is only 23 and he is at the point in his career where he needs to Move to a bigger club he would probably cost half of what it would cost us to get Falcao.

Why spend £35mill+ on an ageing, heavily injury prone striker that may never capture his previous form. Add to that Falcaos wages will be huge too, We already have a striker that's similar to this in RVP we don't need another one. I'll be so annoyed if we do sign Falcao. It would be such a waste of money especially when there is younger talent like lacazette around.

5057~~~
With regards to the £40m comment, I have listed the top goalscorers of the PL this year.
Aguero
Costa
Austin
Sanchez
Cisse

All except for Aguero could be had for less than £40M.
I can do this for other leagues, but you get the drift - £40M buys you a lot these days.

5058~~~
Lacazette is certainly a young and exciting prospect.
Who would I rather have - Falcao or Lacazette. 
Not sure.

5059~~~
For £40 million you could buy Marco Reus.

5060~~~
He's already horribly injury prone.

If he signed for us he'd probably die in pre season.

5061~~~
Good point.

Anyway, in the summer £40 million would've got us Diego Costa at half the wages Falcao bags. For instance. 

Point being: £40 million isn't something you gamble away, it's what you pay for an established top player in his position.

5062~~~
Marca ITK José Féliz Díaz thinks we've decided to sign him permanently and Van Gaal has approved the deal.

5063~~~
Can just see it, scores a hat-trick against Stoke and the mood of this thread will change completely<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

5064~~~
Good, he's a fecking awesome player. He might be expensive but he guarantees class, if you've got the money, where's the sense in going for a bargain.

5065~~~
If he scores a hattrick tomorrow I'll be fecking dancing on the tables, nevermind this thread. I badly want the guy to succeed as he was fearsome at his best.

5066~~~
I really want him to do well. his style of play is exciting and he has this aura about him. He will come good but it will take some time. He will prove vital when we step back to europe. I hope he gets to play against yeovil and bang in a few goals and get some real confidence. having him in top form could see us going on another win streak. he and di maria back to full form could be like a new signing for us.

5067~~~
Me too, and we've got half a season to see if he can get back to his best. If he does he will be a colossal signing if the purchase option is taken up

5068~~~
I feel like his heart is 100% in this, almost to the point he is too desperate to prove his worth, but I love the feel of a committed player of his caliber at the club. I was excited when we made the out of the blue deal, but I agree that the club should wait until the end of the season before committing to buying him.

My biggest concern is we will keep him and RvP and not add a younger, more explosive forward to the mix to give us more variety in attack. Before anyone says Wilson I mean someone a few years older who is proven to a good degree.

5069~~~
We have Van Persie and Hernandez on the books. Rooney can play up front, too (as well as Wilson). Sign a wide attacker. Di Maria can come central a bit more and Herrera and Mata are best central, too.  

Lacazette has played out wide in the past, so he might be worth a shout.

Falcao is a very good player, but it's a ton of money in fee and wages, he'll be 29 in a month and we have a glut of central attacking types. Better to take a huge swing at a wider attacker like Reus, Bale or Robben or even risk it and go for Depay or another top young talent the scouts/LVG like.

5070~~~
Who in the league?

5071~~~
Every transfer is a gamble, retrospectively it's easy to say what we could have done. For example, 80m for Ronaldo now looks cheap.

5072~~~
Lol. What a joke like Utd would be in for Cisse or Austin. Sanchez isn't even a forward. 40m buys you nothing when your talking top draw centre forward.

5073~~~
I'd disagree, though it also depends on what you describe as a top draw centre forward.

As it stands, I think it's a bit unclear where Falcao is.

5074~~~
David Bellion

5075~~~
We can buy back Welbeck for 50M. He is like Rooney, RVP and Falcao combined, only with more pace.

5076~~~

5077~~~
So £31M? That's good if accurate, he's more then worth it.

5078~~~
Hope this is true. feck the haters!

5079~~~
It's a very rushed deal in that case. Until now he's not been anywhere near worth the money we've handed him. A fair - and i mean REALLY FAIR - price for him today should be £25m!

It might be the fitness that's causing some problems for him, so if we sign him for all that money I will reserve my judgement until the season is over. I think we're heading the right way with signing only big players though. We shouldn't be behind the other top clubs when they move in that direction.

5080~~~
It's obvious the club don't have any question marks over his ability. We just wanted to make sure he wasn't a crock and the signs are starting to look good on that front.

5081~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5082~~~
Yep, further we have no idea what the fee is going to be, nor do we know what his wages will be. We have to trust the Club and the manager on this one, and so far all of LVGs signings have been a hit, or the potential to be at least.

5083~~~
He'll score a great header today.

5084~~~
Doubt it's been said, but can he do it on a cold day in Stoke?

5085~~~
I know form counts for a lot but if there is one foreign player who you would back doing it on a cold day at Stoke, it's probably Falcao.

5086~~~
I always thought it was likely that we'd agreed a fee with Monaco, and paid half up front so we could loan him for a year and assess his fitness. If we decided we wanted to keep him, we'd just have to pay the other half. Would be a pretty fair fee if we're confident he'll return to something like his best imo.

5087~~~
Delighted. Hope the fee is 40 million pounds instead of the reported 30, just to piss the disapproving people off.

5088~~~
Falcao is almost 3 years younger than RVP.

Also Lacazette is doing well, but too early to say that he is gonna make it in a big club. Remember, Gomiz looked as good a few years ago.

I don't even remember young strikers being as bad as now. The only world class striker under the age of 25 is Neymar. Usually, there were 4-5 World Class strikers under that age a few years ago. I expect that on a few years, we will have more options to choose from.

Also, if LVG trusts that Wilson will become a top striker, then it makes sense to continue with Rooney, RVP and Falcao until he is ready for EPL. I think that all will depends if Falcao can manage to stay fit, because the talent is still there. And if he can manage to stay fit - while he may never become again the third best player in the world - he'll be a top striker that will score a ton of goals. Let see in the end of the season how things are.

And finally, 31m pounds (if true) won't look as much if he can give us quality service for the next 3-4 years. RVP was his age when he came here and cost almost that (taking inflation in account it will be the same) and has been worth every pound.

5089~~~
Quite surprised by that Marca tweet. Personally I don't think anything has been decided yet as to whether we're signing him on a permanent basis.

5090~~~
Just for the hotness alone I approve this deal.

5091~~~
I'm conflicted on that one, i want him to sign permanently but i don't like the two strikers system.

5092~~~
What's the tweet?

5093~~~
See previous page.

5094~~~
His sexiness is worth 30m alone.

Sign him

5095~~~
United will sign Falcao permanently.

5096~~~
Glad to see the move made permanent

5097~~~
Why now.
The smart money would be waiting until the summer to see if he can score more goals than he has fingers on one hand!

5098~~~
His wage, he was willing to lower significantly his wage in order to join, us. If we sign him permanently now, we won't have any competition and can lower his wage.

5099~~~
Don't get me wrong, I'd love him to play as per his past form, and I was as excited as any fanboy at his arrival, but he's barely started games, let alone scored.

However, let him commence today!

5100~~~
I understand, but like i said we are paying the wage that he signed with Monaco, if we sign him we will be able to lower this contract, so if the club is convinced that Falcao is the real deal then we shouldn't wait, no need to throw money out of the window.

PS: Someone knows, if the 40m are before or after the 6m deduction.

5101~~~
Out of respect for a player of his stature.

5102~~~
I think making the deal permanent now might well be a good idea. It might end up being a weight being lifted off his shoulders. If you make it permanent now, he can focus on scoring goals without having to deal with other pressures.

5103~~~
I am not worried about the age of our strikers, top teams tend to buy proven goalscorers. When RVP and Falcao become too old we will just go and buy replacements.

5104~~~
I hope it's true and we sign him permanently. The days he hits his Atletico form again will be priceless and I honestly believe they are not too far away!

5105~~~
If we've decided to buy him now then the reality is we had already done the deal and it was being delayed for whatever reason. I struggle to imagine anyone committing themselves to a player of his age, after the injuries and performances he's had, at the price we've apparently agreed. All of the 'He has to prove himself' stuff will just have been proven pointless as we we probably always obliged to have bought him anyway.

5106~~~

5107~~~
Dreadful so far. Hopefully I've jinxed him to play better

5108~~~
lolololololol Radamel Falcao.

5109~~~
For much of this game he's looked uncomfortable, but he's got a goal.

5110~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Well done

5111~~~
He scores goals. It's crazy that people are doubting him.

5112~~~
Seems he can.

5113~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5114~~~
Get in there you little beauty, smell the onion bagand all it's rustic loveliness.

5115~~~
Glad for him, but his touch is really shocking. He looks like Hernandez.

5116~~~
As crazy as people thinking that's what some supporters are doubting about him.

5117~~~
I still think he ought to be playing right up top.

5118~~~
Started poor, his touch especially, but got better as the half went on and good strikers goal.

5119~~~
His touch has always been shocking, but his all-round game is decent. He doesn't get disposessed easily, doesn't get found on offside and has great crossing.

5120~~~
Couldn't agree more, he's much better being on the defenders shoulder. That is where he looks top notch IMO not build up play where he plays You g wide and to far away to get in the box.

5121~~~
Exactly. Said it in the RVP thread, but why isn't RVP coming deep? RVP is the better all round footballer.

5122~~~
I agree. This formation isn't ideal for him.

Clever finish, and one or two other very good pieces of play, with a couple of dreadful touches thrown in as well. He'll be crucial in the second half.

5123~~~
Been shit, scores. It's what top class players do. At least he has been involved whereas RvP hasn't even touched the ball.

5124~~~
So did Hernandez. He'll need to do a lot better than this.

5125~~~
Falcao Van Nistelrooy!

Just has goals in him. His play has been decent so far and I love the effort he puts in. For someone with such a remarkable goal record he is very unselfish and always looking to play in teammates.

5126~~~
Looks a shadow of the Atlético Falcao. Probably not ideal to say that in a match when he's scored, but anyway.

5127~~~
Started off poorly but since that nice piece of play when he nearly set up rvp, he hasn't looked back. Much sharper and a nice strikers goal. Was worried after ten minutes where the ball just seemed to be bouncing off him again but now he looks confident, and hungry

5128~~~
Delighted he scored, he was working hard chasing down balls and stuff up until that and it paid off with the goal.

5129~~~
His overrall performance hasn't been great today, but tbh neither has quite of few of them. I'm not worried, hes looked VERY dangerous in the last 3 games hes played

5130~~~
Good man Falcao,another important goal.

5131~~~
A better Hernandez. Still not shown in his appearances since the injury that he's worth £40m but hope I'm wrong.

5132~~~
Murmurs in the media that we are doing the deal for 40 million euros, which is about £31 million, a much fairer deal I'd say.

5133~~~
Well, he's only getting fit now. This is close to his peak fitness. Once the goals come in, then comes the confidence, then comes the first touch, then the masterclass. He's had a horrible injury and now he's coming back. "Shadow" was appropriate for Torres at Chelsea. This is merely fitness.

5134~~~
His touch has not always been shocking, that's bollocks. 

On the one hand I love him because he's got the enthusiasm of Hernandez and is always on the move to sniff out a goal, but the role he's being asked to play asks a lot more of him outside of goals than he's used to and I'm not convinced he'll ever excel this way.

5135~~~
He isn't a forward he is an out and out striker.

People have been saying since the day dot that he isn't great with his back to goal and his build up play sucks.
what is is an incredible goal scorer.

But we've got him playing in behind.

5136~~~
the time to judge him is when we're playing well and creating plenty of chances.

Today he's had the 1 good chance he's scored from, and a couple of at best half chances, mostly foiled by the wind.

5137~~~
I think people writing him off is a bit premature, sure hes looked really rusty but hes coming back from a really bad injury lay off. We all spoke about giving RvP time because he had a world cup but imagine coming back after 6 months out and having a few other injuries. Give him time and he'll do fine. Hes getting fitter and sharper with every game.

And another vital goal today

5138~~~
Jesus, his touch is horrific.

5139~~~
If I am not mistaken, during the final year at Atletico he was the second most disposessed player in Europe's five top leagues. A lot of times because of poor first touch.

5140~~~
This. Glad he scored, though.

5141~~~
One chance one goal. Still one of the most dangerous players in the box for us.

5142~~~
It's worth pointing out that he's had crisis of confidence before, even when he was at Atletico and Porto, where he looked like he was carrying the world on his shoulders and it took a few games for him to shift it and get his sharpness back so don't lose faith in the old him coming back just yet.

5143~~~
He seemed to get confidence in his touch after the goal and doesn't shy away from getting involved, he's certainly more active in attack than Mata and RvP today.

5144~~~
What was the point of buying an outstanding number 9 and asking him to play deep? I'm struggling to see the logic.

5145~~~
A little to unselfish like the pass to RVP when he didn't had any defenders infront of him. Old Falcao would go and scored a goal 9 times from 10 from this chance. But hopefully he will get there.

5146~~~
I'm sceptical about that, it looks more than just a lack of fitness to me. We'll see though, a few months down the line there'll be more evidence to judge him.

5147~~~
He's looking much sharper today. Pace seems almost back to normal and his movement is spot on, just has been unlucky a few passes hasn't reached him properly.

5148~~~
bad first touch, good runs, a lot involved and not too bad acceleration. His goal was excellent, classic Falcao finish. Hope he finds his touch

5149~~~
I agree to waiting for the end of the season. Far, far too early to judge him now.

5150~~~
He's close to 30, so I doubt we'll see the old Falcao.

5151~~~
There was opta stat I posted in his old thread that he was on top(in top5 leagues I think) in losing the ball due to his poor first touch two years ago.

5152~~~
He'll improve for sure. But there's surely no way we'll be spunking +40m on him. That would be complete madness.

5153~~~
I was just thinking of this comparison. Hernandez was criticised for not doing enough besides scoring, but Falcao is being lauded for the same.

In all honesty I am yet to be convinced that we wouldn't have been better off keeping Hernandez this season rather than Falcao. Financially we would certainly have been better off, and Hernandez's pace would offer us something different.

5154~~~
He is playing too similar to Hernandez at the moment without his work ethic. We might as well have kept Hernandez if Falcao is not going to offer that much of a difference. 

Although, I understand their is a huge difference of quality between the two based of Falcao's history at his former club. However, at the moment, Falcao has yet to show the quality striker that we know he is.

5155~~~
Without the work ethic? He's working twice as hard for the team as Hernandez did.

5156~~~
Nah, you must have forgotten, Hernandez work ethic was greater. He would run like a headless chicken almost every game for United when he came on and would put ton of pressure on the opposition defenders.

5157~~~
Seems like a nice guy with a good attitude. Didn't sulk about coming off.

5158~~~
Disappointed he came off. 

3 games in such a short space of time would likely be a challenge so I can understand it. He wasn't struggling yet but maybe he would have.

5159~~~
Nothing to do with fitness or his performance I think. Simply a shift in balance of players. Good move

5160~~~
The team was clearly set up tactically poorly and we really played in to the hands of Stoke with a back and forth physical long ball game. 

I think he did really well with that as the point of view, I wasn't expecting his hold up to be enough against a team like Stoke in that sort of game. 

But his hold up was surprising, he had a gritty and hard working game and like a poacher he got on the score sheet. Overall the entire team has been bad so far, but not the players fault.

5161~~~
MOTM, LvG ridicolous subs will cost us the game.

Januzaj as a left back reminds me when he used to play with Rivaldo as a full back.

5162~~~
He looks depressed <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5163~~~
Should have taken him off against Spurs, not today. 

Looked up for the fight, got a goal and looked good as the game went on. Very strange to take him off, instead of RVP.

5164~~~
I remember Lewandowski was also high on a list like that, and his first touch is very good. It all depends on how he's recieving the ball. Falcao's touch isn't bad and he showed that in the second half.

5165~~~
Surprised he got taken off he was a nuisance and a threat even if his touch was uncertain at times. RVP looked more likely to come off. Hope we are proven wrong.

5166~~~
Tbf in Atletico's system which is centred around a strong defence and midfield, the strikers are a bit isolated and lots of times receive long/difficult balls and/or are surrounded by a lot of opposing players. Complete opposite of Barca or Bayern and to a lesser extent some other teams where you have short passing patterns and more options to pass the ball to teammates instead of losing it.

5167~~~
He once again did not do well, at least not well enough to buy him.

5168~~~
He got us a point, that's good enough. In fact, he's won us 5 points with his goals this season, which is pretty good in my eyes.

5169~~~
Thought he was growing into the game and linked up well in some dangerous moments... then he got taken off, which was baffling because RvP was just invisible

5170~~~
Plays well. Gets substituted. Philosophy.

5171~~~
Van Gaal is nuts.

5172~~~
He did ok. Before his goal was very poor. But he dId better after

Looking at the MOTM stats and he is walking away with it? Smalling, Carrick and Jones all had better games.

5173~~~
Eh? He was our best forward today. Shouldn't have been substituted.

5174~~~
I was finally starting to think 'hey, this guy might just work out', then he gets subbed off. Annoying.

5175~~~
Carrick barely controlled the game and Smalling could have given away a penalty. Falcao, poor touch occasionally aside, was our biggest threat.

5176~~~
His first touch is so bad. I was actually glad he was off.

5177~~~
Strange substitution. Was doing really well when he came off

5178~~~
He's always been that sort of player though. Might not see him for ages, then he'll pop up with a goal. Good finish, and i felt he did grow into the game. That said, some of his touches in the first half were frustrating.

5179~~~
Not having this game managing him stuff. RvP was doing nothing bar that flash of skill. We weren't winning and needed a goal. Ridiculous taking him off.

5180~~~
To be fair to Falcao he does ask for the ball in highly uncomfortable situations, he is a risk taker in that sense - so it helps to explain his high dispossessed stats. Although one has to admit that his first touch isn't particularly great at the moment.

5181~~~
Unless he was tired I don't know why he was taken off. Sure, his touch was loose for most of the first half but he gradually improved as time went on. The goal came from his predatory instinct and you could see him getting in positions that might lead to more. We barely posed an attacking threat and his movement might have made the difference for us. Still a lot more to come from him but he's getting sharper.

5182~~~
Was our best attacker today, still far from his Atletico days. Hopefully, many more goals to come from him in the second half of the season.

5183~~~
Would love to see him in a formation with 4 defenders. Either leading the line by himself or along side Rooney or RVP with Mata/Rooney in behind.

5184~~~
Great strength, but the lack of pace was exposed in some situations. I'd definitely play him ahead of RVP. But VG seems to favour his countryman.

5185~~~
Our attacking threat went when he came off and Rooney moved position.

5186~~~
Still rusty but a good predator's goal. In retrospect probably shouldn't have taken him off but he needs some looking after in such a busy period.

5187~~~
I thought he was lively but in terms of real goal threat, apart from the goal itself, he, like most of our team, was lacking. Better than the other day, though, which is encouraging.

5188~~~
A little surprised how complimentary everyone in here is being considering the amount of times he lost possession with terrible touches early in the game. He obviously got better as the game went on and started to look like a real threat, but reading through these comments it's like he had a faultless game.

As for the substitution, it must have been fitness related. There's no other reason for it.

5189~~~
One of the few players who actually looked like they wanted to win. The rest just drifted through, either expecting something to just fall into their lap, or content to take the draw.

5190~~~
Are there any figures (for the last few games) on his distance covered/game and top speed reached in the game as well
He seems fit, but not sharp yet, first half the ball was bouncing off him lots, same against Spurs

5191~~~
Getting better, getting stronger, getting fitter and scoring goals. 

Good signs.

5192~~~
His finding his form and is working his socks off trying to get back full fitness, LVG if anything should have took him off against Spurs rather then today which was shocking when RVP was doing a disappearing act!

5193~~~
Inside I'm sure he's angry that he's always subbed off when Van Gaal's invisible mate RVP always stays on

5194~~~
He did the only thing worth talking about from our perspective: he scored. Everyone else on our side was shite in comparison.

5195~~~
Would like to see him get a handful games up front on his own. His touch was shit today but his movement and strength was there for all to see.

5196~~~
I'd like to see him up top on his own as well but we lack the wide players for a good 4-3-3 line-up right now. One thing I do like about Falcao is that he doesn't hide.

5197~~~
It's important he stays fit for the next weeks then his old form (Atletico Madrid days) should come.

Hopefully he starts against Yeovil and scores.

5198~~~
It's like watching Hernandez stumbling around the middle of the pitch to control the ball and make simple passes. He is a poacher, whose best work is done in and around the box. Why isn't VP coming deep with him staying up, when Robin is better suited to the role?

Has Falcao's touch always been this horrendous? It's like we are paying the same amount in 6 months that we paid for Hernandez in 3 years (Fees and wages included) for basically the same thing.

5199~~~
He looked like he was limping a little as he was walking off.

5200~~~
This, even his goal was Hernandez like. But he clearly isnt fit and sharp enough, when he gets to that, he'll probably be the improved version of Hernandez. My question then is, why not just keep Hernandez and let him improve, he would add pace too. I'm sure that if we got Hernandez minutes, confidence, stability, he would become one of the better strikers in the world.

5201~~~
I'm not so sure but yet again you might be right. Hernandez is still on loan so.. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5202~~~
7 starts, 3 goals 3 assists.  Not exactly a terrible return.

5203~~~
I think lots of people, myself included, would argue it's because he wasn't ever going to improve to that extent.

5204~~~
He had his limitations ofcourse, but at a certain period he was doing great, had an excellent return and was learning to become more than just a poacher, then RVP was signed and it just stopped. If SAF stayed longer, and player Chicha up top with Rooney, I dont know why Hernandez couldnt become a top class striker. Not saying he'd become Aguero, but he was still young for a striker, scoring goals at a big club, and the difference would be confidence. He had all the attributes, was quick, made runs behind the defence, solid header, poacher like instincts, driven, he was a solid finisher with both feet, after RVP, it looked like it all just regressed for him.

5205~~~
Tbh I don't think he was on his way to being more than a poacher, or at least not good at that role, though I agree he did improve. I always felt that when we asked him to do that he looked ill-at-ease with it. Technically he just didn't look suited.

5206~~~
Well last season, you could see him dropping in more often, trying to influence our play, trying to improve his link and hold up play. I dont think he'll become top class anymore, unless he just resets and goes to a club like Spurs/Everton/Leverkusen etc, but during the time when he was hot in form, still young and learning, gradually he could become a very good striker. O well, hasnt happened and we'll never know.

5207~~~
Had a proper mixed bag today. One minute he was holding the ball up beautifully, holding off 3 defenders and linking up really nicely. Displaying ridiculous strength in the process. The next he was showing a first touch that Emile Heskey would be proud of. Has he always been like this? So up and down?...He's also really quite slow. 

His goal was fantastically taken, but he's still not looking like a top top striker to me.

5208~~~
I think he's playing from memory. The great movement, and strikers instinct are still evident. However, he seems sluggish when running, and has not yet gained that devastating quickness of feet which made him a great striker. 

He seemed to be playing a lot better today than RvP, and was surprised he got substituted.

5209~~~
Not a great performance by any means but he was our best player today. He really tried hard to get into positions where he could cause Stoke's defenders problems, unfortunately he was the only one doing this. It was disappointing to see him go off but I'm sure van Gaal had his reasons behind this decision.

5210~~~
Seeing as he's still feeling his way back to match fitness it definitely made sense to sub him off, after three games in quick succession.

5211~~~
That doesn't mean much on a day most of our squad was flat out terrible and we had a poor performance overall. He wasn't clearly better than RVP either, who was also making some good runs, so I wouldn't disagree with his substitution. This is all pointless though. If we're to buy him, he has to show, and more than once, that he's a top class striker and he once again hasn't done that today. I don't wanna spend a ton of money on a player who won't end up being worth it.

5212~~~
What doesn't make sense is him playing deeper than Van Persie.

5213~~~
He doesn't even look like he can walk. Watch his slow walk. I am sure he limps!

5214~~~
A lot of people are comparing him to Hernandez, but Chicharito usually never got this involved in a game like Falcao does. Chicharito also had nowhere near the physical strength that Falcao has displayed, or the great link up passes that Falcao is able to make time to time. From what I remember, Chicharito especially in his last couple seasons was criticized a lot for being anonymous in games, and not contributing enough in the build up. I don't see that at all with Falcao. Falcao wants to get on the ball as much as possible, and often drops deep to get touches. He has been a lot more involved than RVP lately.

His touch has been extremely inconsistent but he was still doing more good out there today than bad. He plays with a lot of aggression and determination.

5215~~~
Clearly not 100% yet but still scoring goals, yet still getting criticised.

5216~~~
He is great, but he should really try to stay on his feet. Everytime he got the ball, he fell. I know it's Stoke and they practice wrestling, but it's not the first time.

5217~~~
There's a lot of things not making sense about the players bought in over the summer.

5218~~~
In a few matches, I wonder what Falcao with better fitness can do alongside Van Persie when Robin comes back. Not having both him and Di Maria available the last couple of games has really been hurting us.

5219~~~
a lot of love for this post. completely agree.

5220~~~
It usually takes about a year of recovery from a torn ACL.  I know its two different sports but Darrell Revis tore his in October of 2012, came back for the following NFL season in September and he just didn't look the same.  Fast forward to 2014 and he's the best cornerback in the NFL again.  My expectation is that next season, Falco will be the player from his Porto, Atletico days.  He'll score 30+ goals next season with all competitions.  We should invest IMO.

5221~~~
Whats a 25 goal striker at 29 worth? The answer is not £44 million. We paid half of that for Van Persie and he came to us as the best player in the league in his best ever form and clear of his injury troubles

Took his goal well today and looked a bit better on the ball.

5222~~~
I'm not thrilled with the price of fee but we should still do it.  Why?  What other option would we have for the No.9 role next season?  RVP will be 32 next season.  We can't solely rely on him or rapid development of Wilson.  25 goal strikers don't exactly grow on trees.  They're a wanted commodity hence the price.

5223~~~
Good job the fee looks like it's going to be €40m (£31m) then.

5224~~~
I don't think the fee is a big deal. We're not just buying stats. We'd be buying a player that other great players want to play with. It's a global game and we have to be as attractive as possible with how the games gone. Providing we can still do the business we need to then he's a good option providing he keeps fit and keeps scoring. The supporters like him, he seems happy here and I think with luck we'll see a better final third player with the right transfer dealings in the summer.

We need better quality through the spine of the team and better width. Yes he'd be expensive (providing we didn't try to renegotiate the price) but if we want to challenge Madrid, we have to push aside reason. They over paid for Bale but again who gives a shit? It's not the price you pay it's what they do on the pitch and off it. A season on who really thinks about the price they paid? Madrid don't. We got 80 Million for Ronaldo and 25 for Becks. Mugs.

If we can afford it, if he keeps fit and scores goals and it doesn't interfere with other transfer dealings just do the deal.

5225~~~
We will have to choose between Falcao and RvP, the audition of which will continue over the next few months.

5226~~~
Unless he regains the kind of form that he's shown in the past over the next few months I honestly don't see the sense in spending out big money for him in the hope that he will eventually rediscover it, the money could be better spent elsewhere.

5227~~~
I agree, we have to go with one or the other as playing them both plus Rooney and Mata leaves us very predictable and short on pace.

5228~~~
Life will go on if he does not stay here, but it seems like he wants to play here and fight for his place. Those are important traits, and in recent years we've struggled to attract top tier talent.

5229~~~
Correct me if i am wrong but didnt Stam suffer the same injury and it took him a couple of seasons to get back to his best including his burst of speed? Thats when Fergie regretted selling him. He thought it was good value for some one he had thought was on the decline.

5230~~~
Falcao is always up for a battle. surprised me. Hopefully he can regain his form and fitness, he isnt the old one yet. He slips often and his running is a bit awkward.
but i am optimistic that till the end of the season he will be worth buying permanently.

5231~~~
We could and clearly should be looking at all the other forwards out there and compiling a list of players who are far, far, far better value for money than Falcao - thats if we didnt already put the go ahead on signing him when we first did the loan deal. Of course there are plenty of strikers who we could get for that money and would be better for us than Falcao can be, due to his age.

Examples? Lacazette would suit playing with the players we have in forward areas better and cost half as much. He's young has a very good scoring record and would add the much needed pace to our forward line. Then there's for example Benzema, we could entice Madrid for that money and he's in better form and less fitness concerns. Sanchez was available in the summer and for that amount of money we could clearly have got him instead, his speed and versatility would have suited us more - obviously he's not an option anymore, but he was available in the summer so who knows who is available next summer? He was good at Barcelona last season and they let him go. Likewise Di Maria at Madrid, the money made it happen and £44 million is a huge amount. Paco Alcacer at Valencia could obviously be taken and for less than that price, he's a young man who will score lots of goals for club and country and can play his teammates in too. And this is all talking about forwards, in reality we have Van Persie still doing the business and Rooney can yet have his best seasons as a striker if he actually plays there. We could instead buy a top midfielder if we aren't happy with Ander playing Rooney's midfield role, then putting Rooney up front. And so on. 

The options are many and almost all of them make more sense than signing Falcao, who may yet get back to his best but even if he does it'll be for a short time and for an astronomical fee.

Personally the only deal I'd have an interest in is if A) Before the end of the season he goes on a high scoring run for 10 games or so showing he's back at his best for a short time (which I'm hopeful he'll do whether we sign him or not) and then B) At the end of the season we say "No, that figure is far too high. Take him back Monaco and call us when you're willing to talk realistic numbers for a 29 year old" and they get back to us with a figure in the ballpark region of what we paid for RVP. If that call doesn't come and he goes off to a 2nd tier team in Spain (Valencia, Sevilla, etc) or something then so be it

5232~~~
Precisely.I have no problem with the fee.Plus Falcao is a more much famous name than the likes of Lacazette so there's huge marketing potential as well.

5233~~~
surprised that he was withdrawn as he was much better than our other attackers and we were not winning too.

lack of quality from wide areas is obviously why we are not getting the best out of falcao. just look at his goals for porto and atletico where most of his goals came from quality crosses into the box, especially from open play, where falcao just used his movements to great effect.

5234~~~
SAF sold stam because he wrote some off stuff in his autobiography. It was not performance related.
SAF says he regrets selling stam to this day.

5235~~~
I really believe the first 2 substitutions were pre-planned. Van Gaal even mentioned that the Shaw one was planned (if United were winning it would probably have been Rafael rather than Adnan for Shaw). The biggest frustration just now is that United's team selection and substitutes are more based on getting 11 fit players on the pitch rather than making appropriate tactical changes.

5236~~~
I like him, but I don't see the case for spending 45 (and huge wages on him) instead of just bringing Chicharito back, especially with Rooney and Mata around. Falcao is a better player, but Hernandez is 2.5 years younger and healthier.

Our attack is just so slow and unvaried with him and RVP up top. Has to be one or the other, except against shit teams at home we are just trying to outscore.

5237~~~
Chicharito scores at the rate of a 25 goal striker. Not technically growing on a tree, but graspable...

5238~~~
A 25 goal a season striker who scored 59 goals in 4 seasons with us and only hit 20 goals once?

5239~~~
Besides not being the speed merchant anymore either. 

On Falcao, he's getting fitter, but clearly not there yet. His movement is still crisp. The rest will come with more match fitness.

5240~~~
Hernandez was really terrible towards the end of his spell here. Didn't look like he could be bothered anymore, Falcao at least you can tell is giving his all. If we do sign him permanently that might relieve some of the pressure on Falcao so he can enjoy his football a little more.

5241~~~
Surprised at people saying he was good and shouldn't have been subbed. He had some very nice moments but he also lost possession an awful lot and was blowing hard at 60 minutes.

5242~~~
For me, his first touch was pretty awful for the first 20 minutes or so. After that he seemed to grow into the game and I thought we looked poorer when he left the pitch.

Personally, I would have taken off Mata for Herrera.

5243~~~
Nah, that's no way near good enough for some on here. Even if he scored a goal a game, people would still find something to moan about......

5244~~~
Had a few starts now, probably still finding his feet in the prem alongside returning to fitness. Stats are pretty good. After a few games have people been impressed, underwhelmed or just okay.

New player in the prem, potentially I feel he's done okay, I think he still needs to have the one big game, where he completely dominates the opposition etc etc. Looks lively at times though and in a new league that's not always the case with big name strikers.

5245~~~
The worlds turned a few times since RVP, and contractually a completely different situation. Im don't give a toss what we pay for him cause transfers turned into monopoly money a long time ago and I'm equally not writing the cheque. This is no one season wonder type of player. He's (or was) arguable the best striker in the world for many a season. The reason he's here is purely timing and circumstance. If we are patient and support him to find his best form, maybe we might just have signed a player that's worth more than 44m even at 29. These players over the last few years rarely become available. It's a gamble I'm prepared to take cause the potential outcome is worth it.

5246~~~
Agree but that needs to be within the context of the team also. It's hard to assess any player at the moment, the teams constantly in a state of flux. The number of injuries has just made our season so disjointed.

5247~~~
I don't think him and RVP should play in the same 11. They are both 9s and the lack of bodies further back in the field means that most of the time RVP/Falcao receive a long ball and have to battle to hold it up and bring others into play. Hopefully one of them gets dropped for Herrera.

5248~~~
Not possible. For that kind of money you need to be at the top (as a striker) for a long period, he'll be 29 before the season is over and in 2 years would be Van Persie's age and have the same issue of being past his physical best. 

If he was 25 its another story but he's not. He has a short time at the top left - havent we learned from deals like Berbatov and Shevchenko that its hard for a striker in their very late 20s to go to a big club and succeed and deliver on their pricetags, because they have to literally hit the ground running and have brilliant seasons right from the beginning? Whereas 25-26 year olds can have a year or 18 months to settle in before they need to deliver. And despite this we're taking a player who will obviously not hit the ground running and will take a lot of time to reach his best, if hes even capable of it because of his injury.

5249~~~
Money has nothing to do with it. It guarantees nothing in transfers as it's not a science. You will have seen both signs of the coin as a utd fan. Age equally has no baring on it either. 'Settling down' has so many variables it's untrue...age, language, culture, family, the league, the team, the manager, your fitness and health, other commitments and international games....it's endless. 

I'm not sure why anyone would not just wait and see if it's successful or not. What is there to lose?

5250~~~
Hope. Or in this case, your mind. Why bother when its not possible?

He's obviously not going to look like a player thats worth more than £44 million like you said. Thats insanity. He can of course look like a top striker in his final years of physical peak, but you don't pay that kind of money for it.

5251~~~
Does it matter what we pay and if so why? It has no baring on you or me. Do you think any footballer is worth 250k a week? Let's keep it real, the sums don't matter anymore. If he fails, it will have no impact on nothing other than us potentially not qualifying for Europe as easily however, If he is a success, we might have signed a player that for his relatively short period of time here might be worth paying your sky subscription or season ticket to watch. Like I said, what's there to lose? I'm still pitching myself everytime I see him in a utd shirt. Let's dare to dream eh.....

5252~~~
I'd still like to check him out for a couple more months.
Someone posted that he was a 'handsome Tevez'. That wouldn't be such a bad thing.

5253~~~
I hope we keep him, for two reasons.

He's class. His record backs that up. And he wants to play for us.

Once the balance of the team is sorted when our midfielders are fit i suspect we will see a partnership of Rooney plus one of the other two up top, and I think that will work well for Falcao.

Wilson is not ready for the premiership this season, and especially is we maintain league position and have CL football next year, having Rooney,Falcao and VP will be a great strike force.

5254~~~
Yes it matters because our football club is a business and when you pay x amount of money, you want x amount of success to show it was worth the money. 

Else we might as well buy Emile Heskey for £50 million.

Money is also a precious resource to further strengthen to side and making sure we can compete with the top clubs. If we waste it on players who dont come close to delivering on what we paid, we have less money to fix that problem and those in other areas. And lets not forget that our financial situation isnt the best, even if we've been throwing the money around that cannot continue without concequences. The players need to deliver and make a lot of money on the pitch and they do that most easily by coming first or second in the league + champions league.

5255~~~
Eh? That's the most simplistic explanation of football economics I've ever read...you make the assumptions about money like your talking about your own bank account. Do you know what our ceiling is for net spending on transfers? If not, how do you know what's too much or too little? You talk about spending money like my wife talks about shopping at tesco......

5256~~~
Why do people keep mentioning this figure? I thought it was common knowledge that the £6 million loan fee will be subtracted from this if we make the deal permanent. That makes it £38 million which ain't bad nowadays. Only a few days ago Marca reported the fee will be less again so people shouldn't be saying he will cost £44 million as if it's a matter of fact. It's actually wrong.

5257~~~
At this rate, he'll be at a reasonable figure by the end of the season. Sounds very convenient given he hasnt quite got going yet.

All the reports were of the fee being £44 million at the time and its not going to change, thats the whole point of an agreed fee on a loan deal. Its just a convenient thing to placate fans to put out stories that a player who hasn't quite done the business yet is going to cost less money than originally reported, by everyone.

Of course I hope its true, but theres a reason why everyone was using that fee when we first announced the deal. Was everybody wrong? Thats unlikely.

5258~~~
And all those reports clearly stated that the £44 million included the £6 million loan fee which we have already paid. Unless I am misinterpreting what you've said, you, and to be fair many others, seem to be under the impression that if we want to buy him we have to pay £44 million in the summer. That's wrong. We have already paid £6 million of that figure. If we were to pay £44 million in the summer that would bring the entire fee up to £50 million, a figure which I don't think anybody has reported to be true.

5259~~~
The reports were of a loan fee and then an option of around £43.5 million additionally to make it permanent.

5260~~~
Have to agree with you,

I would much prefer a 4-3-2-1

-----------------Dave--------------------
Rafael--Smalling-----Jones-----Shaw--
------Herrera---Carrick---Rooney--------
-----------Di Maria--Mata---------------
-----------------Falcao-------------------

It's hard because we have Blind coming back and RVP is a fantastic striker to have in the squad but they don't really complement each other
and I would love to see proper service from Mata and Angel to Falcao, all Falcao is getting right now is long balls up to him and has to always try and
hold the ball.

5261~~~
Whether we've paid £6 million or not shouldn't be much of a concern. It won't bother me too much if we pay £6 million over what he's worth. 

What bothers me is paying a good £15-£20 million over his worth which is the case here

5262~~~
No decision has to be made for at least another 4 months. Shall we wait and see if he can deliver before labelling him a waste of money?

5263~~~
I agree 100% with this.
I think Falcao is decent and can be decent again. But for £45M (or whatever the proposed cost is), I think we are getting shafted.
I'm sure E.Woodward can get the price reduced, though. It depends if any other club is willing to pay more than we are.

Okay, here's another question: for those who think that Falcao is not worth £45M, for that price tag, who would you suggest, as an alternative? Remember, we need a ready made striker who can compete to win the league and CL.

5264~~~
I agree that in this case we should be able to negotiate the price down despite us agreeing to a set fee, like we did with Tevez. Who is going to pay that fee? And with a much more reasonable lower fee (and the inevitable return to form of Falcao, eventually) I'd be on board with taking him. Its just the current deal is way off the mark.

5265~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11069084/Radamel-Falcao-completes-loan-move-to-Manchester-United-in-transfer-worth-up-to-20-million-for-one-season.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...er-worth-up-to-20-million-for-one-season.html</a>

In this article Mark Ogden says that we had agreed to buy him for £35 million at the end of the loan. He is generally considered to be as reliable as they come in terms of United. It was either him or Taylor that said the loan fee was part of the agreed permanent fee. 

So you think he is only worth £25 million tops?

5266~~~
That was the day he signed, there were loads of prices flying round that day for him. However, I already posted a later article from the same paper which along with (<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11299114/Man-Utd-transfers-Radamel-Falcao-warns-Louis-van-Gaal-he-must-play-if-he-is-to-stay-at-Old-Trafford.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...st-play-if-he-is-to-stay-at-Old-Trafford.html</a>) show it as a £43.5 million additional option. Ogden may not have written them but they're from his newspaper. The reality is it doesn't really matter. If he stays the way he is we shouldn't be going anywhere near those prices, especially given how high his wages are, but he could be a superb signing for us if he returns to being the incredible player he was at Atletico. Sadly seems unlikely currently.

5267~~~
Love how people manipulate simple facts.

Taking last season aside (serius injury at Monaco, where he still scored 11 in 19 games overall) - his tally's are:
- 2012/13 - 34 goals
- 2011/12 - 36
- 2010/11 - 38
- 2009/10 - 36

Don't forget that he added 2 goals in 3 games before joining us, with 3 goals and 3 assists during his first season in England with only 7 starts.

Falcao is proven 35-40 goals a season striker when used properly - that's a fact.
For me he's been the best #9 in football for last 5 years or so, and that kind of players are very, very rare. 

Given his age, 30-35m should be a fair price. If he comes good for second part of season, I wouldn't mind paying 40m for him.

5268~~~
If he gets back to his goalscoring form thats the ballpark figure for a 29 year old thats going to win you the league ala Van Persie yes. 

I know you can make the argument that fees have gone up since we signed Van Persie, but you can also make the argument that Van Persie was clearly the best player in the league and Falcao can't be considered anywhere near that. Van Persie didn't have long left on his contract, Falcao has made it clear he wanted to leave Monaco and theres no way he'll go back to playing there.

I'd also remove the "only" part. £25 million is a lot for a player with a few years left at his physical peak, there are only a handful of examples of players that age moving clubs for so much money and even less that have done it and proven worth it.

5269~~~
What do his numbers prior to his injury have to do with anything? Do you have proof that it won't effect him? That crystal ball must be really handy.

25 goals is just a more realistic (but still extremely hopeful/positive) expectation given he has to adapt to a new league and is unlikely to be 100% what he was before. Thats a lot of goals

5270~~~
As you say RVP only had a year left on his contract. He would have cost £35+ million easily otherwise. £25 million doesn't get a whole lot for you these days. If we got three good years out of him (which is the minimum I'd expect) then £25 million would be a snip.

5271~~~
Plenty of people made the point that we paid too much for RVP in the first place. 

And again Falcao has circumstances of his own, A) not fully fit B) not at his best, may not physically be able to be C) he's done at Monaco. They tried to get Real Madrid and when that didnt work out, they made sure he went to United. If we dont sign him, he's not going back to Monaco he's going to the highest bidder that he's going to accept playing for (he'll obviously have to give the go-ahead). Its more complicated than having a year on his contract, but he's clearly done at Monaco and is just as available as RVP was.

5272~~~
The difference is that I am basing on a fachts and you are not, as it's only your prediction.

I have no idea how his injury's gonna affect him, what I know is Falcao scored 6 goals since returning (3 for United and 2 for Monaco and 1 for Colombia) and looks sharper every single game in the most physical demanding league in the world.

Also remember that Falcao was always a main striker, so his previous managers were always building a side around him.
Here the situation is much different with Van Persie playing in an exact same position, so it will be hard for Falcao to show 100% of his efficiency.

5273~~~
Its a fact of how he did before the major injury thats stopped him playing to the same level, will take a while to recover from and may impede him in the future. We arent able to sign pre-injury Falcao and even if we could there's no guarantee that he'd score the exact same amount of goals in the premier league, in a different system to what he's had at Atletico

I just presented a far more managable haul thats far more likely to be achieved, if we're very lucky

5274~~~
Isn't he on loan for two seasons or does it run out at the end of this one?

5275~~~
One season.

5276~~~
This. On current showing Falcao should be worth no more than £25m including the original 6m.

Diego Costa is worth £30m, Sanchez £40m - it's utterly mental to be paying more for Falcao than we could've bought those two for.

5277~~~
Costa is easily worth more than that. Only reason Chelsea got for so cheap is because of his release clause. I'd value him and Sanchez at £45-50 million.

5278~~~
Lots of people arguing that he is not worth the money and we are overpaying by £10-£15 million. Since when is a club like United worrying over £10-£15 million? We spent far more on the likes of Zaha, Obertan, Bebe, Powell, etc - some of whom might make a decent mid-table players and no more.

No matter what you might say about his performances for us so far, he is the 11th most productive player in the whole league when it comes to minutes per goal or assist - here are the stats of the first 11 most productive players in the EPL plus some other notable players:

Rank---Player-------Minutes per goal or assist---(Total minutes/Total goals or assists)
1---Frank Lampard----61-(364/6)
2---Sergio Agüero-----62-(1053/17)
3---Papiss Cissé-------64-(635/10)
4---Didier Drogba-----72-(289/4)
5---Ramires-----------85-(340/4)
6---Stevan Jovetic----88-(617/7)
7---Olivier Giroud-----92-(460/5)
8---Diego Costa-------96-(1444/15)
9---Ángel Di María----96-(868/9)
10-Alexis Sánchez----99-(1589/16)
11-Falcao-------------101-(604/6)

13-Cesc Fàbregas----105-(1687/16)
14-Harry Kane-------109-(983/9)
17-Wayne Rooney---116-(1397/12)
22-David Silva-------144-(1149/8)
24-Eden Hazard-----147-(1761/12)
26-van Persie-------159-(1594/10)
29-Juan Mata-------165-(1323/8)
33-Graziano Pellè---177-(1772/10)
39-Andy Carroll-----187-(749/4)
41-Romelu Lukaku--193-(1540/8)
51-Raheem Sterling-215-(1717/8)
55-Danny Welbeck--233-(1399/6)
60-Sturridge---------270-(270/1)
64-Benteke----------298-(895/3)

Looking at these stats I can say for certain that the only striker I would have instead of Falcao is Agüero. There are a few others with better stats like Costa, Giroud, Cissé and Drogba, but lets not forget that they are usually the focal point of their teams attacks hence they get far more chances than Falcao. Sánchez is probably the only exception and he looks very good too and I would definitely have him, but not instead of Falcao, because he is not a striker imo. Kane has lower stats, but considering his age he looks very good too.

5279~~~
Great points and exactly what people should look at, no-one seems to batter a eyelid at the waste of money on Zaha especially, we've got nothing in return.

Looking at that list he is 1 behind Alexis where Falcao is playing at 60% of his best. Granted he might not be the same as he was when he was the best no.9 in the world but he has never relied on pace or taking on 2-3 players to score, he's not going to be Aguero, but can many strikers score complete goals like Falcao? 
Those attributes do not go away, if he stays injury free he will get 10 more premier goals for certain..

5280~~~
So, you're saying you'd reject a swap deal of Costa for Falcao...?

5281~~~
That's not what I'm saying - I'm saying that Agüero is definitely a better player, while Costa might also be better, but things are not that clear cut.

5282~~~
No, you said that the only PL striker you'd 'have instead of Falcao is Aguero' - thus, you'd reject a swap deal for Falcao and any other PL striker - which is mental.

5283~~~
Just because a player is doing better elsewhere doesn't mean you'd take him here, e.g. would you take Neuer over De gea right now? I wouldn't..

5284~~~
I said the only one I would have for certain is Agüero, because he has amazing stats and also plays in a front two. Costa has been great too, but I'm not so sure he will be able to have the same impact if he has to play upfront with RVP, like Falcao.

5285~~~
Everyone wants to see an instant return from falcao but it will take time.  I think that LVG is managing his return to full fitness very well.  To be able to play at the intensity he does in the most physical league in the world will take time.  Once he is there I believe he will be the main striker and RVP will become more of a back-up.

5286~~~
Most recent reports suggest the fee will be £31M. 

I hope we snap him up at the value ASAP.

5287~~~
Just spent the last hour at work watching videos of him on YouTube. I want him to succeed as much as anyone but he looks a million miles away from the player he was at the moment (which is understandable given the injury etc). If he gets back to anywhere near his old self though then the figure quoted would be a steal. Big if, mind.

5288~~~
In that case why ever sign anyone? 

And yeah, Falcao's showing thus far is comparable to DDG's form isn't it?

Diego Costa is a world class bully of a striker who's taken to the PL like a duck to water, if we had him spearheading our attack we'd be better off than we are now. Anyone suggesting they'd reject an immediate swap deal of Falcao for Costa is talking utter nonsense to borderline troll levels, or is deluded.

5289~~~
Dude, no one is saying that Costa is not having a great season so far, but lets not forget that he is playing as a focal point of a 4-5-1 at a very dominant Chelsea team with the most creative midfield players behind him. Falcao on the other hand didn't have a pre-season with us, is returning from serous injury, struggled with fitness, half of his minutes are in very short cameos, plays in a defensively set-up 3-5-2 and still managed to produce almost as many goals/assist per minute as Costa. I think Falcao is the better player and once he returns to 100% he will surpass him in the EPL the same way he did when both of them played at Atletico.

5290~~~
Good point and with Arsenal and Liverpool sniffing around for a striker that would be devastating if we payed for his rehab and they reap the rewards!!!

5291~~~
He is a superstar too. He is worth a lot off the pitch as well as on it.

5292~~~
He definitely 'looks right' in a United shirt, I'll give him that. He looks like someone's second attempt at making Carlos Tevez.

5293~~~

5294~~~
I wouldn't swap Falcao for Costa either. I wouldnt want Costa's ugly mug anywhere near OT.

5295~~~
<a class="username" data-user="50019, @Dion" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/50019/">@Dion</a> - there are no guaranties in football. It's clear that he is not at 100%, but even the below par Falcao is the 11th most productive player in the league ahead of the likes of Benteke, Sturridge, Welbeck, Sterling, Lukaku, Pellè, RVP, Rooney, Mata and many more. He can only get better with regular football, but even if he doesn't fully return to his Atletico form, he is still better than the available alternatives.

5296~~~
Worth remembering too that all Falcao's assists this year have been proper assists where he put the goal on a plate for his colleagues.

5297~~~
Im going to stick my neck out and say in 12 months time Falcao will be our starting striker and RVP will be clear second choice, maybe even by May. Its a long time since weve had a striker as instinctive as him, and its clear even with his injuries the movement is still there even if the finishing is abit rusty.

5298~~~
He is improving but still think we are a worse team when we try to play him and RVP together and price is too high to sign him permanently. Would like to see him given the opportunity to play up front without RVP and see how he gets on but we seem determined to shoe horn them both in.

5299~~~
My guess and belief is that the 6 million loan fee is part of what it would cost to buy him permanently.  If it was 6 million plus an additional 44 million, that would be 50 million pounds, the figure Monaco paid for him when he was undoubtedly the best no.9 in the world.  Considering the fact that he put up decent, not spectacular numbers at Monaco last season and that he was coming off a torn ACL, I highly doubt we would have to invest 50 million quid on Falcao.  If that was the case, we would've bought him after his Atletico days.

5300~~~
I reckon by next year he will be a beast - and next year is when we really should be able to mount a title push. I really think we should keep him (money is meaningless wrt our status financially).

5301~~~
Really hard to decide where to stand as far as the permanent signing of him is concerned.
I see glimpses of what he was and that really makes me hopeful. Then again the money talked about could probably be spent more wisely. 
I've a soft spot for him though as he is working his bollox off and his stats so far aren't half bad either but it's obviously important for him to improve in the new year if he wants to stay with us, and even more important to stay fit.

5302~~~
So do I.

5303~~~
Hows Balotelli working out?

5304~~~
I think the supply lines need to improve to see the best of him. This pedestrian possession type of play really doesn't suit his game at all.

5305~~~
As others have said, I think playing him right up top through the middle, supported by a second striker/AM and with a couple of dangerous wingers either side of him would suit him more.

He's having to do an awful lot of the build-up play himself now, drifting wide and stretching defences, taking care not to move into RVP territory. It's not what he's good at. Getting the job done in and around the box is.

5306~~~
Not well. Why?

5307~~~
I thought you were suggesting Falcao has been a flop, or that at £31 million he would be over priced. If you were saying that Liverpool should bid £31 million for him then I've misinterpreted what you said.

5308~~~
I'm saying that £31m is a terrible price for Falcao given his age and clear decline caused by his injuries. Not sure what Balotelli has got to do with that.

5309~~~
Well we've got loads of money so #yolo

5310~~~
if I had a say i would do everything in my power to grab reus instead if it was a possibility. although im sure we have yet to see the best of falcao.

5311~~~
£31M is a terrible price for one of the best number 9's in the world. Ok then.

5312~~~
I'll have one of each please.

Edit - Glad my 3000th post was good'un!

5313~~~
What clear decline? He is just finding his way back from a serious injury and acclimatising to a new league yet has contributed 3 goals and 3 assists in 7 starts. If he hasn't improved by this time next year then yes he has declined in comparison to his Athletico days but to say there has been a "clear decline" based on a handful of performances is just laughable really. I mentioned Balotelli because ye paid £16 million for a complete dud yet you think we would be mad to pay less than half that for an infinitely better player in Falcao.

This. I only rate Suarez and Aguero higher.

5314~~~
Stop whinging. It's feckin obvious he's class. The goals will come. The fee is irrelevant.

5315~~~
Exactly, and before 2014, Falcao was rated higher then both.

5316~~~
Ya while he was out injured they both improved rapidly.

5317~~~
We need to fix our defence (allowing the CM to create rather than continually help defend) and midfield composition (i.e. play Herrera more and play Rooney less) and then both he adn RvP will score more as the chances increase.

5318~~~
He's not one of the best number 9s in the world any more, that's the point.

5319~~~
Yes he is, he's still quite easily top 5.

5320~~~
It's clear to anyone who watched him regularly at Atleti, he's a complete shadow of that player.

5321~~~
Yup, they had outstanding 2014's.

5322~~~
Falcao: 604 minutes played, 3 goals + 3 assists; 101 minutes per goal or assist
Balotelli: 737 minutes played, 0 goals + 0 assists; infinity minutes per goal or assist (737 / 0 = infinity)

5323~~~
Yeah, again that's cool but I've never said anything about Balotelli being a good signing.

5324~~~
I don't think we should compare Falcao to Balotelly, seems to be degrading Falcao immensely.

5325~~~
When exactly was he the best number 9 in the world?

2011/12 RVP was waay better
2012/13 I'd still say RVP was better, Lewandowski was better as well
2013/14 Suarez, Aguero, Ibrahimovic, Costa
2014/15 Aguero, Costa

I'd maybe but Falcao top 2/3 from 2011/13 but not sure if he was the best overall no 9, definitely up there though

5326~~~
Falcao at Porto was the best number 9 in the world and then confirmed that at Atleti as people wanted him to prove himself in a tougher league (not Portuguese liga) and he proved it.

5327~~~
Bit of an exaggeration, there. Some would argue Falcao was better, some would say RvP. But to say RvP was <i>way </i>better is a tad far.

As VanGaalEra said, he was the best #9 in the world at Porto, then continued his ways at Atletico. He pretty much brought through Atletico through the Europa league group stages and scored a vital goal almost every game there, as well as ripping apart Chelsea in the Super Cup. These moments were evident that he was one of the top #9s in the world, and certainly was at one stage or another. What can definitely be said is that he has been one of the most consistent.

5328~~~
Based on what 600 minutes of football? Suarez has had a poor start to his career at Barcelona yet I'm not saying he is a shadow of the player he was at Liverpool even though based on his performances so far for Barcelona that's exactly what he is. I am able to recognise that he has only played a few games there and is settling into a new team and league. To say he is in decline would be ridiculous. The same applies to Falcao (even more so due to his injury). It's clear to any reasonable person that you cannot judge a player based on a handful of appearances, especially one who is recovering from a serious injury and playing for a new team in a new country. As I said earlier if he is playing like this in 6-12 months then yes he has declined. To say he has declined based on a handful of appearances is both stupid and wrong. Anyone that thinks that is either an unreasonable United fan/bitter opposition fan or has a very limited knowledge of football.

5329~~~
I think the whole point is it's extremely ironic for a Liverpool fan on a United forum to say Falcao has been a flop (when he hasn't) while ye lot made signed two strikers in the summer for a combined fee of just under £20 million and they have managed the grand total of one league goal between them.

5330~~~
You're preaching to a crowd who won't reason. Many fans (myself included at times) will write players off or suddenly change their opinion about someone. It defies logic, but just how people are.

5331~~~
There is no irony, Balotelli and Lambert being wank makes no difference to the fact that Falcao looks nowhere near the player he was two seasons ago and hasn't proved his worth to sign permanently. Bob Loblaw hasn't stated Falcao has been a flop at all, nor has he even mentioned Balotelli.

5332~~~
Dividing by zero isn't infinity, it's disallowed. Just like a goal would probably be if Balotelli were to ever score one again.

5333~~~
As an out and out goal scorer, Falcao was better than RvP and Lewandowsk in 11/12 and 12/13. From 12/13 season:

40 apps for Falcao, scored 34 goals.
49 apps for Lewandowski, 36 goals.
48 apps for RvP with 30 goals scored.
If you take assist stats into consideration, then Lewandowski + RvP would edge it, but that's not really Falcao's game. He's a proper goal scoring no.9.

Anyway, Falcao's stats from the last few season put him up there with any striker you care to name.

5334~~~
He's still 3rd all time in Goals Per Minute in Prem history, I think, behind Aguero and Henry. Give him a normal starting season and I would expect him to hit 25 in all comps. 

He's not as good as Falcao, but considering the age gap, Falcao's health issues, the massive wages gap and probably a 30 million difference in selling off Hernanez and bringing in Falcao, and it's hard for me to see the case for not spending that cash on buying off Reus' agent or or hitting Laporte's release clause or whatever other positive thing we could do with the cash.

5335~~~
On 2012-2013 he was the best number 9 in the world. Better than RVP and likely better than Lewandovski. It also can be argued that he was the best striker in the world in 2011-2012, though I would say that RVP was slightly (no waay) better. On Porto he was great too.

5336~~~
It's like some people here want him to fail. Really odd. Whenever I see him and RVP together Falcao is the one that impresses me more. More hustle, more desire, more creativity. And this is from a player in a new team, new league, and not at 100%. What do people actually expect?

5337~~~
They play different roles, especially together. RVP's discipline to stretch the backline allows his strike parter and the attacking players more space to work in. If he came to the ball all the time like Falcao the defence could just press and never have to worry about whats in behind them. He also holds on the ball better with defenders at his back.

If Falcao did those things brilliantly, we wouldnt need RVP in the lineup

5338~~~
Same here. RVP has looked disinterested and off pace all season, but because he gets a lot more minutes, scores more goals. If Falcao looked as awful as RVP has, everyone would be burning Old Trafford down to send him back to Monaco! Robin's unwillingness to give up the ball when he has even a sliver of a look at goal also makes it worse for Falcao.

Van Gaal also has made some ridiculous decisions with his substitutions of Falcao (like in the Stoke game), and has refused to play him with Wilson or anybody other that RVP up front.

5339~~~
Well, he's shown enough for me all things considered ( new league, injuries etc etc). He's absolute class IMO and probably the best 'natural' finisher/no 9 we've had since RVN. i just hope he gets the chance to prove it.....

5340~~~
With what he's shown thus far!?

That's a bit unfair on RvP who's fired us to our 20th title, and Rooney who's been a far, far better 9 for us than Falcao has thus far.

Hell, Javier Hernandez, who cost us £6m scored <b>20 goals</b> for us in his debut season - something that no-one had done since Ruud. 

Falcao's a long way off Hernandez's debut season at present and people are saying he's the best #9 we've had since Ruud and that we should shell out £40m for what we've seen thus far!? Ridiculous, get some perspective.

I want Falcao to succeed, but he needs a <i><b>massive</b></i> 2nd half of the season to justify us signing him imo.

5341~~~
The majority of the posts in this thread are entirely based on what he's done in the past, what he's doing/performing now, seems irrelevant. ..

5342~~~
He's been injured and hasn't started the majority of games. Imo it would be unfair to judge him in the limited game time he has had for us. He seems to be fit now, so lets see what he can do. ...

5343~~~
He reminds me of Forlan when Forlan was at united, but a career in reverse. Supremely talented but nothing seems to come off and even he can't believe it at times.

I would say that I think we'll get the best out of falcao when the service improves dramatically. You really need to put the ball in the danger zone 10-15 times a game to get the most out of a predator like falcao or someone like hernan crespo, but we just pass it back and forth between smalling and evans

When young gets down the line and whips a decent ball in falcao nearly always omes close to making something happen. His movement is excellent and he just throws himself at the ball. If this happened far more often he'd be banging them in

5344~~~
you can't help but think the old style of 4-4-2 with 2 quality wingers constantly creating chances would have suited him down to the ground.

the current style doesn't really at all.

5345~~~
He's having a shocking game today. Sad to see. In fairness he's not the only one, but he just doesn't look at the races here.

5346~~~
Wilson is definitely a lot brighter and more effective so far

5347~~~
Whoever pays £30+ million for him needs their head checking a shadow of the player he was 

We have the exact same player in rvp that's similar in everyway.

5348~~~
I don't think smalling smashing the ball up into the hole for him to challenge for is really his gme

5349~~~
Works hard, good finisher and great attitude but he can't run.

5350~~~
Give me Bony for half the price any day.

5351~~~
Poor fecker runs like he's got an anchor chained to his leg.

5352~~~
Weak, slow, poor hold up play, absent, really poor match from him and he needs to earn his place. Start Rooney up front next match.

5353~~~
One of the top 5 strikers in the world, folks.

That chance around 30mins where he was outsprinted by a Yeovil defender was sad to see. That knee injury's ruined him as a top level striker.

5354~~~
Abysmal today, not surprising you scored minutes after he went off.

5355~~~
He has lost some pace, too slow for us, would be better off somewhere like Madrid where he can just stand in and around the box and wait for service.

It would be ridiculous for us to consider signing him for anything like 30-40m.

5356~~~
Spot on, that was truly sad to see.

5357~~~
If he gets no service he won't get the goals. Simple

5358~~~
Didn't think he was as bad today as some are saying, although I was never a fan of this transfer in the first place. He puts in a shift, utilises his strength and shows good movement in the final third. Obviously rusty but that is expected.

I do feel that had we kept Hernandez or Welbeck this season instead of getting Falcao our attack would have much more versatility to it, due to their pace.

5359~~~
Times running out for Falcao. I think maybe that's why he's started every game for us recently. We need to at least give him games to see what he's about these days. At 29 with a major injury over the last year, there's no way he's staying here past May.

5360~~~
At his best at Atletico, was he quick back then?

5361~~~
He's never been a speed merchant.

5362~~~
Only player to do anything going forward in the first half for us.

5363~~~
Looking forward to him and ADM in the same team, can see ADM racking up a lot of chances for him.

5364~~~
Standards must be rock bottom if that's considered doing something.

5365~~~
I dont even think his movement or strength was good today either, always seemed to be in the wrong place. Honestly reminds me of the way Torres played for us with the awful touches and never being in the right place.

5366~~~
Well I'm only comparing him to the other attackers on the pitch today. He held the ball up, looked like he megged a player and opened the play up on the right side. 

It wasn't spectacular by any means but more than Wilson or Rooney in the first half. A lot of us are judging Falcao to very different standards than other United players right now. 
He has always thrived on service and isn't getting much at all.

5367~~~
He has a better eye for goal than current day Torres, but there are a few worrying similarities at present.

5368~~~
Yeah I'd say if he was on the pitch herrera wouldn't have been able to score that great team goal

5369~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Well, he did shoot right through the spot where Falcao would have been standing, so yeah he did make a difference! <span style="color: #ffffff">...</span>

5370~~~
Wilson was our best player in the first half, doing thrice as much as Falcao

5371~~~
Wilson looked very sharp in the first half. Falcao... didn't.

His lack of pace was brutally exposed when Wilson played him through. Looked like he was running through treacle.

5372~~~
Looks very weak physically which is worrying.

5373~~~
Didn't look that good today, but to be fair few of our players did. I think he is gonna lose his starting place to Di Maria.

5374~~~
the alarm bells are definitely ringing here.

We either need to change our style of play or accept he'll only score a handful of goals this season.

5375~~~
I don't see how this current Falcao is going to suddenly transform into a player close the the one he used to be at his peak. He's just not good enough anymore. Spending half a season in France and half a season injured has clearly transformed him for the worse.

5376~~~
I'll say it again, his legs have gone.

5377~~~
I've been one of his defenders and I really want him to succeed here, but he just looked so awkward today, sad to see.

5378~~~
His tiredness obviously wasn't the excuse in last few games as many people suggested considering van Gaal insists on playing him even when he doesn't have to.

5379~~~
No edge today.

5380~~~
Have there been many players who after having suffered a terrible injury like rupturing their ACL, have gotten back to their best ?

5381~~~
I'm a massive fan, but he isn't good enough to pay anything 30m upward, currently I am not sure, if I'd pay 20m for him.

5382~~~
Been hopeful for him to show a return to form. His stock definetly dropped today: looked off the pace and got knocked off the ball too easily.  With Mata's recent form, hard to see Rooney not playing striker with RvP, Mata at #10 when AdM is ready to play with the first XI.

5383~~~
He'll learn a valuable lesson from today. In England, sometimes referees allow wrestling matches whether you want to be involved or not. Next time round I'll expect him to be wiser to it.

5384~~~
Defintely isnt worth money hes getting, you only pay thatmoney for game changers

Look at Di Maria, I have no problem with him, hes always getting assists or goals, Falcao not so much, money should be better spent elsewhere or on younger, faster striker

Loan deal was smart business, at least we`ll see till April how good he can be

5385~~~
You don't hear 'thrice' enough these days.

5386~~~
Still far too early to be writing him off.

And it'll only take a few corking goals against the likes of Southampton, QPR and Leicester over the coming weeks and he'll be 'world class' again.

5387~~~
Eh? He's got one of the best G+A per minutes in the premier league, what are you on about?

Did not look great today at all. Perhaps a sit on the bench and a fight for his place is needed. I still hold hope.

5388~~~
We don't create bugger all, so how are strikers meant to make such a big impact? His touch and hold up play has been a bit dodgy but he's always been at his best putting the ball in the net and we don't create near enough for him to do it. Di Maria coming back into the team will give him more chances, as he's the only one who doesn't turn his back to goal and pass to our defenders all the time.

5389~~~
Dribbling and hold up play was decent, but the Yeovil defender outpacing him to the ball down the left side of the box was worrying. Thought it was a goal at first, but was quite similar to the chance against Spurs, without being able to switch it back onto his right foot.

Movement in the box is great though, nearly got on the end of the Wilson ball. Can still score probably 10-15 a season just doing that alone.

5390~~~
Let's be honest, his performances haven't been good enough regardless of price. Price with him doesn't even matter especially in one sense. He's not an investment that we can sell on. He's being bought for performances alone. The only question remaining is whether his performances improve sufficiently.

5391~~~
True. I was thinking the money we could waste on him could be used elsewhere and where it could be of better use.

5392~~~
I suppose that the strikers of his value should be able to create something out of thin air, especially against such inferior side. I'm a big fan though, and we shouldn't be judging him now - it's a serious injury and the full recovery will take months (as it should).

5393~~~
Van Nistelrooy: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/apr/28/newsstory.sport8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/apr/28/newsstory.sport8</a> - He was pretty good after the injury as you should remember.

Xavi: <a class="externalLink" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2005/SPORT/football/12/02/spain.xavi/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://edition.cnn.com/2005/SPORT/football/12/02/spain.xavi/</a> - became a part of the best midfield in the world for club and country after his ACL injury.

Alan Shearer: "His first season with Blackburn was mixed – he missed half of it through injury after snapping his right <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">anterior cruciate ligament</a> in a match against <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_A.F.C." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leeds United</a> in December 1992."- wikipedia. Became top PL scorer after that.

The list goes on. Del Piero, Mikel Arteta, Roberto Baggio, Phil Jagielka. There are players who never recovered fully like Vidić but the word is that ACL injuries are no longer such a disaster as they were 20 years ago.

5394~~~
Not yet convinced either way.

The lack of pace with him and van Persie worries me as a long term option, so we might be better served using the financial outlay on someone who can give us that speed up there. We're woefully short of pace without Di Maria. We do get some from Wilson but he's obviously still quite raw.

Time will tell.

5395~~~
Put him and his fecking wages on a plane back to Monaco. The guy is clearly not fit to play in England. It was all hype and no substance.

5396~~~
Thanks, very informative. I remember Ruud very well, didn't take too long to be at his best. Weren't most of the guys you mentioned younger than Falcao when it happened to them ? Not that it's saying much, just wondering is all.

5397~~~
One of his best attributes is his heading, if we aren't going to play with width and put in lots of crosses I don't see why he is even starting, especially alongside RVP. Was worth a gamble on a loan but barring a spectacular finish to the season we shouldn't even consider buying him.

Got to wonder if he will keep his place now di Maria is back, I always thought mata would make way but it could be falcao instead.

5398~~~
I'd like to see him get some game time with Mata, ADM and Herrera on the pitch.

5399~~~
Would anyone take him for 30 million pounds based on what we've seen so far?

5400~~~
Nope.

5401~~~
Looks light weight.

5402~~~
Van Nisterlooy was 24, Xavi 25, Alan Shearer 22, Del Piero 24, Jagielka 27, Arteta 27. I think Walcott had the same injury one year ago and today is his first game after the injury. Was good at the start of the match but because i was posting that i wasn't watching the game closely in last half an hour.

Baggio was 18 and again at the age of 34. This part of the wikipedia is surprised me about Baggio: "At the start of <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A_2001%E2%80%9302" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2001–02 season</a>, he scored eight goals in the first nine games, leading him to the top of the Serie A goalscoring table, and forming a formidable offensive partnership with <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Toni" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Luca Toni</a>. Unfortunately, during that season, he tore the <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">anterior cruciate ligament</a> and <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">meniscus</a> in his left knee twice, a serious injury which put his chances of playing at the upcoming World Cup in jeopardy. Despite this severe injury, he came back three games before the end of the season, making a record recovery of 76 days.".

Falcao was 27 nearing his 28 birthday in february (he injuried in january). So he was a little older but not to much. He will be 29 next month so time is not on his side and he must find his form back quickly.

5403~~~
Haven't really seen much from him that excites me.  Love his hair though.

5404~~~
And Hernandez had best goals per minute in league, and he scored like 12-15 in SAF last season, all mostly as a sub, I mean money being thrown around about how much Falcao costs is pretty ludicrous 

Hes not really set PL alight has he

5405~~~
Never said those words, just pointing out a statement which may be, or in other words is, incorrect.

5406~~~
Tick tock.  Nowhere near good enough to purchase this guy.  How many more games does he get?.  Unfortunately for him, when the buyout fee and weekly wages are ludicrously high, and you don't perform well enough to standout against much lower opposition, then you get to go back from whence you came...

5407~~~
This is also the 3rd time Falcao has torn knee ligaments

5408~~~
Missed that. I know that he torn it one time before. This makes me a lot more negative about it. I wouldn't pay 30m pounds for him but i think we will do it.

5409~~~
Looks slow and weak in this country. No way should we buy him based on what I've seen.

5410~~~
He is resembling Torres. He has received praise for his link up play (which was non-existent today) and for flashes of quality yet just like Torres he hesitates and messes up attacks in the box. I think he is fearful of getting clattered hence why he looks so slow in pursuit of balls. See, Torres at Chelsea just was too wasteful in front of goal when he had the chances, and more often or not games would pass by where he wouldn't give himself the opportunity to score because he was always behind the tempo of the game. I see this in Falcao. Torres at Chelsea ran the channels, which freed up other players but at that price you have to contribute and unfortunately for Falcao time is running up.

5411~~~
All the more reasons not to make the deal permanent IMHO.

5412~~~
Doom and fecking gloom on here today! If we let him go after the season having built his fitness up and basically rehab, how would you guys feel if the dippers buy him and he goes on to be a 25/30 goal striker?

5413~~~
You have to back your judgement on a player not be scared that they may prove you wrong later.

5414~~~
So you don't think he will return to scoring ways again? You have to remember we have been poor and we are second in the hoof ball table. Do you think it's right to judge him when his not getting the service any goal scorer needs?

5415~~~
To me it looks like he has completely lost the quickness of feet and touch in tight areas which allowed him to be a deadly goalscorer.

I'm sure he could still score 20 goals a season with the right service, but personally I doubt even then he would be worth close to the price he will cost.

5416~~~
I was torn apart in this thread when I said he lacked pace when he was signed. Found it strange how the majority of cafers described him as pacy and fast.

5417~~~
I agree and that's why I'm suggesting it's already a done deal. We knew the rehab of players after such an injury would take time so as you say, why would we spend most of the season managing and even worse than that, paying for it. Don't think so. This is a done deal.....

5418~~~
Why is it fair on other players to constantly give big names protection? With some its always ' hes not getting the service' or ' the whole team played badly'.

The Falcao I know didnt need  impeccable service, he just isnt good with his touch anymore and  has lost the explosiveness. I assume LVG  isnt planning to feature him next week as it seemed a bit odd having him out there today. I dont think I have ever seen him look so poor.

5419~~~
It's hard to analyse the situation when he just doesen't look fit.

5420~~~
Still looks like he's struggling with the pace of games. If he was a cheap punt I'd say go for it but for the money reported, he hasn't shown enough (yet).

5421~~~
he got bossed today by a league one clogger, his touch was so heavy it was ridiculous

I read a lot of reports when he arrived saying the deal was already done and the loan was just a clever way around ffp for monaco but if its not already a done deal you have to think they'll be people at the club having serious second thoughts right now.

I don't doubt his finishing is still intact but at the moment he simply doesn't have the ability to get into the game and on the end of chances.
there's still plenty of time left in the season for him to come good though and I think he will

5422~~~
Brilliant, knowing that in another year they'll have to start thinking about replacing a player they bought for far too much money

5423~~~
Not saying he played well or anything but when people say he got bossed by a league 1 defender it was because the ref let a lot go. Was at the game and was surprised how much pushing, pulling and going through the back of players was ignored. Wouldn't get away with it on a Sunday morning.
I think a Falcao can be very good for us he just needs time to play back into form after suffering a bad injury. Patience was always going to be required.

5424~~~
And yet Wilson thrived in the same circumstances, when usually he's the one who looks lightweight and not up to physical challenges

5425~~~
No he didn't.

5426~~~
Watching his attempt to reach Wilson's through ball was utterly painful. It was like he was running underwater.

5427~~~
Of course he did.

5428~~~
That was Wilson thriving today? Running around a lot and making a couple decent touches and putting a header over the bar?

5429~~~
Need to see the match again but I didn't see Wilson do much that I'd describe as thriving.

5430~~~
I'm not sure even Pele would do well with the service we provide our strikers.

5431~~~
I have no idea where the FFP story came from.
Officially, it is a loan deal, he can be returned to the owner (Monaco) and that's what counts.

Only 3 weeks ago, many fans were demanding that Falcao start. LvG stated he wasnt ready. I stated he was returning from injury so dont expect 80+ minutes from him, until early January.
Well, we are now in early January. He has only just returned to playing at full power. In a league he has never played before. In a country he has never lived in.

Dont expect miracles and dont judge the player after 3 starts. He'll need at least another 15 starts before any judgement can be cast on him.
And if he doesnt deliver, I assure you, FFP or no FFP, he will be returned to the seller.
Verbal agreements count for nothing when £44M is at stake.

Oh and if you think this guy needs to be returned, who should we buy in his place? Cavanni? Ibrahimovic?

5432~~~
It's been 10 months since his injury and to compare it to others I've read it takes around 12 months to get back to expected form. Walcott today played after 12 months so compare that to Falcao who was playing for Monoco in the summer is unreal! It's all about building him back up and it's a process that takes time.

Do you think UTD never knew that before the loan and also do you really think we should let him go after paying to get him back to his potential?

5433~~~
Heres me thinking he scored a decent little goal against Stoke!

5434~~~
Doesn't look close to being worth the amount talked about. He's looked like an average striker since he came here. 

Buy a younger striker instead.

5435~~~
We don't know how much he will cost as there are a few prices being reported. Ill agree he doesn't look like he was pre injury but I'm not sure his fully recovered his injury and still lacks a bit of courage.

5436~~~
From a business perspective, that would've been a terrible decision.
Would you have signed Theo Walcott in the Summer (who hadnt played any games for a few months due to the same injury)? No, of course, not.
You would wait and see how his injury pans out (just like we did with Vidal, who BTW looks like he is running in treacle, these days), before paying. Same with Strootman (LOL, we only want to buy injured players, it seems).
That's exactly what we have done here.
If E.Woodward has already signed the agreement to buy Falcao, he deserves to be shot - it would be a school boy error that even a grad student would not make.
Its a loan deal with first option to buy, at the end of the season.
If Monaco did not agree to this, we would have said "no", just like we did with Strootman and Vidal, in the Summer.

5437~~~
At this moment i would take a young, promising, pacey striker ahead of him on summer for sure. But i still believe with time and confidence he can be a beast player for us.

5438~~~
Lacazette. Or just play 4-3-3 or 4-4-1-1, buy wingers and erase the need of having 4 strikers.

5439~~~
Babysteps away from football nirvana. 

God knows what his reaction will be when he gets a dangerous shot in for the first time this season. Will he reach a redcafe pinaccle of arousement?

5440~~~
So instead we agreed to pay 250k a week for a player that was unfit and therefore couldn't fully assess whether he'd reach the heights pre injury? Might as well had bought Vidal cause this is no different really (tongue n cheek).  Like I believe, we would only invest this time and effort in a player that we have already bought otherwise we are paying 8m+ wages to rehab the player back to another club....I'm convinced he's already our player. The only thing to confirm is the fee.

5441~~~
I don't want it to seem as if I'm knocking Wilson. I'm really not in the habit of slating our own players. 

Just attempting to justify my claim that we seem to be on a trend of overplaying other attackers contributions and downplaying the admittedly few things Falcao has done for us. We seem to hold him to different standards right now and I don't think thats right. Some may disagree and that is their prerogative. 

I just think the upside to Falcao is phenomenal and if there's a chance he can get back there, we'd be fools not to give him every chance to do so.
Without trying to sound arrogant here, we should achieve our aim of top 4 this season, whether Falcao is a starter or not. So why not give him games, chances and support and hope he hits the heights he has previously. If he doesn't, cut our losses in the summer and look elsewhere.

5442~~~
Very much agreed.

5443~~~
Realsitcally there's about atleast 10 other strikers who you could buy for similar money that would be a lot more likely to do a better job. Still has time to prove me wrong but he looks a shadow of the outstanding player he was at Athletico.

5444~~~
Because it isn't as simple as that. His current level isn't good enough, and with van Persie being a managers favourite and Rooney being our captain, we're forced to play a ridiculously imbalanced side to fit him in.

5445~~~
He's truly Berbatov Mk II. I like him a lot and people are being too harsh on him(like how most were Harsh on the Berb)

5446~~~
It might not be a popular choice but Falcao's upside > RvP's upside for me. He should be starting ahead of RvP imo.

As for an imbalanced side, that's a problem LVG has brought on himself. Its his job to find a system that suits the personnel he has brought in.

5447~~~
I don't think it is. Berbatov was still a fantastic player, he just simply wasn't cut out for our style of football at the time. Falcao isn't at the same level he has shown before, and is still regaining match fitness and working his way back to his best. Maybe the level of criticism is similar but that's all, in my eyes.

5448~~~
Berbatov was a different animal - a proven PL striker who would've flourished in a more smooth, possession based team. But he was never quite bombastic enough for the 'cavalier', on the break football that Fergie was famous for.

Ironically, Berbatov would've probably been better under Van Gaal than he was under Fergie.

Falcao's arrival thus far has reminded me most of when Shevchenko signed for Chelsea. He has that same look of a formerly elite striker who just can't keep up with the speed and physicality of the English game. He's always just a second behind the play and is easily outpaced by even average defenders.

Maybe this will change, though at Falcao's age and increased physical fragility, I'm not entirely convinced it will - how much faster is he going to get than he is now? How much stronger?

You need to be physically game in the PL and you can't be behind the play even a split second, it's a league that will make you look shit if you're missing either of these.

Falcao might be better suited at this point of his career moving to Italy where the tempo of football is slightly more forgiving and less rugged.

He looks more like a squad player than a starter thus far, and if we are gonna sign him I think it should be for no more than £20m with squad striker wages, any higher than that and you're simply paying for reputation.

Just my opinion.

5449~~~
I wont judge him on todays performances as he didnt get a decent pass all day

5450~~~
Can you guys stop bringing up his age? He's 29, not 35. 

I'm far from convinced yet, but I don't get the level of scrutiny he receives from the caf. Don't forget that he has actually contributed vital goals and assists while recovering and settling down.

5451~~~
What was he doing today? I mean the service was bad but I thought he would be scoring bicycle kicks from inside his own half. It's Radamel Falcao after all. £44 million? A tenner and a pack of Walkers Prawn Cocktail and you have a deal.

5452~~~
This time last month it was Mata who was at the end of the over reactions we've got in this thread. Prior to that it was RVP, and earlier in the season people wanted De Gea gone.

There's too much knee jerk reactions to a players performance nowadays. Next time Falcao scores a couple of goals in a couple of games, he'll be back to being the best number 9 in the world.

5453~~~
Agreed. I'm not usually one to moan but the player threads are so knee jerk that they're tiring at the moment.

5454~~~
Who ever wanted De Gea gone is an idiot, though I don't think anybody said that. If anyone said stuff it was just that he started the season relatively quietly and not in the great form from last year.

The criticism for all the players was justified though. Van Persie was in really poor form and looked a shadow of his former self, and then he started playing a lot better, same with Mata. They just weren't getting on the ball at all and kind of went hiding in games. With Falcao though, I really want him to succeed here but I doubt that we'll sign him long term. Just seems to be having troubles adjusting to the physicality of the league, and while he does have glimpses of class and is obviously still recovering from his injury, I have my doubts if he'll ever get back even close to the high standard he was at before. It's like a 50/50 shot how he'll end up, because all his movements are just that bit off, which can be down to sharpness from being out injured, but also there's an equal chance of it just being the injuries taking their toll on him. We'll see which one it is I guess.

5455~~~
Not quite. At his best he'd be brilliant for us or any team, and this is just his injury maybe taking it's toll on him so we don't know what level he can get back to. Berbatov just wasn't ever cut out for a team like United mentally, or suited to our style of play.

5456~~~
I'm sure he'll score more important goals for us by the end of the season. It definitely isn't the return we'd been hoping for but as long as he contributes in getting us back in the top 4, I couldn't care less. He'll have played his part and we can spend the money elsewhere.

5457~~~
He played a major role in our league win you ungrateful prick.

5458~~~
He has become extremely unathletic. No pace, no agility and physically weak and unimposing. I think he's lost it really. Might still have the technique and knowledge of how to be a striker but he looks like he's completely lost the legs to perform his actions. It's a shame.

5459~~~
Sorry if I upset you I guess? He did have that one brilliant half season and scored 20 goals throughout the whole year, yes, and helped along with Nani carry us through the period when Rooney had the whole contract shit, but other then that he hardly did anything in his United career. Half a good season in 4 years.

5460~~~
He was anonymous, but I tend to think pretty much any striker of his ilk would've been anonymous today. Aside from a couple of posession losses, I can't really blame him for failing to convert non-existent chances, or get on the end of non-existent deliveries.

5461~~~
Im trying to think of any striker in the last 20 or 30 years who could create their own chances and put up top level numbers on a consistent basis. Henry is the only one really from the Premier League. I dont know what people expect from Falcao when he is getting absolutely no service from our makeshift midfield. The movement and instinct is still there, he just needs something other than balls fired into him from deep with his back to goal.

5462~~~
I've thought that he has added more to the team than RVP has in a lot of games. He holds off defenders and gets the ball very well, the majority of times winning a free or keeping the ball. My major fault with him is his total lack of pace. It basically rules out playing through balls to him. Ideally I feel he should be paired with a fast attacker (which is what LVG is attempting with Wilson) or not played. When RVP and Falcao both play we simply have no pace up front and it hurts us as we can't get in behind teams. All but rules out counter attacking football. Those two simply shouldn't play together in my opinion.

5463~~~
Rooney has been poor the last few games, is he shit now, too? Falcao was our best player vs Newcastle, and he's played in every game since then, scored against Stoke, all the while working his way up to fitness. Pretty much everybody was terrible today, except Mata, Herrera and ADM, when he came on.

Basically this is a terrible, terrible thread.

5464~~~
Big fan of him, and i desperately want him to succeed here, but he needs to show much more than he has thus far. Right now, he is riding on his reputation.

Still, RvP looked shite at the start of the season, but kept getting chances. I hope Falcao is given the same opportunity to prove himself

5465~~~
Yeah best to avoid it. It will be an interesting read if he hits form, wonder what all the 'he lost it' posters will say.

5466~~~
Even if he scored 30 goals I would consider his signing as a bad piece of business. No 29 year old striker is worth 40m especially if he's playing in the EPL were the pace and physicality of the game tend to cut the striker's career short. Things might be different if we had 2-3 twenty year old something strikers that would benefit from Falcao's experience. Unfortunately its not the case.

Id rather see us get a quality CM and move our best striker upfront. If we need a 3-4th striker get Hernandez back.

5467~~~
I really don’t see how Falcao can be fully judged considering the poor service he is getting, as good a striker as he potentially is there’s a limit to what can be created from scraps.

Against Stoke he did score & bring some tenacity and was missed when he was substituted, ironically the game against Yeovil would have suited him better when Di Maria came on and the game became stretched.

The main problem in this squad for me starts primarily with the shocking distribution coming out of defence.

5468~~~
How about almost every attack we had, he showed good holdup and linkup play. Pay more attention

5469~~~
I'd love to see him in a well working team, with a great midfield behind him that can actually create chances. Difficult for him (and any other striker) if there is no service but his general play I think is fine

5470~~~
Okay, will do from now on.

5471~~~
No doubt they will be hiding.

5472~~~
Is it only me that thinks he has a weird running style? Did he have this pre-injury?
He does look a little slow to me - even Yeovil defenders were bullying him yesterday. 
Do not want for £40m at the moment, but happy to reassess at the end of the season. If he hasn't got any stronger/faster then I think we should pass.

5473~~~
We should spend our money on some wingers not on strikers. 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 is the formation we should build our team around, RVP/Rooney/Wilson is more than enough if we play with a single striker. getting some players like Deepay or Reus should be our priority.

5474~~~
He always ran like that, nothing to do with injury, no worries haha.

5475~~~
This place is funny. Few weeks ago LVG was clueless for not playing him [while he was injured] - now, he's not good enough, past it and stuff [after one below average performance]. There's a reason we took him on loan, let's not forget that. If he comes good, we will sign him. If he doesn't, then we won't. And Falcao is 29 for heavens' sake, the way people go on about his age, you'll think he's nearing 35. If there was any other top, up and coming striker, I would have preferred that obviously, but the only other striker we can go for is Cavani and to be honest, I don't think he's particularly stellar.

5476~~~
I wouldn't worry too much about him, especially when our midfield is creating feck all for our strikers.

5477~~~
I'd rather have Falcao than Cavani...

5478~~~
Theres always an excuse for some people. Lack of service, not in the right position, formation was wrong. Why can some people just never call it as it is?

5479~~~
Our strikers do lack service though.

5480~~~
Wait another 2-3 months. He had a lengthy layoff, was rushed from it in order to be prepared for the World Cup in which he didn't participate anyway, then he had a few short spells on the sidelines while at United. He need a few weeks of proper football before we can assess whether he'll be up for it or not.

5481~~~
All of our Strikers haven't looked great this season, couldn't be anything to do with the team not creating enough for them though...
Anyway 7 starts 3 goals and 3 assists isn't exactly that bad for a player coming back from injury. Jury is still out, I wouldn't be inclinded to sign him at the end of the season as yet, but I'm open to seeing what he does from now till the end of the season if he can stay fit and Di Maria and Herrera can stay fit too.

5482~~~
Why? Falcao has always been reliant on service and we've been poor in that aspect for a while. He has still scored a few important goals for us this season and has basically won us 4 points with his goals versus Everton, Villa and Stoke. It's not like he's been Torres mk2 for us, he's been mostly decent and if we could pick him up for €25m at the end of season it'd be a great deal.

5483~~~
Because in the real world everything is not black and white.

5484~~~
Yep. When he's missing chances left right and centre a la Torres then we can make a judgement.

Until then I'll be keeping an open mind myself. We look pretty ugly all over the pitch to be fair.

5485~~~
He's clearly not in the Torres category, he's fine. He's just not in the category of player you should be paying lots of money for either

5486~~~
Pretty much.

If we <i>do</i> end up signing him (barring dramatic improvements in performance) it will just prove that the permanent deal was already pretty much done and dusted when he came, and just being delayed for FFP or whatever reason it was.

5487~~~
If we get a creative midfielder Falcao and RVP will again be seen as world class. They both are established top strikers for club and country and have not suddenly become crap. It is clear that the midfield we possess are not creative or adventurous enough for us to utilize them properly.
They must be extremely frustrated.

5488~~~
Watching him its pretty obvious hes not quite back when he stands up or is one on one with a defender. Old days it would be a quick setup over side step and look for the shooting opportunity. He had that chance vs Stoke I think it was and he seems to just not want to take the player on and tried to shoot through/round him.
Saying that though he is improving, his movement looks good and he is holding up the ball, taking players on (from deep) trying to move the game forward.

Anyway all part of the recovery process, lets see how he progresses but hes definately not looking like a 40m+ player right now. If we haven't already signed on the dotted line, I think that price tag needs to be renegotiated.

5489~~~
Actually in many respects he has, as a couple of people thought earlier in the thread. The lack of pace and strength, the way he never seems to be in the right place at the right time, which only now and then results in  a goal. Difference with Torres is he wasnt coming back from an injury I guess.

We used to sit there going on about his hold up play  and ability to assist as well early on before it dawned on us he actually used to be a world class goal scorer.

5490~~~
I just dont particularly like RVP and Falcao as a strike partnership. They are too similar and I have been saying that since day 1. Not many top teams play with two strikers nowadays, the benefits you get from having the extra midfielder are substantial. In my book, in order to facilitate having two strikers on the pitch, they need to be of a very high quality - which ours are - and offer versatility and a variety of options - which ours <i>dont.</i>

I dont dislike Falcao, I just think he was an unnecessary signing and that we would have had a more balanced and versatile squad if we had stuck with one of Welbeck or Hernandez for this season. Trying to fit Falcao, RVP, Mata, Rooney and ADM into a team is proving to be a challenge for LVG and understandably so, but it is a situation he created.

5491~~~
Herrera, Mata, Rooney....these guys are all pretty creative. Think its the style we are playing with rather than the players. 

Our only creativity is going wide and putting balls in, its terrible. Therefore Falcao and Rooney just feeding off scraps or perfect balls in (1 in 25). As you say we need creativity but I think we have the players to do it, its just our tactics or their choices are currently poor! Teams seem to find it easy to defend against us and I think thats just because we keep going wide. So they defend narrow wait for the pass out wide and then back themselves in either a bad cross or beating Falcao RVP in the air, which they should. 

LVG needs to mix things up here. 

Interesting one for me is Falcao hasnt dominated a game yet, he still may well be finding his feet (fitness for me prob not so much he's been back 2+ months now), like created chances out of nothing for himself, think of the other best players / strikers in the league. (Sanchez, Aguero, Hazard, Costa) these players have all dominated and bossed a few games this is what we need to see from RVP and Falcao turn a simple ball into their feet into a goal on a more regular basis. Di Maria has done this for us a couple of times early on this season.

5492~~~
You wont let it go, wont you? 
Ok you think he lost it but you never seem to tire of pointing that out.

If he hits form and goes back to his old days (if of course) I cant wait to hear from you first.

5493~~~
That goal against Stoke was a real striker's goal. He had the skill to react with fantastic technique to shunt the ball home. Doesn't look like a striker who has lost his sharpness to me. Quite the opposite......

5494~~~
This whole thread is  one long repetition anyway, so why not? If he comes good so be it, it will be nice to have a player of his calibre in the EPL. I will be first to acknowledge it.

5495~~~
Would you pay £44 million for him if you were the Chief Executive? Its not a case of whether he's got anything left in the tank. I reckon he probably does. Its about whether what he gives the team (or rather what our system gets out of him) if he's worth paying the huge figure in wages and fee that we'd need to bring him here full time. I dont see how you could justify it. Especially when there are far more pressing issues in our squad than up front. You could get Godin and Hummels for £50 million. And I certainly cant see us buying him on a perminant.

5496~~~
If he showed before the end of the season that signing him could be the difference between winning the CL or not then I would definitely consider it. At  the moment he hasn't had enough opportunity. Come March/April, we should have a much clearer idea about how this potential transfer might go.

5497~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

29 and a footballer is already too old. I know people like to see young players develop but it's gotten pretty ridiculous.

5498~~~
We will try to negotiate it down I think and will end up paying £20m for him if we end up signing him. I'd be baffled if we signed him for £44m but if we did it'd be a good will gesture towards Mendes a'la Bebe and we'd probably tie up De Gea to a long contract and sign a couple of his other clients in the meantime.

5499~~~
Its not that he's too old.

Its that he's too old for an extremely expensive transfer, which is why you rarely see a 29 year old bought for such a price and usually the fee is a lot less than you would pay for the player if he was 25 and in the best form of his career. Instead we're paying as much as he's ever been worth, maybe more for a player who isnt at his best, probably wont be and has a short time left at the top

5500~~~
You don't believe that at all (which isn't shocking for an oppo fan really), the whole Falcao stuff is turning into a real agenda for you. Well, it had quite a while ago, in truth.

5501~~~
He's not old but he's certainly not worth 40m+ especially since

a- he's a striker
b - we're already have enough experience upfront.

That money can be easily invested elsewhere ie where we need it most.

5502~~~
In today's market, Falcao would be worth more than the current valuation (still not even sure what it is given conflicting media reports) if he was 4 years younger. He would surely be worth as much as Di Maria.

Even besides that, I'll never know why people get so hung up on paying too much for players. People would actually turn down a 30 goal scoring forward that they can enjoy and cheer to in favour of seeing an extra £40 or so listed in a balance sheet. I find that odd.

5503~~~
Whilst I agree with the general sentiment, I think its quite obvious we really don't already have enough upfront and although tbh I'm not convinced (yet) Falcao is the guy.

5504~~~
Spending £40m on Falcao doesnt mean we won't have that money to spend elsewhere. We have the money to do both. Worrying about using funds frugally is a mid table club mentality, not United.

5505~~~
I just can't shake the feeling that he's now just alright...

5506~~~
Hammering Newcastle? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He got one assist! The ironic thing is you guys do him a massive disservice by going on  about one assist being a hammering, and being patronizing going on about a bit of hold up play here and there, yet he was one of if not the  deadliest players in the world. If anything I am the one who praises him because I can see how far he was fallen, injury or not.

Besides im not the sort of person who comes back after ONE  goal to say  how brilliant he is then  criticizes when he doesn't score, rinse and repeat.

In fact both the Villa and Stoke games that he scored in I thought he was poor, but then I am holding him to standards that he was my favourite striker from 2010-13.

5507~~~
I want to see him as a loan striker where the midfield is working.

I still think there is a 30 goal a season striker in there, I know I am in a minority and more on the optimistic side.

5508~~~
How? Di Maria makes things happen out of nothing and can play multiple roles, Falcao is a box striker who needs service. That type of player is nowhere near as valuable.

Ruud wouldnt cost you as much as Di Maria

5509~~~
I don't think that's the case. If he was the Falcao of old, without the serious baggage of his knee injuries, I reckon most people would be for it. As things stand the player you described might never come back. History isn't especially favourable towards strikers of his age with his injury record. Very few care about the balance sheet, I suspect, but rather what we could do with that £40m otherwise. For example, if it was an either/or I would have much preferred seeing a top midfielder bought last summer instead of Falcao, which would have allowed us to keep Welbeck and play Rooney in his actual position.

Of course, if our spending last summer is the new model then that's mostly moot and we'll all have to move with the times and get used to a wave of expensive mercenaries being parked here at the peak of their careers by whatever agent we're in hock to at the time. I can't say that's something I'm especially looking forward to.

5510~~~
We work with a budget and 40m+ would leave a dent in every club's finances. We've got other priorities in mind such as defense and midfield. If LVG is determined to add a striker then I hope he would be someone younger with more pace and who proves himself to be more prolific for us then Falcao.

5511~~~
It depends on the tactics we play to be honest. If we're determined to play with a one man striker system then we've got all the talent we need. Rooney is a fantastic  striker, RVP is showing early signs of decline but he could be prolific if used wisely, Mata is fantastic in the hole and Wilson is a great young talent. I seriously doubt that Real will buy Hernandez so he will probably return after the season is over.

5512~~~
I'd take him over RVP, honestly. He's looked better overall and he's not even settled properly yet

5513~~~
If Real Madrid wanted him in exchange for Benzema I wouldn't be opposed to that deal.

5514~~~
The thing is, we probably have to buy a striker in the summer anyway, RVP is going to be 32, Hernandez will likely move on, so we will only really have Rooney as a prime striker. Who else is a world class striker that will available? Aguero? No, Lewandowski? Nope, Suarez might be available if he doesn't score much but I doubt we will even consider buying him, which leaves Falcao the only reasonable option, unless we move for a young striker with potential.

As it stands, I'd buy him as a RVP replacement in the summer but that doesn't hide the fact he has been shocking in some games so far, he can't seem to run properly and hasn't adapted to the English game yet. Then again it's likely already a done deal and Falcao is probably already a United player but then we should be looking to move RVP on in the summer.

5515~~~
Cavani?

5516~~~
feck no! Benzema if anyone

5517~~~
He would have been perfect if Moyes was still here, but we don't really play towards a target man any more. He's only 1 year younger than Falcao and apparantly £50million has been quoted for him which is ridiculous. He also seems to have major attitude problems as he has missed training quite a few times now and has recently been fined for it.

5518~~~
Wouldn't we need to buy him 1st?! Would love Benzema but just can't see that one happening. I really hope we are scouting some other strikers at the moment. 

Here is a question, knowing what we know now - would you have Welbeck back over Falcao?

5519~~~
No.

Falcao has a 3 goals and 3 assists in 7 starts
Welbecck has 4 goals and 2 assists in 14 starts

Whilst Falcao has underwhelmned he has had mitigating circustances (injuries and not alot of playing time). I've watched Welbeck at Arsenal and he is the same player he hasn't really progressed at all.

I think its best he moved on, and I still would bet Falcao would probably double Welbecks goals by the end of the season.

EDIT: With Walcott coming back to fitness and Giroud back I wouldn't be suprised to see Welbeck warming the bench a few times at Arsenal

5520~~~
You never know, The club may say to Monaco that they want a re-structered deal if things stay as they are. At this point I can imagine there will be a few nervous faces at Monaco as their cash cow is starting to lose real value to them.

5521~~~
If we don't buy him, I can totally see City pulling another Tevez.

5522~~~
That would be very bad...

5523~~~
Not at all. Tevez was 24-25 and had many years ahead of him, Falcao would have 2 or 3

5524~~~
I'd normally agree but with Mendes pulling the strings he'll be parked somewhere next year, even if not with us.

5525~~~
Yes but if he got back to his best sort of form that would be him and Aguero up top, no thanks.

5526~~~
After 18 months it'd look like a waste of money and theres always the chance it doesn't go absolutely perfectly. In fact theres a much higher likelyhood of that

5527~~~
Is it predominately about a lack of form and confidence with him or more about a lack of  service? Either way can anyone be certain one of those is going to significantly improve from now until the end of the season?

5528~~~
His form and confidence are very likely to improve (hes only played 4 or so games since coming back from injury)
Service is likely to improve (our best creator hasn't been playing in said games (Di Maria))

5529~~~
The Falcao poll would've been interesting if there was a 4th option of renting him again for another year, in the Tevez mold. Save the fee of buying him but get the benefit of having him for a final year before he begins to fade.

5530~~~
Based on what we've seen so far, a buy for Falcao would be ill-advised.  But it's only January and he's got roughly 2 months to prove he's worth the buy.

5531~~~
This x100. Bony is absolute class and thoroughly at home in the league. Can lead the line on his own but not seen much of him in a front two though. 
I'm guessing many of the elite clubs, and Liverpool, will be after him.

5532~~~
The way I see it is, having him for a year is a pretty decent deal in itself. He either flops out and you don't spend £45m or he bangs in the goals as you'd expect and maybe you have a short-term top class striker to bridge the gap between van Persie aging and completely fading away to the next big thing.

If we had spent £45m+ on him on deadline day it would've been a seriously bad deal, but as it stand we haven't lost out THAT much. His signing wasn't really to the detriment of anyone else. You could argue Wilson loses out, but he's started his fair share of games and has struggled to make a difference so far, regardless of Falcao's presence (bearing in mind he's spent half of his time here injured).

I think if he can score 10 goals in the second half of the season and continue to improve our pressing game from the front, he'll win over the majority. I can't think of too many obvious alternatives either, given that when we bring in strikers, they usually tend to have a pretty decent reputation.

He's had a mixed bag of a start at United. He looked genuinely good and mobile in the opening weeks of the move, but wasn't really getting many chances. Now he looks a bit slow and lethargic, and tends to either get very few chances, or snatch at them. There is definitely an issue of balance in the team at the moment and I think it means at least one of van Persie, Falcao or Mata surely having to be left out at any given time to make the team click a bit more.

5533~~~
It's clear we have agreed a fee and wages but I don't think for one second we would have signed him permanently given his injury, I think we just took a gamble and will decide what to do at the end of the season. I genuinely feel he won't ever get back to the level he was at and even if he improves this season I would question the wisdom of signing another slow attacking player. If we do it should only be another year on loan of for a cut price fee.

I also think we should be looking longer term, falcao has 1-3 good years in him, we should be looking for a more up and coming player. I do have sympathy for him though playing alongside RVP, no width, too many long balls etc, even at his peak he would have found it tough.

5534~~~
He really is so painfully slow. I know he was never the fastest, but he looks like he's running in treacle.

He's nowhere near worth £45 million. Not even close. We'd be idiots to pay it.

5535~~~
If we buy from a lower club, someone like Berahino or preferably Benteke should be the target. Bony clearly won't fit our needs if we are looking for pace up front.

5536~~~
Just give him until April/May and then you guys can decide (not that it matters) whether you want to send him back to Monaco.

5537~~~
The Mendes thing is what makes me think we may well end up signing Falcao even if he continues to look a spent force. The club isn't going to want to piss off someone so influential to so many top players' careers.

5538~~~
I have to admit I've grown a bit cold towards spending a fortune on keeping Falcao, unless he really comes up with the goods in the second half of the season. I'd still love to see him succeed here though - the handsome bastard is already one of my favorite players!

5539~~~
I dont really rate bony, whenever I watch him he seems very lazy and moves like a tree also he seems a little clumsy on the ball, he loses possession quite a lot. He's more of a battering ram striker. If we want a striker in that mould then I would much prefer benteke he is basically bony but better in everyway

5540~~~
He's got a lot better with his holdup and linkup play this season. The ball doesnt bounce back off him so much and he's capable of playing a good pass to help the attack. It would be better than Falcao's anyway

5541~~~
Fantastic pieces of Falcao skills... <a class="externalLink" href="http://beautifullyred.co.uk/2015/01/05/stunning-falcao-skills-and-more-united-gifs-from-the-yeovil-win/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://beautifullyred.co.uk/2015/01...lls-and-more-united-gifs-from-the-yeovil-win/</a>

5542~~~
Needs a run of games to get more comfortable with the team and get the sloppiness out of his game, but now with Di Maria back, I think he will be dropped.

5543~~~
Like some people have mentioned before i do think Falcao is a done deal, when we signed him it was reported as such by some, LVG has defended him a lot and seems to like him, it has been reported it wasn't just a last minute buy the deal was negotiated over a number of weeks. Also looking at the things Falcao says it doesn't sound like somebody who just wants to stay short term, i know people will say all footballers claim to love the club, but looking at the effort he is putting in on the pitch and the passion he shows he does look like a player who's not just here for a season, he's playing like he has a point to prove. I guess we will find out at the end of the season, but it has been reported that the fee has been lowered to 31m, which must be something to do with him willing to lower his wage.

5544~~~
He's a very good striker no doubt and I'm confident he will get back to full fitness. Once we play well as a team, he will score plenty of goals, just look at his runs and positions in the box. I dont see why so many are concerned in case we buy him, even if it's for 40m

5545~~~
I’m concerned because he will be 29 this summer, had a terrible injury last year, and except making good runs he scored 3 goals in 7 starts and 5 from the bench earning 280K/w. I’m concerned yes also because our current style doesn’t suits us, we don’t create much opportunities, we play deep on the pitch with low penetration. So unless we come back to a common 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 with him competing with RVP for the top spot, I don’t think that 57M€ is a good opportunity for him, regarding what he’s doing.

I hope I will be wrong, but we need immediate effect for such players, things that he’s not doing yet.

5546~~~
You could look at that another way though and say he's working so hard because he's desperately trying to show that United should sign him up to a long-term deal. So far Falcao this season has been actually been very similar to Tevéz in his second season (the second year of his two year loan) - working very hard, doing an awful lot of donkey work, scoring a few important goals but consistently failing to prove his worth and not trusted fully by the manager. If we have the option to not sign him up long-term I think (and hope) we take it because not taking on Tevéz was the right decision too.

5547~~~
I don't think we should sign him. Not for £40m, if we get it to half then yeah.

I just feel we need two type of strikers. One someone who is pretty physical and athletic like Costa, Mandzukic, Lewandowski and others that I forgotten to mention. Would take Cavani too ahead of Falcao. 

The amount of crosses we put in the box to midgets is stupid. A physical threat upfront would add something in the box and give defenders something to think about. 

Or we sign a striker with a lot of pace, who gives us a outlet to run in behind.

So depends on how we going to play. Sadly Falcao is none of the above. He's not a physical threat neither is he quick. I don't think he has it to be a successful poacher in the premier league. You take two of our recent poachers. RVN was a physical presence, when the ball was in the box he won that header. Then you got Hernandez, who was lightning quick.

Then we come to the case of Owen. Who once lost his pace was never the same player and I feel the same is happening with Falcao. There's a clip of Falcao scoring a brilliant goal from his own half against Barca at the camp nou. I feel that Falcao has gone sadly. He wasn't the quickest, but when he got that yard of pace on you then defenders weren't catching him. He's lost that pace.

5548~~~
Tevez left because we kept playing Berbatov instead despite him under performing for us at the time, i guess Fergie felt obliged to play him because he wasted 30m (lot of money at the time) on him. Tevez was a better player and goal scorer than Berbabtov and proved that at City and Juventus, ofcourse we could have never known he would join city at the time and turn into an utter kn*b. He was a very good player for us in 08 and an important part of the CL/PL winning side then the next season he gets benched, can understand why he left. Falcao will actually get a chance and get a lot of game time so it is a different situation imo.

5549~~~
Do we need a WC striker though. Rooney is a proven striker, RVP is showing signs of decline but can be a great asset if used adequately and Wilson has great talent. We can easily get away with it with a younger striker with good finishing skills

5550~~~
Good point, is Falcao even a world class striker anymore? Should we also be signing another player who will probably need replacing in a couple of years? More I think about it the more I am put off signing him not just because of the fee but because I don’t think we need another slow striker who is (probably) past his best. 

Personally I don’t think he will ever be the world class player he once was, how far short he will be I am not sure but I would prefer to sign a younger player who can add something different like Dybala for example or even Bony or Benteke given how we play currently. It’s a gamble but so is signing Falcao and he is running out of time to prove otherwise. This transitional period should be about rebuilding not throwing money at players whose reputations outweigh their current ability.

5551~~~
We all like him, want him to success and pray he hits his goal scoring form but.. worst case scenario, it was a genius gamble to get him on loan and one thus far has not worked out.

5552~~~
Replace genius with expensive

5553~~~
Signing Falcao is hardly genius to be fair.

Risky and expensive, yes. But genius no

5554~~~
Taking into account he was probably going to City before we stepped in and we all thought at the time we were getting the best no.9 in the world (pre injury) it was a brilliant move because if it had worked out we'd be laughing at the deal now.

5555~~~
A ton of negativity surrounding Falcao. I don't fully understand it, because if we're creating chances, which he is missing, fair enough.

But I'm willing to give him a while longer before I decide to write him off.

5556~~~
And it hasnt. It cost £6 million for a season and making our backup striker want to leave

The only way "genius" should even be a thought is if he came in and scored 30 goals, which he clearly hasnt and wasnt likely to

Also, if he had gone to City then thats Jovetic and Dzeko off just like it was Welbeck and Hernandez off for us. That would have been a result

5557~~~
Welbeck had already left before we got Falcao, so I don't see how you can say he caused Welbeck to leave us. Van Gaal told him he was not in his plans, and well, Welbeck has not been all that at Arsenal despite his performances in the champions league. Falcao is on the verge of hitting form at the moment imo.

5558~~~
Our strikers are very skillful when the ball is played to their feet. Through passes, one-twos and dummies around the box is what they excel in, however, we rely on crosses too much. Falcao at one time was considered one of the top 3 strikers in the world (2012). I think instead of trying to get rid of them we should modify our midfield so as to get the most out of Falcao and RVP.

5559~~~
Falcao has good aerial ability, much better than RVP's so I see no reason why crossing it to him is detrimental.

5560~~~
<i>Much</i> better? We're talking about the same Robin van Persie here, right?

5561~~~
Because Jovetic and Dzeko want to play just like Welbeck and Hernandez. If Falcao comes into your club on a £6 million loan deal with a huge fee agreed to buy him, they will want to be elsewhere just the same

5562~~~
Yes he is excellent in the air but that does not mean that nearly every attacking ball should come via a cross especially against teams with big defenders like stoke. No team in the world has better central strikers than us. PSG have Zlatan and Cavani but both RVP and Falcao are better than Cavani. Our play should be centered around providing service to our great strikers.

5563~~~
If he misses bucket loads of chances I would agree but I don't feel we have really given any of our strikers proper support yet. Apart from maybe the Tottenham game where he looked leggy he has looked sharp and has taken most of his shots nicely. 

I personally think it's worth seeing how he goes into the end of the season before deciding, I have a feeling the longer he stays the better the will get.

5564~~~
I was at the Tottenham match, and it felt like RVP and Falcao were the same player. Nevertheless, I think it's a combination of many factors why it's not gone smoothly for him so far.

While he hasn't been great, few people have looked good in this garbage 3-5-2.

5565~~~
This is an article written by Scott Patterson for ESPNFC. Basically he's comparing Falcao's time at the club with that of Tevez. I can see the similarities between the two situations, but the article fails to take into account a number of variables that separate them.


<span style="color: #000000"><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.com/club/manchester-united/360/blog/post/2231477/premier-league-radamel-falcaos-man-united-stint-will-remind-some-of-carlos-tevezs-time-at-the-club" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">[LINK] Falcao's time at Man United is similar to Carlos Tevez's stint with the club.</a></span>

5566~~~
It's just too early to judge. If he remains injury free and gets a run in the side I think he'll prosper but with his signing fee and wages it"s up to him to prove he's the prolific striker he's shown in the past. I trust the club to make the correct decision come end of season.

5567~~~
We need to provide him with a midfield that can give him (and RVP) chances. Only then can we really judge where he's at.

If he's getting loads of chances and still not putting them away then it settles it but for now our strikers are feeding off very small scraps indeed.

5568~~~
Agree we need a midfeild who can supply him good balls but also to take into consideration is that he also needs a striker along side him who makes run and opens up space for him.

It's a tough one as what I see in him is what his done at other clubs and I keep thinking to myself that he will repeat that here, but it might not happen and that's hard to get my head round unless we sign Ronaldo<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

5569~~~
I think the deal is already done, wouldn't make any sense for us to spend a whole year helping him recover from the injury to then pass him on to another team so they can reap the benefits.

5570~~~

5571~~~
Hope I'm wrong, but it reminds me how I felt during the early days of Veron playing for us: I like him as a player, I really really want him to succeed...but I have this nagging doubt that he isn't going to hit the heights at United.

5572~~~
For me, he's the most underwhelming of the summer signings. I don't understand the adulation he recieves from the crowd, as he's done very little during his time here so far.

5573~~~
I think it's the combination of his previous achievements and a cool chant which have made him a bit of a cult hero!

5574~~~
I was watching his highlights of the game vs Spurs earlier, and I his overall play (outside the box) was actually pretty good. Good touches (in between some admitted shockers) good strength and hold up play, and pretty good linking up with others. However, in the box he was awful. Missed two really good chances, and was terrible to react to Mata's free kick off the post. 

And the weird thing is, that display kind of summed up his performances for me so far for United. He came here with this reputation of being the most lethal finisher in the game, that only needs one chance to score, will score from pretty much any angle, but wont offer much outside the box. Yet, his work in the box, for the most part, has been awful. I see people moaning about lack of service and whatnot, but he's had plenty of chances, and missed a lot. He's been snatching a lot at chances, and showing very little composure. Yet his game outside the box has been pretty impressive.

All of which makes me wonder, was his reputation a bit exaggerated? I've seen a couple of posts (one around the time he signed) that showed that his goalscoring record, without the penalties, although good, isn't actually <i>that </i>special. At least not as good as his reputation and standing in the game would lead you to believe.

I know a lot of people think I hate the lad, but I really don't. I'm desperate for him to succeed, and love his work rate and desire. But he's become a real conundrum, and a bit of a mind feck to think about. He's seemingly good at the things I expected him to be bad at, and rubbish at the things that he's supposed to be brilliant at.

5575~~~
He's Radamel Falcao for f*cks sake.

5576~~~
This.

He's not getting any bloody service, with Angel back and Herrera in midfield he's going to shine, I have no doubt. He's getting fitter with every minute played.

5577~~~
I think with Vidic it was around 9 months back to first team action and then a further 6 months in and out of form and fitness (fking ACL) <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
Falcao should be just about nearing total fitness and to be fair he's looked sharp, the finishing is still being snatched at here and there, but that will come as the muscle memory returns, repetition is the only way.
Hoping for a good second half of the season from him and yes, now our best attacking midfield is fit we should get a good picture of where he's at.

5578~~~
See, a few people have been saying this, but I think thats a cop out. In fact, I think its utter nonsense.

Off the top of my head, in the limited games he's played, he's missed a pretty good rebound chance vs QPR on his debut, horribly miss hit two chances against Everton (one outside the area which would have been very difficult to score, but he still snatched at it horribly, and the other from a Shaw cut back into the 6 yard box, against that he snatched at and miss hit). Missed three very good chances against Spurs (snatching horribly at one great through ball from Mata, falling over on the turn from a Rooney pass, and tamely shooting at Lloris when one on one with a defender). Ashley Young has also put in some absolute peaches over the past few weeks (the type of delivery Di Maria was putting in earlier, which everyone was claiming Falcao would score tons from) yet so far he's managed to convert one of those crosses, either completely missing, or making little contact, with the rest.

Look, I'm not saying we've been creating chance after chance, or that he's been missing chance after chance. But I'd argue that a top striker shouldn't need to be spoon fed all his goals, and that a Falcao of a few years ago would have quite probably scored most, if not all, those chances I mentioned above. Now, I accept that in quite a few of his cameos its been 10/15 minutes where the game has been dead, and therefore he's not got any chances. But he has had chances to score in other games, and has missed, quite badly in some cases. And thats why this excuse of no service bugs me. The service hasn't been great, but he's still had, and missed, chances.

5579~~~
Well to be fair that's pretty much what you have just said <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's recovering from the games most dreadful injury and the service hasn't been excellent, he's desperate to score his way into form which does explain why he's snatching and scuffing shots but when you've had ACL reconstruction the muscle memory is all but lost. The tissue around the operated area is actually new tissue and only time and repetition will get him back to anything like the Falcao we have all seen. 
Personally I think he is worth the wait and for me he gets time, as much as he requires, within reason of course.

5580~~~
No I haven't. I've named 6 specific chances (one very much a half chance) that I expect a player of his ilk to better with. I've not said that he's been missing 3 chances every game (which he obviously hasn't).

5581~~~
We've not created him 3 a game yet <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> 
Like I've already stated, he's going to need time to get back on top of his game and he's also going to need good service. 
Hopefully the returns to fitness of Herrera and Di Maria mark a change in that, he's not had consistent game time in front of either.

5582~~~
If he's going to be so much reliant on service, what's the point of keeping him over Chicha? Wasn't this the same problem we had with Chicharito? Do people on here think Falcao has been / will be significantly better than him in terms of their all-round games rather than just the goals and chances created? Gotta admit, I haven't seen enough of Falcao's all-round game prior to Man Utd, so it's an honest question.

5583~~~
Chicharito wanted to leave (also Welbeck too) so another striker was needed but not sure Falcao should have been the answer.

5584~~~
£6m loan punt on a World Class striker coming back from injury with a first option to buy when we still have Rooney, Van Persie and Wilson? 

We'd have been crazy to turn that down.

5585~~~
This so much.

5586~~~
I'm sure Chelsea said the same thing about Andriy Shevchenko, or even Torres. Thankfully we only loaned him so we shouldn't waste £40 million if he doesn't start putting in top quality performances regularly.

5587~~~
The only reason I'd not sign him is because Rooney has been extremely inconsistent in midfield.

5588~~~
If it is just a loan then yeah it was a great decision but if like it's also been said, it's a loan anticipating the buy then it's a bad move.

5589~~~
It's just my opinion, I wouldn't have a clue what the details of the deal are but I would put my money on a trigger making the move permanent if we make top 4 and the loan finishing if we don't.

If we do make the Champions League, Falcao would be a massive 'addition' to the squad.

5590~~~
I'm going to reserve judgement on him until we get the more creative players back behind him. The likes of Herrera and Di Maria Nd an extra man in midfield rather than defence. They're feeding off scraps with no space to play in.

5591~~~
I would love nothing more to be completely wrong about him and to be even laughed at.

5592~~~
Fit or not his touch is worse than Rooney and is taking up Rooney's best position. 

I do believe he is better than this but it's frustrating watching a player come back to fitness when we are trying to get top 4 and move on from the darkest year the club has seen in 30 plus years. 

Sometimes I was Chicharito stayed despite being horrendous outside the box. He has pace which we lack desperately.

Saying all that Falcao can easily go on a crazy run of goals. Let's hope that happens.

5593~~~
Reminds me of all the "he's Mesut f-wording Ozil" comments from Arsenal fans last season.

From fans who thought Eriksen would flop in the Premier League.

5594~~~
Full agree with this. His finishing hasn't been upto the mark.

5595~~~
He is all about goals, not got a great touch or particularly great all round and has lost some pace and mobility.To get the best out of him he needs to play up front on his own with Rooney or Mata behind him and we need to play with more width to get crosses in. He was never really fast but he was quick enough and he has slowed down dramatically, he is never going to out pace anyone and he is only going to score a lot of goals from crosses (he is brilliant in the air) or through balls where his movement can compensate for the fact he can’t run.

Playing as we are now he is going to struggle to make much of an impact whether he is fit or not but that means ditching 3-5-2 and dropping RVP neither of which look likely at the moment. I assume the club will make the right choice about whether to sign him or not, if he improves considerably then we should think about buying him if not then he can go back to Monaco. Whoever buys him in the summer is taking on a big risk no matter how he performs a 29 year old for a big fee, big wages, a player who hasn’t been world class since 2012-13 and has had few serious injuries. The upside is of course that even if he only gets back to 90% of player he was he is one of best number 9’s around, personally I can’t see many teams being willing to shell out much more than £20m on him though.

5596~~~
I don't think he's quite the player he used to be.

5597~~~
It would make more sense for us to have signed him on loan with a first preference option to buy in case he finds top form and fitness, than to outright buy a recovering 28 year old for big money. At least that's what I hope happened.

5598~~~
Problem is if you don't now sign him, you're left with a 32 year old Van Persie and Wilson as the only outright strikers. Which means you desperately need to spend big money on a striker (if it isn't Benzema or Cavani, will probably make Bony look like a masterstroke).

5599~~~
I think Rooney would do great right uptop. His finishing is class these days. And Rvp should have plenty left in the tank too. We've also got other players like Mata who can play in the hole or as second strikers.

5600~~~
Really - maybe for the Rooney thread? But you think Rooney has been inconsistent in CM?

5601~~~
Hopefully having Di Maria back will make a difference to Falcao. He needs service. Him and RVP have been feeding from scraps most of the season.

5602~~~
Average goals a season had they played 38 games.

<span style="font-size: 9px">2011-13
Van Persie 28, Rooney 24, Mata 10, Di Maria 8 
Total 70

2013-15
Rooney 21, Van Persie 20, Mata 9, Di Maria 6
Total 56</span>

You're relying on your strikers to make up for the limitations in midfield and defence. But the strikers aren't the players they were a couple of seasons ago. Barely scraping 20 a season if you played every game, makes 80 goals a season very difficult, let alone the 100 Man City got last season.

5603~~~
Your logic is really flawed there, in that you're assuming strikes score goals independent of the service they receive. 

I can tell you for a fact that we our wingers and central midfielders were in much better form in 2011-13, then they have been since. Plus the whole 2013-15 stats is based almost entirely on an absolute disaster of a season in the immediate aftermath of Fergie's retirement. Not to mention that Rooney's been played in mifield far more in these last two seasons than he did in 2011-13. Things seem to be turning around now but let's wait until the end of the season before making assessing whether or not our attacking players are in some kind of terminal decline

5604~~~
This.

5605~~~
I think his situation could also hinge on de Gea.. Mendes is the agent of both, and if I were him I'd tell Woodward to sign up Falcao in order to keep de Gea. Pure speculation of course.

5606~~~
You're overestimating the power Mendes has. It's not like De Gea's contract runs out in the summer and he hasn't shown any signs of unhappiness. He won't be able to use him as a bargaining chip.

5607~~~
I'm not so sure of that, he is by all accounts the most powerful man in football these days. Remember how much influence he had at Real when Mourinho was there. Although, I agree that it is a stretch what I suggested there.

5608~~~
Still, I assume it would hinge on whether De Gea wants to leave or not not. He can't make demands using him if he refuses to sign for someone else. 
I think it's BS that agents even play a part in decision making when in most cases they only care about themselves.

5609~~~
Also, Mendes doesn't want bad relationships with one of the richest clubs, especially with FFP now.

5610~~~
That too. He'll probably have other clients in the future that could move to the club in big money deals, no point stirring the pot.

5611~~~
This! With Mourinho gone and Ronaldo on the decline in 1-3 years or whatever his power with RM has already been and will be further weakened. Therefore he can't afford to make us too angry.

5612~~~
Red, white and blue. Falcao is the only #mufc player who has scored competitive goals in all three kits this season.
<iframe allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" height="710" scrolling="no" src="//instagram.com/p/xqqNfNIHsb/embed/" width="612"></iframe>

5613~~~
He's lucky we don't have a fourth kit then.

5614~~~
Why do people talk as if Agents simply control players like puppets? Its the same in De Gea's thread.

5615~~~
I suspect its because the agents are the ones who directly engage in contract talks, and because their fee is often determined by big transfers or contracts.  If a client isn't the type who is inclined to sit-in on contract talks, or perhaps isn't the brightest spark, you can imagine that it'd be pretty easy for an agent to misrepresent things or otherwise mislead their client in a way that would benefit the agent personally.

In reality, some players will trust their agents more than others and some players will wish to be more directly involved in things like transfers and contract talks than others. It'll certainly be a spectrum but the potential for abuse of trust is there.

5616~~~
Ofcourse there is an element of control. What I'm saying is that if a De Gea or a Falcao want something, they will get it, they arent kids. Agents are there to get them the best possible deal. But if you go by these 2 threads, its as if Mendes will decide their future. If he acts the cnut, there is nothing to stop either party from just ditching him and negotiating the deal themselves and Mendes knows that too. So if De Gea wants to stay, Mendes will simply look to get him the best possible contract. He cannot force De Gea to leave just because we might not sign his other client Falcao.

5617~~~
As that's the case shame we don't play in a different colour every week.

5618~~~
Would like to see him dropped tomorrow with Di Maria coming into the side, if RVP doesn't perform then bring him on but I think we are a better team with only one of those two playing and at the moment I think RVP is the better of the two.

5619~~~
I'd really love to see Falcao partner Wayne up top, with say, Mata operating behind them. Falcao seems to occupy similar positions to that of van Persie, so when they play together, they don't seem to click as well. Rooney and Falcao would be a different partnership and in my opinion could work really well. Rooney with his high work rate as well as some (limited) creativity, along with Falcao's intelligent movement and clinical finishing could provide some really entertaining play in the final third.

I just feel that when he is playing with Robin, they seem to cancel eachother out a little bit, making the same runs and not really connecting well enough. I'd even go as far as saying that sometimes it feels that we're playing with 10 men. So for that reason I hope they're given a chance at that partnership.

5620~~~
Not even on the bench. I though he will be more effective than RvP today.
He is not even on the bench, injury?<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5621~~~
Shame he isn't starting. My only issue with the starting line up.

5622~~~
Injured again? Can't believe Wilson would make it for the 18 ahead of him.

5623~~~
He's injured most likely.

Another injury we picked up a day before a game. Ridiculous.

5624~~~
It can't be an injury again. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

If it is an injury and there's still any anyone that wants us to spunk £35million + to buy him can I have some of what you're on please....

5625~~~
Is there confirmation of this or are you inventing things ?

5626~~~
Likely giving him a rest. He did his ACL less than a year ago, has played a lot of minutes over Xmas. Seems most likely reason. Especially as we can afford, with the return of others.

5627~~~
Probably being rested. Though if it was just a rest you would assume he would be on the bench still. If it is an injury then that would just be beyond frustrating.

5628~~~
He's not injured. LVG's not stupid, he knows we needed the extra CM today.

RVP isn't getting dropped under him. Get used to it.

5629~~~
Why would he? He's our most reliable striker, oh and he didn't play last week.

5630~~~
This is pointless. Falcao class act but not worth the money with so much fitness issues to keep check.

So much time and effort has gone in getting him back but he simply doesn't fit the team, and English football is the worst for a player trying to recover to get into. He's looked without intensity when he has played and honestly, send him back. What's the point of having extra baggage to look out for? Work with what is ours.

5631~~~
If he was fit they could both be on the bench, we've got 3 Centre - backs on there!

5632~~~
I can understand dropping him from the starting eleven, I would've done the same to accommodate di Maria. But to not make the squad is strange, if he's not injured. And if he is injured, he's a crock. I don't think we should sign him, but I think we might.

5633~~~
That's true as well. Something is pretty wrong then, shame.

5634~~~
What else could be the reason?

I refuse to believe he's not on the bench unless he's injured. You don't leave a guy who can get you a goal out of nothing out the squad. Even when he wasn't fully fit a few weeks ago he was getting on the bench. And the last game we played was a week ago, which he was subbed off for too.

5635~~~

5636~~~

5637~~~

5638~~~
Well in this case it's going to be a long day in the 'LVG's substitutions' thread.

5639~~~
LVG denying an injury. Simply says he's not been selected.

5640~~~
He could be rested. He was wrecked over the Christmas games.

5641~~~
Really don't get that. If we need a goal off the bench then he would have been perfect and we haven't played for a week.

5642~~~
Wilson has done nothing to justify getting picked ahead of Falcao. Very strange.

5643~~~
ya not injured. glad about that. a little confused though

5644~~~
Wow.

If he can't get in when we have 3 Cbs on the bench then Van Gaal can't be too impressed with Falcao.

I mean he was proper shite against Yeovil but so were a lot of others.

5645~~~
Must be doing really well in training, that's the only explanation. A lot of our senior players said they were impressed with him in interviews.

5646~~~
He doesnt have to. The fact is Wilson has speed and can run past players with it and LVG will want that option as we have few players of that type

5647~~~
Probably just been rested, played a lot over the festive period

5648~~~
This!

Wilson has done absolutely nothing to warrant getting picked ahead of him. 

Very strange

5649~~~
He was due a rest. 

Villa (20th) Newcastle (26th) Spurs (28th) Stoke (1st) & Yeovil (4th)

He featured in all of those games.

5650~~~
He has the best song and all, but he's been pretty disappointing. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5651~~~
that is incredible if true, bearing in mind that he's scored..erm...3 goals total!

5652~~~
LvG has been a bit hypocritical when it comes to Falcao IMO. He was willing to play RvP through any shit to get him on form, and to be honest his form is nothing special at the moment.

5653~~~
van Gaal clesrly ain't impressed. He had a busy Christmas period but there's no harm in sticking him on the bench to bring on if we are desperate.

5654~~~
This! Wilson has done absolutely nothing to justify getting picked ahead of Falcao.

Can't help but think this is very strange.

5655~~~
Yes he might have featured in a bunch of games quickly stacked together, but he didn't play 90 in them all.
And he's barely played in this opening 6month period!

So to have Evans, Blackett and McNair on the bench over him is super odd

5656~~~
LVG said that Van Persie would have been dropped if it wasn't for injuries to the rest of the forwards.

5657~~~
I would be very surprised if we sign him full time. I'd honestly rather have kept Welbeck than Falcao, at least we wouldn't have to resort to Wilson to inject a little pace.

5658~~~
Of course it's a bit strange.

But he has started the last 5 matches. All should a bit calm down.

5659~~~
Very weird, doesn't bode well for him at all, I mean 3 CB's on the bench is weird and a kid striker who hasn't scored a goal all season.

5660~~~
Out of the whole squad though? Wilson has shown far less than Falcao.

5661~~~
Don't forget about Hernandez too, He would have been ideal for us in to bring on in a number of matches this year so far as would welbeck. In the scrappy games where we needed a goal like against spurs, villa and stoke recently. 

We'll probably get tons of hate for that but honestly I'd would've preferred us to keep welbz and/or Hernandez over bringing Falcao in.

5662~~~
I don't understand the "resting" argument. Resting him for what exactly? Today's a difficult game and if LVG thought he was a bit tired we could have used him as an option from the bench.

5663~~~
Wilson is nothing like Falcao though he offers pace upfront which we have been missing all season. He is also a young up and coming player from our own academy and that should count for something.

5664~~~
yes, but he didn't play 90 in them all, and why pick the game that he's had a full week in between since the last one to now suddenly rest him?!

5665~~~
Unlucky not to be a sub but right to drop him just isn't good enough at the moment and it looks increasingly unlikely he will be here next season so maybe LVG is showing faith in Wilson and thinking long term. Maybe falcao is just being rested but he has been subbed of in the recent games and has had a weeks rest so it seems unnecessary to leave him out for that reason.

5666~~~
He's obviously injured, LVG is telling porkies. There's absolutely no reason he shouldn't be on the bench to give us 20 mins at the end if needs be. Having no attacking threat on the bench isn't really how you should be going into a match. I'm sure LVG knows this so I reckon he's definitely injured but they want to keep it quiet for obvious reasons.

5667~~~
A bust-up, perhaps?

5668~~~
Don't get me wrong, I'm all for giving Wilson chances. However, in a tight game where we need a goal, I'd prefer to have Falcao off the bench.

I honestly don't see us signing him permanently which is not necessarily a bad thing.

5669~~~
Wilson looks like a headless chicken, which as a watcher or U21 football, I know he's not. He's simply not ready for the first team yet. Falcao should be on the bench, at least.

5670~~~

5671~~~
Falcao comes across as the type of guy difficult to have a bust up with, if that makes sense <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5672~~~
I'd rather we kept hernandez!

5673~~~
Di Maria and Januzaj could also do that. Wilson has been given several chances now and contributed nothing. I'm a big fan of his but you have to draw the line somewhere. Januzaj was only given a few chances and has hardly played since. Wilson has done no better than him yet is still being given chances. Falcao has got three goals and assists. Wilson nothing.

5674~~~
He started every game during the Christmas period. Don't see why we can't give him a rest when we have so many other attacking options.

5675~~~
It is a bit odd if he's just been rested from the squad entirely, but he's not really been all that great in the run of games he has started. Yes, other players have also been poor but they're proven in this side and in this league. Plus they're our players, whereas he isn't, so there isn't the same incentive to play him into form, possibly at the expense of the team.

5676~~~
It's alright to give him a rest. But its weird that he isn't on the bench atleast.

We are playing a good team today. Not relegation fodder.

5677~~~
Di Maria yes. Although he's not completely convincing as a striker. Januzaj obviously not

5678~~~
Someone on twitter has said that Falcao's bird is due to drop a sprog anytime soon.......

5679~~~
Would like to see him as our focal point but to be fair RVP scored 2 against Southampton last game we played them. Strange he is not on the bench don't understand that unless somethings up and that could be anything.

5680~~~
The reason of his exclusion is unacceptable.

5681~~~
Terrible from Falcao, ruining all the eletrifying stuff we would have played without him in the first eleven.

5682~~~
Is he injured or simply not RVP?

5683~~~
He's literally done nothing with that speed though, I cant think of a single run that's opened up an opposition defence while using Wilson's speed, he's been poor in almost all his games so far, the cameo at City was probably his best performance and he didn't do much then.


Well I like Falcao but we cant spend £40m on him, his fitness is nowhere near what's expected and that money is best spent elsewhere, it looks like Van Gaal as already made that decision.

5684~~~
He's either injured or just dropped.

Either way, its not looking good for him.

5685~~~
Van Persie's been in better form so it could be that.

5686~~~
3 goals - the guy can't cut it at PL-level.

5687~~~
Bit strange this one. If he's rested, why wouldn't you at least have him on the bench for the last 10 minutes or something? Doesn't make much sense.

Not that I'm complaining too much as I'm not a fan. Glad to see him out of the team but he still has more to offer than Wilson off the bench.

5688~~~
Great decision resting him.

5689~~~
3 goals in how many games? 

Aw fe.k it. 
Who cares..

5690~~~
He likely wouldn't have brought him on anyway. All his poor reasoning with subs, rests, whatever, are down to his insistence on maintaining his infuriating formation.

5691~~~
He was dropped. LVG made that clear enough in his pre match interview.

5692~~~
Cool. Deserved. Hopefully that means we won't buy him.

5693~~~
Hopefully. He's nothing special.

5694~~~
Yeah, nothing special. Falcao. Nothing special. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

5695~~~
Hasn't been for us and doesn't look like it's changing any time soon. Not impressing Van Gaal either.

It was a poor signing that made very little sense at the time. But yeah, he's amazing and will bang in 30 goals a season<img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

5696~~~
We're not in 2012 any more.

5697~~~
Am afraid this is the end of him at United.

5698~~~
I hope this is just motivational.

Otherwise selling Wellbeck looks a bit silly.

5699~~~
How does what ever happens to Falcao make Welbeck a better player?

5700~~~
It doesnt, because thats not what i said. 

We got rid of Danny because we had Falcao and Wilson. Neither has really performed.

5701~~~
And obviously Welbeck performs at Arsenal, right?

5702~~~
He should've been on the bench at the very least. First time I've said this but van Gaal got it wrong there.

5703~~~
How did RVP get on today, or Rooney when he went up top?

Truth of the matter is the forwards are just not being supplied the service they should. Once that improves then their goal tally will improve also.

5704~~~
Neither has Welbeck at Arsenal. Or at United on the last 2 seasons.

5705~~~
But what good with having Falcao on do? We need to drop two, and put Herrera and Di Maria in midfield so we can actually start creating chances.

5706~~~
Think that was essentially my point, that we need to find an effective way of getting our strikers some service, be it one up top or two. 

At the moment, we're just not creating enough.

5707~~~
Exactly. Honestly you would have thought we sold Cantona in his prime the way some people defend Welbeck to the death on here. Unbelievable.

5708~~~
How's that?

Because instead of falcao's 3 goals, we'd have welbecks, 6 or 7 goals from triple the number of minutes?

5709~~~
So you agree Falcao has hardly been much of an improvement so far? 

I hope he turns it around, but so far he hasnt worked out.

5710~~~
Don't think it would have mattered if Falcao was on the bench or not. We don't create clear cut chances. I don't think any #9 in the world could have done much today.

5711~~~
He was missed today, yes he ain't been a goal machine which is what our fans expect but his movement creates so much openings and keeps the defenders on there toes.

Without him we created zilch today and those that don't rate him hopefully will respect that he has more to his game then just scoring goals!!!

5712~~~
He is a proper goal scorer there's no doubt about that but he doesn't just offer goals alone his build up play is really underrated and the runs he makes into the box are fantastic, he's just not getting the service that's required. I always like to see two strikers on the bench so to have three defenders on the bench instead was odd.

5713~~~
He was our best player vs Stoke, and although he didn't produce the goods against Yeovil, he should've at least made the bench today.

It looks more and more like LVG is losing faith in him and doesn't seem to rate him.

5714~~~

5715~~~
This isn't based on today, but we won't be signing him. Too much money and he's just not worth it. A few years ago yes, but not now. And whilst it's a bit strange that he wasn't even on the bench, he hasn't done enough to justify starting every game (although tbf the same could be said for pretty much all of our attackers).

5716~~~
Rumours floating around that he stormed out of the stadium, was furious and told his agent to find him a new club.

Given our luck he will be a monster for another club if we dont buy him.

5717~~~
Isn't his wife due at any point?

5718~~~
if we can get back in the champions league there will surely be better big money striker options available.

Unless he has a stonking last half of the season it would be beyond madness to sign him for huge fee and wages.
We've had that rarest of luxury, a try before you buy, and it's nowhere near happened so far.

5719~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Seriously though, I hope he does well at his next club.  Because there is no way we're paying 50m or whatever it was for him based on what we've witnessed so far.  Of course he's a mammoth name and he has an envious scoring record, but he just hasn't proved that he's worth the doe.

5720~~~
Well... for his price tag he should scoring at least 2/3 goals per game.

5721~~~
Might be a personal issue. He come across as a good professional. Whether he's good enough or not is up for debate. I not seen enough of him to make that assessment

5722~~~
Sounds like BS (well the agent part). 4 days ago he said he was all happy and loved it and was ready for the fight for places. 

Going by 'rumours' his Missus was having a baby - but I'd say that's probably BS too.

5723~~~
I agree.

5724~~~
not sure if serious.

5725~~~
Its probably bullshit but what if its true?

5726~~~
Saved 90 minutes of his life going home instead of watching our dross.

5727~~~
He left around half hour after the game with Anderson apparently. So the rumors of him storming out appear to be nonsense.

5728~~~
Players reputations go up by not playing, he was absolutely shocking against a league one side last week so Wilson deserved the spot on the bench.

5729~~~
feck up by LVG by not even having him on the bench, at the very least he would have ended up I jetting some energy into our play for the last 15, rather than us accepting defeat

5730~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Falcao 

Not going to work is it, but what fecking is with this United team

5731~~~
Why did Wilson "deserve" it?

5732~~~
Lol at the rumours. Falcao loves it here, 70,000 people signing his name after being stuck with 10,000 at Monaco <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5734~~~
The same Wilson who was just as bad in the same game and is yet to score a goal all season?

5735~~~
Wut? Ronaldo has 33/28 goals per game this season. Much more than 2/3 I said about Falcao's possibilities. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

5736~~~
Wilson wasn't any better. He's only had a few cameos but he's looked like a headless chicken most of the time. Falcao is more likely to get you a goal so should've been on the bench IMO. Baffling to be honest.

5737~~~
Aye.

For the pace apparently..

5738~~~
Hope there's nothing wrong, we really need him until the end of the season, RvP is clearly decline, Rooney seemingly not a striker anymore, and Wilson has loads to prove, we really need this guy!

But personally I hope we don't buy him in the summer, at least for the reported fee.

5739~~~
He's got the wrong manager to work with from his individual perspective.

Fergie would have fitted him in whenever he can. Other managers would do so because they probably think Falcao can be played into form. LVG's philosophy doesn't subscribe to playing someone into form (except his beloved RVP). If you've been out of the side for injury you have to earn your way back in, or wait for someone else to get injured it seems. Right or wrong Van Gaal is known for his autocratic rule of players and not surprising he's had many bust ups in short spells at clubs.

5740~~~
He means that they should score a goal every two out of three games.

5741~~~
Ronaldo is averaging just over a goal a game, in your post you said 2 or 3 goals a game or do you mean two thirds of a goal a game?

5742~~~
two thirds of a goal a game

5743~~~
If they were scoring 2/3 goals per game they wo

Eh no he said PER game. It's pretty clear what he meant.

5744~~~
Of course it's pretty clear that I meant 0.(6) goals per game...

5745~~~
He worded it incorrectly, but it's obvious from his comment afterward that he did mean a goal every two out of three games.

5746~~~
No it wasn't. If you had said 0.6 goals per game it would have been obvious but 2/3 goals per game is a shorthand way of saying 2 or 3 goals per game. Someone else thought you meant 2 or 3 goals per game too. As the poster below me says you worded it incorrectly so how could it be clear what you meant?After reading some peoples expectations for Falcao on here it wouldn't surprise me if some people actually expected that sort of return from him which is why I thought that's what you meant.

5747~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_%28punctuation%29#Arithmetic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(punctuation)#Arithmetic</a>

Please, stop your bs.

5748~~~
Oh so if it's not on wiki then it's wrong? <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> Fact of the matter is me and another poster thought you meant 2 OR 3 goals a game and another, although they knew what you meant, said you worded it incorrectly. 

Anyhow going way off topic here so will leave it at that. I now know what you were trying to say so no point continuing a pointless debate.

5749~~~
Falcao rumours of storming off are lies anyways. He was at the game in his private box. A friend of a friend sits right infront of it. He was there as late as 10 minutes to go.

5750~~~
If RVP is injured we will soon see what manager thinks of him, increasingly difficult to see a future for him and hopefully we are looking at alternative targets for the summer.

5751~~~
Whatever Falcao does for the rest of the season I don't see a scenario which ends with us buying him. van Gaal has repeatedly stated he prefers multi-functional players and this guy just isn't that. We'd be better of investing the money in wide players.

5752~~~
Well, Wilson was better than him against Yeovil..

5753~~~
Ah, then in that case he should start every game over him now.

5754~~~
Why did we spend so much on him? He's fit and he ought to be starting. Leaving a £35m+ out of the squad seems to be a decision only a loony would make.

5755~~~
Didn't Falcao play 5 games in a row? How many more do he need to get into form?

5756~~~
Well, If im honest none of our strikers should start this days. Have all been useless most part of our season, even Rooney, I'm not sure If he is still good as striker, he is clearly not good enough as midfielder.

5757~~~
What 35 m?
We spent 12 million on him I think.

5758~~~
He's on loan.

5759~~~
So, if you had to decide now, do you cough up the 30 odd million plus a few years of hefty wages for him?

5760~~~
Nope.

5761~~~
Not worth it. I would like to see that money spent on wide players like Depay/Reus and use Rooney as a striker (the guy is the third highest goalscorer in PL, he shouldn't be used anywhere else than in his natural position).

5762~~~
No chance.

5763~~~
Then why did he sell Welbeck who can play in different positions?

5764~~~
I really want to sign him to a long term contract but so far he has nowhere near even justified his Ronaldo/Messi size wages let alone a £40million transfer fee which would make him for second biggest transfer of all time.

One of Van Persie/Falcao should be moved on, how on earth can we have two similar strikers on over £200k per week? Madness.

5765~~~
He is a box player. He needs service, preferably from wingers, maybe we should try him out in a 4-2-3-1. I haven't given up on him at all.

5766~~~
Yep.

5767~~~
Because Welbeck is a tired and proven failure. Among the mediocre bunch with Clev.

5768~~~
feck no. But then my answer was the same prior to him playing and since I've seen him play.

5769~~~
Would swap him for RVP, but for the money not very much different striker which is what we need I would not take him and I like him and his character. Shame WIlson is not ready yet but it may turn around as we actually start to play some football.

different striker like Lacazette maybe? People start to lose their mind when there is a player with big name. Things change quickly. Almost 30yo Falcao for 40m after horrible injury or Lacazette for around 30 with the age and potential and already great goal record. And there are obviously other strikers around the world who are on the verge of becoming top players

5770~~~
It's not.  So why entertain bs stories like this.

5771~~~
Thou shall not speak ill of Sir Danny Welbeck, goalscoring phenom.

5772~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Perfect description.

5773~~~
I'd be gutted if he left because I think he he had the service which strikers need to score goals he would be hitting them in. RVP was even getting frustrated by the lack of service today!!!!!!!

5774~~~
Oh please, Cleverley I can understand but Welbeck has been in good form for Arsenal, hardly a failure.

5775~~~
Good God no. Based on what we've seen at United, I'd be annoyed if we coughed up £10 mil, never mind 30+

5776~~~
Rooney has more goals from midfield and RVP does not look he's about to fall over everytime someone touches him.

Let's stop with bs about not creating chances. I know we're not the most creative of teams but he's had chances, chances that someone like Welbeck would have been crucified for missing.

5777~~~
Not a failure but not a big hit either as some predicted.

5778~~~
I don't think we have seen anything from Falcao yet. When this guy finds his form and the other players learn how to give him the right balls, he will fire yet again. 

Hopefully he starts the next match.

5779~~~
Eh?  Didn't Falcao play 90 mins of every game over Xmas / New Year?  I assume that yesterday was just a much needed rest.

5780~~~
Nope, tactical reasons.

5781~~~
Tactical reasons could mean much needed rest you know.

5782~~~
It could, but it didn't this time.

5783~~~
Ok Mr. Gaal.

5784~~~
A rest? Didn't he only play half the Yeovil game a week ago? He made way for AdM and LvG's love for defenders saw him lose his bench place. 
I'm desperate for him to succeed here, more so than any player since Veron. I don't think we'll buy him not for the money touted anyway.

5785~~~
Google it FFS, it came out if his mouth?

5786~~~
I could very well have been that LvG meant that Falcao needed the rest. After his injury situation, it might be smart to not drive him to hard. I also hope he becomes a part of United, but sees that it might not going to happen.

5787~~~
The 43m is not a big deal(thats why we willing to pay it), the issue is that wage packet. It would be near impossible to offload him if things went tits up(if they havent already). Even with the little we've seen,considering his pedigree I would pay the 43m if he had say a 150k wage packet. Its near twice that though and that for me makes it unworthy of taking the risk.

5788~~~
Why play him against Yeovil, or in every game over the Christmas period. He was dropped in favour of Wilson, not a good sign for him.

5789~~~
Could be because he saw great form on the training ground and wanted to give him games as long as he was showing good health and no fatigue. Maybe he though or did see that Falcao was in need of a rest. I am not sure, but I really don't think that a great manager like LvG drops Falcao in a match that he could have been the difference over bullshit.

5790~~~
I don't think he's worth the money from what we've seen thus far. Rooney, RVP and Falcao are not fast players and they aren't young either. We have zero pace in this team apart from ADM. Wilson isn't ready yet, so I'd prefer we looked elsewhere for a centre forward for next year, especially for £40m or whatever the price is.

5791~~~

5792~~~
Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal said the decision to drop striker Radamel Falcao from the squad for the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30670763" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">defeat by Southampton</a> was tactical.

Falcao, who had started the previous five matches, watched the 1-0 Premier League loss from the stands.

The £265,000-a-week Colombia international <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29011493" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">joined United on loan from Monaco</a> in the summer, just a year after his £50m move to the French side.

"You have to look at the needs of your selection at the time," said Van Gaal.

"We have a lot of players who are coming back and <b>(Falcao) has played the last five matches in a row</b>."

The 63-year-old Dutchman added that Falcao, who has scored just three times since joining United in September, was left out so cover could be provided for other players.

5793~~~
If it was tactical ,then he failed big time.

5794~~~
Clueless if true. Should be in over Wilson, it's one of the stupidest decisions I have ever heard.

If he spent more time on working out how we could create more opportunities, over who should be on the bench, I think we would stand a chance.

5795~~~
It was tactical, he said so himself.

5796~~~
I'm not sure if I hope it was a purely tactical decision so I know Falcao could be back next week or hope it was due to a bust up so I know Van Gaal isn't an absolute moron. It was a baffling decision when you consider there were 3 centre backs on the bench.

5797~~~
Is this  a template for a standard after match post in the Falcao thread?

5798~~~
To be fair LvG said he did it because he didn't need any cover for strikers (although ironically he really did) but did need it for other areas.  However I think he took Wilson with him, so could have been a bit of both.

5799~~~
Pretty much.

Thing is, before he was not getting the opportunities so fair enough, who can show their real ability in 10 minute cameos?

Now though, he's had a bit of a run and the manager has seen him play whole matches. So it is less valid now.

Still think he should have been on the bench at least, he hasn't been awful

5800~~~
Exactly. Let's not forget the lad has been injured for a considerable amount of time AND is only playing in his first season in English football. Add to that he is playing for a team with many new changes, a new manager, and coming off the back of its worst season in over 20 years. There is no consistency in the starting 11 due to the squad being constantly hit with injuries and there are 6 new players in the squad also trying to get used to everything. Then on top of that the defence lost its main 3 starters in Vidic, Ferdinand and Evra so is having to adjust to that too. Oh and they are also playing a new formation that quite clearly doesn't fit with some of the players. Falcao himself is also having to get used to new players around him all the time with Rooney switched to midfield and Mata being there one week and not the next. It's no surprise there is little consistency in the team or any of the players.

How anyone can expect Falcao to come in and play at his best with all that to contend with is beyond me. I think he has shown some decent attributes and has looked like he is getting better each game apart from the Yeovil game where nobody was very good. I think his reputation/wages and potential price tag may be clouding some peoples judgement and putting unfair expectations on him. I agree he has to start performing soon, but it's too early to be damning him or completely writing him off. Not just yet anyway.

5801~~~
I have to say - when I saw he was left out altogether, I immediately though "well he's injured" and then realised I wasn't really bothered at a by his absence from the squad.

5802~~~
And the same after the game?

The 2 guilt edged chances we had were purely Mata gambling and showing good movement to find himself in spacious positions where the ball may fall. That is Falcaos forte, playing on the last man; being in the right position; fighting for scraps etc.

We can spend forever saying we didn't create enough chances, but maybe they would have been chances had someone been in those positions. We've seen it in multiple games this season where we've struggled to create - but against Stoke, Villa and Everton his perseverance in gambling has got him and us a goal despite a real lack of creativity.

I rate Van Persie a lot but in some games his ball to feet, back to goal play is just too casual and for me, easy to defend against. Sometimes you just need someone who will do anything 
for a goal, a Falcao, or even a Hernandez.

We showed Van Persie tremendous faith to pull him out of a slump of form. And he wasn't returning from such a huge injury, at a new club, in a new league. I understand we don't want to be seen as a rehab centre but for people to write him off when he's had less of a chance and in more difficult circumstances seems somewhat strange to me.

5803~~~
The Falcao we've been watching this season would have missed those chances too. Lost track of the amount of great crosses (usually from Young) he hasn't been able to get on the end of.

5804~~~
Until Spurs he had scored or assisted in every league start for us this season mind. I'd rather someone getting on the end of them than no one at all. My point isn't that I want him on those chances instead of Mata as such, but that perhaps more of those chances would have existed. Whether one goes in - who knows, but you'd rather the opportunities than nothing at all, right? Maybe they lead to other corners, or an increased sense of pressure on Southampton and a more galvanizing hope to United.

Even when he wasn't getting on Youngs crosses, he was in the area and making a nuisance, no? And it's perceivable that he will get onto them with more time. You look at the games without Falcao and Van Persie as a front man - and see crosses galore with no one even making an attempt (West Brom for example).

It's not even necessarily Falcao I'm after. It's a player of that ilk who will do these things, something I don't expect from Van Persie or Wilson. Hernandez would have sufficed.

5805~~~
I'm actually not that far away from you with my opinion. RvP has been abject all season, then threatened to hit some form towards the end of last month but has been very poor again in his last few appearances. I thought he was crap yesterday. Depresses me how many clubs have much more dynamic and effective strikers than we do. Falcao hasn't been great either but might well have been better.

5806~~~
For sure. And I hate saying this because it's past, but he's shoehorning Di Maria to striker as a player who can carry the ball forward, break quickly, run behind etc. and he constantly brings on Wilson for this very reason and yet we lost a player better than both at it in Welbeck. Then you consider a lack of real urgency in the box and we've got Hernandez on loan. Which is one place I have frustration with Van Gaal - because he used pedigree and goal records in these discussions, but then doesn't play Falcao and Rooney deeper because it's all about 'the selection' and not the individual brilliance of any player which seems hypocritical.

Our front line looks so one dimensional, especially with Rooney playing deep. There's just a real lack of options and play styles. But to have a player not in the squad who has made the difference for us in 3 games this season against teams we struggled to create against seems ridiculous, particularly considering Southampton's current status as best defense in the league, both before and in hindsight. The only real excuse for it for me was if it was an attempt at a galvanizing statement to Falcao - but if it was purely a 'selection' decision then there's really no excuses for it.

Also, I need to stop editing my posts multiple times after replying. My bad.

5807~~~
Wouldn't it have been a good idea to explain this before the game?

5808~~~
Yeah, agree with all of that. Thinking about what I just typed just made me go off on one <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/do-we-have-the-most-overrated-collection-of-attackers-in-the-league.400176/page-3#post-16961651">in another thread</a> too...

5809~~~
I agree with most of that.

The main talk in the stands before and during the match was the absence of Falcao. Everyone seemed shocked and disappointed. The same on the coach home. Falcao might have offered something different and might have nicked a goal. It's all ifs and buts of course, but personally at the very minimum I would have had him on the bench. Maybe Falcao could have started over RvP who has hardly been in world beating form lately. Why he didn't start instead of Di Maria who is just back from injury and not a striker I don't know. Di Maria could have been put in midfield. But considering LvG said he still doesn't know ADM's best position it's hardly surprising. It just all seemed a bit confusing.

5810~~~
You can understand him wanting pace down the middle, someone who can run at the opposition, break quickly, run in behind etc. but Di Maria has never proven himself to be much of a goalscorer. I think Van Gaal knows Di Maria's best position is in midfield. It's just a position he's reluctant to play him in as he's a player whose risk play he can't temper.

It'll be interesting to see if he gives Falcao a chance up top on his own if Van Persie is injured. We haven't seen it yet despite it being the position he made such a star name for himself in.. We've seen him hesitate multiple times this season with his runs and you can't help but wonder if it's a case of him and Van Persie going for the same balls, not wanting to tread on eachothers toes etc. I'd be interested to see how his movement changes if he's given a chance up top on his own.

5811~~~
The whole thing is confusing to be honest! He should have been on the bench yesterday (and could have replaced RvP after injury). I can't believe this was a tactical/merited omission really.

If he needed a rest, there was plenty of opportunity (e.g. Yeovil). If he's injured then why the cover up?

5812~~~
Yeah I suppose so, but Falcao and RvP had looked ok recently. Given the short amount of time they have played together some could say they looked more comfortable than Rooney and RvP who have had a couple of years together and never gelled.

As said Ad nauseum by myself and others here. Confusing <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> 

For every Krull decision there is one like this.

5813~~~
The funny thing is, at this rate we might aswell have kept Welbeck <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He is arguably a better scorer/CF than Di Maria will ever be, so it's really looking like a complete balls up doing this. I am no Welbeck fanboy but it just seems a baffling decision if he wanted pace?.

5814~~~
I'm not ready to say Falcao's United career is over like some are predicting.  If RvP's ankle injury is serious enough, Falcao will get a run of games as the main striker in his place.  He scores a few goals over that period and the narrative over his future changes.

5815~~~
Well RvP hasn't travelled to Ballon d'Or so it must be quite sore this morning! As long as Falcao is indeed fit, he will be in the squad (and most likely starting) vs. QPR.

If not <i>then</i> he can start worrying

5816~~~
He should have been a sub yesterday but I doubt he would have made much difference, he relies on service and there was hardly any all game. The reality has probably dawned now that paying a big fee and huge wages to a player whose best days are behind him and offers nothing different to what we already have would be a huge mistake.

Hopefully he knocks in a few goals between now and the end of the season but once the loan finishes we should send him back to Monaco and let him try his luck elsewhere. Rooney and RVP don't have that many years left in them so adding another guy who is in the same boat would make no sense.

5817~~~
I would rather any minutes we give Falcao from now onwards to be given to Januzaj if we aren't going to sign Radamel.

5818~~~
I can see where you're coming from, long-term, but the need to achieve top-4 will out.

Sometimes I wish for the days of Tommy Doc, youth, pace, more youth and more pace.

5819~~~
Yeap. I agree. I don't claim to know football better than Louis but IMO we need pace and tempo in build up play, not pacy strikers. There needs to be more directness and speed in the way we move the ball around. Di Maria provides that directness, the dribbling, and the drive. Mata has started to become more involved in play and has the ability to link it all.

In that case I don't believe what you have wrote <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5826~~~
hahaha quick! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5827~~~
It's amazing how everyone has been saying "Oh, we'd better not sign him, waste of money" but then this place goes to buggery when he's dropped.

5828~~~
Well, he was dropped for James Wilson who isn't showing anything this season or, what's more baffling, he was actually dropped for three defenders on the bench while there were already 5 on the pitch (theoretically).

Better use him now as he is already here. While most of us agree that he's our 3rd best striker and for that, he's not worth the money he is valued. Not to mention that our 2nd best striker is considered to not be good enough.

5829~~~
Glad we've cleared that up.

5830~~~
I'd love to see him get a run in the side, but not partnering Van Persie, who if we're honest, has been very underwhelming this season. Falcao hasn't the set the league on fire, but he's hardly been given the chances that RVP has, and I feel he has more in him than RVP does at this point. Falcao with Rooney up-front could be interesting.

5831~~~
I would like to see Falcao get a run of games up front on his own in a 4-3-3 or 4-5-1. Having him and van Persie up top hasn't worked out and I don't see it ever working. 

Dropping Falcao totally out of the squad against Southampton was a bizarre decision by van Gaal, he should have at least been on the bench.

5832~~~
Agreed, if falcao is the lone striker in a 433 or 4231 setup we could see the best of him, id rather him than RVP get a run of games at this point ... rvp`s best is behind him IMO.

5833~~~
van Persie had a bit of form going but has dropped off again. Falcao has three goals in eight starts playing with another striker which doesn't suit him. So yeah he has underperformed but you wonder how many goals he would grab if he had a run of games as a lone striker. Players like Mata, Di Maria and Rooney around him with the freedom to roam in the box without worrying about getting in van Persie's way. That would be a turnng point in my opinion but unfortunately I don't see van Gaal giving him the chance.

5834~~~
If we sell RVP in the summer and buy either a pacy forward or winger it would do us a world of good, but I'm sure LVG/Woodie have serious transfer targets lined up...we should be expected to challenge for the title next season.

5835~~~
No one is going to pay more than 20m for this guy in the summer the price we agreed in the summer is massively inflated and so are his wages don't see any club matching what he is on now.

In the summer he will be six months away from turning 30, probably not have proved he is over his injury and not had a good season for two years, Monaco are also desperate to sell. There won't be many takers unless he is exceptional between now and end of season and even then when you take everything into consideration he is expensive at anything over 20m.

5836~~~
If he is willing to be backup (or compete with)  Rooney for the ST position next year I wouldn't mind taking him over RVP.

5837~~~
Not for 45m mate, no way.

5838~~~
Agreed not for 45M...but Monaco cannot expect to seriously get that price for him now...he can be gotten for about 30M IMO.

5839~~~
30m is still to much for his current from. I wouldn't pay anything over 20m and he will have to take a massive wage cut. Unless he is absolutely unreal between now and the end of the season.

5840~~~
City paid 30M for Bony so 30M for Falcao seems about right, but I forgot about his wages, which are apparently astronomical so it makes his acquisition much less attractive...we'll see how the rest of the season shapes up.

I just hope LVG's fascination with the 3-5-2 and insistence to play RVP up top doesn't cost us a Champions League spot.

5841~~~
Depends how he performs for the rest of the season. He is obviously better than we have seen so far but I think he has been improving. I sympathise with him and Van Persie to a certain extent because they simply aren't getting the service they need.

I can't see us paying out £46m regardless of what happens, but in all honestly I wouldn't be surprised if we had already concluded the deal last summer, and the loan thing was for FFP purposes. The way we have used him so far this season either suggests that Van Gaal doesn't really rate him or we are managing him back to 100% very carefully. If its the latter that would suggest a longer-term strategy.

5842~~~
Even though I would say City overpaid, are you really going to compare him to the EPL top scorer for 2014 who is also 4 years younger?

5843~~~
If that is the case Woodward could come out of this looking pretty foolish. Again.

5844~~~
Falcao was the best #9 in the world before his injury IMO, his past exploits alone warrant his price, even if he is out of form.
If he played as lone striker with wingers around him feeding him the ball it could be a different scenario...even ADM doesnt look his usual self in the 352.

5845~~~
I think Woodie has redeemed himself after last summer. Cant wait to see who he and LVG have lined up for this summer... our CB/CM transfers should be very interesting.

5846~~~
I'm not doubting his potential or past ability, but in football form dictates your price tag.

EDIT: If he had a bad 6 months or season I would agree, but hes not been himself for about 1.5/2 years, thats a long time.

5847~~~
You are right, however he was one of the top 10 players in Europe and certainly one of the best strikers around; even though his form is not good now he is still worth alot IMO.

5848~~~
Are you saying that because that would mean that we had already agreed to pay (effectively) £52m for the player?

5849~~~
I sort of agree. I think he made the most of a difficult window last summer. But if it turns out this deal went down like Bilbo suggested I think itll plunge him right back in it.

5850~~~
Sort of. But he should of signed the players earlier. I mean if we had the 7 points we dropped against Burnley, Sunderland and Swansea which we should have had but didn't as we had Cleverley, Welbeck and Nani still hanging round maybe we would be in a title hunt rather than a top 4 scrap. Needs to sign players earlier.

5851~~~
Yeah, the loan deal was a good one as it gave us an option on a player in questionable circumstances, if we didnt buy an option but instead went on all in with a player coming back from a potentially devastating injury then that doesnt look so good. Unless the numbers are all completely different as well.

5852~~~
I’m fed up with this entire story. The guy is not publicly complaining but his environment does it. It was a poisoned gift when we get him this summer. He has a super star status but not the level. Van Gaal gave him his chance, he played him a lot despite injuries and he played him from the start in 6 of 7 last games.

This story is poisoning the club. Everything is turn around him since he came, but he produced 3 goals !!!!! I’d rather send him back to Monaco and getting another striker to work without all this fuss

5853~~~
Don't get me wrong, its very likely that the deal is set up as was reported.

What makes me doubt it, aside from the FFP angle, is that I can see how Manchester United benefit from this kind of deal, but I don't see why it would suit Monaco, unless they were desperate to get his salary off the books.

5854~~~
Not really familiar with betting, but can you place this bet somewhere ; Falcao will end up at another club in the European top5 competitions and he'll score at least 25 league goals.

5855~~~
He's gotten some chance, but he's still not really had a long, sustained run of games. I agree he'll go if he doesn't find form, but referring to him as a "poisoned gift" is a massive exaggeration.

5856~~~
280K/w, 3 goals and a 55M€ price tag.... Adding that the media machine behind him and then we have all that. 

We're creating a new Tevez with him

5857~~~
And Tevez was a decent player for us while he was here.

He's scored 3 goals, yes, and hasn't impressed too much, but hasn't played a full season yet. He must show some massive improvement for us to keep him, but it's hardly as if he's been poisonous.

5858~~~
600 minutes equates to about 7 games?
He has 3 goals and 3 assists in 7 full games.
In fairness to him, he hasn't actually done THAT bad, he just hasn't been playing enough football.

However his price tag was always going to be a problem, espcially because of his age, if he didn't have a brilliant season.
The fact that RVP and Rooney are not scoring for fun (yes Rooney is playing midfield, but has been a bif naff in the games he played up top in) actually tells you the issue isn't all with him.

5859~~~
Whereas the other way around its obvious why it would suit Monaco, but it would be hard to see why we would go for it. Unless we had a transfer muppet in charge who would do anything for the kudos of bringing in a real-life galactico.

5860~~~
I think people were expecting too much of him. Played pretty well for us in my book.

5861~~~
He's done OK. There are extra expectations on you when you arrive with that kind of reputation and that kind of price tag. "Pretty well" doesnt really cut it. 

But hopefully he can kick on in the second half of the season and get back to the player he was and everyone hoped he would be.

5862~~~

5863~~~
I cant see any reason why the club would have signed off on a permanent deal they couldn't back out of, it must be a loan with option to buy nothing more than that otherwise we must have been completely desperate.

Also there isn't really any long term with falcao, at best he has two good years left after this season, if he can't deliver short term there is no point because as soon as you sign him you have to be thinking about replacing him within a season or two.

5864~~~
He's out of the team for <b>one</b> game and all this garbage is being written...

Yes he wasn't on the bench, but maybe he wanted Wilsons pace seeing how we severely lack it in the side, especially as I think Januzaj wasn't in the mood to play with his friend dying. He wanted to play one striker so we didn't get overran in midfield. Wilson didn't even come on.

Ridiculous.

5865~~~
One of the main reasons why I wasn't thrilled about getting Falcao, besides the huge amounts of money needed to pay for him, is the fact that his management are tools.  The Tevez situations here and at City were a similar kind of thing.

On the player himself, he's had good moments for us but looks too much of a gamble for that kind of money.  He still has good finishing ability but when you're struggling to outrun League 1-level players something is wrong.

5866~~~
We are not playing to his strengths. There is no point in giving him the ball 40 yards out. He is a box player. This system doesn't suit him. We don't create enough chances and don't get an adequate amount of players into the box.

Generally, in the matches that he has played with RVP, he is far more involved. RVP is constantly on the periphery.

5867~~~
If this falls to shit I'll apologise and promise to go back to getting Giggs on the back of my shirts from then on.

5868~~~
It's almost as if there are many different people with many different opinions.

5869~~~
I agree, he might well still be a great striker for the right team and system, but atm we are neither, he
I agree, Falcao may well still be a great striker but only for the right team playing the right kind of football, he needs a constant supply and the team playing a high line, we are niether atm, LVG needs to decide firstly if he can regain his early career form, and if so, work out how to get the best from him.

5870~~~
Almost.

5871~~~
Our club is run by mongs.

5872~~~
So shit has gone down? Or just rumors?

5873~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

That's always my first thought when I see similar comments.

5874~~~
The world is full of clickbait drama queens, so it should come as little surprise that these stories are magically appearing after he didn't play for one game.

5875~~~
I wouldnt be surprised if it actually has. Van Gaal seems to be one hell of a difficult guy.

5876~~~
This. I don't understand how people are already writing him off when our midfield can't pass the ball forward. It's funny the 1 game he he got dropped we didn't get 1 shot on target....just saying.

5877~~~
Which striker that suit this kind of system? 

Anyway, I always like 'my striker' to be 'smart' footballer. Unfortunately, seems like Falcao doesn't fit the bill (at least imho).

5878~~~
Since when did Asprilla become such an expert on all things Falcao?

Falcao certainly looked really miserable leaving training on Wednesday.....

What a guy!

5880~~~
That boy tweeted "Falcao looked happier then me"

5881~~~
You know what, that is exactly how I expect a professional footballer to be 24/7. The money he earns, the way he looks and the club he plays for, why wouldn't you be going round pulling a face like that all day long? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5882~~~
Not sure why you don't think hes a smart footballer...

5883~~~
Talking out his ass. No striker has movement like his in the box without being intelligent. He knows how to read the game and position himself properly.

5884~~~
Was he ?

Squawka only have his La Liga stats for his last season at Atletico but his 28 goals includes 8 pens and his conversion rate of non-penalty shots from inside the box is 23% which is good but some way short of the 30% Diego Costa has this season, Ronaldo 32%, Harry Kane 28.6%, Sturridge last season 26.6%. Hernandez (out of form last season) 22% and 27% the previous season. Falcao's stats don't scream best in the world to me; for instance he provided just 1 assist that season in La Liga. The previous season he scored 5 pens in La Liga in his 24 goals from 33 starts.

Diego Costa took over from Falcao at Atletico. He scored 27 goals in La Liga including 5 pens. Conversion rate of non-penalty shots taken inside the box was 24%. 3 assists. Soldado scored 24 including 5 pens in his final La Liga season for Valencia. His conversion rate of non-penalty shots taken inside the box was 22%. He provided 4 assists. Negredo in 2012/3 La Liga 19% conversion rate for the same stat. The mins played by each was very similar.

5886~~~
Asprilla also  seems to think  that Van Gaal is prejudice against South Americans.

5887~~~
All rumours. There was a tweet yesterday in Spanish I think that came from someone well connected to Falcao saying that things are undecided still but not to believe the negativity and everything that has been in the press.

5888~~~
That sounds about right, I mean only 3 of the 4 players we brought in after he officially became manager were South American.

5889~~~
His game today! Beast Falcao to be unleashed!

5890~~~
How can he not even make the bench 6 day ago and then start today? it makes last weeks decision to drop him all the more bizarre.

5891~~~
Not really, since van Persie is injured.

5892~~~
Anyone else really want to see Falcao and Rooney up front? Perfect opportunity today but I bet Rooney will be in midfield.

5893~~~
This is the sort of games he has to make the most of, if he doesn't make it count he might he will soon start running out of games. Might suit him today quite a small pitch and QPR are quite slow at the back so his lack of pace and mobility might not be as much of a problem.

5894~~~
Hopefully he brings his first touch with him today.

5895~~~
Well Wilson was infront of him last week, why didn't he start today.

5896~~~
Massive game for him. It might be a test for LVG to see how Falcao reacts. Similar to when he dropped RVP for the national side.

5897~~~
We'd be better off with Hernandez at the minute. He's offering nothing.

5898~~~
Another Sheva by the looks of things. What a shame

5899~~~
He'll be gone at the end of the season. He's another Forlan.

5900~~~
There's your answer on Falcao, right there. Open goal and he couldn't even make contact with the ball inside the 6 yard box.

5901~~~
Seeing the replay, the defender got to it first.

5902~~~
To be fair to him the QPR player got a touch which took it away from Falcao

5903~~~
But he's not getting any service!!! Nah, in fairness it was tricky with that slight touch beforehand. Should have scored at least once today, though.

Been one of his better games outside the box, though.

5904~~~
Replay vindicated him somewhat, but it's just not going for him at all.

5905~~~
Shame, seems like a top guy and was a great player but the injuries have messed him up. It would be insane to buy im in the summer.

5906~~~
The defender got a foot to it ffs, what's he supposed to do, use the force?

5907~~~
Hernandez esque with his finishing this game. I would not mind him leaving to be honest because he is not worth the noted figures unless we probably change our system.

5908~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5909~~~
This place is full with poison,comments after that 1st chance,like they could not wait to jump a gun,"terminate his contract now" "Bye bye Falcao" etc. They did not even see that defender got a touch...What a bunch of people.

5910~~~
Only issue with him is the earlier chance which was straight at Green. The other two from Wilson had obvious reasons for not scoring - that was a major interception from Caulker, and Wilson put way too much on the second ball.

5911~~~
the defender gets a slight touch but you can compensate or anticipate that, should have scored one of his 4 chances today.

5912~~~
I think the main issue is he has no pace at all - can't beat a man, can't get away from a man, can't get a shot off before a man gets back, can get alongside Wilson to make the ball and goal a formality.

5913~~~
A striker takes around 110-120 shots per season. The difference in % you've quoted is going to come down to 3-4 extra shots taken. It's a silly 'stat' to be throwing out.

5914~~~
The touch should not have affected the ball momentum and Falcao movement towards it as such because he still had time to position his body for a goal. This is at first glance, but I would not mind seeing it again.

5915~~~
Score one of the other two golden chances he got for a start.

The guy is just another Shevchenko.

5916~~~
Where do you two live, the Matrix?

5917~~~
Should've scored the first two. That third one was really tough because of the defenders touch.

5918~~~
Sorry but with the speed the ball was coming in at any kind of contact would have put the striker off.

5919~~~
Must be said, his first touch has been better today. Held up the ball well and laid it off.

Not much he can do with scraps though I did initially think he'd had a horrible miss, great touch by Caulker.

5920~~~
Absolute nonsense. 

If people want to criticise him, look at the header he should have buried.

5921~~~
Another one he could have done better with.

5922~~~
At first glance, it looks like the time from when caulker touched the ball to when it reached Falcao path was sufficient enough for Falcao to adjust his movement to connect with the ball. It was not like the ball was lofted or one of those Valencia cannon crosses.

It is also possible that Falcao just has a slow reaction.

5923~~~
If you put everything behind the ball you score - Strikers would score that chance despite the touch, no bullet dodging necessary.

5924~~~
Shat out of that last one too.

5925~~~
Should've done much better in the first half from Mata's pass and the header should've been a goal.

5926~~~
You're right - there's plenty there.

First one was straight at Green too.

5927~~~
I dont think he is fully fit.. he looked  knackered towards the end of the game..

5928~~~
Should have done better with his chances but looked pretty good overall I thought.

5929~~~
Was still a good header though, he did everything right. Text book stuff, you always want the ball to go down to the ground. Good movement and then he hit the ball hard followed by a great safe. Same applies to the moment in the first half, only need two touches with his wrong foot to produce a great strike on goal, excellent safe again.

I know people on here are very emotional and it clouds their judgement, but there was nothing wrong with Falcao today. All down to variance. If he would reach this level of play 30 matches, then he would score at least 20 goals in them.

5930~~~
His touch was wiry and he missed a few very good chances. I don't think that was a good performance at all.

5931~~~
I was happy with him today. A goal would have been lovely but some great link-up and turns to create spaces. Keep starting him and I'm sure the goals will come.

5932~~~
His repeated wasting of chances could have proved costly.

5933~~~
I feel sorry for him.
He's supposed to 'prove' himself (according to Van Gaal) in this awful UTD side that doesn't create chances, while also only playing the odd game.

We are not going to sign him, i don't even think we ever had any intention of signing him to be honest. It was simply a case of getting a top class striker in for a year on a low fee.

Falcao has missed the odd chance here and there but every striker does and when you are only getting maybe 2 chances a game, its sure going to make you look bad. Stick Falcao in a SAF UTD team and he would score bucket loads as he would be getting a lot of chances per game.

5934~~~
Well one less game for him to impress now, didn't do anything to help his case today, should start in the FA cup but it's hard to justify starting him regularly this season let alone splashing out a big transfer fee and giving him a huge contract.

5935~~~
I think it was one of those games for him when a striker plays well without getting a goal. A striker of his calibre though, and you'd really expect him to put one of those chances away. He should be taking the match ball home imo.

5936~~~
Header was going almost straight to the keeper too.

5937~~~
So what are the excuses this time then eh?

He's not good enough. He's had chances to score this season and not just in this game but his output for a supposedly brilliant poacher has been shit.

5938~~~
Did himself no favors today. Prefer Rooney or RvP up top with Wilson based on what I've seen.

5939~~~
Radamel Torres

5940~~~
I thought he's had a good game, but really should have scored at least once today.

5941~~~
I thought he did alright apart from the header which he should have scored with. RVP had much worse and more anonymous games earlier this season and we persisted with him.

5942~~~
He's been rubbish.

5943~~~
That's harsh....on Torres.

5944~~~
Should obviously have buried two of the chances today. Looked slightly better in his overall game, but if you're going to offer that little in the build-up you better be lethal inside the box.

5945~~~
He's been very unlucky at times and it's a shame he didn't bury his chances today

5946~~~
Feck me you are harsh, give the guy a run of games and start giving him better service and watch this guy go. As a our number 9 I'd bank on this guy getting 25+ a season on what I have seen of him this season.

5947~~~
Did alright? He was rubbish. RVP is miles better.

5948~~~
What on earth does that mean? He should've tried to hit it harder? He should've thrown himself at the ball like a beached whale? Sillyness blud.

5949~~~
I thought he played well today.

5950~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5951~~~
I think what we're witnessing at the moment is a classic case or example of a top player with his confidence on the floor. He just can't seem to get a break at all.

5952~~~
What Falcao have you been watching? Not one that plays for United at any rate.

And please stop with this no chances nonsense. He's had chances, he just hasn't taken them. At this rate he'll be lucky to get 5 goals this season let alone 25

5953~~~
Held the ball well which is good to see as it's not a natural part of his game but he clearly wants to be a success here - a poor fay in front of goal but any other day Falcao scores at least two there so that doesn't concern me - it's the goal lack of pace, too common a theme in our team.

Wilson is the striker that needs paired with RVP/Falcao/Rooney.

let's let go of 30yr old ageing, slowing strikers and focus on the future and some balance for a change.

5954~~~
Today was Falcao in a nutshell for us, decent enough outside the box, absolute pile of wank inside it.

5955~~~
The Caf.

5956~~~
I thought he did well today. Yes, a goal today would have been nice, but his ability to be at the right place at the right time is just fantastic. The first two were a mixture of poor finishes and good keeping and the two other were inches of being goals. I'd say give him a run like RVP did before we put down a final verdict.

Right now, he is nowhere near a 40m player, but he has shown some glimpses of a great footballer here and there. IF we can get him back to the player he used to be....

5957~~~
I think that he struggles with the robust defending in the league. I think that RVP is a lot better with his back to goal. He is getting good positions but missing far too many chances. The Torres comparisons worry me a bit.

5958~~~
Should have scored today but atleast we have a striker getting into those positions now, only other player who has been doing it this season is Mata and Rooney when he's playing in advanced positions. Note that RVP has also missed plenty of chances this season but we have persisted with him, we should also give Falcao a run.

5959~~~
Thought he played really well if you ignore the few misses. That'll come back with confidence. His overall play was really encouraging though I thought, looked a lot stronger then he has in recent weeks, looked quicker and was holding up the ball and dribbling past players really well. A goal would've capped off his performance but it was still a good one I thought. Hopefully keeps his place now.

5960~~~
I thought he actually looked good today, but luck is not with him. On another day he could have scored 2 or 3 and everybody would be saying he is back. The slight deflection put him off the cut back, the diving header was inches too forward. Rob green made a great save off his header which I thought he did as much as possible with. The only 1 he should definitely have scored was his first chance.

Apart from that though the movement was very good - no surprise he looked much better with playing 4-4-2 and with Wilson as a partner.

5961~~~
Behave yourself he was unlucky not to bag a couple goals today on the shite service we are giving him. This season he has hardly had a run and when he has it has not been leading our line. He is deadly on the defenders shoulder.

5962~~~
Needs to go on a scoring run soon else he won't be here next season

5963~~~
Indeed, for me he was unlucky today, he could easily have had a hat-trick.

5964~~~
Na you misunderstand, putting everything behind the ball means actually running level, or beyond the ball, so if your initial foot misses you get a shin, knee, chest, etc behind it.

ie. more mass reducing the chance of a bobble or deflection altering some form of contact (less than a yard out so any positive contact results in a goal)

When you lunge with just a toe, the chances of a bobble or deflection making the chance impossible is much higher.

He wasn't quick enough or well positioned enough to make it easier for himself.

5965~~~
Played pretty well today, not sure what some of you are on about to be honest. Should've scored the header but he didn't do a lot wrong with it, headed it down, back across goal but was a good save.

I love his battling and work rate, other than score, I'm not sure what people were wanting from him today.

5966~~~
The difference being Wilson's pace and directness as opposed to Van Persie's craft and positional play. I think Falcao looks better with the former.

5967~~~
Yeah....if he could finish.

5968~~~
His all round game was good today but he has a severe case of the Welbeck's at the moment.

5969~~~
Unlucky?

feck me. That's not unlucky. That's just atrocious finishing. IF that was Welbeck he would be getting slaughtered by everyone. Having 2 1v1's in the same game is not shite service. Stop with the shitty excuses. He's just been garbage for us.

5970~~~
Was a simple as the defender's touch fecking up a certain goal, you're over analysing it. If he'd got any further forward the chances are he'd have been offside.

What did he do that was atrocious exactly? Jesus christ.

5971~~~
He was fine today. First chance his touch is immaculate, and he hits the target twice. Then does the right thing with his header in the second half, and is in the right position for two chances from Wilson - neither of which were his fault (Caulker nicked the first away for those that didn't see it, and second was overhit). 

Suffered from playing next to Di Maria, who might as well not have been on the pitch.

5972~~~
Got in some good positions, worked hard, and generally offered a lot more than Van Persie has in recent weeks. Couldn't hit a barn door from 5 yards.

5973~~~
great work rate and looked very dangerous when we went to the diamond - should have been braver with the ball over the top from Di Maria 

will score lots of goals if we have the more attacking approach

5974~~~
Which is why partnerships are so important. The formation opened up the space that Di maria didnt have, and Wilson also has the movement of a striker that Di maria also lacks. 

RVP could play well with that space also, but everybody just looks rubbish with the slow tempo the 3-5-2 plays at.

5975~~~
I hope this awful defence mechanism of "we're not creating enough chances" has been broken today. He had five very, very capable goalscoring chances - especially for a player of his alleged ilk, where the goals will suddenly come pouring in.

5976~~~
You can make all the excuses you want for him, the bare fact is he had chances to score today and didn't. That's the primary job of a striker, putting the ball in the net.

5977~~~
Think people are being slightly harsh on him. Up until the header which he should really have scored he'd had one chance and seen none of the ball because our midfield and defence were all over the place giving the ball away. The defender's touch put it him off the third chance and the fourth wasn't the easiest to get to.

5978~~~
He was anything but fine. Had Wilson not scored that 2nd goal and we conceded, he'd be getting slaughtered on here right now.

5979~~~
I sense some people on here are saying some of the stuff they are because they know we are not going to sign him, may as well lay in to him and all that.

The fact of the matter is he's playing the odd game here and there in a bad side that doesn't create many chances.
Even if Falcao had scored every single GOOD chance he has had with his time with us so far, he would probably still not be in double figures yet.

Stick Falcao in the current Chelsea side, or even City, and he would be flying i feel.

5980~~~
The Falcao handbook of excuses is out again I see!

I do like the litter fecker though. Works stupidly hard for the team, and I'd love him to succeed for that. But lets call a spade a spade, his finishing (which is supposed to be his best asset) has been largely appalling.

5981~~~
His best trait so far is, rather ironically, something Welbeck trumps him in anyway. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5982~~~
How about his finishing? Or are you one those who think that's unlucky?

5983~~~
Except he didn't, don't let that change your agenda though.

5984~~~
His performances have been very Welbeck-esque tbh!

5985~~~
RVP played awful for about a month earlier this season and was utterly terrible against Hull until he smacked in that goal before he went off then we saw what that did for his confidence. Falcao is in a similar phase at the moment and needs a goal, although I'd argue his all round play is better than RVP's was during his bad spell who was basically anonymous for most games.

5986~~~
RVP would have buried at least one of those chances today, falcao still looks unfit and rusty, it baffles me ther are people who think he looks sharp or just needs chances. He had them today and his finishing wasn't good enough.

Would be astounded to see him here next season, we already have two strikers who are slowing down and losing their mobility adding a third would be be completely stupid. Rooney isn't a midfielder as he demonstrated today, I would question if/what the long term plan is if we sign Falcao.

5987~~~
His finishing has been shit throughout but somehow the "he never gets service" nonsense gets peddled out after every game.

5988~~~
He should have scored the header but yes, he has been unlucky quite often. Why is that such a bizarre concept?

5989~~~
I thought he was decent today but should have buried one of those chances he got, might be interesting to see him paired with Wilson for a few games.

5990~~~
He got into some very dangerous areas, it's going to take another game or two playing 90 minutes before he is banging them in, this is normal considering how little he has actually played 90 minutes consistently.

RVP took a while to get going this season too, to be honest he never really got going.

The problem is Rooney is too inconsistent in the middle and honestly I think only one of him, Falcao or RVP should start however it is possible Angel di Maria will move back into LCM, Rooney goes 10, Falcao or RVP compete to play with Wilson because his pace and directness will help both get more chances.

5991~~~
I very much doubt he will have improved LVG's opinion with today's performance, and his opinion is the only one that counts.

5992~~~
The header from di Maria's cross, the chance Mata put him in right at the start of the game, Wilson's two through balls... For a player who is meant to be the best finisher and best #9 around, he sure isn't showing it.

5993~~~
I can see why Van Gaal has gone with 3-5-2 for so long. We are really short on pace up front. It's all very well playing it as long as you're creating chances, but we weren't. I've lost count of the number of times we've strung together 15-20 diagonal or sideways passes only for the ball to end up back with De Gea.

5994~~~
Unlucky how? Repeatedly missing chances is not being unlucky. It's called shit finishing.

5995~~~
Not convinced about that, he's missed a lot of similar chances like that this season.

5996~~~
For what exactly? He had two clear chances in the match - both times it should be noted due to his great movement. The first he brought it down with class and fired it on target. Should have scored of course, but it's not like he fluffed it. Second chance is the header, which he perfectly hits back across the keeper towards the bottom corner. Text book finish. Green saved well. 

Those were his two golden chances. Anyone speaking of the one Wilson played to him on the ground hasn't seen the replay, there's nothing he can do after Caulker defends it well. 

Solid 6.5/7 out of 10 performance. Good movement in a terrible offensive display for 60 minutes. 

He was one of our better performers. If you want to criticise, look to Evans/Di Maria/Jones/Van Gaal - all had much worse performances.

5997~~~
Average game from him today. With the chances that he had today, you would have expected him to score at least one. At the moment he looks very much like he is just that yard slower, and as a result isn't quite getting on the end of moves that he would have in the past. Saying that he showed good work rate and battled all day, movement was very good as well. We just need his finishing boots to turn up. 

Overall I much prefer him with Wilson, than paired up with RVP. The partnership today showed plenty of promise at least and Wilson's pace in behind along with Falcao's movement should get us goals as long as we stick to a 4 at the back formation.

5998~~~
Not even close to good enough at his age and number of major operations for the transfer fee and ongoing wages.

5999~~~
Fine runs today.   Just not getting the finishes.   Not sure yet about keeping him unless he starts converting

6000~~~
By that logic, Carrick is a shite DM because he almost never makes lung busting runs home and ends them with a crunching tackle. 

The two first were a mixture of slightly poor finishing and great goalkeeping
The other two were just inches away from being goals. His overall play today was very good, and his movement and positioning were top notch. 

Not saying this justifies us buying him, but he was actually one of our better performers out there today

6001~~~
Van Persie's overall play when he's on form is way ahead of Falcao's though and he did score two games ago against Stoke.

6002~~~
Well give him a run of 10 games and see if he can get 6 or 7 goals, RVP is 8 in 17 and started a lot playing for most of the game this season and he's had chances too.

This is Falcao's first 90 minute game for a while, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a player to take a few games, same with Angel di Maria and performing to his standard.

6003~~~
Yep. People need to open their eyes.

He's a great lad, but its not working for him right now.

6004~~~
The shot on target, if he cannot score from these positions then really he isn't the same player he was and that's that. The header could have been better but they're more difficult to direct.
I think the service is one thing but it is clear that Falcao is finished as the great finisher he used to be.

6005~~~
People are making massive compensations compared to what we're seeing.

Whether that's down to people liking him a lot, his former glory or just a hell bent desire to believe it's working, I don't know.

You can be unlucky once, twice even 3 times but when you have 4 (Mata's cross straight at Green off his left, header, both wilsons crosses)  good chances and don't put any away - that's poor.

you can make individual excuses for each but there's at least a goal in there for Rooney, RVP or as we saw James Wilson.

Only one poor performance mind... but I don't think we gain anything except a continual selection headache and inconsistency by keeping Falcao - not what we need.

HardTruths.

6006~~~
Am I alone in thinking he had decent game, especially once Wilson came on? Obviously should have scored

6007~~~
Well I'm not sure I've seen him 'repeatedly' miss these chances. He's playing pretty well and working hard, did so again today, and yeah he should have scored but he's still worth his place in the team while he tries to get back into scoring form.

Why are you so determined to write him off?

6008~~~
He was slightly unlucky with the three chances he had, but for me he played better than RVP has for the last five or six games. Once we switched to 4-4-2 I felt he came into the game more and you could see his qualities starting to come through, he also had a good understanding with Wilson.
I’d say he still needs to do more to warrant the amount of money he’s going to cost, but he is an exceptional talent.

6009~~~
Either way falcao didn't do it and that's supposedly what he is being paid to do. First chance that fell to him on his left foot I don't see RVP missing.

6010~~~
Well if you think Caulker getting a touch to take it away from him when Wilson crossed it is an excuse well then I don't know what to say...

6011~~~
Say whatever you want about his movement, but his job is to score goals. His performance today was similar to what Welbeck used to get regularly slated for, especially when his feck ups cost us wins. Falcao was lucky we got the win today, that's all I'll say.

6012~~~
Course he was. Where other players miss, Falcao just gets 'unlucky'.

6013~~~
I thought he was one of the better outfield players today, constantly making himself available and cycling the ball, essentially doing matas job for him in the first half, because lord knows what mata himself was playing at.

One great save and a pretty good bit of defending away from 2 goals as well, Blind was the only one I thought outshone him over the full 90 minutes.

6014~~~
But he has though, on numerous times. I understand people have an agenda against Falcao but don't tell porkies to bring him down.

6015~~~
He has. Should have had a goal at Spurs, one more at Villa and a couple of others.

I'm not writing him off. I'm saying he's been shit so far and we've got 3 players I'd rather see up top than him.

6016~~~
It has to be said, his work outside the box (as it has been for the most part this season) was impressive. But he needs more then that.

6017~~~
I do. A lot of bad luck involved with his misses imo.

6018~~~
Some people here dont know what luck means, a lack of finishing isnt due to luck, he has squandered many chances this season.

6019~~~
I genuinely think people are beating him up due to the first Wilson cross which looked awful in real time. He would have scored, but Caulker nicked it away. In no way shape or form is that Falcao's fault. He held his run, stayed onside, got in the perfect position but the pass was too slow/Caulker did well.

6020~~~
simply this is what happens when things aren't going you way

if he was banging them in, those balls would have fallen perfectly.

6021~~~
Again, I expect more - you can excuse away everything.

With those two chances my gripe is his lack of pace that he used to have to get to where he needed to be.

He should be breaking past Caulker to make Wilson's ball easier and failing that get more behind the ball to accommodate a touch - for the chance after, you can say Wilson overhit it or you can say Falcao should be up with him.

Should Wilson have stopped, turned, waited... skinned the keeper and squared so you lot can keep wanting furiously over the Falcao dream - it's not going to be... unless we're dropping RVP/Mata/Rooney.

6022~~~
Has he? He had a few today, but largely when I've watched we barely create him any.

6023~~~
Agree, offered a lot more than our other strikers this season, just did really bad with his finishing, let's just hope that's down to lack of sharpness.

6024~~~
Plus it's largely semantics given you're just not mentioning the fact that he missed two sitters.

6025~~~
How can people blame him on either of the Wilson crosses? One was good defending and the other the cross was half a yard away from his head.

6026~~~
Really putting the work in, but I really doubt he'll ever get back to his pre-injury form. For the price his investment company is asking for him, he needs to get back to his pre-injury form or I'll see him leaving after a season. Still there is almost half a season waiting so we'll see what happens. Wouldn't be surprised if he picks it up though.

6027~~~
No, I don't mind that one, that's unlucky.

I mind the two sitters he fluffed though.

6028~~~
He should have scored at least one today. He's a man under pressure and it's showing.

6029~~~
His shooting lacks conviction or venom.

6030~~~
Puts in a lot of effort in performance though which is one pleasing thing and he is quality so if he keeps up with that effort, goals will come easier for him sooner rather than later. The question mark will always remain though that whether 48m or so payment for him is what we need? Answer is no unless he does something special in next 4 months. If Wilson continues to impress, then there is all the more reason to not make deal permanent.

Bottom line is, at this stage, neither us as fans nor club overall should waste too much time thinking about permanent deal. If he does something great in next 4 months, club and Falcao and his agent can sit down to strike a possible deal during summer. If not, I hope he goes with some great memories. A FA cup final goal to win it perhaps <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6031~~~
Yeah, we all hate Falcao <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fecking hell, its always everybody else's fault bar Falcao himself. 

'He's not getting the chances, LVG hates him, the formation is to blame' ...he gets chances and misses them 'Oh well hes just unlucky, he'd have scored if he'd played more, you just hate him and have an agenda. 

Its amazing. He's not even our player, yet he has a following so loyal to him that they'll literally blame everything else on his failings. Its bizzare.

6032~~~
<a class="username" data-user="5846, @Ixion" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/5846/">@Ixion</a> 

Some Falcao coloured glasses here.

If those chances are for Hernandez, Welbeck, Rooney so someone who isn't a favourite...?

I long for the day of objective standards - even if mine are higher for a 50M player earning whatever a week - thought that bought goals.

6033~~~
I thought he did well today. Could have done better, should have scored. He didn't. Rob Green made a great save from a header too. Some great work and play. Far better than Rooney today. Probably Di Maria too.

More positives than negatives but by the state of some of the posts above, the anti-Falcao brigade are out in force.

6034~~~
Even the likes of Aguero and Costa would struggle with that  calibre of service. Practically every top team in the world dominates the average side and create chance after chance. This team struggles to create and dominate against Yeovil town yet the average football fan is simple minded and always searches for scapegoats which at the moment are our strikers when its a system problem.

6035~~~
<a class="username" data-user="58513, @Sandikan" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/58513/">@Sandikan</a>, he missed some vs Spurs, today, earlier in the season some too.

6036~~~
What about ones he has scored?  The desperation and blind spot some fans have in regards to falcao cracks me up, It's all he looks sharp, has great movement, it's RVP's fault or he isn't getting service. Anyone with their eyes open can see he looks rusty, unfit, has lost lots of pace, has a poor first touch, takes too long to sort his feet out and today he missed good chances.

6037~~~
Christ this is my new winner of the most head melting rcaf thread award.

Duafc out.

6038~~~
I think he's in an impossible situation. He's under the gun, playing for his job, trying to prove himself in a short time in a team that lacks cohesion, under a manager who has singled him out for questioning in public. We're not going to see him at as his best and what he's truly capable of until he gets consistent minutes in a team that can create chances. His finishing was lacking today but he's better than he has shown.

6039~~~
So you wanted him in front of Caulker thus being offside?

Wilson put in a good ball, Falcao did everything right, Caulker however got an excellent touch.

I can't even believe I'm debating this chance on here, the expectations are unreal, yes he had chances he should have scored but the one I'm talking about was not his fault.

6040~~~
Like the chance he had v Southampton last week?

6041~~~
I never said he's not to be blamed for missing those chances, he should have done better. But people are so quick to jump on the guy it's like they are waiting for him to feck up, it's pathetic. Apart for his finishing he's offered a lot more in that game than any of our other strikers have, he deserves the benefit of doubt to get his finishing back to where it should be.

6042~~~
He actually played well. Could've had a couple but that's the way it's going for him at the moment. I definitely wouldn't drop him.

6043~~~
fecking hell.

People should at least have the decency not to come out with such bollocks when he's coming off a game where he's missed two sitters.

6044~~~
His run can be more in line with the back post allowing for more time to adjust, blah blah blah.

Let's keep concentrating on the debatable one sure. it's okay to miss 2 sitters but 3.

I get your scale now, no further confusion should arise.

Also - he can he ahead of Caulker and not offside, as long as the ball goes backwards or level from Wilson - so stop the nonsense!

6045~~~
Good link up play

Lost the ball less than our forwards have been doing

The goals will come
Our record with him in team is good

6046~~~
You said in your post 'you can be unlucky once, twice, even three times but when you have four chances'

And then since you included Wilson's crosses, I told you Caulker's excellent touch was not Falcao's fault. You seem to want to blame him for that chance, well go ahead, the expectations are unreal though. 

It's also insulting to Caulker to say it was Falcao's fault he missed.

6047~~~
I was thinking more of the two goals from two chances he got In the first game against Southampton. Look falcao wasn't good enough today pure and simple, can't defend him just move on to the next game.

6048~~~
Remember the chance RVP had agains Spurs, took the ball down on the 6 yard line with no one around him?

6049~~~
Well you said he can be unlucky three times. That's your fault not mine, you shouldn't have said it in your post <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

For him to be ahead of Caulker because he outpaced him, Wilson would also have to have ran even quicker, now you are blaming Wilson for not running quick enough!

6050~~~
So when de Gea makes a great save it's because of shit finishing? The header he put across goal was genuinely a quality save. The Caulker touch did take it off his stride too. The chance I was annoyed about was the first half when Mata put him in. Thought he should have done better. Good movement, just isn't finishing them off which is frustrating.

6051~~~
Don't let facts get in the way of some customary Falcao bashing.

6052~~~
Pardon me for insulting Caulker, i'm sure he'll find it to forgive me.

Apologies for feeling a 40-50mill striker earning 340k a week, 6mill off us since September should be able to take 1/4 chances, 2 being sitters, 1 being Wilsons fault and 1 being an act of divine intervention that no striker in the world would have done better with.

Okay Empire - I'm the one judging him harshly.

6053~~~
People know we are not going to sign him so some people are just trying to justify it, to themselves more than others.

6054~~~
Hang on, I only criticised you for blaming him for missing the one where Caulker got a touch on it and you are the one who said he can be unlucky three times, I'm just telling you what <i>you</i> said.

I never mentioned anything about the other chances.

6055~~~
I don't see your point, every striker misses chances we could argue all day about goals and misses but point is when you are on the pitch to score goals, get chances and fluff them all it's not good enough. I would have backed RVP to put one away and I don't see anything wrong with that.

6056~~~
My blame lies squarely with one person Empire.

I don't think he played awfully, any other day he'll score 1/2, I like him a lot and in a different United team he would be unreal.

I have serious reservations about his fitness and pace after the OP and even if he is totally fit I don't see how we can fit 3 almost identical strikers in a slow team already. I've accepted that Empire.

6057~~~
Also can people stop saying he 'missed'? Every shot he took today was on target.

6058~~~
Depends on what way you look at it I suppose.

6059~~~
Allround play was good. Finishing was crap.

6060~~~
Well i'm glad we're still arguing about things that matter.

I'll go on being right about Falcao, and you go on being right about a hyperbolic sentence not massively relevant to my argument.

6061~~~
Justify it? 

Its pretty obvious, based on his performances and price, that we <i>shouldn't</i> sign him. Why would we have to justify something that is so obvious?

6062~~~
I only questioned you on that one chance, in trying to defend yourself you are now talking about other things, I'm just saying for you to blame him when Caulker got an excellent touch is harsh.

6063~~~
He missed a similar chance v Southampton last week 

Poor point

6064~~~
It really is as simple as this.

6065~~~
So do you think he had a good game?

Having a good season?

Worth 40mill and 340k a week?

Fits with RVP and Rooney (both actually contracted to us and proven in prem)

Is fully recovered from the knee surgery and not completely lacking in pace?

Suited to premier league?

6066~~~
Which ones in particular? You've been against him since day one so on you go

6067~~~
no because I questioned you saying that one chance with Caulker was Falcao's fault, that was the discussion, you are now bringing up his fitness to blame him for missing the chance <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6068~~~
You're a tiresome person.

6069~~~
I must have an agenda eh? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

feck me.

6070~~~
So 14 games in a shit team (and a lot of those games were as a sub or subbed) is enough time to judge him?, especially coming back from pretty much a whole season out injured?
People will regret it when he goes to Chelsea etc and scores 30 goals a season.

6071~~~
I've seen comparisons with Tevez. He's very striking to the Argentine from his United days. Wastes too many chances. I think he deserves to be ahead of RvP on general play but he looks a bundle of nerves still in the final third.

6072~~~
Well which ones? Surely not counting the one that Caulker touched away from him?

6073~~~
He's not getting in that Chelsea team ahead of Costa, so good luck with that one.

6074~~~
Also the insinuation was that we judge him too harshly.

All my points are aimed at explaining why we should judge him higher/why people aren't doing that (fanbois)

So carry on ignoring all that.

6075~~~
Strikers miss chances. It happens. Every striker misses chances and the fact that he only had two solid chances today against one of the worse defenses in the league is worrying. You starve your striker of service for long spells and that will affect how they take the limited chances they get. A striker who has trust and confidence in his midfield will be relaxed when a chance comes their way because they know that even if they miss it they will still have mutiple opportunities to rectify that. The likes of Falcao and Van Persie get a good chance in the game knowing that this could be the best they'll get in 90 minutes. They're more likely to snatch at chances, overthink and be under pressure instead of relaxed.

6076~~~
That's laughable thinking I made a poor point after what you said. Falcao was bad today get over it and move on.

6077~~~
The first two. You know, the ones where he hit them straight at the keeper. The first one was shocking in all honesty.

6078~~~
The header then? Harsh as anything. The header was decent and Green made a really good save. First half I agree, good movement and a poor finish.

6079~~~
You said RVP would not miss such a chance

He did 

In his last game

Well done

6080~~~
It would have been shocking had he kicked it wide or over

6081~~~
The header was poor, for a player of his supposed ability in the air. It was a pretty routine save in all honesty.

6082~~~
I want more games before I can judge, the same is true of Angel di Maria, he needs to be playing 90 minutes consistently before I judge him and this is true of all players regardless of their value.

He could have scored two goals today and then hardly scored for the next 8, even RVP is only on 8 in 17, he could have scored today and then had a record like RVP's if played consistently.

I'm glad he got into some good positions and got involved in the build up play, if he can consistently do this then great providing he scores at about 6 or 7 in 10, if he keeps getting in those positions it is possible.

If he is replaced by RVP because he recovers from his injury that's fine too, if he doesn't get consistent game time then it's up to Louis to make the decision based on his training performances.

Until I see him play consistently I can't form an opinion on what he is capable of, also I highly doubt he is on 340k per week.

6083~~~
Falcao scored a header against villa, he missed one today, everything doesn't always have the same outcome. I really dont see what you are getting at so well do to you.

6084~~~
When you're 6 yards out, with the whole goal to aim at, and you just whack it at the keeper, thats shocking in my book.

If that was Welbeck, or Hernandez, or Rooney...absolute meltdown.

6085~~~
Seems like 1 year to prove himself was too much pressure.  I cried watching those chances fluffed.

I find that another loan might be good for all parties?

6086~~~
Schevchenko was arguably the best striker in the world at his peak. I take it you don't mean what you said as a compliment though.

6087~~~
Geez....more excuses. Two chances are not enough now in a game. His job is to score. If he's snatching at chances because he's afraid he might not have another then he needs getting rid.

6088~~~
Yes 

Strikers sometimes don't score 

Keepers save

We are getting there

6089~~~
That's football mate 
Sometimes keepers save these shots

6090~~~
Perhaps next time just argue the point instead of talking about other things I didn't even question.

6091~~~
It's the other way around. People are desperate for him to succeed and have ended up making a shit load of excuses for him.

6092~~~
Again you keep on talking about your other points that I haven't even said anything about.

I simply suggested it is harsh to blame him for missing the Caulker chance and you are the one who said it's ok for him to get unlucky three times, that was your logic.

6093~~~
Not that it's an excuse because I think Falcao should have scored at least one of his chances today, but I do think that plays a part however small. Spurs and Newcastle aside recently, we had some sort of record breaking low shot count against Southampton away, finished all three chances vs. Liverpool, one chance scored and one missed vs. Stoke, nothing much against Yeovil Town apart from the goals and no shots on target vs. Southampton at home. That's not good enough.

6094~~~
I desperately want Radz to do well. Seems like a really nice guy and works incredibly hard, but it's not going great for him at the moment. Should have probably scored at least one today, but he needs to keep going. I'm sure it'll turn around for him, especially if we scrap the 532 and start creating more chances in the final third.

6095~~~
Not if you don't give them a chance to they don't. 

If he smashes that in the corner and Green pulls of a wonder save, well theres not much that you can do. But he didn't. He hit it straight at the keeper and made the save possible, same with the header. If we're classing Falcao as a world class striker (which is what his wages and fee would suggest) then he has to score those chances, he just does. No ifs, no buts, the best strikers in the world can score from nothing, never mind free shots from 6 yards out.

6096~~~
How terrible of them.

6097~~~
Van Persie is actually 8 in 20 now, hasn't scored since boxing day but then neither had anyone else in league apart from Falcao against Stoke.

6098~~~
He deserves the same leeway RVP got from LVG at the beginning of the season. Let him start the next 3 or 4 games, in a diamond formation and I have no doubt he'll start smashing them home.

6099~~~
You could even say they are, I don't know, whats the word, supporting him.

6100~~~
Right that's what I was saying but you pointed out that RVP missed last week so he would have missed this week. That means falcao won't score next week either and so on and so forth. You love falcao you want him to be grat but he looks fecked and today he missed sitters that someone else might have scored. If you can't see that I don't know what else as you seem to be tying to make some sort of clever point when you actually don't have one to make.

6101~~~
Unfortunately, some of us can see he's been shit despite wanting him to do well.

6102~~~
On another day he'd have had himself a hat-trick. He can't really catch a break right now, but we've to be ruthless going forward and he doesn't deserve to be signed.

6103~~~
All we should be looking for from Falcao is a couple of key goals to at least keep us in the top 4 this season, other than that this has been a miss and i would like to think the boys upstairs have a couple of in form strikers in line as transfer targets for when we send Falcao back to Monaco, because the truth of the matter is we really do need 2 new strikers as much as we need defenders.

I never actually expected it to work, you just don't let a play of Falcao's calibre go out on loan - especially when you are a champions league team and you play in a league that is a centre forwards dream (Monaco). Real Madrid were wise enough to pull out at the last minute, Monaco must have chuckled when we offered to pay 6million for a Loan deal.

The only positive to take from this as a fan is that the deal was actually a loan , at least we got to see the present day Falcao and not the one in porto and A.Madrid and we have avoided being Lukaku'd. I really do hope i eat my words at the end of the season (highly unlikely) it would only benefit the team to have a World Class Falcao back to start the new season.

6104~~~
Monaco had to offload him because they are broke (their Russian oligarch owner got cleaned out in a divorce suit). But while he is not completely shot, we would be getting fleeced if we exercised the option price of 40m or so. Hopefully this situation is not directly linked to our ability to hold on to De Gea (Mendes as agent for both) but the Valdes signing makes me nervous.

6105~~~
I'd pay for Falcao to keep De Gea if that's what it meant.

6106~~~
Me too to be honest. We have a truly world class player in the most specialized position. If it meant getting Van Persie and maybe Mata off the payroll so we keep De Gea and an over-remunerated Falcao (and Mendes), I'd take it.

6107~~~
How is one dependent on the other? Do you think De Gea is stupid enough to let Mendes take his career for a ride based on our decision on Falcao?

Whether De Gea stays or goes is dependent on (a) De Gea (b) How badly Madrid want him.

6108~~~
I like him but he's simply too expensive to buy for what he's offering.

6109~~~
Of course I am disappointed that he did not score but this was the most dangerous a striker has looked for us all season. I think his performance today was really promising for the future. On another day he would have scored a hat-trick.
People are saying he missed but the first two chances were saved. The first was at an angle and the second, the header, was a one-handed save by the goal keeper. Even the third had a deflection before it reached him.
He demonstrated pretty good allround skill, with his back to goal and holding up play, dribbling, off the ball movement etc.
I actually was kind of impressed. I am sure next game he will be a force to reckon with.

6110~~~
I think Mendes is extremely influential and will make it difficult for us if he doesn't get his own way. Similarly with future signings that he has control over. Agents have a lot of power in the game, Mendes is a super-agent.

You are right on the last part in essence though. It is upto De Gea though Mendes can easily manipulate him into choosing Madrid over staying here if we don't play by his rules.

6111~~~
Played well today and just the goal was missing. Had he got his goal it would have been by far his best performance here. 

I liked his partnership with Wilson and his movement creates chances. Hope he can start against Leicester as well.

6112~~~
On the BBC live scores page during the game...

Garth Crooks (admitedly he's an idiot) : "Whatever Louis van Gaal said to Falcao in midweek, it's had an effect. He hasn't scored but it's not for want of trying. He's led the line fabulously this afternoon."

Phil McNulty : "Falcao has ran himself into the ground but the goal still eludes him. No shortage of application but the Colombian has not been able to catch a break today"

6113~~~
I don't anyone can claim he isn't trying and making a big effort. That is really not the problem with Falcao.

6114~~~

6115~~~
If there is one position that relies so heavily on confidence, it's being a striker. He is working his socks off in games, which is evident to see from all. He just needs that one game where he scores a beaut or a winner, and his confidence should shoot up again. Yes, he has scored a winner or a drawing goal in the past, but he looked sluggish for the past 2 months and not at full fitness. Today he looked a hell of a lot sharper, and today just wasn't his day.

I still have hope, and there is no one I would like to see succeed more than him.

6116~~~
Caption says:

"We are returning home by train and very happy for the victory".

6117~~~
No one is claiming he's rubbish but were those attempts (taken with his contribution to date) worthy of a 40 million pound striker on huge wages  (aged 29)? Would Ronaldo, Zlatan, Costa or Aguero have failed to score from all those opportunities? Because, at that money and salary, that is the company he should be judged by. I would love him to start scoring as he comes across as genuinely wanting to succeed at United but so far we are relying on a hope that he can resurrect his pre-injury form of two years ago.

6118~~~
I loves how he was holding up the ball and his run behind defenders was class. Obviously needs a goal or two to get him going. Still, 40m is alot for a 29 year old player, if we can get the Price down it's maybe not so bad.

6119~~~
Is it just me, or does he look a bit cautious, like he's afraid to get injured again? The one on one with Green where he did not fully commit and so on, thought he had a few moments like that today.

6120~~~
I think we have learnt our lesson with this sort of transfer(Torres) and Costa is the  ultimate all round striker so thats never happening. To be honest I  dont think he would get ahead of  a 36 year old Drogba right now.

6121~~~
Couldn't finish his chances today, but he does have a real poacher quality look to him - always looking to get behind the last defender, and quite good at staying onside while he does it (unlike say Chicharito in the last few years, who seemed to be chronically offside.) I still feel with a run of games and the proper positioning of the players behind him (ie. Rooney as strike partner, Di Maria as attacking midfielder,)  he has it in home to be a match winner.

6122~~~
Felt for the lad. If we could get him on loan for another year just to let him get a proper pre season and obviously with other players coming in it might be worth it. I would like to think that was an option. Outside the box he did ok but it's just the way it's gone for him. Even when he scored two over the xmas period, they got us draws. Unless we sell RVP or Unless LVG starts rotating properly, it's going to be difficult otherwise

6123~~~
I thought he was bit unlucky today with the 2 chances provided by Wilson - both passes should have been better and he had no chance with either - on another day, thats 2 goals and he is off.  However, though nice control, he should have smashed that volley into the bottom corner.   But he is woefully off form and so he is tentative and so misses.  Desperately low on confidence and still not properly fit.  Its that simple.  

Though his work rate and enthusiasm is obvious, every part of his game is 10 degree's off centre.  And for such a finely tuned athlete performing such a specialist role, that makes all the difference.  Rooney is similar as was Giggs.

The only question we have to answer is to know if its temporary or permanent.  I have no idea either way, I still have not given up and willing to wait til the end of the season. But he will need a solid run of games to prove it either way; but if he fails, that could cost us our place in the Champions League.    Its a tough call for LVG to make.

6124~~~
There is no way any other club in world football will pay £40m+ for him if we decide he is not worth the risk.  Given what we know so far, those are the only terms I'd keep him on.  
PSG may not have any other choice except put him in the shop window via their own 1st XI.

6125~~~

6126~~~
I have to pinch myself everytime I see him in a utd shirt. Proper world class footballer and team player. He's ever bit a utd player and I hope we sign him. Given the run of games and patience, he'll offer a threat to teams that's sometimes worth as much as a goal.

Not sure where the patience is in football anymore.

6127~~~

6128~~~
I'd be happy with that.

6129~~~
Yes he is/was one of the best strikers in the world but in this form he is just not worth the money.

6130~~~
Whether it's us, or anyone else, it has to be a cut price deal. It's all well and good Monaco slapping a £40m+ pricetag on him, but he's not been a £40m+ player. So they can either sell him for less, or be stuck with his massive contract.

I hope we keep him, but I wouldn't want us to spend £40m on him.

6131~~~
I counted 4 clear chances, couldn't score one. Same as against Newcastle and Spurs, for me, that's not good enough. You can have all the movement in this world, and work like a horse, but if you're a #9, you need to be scoring. Simple. I like him, and want him to succeed, but right now, he just needs to calm down and take it easy.

6132~~~
Bless him, Falcao even missed when trying to put his wedding ring on the correct finger...

I bet you he tried though and was just unlucky.

6133~~~
He is the top scorer in the threat league,  anyone know he is getting on  with the assist assists?

6134~~~
Worth is subjective. Is Di Maria, Mata and Shaw worth what we've paid for them to date? Why can't we offer him the same level of patience?

6135~~~
Shaw is because hes likely to stay on a long time and is young, so he could become a top player in years to come. Mata no, ADM, maybe not the price paid, but it depends on if he is committed.

6136~~~
In a few weeks, he'll be scoring 3 or 4 goals on those chances. I thought Falcao had a good game tonight. Yes, he should have scored two goals, but his workrate is superb, and he's always in the box expecting the cross.

6137~~~
Why, or do you mean Monaco

6138~~~
What's your obsession with Falcao? Weirdo. I honesty only ever notice you when you talk about him.

6139~~~
Lottery numbers for next week would be much appreciated. In reality, it's only after the fact normally at the end of their careers and not during it do we ever know how much a players worth. Right about now, there's not one of the new signings and some of the old ones that have justifed their price tag.

6140~~~
He still is, he just needs the team to be more attack minded. A change of formation will help that.

6141~~~
Doesn't that apply to every player?

6142~~~
1253 posts about Falcao? And your problem with my man love is?

6143~~~
£25 million, £180 k per wk, RvP out the door so Falcao can be our 'senior' striker, and look to get a young guy in.

6144~~~
What?

6145~~~
Seeing those two, feels like we're just another "mercenary' club. Meh..

6146~~~
You should get on the matchweek and red alert threads then! It is partly due to being a long time admirer of him.

6147~~~
Yes but there are rumours he may not be, whereas with players like Shaw they probably are, especially at that age.

6148~~~
?

6149~~~
oh, didn't know about the whole Monaco being broke thing, that actually makes getting rid of him more difficult especially if Mendes tries to make him and De Gea a package and expects us to give De Gea a massive contract whilst paying 40 million for Falcao, seeing as we are currently one of the few clubs who can actually afford to sign any player in the world.

If we do end up signing Falcao without any improvement in his performance,we would know for sure that Woodward was strong-armed.

6150~~~
Throwing money around, just because we can, with little thought on long term plan.

6151~~~
So should we just keep over paying for over rated players just because we did it already. He is under performing, wages are extortionate and he is in the latter stages of his career. Mata was a waste of money, we overpaid for shaw and di Maria but they have more time on their side and a sell on value. Falcao either produces instantly or there is no point signing him because in a year or two he is going to be getting worse not better.

6152~~~
Yeah, terrible, world class forward ( or ex WC forward who knows ) who is on loan and we dont have to buy him and a very good, previously wc reserve, keeper.

Awful.

We dont buy - people moan.
We buy - people moan. 

Conclusion of the story is - People..

6153~~~
When the likes of Sanchez and Costa made immediate impact - today Costa scored twice.
These 2 players cost less than Falcao (£40M+).

All top strikers give immediate impact. Ruud Van Nistlerooy, Yorke, Shearer, Aguero, Costa, Sanchez, Van Persie (the list goes on).
Falcao just isnt a top player any more and I think we have to accept that.

Ask yourself this question. Would Chelsea or Man City buy Falcao for £40M+, today? Would Falcao even make the first team of Chelsea or Man City?

6154~~~
You're right. Should have just kept Sylvan Ebanks Blake and make Ben Amos fight De Gea for the number one spot.

6155~~~
What rumours? I genuinely haven't heard any

6156~~~
I get the immediate impact. But both of those players play in a squad where they have a proper role or settled midfield. i.e For Arsenal everything flows through Sanchez. For Chelsea, their midfield is so settled it makes it easier for Costa to get into form and score goals. Our football is so erratic at the moment (almost non-existant) its very difficult for Falcao to make an impression. 

Let us also not forget that none of these players mentioned are coming back from a major knee injury. We don't know how they would be after such a surgery. He's really up against it right now we can be patient, he's not even technically our player.

And as for your questions, I'd say Yes to all of them.

Man City just spent 28.5 million quid on Bony, if Falcao was available for just 12 mill more, they would no doubt be trying to sign him.

6157~~~
Really? That's fair enough then.

6158~~~
I thought he was good today, he should have bagged a goal, but what impressed me is that he got himself into dangerous positions frequently. Much better movement than RVP and he will start converting these chances!

6159~~~
False (Ruud).

6160~~~
Are you moaning about people moaning...?

And am I now moaning about people moaning about people moaning about people moaning...?

This is the madness that Van Gaal is causing atm!

6161~~~
Indeed. But if you check my post I was talking about those that were bolded, Sanchez and Costa.

6162~~~
...are fickle

6163~~~
Leaving out penalties.

Falcao at Atletico (2011-13) - 97 hours, 39 goals and 5 assists

Costa at Atletico and Chelsea (2013-15) - 76 hours, 37 goals and 6 assists

At what stage are people going to realise Costa is better now than Falcao was at Atletico (the era he was at his best)?

Even Soldado had a better finishing rate during the two seasons Falcao played in La Liga, so it's absolutely possible Falcao can fall off as well with confidence issues.

6164~~~
I agree with you. Short-termism and shortsightedness have taken over football, from pundits to journos to fans. No idea why people are saying he was awful today. I thought he was decent and occasionally good, and everything I've seen from him shows a man playing himself back to fitness and form. I admit I let out a howl when he missed that "tap-in"... until I saw the replay, and that Caulker had nicked it.

6165~~~
My crystal ball isn't working. I'm not clever enough to predict how players are going to do, been proven wrong too many times. i must admit, I like the glamour signings and I'll always be optimistic that they work out. Unfortunately they rarely do as the money paid for them rarely amounts to the returns. Still would never stop me from signing them cause they bring something to football which other players don't. The rest to debate, I'll leave to others.

6166~~~
Agree. What happen to first season in a new league, country, team, manager, been off with a major injury, not started regularly or even a team that's in transition?

6167~~~
He got into chances, so I am happy with that, but he has to score, he missed to much against Tottenham and again today, but we at least didn't loose any points because of that.

Again, there is no striker who would work well in this set up, unless it's Ronaldo (the Brasilian one) and does everything alone.

6168~~~
I want to see superstars to but when they are at their peak not when they are on the way down, give me the falcao at atletico or Porto and I would be delighted but this isn't the same player and if he can't prove that isn't true before the end of the season it makes no sense to sign him.

6169~~~
He's working hard and getting into excellent positions, i like that a lot. I think he just needs time to get his final touch back. I have a feeling he'll come good in time, specially if we started creating more chances.

6170~~~
I kind of agree with you but the pool of players of that caliber, we are not fishing in. There are others that have that option and unfortunately they are all going to the usual suspects. Most of the big signings over here are rejects from other teams in Spain.

6171~~~
I wouldn't call them all rejects but if they are falcao is no different, difference is he is a reject whose best days are in the past, the other rejects are playing their best football or it is still to come. I don't agree with buying someone because he used to be world class and other world class players aren't available, go and buy the next world class player.

It might be short term to dismiss falcao but short term is all he has, same with RVP. We need to rebuild a team here and adding falcao makes no sense, I hope he scores some goals to help us get top four, win the FA cup and then earns himself a move somewhere else.

6172~~~
It's purely a confidence thing right now. On another day he would have buried a hat-trick.

Good volley saved by Green. 
Good header saved by Green. 
Tap in deflected away from him 4 yards before it reaches him. 

That's 3 great opportunities he created for himself by intelligent movement and his finishing wasn't quite there. 

Now his pace coming back after this injury, I'd worry about. His acceleration over 5 yards to create space would worry me. His strength holding up the ball putting pressure on his knee. His stamina. 

But if he's getting into positions and creating chances for himself like those then you don't have to worry about those things, it's his finishing that isn't quite on point right now and that's not something I would expect anyone to lose because of an injury. 

He's just got zero confidence in himself right now and if he can just do something to get that back I think he can be a goal machine again. Instead of thinking too much as the ball is coming at him he'll have a confident positive mind and start striking it right again.

6173~~~
I think everyone now believes that Costa is currently better than Falcao at his peak. Thats not exactly a slur, Costa is world class and at his peak(possibly).

6174~~~
Not everyone as I don't think he is. Yes he is better right now but Falcao at his peak imo was better!

6175~~~
Rejects as they were surplus to requirements. Might be me but im not sure what did they expect from a player who was returning from a long term injury? If he was a utd player returning from that kind of injury, what would we expect at this stage of the season and with the amount of football he's placed so far?

6176~~~
Ok well most. Stats wise Costa comes out on top, but I personally used to love Falcaos style.

6177~~~
I'd be concerned the injury has taken it's toll and they look a shadow of the player they used to be no matter who it was. It's been long enough since the injury now to start to evaluate how much it has affected him, was a gamble worth taking for a year and a 6m loan fee, not worth a much bigger gamble in the summer though.

6178~~~
There is a point signing him if, and it is a BIG if, he manages to show he is <i>still</i> a world class striker in the remainder of the season. I'd also argue that at 28, there are some years in him yet. RVP was signed for 22.5 million at the age of 30 and although he is in decline, it was largely due to his form that we won the title, the season before last. Don't think many would argue that <i>he</i> was a bad signing.

However, Van Gaal is right. He <i>needs </i>to prove himself. He's a wild card loan signing. Can he prove his fitness? Can he prove he is the world class striker he was before his injury. Can he prove he can adapt to the Premier League? If the answer is yes to all, then 30M may not be too excessive. At 40 million, personally I'd look elsewhere.

I do feel for him (as much as you can feel for someone earning circa 300K/week) as

1) He's not a tosser
2) He's working his ass off, for the team
3) We aren't exactly creating a shed load of goal scoring chances. 3-5-2 !!!!!!
4) I think he needs an extended run in the side, to get his mojo back... He hasn't had that.

Crucially, I find it difficult to see how he will succeed here, given that the team just isn't playing well and for that reason, I'd wager he'll be shipped out.

6179~~~
Again, I agree with some of your points. The thing is I'm not convinced there's the alternatives out there. That shouldn't be the reason to sign him but I think we also have problem with RVP. I seen the QPR game again and should have scored that header for certain but that aside, he looked really sharp....that aside we were terrible

6180~~~
We can swap if you want

6181~~~
Falcao doesn't have a season like RVP's first one in him anymore, those days are over. He will be 29 in the summer just like RVP was but he won't be coming off the back of a brilliant season, he's lost a yard of pace and will need to adapt his game. Signing him would be blind optimism unless he pulls something exceptional out of the bag, I agree there are better options out there for the money involved. He is running out of games, he will start maybe 15 or so games at best between now and the end of the season and don't see how that's enough to prove he is worth the money involved.

6182~~~
RVP is on the way down as well so we have to go for a younger option like dybala or lacazette rather than add another player in decline that doesn't solve anything.

6183~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6184~~~
He's getting unfair criticism here, Green played very well. There wasn't a lot wrong with the header really, the cross from Wilson was nudged away from him, it happens. Has anyone looked at the movement for his header chance, time perfectly. Give him time and he'll score for fun.

6185~~~
Ok, it's only the highlights but he looked hungry, quick and unlucky not to score on MOTD. 40 odd million is a tough one for sure, but I've got a feeling if we let him go we'll regret it big time. If we can get the fee down we shouldn't hesitate to keep him.

6186~~~
Agreed.

6187~~~
Atleast he hit the target with all chances too. Wasn't like he completely spooned them or put them miles wide. Sometimes as a striker you get days where nothing you do will go in, on other days you just can't miss.

6188~~~
In real time, that miss from Wilson's cross looked like a howler, but upon replay, the defender got a vital touch on it. Can't blame him for that. 

That chance in the first half, a confident Falcao might have smashed that first time. His touch was still good, but it gave Green, and the defence, a chance.

Still fairly content with his contribution so far. Our chance creation and overall penetration is more of a concern to me than Falcao's lack of goals.

6189~~~
He worked hard today but should've scored at least one of those chances.

6190~~~
the header was a great opportunity so was the take down he had. he did the hard part of taking it down controlling it and hit the shot well just at the keeper.
at least he got some service today but he should have scored. rather united go for a younger player

6191~~~

6192~~~
Daily Mail aren't giving him an inch. They have 3 articles up right now where the headlines criticises him and labels him a flop.

Twats.

6193~~~
He'' need to go on a pretty crazy scoring run to justify his price tag. I mean, even if he starts performing well over the next few weeks I am not sure that will be enough.

6194~~~
Newsflash - you don't pay £40m odd for a striker who may or may not score goals sometime or never. It's up to him to score the goals <b><i>now </i></b>to justify a permanent deal, no one can do it for him. He had chances to do so but failed and no amount of excuses will hide that. So Green played well? He's supposed to play well but a top class striker is still supposed to take a fair percentage of the chances that come his way regardless of how well the goalkeeper plays.

6195~~~
I thought he played well against QPR, was just unlucky with his finishing. Van Persie and Rooney also went through spells like this, eventually I think his class will start showing (in term of scoring goals as well).

6196~~~
The header was a top save, can't blame Falcao for it but he should have buried the 1st chance that Mata created. Excellent 1st touch too, just hit it straight at the keeper.

6197~~~
He shows the instincts of a top striker by getting in the right positions. Shame about the execution part. He just doesn't seem physical and sharp enough.

6198~~~
His price tag is £6m so far which is fairly easy to justify, I think 10 goals would do that. To justify whatever we spend on him in the summer he will have to score 20+ goals <b>next year</b> and the year after.

6199~~~
Nah he's currently auditioning for a permanent move. Only justifying a 6 million price tag will have him dumped in the summer.

6200~~~
I agree. That is what I meant in my original post.

6201~~~
I thought he worked hard and linked well.  Goals will come based on that performance.

6202~~~
Honestly, you go on like these were glaring misses, the only one he could've really done better with was the first one. He basically made the headed chance by himself with movement and vision you wouldn't find many strikers capable of and the 3rd wasn't a chance, the defender deflected the ball away from him. Strikers don't take every chance, most strikers at this club have had far better service than Falcao has had.

6203~~~
If you take out his loan fee and add it to his wages, he's costing over £350,000 a week.

Falcao's had £5m (not including the loan fee) in wages so far and had 6 goals and assists.
Soldado's had £6m in wages so far and had 23 goals and assists (rubbish in front of goal; working hard and creating chances).

If you sign him long term, given his agent has United's best player with 18 months left on his contract, it could cost you £100m over 4 years.

Compared to the £40m Soldado would cost Spurs or £50m Bony would cost City or £60m Costa would cost Chelsea or £65m Sanchez would cost Arsenal, that's a ridiculous price for somebody not making the clear cut difference between 3rd places and titles.

6204~~~
Excellent post

6205~~~
Falcao won't be here next season, that's a no brainer. However, Monaco will struggle to get 40M + for him. A 29 year old who's struggling to score.
Personally I feel for Falcao because united are just not set up to provide him with the service he needs. It leaves him having to fight for every half chance comes his way.

6206~~~
For a £40m plus, top class, international striker - yes, they were glaring misses.

6207~~~
Haha yeh ok. This could get ugly with the endless video evidence of top class strikers missing far easier chances than those yesterday. It happens.

6208~~~
Of course it does. Nobody takes every chance. For every video you post of somebody missing a chance I can post one of somebody scoring from a more difficult chance than those yesterday. So what? Do we pay £40m odd for a striker in the hope that one day he may start scoring goals?

6209~~~
Well of course, that's what they do – negativity. Even if it's inaccurate.

6210~~~
The two Wilson crosses weren't chances in my mind, Falcao is blameless for those.

He should have scored with one of the other two but his movement enabled him to get the chances and both were on target, so he's doing the right things.

6211~~~
Why is Soldado being brought up in a discussion about Falcao?

6212~~~
He's not scoring but his movement is superb. Very rarely gets caught offside.

6213~~~
When a striker is getting in the positions and testing the goalkeeper that is the sign that they will come good. Happens all the time – if they get enough games.

6214~~~
Exactly, so being hyper critical of a singular performance doesn't dictate whether a player is worth their fee. As countless people here have said, he's working hard, his movement has been superb and he's getting himself in goalscoring opportunities. He has proven he is an excellent finisher throughout his entire career, that will come with playing time and confidence, injury doesn't take away an eye for goal.

6215~~~
I'd rather have Falcao than RvP here next season. Unfortunately, I think it'll be LvG's love in for RvP that'll be the end of Falcao's stay here as we'll probably go for another striker with pace.

6216~~~
Well I'd also try to renegotiate the fee. If we could do another 6milliion loan deal? Would be perfect. Would allow us to bring in the quality we need to ensure we get him more in the box. With his form, obviously Madrid will probably have changed their minds so it might be worth it. Either renegotiate the fee or attempt to get him back on loan and if he lives up to his billing we can pay the rest the following summer which may tempt Monaco.

Do they give it one more season to get the full price or do they re-negotiate fee based on performance? Cause right now, his values shot.

6217~~~
He' still in his honeymoon period, I reckon. Because if an established player was putting in the kind of performances Falcao has been to date, he'd be getting absolutely slaughtered.

I don't say this from a position of any kind of anti-Falcao agenda. I want him to come good, and think there's a good chance he will. But three goals in 700 minutes of league football isn't exactly spectacular. And he did miss two fairly easy chances yesterday.

But £40m? If he doesn't pick up substantially over the next few months, I doubt we'll pay that much for him - and nor will anyone else, because you can be sure they're watching.

6218~~~
I have this feeling neither will be here.

6219~~~
Maybe he wants to look shit so his market value will go down and clubs can afford to buy him?

6220~~~
You only have to have a little read through any of the Welbeck or Hernandez threads from the last couple of seasons to see that. Or indeed the RVP thread earlier in the season. When he was missing chances I don't remember all this, 'Oh what great movement' or 'He was just unlucky'. He was, as you say, getting slaughtered (not that he didn't deserve it) with comments mainly along the lines of 'He's past it', 'He's only in the team because he's LVG's mate' and, ironically, a lot of 'Why is he starting ahead of Falcao'

6221~~~
We'll put RvP on a one - year rolling contract imo.

6222~~~
The amount of sitters he has missed is incredible, he should easily be on about 8/9 goals by now if he put those chances away, it's like the ball just refuses to go into the net.

No club is going to be paying someone £265,000 a week for that surely, so maybe we can get a cut price deal on him. For about £25million it's a no brainier if we can move another striker on.

6223~~~
Agree with that. It's that movement that separates the good players than the great ones in Spain for example. I think he's perfect if we make CL, and I think this well be a massive factor to whether he stays or goes.

6224~~~
I won't judge him until he gets a run of games for us. Thought his movement and workrate were encouraging yesterday and his first touch has improved, was a bit unlucky with that header where Green pulled an immense save. Not saying we should sign him, but he should be given a chance to prove himself, that's the whole point of us loaning him before signing him permanently.

6225~~~
He's started 5 of the last 6 iirc. Surely that constitutes a run?

6226~~~
And was then left out of the squad against Southampton. I want him to play on regular basis in a formation that can create chances. He was excellent against Newcastle at home but he desperately needs a goal. My point is, if he starts on regular basis and doesn't perform then we'll get a better idea.

6227~~~
I know what you mean but It's interesting to what was the clubs view of loaning a player who's played very little football and recovering from a serious injury? Why would they pay 250k a week for a player that potentially they wouldn't see it's potential till the new year if you weren't gonna sign him. Despite all the gesturing, I really think this is already done deal.....

6228~~~
I have no idea mate, maybe it's to stay on Mendes' good side? As a favour for Di Maria? I honestly don't know.

6229~~~
Also known as Torres/Soldado syndrome.

6230~~~
Given what we have seen from him I wouldn't pay anything above twenty five mio for him even though there is a huge risk of him flying at his next club. I would rather we use that money to fund the acquisition of the players we need to move forward as a team. I'm talking about a prolific, skilful and speedy winger, a world class CB, a world class CM and a starting/back up rightback. We have Rooney to score the goals, if need be, and ahead of a balanced, world class midfield he has the ability to score enough and Robin is still there with Wilson growing.
Having three big strikers puts pressure on the manager to find ways to fit both in leading to this "Rooney in midfield" shite which will only hold us back. Imo a 4-3-3, or any of it's variants like a 4-2-3-1, is the most balanced formation a team can use and we need to restructure our team towards suitability for such tactics. We could have:
---Blind*--Schneiderlin---
----------Di Maria---------
De Pay---Rooney--Januzaj-
                 OR
-----Carrick--Strootman---
Di Maria--Rooney--De Pay*
---------Van Persie--------
*Blind could play the Carrick role because the latter is not growing any younger and Januzaj could play in place of De Pay should we fail to sign him or a player of his ilk.
- in an ideal world we coukd sign Reus, Schneiderlin/Strootman and someone like Koke.
Falcao is a great player but signing him permanently won't transform our side or hasten our transition. Imo we are about five players away from having a truly competitive side and four of those will cost us above thirty million each so I wouldn't be rushing to spend a large sum on Falcao.

6231~~~
You didn't answer my question. Do we pay £40m odd for a striker in the hope that he may sooner or later start scoring goals?

And by the way, my opinion isn't based on just one performance. Van Gaal clearly isn't impressed with him and yesterday won't have helped.

6232~~~
The main reason imo we shouldn't go for him is that we don't need a second, or third if you still count Rooney as one, top striker. I hope we will sooner or later revert to a one striker formation so having RvP and him in the same squad would mean that one is sitting on the bench the majority of time. Add on top of that the fact that he hasn't totally convinced and would be really expensive in terms of transfer and wages I don't think there is a place for him in the squad right now. I would rather see us invest the money in other areas of the pitch and it would also allow us to give Wilson more playing time, whenever RvP might need a rest or is injured.

6233~~~
I didnt feel the need to answer the question directly, I think its pretty obvious I believe its not a matter of if but when he will start scoring regularly, the 'when' coincides with regular football. So yes, I would do because he's a close to guaranteeing goals as you're going to get, what are the alternatives?

6234~~~
He's shown to be no worse than RVP so far this season so on that basis give him a clear run in the team in his best position and see how he does!

6235~~~
I blame those missed chances against QPR on shock. Falcao must still be in shock that the team actually created a few scoring chances for him. Put him in a team like Chelsea, City, Arsenal or even Liverpool and he will score bucket loads of goals.

6236~~~
<b>Transfer News Live (@DeadlineDayLive) 

Arsenal, Liverpool and Man City have enquired about Falcao's availability as the striker struggles to settle in at Man Utd. (Source: Times) </b>

6237~~~
I highly doubt that City or Arsenal would have any interest in taking him on. The only club of those I could see going in for an expensive, out of form 29 year old striker is Liverpool, and I'd honestly be fine with him going there.

Falcao's best bet would be Italy, he'd be fine over there - slower, less physical, less frantic football. Defenders are way less rugged and hands on. He can't cope with the PL and I personally think he's arrived a few years too late to get to grips with it. 

Funnily enough, I'm starting to think Van Gaal would also be better suited to Italian football...

6238~~~
Liverpool <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6239~~~
Welcome to him.

6240~~~
Can't see how he would fit into Liverpool's style of play, but then again that seems to be a prerequisite for Rodgers when signing forwards.

6241~~~
He will never go to Liverpool even if we reject him. He could still play at the hightest level in a top team.

6242~~~
I hope we aren't in for him still. From what I've seen this season all he would do is add more problems to our team. He'd be on stupid money and cost too much.

6243~~~
Strange, I'm sure his name was a big stick to beat us with not so long ago. Must revisit LFC thread.

6244~~~
And yet I think the opposite, and that it would have suited both you and him. Fits your style more than ours, he'd have mostly played up top alone (thanks to Sturridge injury) and wouldn't have been anywhere near as in/out of the team. 

I appreciate he hasn't done great, and maybe he's another Torres and he's done now. I don't think so though. Not the best striker in the world, but good enough for Liverpool? Every day of the week.

6245~~~
I don't think he fits our style that well. I don't think he's another Torres, but I don't think we'll see him hit his Atletico form again. He's better than what we have at the moment (excluding Sturridge), certainly, but if we're going to spend a big transfer fee and huge wages for a striker it should be one who fits us down to the ground and is preferably a bit younger. If it was him or no one, obviously I would take him, but in an ideal world we go and sign someone else.

It's easy to say he'd be scoring for us with the amount of chances we have been creating lately, but Falcao has some misses that Borini and Balotelli would be proud of.

6246~~~
I think so far on his current form the 40m asking fee will be too much, but if they agree to sell him for less perhaps 20 then it's definitely worth a go. He isn't playing badly at all IMO, just needs that bit of luck.

6247~~~
Oh yeah, I don't think there's been enough to satisfy the wanted fee for him. But with how the league is going this year, I think if you had him you'd have significantly improved your chances of top 4 considering the current state of the competition (us, Arsenal, Spurs).

He lays the ball off quickly, he plays off the last man, constantly runs in behind and he works his bollocks off. He's not as tenacious or quick as Suarez but he shares a lot of similar qualities. So why wouldn't he fit your style?

6248~~~
Oh, he still is. You can't attract big names but he has been pretty fecking shite.

6249~~~
Really happy with the positions he got himself in against QPR. Hard to think of a better pair of games for him to smash a couple of goals in than Cambridge and Leicester.

6250~~~
He was in Garth Crooks' team of the week?

I missed the game, but from some of the comments on here, that surprises me <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6251~~~
We'd be higher up the table if we had any fit, half-decent striker though. Balotelli has the talent, but his finishing has been abysmal, Borini doesn't have the talent and his finishing hasn't been good and who knows what is happening with Lambert.

6252~~~
Laughable from Crooks, surely Gayle deserved the spot over Falcao?!

6253~~~
He was also in the team I believe.

Edit: Nope, I'm wrong.

6254~~~
I thought he played pretty well on Saturday. Didn't score but his movement was very sharp. On another day he would have had a hat trick.

6255~~~
He got himself into more goalscoring positions in one game than RVP has in months, and crucially between ADM and Mata we're starting to pick out his movement. Rob Green just had a blinder. On another day Falcao scores 2 or 3 of those chances.

6256~~~
Here's hoping we play people behind him that can pick him out against Cambridge. Barring a typical shite keeper having a worldie against him (Hello Rob Green) performance he might get a hattrick.

6257~~~
So was Falcao. And you'd be right, moving to England past your best is never a smart move.

6258~~~
Still got the feeling he's finished as a top-level striker.

6259~~~
That's just plain nonsense.

6260~~~
Bar his finishing I thought he had a good game, led the line relatively well, but still expect more in future games.

6261~~~
Time will tell, I hope you're wrong but he's done nothing yet to prove that he's not past it. Could we not look to loan him another season, although he'd likely want to secure a multi year deal etc.

6262~~~
Yes, he was very unlucky on Saturday. I'm sure he was sure he was going to score but the QPR defenders managed a slightest touch on the passes and so the ball deflected just out of Radamels reach.

6263~~~
I don't think he played badly but he should have scored a few. It wasn't bad luck, it was poor finishing (by his supposed standards at least). This "Rob Green had a blinder" stuff is nonsense for me because Falcao hit a couple of them right at him. The one bit of bad luck he had was that awesome touch by the defender on the ball across goal from Wilson. On a positive note, he is looking less clumsy and it is clear he is willing to do anything to succeed here. Hope he is in the team for the next few weeks.

6264~~~
I thought he played well. Probably his best performance yet. Obviously needs more games to get this "match rhythm" we keep hearing about. In a perverse way, I'm kind of pleased that Van Persie's injury is forcing Van Gaal to give him more of an audition than he's had so far.

6265~~~
I agree - Rob Green played well but you would expect a premier league GK to make those saves. I'd give Falcao a few more starts but the clock is really ticking for him. If you were to put money on whether United will exercise that option, you would definitely back against right now.

6266~~~
There was another one as well, could've been a cross I think, he was going in for the header but again a slight deflection by a defender.

6267~~~
I've never really gotten this whole "He's getting into the positions to miss chances, so there's nothing to worry about" thing but I suspect that might be a discussion for another thread.

6268~~~
This thread is as good as any to discuss it? 

It's the Andy Cole factor. He used to get all sorts of stick for being wasteful but ended up with a great goal-scoring record. Using clever movement to create space for a crack at goal is half the job. If any striker can do that regularly, then he's going to be a threat. Moving back to Falcao, the big concerns are about the injury making him less mobile. If he's getting loads of chances then it would ease those concerns, even if he's not making the most of them. The finishing should come, as it's something he's proven himself good at in the past.

The big caveat here is that drawing any conclusions from one game against crappy opposition is a bit silly.

6269~~~
It's true that getting into goal scoring positions is a good sign. But for me the standard of opposition has to be taken into consideration.

Whenever Falcao's been up against more capable defences he just gets muscled off the ball so easily and is so incredibly slow.

He looks a bit fragile, like he knows he's damaged goods or something.

I dunno, I'm not convinced he's cut out for the PL in all honesty - just feels like he's turned up here a few years too late.

6270~~~
That's my impression too (although the original post did acknowledge you can't judge too much from a game against QPR).

6271~~~
Feel the same. His movement off the ball is good, but he still doesn't look right on the ball for me.

6272~~~
I remember Solskjaer saying about Cole : "His pace and movement are unbelieveable. To be able to create so many chances is something I envy"

6273~~~
It's quite straight-forward...  

The "getting into positions" - ie making the right runs at the right time etc - is the tricky part.  It's what sets a top goal-scorer apart from lesser players.  
The bit where you actually stick your foot out and put it into the net is relatively simple, anybody can do it.  Well actually, anybody can do it isn't true, some players just don't have the composure / killer instinct to finish the job off, having done the hard part.  But in the case in point, we know this isn't the case, Falcao knows how to stick the ball in the net.

The worry with Falcao in his current situation would be that he his injuries and the nature of the English game have robbed him of that ability to get in behind defences etc.  He's not totally disproved this worry yet, but performances like Saturday's go a long way towards doing so.
There's no reason that playing in a new league, or a potential lack of physical condition would rob him of the ability to finish, though like any player there will always be days when they go in and days when they don't.  
If he keeps playing like he did on Saturday (though hopefully with a bit more regular supply than he got) he'll get plenty of goals.

6274~~~
This is spot on Pexbo.
For me the main difference in the QPR game is, we were actually creating chances. We even had shots on target! Instead of passing the ball in and passing it back out again, this time we actually have someone willing to sneak in behind the defenders. And yes, we do have players like Mata or Di Maria who can spot those runs and pin point their passes.

Please play 442 diamond against Cambridge and please start both Falcao and Wilson. It's exciting to see what they can do together.

6275~~~
I'll admit i said that off the cuff, but its turns out its actually not nonsense. In his last 5 games RVP has had 3 shots on target and 1 goal. Falcao had 3 shots on target on Saturday. RVP has been terrible since the Liverpool game.

6276~~~
He was terrible the first 3 months and the last one  RvP had about 5 good weeks. I am more worried about him than Falcao given his age.

6277~~~
Pretty sure RvP would have buried 2/3 chances Falcao had yesterday in his sleep.

6278~~~
They were easy chances. RVP misses the easy ones regularly. It's the tough ones he puts away, like Saha (only better).

6279~~~
Maybe he would have, but it doesnt matter when hes not getting into those positions in the first place.

6280~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Now that you've mentioned it!

6281~~~
Watching Suarez at Barca and I can't help but think they're in a similar situation. 


Coming to a new team, in a new league after a hefty layoff with huge pressures of huge expectations hanging over their heads and they're just not natural in front of goal just yet. You can't say they're not getting into great positions which is half the battle for a striker, their touch can be a little heavy at times but they are working hard on the field all the same. 

I think it's a similar scenario for them both personally. Suarez has obviously got a couple of years on him and no injury history but then he did cost twice as much as Falcao will.

6282~~~
Following this thread and the Mata one at the same time is fascinating. Mata has no visible impact for several games in a row, misses incredible chances even with consistent time on the pitch and yet a ton of people are still on his side, claim he's absolute class and say he was the best player in the Premier League just a couple of seasons ago.

Falcao gets substituted almost every game, is left out of the squad, watches Wilson play over him and when he misses a couple of good chances in a game we won everyone says he's shite, old, finished and reminds them of the Torres fall from grace. A little ridiculous to be honest.

6283~~~
RVP isnt really a striker who I'd associate with burying easy chances all the time. He misses easy ones even when on top form.

6284~~~
Yes the same RVP thats been missing easy chances this season

6285~~~
Couldnt be worse than Balotelli anyway!

6286~~~
Suarez is suffering from not being the main man at Barca, he is used to being the focal point but obviously that isn’t going to happen at his new club. Falcao is struggling physically as well as with his form, it’s shocking how much slower he is, how much or if he will ever get that back is up for debate and he has a lot to prove in a short space of time.

If we do decide to keep him we could have a problem, Mendes and Monaco are only going to get £40 odd million for him by insisting we buy him for the agreed fee, no other club will touch him for anything close to that and I think they would make it very difficult for us to sign him for anything less. Big game for him tonight, if he starts he needs to score otherwise he probably loses his place and with games running out each one he misses is a blow to his chances of staying.

6287~~~
Hopefully he starts today and scores. He needs goals under his belt to get more confidence. I think he can still salvage this season.

6288~~~
Probably going to need a goal or two today if he wants to stay in the team for next week, what with RVP now back.

No pressure Radamel!

6289~~~
Playing with 2 wingers in a 4-4-2 against a weak side, should get plenty of service today.

6290~~~
Hope he gets a few tonight and goes on a run. Really want to see him scoring.

6291~~~
He will score tonight guys because I have laid Falcao to score/ United win. I wonder how he will score.

6292~~~
I don't care what anyone says, put Falcao in one of SAF's Utd teams and he would score bucketloads.
He would score bucketloads for us now if we actually created chances.
We aren't going to keep him and thats fine but the way some people make it out to be his fault is wrong imo, the lad is trying but playing off scraps each and every game must be soul destroying for him, especially after Van Gaal makes it out to be his fault and he has to 'prove himself'.

What a joke.

6293~~~
All well and good, but that doesn't explain all the chances he misses.

6294~~~
He has worked his arsenal off, watch him off the ball, he's constantly moving making great runs and nothing.

6295~~~
I feel sorry for him because you can see how he's working...

6296~~~
Don't think he's had a touch since Van Persie came on.

6297~~~
Even Ronaldo would struggle feeding on these scraps.

6298~~~
He's so off the boil he's actually winning Rob bets.

6299~~~
He has been absolutely woeful.

Good positions and movement? Weak, slow and out of the game.  If anyone blames the service.....

6300~~~
Not good enough once again, it's worrying that he gives 200%, but this is the outcome. Another match in which he has been completely neutralized, just not good enough.

6301~~~
Costa wouldn't score many goals in this team. Can't blame him much for not getting goals when there is absolute no creativity behind him. When you look at the shots we have on goal, Most are from range.

6302~~~
He looks like anyone could mark him, so long as they're 6 foot. A couple of times he got free in the box but then most strikers would against Cambridge defenders.

6303~~~
That's the problem here, not Falcao.

6304~~~
You are always there getting your little digs in, every semi negative Utd thread on here, i always see you're username. Its not even stealth trolling anymore.

6305~~~
Another poor showing.

6306~~~
He had a handful of chances and his finishing and positioning weren't good enough.

This whole 'feeding off scraps' stuff with him is weak. Strikers don't get endless chances - that's why the top ones are so valuable, they'll 3 chances and bury 1 or 2 of them.

Falcao had a poor game.

6307~~~
Everytime I come in to this thread this guy is having a pop at Falcao, must be still salty from when Falcao ripped his team to bits in the Super Cup a few years back.

6308~~~
Its a common theme ' Costa wouldnt score in this set up', 'Sanchez wouldnt do better than ADM in this set up' you can never tell. Costa is playing  3 or 4 levels higher right now, his hold up play and pace is at its peak, I would Hazard a guess he may well score a lot more but its hypothetical.

Movement isnt eveything, yes he runs a lot but he rarely seems to win the ball, has no pace anymore and seems very weak with the ball.

6309~~~
I just don't think he's a very good player anymore.

6310~~~
I really said Falcao, someone of his class shouldnt be so easy to neutralize.

6311~~~
Theres always the same people having a moan about him and theres always the same people defending,  what makes me any different from every other that says what he sees... other than that i;m a rival fan?

6312~~~
.... They'd have been watching the game?

6313~~~
What a player Falcao was.

6314~~~
He only had one good chance and the keeper made a excellent save. Don't know  where all these other mystery chances are coming  from.

6315~~~
Surely no one can argue any more that the injury he had has destroyed him?

6316~~~
He's crap.

6317~~~
I really disagree with this. And it's something I've thought about a lot.

Costa is more mobile than Falcao, his timing is better, his positioning is better, and most importantly he's a bully that causes chaos in defences simply from his presence and his hustle.

Costa is a top PL striker, Falcao isn't, not in my opinion at least.

6318~~~
I feel for him.

Costa is scoring a lot of goals because he is getting good service each game as well as creating goals for himself. I know all about Costa having watched him multiple times in the Calderon myself.

No offence but I have to take your opinion on Falcao with a pinch of salt because I genuinely believe you have a vendetta against the guy and that is clouding your true judgment. Was it that Super Cup game that still has your sodium levels high?

6320~~~
Just not happening for him. I don't think he's a busted flush like Shevchenko but it's best for all concerned that he moves on in the summer.

6321~~~
People having a go at him today? Absolute joke some of these posters are. 

Denied by a top class save.

6322~~~
This philosophy would make Aguero look bad. It takes so long to get the ball anyway remotely near the penalty box. What can he and Wilson do when guys are taking 4 touches just to get the ball out of their feet (Carrick), guys are taking the ball and turning into danger (Valencia, Di Maria, Fellaini) and others are scared to do anything risky (everyone)?

6323~~~
No I admired him that game I wanted us to sign him before he went to Monaco. I have no Vendetta against him, although I did have a problem at the start of this season when I was taken the piss out of for suggesting Costa would do better.

Sam and Jupiter and several other moan about him far more than I do.. and Retro and others always defend him.. why isolate my comments.. Is it because Im an oppo?

6324~~~
Look shattered in last twenty mins, both he and Wilson were very poor tonight but only one of them is going to cost £40m and £250k a week. Not mobile enough or quick enough for us and his first touch is too hit and miss, it's a shame because he was a wonderful player but I hope he gets dropped for a while now because he isn't improving.

6325~~~
In this system, or really any system in modern football, your #9 needs to be able to hold the ball and protect it, he just looks like it's too much for him, especially in English football.

6326~~~
Not sure I'd pay £4m for him, let alone £40m.

6327~~~
The PL really is the worst league any ageing player, who's just suffered a serious injury, could come to. It just magnifies any weaknesses in a players physicality.

He needs to head over to Italy.

6328~~~
Barely even created a chance. Until we start creating chances for the frontmen - and not just floaters into the box or diagonal passes for the forwards to chase towards the corner flag - our strikers can hardly be blamed. This patient build up shite just needs to go. Go for the throat. Possession is meaningless if we're gonna do nothing with it.

6329~~~
Back to goal, takes 5 touches to control the ball and by that time he's already somewhere near the halfway line. It's sad but he's really starting on reputation now.

6330~~~
He was so so today, thought he took his chance ok though, was just a good save by the keeper.
However when he got the ball to feet, he looked quite uncomfortable with his first touch and so got bullied a bit.
Service to him was piss poor, wide men not getting the ball in early enough and Valencia just completely ignoring him at one point.

6331~~~
Not sure if he is even good enough as a backup striker let alone leading the line every match.  Certainly nowhere near good enough to justify the massive fee being demanded.  I don't give a damn about past highlight reels.

6332~~~
Is every keeper he plays against making world class saves or is he not making them work enough?

6333~~~
Not at all, I like to read your posts generally but just seems to be everytime I come into the thread I see another negative comment from you that's all <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6334~~~
I usually don't bother about what we pay for players but if we pay the 40 something million for Falcao that was reported some serious questions should be raised about the management of the club.

6335~~~
40 million? You're having a laugh.

6336~~~
He's crap
Key word...was

6337~~~
Loved his touch for that, top class.

6338~~~
I pity him, the service to our forwards is awful. I pity any striker that has to rely on Valencia for a source of crossing.

6339~~~
Thought he was pretty good. Made numerous good runs but none of our midfielders is capable of a good pass behind the defense.

6340~~~
Quality forward playing in a joke of a team/system.

6341~~~
<a class="username" data-user="47354, @ItsEssexRob" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/47354/">@ItsEssexRob</a> has been spot on about Falcao all season long, its just some don't like what they're reading.

6342~~~
He's a game lad and no one can question his work rate or heart but there's precious little quality at the moment. Everything looks a struggle.

6343~~~
Like I say its not a vendetta against him, you have to skip to somewhere in the early part of this thread  and the Vidal thread for some reason  at the closing of the  transfer window. Lots of things were said, disagreements were had, which is probably why I am active in here more than would be normal.

I would give him credit when it is due, like I said I  used to love him and wanted him for us, pre Monaco.

6344~~~
If he does leave and goes to a functioning team it wouldn't surprise me if he starts scoring bag loads again, and in a way I hope that does happen just to prove the point against people who have an agenda because of his price tag. Funny how Rvp isn't getting any stick after his miss, while only last week people were saying how he would bury his chances unlike Falcao.

6345~~~
The way we play he's useless. Not only his fault. Watch him play for the scousers and he'll bang them in regularly. It's just so easy to defend against our slow attacks, if that's what we call our laboured attempts to creat a chance.

6346~~~
Agreed. He seems very rushed and busy on the ball too.... not at all relaxed and comfortable. Really does look like a man who is auditioning for a part deep down he knows he isn't up to.

6347~~~
I don't think we'll sign him permanently but he hasn't been as bad as being made out in this thread. Could have scored tonight had the goalie not played like a god.

6348~~~
But RVP looked dangerous in his brief cameo. Falcao had the whole game and was poor.

6349~~~
Much less frightening when you realise he's slow, weak and can barely hit the ball with any power any more. Movement's the only thing he has left; though you'd think that alone would get him into double figures with any kind of service from the wingers.

6350~~~
How many saves?! Like a god is a little over the you.

6351~~~
There's no way we will be signing him on a permanent deal.

6352~~~
He made 4-5 extraordinary game changing saves. The one v Falcao, two v RVP that he can take credit for, and the one on Di Maria's rebound were all amazing. And thats not mentioning the several clearances he made. I thought he was MotM

6353~~~
This is the truth of it. And it echos what I've been saying about him for a long while.

Italy is the place for Falcao, the PL is so clearly too fast for him. And then you take into account his injuries, and the physicality of the PL also becomes a problem.

This is why he looks slow and weak <i>every</i> game. It's nothing to do with service. 

Italy would be more forgiving on his lack of speed and I'm sure he could enjoy 2 years at a top team there.

We should let him go. He's no United player.

6354~~~
You must have watched a different game.

6355~~~
I do feel sorry for him, but he's done as a top level player. Poor fecker. He looks like he knows it too, deep down.

Cue us spunking £40 million on him in the Summer.

6356~~~
We won't sign him and we'll get a new Striker with pace. Then Mendes will be pissed and he will screw us and take De Gea to Madrid...

6357~~~
It's not an agenda and it's not about the price he just hasn't been good enough since he came here, even if the price was ten million at the moment he isn't worth it. Maybe he can improve but he looks finished at the moment and like it or not he is on trial here. It's irrelevant what he did in the past, it's about the here and now and he just isn't up to it.

He needs to go to italy, the slower pace and but more time on the ball will suit him.

6358~~~
Commenting on his performance today is almost meaningless (irony alert), but Cambridge defended with 9 men pretty much the whole match and our striker got no service at all.

Moaning about our strikers today is like complaining about shit bullets fired from a toy gun

6359~~~
The keeper made a top class save, what do you mean not working him enough?

You drunk?

6360~~~
I thought it bounced in <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6361~~~
Wasn't as bad as some here make it out to be, had an average game.

6362~~~
TBH whilst I don't think he was that bad (he did nearly score with the only decent ball he got). His overrall game was very poor, his first touch was heavy and he took an age to get the ball under control when the ball came into feet. Don't think he even tried to take the ball on the turn once, he didn't have the greatest game tbh.

6363~~~
He wasn't bad, but with each passing game it feels more and more like he's not going to be here after the summer.

6364~~~
I was taking the piss about Falcao's shocking first touch before the shot <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

6365~~~
Ffs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6366~~~
It's so hard for him in our 'system'. He was miles more dangerous than Wilson, active but gets so little service I don't even know how to judge him. 

His one clear chance he did well, got it away from the defender, snap shot and it was saved. Other than that he was left trying to head the ball against players 6 inches taller than him.

6367~~~
The same issue with him as I had with Hernandez. He seems to be a poacher, before his injury he probably was more of an all round threat (I can't pretend to have seen enough of him before he came) so I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt until the end of the season. The way the modern game is going there is little room for poachers in starting line ups of teams that are fighting at the top. The man on top has to be more involved for me, like Costa, Benzema, van Persie when he first came and Suarez last year. He has to improve alot for me to sanction the buy, if anyone asks me in the summer that is.

6368~~~
At least he hit the target. Though I feel sorry for him. He must get frustrated that the ball doesnt come to him quicker. So much slow plodding he must be wondering if rather than when the ball will come into the box now. Unless its with Valencia, then you know it will hit a defenders ankle.

6369~~~
He was always a poacher, but capable of placing one (not even with much pace) from outside the box before the defender or goalkeeper could set themselves.

6370~~~
He was more than a poacher, he could build play and take defenders on or score from ridiculous angles with such accuracy.

People going on and on about the odd bit of movement and touch here and there is so insulting to his previous talents.

6371~~~
A lot more tap ins than I and suppose others remember though (some exquisite chips to look out for too).

6372~~~
Someone said to me tonight that his first touch is so bad, it looks like he's been passed a rugby ball.

6373~~~
Like watching a different player.

As an aside, there was a lot of penalties in that video. If you factor that in, his record suddenly doesn't look <i>quite </i>as impressive.

6374~~~
At first I read "Simeone said to me tonight" and thought to myself, "Wtf?".<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6375~~~
He won't be at United next season imo. I think he'll be a huge hit at Real Madrid though.

I just don't think we can afford to spend 40m odd on a striker when we're struggling to create chances for our strikers anyway. The obvious thing to do is reinvest that 40m into wingers/midfield and give the other strikers we have better service.

6376~~~
Although I'm worried that the deal's already sealed, if it's not, I hope we don't buy him, just not worth it at the moment, it's half of the season in, he's spent half of the time on the operating table and hasn't impressed in the matches he's played. Nothing personal, like the guy myself but just no.

6377~~~
Our whole team is being neutralized, not just him. It is so easy to defend against us and that's the problem. That was a strong team and Cambridge dealt with us quite easily.

6378~~~
He wont get close to their first team in this kind of form.

6379~~~
Despertely want him to score at this stage - even just one goal to take a bit of pressure off him; a brace or even an hat-trick might be a game-changer for him confidence-wise but it's just not getting past that first goal in games nevermind any more.

6380~~~
Im not convinced by this ' he'll be a hit at any other team' thing either. His problems are more than just service and formation.

6381~~~
Nah, he's always in the right positions, he's been unlucky in front of goal at times but he's making the right runs and his movement is good. We just don't play the ball quick enough to him, Shearer had it nailed at half time. He'd get significantly better service at Real Madrid.

6382~~~
The way he's going it's inevitable he'll drop to the bench when Rooney and Mata return. RVP while not performing that well either still has an air of self belief in his own play which Falcao seriously is lacking. And by which stage with us not being in Europe the games will start to run out for him to justify the transfer fee.

6383~~~
I agree.

6384~~~
Lucky to get into Castilla at this rate.

6385~~~
xoxo

Lets chase off Rob! He knows nothing. I actually think Costa would struggle in our current team, we're seriously that crap. Our service is utterly awful Rob, I noticed a trend during the 2nd half where some of our players actually preferred sending the ball left than spreading it to Valencia who was in space on the right. It's depressing how awful our wingers are when during the 90's it was our biggest strength.

6386~~~
Shhh. All he needs is a goal and he'll be back to his best. A goal will magically fix his broken legs.

Replace the word 'unlucky' with the word 'shit' and you're closer to the mark.

And he wouldn't get into the team ahead of Benzema. They already turned him down this season, and I doubt they've seen anything to make them regret that decision. In fact, they're probably counting their blessings.

6387~~~
No chance they give up what Benzema provides for Falcao. They've got him doing donkey work while scoring and assisting 20 a year. Benzema is perfect for them.

Besides how does Falcao keep up with Ronaldo and Bale.

6388~~~
Could see a Lazio or someone like that getting 12-15 goals out of him maybe.

6389~~~
We'll see in the Summer who's right. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6390~~~
That would be fine if the only issue was he was missing chances but it isn't. He just looks so slow compared to the physical, explosive forward he was before and his touch is so poor. I wouldn't claim to watch loads of foreign football barring La Liga but surely there's a young, dynamic striker who could add a lot more than spunking 40m on a 29 year old who looks past his best. Also, he wouldn't get anywhere near Real Madrid's team on current form, Benzema is streets ahead of him.

6391~~~
Carlos Bacca might do. Also Colombian of course.

6392~~~
We have RvP, Rooney <i>and</i> Falcao, all of whom have looked average as a striker this year. The service has been the worst I have seen in my time of watching football, and 3 supposed world class strikers have looked so out of place that it is just baffling to watch at times.

6393~~~
People say this all the time about players who are out of form though. Then suddenly said player regains some match sharpness and they look back to their best. I don't expect him to go over to Madrid and score 30 goals, but he is not as bad as this season suggests. He's just playing for a very mediocre attacking team who struggles to create chances in every game they play in. It wasn't long ago that half the forum thought RvP was finished and then he regained a bit of form and looked good again.

I don't envy any striker that has the service that the players produced tonight. It's not a one off either. We've struggled to create chances all season and that isn't down to our strikers not being good enough. He has been disappointing at United, but I think United have been very disappointing all season, so that's hardly a good indicator that said player is finished.

6394~~~
He makes some quality runs in behind plenty of times in games but our players would rather go for the safe pass, I feel sorry for him, any striker would struggle with the type of service he gets

6395~~~
I'm not going to argue that United aren't playing like shit, we obviously are but for how long can we call this just form for Falcao? He wasn't as great as expected at Monaco (in a weaker league) and then suffered a terrible injury. Like all United fans I want him to be good for us but these comments about how he'd thrive in other teams are pointless, we're crap and he hardly merits a place in our side. The likes of Costa and Aguero would not be as impressive as they have been if they played for United but at least they'd be sharp in front, they'd worry defenders and they'd hold onto the ball a lot better. He's never had the quality of technique that Van Persie (who as it happens is clearly a shadow of the player he once was) has to rely upon as his physical capabilities have lessened.

6396~~~
quite good work with the ball, but not enough in this system he would benefit much more from being played as a lone striker in 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 which is not happening until we buys some wingers defenders and midfielders in the summer for hundreds of millions pounds. 

Would swap him for RVP who is definitely becoming average striker and shouldn't start a game for us. 

On top of that I don't think that Welbeck would do any worse than any of our strikers as they really struggle to take their chances this year.. but I get it this story is over..

6397~~~
Agreed. There is currently no service at all at the moment because we are too busy pissing about with it at the back. Falcao isn't the problem.

6398~~~
He also lacks mobility, is slow and has a really unreliable first touch, he does lack service but he has also not been good enough and even though I agree the service isn't good enough there are other players who would not be struggling as much because their all round game is better.

6399~~~
Hardly regained his form, he simply had two games and now he continues in his super poor form. I don't even think it is " a form" it is just his current standard which is lower and lower season after season. Of course people will start to believe that he is coming to his best when he scores a goal or two because we really hope for that to happen and are trying to be optimists but he it is clear that he is becoming not top club material at least not for a starter. He is one dimensional striker who needs support, can't beat a player, cant stretch the play or press the defenders. On the other hand I agree with you that he is like Falcao little unfortunate that we are playing current system in which both are not effective yet it was the reason why we went for this system because we have "world class strikers" - it is funny. But everyone knew it will not work. Hopefully we will not stick to this nonsense and use this extra player from attack in midfield where we definitely need him. And maybe the the strieker will get more support and even striker like RVP can look more effective like he can still do some job for us.. Right now I can't see an effective role for either of our no9s but I would take Falcao over RVP any day.. he at least looks like he tries and looks younger in his movement..

6400~~~
Its so frustrating but people would rather say hes rubbish, fair enough he should have banged a few against QPR and Spurs but other than that nobody is lifting their head up and looking what he is doing, RVP has the same problems at times but is better at dropping deeper, hes a quality player but only certain players can do it all themselves

The amount of time tonight I seen us pick up the ball in the second half and seen him hanging on the shoulder looking for a threw ball and we played it out to Valencia or Blind, Im happy that he is trying and isnt doing a Berbatov and hiding

6401~~~
Thats true but I dont think his game is dropping deep with back to goal, its playing off the shoulder and arriving late into the box, he got one quality pass all game today which he nearly put away, same against Yeovil too, other than that it was high balls and terrible crosses, Mata and di Maria seem to be the only players who understand the type of balls he wants, I used to be a striker and recieve rubbish over the top balls that were a nightmare to control let alone finish, so I know how frustrating it can be

6402~~~
Give him ammunition and he will get us goals! Service to our forwards is abysmal

6403~~~
This is a great point. We have 3 strikers that 18 out of 20 teams in this league would love and we can't make it work? Do you look at the strikers or the team? Would Aguero or Costa score the same number of goals in this United team. We are so slow, it's painful to watch and easy to defend against.

6404~~~
Yep.

6405~~~
Not a chance in hell. When Rooney scored his 34 goals that season, he was getting service from the likes of a fantastic Valencia and other suppliers. You cut out that sort of play and delivery, and you're left with little.

6406~~~
And people are still calling him unlucky<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Poor unlukcy Falcao. How dare a 'keeper try to save any of his shots!

He's not good enough. Plain and simple.

6407~~~
You can tell as soon as this guy leaves and goes somewhere is he will be banging them in for fun. No doubt meeting us again somewhere down the line.

I think you can see from the start he has the problem a lot of players get coming back from such a major injury in football. It is having the confidence in your body to really commit yourself to situations he seems like he is still trying to protect himself at times. Needs to get over the psychological barrier which  I cannot see him doing until the pressure is off him a little which will only be if we do sign him.

Combine coming back from an injury like this and going straight into a misfiring United team creating a lack of chances is never going to be easy. Personally think with most of his chances you can't fault him he hits the target unlike many and when his luck is in can see him being deadly.

6408~~~
bloody hell mate fair enough if hes missing sitter after sitter but hes feeding off scraps that much is clear, yeah he could of put one away against Spurs but we arent feeding him with anything but high crosses and over hit passes

6409~~~
He's a world class striker, playing in a team that makes him look hapless and useless.

He was fed one good ball tonight after 65 mins.....And their keeper made a fantastic save.
Other then that, he was feeding off die cross after dire cross. 

Not his fault....What you want him to do?! Go into midfield, dribble past a few players, feed it out to the wing and score a bicycle kick and repeat?! 

He's a striker.....The team should be feeding him

6410~~~
He could have also scored against QPR and against Cambridge.

Stop trotting out "He's feeding off scraps" every time he misses chances. He's been shit so far and yet people continue to blame anyone and everyone but the Falcao himself.

6411~~~
No, he's not. Maybe he was at one point but that's entirely irrelevant now.

6412~~~
Anyone complaining about his performance today is just basing it on his entire season so far, rather than just tonight. Isolate the perception of his overall season so far, and everyone here would be saying that he had absolutely feck all service to work with in this match..

6413~~~
He's at the wrong club to play after such an injury. For a striker like him, he needed to play for a team providing several chances per matches in order to get his shooting boots back. Now he knows there isn't much creativity so the only chance he gets, he has this crazy pressure to score from it.

6414~~~
None of our strikers have had ANY sort of the service you would expect from a top european club. if robin van persie and radamel falcao are struggling to even get 2 or more shots on target in a game, i think its time to look at the service recieved.

you put Falcao or van persie upfront for Liverpool, chelsea, city, southampton etc etc, and they would be rolling in goals.

6415~~~
Falcao wouldn't be anywhere <i>near</i> the threat that Costa or Aguero are if he was at Chelsea or City. Same at Liverpool and Southampton. He isn't a player cut out for the PL.

He's weak, slow and is easily marked - these are factors that've also contributed to his poor form here thus far. It isn't simply that he's feeding off scraps. In many games he's so easily marked, out-muscled and out ran that it's difficult for the midfield to consistently find him. It works both ways.

If we're saying that we now want forwards who are only any use when they have point perfect passes placed on their feet then we'd be better just bringing Hernandez back from Real Madrid.

Besides, Falcao has had games where he's had plenty of chances created for him, but hasn't scored. His movement is still good and that will get him some goals, but even then he's so easily out-ran and out muscled that he'll never be the danger man of a Costa, Aguero, Sanchez, Rooney etc. At least not in the Prem.

6416~~~
Falcao thrives on balls being whipped into the box. He barely gets any. He does not thrive on receiving the ball 40 yards from the goal. Yet that's what we seem to want to do. We need to get balls and crosses in particular into the box. Falcao will score goals. I don't know why we don't seem to want to get the best out of him

6417~~~
No service at all. Don't think that's even debatable, we're creating no chances.

6418~~~
People will continue to blame our world class strikers when our midfield is brain dead. In 90 minutes against a League two side we could only provide one goal scoring opportunity to  Falcao. But its our strikers who are crap. Some of you would spend 80 million on a new striker and then sulk about it when he goes on a run of poor goal scoring form because our midfield is too shite to create chances for him.

6419~~~
No it's not his game especially now the injury has taken a lot out of him but I don't think being a poacher is enough for the money involved or even if that is the sort of player we should be trying to sign. To be a top striker in this league I think you have to be more than just a poacher now and sadly he can't offer that, he has arrived in the league 2-3 years too late.

The service does need to be better but if he can't take the ball on the turn or even control it to hold onto it a lot of the time I don't think that is good enough no matter how bd the midfield is at times.

6420~~~
The trouble is here  50% of people are too unwilling ever to blame players, probably due to fees and previous expectations.

The midfield is supposedly to blame for the strikers,  but then when you go to blame the creators its  suddenly the formation, as though these changes actually make a player suddenly unable to control a ball or have a  good touch. If Falcao was running around all game having zero touches I could understand it, but I see balls played to him that he simply cant reach for pace anymore, he always seems a yard behind, his touch is poor and struggles to protect the ball.

These things arent to do with the service, look at the Atletico vids and tell me all of that was excellent service.

Costa and Sanchez would be perfect fit for  this United team right now, even Aguero, because all can do things without needing the ball fed to them from 5 yards out perfectly.

6421~~~
I think that sums it up pretty well, falcao isn't going to just go back to the player he was with better service no doubt he would score more but who wouldn't. The poor first touch, his complete lack of pace, inability to drag defenders out of position, hold the ball up or dribble past players are all issues that aren't going away. He just isn't the player he was and that combined with playing in a very ordinary side just isn't working at all and I hope he doesn't start the next game.

6422~~~
Hilarious. You really do believe the rubbish you come out with don't you? It's very simple to sit there and say this player or that player would fit in, but reality is each player we have signed is struggling one way or another. If last season you said Falcao and Di Maria would be signing for United you would believe they would be much better. Falcao never was this player you speak of, who dribbles past defenders. He's always been about movement and top class finishing. You can see he's trying harder than anyone else. The whole United team right now is a mess, and none, yes none of our attacking players are able to bail us out right now. That includes PL veterans like Rooney and RVP. Falcao is like a better version of Hernandez. He lost the ball more than most players in la liga. How much did you watch him?

Do you watch all of our games? Did you see Southampton? We didn't create one chance. Did you see Southampton away? We created 1 half chance the whole game and scored 2. Falcao's strength isn't holding the ball up 40 yards away from goal, or running channels to give others space.

6423~~~
For a moment I thought you were describing RVP. In case you haven't noticed, he can't dribble past players, drag defenders out of position or hold up the ball and his pace has all but disappeared.

It's not the formation, it's the strategy. You can't ignore the specific talents of your players. The slow pace and steady build up ideal for the 3-5-2 are a terrible fit for most of our offensive players. Dí Maria is much better increasing the pace with ball in feet, not trying to catch it in space behind the defense. Rooney is about the same. Valencia and Young are much better going full speed than trying to dribble from a stand. Shaw and Rafael are about the same. Falcao's real talent is staying right on the edge of the outside trap and beating defenders with short accelerations in the box. That's how he got the 2 chances against QPR (left foot effort in the first half and the header in the second). The other chances we created in that game were when QPR pushed forward and Wilson and Falcao got in behind the defense with pace and space.

6424~~~
Januzaj put in about 3 or 4 great crosses yesterday, plus a couple from Blind, and Falcao was nowhere near any of them. The excuses that people keep rolling out for the lad are borderline cult like.

A lack of service, or poor build up play, has absolutely nothing to do with Falcao's, quite clear, physical problems. Never mind his first touch, nor the fact that when he has had chances (and he's had plenty) he's missed most of them. Yet, once again, thats everyone elses fault because he should need 4/5 chances to get his shooting boots on, which kind of defeats the whole argument that he's a 'world class' striker, plus against Spurs he got his 4/5 chances and missed them all.

Just give it up guys, he's a busted flush. Its Shevnchenko and Torres all over again.

6425~~~
The way I see it is that the service hasn't been great but we've seen enough in terms of controls, shooting and movement to just accept Falcao is a shadow of his former self.

6426~~~
Absolutely.

6427~~~
Maybe? He was clearly world class for a few years (arguably the best striker in the world). Whether he ever gets back to that level is another matter.

6428~~~
Read something vague about Mendes commenting to La Sexta that "Falcao most likely won't play for United next season. He wished Falcao had worked with Ferguson, Falcao is a player who has to play for 90 minutes, and he himself doesn't understand why he's not playing."

Then he went on to comment that "Falcao will play for a top 7 club in the world next year, not Real Madrid" says Mendes, because "they already have Benzema". Obviously Mendes is a bit of hypocrite, since money equals succes if you look at his business, and he was the one who brought his beloved Falcao to Monaco and made good money off that.

But I don't know how old these quotes are and if it has been discussed to death on here already.

6429~~~
His movement is as good as I've ever seen it. Control is off but getting better. Finishing is what worries me. I'd have thought that would come back first.

6430~~~
He's been no worse than Suarez, all the while playing in a less functional, less talented, less creative team. I take it Suarez is shit now, too? This thread is shocking. Should be locked.

6431~~~
RVP has a better touch but I agree he is on the slide and that is what is even more worrying about falcao he is a few years younger and he is on the slide as well and why do we want to add another player like that. thankfully I don't think there is any chance falcao will be here next year whatever the price, he can do a job somewhere else but writing is already on the wall.

6432~~~
The movement is good but he lacks that little acceleration which allowed to reach balls before defenders, specially crosses.

6433~~~
The 43m doesnt bother me, based on his pedigree(and we've seen glimpses of that),I would pay the fee. He's born in the same year as Wayne Rooney remember. Its that damn wage packet which scares me off. If things dont work out,we would struggle to offload him. Something like 150k a week I would take, it would be hard to live with the nearly double that he is currently making. Wonder what Woody thinks.

6434~~~
So some with the exaggerating arguements about service, if Falcao can only perform with plenty of service, why not get a mediocre striker, I bet they'd both score sime out of it. He has to offer what RVP offered in his start, if we're concedering buying him, that was a world class striker, creating chances for himself, not many service but banging them in, great hold and link up play, some extra quality, not a poacher who needs the easiest chances to score and has zero use without world class service.

6435~~~
Being absolutely frank I haven't seen Falcao do very much that Chicharito could not. As of this minute I would question the wisdom on spending £43 million on him.

We need to rebuild our strike force. Van Persie is old, Rooney is not that much younger and besides them we only have Wilson and Chicharito (who is odds on to leave at the end of the season). If we were getting the Falcao of two years ago I would be all for it. However, at the moment he is not playing like his old self.

There are legitimate reasons why Falcao is struggling, service clearly has been a problem with United playing extremely risk averse football lately, but he's also snatching at chances. The composure and coolness in front of goal he has made his name for I don't see. At this minute if someone offered me a choice of Jackson Martinez or Falcao, right now I'd choose Martinez.

6436~~~
I think he's a great player with years of service to offer, the problem being is that if LvG doesn't know how to use him correctly, or get him firing under his 'philosophy', then it's pointless paying the stupid money to buy him.  
I thought his runs and off the ball were excellent yesterday but there is only so much you can do if you aren't getting a decent ball in.
Falcao is currently the least of our problems and we should be happy he is here for now.

6437~~~
Suarez is younger, coming after 2 great seasons, and never had long-term injury. Also his team doesn't   solely depend on him to score goals. 

Falcao is the opposite of all that.

6438~~~
Suarez is 28, Falcao is 28. Falcao's had more great seasons than Suarez has had. Falcao always plays with another striker, we don't depend on him solely - hell, I wish we did! I'd love to see him as a lone striker.

 Suarez has been so poor for Barcelona, anybody who's watched them will you tell that. Barca fans will you tell as such. And you should see some of the chances he's missed. It doesn't mean he's suddenly turned to shit. Falcao is playing in a fairly dysfunctional team, bereft of any sort of creativity behind him. The almost gleeful assumption that Falcao has lost it is tiresome. Unfortunately I don't think he'll ever get a fair chance of a consistent run in the team, so those shouting "Flop!" will be proved 'right' by default. 

<span style="font-size: 15px">Put him in a team where he's the main striker, has a working, creative midfield behind him and I'm certain we'll see a return to his former glory, or at least very close to it.

Don't know what's happened to the font.</span>

6439~~~
Stop being so sensible in on the forum. People always need someone to moan about despite the fact that we are playing absolute crap. For me once my striker gets in the right position and keeps hitting the target (a la Mr Cole) he's going to score goals.....

6440~~~
Touch of the Forlans about him.

He's working his balls off, but it's not working out, yet he retains a lot of popularity with the fans.

He'll leave, and bang them in somewhere else and we'll wonder why it didn't happen. 

Here's to two goals at Anfield before he leaves!

6441~~~
<b>Chances</b>

Falcao's had 20 inside the box in 12 hours; scoring 3.
Suarez's had 22 inside the box in 15 hours; scoring 2.

So actually Falcao's getting 3 good chances a match to Suarez's 2; not a case of blaming supply because he isn't scoring. Could be better supply of course, but it's better than a lot of strikers get.

<b>Creativity</b>

Falcao's created 10 chances; 3 of which were scored.
Suarez's created 28 chances; 7 of which were scored.

Suarez has been massively more creative and become a provider not the person being provided the chances. Di Maria (1 year younger than Suarez) was rated a £60m player for doing the very same.

6442~~~
Unfortunately that's a very apt comparison.

6443~~~
You need to watch a little closer if you think that. Falcao is always making runs and pulling players out of position, and he would have scored more IF and WHEN the balls were played to him properly. The trouble is the service he is (or isn't) getting. Admittedly he has been below par and his finishing needs to sharpen a little, but he has been feeding on scraps if anything at all. He got in to two or three goal scoring positions against Southampton only to see other players ignore his run and shoot themselves. RvP in particular could have slid a simple pass for a certain Falcao goal, but chose to shoot himself and miss.

Falcao would do much better playing alongside Rooney up front with Mata at 10 and he would definitely play much better if he was alone up front with fast wingers who could deliver accurate passes and crosses and a clever attacking midfielder like Mata or Rooney behind him controlling play and playing the ball forward to him so he's not always playing with his back to goal. Falcao (like most of our attacking players) is suffering from the system and slow build up play rather than being a completely spent force.

6444~~~
Stats or no stats, anybody can see Suarez has been poor. It's one of those things where you have to actually <i>watch</i> the matches, not just reel off numbers from Opta or wherever.

6445~~~
Chances in the box per 90 minutes

5 Aguero
3 Austin, Bony, Costa, Falcao, Pelle
2 Berahino, Ings, Kane, Sanchez

This not getting enough chances stuff is nonsense to cover for poor finishing.

6446~~~
Falcao's been visually poor too and it's visually that people think he's way past his best as much as anything. His touch looks wrong, his movement looks wrong (though less so) and his finishing is weak and being snatched at. Nobody's scared of him the way he's playing; not even League Two centre backs. Goalkeepers have time to react when he tries to beat them.

Suarez is playing a style of football he isn't used to and looking unsure of himself, not being the main focus of the team or allowed to get on the ball as much as he likes. Falcao's playing exactly the style of football he likes, if a slightly less quality version of it than Atletico produced, on the defender's shoulder, and missing chances.

6447~~~
If football statistics were a person, luckyspurs would need a restraining order.

6448~~~
Falcao's definitely been a bit of a let down, but this is a fantastic case of reading into, or using too much stats without any context, and particularly without watching either player much, this season.

Suarez, put into context of the season, the team, the chances, has definitely been <b>more</b> disappointing than Falcao. I don't even think any of our Barca posters would disagree with that.

The correct answer, as with most cases on this forum, is somewhat "in the middle".

Falcao's not been the same player he was (here's to hoping he gets back to that level, even if it is somewhere else) but he's also not been "shit". If you've been watching us play these past couple months, you would instantly realise that. Of course a striker like Aguero or Sanchez would make a difference to our forward line - it is not a secret that we are unbalanced and more importantly, lacking pace. Falcao, Rooney and RvP are essentially all 3 "too similar" IMO. & that's reason enough to not spend silly money on signing Falcao.

But our team atm, has issues all over the place. From formation, to form, to tactics, to balance. Our 1 major issue though, is that we're essentially not building our team around getting the best out of any 1 of our players and that's partly because the manager hasn't settled into his best XI yet either.

6449~~~
I'm not saying he's been great, I'm saying he hasn't suddenly turned to shit. And his inefficiency in front of goal has been compounded by a lack of adequate service. You can say he gets x chances per game, but I've watched every United game this season, and I can think of about 3 clear-cut chances Falcao missed but should have scored.

6450~~~
I can think of 3 in that Spurs match alone.

6451~~~
Every time I see luckyspurs as the last poster in a thread, I know it's going to be a list of fecking stats.

These stats imply that every chance in the box is exactly the same, from the exact same angle, with the exact same sight on goal. One chance in the box could be a one on one. Another could be from an angle infront of 3 defenders. It's meaningless to summarise them as all the same.

Bollocks to stats. Let's just watch the games and make a judgement from what actually happens, and not just a bunch of numbers.

6452~~~
He's had as much service as Costa, Pelle, Austin and Bony and more than Kane, Berahino, Ings and Sanchez. Only Aguero's getting more chances in the box per match. He's just missing the target too much and when it is on target it's got no power or placement on it.

Stop blaming attacking midfielders for the strikers (or at least the ones not scoring enough; Rooney's been fine and Van Persie alright) and the system for the attacking midfielders.

6453~~~
Apart from the ball Mata played into him, I can't think of another genuine clear-cut opportunity. RVP was more profligate against Spurs.

6454~~~
Would you mind running Rooney's and RVP's goals+assists per minute? I'd like to see how they match up to Falcao's. In my opinion, apart from a brief resurgence, RVP has been just as underwhelming as Falcao, especially considering the good faith shown by LVG.

Still, I struggle to blame the strikers fully. And that's because, as I say, I've watched every game we've played this season and invariably we create jack shit.

6455~~~
No it's not, I clearly said he needs to improve his finishing. Some has been unlucky and some has been completely awful. In the recent games he has played, United have been completely awful and created very little. It's no surprise to me that the whole teams creativity has dropped since Young has been injured. As we have seen since he has been missing we don't have anyone to drive forward and cross the ball or run at the defence and make passes forward as well as he was doing.

As for the "chances in the box" stats you posted, they don't really show the true story do they? All chances are different for one.

6456~~~
He's either still not fit or simply overrated. Rough to judge because I literally saw him play once before he joined. 

I'm not sure what kind of striker he is. He isn't overly fast, can't dribble, can't hold the ball up well, not very big and doesn't have great balance.

People speak of his brilliant finishing and movement but I expect those from any top level striker. 

He hasn't shown enough and up to this point I don't want him back. But I hope I'm wrong and he scores from here on out.

6457~~~

Saw about 3 against Everton, 2 against Spurs, a huge one against Hull, 3 or 4 against QPR and another couple against Cambridge. Can't even recall immediately the games in between. If this was Welbeck not Falcao in the penalty area nobody would be surprised or able to tell.

Watch loads of games; who that would spend any amount of time on here doesn't? It's how you form the original opinion (you don't argue something you haven't seen on the pitch and thought already). Then when pushed you can look up the evidence of what you've been seeing in matches (Falcao having loads of chances but missing them) and see if the evidence backs it up. If it does you can post it to strengthen and give weight to the opinion.

It's the type of thinking that stops swaying between players being great one week or rubbish the next. You have a little step back, look in context and try to get an overview of what level a player is and why it isn't working if that's the case. As someone with a history degree and within journalism, you're expected to provide evidence for your opinions and have to be able to respond when told you're talking nonsense when critiquing someone's favourite player.

So as well as being a really enjoyable site to be a part of, it's good practice defending your comments against critics or people trying to belittle or say you don't watch games, because you have an unpopular opinion. Every opinion is at one stage unrecognised or unpopular (loads remain unaccepted, but loads become accepted in time).

I'm a 24 year old football/sport mad Crystal Palace correspondent and sports writer. Of course I'm watching every match I possibly can, domestic and European, to form opinions on players and enjoy for their own sake.

6462~~~
Just out of curiosity, and I mean this is a major stab in the dark, but: How exactly do you know how many games I watch? Or do you go around generally in life making yourself out to be superior to others in whichever way you can find? So what if your a history post-grad, I majored in Finance and accounting, I don't go around telling people that I know the club's financial structure better than they will ever know? 

Jesus wept.

6463~~~
That's good, so you can research the last time Spurs actually won anything and then write about it to let the new generation of fans learn about it.

6464~~~
Needs repeating. Apparently.

6465~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6466~~~
He was world class before joining Monaco no doubt but began struggling there already before his injury as far as I can remember.

6467~~~
I see we have a new tedious statto. Fantastic.

6468~~~
Amazing

6469~~~
Very true, he wasn't great at Monaco, they are not an offensive that create a lot of opportunities but he could have done better. Emmanuel Rivière who plays for Newcastle was their main man and goalscorer even before Falcao got injured.

6470~~~
I think that he's been unlucky. He wants to sign for us but the problem is the price and the fact, we're playing like a pub team. So he's worried and that can effect anyone. Even in the last game, he had that one chance which I think was a good save. When your lucks in, it bounces in. People using stats or whatever - it's clear as day. If you're a forward for United at the minute, there is a real lack of quality service coming your way and when it does, it's so inconsistent that you cannot be expecting it. (from midfield and from out wide)

So when it comes to judging Falcao it's very difficult. He had no pre season. Two of his goals have come to rescue us a point so that will often get overlooked. It must be disheartening relying on some of these players to earn a contract. We saw with Tevez that if the situations not quite right - in that he knew he wasn't first choice etc players can struggle and he struggled.

He wasn't the same player at City. With Better service and a real belief in this team AND if we sign him..I think he'd be a far better taker of chances.

6471~~~
Don't know why I felt the need to defend myself slightly. Might have had something to do with 6 posters, including yourself, pointing, laughing, posting smilies and generally trying to belittle at every turn and reduce a poster not a post, for saying Falcao's has had plenty of chances and hasn't taken them well enough.

Also, as you would see if you read the edited quote, the comment was to say that a history grad uses evidence (I didn't watch the Battle of Hastings for example) to make arguments and a journalist (criticising Harry Redknapp for instance) has to defend that argument using evidence, or they are accused of having an agenda or hating for no reason.

It wasn't the case of trying to act superior that you took it to mean. Probably says more about you than me; racing in to announce your Finance and accounting major at the very mention of my uni past (it was reference to the subject not the degree). Last bit of this playground nonsense. Back to the debate.

6472~~~
Fair enough to you fella, you seem a smart chap and you do back up your points well. I was merely referring to the fact that you strongly use stats to back up your point, just more than the average poster does. I'm not one to criticize the poster, more an observation I have made more than anything else.

Keep the facts going though, I do learn something new every day <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6473~~~
The comparisons to Suarez are a bit silly. Suarez is coming off  a couple of world class seasons. Falcao is coming off an average one and a serious injury.

6474~~~
I made a joke about your team and wasn't ridiculing you personally. Can we not laugh and joke while having a discussion?

6475~~~
Berbatov's doing well for them too and he's been too old for United for ages. I know Berbatov's never been quick and more suited to French or Italian football, but it's interesting. Monaco was pre-injury too. Shame because he's a really nice guy of course and clearly willing to work. Riviere to be honest felt like a Kane style run than something long term; even before his Newcastle move.

6476~~~
Luckyspurs is mad winger without the Kagawa. He was an opta man too.

6477~~~
What's silly? Suarez is having a hard time of it in Spain. Falcao's injury came during his only season at Monaco and he also had a good 3/4 world class seasons before it. He only returned to full fitness recently. If he doesn't make it here he probably will somewhere else. Those stats are stupid. It's clear as fecking day that Costa etc get better service than Falcao.

6478~~~
<a class="username" data-user="93464, @luckyspurs" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/93464/">@luckyspurs</a> 

'Shots in the box' doesn't have to equal clear cut chances. In a fast, counter attacking team it normally would, but United's build up play is so slow that a lot of those shots could be speculative attempts with five defenders between Falcao and the goal. You can't make comparisons of finishing ability by % of shots converted without allowing all sorts of differences between the sort of supply players are getting. Giroud's % of shots converted is probably really high this season, but he's not a great finisher at all, he positions himself well for cut backs from the wings, and has scored a couple from outside the box but he's terrible at finishing when one on one with a keeper. 

Stats are only ever useful if you look at them in context. If everyone but you disagrees with the way the stats have been used to make an argument, the argument's probably wrong.

6479~~~
Maybe there really was something to those age rumours. I mean, it'd tie in with his regression (pre injury) at Monaco. The fact that he got so badly injured just made matters worse. But he was hardly ripping up any trees in France before that.

6480~~~
Agree with the general point to a degree, but for a few different reasons. Firstly, a lot of Falcao's chances (this is just from watching) are headers whipped in that he can't help head over the bar because he's got a defender pressed all over him (more allowed in English football). That counts as chance in the box, but as you say it's not as good as Hazard and Fabregas drawing defenders to them and feeding Costa in space.

Falcao has had plenty of the same types of chances Giroud and Costa have been getting though and struggled. Everton he completely scuffed a great chance and the two against Spurs were the two worst I've seen from him, besides the Hull one cleared off the line. Part of that's luck (Balotelli could have had 5 or 6, the way De Gea and McGregor and a few other keepers played against him) but his shot power looks down and he's not moving his limbs the way he did for Atletico (agility I suppose you'd call it).

Falcao used to have that Aguero look in the sense that the ball could come to him at almost any height or pace and he'd react to power or deflect it in the net somehow. Just not catching them the same way; looks achy if that makes sense. Like a retired kick boxer or kung fu movie star who can't do the body movements which made him so special.

has had chances and has not taken them. has three goals two tap ins and a header. we'd be flogging him big style if his name was javier hernandez. difference is that we're paying more for his 1 season loan than we paid for hernandez.

6482~~~
If his name was Hernandez or Welbeck he'd be getting absolutely destroyed on here. And I mean slaughtered.

6483~~~
You can bag falcao all you like but any striker in the world would look dog shit in this drivel of a formation van gaals serving up . I'd go as far to say we are the worst team to watch in the league .
Agreed falcao as been poor but so as rvp and wilsons not exactly broke any pots . If van gaal can't put a decent attack minded formation together with the players he as available then he's the wrong man for the job .

6484~~~
So a flick of a switch then turned him from world class to average overnight then did it?  His record there wasn't even that bad. 13 in 22. Lets forget about the 150 goals in 180 games before that. He may not reach those levels again but it's feck all to do with his age.

6485~~~
Yep, so many people wanted Welbeck to leave in the summer didn't they? Some are still probably whinging about it.

Also, from the past few pages It seems as though a lot of people are "slaughtering" Falcao so to speak.

6486~~~
used hernandez because he "only scores" tag associated with his name as if that's a bad thing for a poacher (which falcao is now).

6487~~~
It didn't happen overnight though. He had an average season in a pretty poor French league. 13 in 22 (and quite a few were penalties) really isn't impressive for a player of his caliber, in a league of that standard. 

Yep.

6488~~~
He seems like a nice guy and he looks to be enjoying the time here, but every passing day is more clearer that he is more trouble than he is worth.

Basically:

- he is on high wages 
- he requires high fee at the end of the season 
- his age is not the best to build around him 
- we already have a similar player
- to fit him in the team we must drop one of our other top attacking players and play Rooney out of position
- if he is not played you have half the press, his buddies and his agent spitting shit all over the newspapers how LVG hates him and he would be a the second coming of Christ at any other club
- makes the caftards want to kill each other

So, unless he finds his feet and gets back to his best, he is not really worth it. I would say even at a smaller fee we'll be better off buying somebody younger with bags of potential than him.

6489~~~
That's half a season of football you are judging him for when half a decade before that he was smashing them in for any club he was at. Maybe it had something to do with his lack of motivation to play for a club with no fanbase in a move obviously engineered by people other than himself. Seems like he couldn't wait to get away from there.

I do agree however that we shouldn't sign him permanently unless his fortunes do change dramatically. Still believe he can turn it around.

6490~~~
It's a false antithesis, as he keeps pointing out rather immodestly. 

Unless it's used in a slanted, and/or facile way, I definitely prefer a quantitative approach to analysis. This because it's at least falsifiable, whereas 'just watch and make up your mind' spiel is just an excuse for people to post any old assertive bollocks, without ever being wrong.

6491~~~
Rivière has always been an ok to average player since his Saint-Étienne days, just saying that Falcao wasn't even Monaco's best striker last season. I remember they had a system with Falcao up top alone but over the course of the season they switched to a 2 man attack because Rivière was efficient and there was no way Falcao was going to get benched. Berbatov is doing well indeed but without scoring a high number of goals, he's enjoying the life over there and his football shows.

6492~~~
Good post and I agree, he does look off and has definitely lost the wow factor and the feel of a goal when he gets the ball. Hopefully that will come back.

No apologies needed. But thanks anyway. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6493~~~
I feel bad for him, he's being strangled in this team. He'll go somewhere else and bang in 40 goals a season and people will say he was crap for us, while ignoring that this team would struggle to create chances against a team full of M&S mannequins.

6494~~~
He has not been good enough so far, the reason for that is up to debate.

6495~~~
he's part of the problem , zero pace. 2nd point - he may go to italy but the days of him turning a defender of quality and taking him on are over. age and injury have done him in. and he won't be going for 40m either. monaco will be lucky to get half that.

6496~~~
Can't disagree with that.

6497~~~
A busted flush? That's absolutely ridiculous. Players have come back from much bigger injuries before. A busted acl is not the end of the world anymore. I know, I've had it done. 

He has not been receiving adequate service. He'd need to be ten foot tall to reach most of the crosses that we put in. There's no point in Januzaj whipping the ball to the near post when Falcao is at the back post and vice versa. The service he has been given in general has been absolutely shocking. 

He will inevitably leave at the end of the season. We won't play to his strengths so we won't get the best of him. He will go somewhere else and clean up, just like he always has. 

A busted flush? That's laughable.

6498~~~
I don't think Chicharito or Welbeck ever received this much criticism just 5 months into their careers at United.

Their criticism arose after a good couple of seasons of being poor. 

That comparison doesn't correlate here.

6499~~~
Look at the highest scorers over the last five/six seasons or so in Ligue 1 though. Zlatan aside (because he makes supposedly poor leagues his bitch), people don't score that highly.

6500~~~
Why was Welbeck not afforded the excuse of 'the service is shit' considering it was apparently shit  last season too.

6501~~~
I have been watching closely and I am not just pretending it's all fine and someone else's fault, the guy is a spent force as a top class player. I'm not talking about having some decent movement I am talking having the ability to stretch defenders, draw them out of position (a lot of the time he can't get on the end of passes because he is so slow).

He is basically a very expensive Hernandez,  more intelligent movement and probably a better finisher but a lot less pace. Set the whole team up a round him and he would be better but most players would and given his age and current ability it makes no sense to build an attack round him.

To be fair all this debate is pretty pointless because there is no way he will be here next season, whether it's falcao or LVG people want to blame it doesn't disguise the fact he has been huge flop and is not the player he was.

6502~~~
well there was a good reason for hernandez not to get criticized , he scored goals. when healthy and playing regularly he was a 20 goal striker for the club.

6503~~~
Because Wellbeck was already shit before the service itself was shit. Also, he never had even an average goalscoring season at United.

6504~~~
He scored 20 goals in all competitions once.

6505~~~
The one season he started regularly? Hernandez deserved little to no criticism for the most part of his time at United. For where we got him from and the price we paid he was a great signing. We're nowhere near being able to say that about Falcao.

6506~~~
And scored 18 goals in 12/13 when he was behind Rooney and RvP in the pecking order and had to contend with Welbeck and Kagawa at times for a spot. Under Fergie nobody could have any complaints about him really. Under Moyes he hardly got a chance other then 5 or 10 minute sub appearances.

6507~~~

Have you even watched us play over the last few months?

6508~~~
Because <b>D</b>at Guy Welbz has never improved and has been average throughout his career.

6509~~~
What season was this then?

You know it doesn't count if there was great service to the strikers at United but he was playing for a different club?

6510~~~
I hate to agree with Alan Shearer, but he made a good point in the Cambridge game. There were a few occasions where Falcao made great runs and the wide players checked back instead of whipping the ball in. Blind's cut back and shot in the early part of the game being a prime example.

6511~~~
Or Valencia's crazy spin (even if Falcao wasn't running towards the goal, he made himself available for a pass). There is too much hesitancy and not enough risk taking with the passing.

6512~~~
He's not done a lot wrong, and he definitely needs more support... just not sure he is the type of striker we need though. Rooney is the only one we have who can make his own chances.

6513~~~
There were also times when a player put a cross in and he wasn't expecting it. Particularly Januzaj late on in the second half. Falcao was near the penalty spot for that beautiful whipped cross he put right along the edge of the 6 yard line.

6514~~~
He is a striker that isn't scoring goals, we cannot afford to commit that much of our transfer budget to him. He might come good next season, but he might not and I would rather sign someone who is a bit more of a certainty and yes he is a lovely guy, but that isn't enough unless he starts banging the goals in.

6515~~~
Been a theme this season. Great balls whipped across the box which he's not getting on the end of. He looks like he's lost a yard of pace and that yard is everything when it comes to goal-poaching in the box.

I think/hope it's all to do with fitness and he'll look sharper and sharper the more games he plays but it's missing the point to simply blame others for his issues in front of goal.

6516~~~
yep and 18 another - pedantic but you're right. point still stands that he scored when he played. an ideal poacher. 6m to own not to loan. left his ego at the door and played his arse off for united.

6517~~~
True, although you could argue that after making x amount of runs for nothing, he anticipated that the ball was more likely to be held up and then whipped towards the penalty spot so he placed himself there?

6518~~~
It's easy to blame our strikers but they do rely on service. Something they've not had a lot of in recent weeks.

I guess the problem is he's missed some easy chances, but I still think he's looked our most dangerous striker.

6519~~~
Looking at the majority of Ronaldo's goals this season, it's all about service service service. Great crosses to head in, nice easy cutbacks or throughballs from the likes of Ghames, Bale and the rest of the star ensembles... I doubt he would do much better than Falcao in the style we play.

6520~~~
I think we all know what this guy was capable off and that his current season is pretty much disappointing in regards to his potential. The true question is though if he is going to recover to his best or doing a Torres.

Atm I feel the only situation under which we should gamble on how he truns out is if we get him way cheaper from Monaco and he takes a wage cut but making a player who's future development is more than uncertain and who hasn't impressed for a huge transfer fee and the highest wages at the club seems to much of a risk to me, especially given the fact that we already have 1 1/2 great strikers of similar age already.

6521~~~
Why go there in the 1st place? Surely shows he is just looking for a payday, and there lies the problem - he has completely lost his hunger.

6522~~~
Not so much Bale assisting this season (he's mainly been grabbing and creating his own goals), but James, Isco, Benzema and Kroos have been doing a lot of that. Bale last season gave Ronaldo tonnes of one on ones with the keeper. 

Also worth remembering Ronaldo has 12 assists of his own (3 less than Fabregas). He might sulk when he hasn't scored but he still passes when it's on quite often. All-around, Ronaldo's just a much better player and able to make his own space.

6523~~~
That was all Mendes' fault and had <i>nothing</i> to do Falcao at all...

That's why no-one ever mentions it <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

6524~~~
Mercenaries going to merce, I suppose. 

He gets away with it as he does come across as a nice guy, but deep down he just loves the cash <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

6525~~~
Sign Berahino and save all that money we were willing to waste to bring him in. Just don't see him ever being the player he used to be plus we'd be preparing for the future.

6526~~~
I don't want to seem like a hater,  considering all the other strikers have been the same as well,  but I hope we don't buy him. 

We already had problems with an unbalanced squad,  and Falco is just making it worse.

6527~~~
So after reading through the past 3-5 pages of this thread I think we can all agree on two matters concerning Falcao and his current form:

1. Our main strikers, Falcao and RVP, (not including Rooney because he has frustratingly been played in midfield more than being used at his actual position, and he's also a type of player that can create for himself) are types of strikers that do not create their own chances very often. Falcao and RVP rely heavily on good, consistent service into and around the box. That said, I think we can acknowledge that the forward passes and service into the box this season has been subpar and frankly not good enough. Falcao is a player that can be incredibly deadly when the ball is played into dangerous positions. Again, we know this - he's a class poacher.

2. However it is clear that Falcao's form and potent poaching ability has looked like a shadow of it's former self this season compared to his Porto, Atletico and (partially) Monaco days. Many believe this is due to his terrible knee injury and that because of this he will never be the deadly striker he used to be. Others believe - myself included - that he simply has not had enough chances (minutes) in games to really get his fitness to a top level.

Regardless, I think the problems Falcao is facing have to do with the crap service from our midfield and also his fitness levels. Though on a final point, playing with two strikers given our general lack of creativity from midfield is also hampering Falcao's ability to get legitimate scoring opportunities - in my opinion. But that sort of argument brings up the discussion having to do with balance in the team and which players you would need to drop, etc.

Thoughts?

6528~~~
As a Spurs fan, maybe it's memories of Defoe putting me off, but I wouldn't want Berahino for anything more than £15m and even then I'd have to talk myself into it. Don't think people realise quite how limited he is general play at the moment (love his picking corners out one on one with keepers though). Reminds me of Hernandez so much.

6529~~~
You guys discussing the Monaco transfer? Falcao's ownership was a bit shady when he was at Atletico and he was basically sold without his consent to Monaco. You could actually tell when he was holding up his shirt at his unveiling he had no idea where the feck he was. He definitely wanted to get out of there asap. 

He probably loves the cash (who doesn't), but I don't think he's a real mercenary in the common sense of it.

6530~~~
Watching him and RVP make the same runs and colliding with each other was fecking hilarious, what's the actual point of playing them together when they offer pretty much the same qualities? Falcao also moves like he's carrying 100 extra kg weight on his boots lol.

We need to play him as the lone striker or with Rooney and Rooney only, or we shouldn't play him at all.

6531~~~
I don't think we'll know for sure, even at the end of the season, but regardless of the reason for his lack of productivity, there's no reason to turn his loan into a permanent a deal and invest a lot of money into a player with an unknown output. The transfer fee that is being discussed is only justified when you can be relatively sure that the player is going to produce. Hell, di Maria was one of Real's, the reigning UCL winners, best players last year and did well for Argentina at the World Cup but even he hasn't justified his transfer fee yet.

He might have a good game here and there during the rest of the season, but overall it's just not been enough to buy him. I'd rather go after a younger, most likely cheaper striker.

6532~~~
Can a player even be transferred without consent, surely he could have said no. He is a global superstar not some naive 18 year old kid looking for his for break into Europe.

He went to Monaco, purely for a payday, the only reason he is with us is because Real said no.

6533~~~
Almost seems like he has Platiniophobia, fear of being in the  champions league. Hasnt he always  left a club just as they get into the CL and joined one that isnt?

6534~~~
I disagree with the first bolded section. Both players have been known for creating their own chances. Sure, they do good runs and if given the pass they want they will more times than not put it away. However, though they may not be the Suarez/Augero type dribbling goal scorers, they can turn any slight advantage into a big advantage. Falcao is also more of a goal creator than RVP, evidenced by his passes to RVP and Rooney which led to goals. He knows where a striker should be and plays it into that space.

The second bold section I think is the story of our season. Very few of the old squad seem capable or willing to make a creative pass. It appears that maybe Scholes, Giggs, Carrick and Rooney were carrying a lot of players over the last 2-3 years. Carrick seems to have lost the will to make those passes that cut open defenses, Rooney always looking to the wings. If we can get the likes of Di Maria, Mata and Herrera on the field playing in preferred positions, we may see better service. However, we need the likes of Jones, Evans and Smalling to understand we have a midfield, so the answer isn't always sideways or hoof.

6535~~~
Good points all around - particularly your second paragraph. I just remember how amazing and important Carrick was to the team 2 seasons back. The amount of balls he launched up to RVP game after game just made opposing teams unravel. But it's baffling to try and understand where those types of plays have gone. I do agree that the ball-playing ability of our back four (3?) is not where it needs to be. As we all know van Gaal likes his teams to plau football that concentrates building from the back, yet that's a bit hard when your defenders aren't even capable of passing it 10 yards directly in front of them - only to the ever-dangerous Antonio Valencia on the wings or completely over the heads of the strikers by hoofing it long.

At the moment, I think Di Maria and Herrera are the only 2 players with the ability and knack for finding the likes of Falcao and RVP in forward positions. Although, we have one of them being played completely out of his natural position and the other is thrown to the bench for god knows why. You would imagine (hope) that once we get more quality in the defense and also bring in a box-to-box type midfielder we'll start to see the final product that we all think van Gaal is trying to get to (4-3-3).

6536~~~
I actually feel sorry for him with that. I think it's just bad guidance from his agent in all honesty - that and his injury.

And although I'm completely against us signing him, I do really, genuinely hope for the best for him and I do feel for him.

I think (as I've said repeatedly in this thread) that Italy is the best place for him. Somewhere that he can be forgiven for that half a yard of pace he's clearly lost and somewhere not quite as frenetic and physical as the Premier League.

I basically think he's turned up at pretty much the worse place for him and he should move on to a league that suits his current skill set asap. Hopefully his advisors are empathetic enough to see the same and he isn't shoehorned into another badly thought out move in order to line Mendes' pockets - which I think is certainly the case with his last two moves.

6537~~~
My 5 year old daughter had a little tea party at the weekend for the dog and a couple of her dolls. One of the (imaginary) attendees was a chap called Radamel.

6538~~~
I've been waiting and waiting for him to find some kind of form that made him so lethal in the past but it's never happened. Something special has got to happen in the games we have left for him to prove his massive price tag. Harsh but it's reality.

6539~~~
What makes you think his general play is limited? he's no more limited than a Falcao and has some of the best ball striking technique you're likely to see fom youngsters.

6540~~~
From what I read and understood, it wasn't as simple as that and the the answer to the bolded part is that basically because of the third party ownership his own choices were limited.

6541~~~
I find it a little strange that we set up to play slow patient possession football and decide that falcao is our striker we want to sign to make it work.

6542~~~
What does that have to do with it? He can be a beast in the box because of his movement and anticipation. No matter if we play qick or slow until then.

I didn't get why we signed him anyways, but yeah.

6543~~~
I hope she had the foresight not to invite the imaginary Jorge Mendes. It could get messy if her dolls decide they want representation.

Next thing you know, Bebe will show up.

6544~~~
all this talk of lack of service for him is moot because we've had strikers score goals with the same service or lack there of. RVN scored boat loads with shit around him for most of his time here. rooney , RVP and hernandez scored , welzb had chances as well.

6545~~~
It's nonsense. The service isn't great, and your strikers clearly aren't your only problem, but people are letting Falcao off the hook too easily. The fact is he's had plenty of decent chances that he would have put away at Atlético, and it's pretty obvious that he's lost a lot of his mobility which is crucial for his game.

6546~~~
it's not just that - look at sterling , loads of chances but can't finish well , there's more to it. falcao can't make his own chances anymore or at least not now.

6547~~~
He just needs luck on his side. Could easily have scored against Cambridge but instead of the ball dipping under the post it went over. On another day that would have just dropped into the net. 

The Spurs game was the only match I thought "wow he doesn't seem right" but I can excuse that for playing 2 games in 2 days practically. Silly by LVG to play him that quickly.

6548~~~
Sterling is a skilful winger/a creative wide man, forced to play as a striker as his team hasn't got any. He's also just turned 20 years old. Falcao is apparently one of the best #9s in the world, as shown by the huge fee we paid both on wages and on the loan to bring him here. It's not a question of luck, or match fitness, or service, he's just nowhere near as good as he once was.

6549~~~
sterlings best games and liverpool's run of good results last season had him playing a lot through the middle - he pushed cb's back towards their own goals

6550~~~
That's true but he played behind Sturridge and Suárez as part of a diamond back then. He pushed forward but started deep (though I'm not sure what relevance that has...he could have good games even with his finishing letting him down but I'm not sure Falcao can).

6551~~~
i don't think sterling's a winger. he has pace but clearly better at playing through the middle of the park. and he will be asked to score goals from that position. and falcao must start to convert the chances he's had.

6552~~~
A lot of the chances Sterling manages are through his own doing also - you only have to look at the game against Chelsea in the Capital One cup. But this is all irrelevant, people are now comparing young talents who naturally play   different positions just to compensate how average Falcao has been. Come on, now.

6553~~~
he will score goals like that one. that will be his , if you will , signature goal. pace and catching the keeper off his mark.

6554~~~
Any change he will start on saturday?

6555~~~
I'm not a huge Berahino fan but I think you've been a little harsh on him. He's played as a second striker, lone front man and out wide on quite a few occasions. Certainly not as limited as Defoe. Saying that, I agree that he wouldn't be worth it for any more than £15m

6556~~~
Do we think he'll get another start this weekend? Or will LVG revert to RVP? Or both.

Or will Wilson replace one of them. Either way you would expect this is as a good a chance any of them have to get a goal in the prem.

6557~~~
He's truly very different from Hernandez. He's strong for a small player with good holdup play. The problem with Berahinho is that he's not been scoring so much lately and has barely any away goals. His general play is more than fine

6558~~~
Can see him being on the bench for this. Rooney and RVP upfront with Mata behind.

6559~~~
He should be dropped based on his recent performances, should try Rooney up front with Mata in behind and then the diamond in midfield but it will probably be RVP and Falcao up front again.

6560~~~
It's not a moot point because anyone watching will know we used to create FAR more chances. In addition to that, in seasons gone past we had a settled system. We had a confident backline and if not a great midfielder a decent winger.

6561~~~
If we're signing for the future then we need to get lacazette

6562~~~
Cambridge United game summed it up for me. I really wanted him to succeed and be massive hit in the premier league and rival the golden boot but he just cant get a run of form. I'd still like him in the team but for 50 million is just not what he is performing out there, regardless the fact that the team is still in transition and playing poor. A player with that price tag should be getting the man of the match and scoring goals what he created himself and doesnt need players around him making him look good. RVP did that when he came to united, overall team performance was poor but RVP swoops in and manages to score goals from out of nowhere and united got him for about 22.5 million AND united won the premier league title because of that guys consistency of scoring goals.

Falcao is no way worth 50 million. If the shape of the team or the players he's surrounded with is effecting how he plays then in no way he is worth 50 million. I expect players who are worth even 30m to put a man of the match performance regardless of what team, what formation or what style of football they play. whereas 50 million, he has to be a super star among those like Neymar & Bale, sadly he's not showing that.

6563~~~
How many goals does he have to score in order for him to be signed?

6564~~~
He is Ruud Van Nistelrooy reincarnated. The resemblance in play style is quite eerie.

Both have a knack for scoring goals even when not playing particularly well. Similar styles of holding up the ball too.

6565~~~
He hasn't been spectacular in any way but he looks much sharper today. Controls the ball better in tight areas and looks bright and alive. Some decent passing as well. He needs to show much more if we're to buy him and today is a step in the right direction.

6566~~~
Good game today, good movement, better touch and showed his strength.

Most importantly, got his goal.

6567~~~
Got his goal today which is good for his confidence I suppose but didn't do much else. Hopefully he builds on from here.

6568~~~
Really? Thought he got involved in a lot of the build ups today, nice little touches out wide and always moving inside the box. Did well today.

6569~~~
I suppose but didn't do much with the ball though. RVP had less of the ball but was more effective for instance.

6570~~~
same , scrappy goal , but he at least kept the ball and used it.

6571~~~
So Rvp was excellent in your opinion, but all Falcao done was get a goal?

Take your blinkers off man, has Falcao chopped off your nob and that's why you hate him so much?

6572~~~
Again, really? Falcao had several very good chances on goal with the ball played into him, but all of them were too heavy and meant that Falcao had to turn back and slow the play down. Had those balls been weighted better he would have been on goal a lot this game.

6573~~~
Decent game. Again cannot fault his commitment

Still seems crazy to think we will pay over 40mill for him though

6574~~~
Very good today imo

6575~~~
He would have scored more if passes from Di Maria, Rooney and I think Adnan were more precise. Simple passes were playing him out wide.

6576~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The feck are you talking about?

Yes, RVP was better, quite clearly so. Maybe you should stop spending so much time up his arse though? I didn't even criticize him and yet here you are with your knickers in a twist.

6577~~~
Thought he did very well today. Not worth signing yet, but if he keeps "developing" in this direction...who knows....maybe we get the Falcao from 3-4 seasons ago <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6578~~~
He held the ball up well and battled but no way we should be splashing the cash for him. He looks like he's running in quick sand. Him vs Fellani would be a decent race to watch.

6579~~~
He was better today than he has been in his last couple of games.

6580~~~
Seems to need the ball laid on a plate in order to score thesedays.

Otherwise pretty decent. Very strong on the ball.

6581~~~
Could have scored more and could have been given better service. Its one area we have been relatively poor this year. But can you blame the players? They are playing in different formations all year long. Its hard to build up an understanding when all your teammates are either injured or playing out of position. Falcao has shown he can score goals and will continue to do so as long as we stay away from the 3 at the back shite.

6582~~~
RVP took his goal well but didn't do much more than Falcao, infact RVP missed a very good chance where he had a clear shot on goal but fluffed the volley and ballooned it, if that was Falcao he would be getting slaughtered right now.

6583~~~
Great to see him score today. But it was against pure fodder.

Needs a genuinely brilliant 2nd half of the season before we should even be considering signing him - hopefully this was the start of it, but lets wait and see how he does over the next 10 games before getting away.

6584~~~
Agreed, I haven't yet seen him score a typical Falcao goal that I remember when I think of him, the closest to it was vs Everton, the rest have been scrappy, and a header.

Was a lot better today overall though.

6585~~~
How was RVP better?

This will be fun.

6586~~~
Hopefully he'll start playing as well as that guy you were comparing him to

6587~~~
If that was a clear chance at goal then I'd love to know what you think of Falcao's misses this season. No doubt he was unlucky

6588~~~
Yup, no doubt. If he didn't score today, this thread would have been on page 170 already.

6589~~~
Why are you changing the subject and deflecting the blame? It's a fair point, he should have atleast hit the target.

6590~~~
Thought he was very good today personally.

6591~~~
Looked much better today, involved a lot more and didn't look like he was running through quicksand half the time.

He does seem to get dragged out wide quite a fair bit. Actually, it happened for other players today. Final ball needs improvement.

6592~~~
Better touch, a finish that wasn't a tap in.

6593~~~
Falcao has the higher rating for today's game from caf voters so it can't be that clear.

6594~~~
RVP had 94% pass accuracy, losing the ball just once (tackled), 1 key pass and won 2 fouls with his back to goal and defenders holding onto him. Its very silly that some (a lot) of fans cant appreciate the role he has to play to allow others space and bring them into play.

Falcao on the other hand lost the ball 5 times and was responsible for all 3 of our offsides. He was fine but you have a screw loose if you think he was close to RVP today.

6595~~~
You called it a "very good chance" which is of course complete bollocks. It was a very touch chance. The only one showing double standards is you I'm afraid considering how you defended Falcao for missing absolute sitters.

6596~~~
Think Caffers are more likely to bias vote with Falcao. It was a toss up between Blind and Rojo who was actually the best.

6597~~~
hey are both excellent strikers and given the opportunity they will link up well. I still cry out for better service for both of them through the centre rather than the wings.

6598~~~
New toy syndrome. You'd have to be blind (no not him) to think Falcao was better today.

6599~~~
Blind by a mile. Superb performance.

6600~~~
Good game, nothing too spectacular but a nice (scrapy) finish. Onwards and upwards!

6601~~~
I thought he was better. Fantastic half volley with his weak foot, very good in the build up to the second goal as well. Put Falcao through will a nice pass before that also. Didn't see the ball as much in the second half but his hold up play was fine and he's still making intelligent runs. Falcao was good, did the right thing for his goal by changing his run and being in the right place to finish, I just thought van Persie was better.

6602~~~
So everyone is biased and blind except for you. Ok. Got it.

6603~~~
That's incorrect, never did , look back in the thread, always criticised him for missing chances, although i have been defending his overall performances which people have been going OTT on how bad he's been.

6604~~~
That moment in the second half where Rooney played it across goal was typical of Falcao so far. It was about a yard or so over hit, but still quite gettable. The likes of Aguero, Costa, Benzema, Rooney himself etc etc would have gobbled that chance up. But Falcao just couldn't move his body in time and instead was left chasing after the ball and turning back. He just hasn't got that initial yard of pace anymore, thats so vital at the top level.

6605~~~
His first touch was much better today, all round his best performance for a while.

6606~~~
Did well overall today... Still hope we don't sign him though. Not what we need longterm, which is essentially what he's playing for.

6607~~~
I agree (unless we could negotiate the fee down).

6608~~~
Even then, I have nothing against him but having him in the squad does more harm then good I think. It forces Rooney back into midfield, forcing mata or Herrera on the bench. And IMO we'd just be better having Rooney in his proper position and Herrera in midfield. Much better. That's the problem that falcao has, even if he does okay, we will still probably look better as a team with him on the bench and others moved around in their proper positions.

6609~~~
He's doing decent but after giving him the benefit of the doubt, I don't think he is going to cut it long term. The team could really do with a livewire, dribbling striker up front in the mould of a Costa/Suarez/Aguero. Instead of constant passing back and layoffs which slow down the attack, we'd have someone who gets the ball, twists and turns.. and turns defence into attack in an instant.

None of the forwards we have do that.. Danny was the only one, shame he was crap at scoring goals and anything but a livewire in the final third - even if we put rooney up top, we'd still have this issue. I'd love a 06 Saha playing up top for this side.

6610~~~
Got his goal, but I thought his overall play was so much better today. Held it up well, brought others into play, good first touch, passing, etc. Good performance from him today, and his goal can only give him more confidence going into the next game.

6611~~~
Good game today. Best he's played in weeks. But I agree with whoever above suggested that we could well need a different kind of striker, one in the mould of Aguero or Suarez.

6612~~~
Yup they really mucked up easy passes to give him a clear opportunity.

6613~~~
Its confidence, it will come.

6614~~~
Or Bale <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

6615~~~
Nonsense, as long as movement is good then its not essential. We've had 3 wonderful strikers at the club in recent years that go completely against that theory.

6616~~~
I agree that we need a striker like that but I also think that is in addition to Falcao. When you factor in that we don't know how much longer RVP will be here and Rooney playing in midfield then I think we need both a quick striker and a Falcao.

6617~~~
Very good chance? It would've been a stunner if he'd volleyed that in.

6618~~~
I like his hardwork he could come in handy if we provide some balls for him. Him and Wilson could be a great duo

6619~~~
Who?

6620~~~
Exactly this.

Falcao works hard but he's not the long-term answer for us.

6621~~~
Teddy, RVN, Ole.

6622~~~
Was really impressed with his play farther up the pitch.  Looked way too limited in past games, perhaps because of fitness.

6623~~~
Aye, me too. RVP was excellent too, and they seemed to enjoy playing together.

6624~~~
RVN was probably one of the sharpest strikers ever seen. He'd turn situations that weren't even chances into goals just with his movement and reactions. Ole's reactions and movement were pretty damn quick too. Neither were the quickest over a distance, but both certainly had that initial burst of speed needed in the area

Teddy I'll give you, but he was a completely different kind of striker to others, and wasn't exactly a prolific goalscorer either.

6625~~~
You can't convince me Ole and RVN were quick off the spot, they were intelligent players who could read the game and possessed great movement. Once Falcao gets his confidence back he'll be a huge asset.

6626~~~
Better today but still don't see any signs he is anywhere near the player he was or any reason why he should be here next season. That yard of pace he has lost makes all the difference and without it he just can't quite get on the end of chances he would have been finishing off when in his prime.

6627~~~
They were both very sharp in the area, RVP especially. Falcao always looks like he's a yard behind everyone else atm.

6628~~~
No one else would pay anything close to the asking price at his age and after the season he's had so far. It would be ridiculous if we did.

6629~~~
good to see him getting a goal, even if it was a scrappy one. nice movements and decent at holding the ball too, shows a lot of power and strength. 

however, kind of agree with some posters that he still looks a yard or two off.

6630~~~
Nothing to do with him but lets be honest, everything is being played in front of the strikers, when the through ball was played, often they were over hit. In any SAF team, he'd be filling now.....

6631~~~
Whatever happened to that dyBala guy we were linked with? He would be great for us and I also think he would bring the best out of di Maria because he is fast and skillful

6632~~~
Decent game today.

My problem is this: What is it that he has provided in a United shirt (or Monaco shirt for that matter) that warrants us forking out north of £25 million to buy him - let alone the £35 mill or £40 mill being bandied about?

Or to put it harshly: What is it that he provides that say Rickie Lambert wouldn't? Which is quite a scary thought.

6633~~~
I don't think Rooney will move back up front regardless of Falcao being here or not and that's really fecking annoying.

6634~~~
Comparing Falcao to Lambert is a bit ridiculous to be honest.

It absolutely baffles me why seemingly some of our own fans want him to fail when he gives his all to the club but were loyal to the end to Carlos Tevez for example. 

I would rather we kept him, but re-negotiated the price first

6635~~~
13 in 22 for Monaco is hardly shit considering his injuries and general rust.

6636~~~
That's the thing. I desperately want him to succeed. He just looks right in a United shirt, he's putting in the effort.

But he just doesn't have the quality any more, as far as I can see.

I'll say it again: What things has he done in a United shirt that's more than an average PL striker could do? Forget about Lambert, why not compare him to someone like Harry Kane? At the moment he's falling way short and I sure as hell wouldn't pay £30 million for Kane either, even though he's significantly younger.

6637~~~
Why was Falcao branded world class when his goal record wasn't much different than Negredo and Soldado? Fair amount were penalties too.

I didn't follow Atletico with Falcao much. Interested to know people's opinions.

6638~~~
He was excellent in continental/cup competitions, and had great performances against big clubs. Starting from his time at Porto to his time at Atletico, he had goal returns of 34, 38, 36, 34, respectively. Those are the kind of goal scoring numbers you would expect from a world class striker.

6639~~~
Probably because his sharpness in and around the box. The quality of his finishes were of the highest order. 

And probably because he did it at the big stages.

I can't see much of the Atletico version slowly moving around at OT though.

6640~~~
How is 204/321 similar to 192/435 or 208/455?

That's literally over 110 games less to get to 200 goals. A .63 average compared to .44 and .45. In the small margins of strikers that's an enormous difference.

6641~~~
Had Rooney played the right 2 yard pass Falcao could have had 2 today lets not forget.

6642~~~
What? How on earth can you compare him to Lambert? Jesus fecking Christ.

6643~~~
I remember seeing a stat at the start of the season that showed that without penalties, the scoring records of Falcao/Negrado/Soldado were worryingly similar, fwiw. I think it was posted on here. There was also a stat of combined goals/assits, or something like that, in La Liga and Falcao wasn't in the top 10. 

That definitely started the alarm bells for me. And, sadly, his performances haven't done anything to alleviate those fears

6644~~~
Thats the thing with Falcao, its always every body else's fault. The pass/cross is always a yard too far ahead, slightly over hit, poorly weighted etc etc Maybe its just that Falcao is a yard too slow?

6645~~~
No, it is all extenuating factors. Always.

6646~~~
I'm talking about his time in La Liga where he got the world class tag

6647~~~
Or in this case, captain fantastic just fecked it up.

6648~~~
Calm down.

He's got 4 goals for a team playing with the likes of Rooney, Mata and Di Maria in behind him, all the while looking slow, laboured and not anything like the Falcao of old.

If we signed any other striker and that's his output, would you be happy? If we signed any other striker for £30-35 million this summer and that's his output, would you be remotely happy or would you deem him a total flop?

Rooney's got 8 goals playing half the time in CM, RvP's got 9 and is slated for his form, Mata's got 5 from midfield... You picking me up on the Lambert comment is just lazy, it's not the point at all. My point is that Lambert is an average Premier League striker (who's got 32 goals in total in the two seasons leading up to this one), and that Falcao's performances and output is that which I'd expect from an average Premier League striker - not from Radamel bloody Falcao. Which leads me to question: What is Falcao now? I've not seen anything to suggest he's still got what he had at Porto and Atletico.

And I'm still to hear an argument: What has he done in a United shirt that any decent Premier League striker couldn't have done? Forget Lambert, what about Pelle, or Harry Kane, or Berahino? Wouldn't they provide as much if not more on the evidence of this season? I think so, which is sad.

6649~~~
Dont tell me to calm down, cheers. I was emphasising how shit your post was. It was hands down the shittest post I've seen since I've been on the forum. Comparing Falcao to Lambert doesn't even deserve a decent response.

6650~~~
Well done then - a fine argument, Sir.

Now tell me: What excactly has Falcao done in a United shirt which any average PL striker couldn't do? 

I mean, most professional football strikers could tap in four goals in almost three quarters of a season for United. And I repeat I'd love him to succeed here. Please help me out, show me the cause for optimism - I just cannot see it. Honestly.

And I don't think it would be astonishing at all if we signed Lambert and he produced a similar tally, which was my point - how is it not extremely disappointing?

 I'm not saying Falcao=Lambert. If you can read and comprehend basic English, I trust you to understand this.

6651~~~
It was what, a yard over hit? Falcao should still easily have made it.

Unless everything has to be laid perfectly on a plate for him to score?

6652~~~
Apparently so.

6653~~~
I haven't said he's worth 40 million and I doubt anybody has, but saying Lambert could make the same contribution? People are seriously underestimating what he offers and we'd look at lot worse if Lambert was up front instead of Falcao. Ridiculous.

6654~~~
Don't bother. Agenda posters out en masse, for some reason, defending a striker which so far looks more of a West Brom level player than a United one.

It's looking more and more likely that the Falcao of old is gone with each passing week. He doesn't have the turn of space to work a yard of space and get his shots in any more, which is why he rushes his finishes or doesn't fire a lot of the time.

I had hope that he'd get back that little yard of pace once his rustiness was gone but it's not going to happen, it's dawning on me. Get more than a bit of a Fletcher feeling about this one.

I think that's sad because I loved watching the old Falcao and it would be amazing to have a striker of that calibre at OT.

6655~~~
Lambert has proved a hell of a lot more in the Premier League playing for a poorer side than Falcao - but as I said ignore that, scr*w Lambert, what about Berahino or Kane or even Pelle? I mean, four goals, for a supposed world class striker? It's not world class it's average. And his overall game has been poor for the most part, he's looked sluggish and easily disposessed, with no turn of pace to get away from players.

Ignoring the price: Would you really want us to sign him this summer? Nothing would please me more than him proving me wrong and putting me to shame, but can you honestly see him suddenly turn it on as he did at Atletico? Can't you see he's gone physically, compared to those days?

6656~~~
Falcao has played in a team that has struggled to create in a lot of games this season,  so he is having to make the most of maybe 3-4 chances at best per game,  and if he doesn't make a couple of those he gets labelled as 'finished', I'd understand if we were creating lots and he wasn't doing the business but he is having to make do with shoddy service most of the time and that's why is alot harder to judge then just by the goals scored stats. Would I say he at his best?  Not at all but given a run of games he could still get 15 goals or so, which wouldn't be a bad return really. In regards to signing him permanently I would try and negotiate the fee,  a football club is a business after all.

6657~~~
Agreed on both counts.

6658~~~
I don't think he's had 3 or 4 chances a game, that's actually harsh on him. He did vs Spurs and Cambridge, and he fluffed them all, but that's not been the case usually.

Anyway, I think the reason he's not getting into enough positions is that he's lost the turn of pace which would have enabled him to get to the Rooney pass today, for instance. I also think it's the reason why he's seemingly rushing his finishing - he's afraid that the defenders will get to him so he fluffs the shots. See the chance Mata laid on a plate for him vs Spurs for one example.

It isn't even his missed chances which is the biggest indicator to me that he's not what he once was - it's his inability to run properly and his lack of pace. Physically he looks a shadow of his former self.

6659~~~
Best option would be to extend the loan by another season

6660~~~
Or spend that rumoured £300K a week on a top CB and a young, pacy striker which gives us options...

6661~~~
If we could get him for 25-30 then yes. There's only a few  strikers in the world that I'd pay 40 odd million for but I've been impressed with him. People (including myself) had very high expectations for him but he's scored 4 goals in 7 starts and has 3-4 assists. He hasn't been world class but to say he's been a west brom level striker is ludicrous.

6662~~~
He just seems a yard off.

For £40m I'd rather use that on other areas in the team.

6663~~~
Man scores goal and plays well in holding up balls with back to goal - gets lambasted even more. 

/forum

6664~~~
Could Rooney be pushed into that poaching role and we use the money to fix the defence and sign an attacking prodigy?

6665~~~
Go watch Sturridge goal. Seemed like there's a little danger when he opened up to the side, and controlled Coutinho's pass. And then, BANG! a simple body move and the ball was in the net.

That's the kind of striker United should go for.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/reU3hWz8VxE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

6666~~~
Had a good game today, but he needs to be more decisive. He had a couple of chances where he should have taken the shot but he was hesitant, probably lacking confidence these days.

He seems to have a good understanding with RVP and they seem to like each other. It's not often you see RVP cheering for a goal that wasn't scored by him. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6667~~~
Too early to decide if he's worth keeping imo. Give him till the end of the season. He was that good a player and so exciting to watch in his prime that I will wait months to see if that man reappears. 
Also he hasn't been shit so far. He's new to he league as is Di Maria so give him time.

6668~~~
Dybala would give us this kind of dynamism up top IMO.

6669~~~
Falcao will be signed I'm in no doubt of that. 4 goals in 9 games is far from shabby and he's improving every game. I cant fault his work rate and application which is important. That goal is more impressive to me than a 40 yard screamer as its a goal scorers goal. He was committed and brave to score it. 

The thing I've noticed about this manager, if he doesn't fancy you, you don't play irrespective of what your being paid and Falcao is now becoming a regular feature in the team. That speaks volumes to me.

6670~~~
Hes not worth more than 20m at his age and coming of the injury unless hes scoring every game tbh. I think he will get there.

What will annoy me is if he regains full fitness here on loan, and then we dont get him and somebody else does and hes at full fitness and scoring like he used to.

6671~~~
Falcao's 4 goals in 773 minutes have won us 8 points. Obviously he hasn't been playing as well as expected, but that is vital considering how close the teams around us are in the league

6672~~~
Then don't respond at all.

6673~~~
And when has one of our forwards been given a pass like that when they have been in that position.

6674~~~
He has also started to get use to the physical side of the PL. He stood up to some strong pressure today. He is getting better as you expect with more game time and getting use to the other players. 

Don't understand the lambasting, but I suppose if we can lambast Rooney, Di Maria, RVP and the likes, he deserves everything. God forbid we actually fall out the top 4, this place will look to hang someone. If we make it, I am sure it is because we were lucky everyone below us had a shite season. All these wonderful in form teams that have yet to over take us. Must be a conspiracy.

6675~~~
Some on here are dissatisfied with anything less than a 5 goal game and Usain Bolt sprint speeds.  Guy's coming off a serious injury, learning the EPL and scoring at a decent rate. 

No need to make a decision until May on the fee. So I'm going to enjoy the ride.

6676~~~
As much as I like Falcao, signing him up long-term would be a major mistake.  The Falcao we are seeing out on the pitch isn't worth 15m, much less what it would cost us in fees + wages to get him.  He is a pale shadow of his previous self and even if he does come close to his former self it is hard to justify a move for a player of his age.  We don't need another RVP situation with an aging striker on the decline.

6677~~~
I'll judge him properly at the end of the season but as of now he's been ok. I've seen almost nothing of the absolute monster that played for Atletico or Porto though, just a decent hardworking striker who seems to be lacking a yard of pace and confidence. The one moment of magic I recall was that control and volley against Everton that hit the bar.

6678~~~
He was OK yesterday as well. Held the ball up nicely and linked well with the other players. However I think we are making a mistake not putting Rooney up top. I think he will do a better job than Falcao is doing now in terms of output. 
Does anyone here get the feeling that Mendes has us over a barrel regarding De Gea's contract and we keep playing Falcao to not upset him? I feel that if we knew for sure that Mendes is trying his best to take DDG away, we would drop Falcao to the bench and put Rooney in his place.

6679~~~
From our point of view, maybe. Would Mendes or even Falcao agree to it seeing that he would be 30 by the end of it and not many, if any, teams would shell out those kind of wages on an ageing striker?

6680~~~
Falcao is getting better every game. His touch and strength are improving and he has always been sharp around goal. My biggest worry is that United decide not to sign him and he scores 30 goals somewhere else next season.

6681~~~
i hope for this as well. 40 million is too much to spend on him as i'm afraid he has not justified that price tag (not yet hopefully)but  i just want him to still be here next season.

if this is an option of course.

6682~~~
It was quite apparent yesterday he's lost a yard off pace and explosiveness which made him so lethal in front of goal. Twice the ball was played through to him and I thought he was going to finish it off first time but both the times he could't move his body quickly enough and had to take it away from goal. 

With such a bigh price tag I hope we give him the skip in the summer.

6683~~~
I thought the was quite good today and I like how strong he with his back to goal and he never stood still which is a sign of a hungry player.

But looking at this from the point of view of signing him for a big fee (and big wages), and with Falcao it's hard to see it from any other perspective, we need to see one of two things for him to justify that. 

Either we see him banging goals in for fun in a vein similar to Deigo Costa has been doing for chelsea or RVN used to for us i.e doing what a top centre forward does. Or he shows his individual class more and is a lot more likely to make things happen on his own and a lot less reliant on his team mates to be a goal threat, like someone like Suarez was last season.

The latter looks unlikely to me. He simply doesn't look the kind of player to beat a couple of defenders with a swivel of the hips and curle one in. So, in that case, let's see if he can do the former.

6684~~~
He was decent yesterday. I've defended him a fair bit on here so far. I don't think he's a bad player or he's finished or anything but I also don't think we will be keeping him after this season. I think LvG experimenting with Di Maria up top for his pace in the last few games tells us that we shouldn't have sold Welbeck. I know Welbeck isn't prolific (neither has Falcao been for us) but his pace would have stretched teams and his phenomenal work rate would mean that we could play two strikers without upsetting the team balance. I'm at a point now where I would be happy with Rooney and/or Mata behind RvP, rather than Falcao. I feel like we've spent a good chunk of the season trying to nurse a previously world class striker back to full fitness and he's still nowhere near his best. His characteristics don't particularly compliment the team (we needed a striker with a bit of pace and trickery to be an ideal adjunct to RvP), and we are having to unbalance the team a bit to shoehorn him in alongside RvP as they're both number 9s who contribute little to our all round play.  Maybe it was a gamble worth taking, with little risk given that it was only a loan deal, his wages aren't much of an issue for us given all of the big earners (Rio, Vida, Evra, Giggs etc) who we got off the wage bill in the summer. In a way he has proven it was worth it as in 9 starts and 5 subs (774 mins) Falcao has 4 goals and 3 assists in the PL, whereas in 15 starts and 1 sub  (1355 mins) Danny Welbeck has 4 goals and 2 assists. There's no arguing that Falcao has slightly better stats in just over half the number of minutes, however our overall team performances (which is what a lot of people on here seem to be moaning about) would probably have been better with Welbeck given that over the past 3-4 seasons he has been a key part of some of our best attacking play.

I accept that this is going to be an unpopular opinion.

6685~~~
Come on Falcao, you've got one now's the time to keep on scoring consistently.

6686~~~
Exactly my thoughts, I don't think he'll recover anymore. And Falcao before the Monaco move was one of my favourite strikers of all time. Anyone who labels him with Negredo and Soldado didn't watch him enough at Atleti and Porto.

6687~~~
Atletico, Porto for a player in his late twenties, hardly any CL performances to show, Atletico and Colombia were more succesfull without him and his statistics appaerently are matched by players like Negredo and Soldado. Not really the profile of a world class striker is it?

I think he was a very good striker who deserved a chance to show he is world class, but still got to prove it. His performances so far suggest there's a reason he played all those years just below the world class. He had to raise his game a bit, and didn't so far.

Lot of talk about RVN here but I don't think he would qualifie as the modern world class striker. That type of striker is just too 'high maintenance', in the end Rooney, Scholes, Ronaldo and Giggs had to provide him with service, and then even Saha had to be added to provide some fluency and someone to hold up the ball upfront, which of course weakened the midfield. And for what? 25 goals a season including penalties and a majority of indecisive goals and goals against the bottom half. It's very difficult to win the PL or do well in the CL if you pay such a high price in service to make this one guy score, while the team needs about 50 goals from other players, and needs decisive goals against the big clubs. At least that would explain why the RVN years ended with poor stats of the really important kind: titles, cups and CL rounds.

The modern world class striker is technically better and doesn't waste posession a lot, provides service himself, doesn't just try to sneak away from his defender but holds the ball when challenged,  doesn't need to be provided with sitters, combines poaching with hunting and scores about twenty goals that really count. Allthough technically quite all right, I'm afraid Falcao is too much a nineties striker, too dependant on 10 players working for his chances.

6688~~~
This tweet from 2011 popped up on my Twitter feed.
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6689~~~
I've heard a few people saying this but I don't really get the logic tbh. De Gea is 24 years old. He isn't a kid. It's up to him whether he signs an extension or not. Mendes' job is to advise him but he can't force him to do anything he doesn't want to. Besides I don't think Mendes will want to screw us over because of Falcao. We have always had a good working relationship with him and I don't see why he would risk losing that over one player.

6690~~~
Does Bebe ring a bell? And I agree with your sentiment that DDG would be making his own choices but everyone listens to their agent to a certain extent.

6691~~~
Frustrating that he didn't get on the pitch yesterday. Would love to know what's happening in training, he must be failing to impress Van Gaal somehow or other.

Looked sharp against Leicester and, having scored, I thought he needed to play again to keep building his confidence and get some more goals. Cambridge seemed the perfect opportunity, so I was surprised to see him not feature at all. Starting to wonder if he's in Van Gaal's long-term plans.

6692~~~
He was rested the same way Valencia, Shaw, Jones and Januzaj were it doesnt have to be a big deal every time he doesnt play especially when its for a game against a League 2 team

6693~~~
Do we really need to rest people for the one competition we have a realistic chance of winning?

I thought McNair came in for Valencia because he looked good against Leicester. Shaw was dropped after struggling to do much going forward. Jones could have been dropped for repeatedly going for the same header as his team mates. And I thought Januzaj picked up a knock so wasn't in the squad for the Cambridge game.

Fair enough if Falcao was rested. I just thought he's a player that needs goals under his belt, and Cambridge at home seemed the perfect opportunity to get a couple.

6694~~~
No chance.

6695~~~
We've got a big squad of players and much fewer games than we would usually have. It's a good thing that he takes whatever chance he can to shake things up a bit. Not so much to rest tired players as give others a bit of competitive football.

6696~~~
When i saw the back 4 i thought it was slected as a dress rehersal for Sunday.  With Rafa/Valencia and Shaw at full backs then i am sure West Ham will be working on Carrol peeling off the centre halves onto the full backs.  I think we'll see that back 4, (jones may come in) on sunday.

As for Falcao, He played longer than RVP on saturday.  The game plan of Fellaini up top meant one had to make way. 

People read far too much into things

6697~~~
I was thinking to myself that the way we were setup yesterday (crosses from wide) was much better suited to Falcao than RvP. He'll probably start the next one though.

6698~~~
I agree with that........I think he would do really well feeding off Fellaini's scraps, plus mata's through balls, plus di maria.  Yesterday's line up was absolutley ideal for Falcao.

6699~~~
Falcao played 90 minutes against Cambridge and QPR and 80 against Leicester so him not playing last night doesnt mean he hasnt impressed or that theres any bigger issue. Valencia has a problem with his hamstring which has been managed all season so he should be given a rest any chance we can get. Jones has played 90 minutes in 9 of the last 10 games so Smalling and Evans were given an opportunity to get some minutes after coming back from injury. Shaw and Januzaj both had cramp at the end of the Leicester game so were never likely to play today. These are all players who have been out with injury or illness at some stage of this season. People complain about all the injuries weve had this season and how its been poorly managed and then claim they've been dropped or try to look for bigger reasons when the manager takes the opportunity to give them a rest or give other players an opportunity to return from injury its ridiculous

Very good post that.

His wages would be better spent on a top player actually at their peak.

I wouldn't buy him for £20m.

6703~~~
Dogshit. needs to be taken off for Herrera/Fellaini

6704~~~
Plain average, everytime he gets the ball, turns back and passes backwards. Just not good enough, to slow, no creativity in his game.

6705~~~
He can honestly barely walk. That chance where Di Maria played the ball ahead of him, you just knew nothing was going to come of it.

6706~~~
Would've preferred Wellbeck over him!

6707~~~
Fellaini has to come for Falcao. I'd say LVG's mind is already made up regarding Falcao. 
Mata, Herrera, Januzaj and Falcao all need to be shipped out over the summer

6708~~~
Awful once again, offers nothing in games like this.

6709~~~
I don't think I've ever seen a supposedly world class player with such appalling technical ability. 

Physically he looks ok, but everytime he gets the ball he just fecks it up.

6710~~~
Touch of a rapist

6711~~~
That first touch <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6712~~~
Poor man's Tevez. Just give up, flog him off to where he wants and play Wilson in there for the rest of the season.

6713~~~
He's atrocious. How he still is getting time ahead of some of our other options on the bench is beyond me.

6714~~~
I'm just happy its a loan deal

6715~~~
We just need to cut our losses and stop forcing him. He's not very good anymore, he doesn't suit us, we have better strikers and midfielders that he's forcing out of the team. 

I wouldn't take him on a free even as just having him is more of a problem

6716~~~
He still looks really slow and off the pace. He's struggling with the tempo of the league.

6717~~~
Cannot understand why we keep playing him, shouldn't be interested in signing him no matter what the price is and he offers nothing.

6718~~~
We need to sign a legitimate Centre Forward or 2

6719~~~
I think its safe to say he will not be signed now

So it would be for the best if he wasnt picked in the harder games like today

<span style="color: #ffffff">Please make me eat my words</span>

6720~~~
I remember watching him at Atletico and he was unplayable at times, he was genuinely a class act. His injury has left him a shadow of that player. I'm losing confidence that he will get back to anywhere near that level.

6721~~~
How the feck is he still on the pitch?

6722~~~
He's so average, very poor striker. 5th sitter he has missed this season.

6723~~~
Well

6724~~~
Berahinho would be more dangerous.

6725~~~
"One of the best striker in the world"..

6726~~~
Get him off he's been fecking shit since joining.

6727~~~
Really seems to be a shadow of his former self now, sad to see considering how good he was before.

6728~~~
He had quite a nice build up thing there!

6729~~~
certainly wasn't him scoring in the toilet cubicle.

6730~~~
I  have to admit.. he is worse than Welbeck.. and Wilson..

6731~~~
It's clearly not going to happen for him here.

6732~~~
And that sums him up. That should be the last time anyone complains about him not getting chances. He's had loads of them and missed most of them.

6733~~~
Not worth the £40 odd million we have apparently agreed.

6734~~~
Ship back to Monaco and be done with it. Play Herrera/Fellaini instead and push Rooney upfront.

6735~~~
Get Wilson in...

6736~~~
Can't we just cancel his loan deal? I'm feeling sick to think what amounts of money we are wasting on his wages.

6737~~~
He's shocking, Diego Forlan in reverse

6738~~~
Done!

Seriously i've defended him to the hills but its chances like why we got him and he flakes time after time. Its like having Hernandez up front again

6739~~~
Radamel Birtles

6740~~~
I want him to do well here but I just don't see it. Don't think he's got it in him to be the player he once was.

6741~~~
Terrible miss, should have been subbed and has to be dropped going forward.

6742~~~
Just give Wilson a chance. Van Gaal is catering too much to his world class players.

6743~~~
No sign of any bit of form coming back. No touch, no real decent efforts on goal.

6744~~~
Yep, I'm done trying to find excuses anymore. Not the player he once was, move on.

6745~~~
It's not really him, is it? It must be an impostor.

6746~~~
Not the player he was. So we'll probably shell out £46M on him.

6747~~~
Is there a worse striker in the league than Falcao now that Altidore is no longer here?

6748~~~
Cue us not taking up the option to sign him, him going to Liverpool and scoring 30 goals.

6749~~~
Maybe in France and Spain he got more time on the ball than here so he looked better at finishing than he is

6750~~~
Hernandez was better

6751~~~
Did well to put it on a plate for RVP there. Our 2 best chances have been created by Falcao, shame he missed that chance.

6752~~~
Haha that must be an imposter!

6753~~~
I've always supported him, but we need to let his loan expire. Not worth it.

6754~~~
He's fecking shit

6755~~~
He's failed the audition. It's a shame but we should be giving up on this one.

6756~~~
10-15 million player at best. Has times where you can see that old class but its not consistent enough.

6757~~~
He needs to go!

6758~~~
Should never ever, ever, ever be signed on a permanent contract

6759~~~
Was incredibly lucky to get the ball under his feet though. RvP couldn't have done any better either.

6760~~~
His finishing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Championship standard player thesedays.

6761~~~
He should be sent back to loan if that's possible. He's a negative influence on RVP.

6762~~~
Poor again. At times his control is shocking. I'd rather recall Hernandez.

6763~~~
I thought he needed a run of games...doesn't look like this will work out, done coming up with excuses for him.

6764~~~
He's genuinely shite.

6765~~~
He still has time to change my opinion. Let him go back to Monaco, knock Arsenal out and he'll definitely be a favorite of mine.

6766~~~
Without a doubt, it's fair to say that Falcao is finished when it comes to being the great player he used to be. There isn't a single excuse to justify this performance in terms of passing, controls and obviously finishing. Poor player, our worst striker.

6767~~~
Good luck Mendes with finding another club for him in the summer.

6768~~~
Shouldnt be signed for big money

6769~~~
Unforgivable miss.

6770~~~
God i hope we dont sign him

6771~~~
It's even worse. He used to be a striker that could score goals out of nowhere. These days he can't even finish the clear cut chances anymore. Looks like he is doing a Torres.

6772~~~
He's what I would call the anti-striker. fecks sakes. At least Welbeck could run a bit.

6773~~~
Too late to terminate the loan?

6774~~~
This is why I love football. The unpredictability. 

Falcao earns 3 times what Eriksen and Kane do combined and yet he's got 4 goals to their 33.

6775~~~
Better still

6776~~~
Thought he did well holding the ball up for majority of the game but he seriously should be burying that chance in a game deciding situation.

6777~~~
The injury killed him. There was always a chance it would. No idea why someone would take a punt on him after that, at his age, with his attributes.

6778~~~
That miss today somewhat ended my patience with him

6779~~~
Absolutely dire season.

I have not seen him do one ''thing'' - a pass, a turn, a touch, a dribble - one thing that has been impressive and made me think he actually is a top footballer.

6780~~~
I just said in the post-match thread, but yeah... the worst performance from any one of our players this season

Should never start a game for us again, lets play Wilson instead - he's part of our future.

6781~~~
That was hilariously bad from him today. Deserves to get dropped for our next few games because he's seriously been a massive disappointment. 

I miss Hernandez.

6782~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Enjoyed writing that up, didn't you ?

6783~~~
Abysmal. Kept falling over the ball and that miss was unforgivable.

6784~~~
I've been sticking by him all season, but I lost hope in him today.

6785~~~
So another striker is an absolute must this summer. Someone to play back-up to Rooney hopefully, but that's not going to happen.

6786~~~
If you watch the replay, he could have taken the ball with his right foot, but then second doubted and went for the left corner, left boot. Stunning miss.

6787~~~
We need your .gif Top.

6788~~~
It will be madness if we sign him to a long term deal. Not only has he lost a yard but I think that he struggles with the amount of pressure that Premier League defenders put him under.

6789~~~
I've been a staunch supporter of Falcao but today was just appalling. Not sure if its the partnership with RVP or the lack of service, but that miss was the final straw for me.

He just looks out of sync and doesn't fit well into this diamond formation. I don't blame him entirely though because RVP and Rooney are struggling to come to terms with this horseshit that LVG has us playing.

Needs to be dropped or played upfront with Rooney and not RVP. We also need to field two wingers to give him adequate service.

6790~~~
Keep bragging.

6791~~~
Funny how you put down Falcao but say RVP couldn't have done better. Following the trend of having different standards for Falcao on here. 

RVP could've not hit it at the goalkeeper? Maybe in the corner or high into the roof of the net? 

Falcao was a bit lucky but still got it under control with a defender on his back and had the awareness to play a perfect pass to his strike partner.

6792~~~
He plays like he's on his last legs every time a pass is made to him. We've already got one slouch in RvP. Having Falcao too goes completely against what the philosopher said in the summer about balance.

6793~~~
You could blame the system all you want but striker of his reputation should be expected to put that chance away and he balloons it.

Could've been the difference between draw and a win today.

6794~~~
Someone to lead the line hopefully. It wont be Rooney.

6795~~~
Send him back to France now

6796~~~
I take it we have nobody left who wants to see him be signed

Its quite sad watching him. He really does care and try hard, but he has no quality left at all

6797~~~
He's clearly trying his hardest but he just doesn't have it anymore.

6798~~~
He's not the same Falcao we used to see in the past,in the best interest of United i hope we don't sign him.

6799~~~
Criminal miss.

6800~~~
I'll be dissappointed if he's used as more than a sub for the rest of the season. I'd rather see Wilson given the chance

6801~~~
I've defended him a lot this year but his finishing has become so poor it's inforgivable at this level. He works hard and tries but that just isn't enough. That was our chance which was really a sitter and he can't miss that.

6802~~~
Really, really hope that we haven't sealed the deal yet and hope we send him back home.

6803~~~
We took a gamble bringing him in after such an injury. The injury was extremely serious and at his age, had the potential to basically ruin him. He looks a shadow of the player he once was which is a shame. It seems some on here don't appreciate what a great player he was in his prime. I think we should steer well clear of making him a permanent signing.

6804~~~
Sad to say but he just isn't the player he was. Can't fault his effort he put a lot into it but just doesn't seem to have it anymore. Go for someone else in the summer.

Edit: He was a bloody great player in his day though, people shouldn't dismiss that.

6805~~~
His first touch is crap. Still thought he was better than Van Persie though as he at least dropped deep and got involved with holding it up etc. Feeds off scraps too, would like to see him up top alone with Mata behind.

6806~~~
Indefensible miss and should have been taken off earlier

6807~~~
I've been patient with Falcao but after today, I'm done. The fact that Mendes keeps talking about Falcao's ability means he knows he's finished and he's trying desperately to convince some top team to take him.

6808~~~
that was a miss. didn't even need a save. left foot maybe - WC strikers score them.

6809~~~
I like him, wish it would work out for him but there's just no way we should pay the money for him. It kind of summed it up for me when he had that great chance and I just had no confidence he'd score, I knew he'd miss. Even despite his work rate and decent build up play, he's looked real bad in front of goal and I've no idea if it's a confidence thing or if it's something else but it doesn't look like it's going to get any better. Be amazed if we sign him permanent, better off looking somewhere else. It's a shame.

6810~~~
He had 4 shots today. 0 were on target

6811~~~
It's incredibly disappointing to see him like this. You could forgive the sloppy touches here and there if he was more clinical in front of goal. He would have finished that comfortably on his left during his prime.

6812~~~
That miss was his Welbeck vs Neuer moment. fecked it up.

6813~~~
Looks like fecking Bambi whenever he has the ball.

Utterly useless.

6814~~~
He's done, signing him permanently will be a huge mistake. I do admire his endeavour unlike Van Persie who is almost undroppable in Van Gaal's eyes.

6815~~~
That's right, and with the massive fee and wages that we'll have to spare when we pull out of the Falcao deal who's to say whether or not we'll come in with a HUGE offer for Kane?

Why pay 40m for Falcao when you could get Kane for the same!

6816~~~
Decent strikers keep it on target too.

6817~~~
Best deal we did this summer was to take him on a loan. His market value must have gone down to 15m euro by now - top!

6818~~~
I hope this donkey isn't playing for us come next season.

We have become a worse team trying to shoe-horn this big name player in to our team who is simply not good enough anymore.

He has had plenty of chances to show what he can do.

6819~~~
Going into detail here but why the hell did he try to hit it with his left? Easy dink over Adrian with the right no?

6820~~~
Really sad to see him like this. I have been supportive for the whole season but he is getting worse and worse. Its hard to be critical of him because he's a very likeable player. He tries hard, he obviously cares about the team, and he's a good team player. But his touch, speed, control, and finishing is just not there at all. He's getting the chances, both to be in the starting XI and to score goals, and he isn't taking them. Really, really sad.

6821~~~
No matter the foot used, from that distance and where the ball is positioned, if you don't hit the target then something is wrong.

6822~~~
Yea agree. His overall play was pretty poor too.

6823~~~
It's so strange how he just looks shot. I could understand maybe if his injury had impeded him physically (lost a yard or two of pace etc) but when he gets the ball his legs begin to resemble that moment when spaghetti begins to soften up in boiling water.

6824~~~
I think you should send him back to Monaco, then sign Lacazette.

6825~~~
I thought he was better than RVP today (other than his shit finishing).  Put himself about and used his strength well, won a bunch of shoulder-to-shoulders against their defenders.  Not sure why he's getting such a slating to be honest, guess people are just pissed off with that awful miss towards the end.

6826~~~
So, where are the 'its everyone eles's fault' brigade?

6827~~~
We leased this guy to do what today he failed to do in spectacular fashion, which is to score goals.  He works hard but all he's doing is holding Wilson back from proper game time to develop him while putting in poor performances.  I hope we're rid when the season ends.

6828~~~
some think that because he's been so sh1t that wilson's getting the nod off the bench. wonder if he would have if united kept one of chich/welz

6829~~~
We've had a good long test drive of this expensive car and it's missing the top couple of gears. Time to take it back to the lot and start looking elsewhere.

It seems like loan players typically struggle for minutes, we've been very generous with playing time for Falcao and I think it's becoming detrimental to the club.

6830~~~
Said it before, will say it again - Falcao has come to the wrong league at this point in his career! PL is simply too fast, too physical and too rambunctious for him.

Should move to Italy.

6831~~~
Looking forward to hear what <a class="username" data-user="90429, @VanGaalEra" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90429/">@VanGaalEra</a> thinks now, after being told by him Falcao is still amazing...

6832~~~
Definitely the wrong place to come after an injury like that.

6833~~~
His hold up play was very good. He looked to be the only one up for the physical challenge, and he was using his body really well. He kept opponents much bigger than him off the ball. The chance he missed was tough, but he's set himself to score with the wrong foot, so it looked like a howler.

Still, he's starting to remind me of Torres at Chelsea. He's working hard, and doing a lot of stuff right, except for the finish. He's a good team player and I really like his tenacity and desire. He had more of it than most of our players today. But he needs to score, and be scoring regularly.

6834~~~
Nah, he was truly shocking - well before that miss, which was the only good thing he actually did today (as it required some sort of movement). 

His first touch is horrible, when he dribbles he runs straight into trouble and loses the ball, and if he decided to not dribble he passes it 20 yards back. He doesn't use the ball in any form of intelligent manner. RVP - and I'm not saying he was good - actually tried to use the ball in a smart manner, and its obvious that his touch hasn't yet deserted him. RVP looked to get people in today, as well himself... Falcao just looked lost.

6835~~~
I hope he picks up a knock and doesn't play for us again.

Can't feel sorry for someone producing such a shite level but taking £300,000 a week.

Sadly, he's been a waste of space.

6836~~~
He must be the slowest striker in the PL? He's so slow, sometimes I expect him to start going backwards.

6837~~~
Definitely, he needs to be somewhere less physical and where that half a yard he's lost won't be so apparent.

If Mendes cares at all about the lad he'll get him off to Italy. It's that or the MLS for Falcao I reckon.

6838~~~
Good, it wasn't just me then!

Know what you mean, but at least he has scored four goals in 12 starts.  Nowhere near as many as you'd hope, but thank God he's not having a proper goal drought like Torres did IIRC.

6839~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6840~~~
And then after a year of rebuilding himself physically and most importantly confidence wise, he would have performed much better.

6841~~~
Must have been watching a different match, I thought he looked more up for it than most of our team.  His technique was a bit shit, but he got stuck in, wouldn't say he looked lost at all.

6842~~~
it was his right foot  , that's how bad he hit it

6843~~~
Sadly I'm leaning to the other side now. Lets buy a younger, pacier forward. Its a modern way nowadays. 
Not worth the money, maybe he'll suddenly flourish in the next team but that's a risk I suppose.
He looks like a old school slow CF and he isnt even scoring.

6844~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> holy moley

6845~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6846~~~
If we keep playing him like a guaranteed first choice, I fear we will waste money on this deal.

6847~~~
He does battle well, and he's got good body strength and knows how to use it. But considering he's known as a world class finisher - that this is basically his game - he needs to be scoring the type of chances he got today. It's not beyond the bounds of possibility that if we keep playing him, he'll go on a mad run of goals, but I want to see it soon.

6848~~~
Fully agree. Serious campaign going on here.

His service was poor today unless he made the chance himself too.

6849~~~
Unless he goes on a goal scoring run from now until the end of the season he has no chance of being signed on a permanent basis.

6850~~~
We have posters wishing injury on Falcao? Wow. 

RVP getting an easy ride for missing a chance created by Falcao while Falcao is getting absolutely slated after he did excellently to create his own chance? Both missed easy chances but only one having injury wished on him. 

Massive double standards in this thread. Clearly he doesn't look the player he once was but he's nowhere near as bad as people make out. 

Looked very strong today, held the ball up well, played the right pass a few times and the wrong pass a few times. Created 2 chances, missed 1 chance.

6851~~~
If you can find where I said he's amazing, I'll respond.

Until then, be thankful for Blind's goal keeping you 7th and not dropping to 8th. You must have celebrated with us.

6852~~~
Agree once again. Post match reaction to him is getting ridiculous, RAWK standard.

6853~~~
Poor game from Radz today, but he was bought to finish chances he gets, even if that's one chance like he got today, and he disappointed.

6854~~~
Love the guy, really wanted him to be a success here. But I feel the same as everyone else, it would not be sensible at all to spend 40 mil on him, and we certainly will not be.

6855~~~
He isn't likely to do either imo. He's a shell of the player he was 2-3 years ago and will never again be remotely as good.

6856~~~
Yep. Those are the chances he should be gobbling up and it's his whole purpose in the team really. He's had his opportunity now in my eyes and we should end this experiment. Proper squeaky but time already and we can't have any passengers.

6857~~~
It's got to the stage where signing him permanently would be nothing other than mental. I just can't see it.

6858~~~
To be brutally honest, his body strength and battling is the <i>only </i>thing he does well now. The rest of his game is appalling.

6859~~~
He is a battler, I'll give him that, but there's just no spark there for me. I genuinely don't think he was bad today but he wasn't good either. I thought it would be these kind of tough, take-your-one-chance games where he'd come into his own.

He's running out of time.

6860~~~
I wouldnt even say heis even that good at it.

6861~~~
I love short sightedness. You do realize that if Kane and Eriksen keep producing like this, big clubs will inevitably come in for them with big wages, and you'll be forced to sell?

6862~~~
I love how you're always lurking in the corner waiting to drop a stink bomb. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6863~~~
If I was in charge of Utd's spending I'd go all out to sign Kane actually. And I mean <i>all out</i>.

6864~~~
I actually don't think he's as bad as he's made out to be. He just doesn't work with RVP at all. Give him someone like Wilson or Rooney beside him and I think he'll be a very different player. You can occasionally see the quality he has when he holds off defenders and sets up other players. Still not convinced he'd be worth signing though.

6865~~~
It's like we're talking about Cameron Jerome.

6866~~~
More often than not he's outmuscled. He had a bit more success the 2nd half today, but over the course of the season its been a low point for him

6867~~~
His build up play was ugly today.

6868~~~
Persisting with Falcao and RvP together could cost us a top 4 spot. It's that detrimental.

6869~~~
Falcao doing a Torres at United and Torres doing a Falcao at Atletico.

6870~~~
This is the first time he's looked more like his old self, for me. More successful in shielding the ball and turning defenders around, and that one time he looked to turn the ball and set himself up for a clear chance, it bumbled a bit and thus went the wrong way. Would've been an incredibly well-crafted sitter if he'd managed it.

He's earned more game-time, for me. He'll come good.

6871~~~
He's very hit and miss. One minute he looks like the hulk, holding off 2 or 3 players, the next he's being bundled off the ball with ease.

In all the honesty, the fact that we've resorted to a discussion about his best feature being how good his hold up play is, kind of shows what a disaster of a signing he's been.

I'm thinking more Emile Heskey, but with less step overs.

6872~~~
The time to take a decision over him should come soon. If we decide not to buy him, I don't see any reason to keep starting him every game, I honestly don't think he's offering much and he will only get more frustrated every game. 

It was a strange transfer from the start, probably the main reason why Rooney is playing midfield.

6873~~~
Start Rooney and Wilson up top with Mata behind. Let's inject some pace and energy into the front line..

6874~~~
Useless posts above again, what does playing with RVP have to do with missing sitters? No excuses for him mate, he's been bang average, even Danny Ings has been at least twice as good, very very poor.

6875~~~
That would be worth a go.

6876~~~
Even then, would a good three months or so outweigh the pretty abject 5 or 6 months he's had thus? Even if he had a good last few months and knocked in 15 goals odd I would be pretty worried all we'd have been seeing was something akin to a dead cat bounce. IMO the player he was is gone and the player he is isn't good enough to do what we need him to do. Let's just move on to the next client Mendes convinces Ed to waste our money on.

6877~~~
He was really poor in general and that miss in the 2nd half was shocking. Just completely the wrong technique and execution, was the kind of finish you'd expect from a defender.

I thought he was slightly better than RVP for what it's worth but that's neither here or there. He shouldn't be getting signed permanently in the Summer.

6878~~~
I can only echo what most people seem to feel. He's not worth the massive cost to sign him permanently. I hope he proves me wrong for the rest of the season but can't see it at the moment.

6879~~~
Plus there's barely any chance that he'd suddenly recover his form and go on a scoring run. Has an underperforming striker ever suddenly recover his from and scored 10+ in the space of 3 months?

I was really excited about Falcao coming here but that excitement has turned into massive disappointment by now.

6880~~~
I'm not sure what game you were watching, cause nearly every time I seen him on the ball, the next second he'd lost it.

6881~~~
you , me and united's nation.

6882~~~
Good luck finding a club that's going to pay him £265,000 a week on top of a £43million transfer fee.

6883~~~
I can't imagine that any team will be willing to meet his asking price to be honest.

6884~~~
Well he's on loan at United, so that isn't our problem.

6885~~~
RVP and Falcao is the complete opposite of Cole-Yorke tandem ie two prima donnas, whose past their best and offer no pace or creativity at all.

6886~~~
You think this game today where he missed and sitter and was probably the worst he has been so far was Falcao looking like his old self?

I refuse to believe a human being posted this legitimately.

6887~~~
I reckon people will still be excusing his performances this season for years to come. It's bizarre.

6888~~~
Definitely not the worst he has been, his all round play was good at times. Nothing like old Falcao though. 

I've made my mind up on him now though and it's a no. 

The £6m loan punt, would I do it again? Definitely.

6889~~~
The miss was bad, really really awful. But the rest of the game wasn't too bad, I actually thought it was pretty positive. Better than RvP that I'd drop before the Colombian, definitely. 

But that miss was really, really bad.

6890~~~
Definitely a loan punt is always a good  option. In this case it has not worked though.

6891~~~
All of which would be quite positive it RvP didn't look like he was in his own decline. From being extremely comfortable with our strikers at the start of the season I'm now wondering how the hell we are actually going to solve this. Wilson is still a year or two away from being able to play at a decent level most weeks and he doesn't fancy Rooney up there. I've asked this a few times, but where is the next world class striker going to come from?

6892~~~
Why? Him being here has caused pure hassle. Rightly or wrongly we lost an academy player who whilst not top quality, has qualities we lack. It's caused another to have to impress in short cameos usually on the wing. It's caused us to sacrifice Mata and Herrera to put him and the other big names in. All for very little. If the ball is not put BANG ON the plate I have no confidence he can get the goals. That's the worst thing. All that money and expectation for something Chicharito could have done.

6893~~~
It's genuinely worrying. There is no doubt that RVP and FALCAO are past their best. You could easily apply that to Rooney as well. We need something fresh up front, ideally someone with a bit of pace and power. But who is out there? There isn't a top striker that springs to mind at all that would be available.

6894~~~
Switch to 4-3-3 with 1 striker and invest in ine if the world class wide forwards.

6895~~~
Looked <i>more</i> like his old self. You seem to have taken a strong interpretation of what I said, but I stand by that some of the moves he showed today will be goals in other matches when he's found his legs even more.

6896~~~
For those who are saying that he can hold the ball up and offer an assist.
Sure, that's fine if you were buying a player for £15M. But when you are going to play as a striker for Man Utd (one of the biggest clubs in the World), offering a few assists doesnt cut it.
You need to be inspirational and a game changer.

A few years back, when our team wasnt playing particularly well, you always thought, well, we have Ruud Van Nistlerooy upfront. We have a chance. 2 Seasons ago, the same could be sent for RvP. Even Rooney.
But Falcao just isnt a game changer. 
If were in the Semi Final or Final of a Champions League, could you honestly rely on Falcao to score a sensational goal, out of nothing? That's the sort of striker we need.

He's good. But not great and certainly not good enough to be our No.1 striker.

6897~~~
His finishing just isn't the Falcao I remember or expected. When he went through on goal you would expect him to bury that, I don't understand why he didn't use his left foot, he just had to hit the target that close!

6898~~~
Yep.
Given his current form, if this guy scored 1 goal, I'd be amazed.

I'd be in shock if that happened.
So far, he has made 14 appearances and scored 4. Those are the cold hard facts.

I dont think Falcao is a 30 goal a season player, now.
I think 10 goals per season is what you can expect from him (next season). Anything more is a bonus.

And when you think that Costa is currently on 17 goals (and counting), it puts into perspective what Falcao offers.

I think this experiment needs to be put to be shut-down.

6899~~~
He's not even that anymore. He's poor at best.

6900~~~
If he goes on to rediscover his old form, then definitely, and it would be justified. If not, then people will remember this season as the one where Falcao's decline as a world class striker became highly apparent.

Anyway, short of a goal-scoring run that would be nothing short of miraculous at this stage, I can't see us paying even 10m for Falcao (given his enormous wages).

6901~~~
It was definitely worth the gamble. It didn't pay off, but if it had we'd be laughing at the moment.

6902~~~
Well and truly Torres'd.

6903~~~
Just been reading the first few pages of this thread, never would have thought he would turn out to be this disappointing <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Lacazette or even Harry Kane <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

6908~~~
Do not want.

6909~~~
Was unsure about when we got him from the beginning and now I am done. He battles hard and shows good strength but he is not worth what we are paying him and what we will need to pay for the full deal. Isn't the same player he was and causes more headaches than solutions for us. Hope he can go somewhere else and do well but it's time to bench him and play him in the less important matches.

6910~~~
I thnk the Caf's rating for him (6.0) is fair.  He's been average.  Scored some goals, missed some chances.  Problem is that we're paying wages commensurate with a top striker, which is not the case so far.  The £40M (if true) fee is also not supported by his performances. 

I thought it was silly to write him off early on, as he was recovering match fitness coming off the injury.  There's been a slight improvement, but he's not been an elite level striker. 

I like his engine-but there's unfortunately been more heat than light.  Would take a huge turnaround to justify anything close to his reported fee.

6911~~~
I like Falcao.  I want him to succeed at Manchester United.  I have been hoping to see him return to the form he has had with previous clubs.  I have all but lost hope in Falcao after todays match.  He looked as if he was going to be pushed off the ball every time he took possession of it.  His layoff to RvP for the shot toward the end of the game was the only positive I could think of.  He did nothing.  I hate to say it but I cannot see him staying past this season.

6912~~~
is Premier League too fast or he is slow ? i lost count the number of times he lost the ball just because he is a second too slow to react.

6913~~~
Hes playing better than RVP but im starting to think hes never going to be worth what it will cost us to sign him permanently. We're not exactly providing him with chance after chance, but its February, he should be burying those 1 on 1s by now.

6914~~~
You're using the benefit of hindsight now. What a wonderful thing it is. 

Here's what you thought of Falcao in June last year while talking about Cavani:

So you identify him as one of the top four strikers in the world but offered the chance again, with no benefit of hindsight, you wouldn't have taken him on £6m loan for a season try before you buy deal just 3 months later?

6915~~~
Do posters on here think it was a clear cut one on one chance? I thought keeper did an ultimately good job to immediately cut the space and the defender was on his shoulder. RvP had an easier chance imho.

6916~~~
He gets one or two chances to score per GAME, WTF do u expect, LVG has stiffened United, with his negative approach regardless, of the the opposition!

6917~~~
He has some pretty easy chances that a so called £45m striker should be taking and he has missed them. It wasn't just the West Ham game too. 

Falcao was supposed to be a ruthless finisher. He is anything but that at the moment.

6918~~~
My concern right now isn't even that we will sign him permanently. I refuse to believe LvG and Woodward would be so stupid. It's the harm its causing the team at the moment which has the potential to affect our short term targets for this season (namely top four).

I have nothing against him. I backed him returning to his best in here for a long long time. However, he is at the epicentre of all our current issues. The defence (which pundits and oppo fans exaggerate about) isn't even an eigth of the problem Falcao's continued selection is causing.

6919~~~
I think Falcao is used to being the man up top. Maybe the problem is that he is currently sharing that with V.Persie. They run into eachothers space and there seems to be no chemistry between them what so ever. Maybe we are just more suited to a 1 striker system. Play one or the other, not both.

6920~~~
Why are people only talking about that chance? I used to love Falcao's style of play earlier in his career, but it's been pretty clear since November that injuries have ruined him. It's a shame, but he shouldn't be a starter for us. And his career is practically done.

6921~~~
He had a poor game (as did most of our team) and he really should have come off

6922~~~
Amazed that you (and many others) can somehow give Van Persie a pass when discussing our problems up front. He's played a lot more games and been no better. Falcao's been crap but has far better excuses for his crapness. The real elephant in the room is the amount of time his strike partner has been getting on the pitch. Time his performances don't deserve.

6923~~~
It's a bit annoying that he's here and we have a much better striker out on loan somewhere else.

I accept this is a judgement made fully with the use of hindsight, but yeah... though actually, it's far more annoying that he's playing when we have a great striker - whom we fully own - playing in midfield.

6924~~~
Agreed.

Falcao is getting over a serious knee injury, playing in a new league, with a manager he's not played for before.

RVP has none of those excuses, yet his performance is only marginally better than Falcao's.

6925~~~
The difference for me is so far, Van persie is paid for - Falcao is going to cost us another £40M <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>. 

I like Falcao a lot, but he just isn't what I hoped we would get. I thought he would be stretching teams in behind and finishing like he used too, but at the minute I would have rather kept Hernandez to be honest!

6926~~~
Surely the price can be renegotiated after current performances? or would it have been agreed when the loan deal was struck? Both wages and fee have to be significantly reduced if we are to sign him.

6927~~~
Yeah, the money is a biggie. Falcao's not exactly made a case for spending any money him, never mind £40m. In a way, that makes life simpler, though. We can just call it quits and walk away in the summer.

RvP is a real problem though. Been shite for ages and is ne of our highest earners so it will be very difficult to find a club to match his current wages if we want rid. If we decide to bite the bullet and sack off both strikers that's going to be a massive headache in the summer. And it looks more and more like that's exactly what we need to do.

6928~~~
He looks so heavy on the pitch. His movement is heavy. His touch is heavy. His running with the ball is heavy. His shots and passes are so laboured. He just doesn't look comfortable. It's like we have a wet mash potato as a striker. When he corked that chance, there was literally three pages of posters on the match day thread ruing the miss. Three pages! that's how bad it was.

Obviously, if he doesn't improve his form and goals scored, we shouldn't buy him.

The only dilemma now is who should be dropped for the next game, him or van Persie. And surely we cannot get rid of both strikers in the summer. That would be crazy. There would only be one option regarding this matter...

6929~~~
RVP has a year left on his deal I believe, so if we did ignore Falcao, RVP could have a year on the bench and then he will be gone too. I think sticking with Rooney, Wilson and getting 1 more striker (Dybala/Lacazette etc) would be ideal. Playing a 4-3-3 with pacey wingers would be my preferred formation.

6930~~~
We have to many supposed « big » players in the same post in our team. This team was supposed to be unbalanced with too many numbers 10s or striker, but it’s exactly the same, or worse now with our recruitment. We haven’t been clever by adding Falcao to our team.

We could have done our season with RVP and Rooney upfront and keeping Chicha, here you have 3 different types of strikers.

Falcao has the same runs as RVP, they can’t combine and can’t play together.

He’s been awful yesterday, but like RVP to be honest. Their partnership are nullifying them, first they’re not in great form, but they’re not playing well.

We can complain the lack of services, the bad runs, crosses etc, but they had once chances  yesterday and failed.

I’m totally against paying him and having him in our squad this summer. It’s either him or RVP for me. And I would prefer keeping RVP because we have not to pay 35-45M for him this summer.

LVG tactics is not good enough to make him shine, but Falcao is not good enough for us. He should (like RVP), bring us forward, being our talisman (like Costa, Sanchez, Aguero or Sturrigde for their team), but he’s more a problem.

Bench him and RVP now and play Wazza as a number 9.

LVG said hat Roo won’t play midfielder forever, “depending on the strikers form”… They’ve been awful this season, and it’s time to be better

6931~~~
I agree that RvP's chance was really good as well (I don't know about better) and you'd expect better from him, but Falcao's was a clear one on one, and it's pretty terrible he didn't even get it on target. In that position, you have to at the very least test the keeper. Overall, I think he's been better than RvP though, who is having a horrible season and should be dropped.

6932~~~
RvP's chances was much easier. On his stronger foot and a perfect height to get a shot off. Falcao's was on his wrong foot and at an akward height. You'd still expect someone with his reputation to convert it with ease though. Just couldn't sort his feet out at all, which has been a theme with his missed chances this season.

6933~~~
Yeah I thought it was weird how he decided to try to hit it with the outside of his right foot given the height, I think poking it with the left would have at least got it on target. But obviously, it happens in a split second and it's more down to muscle memory so who knows. And as you say, VP's chance was almost on a platter, a couple of years ago he'd have smashed that into the roofing of the net.

6934~~~
Regarding the business with him, Mendes and De Gea, I don't believe for a second that we are being forced to sign him in order to get De Gea to sign a new contract. I do think it's possible that we are playing Falcao to keep him sweet. 

If we did decide Falcao wasn't good enough and benched him and restricted his minutes for the rest of the season it would really hurt his chances of getting one last big contract somewhere. It's some interesting politics that's fo sho.

6935~~~
Wouldnt sign him to clean the boots at the moment. 

Service to our front two is woeful and tbh RVP doesn't look much better but for the money they're talking I'd need to see a lot more to he convinced he's worth i .

6936~~~
I was assuming you were talking about taking him back on a loan move next season.

Sorry for the misinterpretation. I was excited for this move but it has proven a failure. I wouldn't bring him back at all next season but fair enough the punt for this season was a gamble which could have gone well.

6937~~~
Gutted Falcao missed his big chance yesterday. He had a decent game, and everyone would've been raving about him if he'd stuck that away. Those are the margins, and as a striker, sometime you try too hard <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6938~~~
He was getting a lot of stick before that chance to be fair... to be honest, for me, the chance was the only semi-decent thing he did yesterday (as it was the only time he showed any form of decent movement)... away from that, he was god-awful.

6939~~~
I think the problem was he missed the target completely. If he hit it at the keeper and he saved it, you would have to give props to the keeper and say he was unlucky. But to completely miss the target from 5-10 yards is just beyond stupid given your an elite footballer.

6940~~~
Falcao is as good on his left as he is on his right when it comes to striking the ball. Scored some ridiculous shots with his left before.

This

6941~~~
He just isn't the player he was of a couple of seasons ago. I can't recall a moment this season where Falcao has done something that has made you think "this guy is quality".

6942~~~
So far we'd have been better off with Hernandez let's be straight. And yesterday I'd rather have seen Wilson get a game, he at least will try make something happe .

6943~~~
His movement within the box is exceptional - but we are rarley in and around the oppositions box.

His hold up play/ first time lay off is also very good.

I said it before either in this thread or a different one.......if Radamel Falcao, Ander Herrera and Angel Di Maria played for Liverpool, all 3 would be performing at level much higher than they are for us.  We are soooooooo slow, clumbersome and unadventerous in possession.

6944~~~
Losing hope on this as it progresses, every game that goes by its just not working remotely. 

Dont know if its him, or him and RVP or Utd. But he had a chance and didnt take it and seemed to take an extra step that wasnt necessary. Eventually set up RVP for one chance, but was actually turning inside and got tackled, which was the wrong choice, before laying it off. 

I want him to do well. Its just really not happening at the moment.

6945~~~
At this point in time, given the choice between A) Having him signed up, so Mendes has De Gea sign an extension for us or B) not signing this guy up and having to find a new keeper or have Valdes as our number 1, I'd choose option B.

At least with B, we can blood Wilson in instead of wasting our time seeing Falcao struggling.

6946~~~
From what I've seen, Falcao has been slow, cumbersome and unadventurous in possession himself. He isn't the cause of that problem in your team but he definitely hasn't helped it.

I wouldn't take him at Liverpool for the amount he'd cost. Our non-Sturridge options are shit but he couldn't fit into our style either.

6947~~~
It depends really, I think with Sterling, Coutinho and Lallana providing speed and creation, and him playing as CF in your team, he'd do pretty well. He'd be getting a ton more chances than he is in our set up and would probably be finding his goalscoring boots again. It's a matter of opinion and it's a bit silly as it's fiction football really, but I'm pretty convinced he'd do better elsewhere. Probably not as well as his top form at Atletico, but nowhere near what he's producing at the moment.

6948~~~
Falcao will never replicate his previous form in this United line up, it's legitimately impossible. Either sell him or move on the likes of RVP/Rooney. You can't have them all.

6949~~~
I think Falcao's confidence is just really low and at the moment we're not a club that can give him time to get his game back. We need people who can pick up the rest of the team, not the reverse.

He doesn't look like he's lost any pace. Just the opposite, he does a lot more headless chicken running than he ever did at Atletico. But the sharpness & decision making has just gone. I suspect he could get them back, but Im not hopeful itll be at United. And for £45M? Even Eddy Woodward would have trouble justifying that kinda cash.

6950~~~
Sign him up! He's a world class forward. Don't be fooled by bad form and poor team tactics. Ronaldo would look shit upfront in this United team

6951~~~
I've seen Falcao play in person a few times long before he came here. . . He really was a beast and he just looked like someone who was going to batter defences and there was nothing that you could do about it.

Forget about his form and his playing for a moment, the guy just looks lost.

6952~~~
Has he actually managed to get one cleanly hit shot in yet this season? He has an incredible knack of shanking every single shot he takes. 

Close range, miss hits it, long range, miss hits it, free kicks, straight into the wall.

6953~~~
He is struggling but at least he appears to be trying unlike a certain someone else who looks more disinterested than a dog at a vegan buffet.

6954~~~
His talent is unquestionable but i think he is lacking confidence, the problem is highlighted by Van Persie misfiring as well, James Wilson being young, enthusiastic but raw and Wayne Rooney being played in midfield. With Di Maria also being way out of form as well we are properly struggling for goals.

6955~~~
Too many excuses, many of you can't be trusted to run a business when you need to be ruthless and make a decision. On the evidence of this season, we'll be stupid to offer him a permanent contract here.

6956~~~
Keep seeing this sentiment of "No-one could do much better than Falcao with our service", "Ronaldo would look shit in this team" etc...

It's amazing how strikers like Ings at Burnley, Austin at QPR and Berahino at West Brom have so completely out-shined Falcao.

Jonathan Walters at Stoke has been more of a goal threat than him.

Goals don't just rely on service, they rely on movement, and Falcao is bordering on immobile by PL standards.

Further still, goals rely on chances taken, and even in that department Falcao isn't taking his chances.

We're paying this guy elite player wages, and while I don't feel resentment toward him, I certainly think that the borderline sympathy needs to stop. He isn't good enough, and the club should show it's ruthlessness imo. Don't reward an overpaid burden of a player with game-time.

6957~~~
His movement is superb. Its the service that is sorely lacking. Rooney only wants to  make cross field balls to Valencia who proceeds to cross into his marker. Do you think those strikers you mentioned would shine in this United setup? Honestly now. Even Wilson would've probably scored more goals with his limited appearances at Spurs

6958~~~
The forward partnership at United has been very poor for a few seasons now. You could count the number of passes Rooney & RVP have completed on one hand.

That trend has continued with RVP & Falcao

The midfield is taking a large part of the blame but all I would say is IF Falcao had taken a few of his chances then the dynamic of the match changes.

Trying to break a team down is always difficult, doing it with two slow forwards is making it harder...BUT it would be far easier to create chances at 1-0 than it has been at 0-0 or 1 nil down.

6959~~~
I have to agree the service the forwards are getting is absolutely shocking. If your constantly moving to into space and no ones got the quality to pick you out, naturally you think it's easier to hit a still one than a moving target or to drop deep to get the easier ball. Trust me if Falcao was wearing a chelsea shirt, he'd be on double figures already. There are no issues with Cesc, William et al finding Costa. Even Ronaldo would fail in this setup. Di Maria is looking like Young pre LVG

6960~~~
You're absolutely right. I see Costa struggling at United. It will only take Falcao moving on to a proper team that can provide service to show his doubters how wrong they are. I specifically remember LVG instructing Falcao to drop deep in an FA cup game and I remember RVP getting only 13 touches one game. Shocking how poor we are in this respect. No wonder no one has hit double figures and no wonder we haven't won a single fvcking penalty this season

6961~~~
Its incredibly hard to provide service to a striker when you know you can't play any kind of through ball too, or can't slightly over hit a pass too. Everything has to be on a plate for Falcao, because he simply doesn't have any acceleration left in him.

6962~~~
Would like to hear from match-going fans on this one. Buddy of mine saw the Spurs game in London and said Falcao was making runs and getting frustrated by the lack of service. I didn't see this watching on TV. 

Is this something you see as well?   Is Falcao making runs and dropping deeper because he's not getting the ball in dangerous areas?

6963~~~
I don't see the correlation between not having service and being unable to control a football.

6964~~~
And he's missed a lot of the chances he has had, let's not forget. The latest being yesterdays.

He could easily turn it around, but at the moment there's blatantly a lot of special pleading being made on his behalf, just because he's 'Falcao'.

6965~~~
People overstate his pace and acceleration before his injury. He's never been a speed merchant. RVP has never been a pacy player, RVN was never a pacy player either.  Falcao is no slouch though, and he still gets into good positions

6966~~~
Exactly. Lots of people saying that Falcao and Van Persie aren't the problem, the service is, but both have missed a lot of good chances this season too. The service obviously isn't as good as it should be but they deserve at least half of the blame too.

6967~~~
This. Nothing excuses the huge number of sitters he and RVP missed in all the games they played in.

6968~~~
Forgot this... Yeah he's fecked. Unless he gets 26 goals in 14 games plus a few fa cup games.

6969~~~
I don't really care what he was like. Right now, he's probably one of the slowest strikers in the PL. He has no acceleration at all, its like he's running in treacle. Its a major issue, especially in the Premier League.

RVP was never Usain Bolt either, but he was certainly quicker then he is now. Plus, playing with one slow striker is manageable, playing with two in a diamond, is almost impossible.

6970~~~
I couldn't disagree more esp with regards to yesterdays game. His movement I thought was non existent.

6971~~~
Agree with this.

I bet the two of them are near unplayable in 5 asides and smaller games, but we can't go on playing both, as exciting as the prospect of it felt early season.

But then I think it'd really hurt the top brass to have a quarter of a million quid sitting on the bench each week.

We need to make the most of it, steal top 4, thank Falcao and wish him well, and think again.

VP and Robben worked well in the world cup, so I can see why he tried VP and Di Maria for a bit, but Falcao and VP doesn't really work, except against smaller teams at home we'd beat whatever.

6972~~~
Thing is, he's actually getting chances every match and he's missing them! The way you're talking it would suggest a sentiment of, "give him chances and he'll score", but he's getting chances, and he's missing them! 

His first touch is literally bordering on Championship level and his movement is, imo, no better than Javier Hernandez - at best it's marginally better. 

Do I think Costa would be doing better than Falcao in this United team? Yes, absolutely.

I think Ings, Austin, Kane or Berahino would all be doing notably better in this same United team.

More tellingly (or surreally depending on your view), I think Wayne Rooney would be doing far better than Falcao or RvP if played up top...

6973~~~

6974~~~
Bad form. Thats all. I said it earlier. Every player goes through it, unfortunately its at a really bad time for him, but the tactics are not helping. Costa wouldn't see as much of the ball in this team

6975~~~
If I was Wayne Rooney I would be seriously p....d that I am not playing up front, RVP and Falcao are just not working, Wilson is a mile away from the first team, and to make things worse plan 'B' seems to be either through ADM (pace) or Fellaini (height) into the mix, our BEST striker is Rooney. FFS play the best players, but in their best positions.

6976~~~
Thank Christ for slow motion replays for beefing that up

6977~~~
It's mental, truly and utterly mental. If I was Rooney, at this point in my career, I'd leave in the summer.

Credit to him for just going along with the madness.

That said, I believe he's going along with it at the detriment of his own career, so perhaps it shouldn't be lauded, I'm not sure.

6978~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6979~~~
It seems you wouldn't mind Rooney doing what he's tried to do twice already in his United career

6980~~~
I'm not pro Falcao any more than pro any other player but just common sense beyond the Falcao debate. Look at Di Maria, no one can question that he came here on form, injury free. We paid 60m for the lad and look at his performances. This is simply more than RVP or Falcao's form. The flair players are forcing it, and I think LVG is overthinking it. Players don't know what the feck they are doing anymore......

6981~~~
Well, I don't want him to leave. I think he's great.

I just meant that in all honesty, if I was a 29 year old striker who was the best striker in my squad and was being played regularly as a CM - rapidly becoming a DM - I'd leave at the first opportunity I got.

If he was 25, fair enough, but this is his final glory years as a striker and he's wasting his time deep in midfield.

Rooney and Wilson/RvP/Mata up top with a midfield of Valencia, Carrick, Herrera and ADM should be our week in - week out formation imo.

It's gotten to the point of bizarreness what we're doing with our team. It's almost like a weird dream or something. It's as if it's SO far from common sense that it's actually confused people beyond obvious critique.

6982~~~
And I'd let him go. If he was even considering it then he should give it serious thought because there isn't going to be a queue of top teams offering him the untouchable status he has here.

6983~~~
The first  10 or 20 pages of this thread are now legendary.

6984~~~
feck off <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

So much promise though! Only to be left with a sour taste.. I'm not even angry anymore!

6985~~~
So many posts about how quick he is...woops.

6986~~~
RVP is our best striker. Not Rooney

HERE HERE!

6987~~~
The Atleti videos were probably the worst tease for you guys. As were the Ac Milan Shevva compilations in 2007.

6988~~~
I disagree with that personally.

Wayne Rooney has been played out of position all season and has 8 PL goals. RvP has been played as CF all season and has 9...

6989~~~
RVP has been our top scorer for two seasons running. Since he joined us. He's been better than Rooney.

6990~~~
It looks as though you were right all along about Falcao, which is... annoying.

6991~~~
You've made the 6th most posts in a thread for a player that doesn't even play for you. Did Falcao fondle your mum or something?

That said, it's probably the most excited I've been about a United transfer. Was totally blinkered about his injury/decline and hoped that we'd see him at his Atletico/Porto best. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6992~~~
Like I said, I disagree with that. Last season Rooney scored 5 more PL goals and had 9 more assists.

This season he's one behind despite being played as a midfielder while RvP enjoys 90 minutes as a striker every game.

Rooney also has double RvP's assists this season.

So going by form over what is now approaching 2 years, Rooney has been the more productive player by far.

6993~~~
That's all well and good but RVP's game as he has got older is to be on the end of play. Rooney's is often as a creator, set piece taker or second striker. Therefore RVP's assists will mainly be to set Rooney up. Rooney's assists could be anybody else in support of the striker. Even more so as a midfielder now with 2 strikers who have their back to the defender mostly.

I'm not arguing with you, just providing context beyond the stats. For what it's worth, I'd try benching RVP and having Rooney off Falcao up front for the Burnley game. Especially given their porous defence and lack of height.

6994~~~
Rooney is a good striker with good end product (shite footballer these days). Im not saying he's bad, but the record will support the fact that RVP has been the better striker these last two seasons. Both of them don't have control of where the manager chooses to play them.

6995~~~
Im only right about things when I dont put money on it! By the way do you guys sitll  play?

6996~~~
Rooney is doing exactly what he is supposed to do, average goals and assists in double figures every season despite not being our main striker and help the team with his workrate, RVP on the other hand was signed to be our main man upfront a job he executed perfectly in his first year, he scored only 13 goals last season but he was out injured so it is understandable, this year however, he has scored only 9 goals for us which is very poor for the main striker of a top team, for the last 2 seasons, Rooney has been a better attacking player than RVP, he wasn't our top scorer but he was just 2 goals short of RVP last season which isn't significant at all, as far as this season is concerned Rooney has produced more MOTM performances than RVP, he has more goals and assists than RVP this season and he hasn't played in the Centre forward position.. i understand the need to stand by RVP after his first season, but the truth of the matter is he isn't the RVP of 2 seasons ago and we need a top striker, the mere fact that you are comparing him to Rooney who doesn't play the CF role and his stats aren't significantly higher is a good enough reason for us to start searching for a top quality striker.

People have recently been mentioning his work rate as a reason to keep him, i don't refute that at all, he has improved his performances this season but if he isn't scoring goals, isn't he just a rich man's Danny Welbeck?

6997~~~
Shevchenko,Ronaldo (fat),Torres and now Falcao...

6998~~~
???

6999~~~
By all means let's get a top forward. RVP is getting up there in age anyway. He's scored more than Rooney this season though. Rooney has 8

7000~~~
I bet you can count them with one finger though

7001~~~
Agree, Rooney is the best finisher we have. RVP converts half-chances more but misses the easy ones all too often and I don't think he's as reliable a header as Rooney.  One on one, I'd back Rooney to score more than anyone else in the team.

Falcao was supposed to do it all <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

7002~~~
combined, i meant combined

7003~~~
They all suddenly forgot how to score

7004~~~
Nope hes has played there vs Swansea Sunderland Burnley and Southampton away and was poor. I'd like him to play up top though as he'll be more mobile but I'm not expecting miracles. He'd be miles better than Falcao though of course.

7005~~~
I meant 1 hand ... oh God, 1 finger<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7006~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7007~~~
Totally agree.

7008~~~
We simply cannot play RVP and Falcao up front together against anyone half decent. It's like playing with 9 men. One or the other.

7009~~~
Red alert?

Not recently, I've been too busy! I will tag you whenever I get back into it though.

7010~~~
So what happens once we decide we're not buying him? Will he be benched for the rest of the season?

7011~~~
He will be vital against teams like Chelsea,City and Arsenal

7012~~~
Please elaborate.

7013~~~
He knows how to hustle for the ball, and against the big teams who aren't conservative he will be provided with more space to penetrate, well thats if Chelsea don't park the bus.

7014~~~
Well I agree but that's all about the theory. There was a lot of teams who were not conservative against us at all, and we didn’t manage to hurt them anyway.

That’s not the point though, I just wonder what will happen to him LvG decides he’s gone in the summer. So far he seems to be a starter.

7015~~~
To penetrate? He's as slow as a snail. He won't be bursting into any open space anytime soon.

7016~~~
I feel like LVG is basically playing both strikers to squeeze as much goals out from them as he possibly can, and sometimes it works, despite their mediocre performances .. RVP and Falcao still manage to get lucky goals or assists, it also doesn't help that our midfielders haven't been consistent as a unit, leaving people to question their abilities to supply the strikers with good balls, i feel like if our midfielders step up and become consistent then LVG would have to demote one of the strikers to the bench.

7017~~~
He isn't slow, at least not in every game, granted he looked very slow against West Ham but that was just a bad game, he wasn't slow against Leicester infact he was able to score because of his pace, he can be quite fast off the ball aswell, if you watch the highlights of our previous games you would see that.

7018~~~
His woeful first touch isn't just post injury rustiness. This is from his last season with Atléti:

7019~~~
Would be interesting to see a poll now on if we should keep him or not.

7020~~~

7021~~~
Looked like he had aged a bit in the West Ham game, now we have proof.

7022~~~
When they are both on form I would agree, but RVP looks like a player in decline, Rooney gives 100% (most of the time) and would relish a striking role again-----let him loose on Burnley an see !

7023~~~
Which shows that it's not really a detriment to his game. How many goals did he score in that season?

7024~~~
He's lost pace since that season/injury though, and that <i>is</i> making a difference to the chances he gets on the end of.

And when you're already not the fastest, losing that half a yard and then turning up at the PL perhaps in hindsight isn't the wisest move.

His shooting also seems far less powerful than it previously was, though perhaps I'm wrong on that.

7025~~~
He scored 28 that season. 8 were penalties.

7026~~~
Penamel Falcao.

7027~~~
We now have a version of that Falcao, who with a fraction of the goals has the same shitty first touch.  
He was the focal point of that team. It was a team set up to supply him (then Costa when he left). He won't ever be that here given he's probably got another three months or so of playing second fiddle to RvP. We can't expect that horrific first touch to improve. Yet the balance of our team can improve by dropping Falcao who is unlikely to be here next season, putting our captain back in his favoured position (behind RvP) and playing an actual midfielder (or Fellaini <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>) with Blind in midfield.

7028~~~
Well, it doesn't help. Especially seeing as he has since lost his place and isn't taking his chances.

7029~~~
I'd play Falcao ahead of RVP on this season's form. It's tricky, though. He's not looked worth the 40m to sign him permanently so we probably need to focus on a future without him. I also think we should focus on a future without RvP but that's a whole new can of worms. Where does he go and who do we replace him with? Feck knows the answer to those questions so might as well keep playing him for now.

7030~~~
If he has lost his pace I'm sure the club are aware. They'll have metrics. The finishing will come once he starts playing with confidence again. Time is running out though. Of course, it will be a pain in the hole if he starts banging them in again for someone else next season.

7031~~~
It will be of course, but we can only judge on what he does for us this season. And so far it's very far off being enough.

7032~~~
I have a nasty feeling we will sign him regardless of how he does in the next few months.

7033~~~
van Gaal must already know that we aren't going to sign him. I feel like I already know it. I've also accepted that despite van Persie's shortcomings he has one quality which means LvG wont drop him, and that's his hold up play. I can't be bothered to dig out the quotes but I'm pretty sure LvG described him as a 'focal point' or something earlier in the season and talked about his ability to bring team mates into play. Rooney and Falcao don't hold up the ball as well which is why Falcao tends to play as the deeper of the two (despite RvPs all round play being better imo). But as we are unlikely to be keeping him next season and the fact that RvP is undroppable to LvG (rightly or wrongly) I'd rather we cut our losses and play the best balanced team. 

I agree with you on planning for a future without both. I'm sure LvG is thinking similarly given his attempt to play Di Maria up top for his pace, even though I was a bit annoyed with that as he was the one who sanctioned the sale of Welbeck (our pace up front).

7034~~~
I'd rather give Wilson game time ahead of Falcao to try and see if he has it.

Falcao just isn't going to work. A failed experiment.

7035~~~
I think his price might be renegotiated down in the summer. I wouldn't mind him for £25million ish, mostly due to the fact there isn't really anyone better we could realistically get, but many believe we don't need another striker anyway and wouldn't bother replacing him.

7036~~~
There's probably about 20 strikers better in the PL alone, surely we could get at least half of them?

7037~~~
Well that's not true, The only strikers better than Falcao in the prem are Aguero, Costa, RVP, Strurridge?, Kane(Should I be mentioning him?), Rooney and other then maybe Kane, I can't see us getting any of them.

Even West Brom apparently want £22million for Berahino lol

7038~~~
If we're talking 'old' Falcao, then yes. But this current version, well sadly there are tons of better strikers right now (some not particularity special themselves either in all honesty).  The likes of Berahino, Ings, Austin, Remy, Sterling, Giroud, Pelle just off the top of my head are all playing at a much much higher level then Falcao. Even Defoe has come back into the league and already scored 2 goals.

7039~~~
Don't send him any cake.

7040~~~
Which old Falcao? He was a europa league star, not a CL great. He's in his late twenties and didn't play for a really big club, and the Spanish club he played for had it's biggest succes without him, as did his national team. 

That's not really surprising because it's a 'high maintenance' striker. He needs a lot of service, and contributes little to the service to others. 20 goals is not really a lot for a striker who's only job is to run for his own chances and score goals. His first touch statistic shows his technique isn't that great. It has always been very optimistic to think of him as a world class striker with adequate hold-up play. It's the kind of striker who looks very good when one watches clips of his goals.

7041~~~
Its going to be a short clip collection for us.

7042~~~
Ando knicked them all when he left.

7043~~~
That's the thing, though. This Falcao simply isn't as effective as even someone like Berahino. We can hope that he might suddenly burst into life, but right now there are a lot of players who are much more effective than him. Off the top of my head I honestly don't think we'd be at all worse off if we had any one of:

Remy
Welbeck
Dzeko
Jovetic
Pelle
Sahko
Valencia
Lukaku

and that's without even mentioning the really good strikers. Pedigree is all well and good, but without performances it's not worth much.

7044~~~
Anderson was a BMI-challenged <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7045~~~
Austin, Berahino, Remy, Pelle, Dzecko, Welbeck, Sahko, Ings, Giroud,  are all better strikers at present.

7046~~~
Maybe I have too many memories of his game vs us and general Atletico  goals. I always had him down as a world class striker though, and stand by that sentiment of his Porto and Atletico days.

7047~~~
I wouldn't change Falcao for Lukaku. He was brilliant first half last season, but this season, he's been like a version of Heskey. Big target man without technique or flair. Falcao got both flair and technique. 

We don't create enough chances. I don't feel that's Falcaos or RvPs fauls alone. They had a few decent combinations against West Ham. I expect more from them, but I also expected more from the likes of Di Maria, Rooney and Januzaj.

7048~~~
Yeah I didnt include Lukaku, im not convinced by him at all. He does something Drogba-esque once every blue moon and then has shockers the rest of the time.

7049~~~
World class strikers don't play for Porto and Atletico. He often made the impression that he could become a world class striker, but for that he would need be consistently solid in his touches and finishing.

7050~~~
He definitely was a world class striker, I can't understand how poor his finishing has been though. Even if his legs have gone I'd still expect him to bury his chances as it usually comes naturally. There are some games where he'll literally get no service but I'm just not confident he'll score if he's played through. He was obviously nervous to impress early on but it isn't an excuse for every game. 

Earlier on in the season I was worried that we'd let him go and he'd bang the goals in for another English club, but to be honest I hope one of them pays his buyout because he's completely finished.

7051~~~
That's just a ridiculous argument. First of all because it would mean Diego Costa wssn't world class until this season (so why did Chelsea sign him?) but also because if you're judging players purely by who they play for, Falcao is currently playing for Manchester United. So that means he definitely is world class, right?

7052~~~
Hopefully he won’t start tonight but the manager does seem intent on pairing him with RVP and given the opposition I imagine it is pretty much guaranteed he willt. 

I don’t think it is fair to dismiss what he did in the past and to undermine what a good player he was but the simple fact is he isn’t even half the player he was. His touch was never great and his strength isn’t as big an asset or as noticeable in the Premier League as it was at his previous clubs, add that to the loss of pace, the fact he can never seem to get his feet sorted when he needs to adjust quickly and his poor finishing and what you are left with is a very ordinary player with big wages and a big reputation. I admire his effort but when that is the best thing you can say about a player like him it says everything.

There are two huge errors we need to avoid this summer if we are going to start moving forward, the first would be sacking the manager and being under prepared for the transfer window (if he is replaced we would need someone straight away who doesn’t need time to assess) and the second is signing Falcao. Whether the price is £10m, £20m or £40m we need to steer clear and there shouldn’t even be a discussion about whether we sign him or not.

7053~~~
Totally agree.

7054~~~
Why exactly can't a player in Spain be considered a world class talent?

7055~~~
So Torres, Forlan, Aguero, Falcao, Costa - never world class? OK.

Some people really do get caught up in the self-hype of the Premier League.

7056~~~
It's probably the same daft logic that means a Tottenham player can't be good enough for United. 
Like Modric wasn't for ages... And Bale...

7057~~~
And now Kane...

7058~~~
Another big chance tonight, I don't know if its worth it any more. Its costing the team, especially when you have RvP as his partner.

7059~~~
Good management from LVG to start him again. Hopefully he will have a good game.

7060~~~
I have a feeling he'll do well tonight shit as he has been so far.

7061~~~
He'll score another crappy goal.

7062~~~
If he scores tonight he beats Shevchenko's rotten record of 4 in 30 in the league. Not that it's any consolation or anything... He literally has to improve every aspect of his game between now and the end of the season and score in most of them to have a chance of staying I reckon.

7063~~~
Even if he does, what will we say? "Scored a brace against Burnley"... there's no argument to keep in him the starting lineup that I can see right now.

7064~~~
Can he at least hold the fecking ball up for once?

7065~~~
Looked way out of his depth again. Assist though, right? stats stats stats.

7066~~~
He earns over 200k a week but can't afford a glue.

7067~~~
Smalling now only a goal behind our "World Class" Striker

7068~~~
His first touch is awful.

7069~~~
Ive said this before but, his first touch is bloody awful

7070~~~
I've been a huge defender of his, but he's been abysmal this half, laughably so! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7071~~~
It's gotta be something to do with Mendes.

Literally the only reason I can see that he keeps playing is so Mendes doesn't get pissed off and take De Gea to Madrid.

Doesn't explain why Van Persie keeps playing as well though. Perhaps that's Woodward and the rest of the board because he's on over £200k a week.

7072~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Dammit Bojan!

7073~~~
We should signed Rivière from Monaco <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>, he was after all their main man last season.

7074~~~
Sold his touch to the devil, or something.

7075~~~
Really awful in his hold up play.

7076~~~
Absoutely gutted he is performing like he is.

7077~~~
Seems to have got dispossessed everytime he's got the ball

7078~~~
He doesn't deserve to start, really should be on the bench

7079~~~
He's wank, period. Get rid please, one of the most average strikers we've got in recent years.

7080~~~
Laughable that a player who was considered by most people one of the best strikers out there can't even control simple balls.

7081~~~
Be fair though, he's fighting for scraps every game along side a partner that is ridiculously selfish and trying to save his own career. 

He's trying way too fecking hard every every game because he knows he's on last legs here. 

Any other club with good service to the front line and he's scoring. 

Feel sorry for the bloke to be honest

7082~~~
I agree with this. How is this guy starting games for us? He's awful.

Rooney sitting in DM meanwhile. It's surreal!

7083~~~
It was worth a go with the loan - try to get the man who has one of the best strike rates in Europe back to his best. 

It's not worked out, it shows no signs of working out and Mendes can advertise him elsewhere and make some money. Can we just stop with this two paceless striker rubbish now?

7084~~~
Cringeworthy performance so far. Worst hold-up play i've ever seen. Hopefully he improves or is subbed in the next half.

7085~~~
Well, never good to post at half time really. Emotions high and all that. But that was amongst the worst first half performances Iv seen by a United player in recent seasons.

7086~~~
Terrible first half. Absolutely terrible.

7087~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's so, so bad at the moment.

7088~~~
He's played awfully. Non existent first touch and muscled off the ball so easily. Yet he's still playing better than Van Persie who looks like he couldn't give a shit,

7089~~~
A player who seems very low on confidence. Can't even do the simple things like hold up the ball or control it. Quite shocking to be fair.

One of the main reasons we keep getting pinned in our half by burnley. Might be time to drop him because playing this diamond is causing us to play shit football. All this to accommodate two very similar strikers.

7090~~~
He got an assist though, stats! Someone better tell luckyspurs. Goes to show how stats barely tell the whole story.

7091~~~
Just hope he get benched until the end of the season

Rvp has to work twice more for this bullet

Shame we cant send him back to Monaco

7092~~~
Wilson deserves a run ahead of him right now.

7093~~~
That's just stupid. 2nd goal came because of Van Persie's initial run and pass. Also, his hold up touch etc are much better. Falcao has lost the ball a gazillion times already

7094~~~
I'm pretty sure he wouldn't get into Burnley's team right now.

7095~~~
I'd rather pay £43m for Danny Ings.

7096~~~
Is he being booed?

7097~~~
I think so. That's not okay for me, you can't fault his effort. It's not his fault that he's past it, LVG just needs to stop playing him.

7098~~~
Just send him back to Monaco please. Finished.

7099~~~
By the Burnley fans, I think.

7100~~~
Stop it... It was the Burnley fans who booed him.

7101~~~
Do you know why? <a class="username" data-user="77836, @Woodenlung" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/77836/">@Woodenlung</a>

7102~~~
I like the guy, and he's clearly not remotely getting the service he needs, but it's fair to say it's not going to work out for him here at this point. I'd rather we didn't have the headache of his selection, 'cos sacrificing our two most creative midfielders for the sake of getting two 30 year olds into the same position makes absolutely no sense.

If he can pop up with a Balotelli-like winner in a big game (or indeed any game) at some point, I'll be chuffed.

7103~~~
What did they chant when he came off?

7104~~~
"What a waste of money", Burnley fans again, they are correct though.

7105~~~
Edit: wrong thread.

7106~~~
Seems a lovely chap. Good family man. At one point was the best striker in the world. No reason to dislike him whatsoever.

But he is useless on the pitch for us and none of the above should have any bearing to him making the teamsheet.

We all want it to work out, but it's not going to do.

7107~~~
Forearmed one of their players in the back of the head when challenging a high ball.

7108~~~
My thoughts exactly.

7109~~~
He needs to be dropped.

7110~~~
This I'm afraid, been desperate for him to score and tear shit up but it doesn't look like it's going to happen.

7111~~~
When he runs, he looks like he's holding in a massive poo. He looks utterly uncomfortable, all of the time.

7112~~~
It's not working. He's had enough chances now.

Rather play Wilson, Fellaini, Mata and Herrera ahead of him.

7113~~~
Yeah, he's clearly not the player he used to be. Disappointing, but it looks like this will be a failed "project."

7114~~~
Thank feck we got him on loan!

It would be devastating if we'd shelled out the full fee when he's clearly a shadow of the player he used to be.

Still think he might answer a few critics in the close to the season but too little too late.

7115~~~
rather wilson up front that him at the moment. Could not hold up anything and doesn't have enough pace to stretch the defenders.

7116~~~
No he isn't. Biggest myth this season.

7117~~~
Needs to play much higher up the pitch and needs width. RVP didn't do much more. I'm sure Falcao would have scored the pen too. I think sadly, they cannot play together. We're lacking quality width. Feel for the lad. He's under crazy pressure and I think he's not being helped by the way we're playing. We need more pace and direction in this team. Is he worth the price? No, but I wouldn't jump to the conclusion he's finished.

7118~~~
I know, apparently being unable to control a simple pass is "better" than RVP. Not true at all. His finishing has been awkward as anything too. Just looks like he's lost all of his ability and confidence.

7119~~~
It's funny how people want RVP dropped for him, on the basis of what? If RVP isn't scoring, he'll atleast be fine with hold up play. Falcao makes so many misplaced passes, can't even control the ball at times, it's clear why LVG wasn't keen to play him but people always think they know better than managers.

7120~~~
Reminiscent of shevchenko/torres at chelsea - although those two mainly missed chances but their overall play was good. Falcao plays like he's been training with a balloon since his last knee injury. The amount of times the ball bounces over his head etc is ridiculous.

7121~~~
Falcao got the assist for the first goal. Goes to show that you should really judge a player's performance by more than just a couple of seconds.

7122~~~
Was woeful today. Was shite vs West Ham because of his finishing I thought but his hold up play was generally pretty good. Non existant today though, everything bounced off him. Got an assist but that's about the only useful thing he did all game. 

Feel for him as he's clearly trying and wants to do well, he's just not that good anymore IMO. Lost some pace, got weaker, not as good in the air be it strength wise or jumping, just poor all around.

7123~~~
I still refuse to beleive he's finished as a player, he just seems absolutely bereft of confidence.

7124~~~
What? Van Persie can actually control the ball and given the nonexistent midfield, I'm not surprised he seems a bit careless at times. Even when Van Persie doesn't seen to care, he's one of our better players. That's how bad we are at the moment.

7125~~~
Started 2 home games against the bottom 2; to be honest I wouldn't have been satisfied with anything but back to back hit-tricks!

But seriously, so so awful tonight - especially first touch and hold up play.  On the day his face was shown on the papers after the new Premier League deal for earning 380K per week while Premier League clubs aren't paying the Living wage.

7126~~~
This. But can't see us shelling out £45m on this guy now unfortunately. Wish he settled better but LVGs tactics do him no favours at all, he's playing in a team that doesn't play to his strengths its that simple. Feel sorry for him.

7127~~~
Can't play with another striker, can't hold the ball up well enough to play up front on his own. It's still really difficult to give him to much grief because he isn't getting any chances at all.
Carries on like this and Mendes is going to have to show how good an agent he is to find a buyer. No team will even consider his at 20m never mind 40m+ that we have been quoted. He has been horrendous this season. Needs dropping.

7128~~~
I saw Ings play today.
I'd much rather Ings play for us, than Falcao.
Falcao, just isnt good enough to play for Man Utd.
For his own career, I think he should go back to Athletico Madrid. Like Torres, he might be able to rekindle his career.

The stats:
A.Madrid, 68 apps,  52 goals , 0.76 goals per game.
Man Utd, 15 apps, 4 goals, 0.27 goals per game

7129~~~
The only thing in his favor I can say is I have more confidence for him in big games than the likes of Burnley. It's more of a problem on his part still as he can't get in behind compact defensive structures, he can't hold the ball up and he isn't getting close to looking a goal threat but in a more open game he many benefit from the space on the counter. Even then he shouldn't start though. Just hypothetically those chances against Chelsea where we exploited the space suit him better than RvP.

7130~~~
Lack of confidence doesn't explain him being terribly slow and weak. He's just completely useless, because he actually doesn't have one single attribute to make him any good. Injuries have destroyed him and he is finished as a player. Shame, because I used to really like him pre-Monaco and he is quite likable.

7131~~~
He is absolutely useless at the moment. If we even attempt to sign him in the summer I'm going to go insane.

Never knew a player could have a first touch so incredibly shit.

7132~~~
To be honest, I reckon he and RVP are going to be shipped this summer....

7133~~~
A player doesn't lose ALL ability because of an injury, his leg didn't fall off.

7134~~~
I wonder what that long discussion him, Rooney and the ref had, maybe the ref was trying to figure out why Falcao is up top instead of Rooney or if he was checking with Rooney that Falcao was actually meant to be playing or had snuck on the pitch as a day visitor guest.

7135~~~
You would say that.

7136~~~
Could be the game that seals it for LVG. Abysmal performance. Second touch was a tackle 90% of the time and didn't get into any good positions.

7137~~~
His first touch is as heavy as a truck, it's terrible to watch. My river froze up a few times when he got the ball and I just knew he would lose it.

7138~~~
Was his first touch not so special before his injury? Or is the devastation of trapping a common effect of his injury? It's ridiculous how loose his control is for the calibre of player he was meant to be.

7139~~~
That's the issue for me. I really wanted it to work out for him, but he's offering next to nothing at the moment.

7140~~~
No big worries. He's loaned to the rest of the season so there's still time for him to do something positive.

After that it will be matter of one, quick decision by LVG.

7141~~~
Unfortunately doesn't look like the player of a couple of seasons ago. He may well have to look to prolong his career in a more forgiving league.

7142~~~
Imo he was one of our baddest performers today, couldn't keep hold of anything and doesn't have the pace required to run behind defenders.

He needs to have the team built around him like we did with RvP in his first season, get the ball to him in the box and he is probably lethal, but i think we should expect more of a United striker.

7143~~~
I remember at school, there was this lad who was an amazing player. Fast as hell, you couldnt get near him. Bigger than everyone else, shouldering all the lesser developed kids out of the way. Just an brilliant player. Always got picked first. In 2015, he had a game with us on the local field next to my house. He's really fat now. Slow, cant keep up. Chain smoker. Totally knackered. Like a totally different person.

I get the same sad feeling watching Falcao in a United shirt, after previously seeing him tearing it up in Europe. Its like watching Diego Forlan when he first signed for us.

7144~~~
Probably our most underwhelming signing since Anderson.

So much promise, delivered so little.

From now on I'd keep him on the bench as an impact sub, and get Rooney up front.*

<span style="color: #ffffff">*Who am I kidding, we'll probably stick with Falcao or have Wilson play there.</span>

7145~~~
Being physically bad makes his technique look worse which affects his confidence? It often works like that, but I just don't see any glimpses of Falcao from the past.

7146~~~
He did help set up one of Smalling's goals today. Not saying he is fulfilling expectations, but it's worth pointing out.

7147~~~
Radamel Torres.

7148~~~
Was he booed off tonight? I feel sorry for him. He seems like such a humble guy, who really looks like he loves the club and wants to do well. Unfortunately, it's not going too well for him.

7149~~~
Labored unimpressive performance.  Too many poor touches and getting muscled off the ball.  Not sure there will be improvement.  Need a better player up top for the remainder of the season.

7150~~~
The problem is that playing RVP and Falcao together has never worked and it has to stop. It has to be either one or the other and right now RVP offers a lot more. Falcao should be only used if RVP gets injured. Van Gaal is determined to prove everyone wrong about signing Falcao..but Falcao needs to be up front on his own at some other club and he will thrive again

7151~~~
When you lose to Michael Keane in a footchase, its time to look for something else to do with life.

7152~~~
He was booed off by Burnely fans for an elbow a couple of minutes before. Not by us.

7153~~~
that's not stupid that's closer to true than not.. RVP saved his reputation in the second half with a decent performance but apart that he is really awful this season in everything and really doesn't look like he cares. Always late everywhere and his hold up play is slowing the attack incredibly as he is unable to make a sharp turn.. today he was just about good in the second half and obviously better than Falcao who had really bad game..

7154~~~
He has been getting out muscled all season. This league is too much for him. The old Falcao is, we are seeing a shadow.

7155~~~
Has he ever been faster than his opponent?

7156~~~
You're making out he's like a sapling, he showed good strength a couple of times to hold the ball up, his touch was just shit. I'm convinced its all a confidence thing.

7157~~~
Seemed to be when he caught up and begun to overtake the Burnley defense when Di Maria broke away in the first half.

7158~~~
I think he'd probably look better up top on his own with some genuine width in the team, can't really imagine him and RvP will ever work out.

7159~~~
I cannot believe how badly Falcao's playing at the minute. Totally different player than the one that started the season. He may not have been at his best in the early outings for United. However, when he was setting up goals against Leicester and West Ham you could see he was a competent footballer. His touch was abysmal today, and he seemed to need two or three seconds to decide what he wanted to do with the ball every time. Worse, he made some decent runs but there were moments where we had the ball in wide areas where he just didn't commit. Falcao has the look of a player who thinks its over for him at United and is thinking 'why bother when I don't have a future here?' At the moment he doesn't deserve to be starting in one of the two advanced positions ahead of the likes of Rooney and Mata.

7160~~~
Did he get an assist or was I imagining things?

7161~~~
Header across goal for Smalling's first

7162~~~
Thanks.

7163~~~
He plays football as if his legs are made from lead. Can't run, can't control the ball. He's not even clinical in front of goal. Pointless.

7164~~~
Yep that comparison has been in my mind for a couple of weeks.

7165~~~
Yeah that was decent work. Only thing he's done in the whole game though

7166~~~
Feels like he's doing a Shevchenko.

7167~~~
At least Torres played to a decent level without getting the goals. Falcao when he runs looks like when you're late for the match and need to run across concrete pavement to get to the pitch at the far end but being shi* scared you're going to lose balance.

7168~~~
I dont want to see him in a United sihrt ever again , he is not worth the money we are shelling out on him , he is not even half the player he used to be.

7169~~~
It's got to the stage where I'm having to remind myself what he was ever good at.

He looks horribly out of his depth which is a crazy thing to say for someone who's done so much in the game.

7170~~~
Thought that too, but yeah I really feel for him. You can tell he really wants to do well and tries really hard, it's just not working for him and you can tell the frustration on his face. Also feel bad because he seems like a really likable guy but then I get annoyed whenever I see him starting alongside RvP and just keep hoping he'll be subbed.

3 ACL surgeries will do that to you though, hopefully he can get back to a good level next season but that won't be here most likely.

7171~~~
Good, both about as much use as a chocolate teapot, both way past their expiration dates wouldn't be shedding any tears if they left tommorow.

If we ever want to get back to the top we need to get these off the wages and shift deadweight like these and bring in talented youth, there's a fair few knocking about

7172~~~
Shevchenko Mark II. I'm a massive fan of Falcao and watching him in his prime was incredible. Those Europa League finals and that European Supercup against Chelsea, it doesn't get any better than that. But he's done. Completely finished. We can't continue to carry a player like that anymore on the off chance that he might just recapture some form. I feel sorry for him though. Well, as much as you can feel sorry for someone who earns ungodly amounts of money anyway.

7173~~~
It's over. No point in playing him anymore. Get games into Wilson or actually play Rooney in his best position. He can't even control the ball! Absolutely no point in loaning Hernandez or selling Welbeck looking at Falcao's performances. Surely LvG will drop him now? I just cannot fathom how he has kept starting despite being poor. Maybe now he has been atrocious van Gaal will wake up.

7174~~~
The good news is Mendes is his agent, so he'll pitch up at another big club and get a fortune to try the ball further than I can kick the bloody thing. Nice work if you can get it.

7175~~~
He looks like he's playing with a big bouncy ball compared to everyone else. He just couldn't control it to save his life. It's sad to see him so poor considering the great striker he used to be.

One thing is for sure. As much as we like him, there's no way we should sign him permanently. It doesn't make sense on any level. We're better off playing Rooney where he belongs and investing that money in midfield and another mobile striker who can handle this league.

7176~~~
After this "performance" tonight, I would be baffled if Falcao ever starts a match again in a Manchester United shirt. Of all the strikers who hit a low that is beyond any chance for redemption, it's the lowest I have seen in years.

7177~~~
Was he really that bad tonight? MOTD highlights dont really give you a picture.

7178~~~
Let's put it this way: He's lucky he's not a horse.  Because if he was-he'd be on his way to the glue factory.

7179~~~
See I thought he was even worse in our last match and he still started against Burnely so I have no doubt he's got plenty of more game time in the legs.

7180~~~
The way people talk about him on this page compared to the first few, I don't think i've ever seen such a polar opposite. What happened today that was so bad?

7181~~~
He was pretty useless. Horrible first touch, bullied by the defenders and barely threatened Burnley. Though he did assist Smalling's first goal.

7182~~~
Falcao was atrocious tonight. He couldn't control a ball, he appears to now have the touch of a high schooler.
He looks so clumsy when he tries to run fast and he just doesn't seem to be the player he once was in every department.
Both he and rvp should be off in the summertime and let's get in fresh blood.

I was one of falcaos biggest fans but he is clearly not the same after the acl issues. I wish him the best at his new club next season, he does seem like a nice guy tho.

7183~~~
Footballing genocide.

7184~~~
As it turns out he's no improvement on Hernandez.

7185~~~
Imagine Javier Hernandez but slower and without the finishing.

7186~~~
One goal ahead of Smalling in terms of assists, one goal ahead of Mata in terms of assists.

7187~~~
This is actually sad because I remember somebody saying he's Hernandez only with better technique and two good feet.

7188~~~
He was bad enough today against Burnley that he should never play for us again.  Wilson has a long way to go but I would rather give him chances than waste our time with Falcao.  This is a man well past it.

7189~~~
He and Van Persie just ran under one another's feet, the difference being that Van Persie had control of his. Genuinely saw Falcaos head fall off tonight and I don't think he should start against Swansea. 
Might do him good to be pulled but his control of the football was horrible tonight and despite any of that he usually keeps his head up, tonight it not only went down but came off altogether.

7190~~~
Surely Wilson has to get a more game time now. Even if he makes a heap of rookie mistakes he can't be any worse then Falcao has been.

7191~~~
Reminds me of an even worse version of Michael Owen at United, if that's even possible.

7192~~~
He would be able to cope better in Serie A.  The problem is his wages, I don't think any Serie A club even Juventus can pay his wages without obliterating their wage structure.   He very well might be stuck in Monaco.

7193~~~
Looks laboured and has the touch of a lead pipe. He also shouldn't be played alongside RVP the two of em just don't work they want to make similar runs all the time and it looks cluttered. He'd looked better played on his own as there's been moments of good movement but he doesn't warrant a starting place with his performances.

Bench em, 

RVP up top on his own with whatever bat-shit crazy concoction you can come up with bringing up the rear please Louis.

7194~~~
Still time for him to improve his game. Not gonna lose faith in him yet, I'll wait until the end of the season before making a judgement.

7195~~~
Sad as he's such a lovable guy too.

If he started banging in goals he would be 70% of the fans favourite player.

7196~~~
I can't even understand this.

He's shown literally no improvement whatsoever since he came here. His performances haven't changed, at all.

I think this is it. Every so often, much like Torres he might produce a decent goal or bit of play and everyone will say he's back but I really don't see him improving anymore.

How can you have such blind faith and not trust what you can clearly see with your eyes?

7197~~~
Because I have nothing to lose by doing so. Stop being so melodramatic.

7198~~~
Reality is finally starting to kick in, he's unfortunately not the striker he once was.

Waste of money chants were harsh because if we had him 2 years ago and he was never injured, we'd potentially be talking about the new Ruud and it's not like he's not trying. It's just the fact that he's simply not what he was in Atletico.

I still think he has a role to play this season and I'm glad we tried this loan move. It's not a matter of us thinking "what if"

7199~~~
It's not being melodramatic, it's being realistic.

Believing he's gonna come good in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary is like believing pigs fly. Stupid.

7200~~~
I'd give him a game as the lone striker with someone like Mata or Herrera behind him to see if that gets him going. He's likely used to playing as the lone striker all his career that it almost seems strange for him to struggle so badly.

7201~~~
That wouldn't explain why he can't control a football and wouldn't help with the fact he's now slower than Van Gaal probably is at running.

7202~~~
That was incredibly painful to watch.  I feel sorry for him, he tries but his body is done.

7203~~~
Some of the lost balls happened when he was even under minimal pressure from opponents.

7204~~~
Falcao's strengths usually are his body control, work ethic and anticipation so starting him with some familiar set up would help, he never really beat people for pace even at his best.

7205~~~
I'm well aware but he was much quicker than this.

His body control and anticipation are also completely shot.

7206~~~
He's not even 1/3rd of what Owen was here. 

The Fan boy in me still wants him to go play the next match and be the old Falcao, score a hattrick but it just wont happen. He's finished isn't he?

7207~~~
He makes Chicha look like a world beater. We should pull the plug on this experiement in the summer.

7208~~~
What does he do?

7209~~~
Only thing stopping Wilson from starting ahead of Falcao is Falcao's reputation

7210~~~
it is disappointing...since I really like him as a person. Just wish it was working out. I mean, is all hope lost?

7211~~~
He's slow, has a bad first touch, can't hold it up and his movement in the box has been poor. If he could do any one of those things I'd understand LvG's insistence on playing him. At the moment he provides nothing.

He's our fifth best striker right now, imo (Rooney, RvP, Fellaini, Wilson being the other 4). The others could make some kind of tactical sense depending on circumstances. Falcao makes none.

7212~~~
We were smart when we did the loan deal. Now we should benefit from our foresight and <i>not</i> sign him.

I really like him. He seems to be a nice guy and he seems to try hard, nevertheless... the experiment failed. Honestly, there are not many reasons why we should sign him even for 30 mio. We could bring Chicarito back - a player who gave us better performances and costs us nothing.

Falcao got his chances. And he should still get a few chances, but personally I would prefer Van Persie and Wilson from now on in the starting eleven. 

The whole thread should be renamed in "Falcao - sad but true".

7213~~~
Yeah, I'm disappointed but I really don't see many reasons to keep him here. 
I like him as person, he works hard but well it's not enough. 

Best of luck in his next club.

7214~~~
I think Van Gaal is playing him to make absolutely certain he's a busted flush before calling it quits. He'd look like a melon if he gave up on Falcao a bit hastily (post injury, in a new league) only for him to look immense at a different club next season. Hopefully the experiment is over now though. He's just not improving and he's had a fair few games to do so. 

In my more paranoid moments I also wonder if he'a keeping Mendes sweet until De Gea's signed on the dotted line. Especially after his bleating when Falcao got dropped earlier on this season. He's Mendes' golden goose. Available for a massive signing on fee, with no transfer fee. Doesn't get better than that for an agent. Will lose Mendes a LOT of money if Falcao is seen as a flop.

7215~~~
As a big fan of Falcao, it hurts me to say this, but he's not good enough. We need to stop this shit before it's too late. Get him out, put Rooney back up behind RvP or Wilson. Rooney looks like a poor mans Henderson at the moment. If Falcao were 19, I'd say we had to give him more time, but he is suppose to be on top of his career, and we've given him 30 games by now. We cut loose Forlan, and he looked like 10 times the striker Falcao is showing. If I had a time machine, I'd go back keeping Welbeck, not signing Falcao on loan.

7216~~~
It is golden goose, right? Or am I thinking of a normal goose that lays gold eggs? One of the two anyway.

7217~~~
May well score goals at another club but who cares, past his absolute best and will only get worse. For the sort of money Mendes wants I would want an Aguero type striker.

We need a dynamic, fast striker who will stretch opposition defences and give more room to our creative players.

The player does not even need to be a "big name", Berahino/Welbeck <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> or someone for example, Saha was never a massive name but we looked so much better with that type of striker in the team.

7218~~~
To play devil's advocate a little it isn't surprising if he or RVP (or Rooney) don't even get a shot on goal these days. It's taken till mid February for our top scorer to get to double figures and that was by a penalty. We're not playing to Falcao or RVP's strengths and the players behind them aren't in their best positions, although I would accept the front two's movement and partnership needs to improve. Van Gaal seems to appreciate what Falcao does though, I was surprised he started last night.

7219~~~
I think that we have got to the point now where the vast majority of United fans would not argue with the decision to bench Falcao and not sign him.

It is a shame because he is a very likable character. He used to absolutely explosive. It is sad to see him labouring like this. Send him to Juventus for his own sake!

7220~~~
100% finished.  He just doesn't seem comfortable on the ball, he's lost confidence, he's afraid, no pace, that injury destroyed him.

7221~~~
Even before his injury, he wasn't that great at Monaco (unlike James for instance). His terrible injury may have just emphasized a decline he was to enter as a player.

7222~~~
fair enough, I seldom watch matches outside the PL, but I guess I was excited by his reputation and his goals against Chelsea in the European Super Cup

7223~~~
When we signed him, there was a number of reports surfacing that we had already agreed to sign him permanently at the end of the loan deal. I certainly hope they are bogus reports. Otherwise, what was the point in taking him on loan?

I think he would do better if he was played in a system up top on his own, surrounded with creative players. A 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1, but even then, I think Rooney and even Van Persie would do better there. Falcao's touch looks so heavy, and his movement looks so laboured and uncomfortable. I really want him to succeed here, and every game he plays I'm dying for him to score, but he shouldn't really be in the team now, let alone next season.

At the start of the season, I thought it would be a good return for him to get 15 goals, but he'll be lucky if he even gets 8 at this rate. He works hard and he's been a good presence defensively from set pieces, so it's hard to dislike him, but he needs to be dropped.

7224~~~
Got to agree it was sad to watch him last night. Unless we get a huge turnaround in form from him there can't be any future for him here. A shame as his work ethic is spot on and he seems a genuinely decent bloke.

7225~~~
If a player has an impact in the smaller leagues or with smaller clubs in the bigger leagues, than he gets bought by a world class club and then he can prove he's a world class player, by playing against the best with world class expectations. To me Falcao always had to make that final step to prove himself world class, het got that chance last summer, and hasn't taken it yet. He probably won't because his first touch isn't and has never been world class, and that might explain why in his late twenties had only Porto, Atletico and Monaco to show for. I understand that watching YouTube video's of his goals and the simplest of all statistics give the impression he was already world class, but that's like judging a book by it's cover. Therefore comparisons to Sevchenko are not right. Sevchenko had proven himself in the CL, not the EL, and with one of the best clubs in the world at that time. Sevchenko stopped beeing a world class player, Falcao didn't start beeing one.

Actually, most of the players of Manchester United right now are not world class. how many of them would make it in the team if they were at Bayern for example? But yes, if Falcao succeeded here he should be considered world class.

7226~~~
Wilson's not ready to start games. We shouldn't be playing 2 strikers.

7227~~~
Kinda gutted, because i really wanted him to succeed here, but he is nowhere good enough right now, and i doubt he will ever be again. 

Maybe we could keep him if he was a bossman player or something, but he is lightyears away from being worth 30-40m

7228~~~
Another frustrating night, and blank, for Falcao

I honestly believe we have a world class striker on our hands here, and that the problems are further back. The defence is awful, which means the midfield is having to help more than they should and those two factors are making us negative. Its impossible to be all forward thinking with such a jittery defence. Falcao and RVP are basically feeding on scraps. If he was missing chance after chance then I'd be slating him too, but I see a striker desperate to succeed, who IS making a lot of good runs and just isnt being found. IF Falcao and RVP had more pace then that'd be great but it would encourage more long balls, and no one likes that either. So the only way we'll see the best of Falcao is to simply play better as a team. He'll get us goals, but only if we feed him

LVG has to see sense and revert to 442 with two wide men. everyone knows that system. It really is that simple

7229~~~
Open your eyes mate. Yes the team isn't performing but he will never regain what he once had. He just looks constantly gassed, he misses basically every chance he get's unless it's a tap in. There are much better strikers out there, we took a chance on his reputation and it's failed.

7230~~~
Its "failing" granted, its only failed once we give up on him. And I wont do that until he's gone (same applies for any United player). Just how I work

My bias comes from a) I've always been a striker myself (still trying at 48!) and b) I just dont like to see players fail

I'd desperately like to see how he does in a 442, if he cant score then, then I'll throw the towel in. Sadly LVG is too stubborn to revert, and its costing us. We're 3rd (somehow), and have a great chance to win the FA Cup, but it I just cant see it unless he wakes up and smells the coffee

7231~~~
I kind of see where you're coming from, but it also looks like Falcao's confidence is now shot. It just isn't happening for him. I remember his first few appearances, it seemed as though you could launch the ball at him from any angle/distance and he'd control it dead while holding off a horde of defenders. Looked so strong and composed. Now it's the complete opposite, the ball is bouncing off him and his strength appears to be vanishing.

7232~~~
I can see Falcao doing a Forlan or a Tevez, leaving United and scoring a hat full of goals for someone else. That being said, there is no justification for spending £40 odd million on Falcao after what we have seen this season. 

Sometimes a club just doesn't suit a player. Look at Torres. He was awful at Chelsea, he's gone back to Atleti and he's whacking them in against Madrid and Barca. Maybe Man Utd and Falcao are just a bad fit? We could spend the money on Falcao and pray he justifies it, but what if he doesn't? What a massive waste that would be when we've got Rooney, who I am sure would be doing a better job up front than Falcao is right now? 

I was desperate for Falcao to become a legend for us. It's not happened though and continuing to pick him is starting to be unfair on other players who have been better recently e.g. Mata, Fellaini, Herrera, and even Wilson. The side should be picked based on form not reputation. On form alone how can anyone say Falcao deserves to start or stay at Man Utd?

7233~~~
The moment i saw him get bullied by the burnley defenders did it for me. Would not buy.

7234~~~
Oh don't worry, that will happen regardless!

7235~~~
I hope he wakes up and realises what a hindrance Mendes has been to him. He looks like a man who knows every passing week that he is being found out as past it. Yet his agent constantly opens his mouth, undermining the manager which itself will strain the relationship between the player and coach. More significantly that move to Monaco flushed his career. The project there is completely sunk after a year, no one can or will want to pay the wages and transfer fee and he has suffered greatly from a lack of competitiveness. The guy should be at the peak of his powers. He's called the fecking King of the Europa League. Last CL match in 2010. He comes across a nice guy but I can't feel sorry for him because he's made idiotic career decisions.

7236~~~
Last night was up there with one of the worst performances I've ever seen from a front man. His first touch is awful, laughably so on occasions. If we end up spending 40m+ on him there is something horribly wrong at this club. Fortunately, I don't think we will.

7237~~~
He could still prove useful as an impact sub, inject a bit of energy against tired defenders, score some scrappy goal. 

People who had outrageous expectations of him have only themselves to blame for how devastated they feel that this 'isn't working out'. As with any loan at this level, he was always gonna be used sparingly, and eventually only bought if he was absolutely <i>on fire</i>. The odds never favored that outcome.

7238~~~
Last night was truly abysmal. I struggle to think of a senior player we've had up front that's been as poor as that in recent times, or even much further back. Yeah the odd youngster or random we've picked up along the way perhaps, but not someone who by all rights should be easily aiming for 15 to 20 goals a season.

His stats are almost funny - 11 duals lost on the floor (3 won), 8 duals lost in the air (1 won), no shots on target, no shots off target, no blocked shots, no crosses, fewest passes of any player - yet 1 assist somehow.

7239~~~
I did share your enthusiasm and hope that he just needed a few matches to get into the swing of things, but instead of getting better he's somehow getting worse. Yesterday he made MICHEAL KEANE look like Cannavaro and Nesta rolled into 1 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I do think he will perhaps play better when we spread the pitch and give him more space, but why should we be hoping that he suddenly can score? we should have the best of the best available. People like Danny Ings or Sakho would do a much better job and wouldn't cost us 40m and 300k a week!. It's sad but true <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

7240~~~
Are we being totally fair to him?

Yes he has had some shockers in general play but there were several times when he was providing a great option if he got the through ball played to him or a cross was hit earlier but the service is not up to scratch either I am afraid.

The west ham miss where he took it on his right instead of the left and put it wide was the tipping point for me. QPR was a big miss also and yes replays showed the defender got a touch but he had other chances that match.

If we started to get regular decent service and he kept missing chance after chance id be 100% behind him going.

7241~~~
Depay and maybay dyabala

7242~~~
We aren't totally fair to anyone so in that respect I'd say we are fair <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

No seriously I think he is a beter striker than many give him credit for, I personally like to see Falcao in the team a 100 times more than I like to see RVP in it, but obviously his performances are disappointing and at the moment considering his age, the injuries he has had, the money we would have to pay to get him on a permanent deal is too much. For that money we can buy a good striker that will be on his best for us for the next 5 years or something. Considering Dyabala and Lacazette will available in the summer, I'd rather we spend our money to get one of them. Also transfer price is not the only thing, wages is another one, a player that performs like that should not be one of the top earners, same can be said about RVP, which is why I will be desperately praying he'll leave us in the summer.

7243~~~
I have a feeling Brendan will take him off our hands and turn him into world class again next season.

7244~~~
A wild theory, but still the simple fact it is even hitting print speaks volumes of how obvious the problem is... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.blog.fantasy5live.com/2015/02/12/jorge-mendes-wont-allow-falcao-to-be-dropped-a-manchester-united-theory/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.blog.fantasy5live.com/20...cao-to-be-dropped-a-manchester-united-theory/</a>?

7245~~~
This. We need to invest that money in a young player who can give us 7-8 of his best years. Personally I'd replace both with 2 new strikers of similar age and potential who will really push each other. Over 500k a week on our current 2 is just a waste!

7246~~~
They'll be thinking the same about Mario who has zero injuries and is alot younger.

7247~~~
I can't see LVG doing such a thing tbh

7248~~~
Cant see LVG risking his job and reputation just to keep Mendes happy.

7249~~~
We might not be playing to his strengths.

7250~~~
The literary affectations in that article are hilarious.

7251~~~
He's had all the chances he should be afforded, chances based on past achievements. Sadly, he's not the player he was. It's time for Wilson.
Preferably up front on his own.

7252~~~
His job won't be at risk because Woodward will know the situation.

7253~~~
I think one out and out striker would be enough. Rooney should be played as a striker again or at the very least as a center forward and Wilson should get his chances upfront aswell. That would be 3 strikers combined with the attacking midfielders we have that would be more than enough for me. Also I think we should sign Depay as a left winger/ left forward.

Wilson+Rooney+Dyabala/Lacazette+Depay+Di Maria+Januzaj+Mata+Young(+Fellaini) = our attack next year

7254~~~
Nah, success on the pitch is more important to United's financial situation than keeping Mendes happy so even if Woodward was ok, I dont see the Glaziers tolerating bad results just to facilitate Falcao.

Bear in mind this is Falcao he is playing up front, not a hopeless cass like say Bebe. LVG might well believe that Falcao needs to keep playing through this bad patch to get to his best. Plus Falcao has sat out many games already so the theory doesn't hold water.

7255~~~
I noted a wild theory... my poorly worded point was that the problem is so obvious, without any reasonable explanation, that the conspiracy theories and other wacko ideas are now actually in print.

7256~~~
Yep, cant argue with that. Just sad that we cant get the best out of him

7257~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1841415214/parental-advisory.png" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1841415214/parental-advisory.png"/>

7258~~~
Ok.

7259~~~
What a fan,a true example.

7260~~~
Terrible again last night, surely after that performance LVG will have to drop him and basically just give up on him now, it looks unlikely he will even do anything to make the loan deal a success let alone come close to earning a permanent contract. There is no upside in continuing to play him although Mendes won’t be happy I think he will get over it quickly because he won’t want to miss out on the money Utd might be throwing around.

Falcao has tried his best but for him the season is a write off he needs to go away and think about his next move, if we could send him back to Monaco today I would do it because he is having an adverse effect on the team and living off his reputation. Wilson, Fellani, Herrera or Mata all deserve a chance ahead of him and I don’t think any of those would keep their place if they played as consistently badly as Falcao has done. Whether or not we drop Falcao could be the deciding factor in the race for the top 4, there just isn’t a defence for him anymore and he has to be left out of the team.

7261~~~
A Falcao + Cash swap for Lambert? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

7262~~~
I don't see Van Gaal accepting advice from the Glazers about who should play and who shouldn't, and certainly not take orders. Uli Hoeness tried that and he had to sack him to get his way.

But he's not going to give up on a player just because of one very poor game. Of course his performance yesterday has been noticed and will influence the decision on future starting line-ups. But he will get other chances, but if he keeps on working hard and does well in training, he will get games. Van Gaal might not like to admit he overestimated him, like lots of people did, and feel responsible towards the player, but also his stubborness has limits. It was last minute rent, Van Persie had injury issues, Wellbeck was not good enough and Wilson too young, not really that big a deal that it didn't work out. But the decision whether to keep him or let him go is not to be taken now.

7263~~~
No I got that you weren't advocating it as truth and I suppose I responded more so because Mendes' status makes such an event improbable rather than impossible.

7264~~~
There are limits. A guy like Falcao, who comes in with his contract will obviously provoke fans. The fact the guy is not giving any kind of value sure as hell won't help his case. He and his people put all this pressure on themselves and should get to deal with what we think about them. To support Falcao at this point is just stupid.

7265~~~
Agreed, I think at the time this was seen as a shrewd piece of business. We took Falcao from under the nose of PSG on a seemingly risk free loan. i don't think Welbeck or Wilson would have faired much better when the team has been quite poor overall in an attacking sense. Falcao is probably unfairly highlighted due to the fact he is on loan with an option to buy. RVP and Rooney have been largely disappointing this season too.

7266~~~
And Falcao is?

7267~~~
Yes, but I still think Falcao wasn't from the same level as Van Persie and Rooney when the last few years and still isn't. He was a bit of a hype, very well marketed but never really world class. 

Van Gaal often gets tempted by an out an out goalscorer, as do many managers: We create a lot of chances,  if we only had a real finisher.... then they get a real finisher and then it's if only we created more chances.... This is a classic problem that has a lot to do with the rule that there are only 11 players per team allowed on the pitch. Playing a player who's just their to score the goals often proves a high cost for the team in terms of loss of posession and all the creative work others have to do.  Modern world class strikers can do both.

7268~~~
I hoped he was going to be the Batistuta/Salas South American striker dream that didn't happen, but sadly it's not to be.

7269~~~
Never forget that it was Diego who made them scousers cry though, and we still have to go to Anfield...

7270~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

7271~~~
Absolutely great points - you've nailed it with that post.

And on the second bolded text - I totally agree, modern elite level strikers have more to their game than being a target man with no pace, and seeing so many on here excusing Falcao's atrocious contribution to our season is really strange ("he's a lovely guy", "seems like a top bloke" - based on <i>what</i>, exactly?). But as you said, it's hype, and hype goes a long, long way with most people.

In many ways Falcao (at his best) is a throwback. I could imagine if he'd turned up at the PL (in good form) in the early 2000's he'd probably have been a revelation, but football has moved on and evolved - even the modern number 9 like Costa for Chelsea contributes all over the pitch far more than Falcao (or RvP) does, he has hustle, he gets under opponents skin, he has a good touch, his hold up play is fantastic.

Falcao's presence is actively damaging how we're playing, and we're paying him elite player wages for that. This bothers me and I think the club should stop rewarding him with starts. We need to play RvP with Rooney behind him and bring on Falcao for RvP in the last 30 mins to make an impact.

The two of them should be competing for 1 position, not enjoying automatic starts together that are hindering the team. It's pathetic.

7272~~~
Mata has scored a goal (5) or made an assist (3) once every 184 minutes on the pitch.
Van Persie has scored a goal (10) or made an assist (2) once every 158 minutes on the pitch.
Rooney has scored a goal (8) or made an assist (4) once every 154 minutes on the pitch.
Herrera has scored a goal (2) or made an assist (3) once every 141 minutes on the pitch.
AdM has scored a goal (3) or made an assist (7) once every 130 minutes on the pitch.
Falcao has scored a goal (4) or made an assist (4) once every 117 minutes on the pitch.

Just saying.

7273~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
You're not 'just saying', your intentions are quite clear.

Perfect examples of how useless stats can be.

7274~~~
Every 135 actually but nice try.

Actually it seems that all those stats are wrong because you're leaving FA Cup out of your maths for some reason.

7275~~~
well...it was worth a punt. At least we didn't buy him. Could have turned out to be a master stroke...but sadly it didn't. Can't see him suddenly turning the corner now....too little time really.

7276~~~
Unless he scores hat-tricks against Chelsea or Liverpool....I really can't see him proving he is worth the permanent deal.
I like the guy, but that miss against West Ham.....oh dear....

7277~~~
I was stoked when he was announced, but it's just not worked. 

I do hope it was structured as a loan with the option to buy rather than any obligation to buy to allow monaco to reduce their FFP responsibilities.

7278~~~
Heard a stat on the Football Ramble: of all the players to have 20 or more shots in the league, only Costa has a higher shooting accuracy percentage than Falcao, which sounds mental if true. Of course, it means absolutely nothing really, if anything it says to me that A) he's probably not had a huge amount of shots, and B) most of his shots are straight at the keeper-maybe he doesn't have the confidence to 'hit the corners' when he does shoot, and is just getting weak efforts on target? I don't know.

7279~~~
The elephant in the room here is the fact that Van Gaal plays him all the time. Perhaps he rates him? Gave him a big high five yesterday when he brought him off. We might still sign him...

7280~~~
It'd be a really, <i>really</i> bad move from the club if we did.

His presence could soon (if not already) have a detrimental effect in the dressing room - players are highly competitive and not the emotionless robots that many fans assume them to be, and it won't have gone unnoticed that he's dramatically overpaid, over-played and utterly shit.

You can't have the absolute worst performers getting the highest wages and the most opportunities for long before disharmony sets in - that goes for any workplace.

7281~~~
I don't think he's been nearly as bad as people try to claim, at worse he's anonymous but then so is RVP and his performances go by largely unnoticed most of the time. If he's lucky he's getting maybe one chance a game on average at the moment, same with RVP. If people are expecting him to bang in the goals its just not going to happen. It's taken till mid February for our top scorer to get to double figures, our strikers just aren't going to score goals with the way we're playing at the moment. At least he got another assist last night.

7282~~~
I'd like to keep him, he has no confidence and is playing in a very un-cohesive team but I'm still quite sure the quality is there.

7283~~~
Not hiding from the fact he was poor, the worst I have seen him play. However, in defence of him, he was shot by his teammates. So many players got the ball, looked up, saw Falcao with 3 players around him then gave him a bouncing ball to control. He was not helped one bit.

If we make top 4, I would do everything to keep him (yes it's a shot load of money but welcome to 2015, well be spending a lot more than that in a few years). I truly believe the top striker that he is, is still there but others areas need to be fixed in order to get the best out of him. And I think his best, is better than what RVP can offer over the next 2-3 seasons.

7284~~~
No pretending he hasn't been poor. But the thing about Falcao is, he's a poacher in the purest sense. Play him in a team that players any semblence of normal attacking football with a reasonable amount of creativity and he'll convert the chances. We've not exactly done him a favour by being so crap in terms of build up and creation.

7285~~~
If we played 20 metres higher up the pitch, he would be a completely different player. And a completely different team to be honest.

7286~~~
So you are comparing the stats of a centre forward with everyone else barring another centre forward, and Rooney has not played there is 2 months. Amazing. Why don't you throw in similar stats for DDG to let us all know how much better Falcao has been.

7287~~~
I wonder if the loan included an agreement to sign him the next season no matter what, considering similar moves have been made by other clubs recently. While I don't think there's any ffp reason for that, it might help to keep the numbers in check or avoid giving the impression the spending was getting out of hand. Just speculation, but it's a possibility I thought about when the loan was announced.

7288~~~
To be fair I think that was always what the impression was at the start, but hopefully we've not agreed anything iron clad. I would hope Woodward had a get out clause, but then everybody thought Falcao would be a success <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

7289~~~
Is there anyone, who thinks that it's just a phase ? That he still can retrieve a little bit of form.

7290~~~
I do, but playing him into form in current setup won't work.

7291~~~
I really want him to succeed but I don't know what is wrong with him at the moment, the chances that he misses, are "disgraceful".

7292~~~
what setup would work?

7293~~~
It's up to manager to find one that brings the best out of the team, but definietely not both RvP - Falcao at the same time. I would try Falcao and Rooney up top, Herrera behind. Midfield of Blind, Fellaini, Di Maria. RvP doesn't have the energy to play 90', he should interchange with Radamel.

7294~~~
...a setup that involves Falcao hopping in a time machine and going back 3 years... but to seriously answer your question Falcao would look much better in a 4-2-3-1 with Rooney right behind him. The other positive here is Rooney would look much better as a CF/CAM than a CM/CDM.

7295~~~
I want to give up on him, but I don't think we should really do that until the team is actually playing well. Ideally, he should be a player that would carry a team when they're playing poorly. Unfortunately, he hasn't shown that for us. Then again, no one apart from De Gea has really shown that.

If he flops when we play well, then fine.

7296~~~
agree with this but RVP would look better than falcao in that set up. i just think he's shot. at least in the prem. should be looking elsewhere for a striker or two.

7297~~~
I think if he scores in two or three games in a row he may discover some form. He has had moments where he has looked very good and others where he has been below average. His finishing has been erratic by his high standards. I don't know why people are writing him off already. Let's just wait to see how he does for the rest of the season first its a terrible injury he is recovering from

7298~~~
When exactly has he looked good? 

He's been absolutely terrible in every game I've seen

7299~~~
With all due respect, I'm sure that you <i>do</i> know why people are writing him off as a loan signing we're spending £20m for 1 season - he's been utterly woeful and the whole world knows it.

Secondly, while I hope that he recovers well from his injury, it isn't our concern, or at least it shouldn't be - it's Monaco's, <i><b>he's a Monaco player!</b></i>

If it's come to the point where we're paying £20m a season to loan players who aren't fit and then nursing them back to form while paying their massive wages then we really, really need to look at our scouting and recruitment approach, because that's just a joke.

I would hope that the club's executives are absolutely <i>seething</i> about this deal behind closed doors because it's an embarrassment for the club to be scammed so publicly by Mendes. And to add further insult, the man is gobbing off in the press desperately trying to increase pressure on us to play this guy every game.

Awful deal, I'm struggling to think of a worse loan deal for United - actually, I'm struggling to think of a worse loan deal for any big club.

7300~~~
Already ??? We're in February and there haven't any promising signs. He was already declining before his injury.

7301~~~
Ultimately I think we need to give him an 8 year deal and see how he does over that long a period. That's the true test of a player.

7302~~~
Floppy flop.

7303~~~
Have read a few reports that he is actually a United player and only the formalities need to be completed in the summer. <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

7304~~~
Yeah, a lot of journos said that around the time. I hope to feck that it's not true.

7305~~~
God no, I hope not. If it is the case, Mendes has got us wrapped around his finger????

7306~~~
Would you be happy to sign him if it ensured de Gea signed an extension? I would.

7307~~~
I still have faith it's a matter of not being comfortable with the way he is being played on the field. It's almost impossible that suddenly Di María, Rooney, Falcao, Herrera and others have become shit and all at the same time and in the same team. It's got to be something else even if Falcao is not at his best.

7308~~~
Doubtful. Why would Mendes be mouthing off in the press trying to push for a deal?

7309~~~
Probably not as I think whether De Gea signs a deal or not, he's off in the near future. So probably the main benefit of signing Falcao would be that you get maybe another season from him and a higher fee, which doesn't really matter to me. But if you sign a £46m striker then he's going to play and I think we're seeing that this guy is no longer good enough, even if you forget his price.

7310~~~
Think it's €40 million so roughly £30 million.

7311~~~
Dunno really. I'm just pointing out that plenty of journos said it was a done deal at the time. Perhaps that's just something that was put around.

7312~~~
I dunno what to make of it really to be honest. I think we should go into next season without one of van Persie or Falcao in our squad, no idea who we should rid ourselves of though. But if Mendes does have us by the balls over de Gea, I'd be swayed towards his client...

7313~~~
I like the sound of that. Would be worth a try.

7314~~~
Ok obviously I do know why people have decided he's a flop but my point is we have him here till May. The loan fee and wages need to be paid until then regardless I just think we need to wait until May and then assess whether we keep him or not (which seems unlikely).

"Utterly woeful" is harsh as there have been times when he has looked very good albeit in a very sporadic basis.

So to summerize my thoughts, no we shouldn't sign him barring a miraculous second half of the season BUT I'll continue to support him whilst he is still at the club

7315~~~
The same can be said of RvP - they're both looking old and slow as shit stuck in a freezer.

7316~~~
It's sad for Falcao but everything is against him, the league he is playing in, the condition of his knees and worst of all the setup of the team. If we are not going to play the team to his strengths then I see no point in signing him for the crazy fees he would demand. At this stage I wouldn't buy him for 5 million let alone 40!

7317~~~
Even if he gets it together I don't think it's the most sensible use of the transfer fee and £200K+ in wages.
It would show short-term thinking.

7318~~~
I would give my left kidney for De Gea new contract, let alone a few Glazer's money.

7319~~~
If that's De Gea's condition for signing on then he can feck off to Spain.

7320~~~
Hes not a top half of the table level striker anymore.

7321~~~
He's still got it, he just hasn't settled in completely and its unfortunate.

7322~~~
I highly doubt anyone would take him on a free transfer with his current wages the way he has performed.

7323~~~
No.......despite what people say de Gea is replaceable but spending 40 million on a bag a shite like falcao is unforgivable and will yet again make us a laughing stock

7324~~~
When I watch him play, physically I don't see anything wrong with him.  He doesn't look like he's laboring in his movements.   Generally speaking it does take about a year to fully recover from an ACL injury so maybe he could start to take off relatively soon.  
I think Falcao's struggles is due to him playing in an unfamiliar setup with two strikers and putting too much pressure on himself.  Strikers need confidence to play with a swagger and he doesn't have it.  Couple that with him adapting to a new league and the biggest club he's ever played for in his career, the pressure adds up.  To top it off, he knows it's a loan deal and has to score consistently in order to justify the fee and stay.

7325~~~
If it was true Mendes wouldn't be defending Falcao performances every weeks, unless he is trying to convince us fans that he is better than he is.

7326~~~
And when they are on a good run when they are full of confidence and don't seem able to miss and even their poor first touch is decent, we take that as their normal level?

7327~~~
Its funny cause if you'd never watched united before, who'd currently justify being paid anything given their performances. I'm not saying we should sign him or not but lets be honest, he's performances are in context of the team, he's just equally as poor. Does Di Maria justify his 60m price tag currently? 

The last time I played football, it was a team sport. If he was in the 2008 team today, would we be having this conversation....I really don't think so.

7328~~~
It's not their or in this case Radamel's normal level.  It's like someone needs to show him his YouTube goal compilation for Atletico and scream at him, "This is what you're capable of!"

7329~~~
I know he's struggled but at least he puts a shift in. I'd rather persevere with him than be continually made to suffer RVP strolling around looking disinterested. He's had one brilliant season for us then had about 5 decent games ever since.

At the moment neither striker is worth their place but I find it easier to be sympathetic with Falcao...

7330~~~
He's been absolute shite for us. Every single time the ball gets played to his feet with his back facing the goal he concedes possession and ends up on his arse. I've seen him get up off the floor to run his fingers through his hair then I have of him actually playing football. Shame how the knee injury has taken its toll but it will be criminal to splash out £30 million plus to make him a permanent signing based off his current performances.

7331~~~
Where does the illusion come from that RVP is disinterested, just look at last season, how desperate he was for United to come back, it really bothered him and he showed that he care. Just because he doesnt run around the whole match doesnt mean that he doesnt care anymore. Dont think he did that at Arsenal either, correct me if wrong. When in play, he's as active as always, making runs, come and getting the ball, trying to link up. Besides that, in terms of quality he's been miles ahead of Falcao, scored some quality goals, has shown to being able to keep the ball well. Our 2nd goal vs burnley for example, some brilliant hold up play from him, but that goes unnoticed.

7332~~~
I think he has done that more this season than previous seasons, especially at the start of the season when he started to play. RVP doesn't need pace, he has got the deft little touch and is astute enough to make himself efficient when on the ball. Falcao has done nothing of the sorts, his touch has been absolutely terrible and he hasn't made up for that fact when gifted easy finishes. Some of the chances he has missed is beyond ridiculous.

7333~~~
It's his pace that worries me the most. He was never lightening quick, but now he looks like he can barely even sprint.

7334~~~
Would that be due to the injury?  Or is he just older than Wiki says?

7335~~~
I'd imagine it's the injury. I think <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> (sorry if it wasn't you) said that he got the injury the same time as Walcott got his, yet Falcao was trying to be rushed back for the World Cup and Walcott is only coming back from his injury now. Quite a big difference, obviously no two injuries are the same but still.

7336~~~
Some 'Denis Law' character, whoever he is.

7337~~~
Im not saying that he wil start banging them in but a change to a 4 2 3 1 formation would put falcao in a more familiar role . 
If he was playing for chelsea he would have double figures by now . 
What really as surprised me about van gaal is that he has had no hesitation in dropping defenders and midfielders that have had bad games but rvp and falcao have become somewhat "undroppable" ,
With the chances being missed upfront and lack of movement why are we not putting one of uniteds ALL TIME GOALSCORERS back upfront and put herrera in rooneys position ! At least give it a try for fecks sake. 

One thinks that falcaos "let's not upset mendes" syndrome plus his massive wages are contributing to him being picked almost every game . The dutch love in withr rvp is making him bomb proof as well . 
i think we need a big pace injection in the summer transfer window . It could be another big over haul of players witha right back , centre half , box to box cm and maybe striker and wide man needed as well as the david de gea situation rumbling on .

Also as anyone seen ryan giggs speak to LVG during a game ????

7338~~~
As much of a legend the King is, he's merely toeing the party line in the case of Falcao, who is a busted flush.

7339~~~
He's quite obviously not still got it.

7340~~~
For those who believe the Mendes theory - they clearly dont know LVG. 
LVG doesnt give a damn about agents and their wishes. He runs the team - its his way or the high way.
In fact, he has p'd off many CEO's of clubs, as he wanted to run the team his way. He has been sacked as result.

Some managers may bow to pressure from agents or above...but not LVG.

7341~~~
It could well be more complicated than that, though.

This is Van Gaal's last big job, and he knows it. If he walked on this job where's he gonna go?

He could be under immense pressure from Woodward <i>and</i> Mendes over this (for different reasons) and have decided to ride it out for a season.

I personally don't believe that Falcao was a Van Gaal signing because he always plays with one number 9 - not two. And RvP is his man.

If you recall the World Cup, you'll remember that it was <i>always</i> RvP OR Huntelaar - never together.

No intelligent manager would be playing Falcao and RvP together, they're literally <i>useless</i> together. There must be more to it in my opinion.

7342~~~
My main worry about Falcao is that we will let him leave end of the season, and then City will buy him for the sake of it and turn him into the superstar we know he can become. Tevez-like maybe but possibly on a worse scale.

7343~~~
Tevez's best years were ahead of him. Once he got some ruthlessness in front of goal he was always going to do a great job because he already had the other qualities to be a top striker (movement, strength, change of pace, close control, work rate, versatility). Falcao looks feeble and lacking in so many of those departments.

7344~~~
City wouldn't go near him.

You won't see any elite club in for him - they weren't before this and they sure as hell won't be now.

7345~~~
On what evidence do you base this post on ??
On what we've seen from him this season he will be lucky to get a move to any team in european Competition next season .

7346~~~
No chance city or any other premier league side will touch him after this season, he isn't good enough to start for any top English side and too expensive to be a backup. Bigger worry is we actually sign him and get stuck with a washed up forward for another few seasons who costs a fortune in wages and a big transfer fee.

7347~~~
Martin Samuel says that we made the decision not to sign him weeks ago. Hardly surprising but would explain Mendes whoring him out to the rest of Europe recently.

7348~~~
<b>Van Gaal on Falcao:</b>

“There are more aspects for a striker than goals. For example in the game with Burnley [last Tuesday] you have seen the header back for [Chris] Smalling to score was from Falcao.

“To be approachable for your fellow players is also an aspect. I shall not judge only on the goals. It is a bigger view than that.”

Seems that Van Gaal's contradicting himself, because he didn't seem to have this in mind when getting rid of Welbeck - a player who seemed to have made us tick in the final third. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2015/02/14/louis-van-gaal-falcao-may-stay-at-manchester-united-but-i-shall-not-judge-only-on-the-goals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/...ited-but-i-shall-not-judge-only-on-the-goals/</a>

7349~~~
Shame Welbeck didn't enjoy such philosophical judgement...

He didn't have Mendes as an agent though, did he.

7350~~~
I think we are planning to keep him based on this <a class="externalLink" href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31477919" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31477919</a>

7351~~~
He's gone then. Samuel seldom reports and isn't putting his name to that unless it's come from the top.

7352~~~
I hope so.

If so we need to quit the experiment and get the best possible balance out of the players we have available. Not shoehorning Falcao into every line-up and playing another midfielder (Mata, Herrera or Fellaini) would improve the side immediately.

7353~~~
They've been useless together mainly because Falcao has been useless, and partly because RvP has had his poor performances. Your comparison with Huntelaar doesn't make much sense. Falcao is overestimated, but still has a lot more possibilities than Huntelaar, who is on a lower level and who is basically just waiting for the perfect cross and sitters for him to finish. A player like Falcao has enough skills to play in a partnership like Cole and Yorke. When Van Gaal started the Netherlands job, he of course chose one striker, because he started out with 4-3-3, and he chose Huntelaar. That was also necessary to manage the external problems surrounding Huntelaar. Huntelaar failed, because he's not very good. When changed to 3-5-2 because the lack of balance in midfield, he picked van Persie and Robben, which was the only sensible choice. 

In my opinion he wanted Falcao because RvP's fysical condition made it unlikely he would play 38 games, he wanted Rooney to run the show in midfield and therefore not move him up front a lot of games, because then he would disrupt the development in team play. But he's also tempted by a goalscorer, and a strikers partnership, and overestimated Falcao as did most.

7354~~~
Good.

7355~~~
That doesn't make much sense tbh, as we are still playing him. If we genuinely have made that decision weeks ago, then why are we still shoehorning 3 strikers into our formation?

7356~~~
I agree. He wouldn't be playing if Van Gaal thought he was out, and even less with his horrible performances.

7357~~~
Maybe Welbeck was not as 'approachable for his fellow players" - he always seemed a bit aloof to me

7358~~~
Where is that helicopter we used to get Mata to Carrington? it needs to come and take Falcao back to Monaco

7359~~~
Cant excel vs third and fourth division sides, one of the most average strikers at the club recently, get rid please, he's holding us back.

7360~~~
He's a liability. What does he do exactly other than make you rage? He is like some sort of ultimate troll.

7361~~~
In that case get rid of most of those players because nobody has excelled against Preston.

7362~~~
He has been awful the last couple of games. Really properly shit.

7363~~~
some times it's amazing how little star players shine when playing teams miles below them.

Yet take a semi pro onto park footy and they'd look like Pele

7364~~~
Want him to do well but yet again he's nonexistent, he's just not the player he was.

7365~~~
Offers nothing, take him off and bring on januzaj, Wilson or mata, looks like his legs are weighted down every time he tries to move.

7366~~~
Think we should, but he also couldnt vs Yeovil and Cambridge, wtf. Is this a United striker?

7367~~~
He's probably the worst centre forward I've seen play for us in the last 20 years. He does nothing well.

7368~~~
Agree. He's the latest dog to kick. If everyone was playing well and it was a Forlan situation, that's different but the quality of the final ball is shocking. Compare this with Cesc and how he feeds Costa. We are creating zero chances and it doesn't matter whether we had Messi and CR7 up front.

7369~~~
He's a donkey.

7370~~~
Yeah it's not the best team to be playing in as a centre forward but at the same time, Rooney has made more dangerous runs in this match than Falcao has made in the past month...

7371~~~
We basically signed a poor man's Berbatov

7372~~~
Scapegoat. Even though the team has been crap all the way through, he's being singled out despite there being four or five players worse than him tonight.

7373~~~
He's so terrible can't he just feck off back to france now can't stand him anymore

7374~~~
Huh? Berbatov had a silky touch. Falcao's first touch is usually his last.

Not that he has been any worse than the rest today.

7375~~~
Just piss off!!!!!

7376~~~
I said a poor man's Berbatov

7377~~~
Might as well have said a poor man's Messi then.

7378~~~
More like beggar's man Berbatov out of form. He won't get his form back.

7379~~~
Falcao wouldn't be able to get onto the end of those passes, he is genuinely useless there is no defence for him.

7380~~~
No wonder he is playing shite, the fella can't see.

7381~~~
What ever happened to this bloke? He's the new Gary Birtles.

7382~~~
Radabish falcao trying to be sarcastic

7383~~~
Hopefully we don't sign him permanently. His knee injury completely ruined him.

7384~~~
He's absolutely awful. No pace, can't control a ball and too static. 

Nowhere near the player he was and no chance anyone in the world will pay big money for him
After this season.

7385~~~
I feel really sorry for him. He seems like a decent lad and he works hard. He's just seriously struggling with form and confidence. Such a shame

7386~~~
He won't start a game again for United. The final straw.

7387~~~
I've always liked him but I've given up on him here. He's not good enough. I know we aren't playing well as a team but he hasn't shown enough

7388~~~
Lost it hasn't he, I wouldn't sign him on a free at this point he's not worth his wages.

If it was SAF he wouldn't play for us again.

7389~~~
I really wanted it to work out for him here and afforded him plenty of time. But my God, he looks a shadow of the player he once was.  He offers absolutely nothing. There's still probably a good player there somewhere, but we won't see it with these tactics.

7390~~~
Haha that's what I thought, he's been terrible because he's lost his contacts 

all is clear now

7391~~~
Not for him

7392~~~
I don't know if he's past his best, but he has no future with us.

7393~~~

7394~~~
I'm livid with that reaction. What an absolute bell end

7395~~~
I hope he never plays for United again.

7396~~~
He was utter shit but the two striker formation is making him look even worse. Either play one striker and don't play him.

7397~~~
Biggest let down since Veron..  Dreadful player.

7398~~~
Didnt see it, is that spoiler accurate?

7399~~~
The fact that I can type with absolute certainty that I think Fellaini is a better striker than him is just bizarre.

7400~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/5RS5n8T.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/5RS5n8T.jpg"/>

7401~~~
It's becoming more and more evident that he and RvP are two of biggest problems right now. Even Fellaini is doing a better bloody job up front.

7402~~~
I hope you're right, I think we would improve as a team if he doesn't play, fellaini has looked miles better playing up front instead of him.

7403~~~
Exactly the same.

7404~~~
His performances are not getting any better. No light at the end of the tunnel. He just looks so out of his depth. If he started this bad but had managed to score a few goals post Xmas and his play had improved then maybe he would be worth the risk. But on the evidence we can't sign him.

7405~~~
Team instantly look 10+ better once he goes off, even Fellaini looks more dangerous as a striker.

7406~~~
Offers nothing, injuries have taken away what a great player he was once. Would be delighted if we didn't play him again this season. Shame, really wanted him to hit the ground running and be a big success here. Not going to happen though.

7407~~~
Mendes will be lucky to fit him into any half decent team across Europe.

Then again I'm fooling myself, with his connections the worst he'll do in the Summer are probably Juventus or Valencia.

7408~~~
I can see him at Zenit St Petersburg. Monaco's owner is Russian, they've got loads of money to buy mercenaries (although have they been affected by the economic problems in Russia?), lower standard of league and a chance to reunite with Villas-Boas and Hulk.

7409~~~
The fat lady has well and truly sung. Falcao can't turn this around unless LvG changes the system to a 4-3-3 with him spearheading.

7410~~~
I thought he might go to Asia or even more likely USA for a minute but then I think he'll want to stay in Europe for a few more years before heading somewhere else for his last big pay check. He will look back at that Monaco move with great regret, not only Atletico managed to improve considerably after he left and ended up winning trophies while he lingered around 2nd/3rd place in France playing in front of 10,000 people, he also got an injury that cost him his last World Cup place and it doesn't look like he's ever going to perform for a big club again. What looked like a shrewd deal in the Summer looks like very bad business right now, the likes of Real Madrid, Chelsea and City really dodged a bullet here.

7411~~~
fecking Fellaini is a better striker than him.

7412~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he's about the same age

7413~~~
He's not staying.

7414~~~
He'd slow us down and hold us back in 433 too. Just not good enough for this level anymore, he would actually look out of place at West Brom the way he's been playing recently.

7415~~~
Even he must know now that there is zero chance he will get a permanent deal, best for everyone involved to bench him and move on, his reputation would probably benefit by not playing.

7416~~~
He wouldn't get in their team.

7417~~~
I know you're not supposed to post gifs in football related forums, but I came across this. 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://www.ultraimg.com/images/c9u1X.gif" src="http://www.ultraimg.com/images/c9u1X.gif"/> 

Does he have shit eye sight? Could explain a lot....Or was he just being petulant?

7418~~~
laters falcao

7419~~~
I'm actually not sure what would be worse, that he was being a knob, or that he actually couldn't see the board <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7420~~~
Fellaini is a better number 9 than him. Just send him on holiday and put Wilson on the bench, he's done here.

7421~~~
Pains me to say it but he needs to stop being played. 

It was worth trying, I was excited when he arrived, but it ain't worked and its not going to change between now and May.

7422~~~
Even his effort and good attitude has gone now

7423~~~
He looks finished I'd rather start with Fellaini up top than Falcao.

7424~~~
I can't believe I actually dread seeing this guy on the team sheet now. 

Such a shame, even sharper decline than Torres

7425~~~
Substitute appearances from now on, if we are injury free there is simply no way we can start him anymore.

7426~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I know we should obviouly keep performance threads open, but it's funny to know that after every game you get either regulars or new entrants coming in with the same "he's done" posts in the this thread; almost pointless to check it because the posts are identical. 

It really is a shame because of what we could have potentially had after seeing what he has done during his career, but unfortunately he doesn't seem to have won over van Gaal to see, and rightly so with what he has brought to this club. Great work ethic, loves the club, but the injury seems to have killed that natural killer instinct he had.

7427~~~
Yep, don't blame the club for trying- for £6M plus wages it was worth a shot because of how good he was but I really hope we haven't already signed him.

7428~~~
Felt sorry for him when he came off, he really has declined <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

United were so much better when he came off.

7429~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/9zpyxpD.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/9zpyxpD.jpg"/>

7430~~~
Far worse decline than Torres, shevcheko too

It's mendieta level of decline. He looks done

7431~~~
It's a shame that he isn't the player he was, and that it just hasn't happened for him. We would be a better team with a form Falcao in it. Alas.

7432~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I think he might have problems with his eye sight because I have seen him wearing glasses when the team have been on nights out. That doesn't excuse his performance tonight though, truly awful.

7433~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

His 'eye problems' might explain a few things tbh.

7434~~~
I sure hope that wasn't a sarcastic squint from him, because he can't fecking ran or control a ball.

7435~~~
Imagine sitting on the United bench as Marouane Fellaini outperforms you as a striker.

#JustFalcaoThings

7436~~~
Stick him in our team with Hazard, Cesc, etc and I think he'd be scoring loads.

If we win the league I can see Drogba retiring. Falcao wouldn't be a bad replacement as long as the asking price isn't ridiculous.

7437~~~
Well, hopefully you sign him then!

7438~~~
Someone buy him a one way ticket back to Monaco please. Just holding us and  Wilson back.

7439~~~
You obviously haven't seen some of his misses this season then.

I don't think he's struck one clean shot yet.

7440~~~
How's that going to help him control a ball?

7441~~~
Thing is, if we were to sign him and he gets back to being the Falcao of old, how bad would it make you guys look?

7442~~~
He'd have done a lot better in the system we used at the end, but he was shite up till that point. Rooney was worse though.

7443~~~
I don't believe Falcao is salvageable. Honestly bro.

7444~~~
Mate it seems the ball literally has to be put across the goal line for him to score. He isn't showing any other qualities and looks so devoid of self belief. The ball doesn't stick, he can't get in behind, he can't win aerial duels, his touch is erratic and he looks on the verge of collapsing so often. Early on in the season he showed some energy without doing much productivity wise but as the season has gone on it's like having Samaras.

7445~~~
How? 

His general play is piss poor and he lacks any pace. People need to stop talking about systems.

7446~~~
Its not our fault that the lad can barely walk, never mind run. Let alone control a football.

You could stick him in a team with Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar and Hazard, and all it would do is magnify just how poor he is.

7447~~~
It's a gamble I'd fancy, put it that way.

...what?

7448~~~
Fair enough, but I don't think he's "Torres'd" yet. I think he's just very low on confidence and can't really get himselft into form becasue he's in and out of the side and playing with so many different combinations of teammates.

Think what he needs is a long run in a settled side to get the best out him again.

7449~~~
I bet that squinty look he gave the numbers board is the same one some of our other players give the team sheet when they see his name on it and theirs on the bench.

7450~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Damn. Didn't think he was <i>that </i>poor.

7451~~~
goodbye

7452~~~
To be fair, a lot of people tend to exaggerate his performances as if a conference player would put in the effort he does.

He has been bad compared to what he is being quoted as in terms of transfer fee and his wages, but the guy has managed to get 8 goals and assists this season which is in our top 5, even by looking shit. He works hard and looks like a striker bereft of confidence sadly.

7453~~~
AC Milan job for the lad.

7454~~~
Pretty sure that he's done at United.

7455~~~
I really like Falcao, but I can't keep defending him if he's putting in performances like that.

7456~~~
How many of our matches have you seen? The only trick he's shown is that he's somehow still getting matches ahead of our other options after the performances he's put in lately. He's been completely dire for a number of matches now, and he's looking just as hapless as Torres was for you lot.

He might find <i>some</i> sort of form again eventually, but I can't see it being for us, and I certainly can't see him getting anywhere near the level that is expected of a main striking option at a top club.

Edit: Might be worth pointing out that I am absolutely gutted that it isn't working out. I didn't watch that much of Falcao in his prime, but what I saw of him was absolutely top, top class. I remember that UEFA Cup final against Bilbao. He just destroyed them and scored two goals in the process. Was immensely excited when we got him.

7457~~~
Ive said it a thousand times, Don't care who plays up front, we have provided nothing for the forwards in general. Hitting the target man is not the utd way. He's a good player and has quality but there is no patience in football anymore. If people had their way, Felliani, Tony or Young wouldn't even be on the pitch.....

7458~~~
Really beginning to think that the guy out there playing is not actually Falcao.

7459~~~
He's got a first touch to rival Douglas Bader's.

7460~~~
At this stage I think I'd prefer to see Fellaini start up top ahead of him. I don't get any pleasure out of saying that <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

7461~~~
Wasn't the board blurry?

7462~~~
I don't think he was that bad, its not like he missed a series of chances. He was just mostly anonymous because the ball barely got to him, those behind him played with no urgency till we went 1-0 down.

7463~~~
I think we do need a run without both RVP and Falcao. The whole build up seems much better and not as static without them. On MUTV I'm sure they said that LVG is looking at adding a striker in Summer and rightfully so, we are in dire need of some movement and speed up there.

7464~~~
There's always a scapegoat on forums. Wasn't it Young and Felliani? Issues around defence, what's our defence record now? I'm old enough to remember when we allowed players a season at least......not anymore it seems. 
I heard the same negativity about Mata. It's turning into an absolute joke!!!!!

7465~~~
Of course, against Burnley he was poor but wasn't bad tonight, held up and fought for quite a few balls but service was not good in first half. Anyway the fanbois have decided he's the scapegoat, someone even blamed him for conceding tonight. Let's all join the bandwagon and want him out - sorry but no sheep or hysterical schoolgirl here, still convinced he will come good

7466~~~
Not great but feel sorry for him.

We finally started to put crosses in to the box which he would love, but this was once he was off the pitch.

His biggest mistake was trying to get fit for the world cup, about 3-4 months after his injury. He should be returning from football now and I think he would be better off for it now.

7467~~~
Just don't mention Bader's dog.

7468~~~
That should have been his last chance.

Wilson, step up, young man.

7469~~~
I agree with all of this.

7470~~~
Shhh, stop trying to defend him now, once a player plays bad he will never recover from it. Remember RvP is done forever after the start of this season too!

7471~~~
Just like you guys did with Veron then?

7472~~~
I'm not pro Falcao, it's more what he represents. We paid 60m for DiMaria, are we getting value for money? People are too quick to press the button.

7473~~~
I really wanted to see him succeed here. I mean he's Radamel fecking Falcao. Unfortunately, he's been a flop for us. A shadow of the player we all want him to be. 

If he starts against Swansea, then it's a fecking joke.

7474~~~
In the past 3-4 matches I can only think of one maybe two decent chances hes had. The fact it isnt surprising if he and RVP don't even manage a shot at the moment is telling. If the team played with the same urgency they did when we went 1-0 down things would pick up for the strikers.

7475~~~
I got the impression that Falcao's squinting at the board was meant to be making a point, after all the announcer had clearly said his name, and I wasn't impressed. There has been nothing in any of Falcao's performances lately to show surprise at being taken off. Tonight he was terrible, sadly. 

Others have been having an impact lately yet getting less game time e.g. what's Mata done wrong lately, score against Cambridge? Falcao has been coasting through games (as has Van Persie) and its about time players in better form got a chance to play. 

Its clear that things aren't gonna work out for Falcao at United. He'll leave in the summer and probably score 30/40 goals for someone else and blame it all on the evil Van Gaal. Truth be told though, Falcao's had a run of games since Christmas time despite other players deserving it more and he's shown nothing. Maybe, like Forlan, Veron and others, he's a damn good player but just not made for Man Utd.

7476~~~
They don't offer any movement which is a big problem, and Falcao's hold up play is a bit shit as well. He's pretty weak physically and is slow so he ends up being a bit useless. In the first half Rooney made more runs and had more through passes played to him then we've seen RvP and Falcao make in all of 2015 pretty much. The build up play is of course a problem, but RvP and Falcao have been an even bigger one.

7477~~~
Glad Van Gaal lost patience with him today though. Another useless performance. The thing is with him is that there hasn't been one game this season where he's looked class, or like he's some really talented player. Not even a glimpse of it. He had a few decent performances but everything is lacking from him.

7478~~~
We cannot keep excusing our forwards like that forever, they have to go out there and create space for themselves, make runs, pick up the ball or at least show basic set of skills like control a ball when it's passed their way etc. He hasn't shown that he's capable of doing any of these, besides I don't buy the argument that strikers need obscene amount of passes directed in their way to be able to do anything.

7479~~~
That move when Fellaini received a pass from Di Maria and held the defender up, turned and shot is the bread and butter for a striker. Falcao can't even do the basics right.

7480~~~
That's what everyone (including myself) thought 3 months ago.

Think he's not going to make it here, unfortunately.

7481~~~
Deserves to be dropped now.

7482~~~
All the players get criticised and I have no particular favourite but Di Maria and Falcao am sure will come good and excited that they play for United, di Maria has probably shown more than Falcao so far but these things take time.
People want instant gratification and six months seems like an eternity for some.
After we won the title in 2003 and the 99 team gradually broke up we went 4 years before winning the next title, during a rebuilding "process', even if Chelsea win it this year it will be 5 years since they won it. Gradually it will all come together and hopefully Falcao will be part of it

7483~~~
I do feel sorry for him as there isn't a lack of effort but he's clearly not the Falcao of 2 years ago, yet.

7484~~~
Our service is wack, but he isnt even likely to create a chance for. So slow and weak, terrible technique and hold up play. Other than that, I domt think his positioning is that good, for example this season Harry Kane, he positions himself in goalscorinf positions constantly, Falcao is all over the pitch. The fact that he cant create a chance for himself is also pretty terrible, your whole game cant just rely on service.

7485~~~
It's painful watching him now. Hope he goes to Italy or wherever and is rejuvenated.

7486~~~
Stop playing him LVG, at least not from the start anyway

7487~~~
Same here. I really want him to succeed but he's really up against it

7488~~~
It reminds me of watching Best playing for Fulham.....

7489~~~
I think he knows by now that he isn't gonna be here next season.

I really wanted him to make it but it's just not working.

7490~~~
On the brightside......£300k/week better applied elsewhere.

7491~~~
Ah well, it was a bit of craic, wasn't it? That time we signed Falcao on deadline day, a bit of craic.

7492~~~
Like I said, I'm not pro Falcao, I was the same with Young and Felliani. People are too quick to make judgements. It is been agreed by most on here that our football is dire at mo. That's very different to we are creating loads of chances and not taking them. I can't see why people can't seem to make the link with poor performances. Most games I've been to OT, 6 out of the 11 have been really poor.

People like to have scapegoats on here. Falcao not been brilliant but someone tell me in the attacking third, who has been?

7493~~~
He's been terrible. A real shame as he seems like a really good man and had a certain mystique about him upon arrival, I wanted nothing more than for him to be a big hit at United. But it isn't happening and he looks a total shadow of his former self. Frees up space and money for another huge summer signing hopefully.

7494~~~
Yes. If we're looking for a silver lining it's the fact this isn't a tricky decision!

7495~~~
Well, not many (if anyone) anticipated him to be this poor. Even at the beginning of his spell here he showed some glimpses of the old Falcao, hitting the woodwork and assisting van Persie in Leicester game or scoring a winner against Everton. He's actually become worse overtime which makes me think that his drop of form has not been purely down to a lengthy injury.

7496~~~
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he'll go on and score goals in Italy or France next season. But he's been the floppiest flop.

7497~~~
I was excited when he came, was looking forward to seeing him play, but he has been dreadful , not one decent game.
The last 2 games have been some of the worst I have seen a United player in.
The money we are shelling out on him could be better spent.

7498~~~
Wanted him to do well and am a bit gutted it hasn't worked out. That said, we're in no position for charity at this point.

7499~~~
I'm thinking the birth certificate thing may have been true after all. Maybe he's actually 57 or whatever that joker claimed.

7500~~~
Shame indeed. This isn't the club for him, our play the the moment is on his head or trying to get in behind defenders, he can't do either.

7501~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>


His first touch makes it seem like every time he is massively surprised to receive the ball.

7502~~~
He was one of my favourite players. I really wanted him to succeed here but it's just not happened.

7503~~~
I'm realistic that supporters are generally never happy unless they are moaning about someone. You could argue only Blind out of the summer transfers has consistently performed well. Falcao performances haven't been great but it's a least within the context of a team that is equally poor.

7504~~~
Good thing he was loaned here and not purchased.

It's actually 35k less per week if you are to believe the BBC. 300k is probably used because reporters round up because the number sounds better.

7505~~~
So we're taking tonight as the official end then?

7506~~~
He needs to be dropped. We can't just start him and hope he turns into a monster again. He needs momentum and confidence, but it's at the business end of the season now and we can't be that patient.

Bring him on as a sub, and hopefully he'll nab a few goals against a tired defence and that'll raise his confidence.

I still think (and hope) he won't be here next season. I'd love to see him firing on all cylinders for us, but he's holding Wilson back. The latter would have had a lot more game time this season had Falcao been dropped/not played when he's been playing awful.

7507~~~
I said this in early November to <a class="username" data-user="19580, @Pogue Mahone" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19580/">@Pogue Mahone</a> in reply to:
<i>He's certainly not looking like a Shevchenko style flop.</i>

<i>"That's exactly what he looks like. Shevchenko did exactly the same thing when he arrived at Chelsea, oozed class on the ball and was great off it, gets an early goal or two but it never quite comes together for them like it used to and the goals don't come at the rate everyone expects. Their confidence drops and the class on the ball starts to leave them then it all goes to shit. Sometimes you get a bit of a second wind in the following season especially if there is no international tournaments but it never ends up being more than that."</i>

It was and is just so obvious what's happening and why. Being injured doesn't freeze time, players still decline due to age even when they aren't playing and it happens at a quicker rate.

7508~~~
Yep, did you not see him squint at the number board? This auld fella can barely see, let alone play professional football.

7509~~~
I wouldn't say the team is poor, not exciting but
is not poor, efficient but not creating many chances which strikers need to be able to score. Defenders need regular partnerships to develop understandings - it takes time and wherever we finish or whatever happens in the cup, clearly next season will be better in terms of entertainment and performance - if we hadn't had all the injuries in the first part of this season, the performances, understandings etc would have come more quickly

7510~~~
So who's first touch is worse, Falcao or Lukaku?

7511~~~
Lukaku. Both are absolute cloggers, though.

7512~~~
He just offers nothing. Wilson given the time Falcao has had this season would have double Falcaos goals.

7513~~~
Falcao really needs to be played with wingers, where they can cross the ball into him, I honestly  think he'd get back to his best then, he's great with his head and he wouldn't have to be coming back into midfield to get on the ball. He's getting criticised but he's not getting enough chances to score.

7514~~~
Its hard for him to get a chance to score when his first touch normally ends up about 50 yards away from him.

7515~~~
He's trying to hard

7516~~~
Darron Gibson in a wig mate... think about it.

Awful, awful post...

1. He was bad tonight. Even if you want him to stay, to try and make out he was anything other than utterly shocking tonight is actually an insult to the level Falcao used to play at.

2. 'Fanbois' of whom? I don't see anyone making him the scapegoat for anything - just people reacting to his individual performance.

3. Ironically, of all the posts in here, you sound easily the most like a 'hysterical schoolgirl' - you're making out as if there's some kind of conspiracy against Falcao, when in reality he's enjoyed more opportunity under LvG than most other players in our squad despite his woeful form since joining.

And to claim you're <i><b>'still convinced he will come good'</b></i> is bordering on the delusional - 'convinced' would firmly suggest that there's some kind of logic in your belief... so please, share it with us and perhaps we can evolve from being 'scapegoating fanbois' to seeing the higher knowledge that you so obviously possess.

7517~~~
The very definition of a luxury player? Him and RvP up front sounds great, but the results have been there for all to see this season. I'm not explicitly blaming him, but our system just cannot accommodate such a lack of productivity. I have a feeling that when he leaves it will be in acrimonious circumstances, and I very much doubt he (and Mendes) will reference us favorably to the press. Not that we should feel bad though, it's not like he hasn't been given chances and frankly he has been pretty shite. The team looked considerably better after his substitution. Worth a punt for this season, but we should cut our losses. What will be his fate next year though? No way Monaco can afford his wages now, and absolutely no way will anybody pay £40m for him. Where the hell will he end up?

7518~~~
He's gone backwards in the last few games even. I thought he'd turned a corner in the QPR away game where although he was criticised for missing chances, he was at least getting on the end of passes and holding up the ball well. I was hoping he would build on that performance but he's barely influencing games, runs around like a headless chicken, can't get himself free of any defender in the land.

Such a shame but I don't think there is anything he can do from here on to change my mind.

7519~~~
Do you not think that he is to blame when he is not putting himself into positions, which allow a midfielder to pass him the ball, in front of goal?
I've seen many games where Falcao and RVP are static - standing behind an opposition defender; its almost as if they are scared of recieving the ball so the best way to not receive it stand close to a defender.
And the absolute best example of how slow these 2 are, is when we break. Di Maria, Wilson, Rooney are running up field and RVP and Falcao are not even on the same screen. A few seconds later, after the play has stopped (to allow RVP and Falcao to catch up), we see our 2 strikers arriving into shot.

Another example - a few games ago, Paddy McNair of all people ran forward. He brought the ball into the final 3rd of the pitch. Our 2 strikers were once again hiding. In the end he either side passed or went for goal himself (I cant remember which).

Oh and the icing on the cake - the defenders he is struggling to shake off belong to Cambridge and Preston North End - not even Premier League defenders.

When Afro man played as a striker last night, he held up the ball, and slowly took his (double) shot. His strength means that he doesnt need to rush. Falcao simply can't do that - Falcao needs speed of thought, movement and World class technique, which he no longer has.

When you sign a big name player (like Sanchez, Costa, Aguero, Neymar, etc), you need instant impact. If we buy an 18 year old for £18M, we can afford to allow him to mature and come good over a 2-3 year period. When you buy a player for £44M, he will not have time to adjust, this is the very reason why you are paying such a big transfer free - instant impact.

Falcao fans must accept that this was a 1 season loan (experiment), which has not paid off. If Monaco do sell him, it is likely that they would struggle to get more than £15M odd for him (ie. similar to Balotelli's fee), but only time will tell.

7520~~~
I agree completely, he's a player that needs proper service into the box. You are not going to get anything from Falcao playing so deep. We have only got 2 penalties since the season started, they are feeding off scraps in there. We don't have many attempts on goal because we are playing a more continental possession game. We are like a shit Barcelona that play without tempo and lack that killer final ball. I'm really gutted about Falcao to be honest, Southampton was the turning point for me. It was a huge call leaving him out of that game and things haven't been the same since. His body language said it all when he was subbed tonight, his agent Mendes hasn't helped. It's sad because he is a quality player, I wonder where he will go, if/when he leaves.

7521~~~
What (logically) makes you thing this?
He can't shake of Championship defenders - how is he going to shake off Italian defenders who are known to be amongst the best in the World?

7522~~~
He's clearly low on confidence, and we've created very little for him this season. He's been poor, but I think it'd be harsh to leave the blame solely on him. He's not the player he was, that much is becoming increasingly evident, but I don't think his career is over.

7523~~~
Well after today we must've completly ruined his reputation, yet another player whose career has been destroyed by Destroychester United.

NoWinNoFee must be in tears, trembling under his bed.

7524~~~
When Di Maria and Rooney were playing the odd ball through to Falcao today, I can't help but think what might've resulted if Wilson or even RVP was the striker running after it.  Falcao has clearly lost a step (or 2 or 3 or 4) since the injury and he doesn't look anywhere close to getting it back.  He also looks a bit out of sorts playing in England, as he seems to be on his arse every couple of minutes and is slow to react in close-range plays.

I was not happy about signing Falcao to begin with but I've supported him when he's played and hoped that he would making something out of the loan period we've given him.  But this is looking like a flop with each passing day and it would be best for all involved if he moved on somewhere else.

7525~~~
Are some seriously suggesting that we pay £46M for him in the summer? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

7526~~~

7527~~~
Such a shame, he's such a likable guy...

Would have gone on to be a massive crowd favourite if he started banging in goals.

7528~~~
He's clearly abused from a substance <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7529~~~
I'm a massive fan of Falcao (historical Falcao, that is) and wanted this to work as much as anyone, but it just hasn't. No way we can afford to buy him in the summer (even if the price was 5m, as his wages could be better spent elsewhere).

Lacazette, for me, is the one we should be looking at. Or alternatively, a goalscoring wide-player (Depay maybe).

7530~~~
He is running like bobby Carlos doing tippy toe thing at a freekick. Barely any acceleration, he wasn't the quickest but feckin hell. Get rid

7531~~~
I'm genuinely not disputing this, but where does it come from...?

Everyone seems to be saying this a lot since he signed on loan and while I genuinely don't find anything about him actively <i>unlikeable</i>, I don't really understand where the - 'clearly a top lad', 'seems a great guy', 'such a likeable dude' flow of comments come from.

I remember feeling the same way when everyone would talk of Nani having 'a hateable face' and being 'unlikeable', and I couldn't understand why and even mused (in that instance) whether it was some kind of deep, subconscious racism.

But yeah, with Falcao, other than seeming incredibly happy and relieved that he scraped through a last minute medical I don't really understand the 'top bloke' comments. Has he demonstrated a great knowledge of the club and I've missed it or something?

On the pitch he's clearly been very keen to land a contract, and that's understandable, but does it make him a 'great guy'...?

Like I said, I don't find the guy actively unlikeable from the small amount of his personality that's been revealed, but I don't understand what anyone is seeing that leads to so many comments about him being 'an awesome lad'.

With someone like Mata who puts a lot of effort into connecting with fans and is such a giver of good vibes I can understand it, but in this case I can't... 

I do wish Falcao well and to be honest I'd like to see him go to Portugal or the MLS and enjoy some form because I feel for him struggling here like this. But I'm pretty indifferent to his character.

7532~~~
From the interviews in spanish I have seen Falcao is a really polite person. He's really good with the fans, too. Really passionate about the sport and representing his country. He cried when he gave an interview after it was announced he was sold to Monaco. 
We never really know about footballer's personal life (Giggs anyone?) but on the pitch and in public he's class.

7533~~~
He's slow as buggery and doesn't work hard enough to make up for it.

7534~~~
It's painful watching him labor across the field. The first touch is pathetic, and he is easily out paced by opposition players.

7535~~~
As much as I've criticized I feel really sorry for him. You can see he's trying hard and wants to play for the club but it just isn't working out. Real shame!

7536~~~
Couldn't this be said about almost all high profile players though?

Cleverly, for example, didn't have an endless flow of 'thoroughly decent and good chap' comments through his time here.

More topically, Di Maria, who's a 'loving family man' rarely seems to fall into the 'whadda guy' category for most posters.

I'm not opposed to it, just find it a bit weird.

7537~~~
Then we don't need a striker like him, it's not like we are going to improve our football ten fold within a year or so. Yes, we might start playing with more cohesion and fluidity but ultimately it will take us 2-3 years at least before we end up with a system that supports forwards with multiple perfect passes a game. Right now we need a game changer up front, someone who creates something out of nothing. The likes of Aguero, Suarez, Henry don't or didn't need a thousand perfect passes for a ready made tap in to score goals, they went out there and created opportunities for themselves which is what we need from our forwards at the minute. Falcao hasn't even been close to doing that.

7538~~~
Falcao is a top bloke, but he's lost that extra something.  Time to move on and give Wilson those minutes.

7539~~~
I just think his injury has set him back and he knows that for the first time in a long time hes second choice.  Hes trying to hard to link up and he just seems rusty.  I think a game like today would have suited him to stay on but saying that we looked far more dangerous with him off the field.  Although we were starting to groove and push up with linking more than one pass together

7540~~~
At least 2-3 years? This makes BR a magician at Liverpool. I also don't think this crap football is going to be tolerated that long.

7541~~~
Really disappointed with him - didn't expect him to make an instant impact, but still expected him to make one. Looked like a good player at the start despite looking unfit; his hard work, movement and holdup play was very good, although his first touch and finishing were below average - I felt in time, he will get this all back - once he regains confidence. Issues such as United not given him a contract or LVG not using him (both justified in hindsight) seem to lower his confidence more and more, and it appears he has played worse and worse in result of this. 

Since being dropped for the Southampton game, I think his confidence has dropped even more and his game play has worsened. Since that game, my two memories of him were the hat trick of misses (against QPR?) and the West Ham miss - I don't even remember his goal against Leicester. The West Ham miss was dreadful, but he was still there for the chances, and the goals will eventually come, as he is (was) a top quality striker. The more I see of him, the less confident I am, and it is to a point where I am almost certain that he won't be here next season. My second thoughts were that he needed a quicker striker partnering him, as him and RVP were just not working; he played with Rooney today, who despite not being great, still had a lot of chances; this was the worst I had seen of Falcao today, so having a quicker striker in Rooney didn't seem to do the trick either. There were some times where he held up the ball well outside the box, but for a 40m striker, you expect him doing that inside the box. My only other memory of him in today's match (other than him being subbed) was when Di Maria went for a one-two with him, but Falcao's first touch screwed it up. There seems to be players that bully the lesser teams - but Falcao doesn't seem like one of those players (not this Falcao anyway); his worst games always seem to be against FA Cup opponents. 

Unlike the others, I don't think of him as a rubbish striker - I am more than happy if he continue getting chances and I hope he can prove us all wrong. I don't think he is like RVP, where he could win us games even when we weren't playing well, but I think if we were playing well, Falcao will be a 20+ Goals per season striker. Unfortunately, that seems unlikely this season and if it happens next season, I doubt Falcao will still be at the club. I do see pictures of Falcao wearing glasses off the pitch, and wearing contact lenses myself, there are times during games where I can't see the scoreboard - so I will give him the benefit of the doubt here.

7542~~~
I think it's going to be a very long term project here before anything respectable can be achieved unfortunately. We're 7 months into van Gaal's tenure and the improvement in the quality of football just isn't there, he's taking a pragmatic approach that he took at Netherlands during the World Cup and putting results above style. I think he might eventually have us playing better brand of football but it ultimately won't be until we hire Guardiola (which will happen around 2018 IMO) that we start being properly good on the eye and support our forward line with plenty of service.

7543~~~
It's heartbreaking to see such a talented footballer get wrecked by injury, but that seem to be the case here. We made excuses for him for a long time, but he has shown zero signs of improvement in his time here. The same can be said about RvP really. Anyone thinking he is the same player he was 2-3 years ago are fooling themselves.

Also the "lack of service" argument does not hold water. Top, top strikers (the ones we should aspire to get) take the "scraps" and makes a meal out of them. In Fergie's last season we played just as shite, but RvP showed a perfect example of what a  top striker could do with these scraps. 

Also another thing a modern striker needs, is the ability to run at defenders, and create chances for themselves (unless you are some RvNesque demi-god). As it stands now, none of our senior strikers (even Rooney) has that ability. Wilson has it to some degree, but he is very much a diamond in the rough.

The point of this rambling mess: We REALLY need a striker this summer

7544~~~
You have it all planned out. Who is going to be our coach after Pep?

This lack of service crap needs to go now. His first touch ruins most the build up and can't hold the ball up. He doesn't attempt to run in behind. He doesn't win any headers in the box because Di Maria at times has put in some brilliant crosses. 

He is worse than Torres ever was at Chelsea atm. Torres wasn't this bad when it came to build up. He'd also take on a defence and then miss.

7545~~~
I don't actually think Falcao's wrecked, I just think he's a one dimensional striker approaching 30 (or over it, depending on what you believe...) who's lost a yard of pace and has turned up to the wrong league at the wrong time of his career.

The English game is too fast and physical for him, but I really do think that somewhere like Portugal, the MLS or maybe even Italy Falcao could enjoy 2 or 3 decent seasons being paid more money than any of us will ever see playing football in the sunshine. It's hardly a sob story.

He's entrusted his career to Mendes, the man who moved him from Madrid to Monaco, and then from Monaco to the PL, and now he needs to make sure that the next move is what's best for HIM - because so far it seems that he's really just a cash cow for Mendes to cart around from league to league.

7546~~~
Don't know, the timing of this is just too perfect. Van Gaal has a three years contract which runs out exactly when Pep's deal with Bayern comes to a close (provided he uses that one-year extension option he has in his deal) and it would be the third time Pep manages a team that was previously managed by van Gaal not that long before and largely founded on van Gaal's 'philosophy'. I don't really see a better scenario than giving Pep a go after van Gaal is done with his job here (unless we struggle massively and van Gaal gets the boot before his contract expires).

Agreed about the lack of service nonsense.

7547~~~
I've heard a few of his interviews, especially some of the ones after he joined us - he seems very religious and down to earth, and also only had really good things to say about the club. 

I agree with your point though - we don't know much about these footballers - but i guess we can only make a little assumption based on the very little we do see/know/hear.

Very sad that he's not even half the player he used to be, but he should be nowhere near starting. Rooney up top alone, please.

7548~~~
In a perverse way though at least he's making what could have been a really tricky decision over whether or not he was worth buying an easy one.

It's one less difficult decision for Van Gaal to make over the Summer.

7549~~~
Falcao might be that player. I've said it before, in years gone by a new player came to the club from a different country and league, people would say it takes you a season for you and your family to settle in so many ways. This means your not going to necessarily see the best in a player in his first season and it doesn't matter what you paid or paying him, it takes time. You could argue that's the same for LVG who I think underestimated the difficulties in English football.
This aside, the player had a serious injury. Look at other players rehab, he was rushed back too soon and in essence is doing his rehab at utd. Utd took a massive gamble cause they know if Falcao arrived a fit player with a half decent WC under his belt, he wouldn't be here. Equally they know, if they are patient, they may have a WC striker for 30m less than he's worth. Only time will tell, and that needs to be more than what we are giving at the moment.
Like I said, if the team was firing and he was missing chances but that's not the case. Yes he's missed them but look at the ratio of opportunities. Very little chances created, the final balls are poor as are the crosses. The build up is slow.
He may never be the player but it's too early to make an assessment.

7550~~~
<a class="username" data-user="87069, @JUPITER" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87069/">@JUPITER</a> 
I suggest you read numerous articles about him outside of the pitch and the work he puts into charity in Columbia.

7551~~~
I heard a ridiculous conspiracy theory that the real Radamel was unable to recover from his knee injury and that he has now been swapped with his identical twin brother Eduardo, a footballing journeyman who played for Columbian second tier club Real Cartagena until he retired at the end of last season to become a sports promoter.

7552~~~
I kinds agree but he hasn't got time he's got a one season loan to impress. Time is running out

7553~~~
He is not the first player to struggle in the United shirt. 

He needs to show character and fight, he might not have much pace but at the moment he is getting nowhere near the ball when it comes into the box.

7554~~~
The last time I played football, it was a team game. It's an absolute joke to make references to strikers that had players of equal quality around them. Falcao was of the highest quality and could be compared to the vest best out there. The injury might have taken its toil, that I'm unsure about. 

I'm sorry but for Falcao to score the number of goals per ratio of chances (not games) it would be 1 goal per 2 chances, and there's no footballer in the world who can do that.

Sorry, look at the wingers and wing backs weve previously had at this club, are you telling me that the awesome strikers we've had would have score the same level of goals without Giggs, Beckham, Ronaldo, Neville, Irwin et al.....

7555~~~
That's awesome, I didn't realise he did an anomalous amount of charity work and that's what people were referring to. 

I've always had major respect for Bellamy, Wilshere and Drogba's charity work (see below) as it genuinely seems to go above and beyond at times and clearly means a lot to them.

7556~~~
If he weren't missing sitters you'd have a point. He's had plenty of chances here and he's missed most of them.

7557~~~
I think this is actually the most telling attribute. Forget his awful first touch and his lack of pace, he looks so timid in the air and afraid to tussle physically with defenders. He also seems to have lost a spring in his step - quite literally. Real signs of a steeply declining player.

7558~~~
He isn’t the scapegoat he just isn’t very good and shouldn’t be starting games based on his performances and fact he seems to be getting worse rather than improving. You make the point about service and of course any striker is going to have more opportunities with better service but I fail to see how that explains his lack of movement, mobility, pace, why he gets knocked off the ball too often and why he can’t control the ball. 

You also aren’t taking into consideration that Costa gets on the end of more of that service because he is faster, stronger, better on the ground, better in the air, works harder and creates opportunities for himself. Falcao has had 3 serious knee injuries and came back way to early from the last one, he is nothing like the player he used to be, signing him isn’t even an option and the question now should be whether we play him or not. On current form the answer is a resounding no and we will be better off without him in the side unless he improves dramatically in a very short space of time.

7559~~~
His heart is at Real Madrid!

7560~~~
All this criticism of Falcao is utter BS! While he was on the pitch we played with 2 strikers and he wasn't great and neither was Rooney, you can say both players up until that point were poor, so what changed? The formation and this this is what is all about, width and having a CM pairing.
We started with 2 striker and we didn't play to either of their strengths, instead of playing to the strengths of 2 world class players we played to the strengths of a mop, its diabolical to say the least, pathetic and desperate tactics which were shown by LVG. You have a mop central while your 2 WC strikers are picking the ball out wide, what the f*** is that about.
We have seen over the years how effective Rooney has been as CF/#10, not great but effective and over the years we have seen how Falcao has been 1 of the best #9 as a lone striker, its quite simple really, play them 2 player in the position they are most effective, simple.
You want to get the best out of Rooney = #10. You want the best out of Falcao = #9.
I could bet my money on it Falcao was over the moon when he saw Young coming on, thinking finally were going to play football to his strengths instead of lumping it to this joke of a lamp post but he forget this is LVG, the stubborn ******. IMO if Fellaini had gone off instead of Falcao we still would have won and in the process we would have played better doing so.
All of what we saw and realised against Preston means nothing, playing better with wide players and a CM pairing means jack all because it will be back to the diamond or 352 for the next game, LVG just too stubborn. Rant over.

7561~~~
That's strange. Because I swear we played better when Falcao went off.

And how many good crosses has Di Maria put in the past month. How many has Falcao won? When Young was fit he put in lots of good crosses too and Falcao scored like one against Villa. 

Also paragraphs please.

7562~~~
I'm more concerned by where his first touch is.

7563~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

This really shows what a touch league PL is. Who knows, maybe even Messi would look average in england <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

7564~~~
Games are thinning out and he's still yet to produce anything which I think Hernandez couldnt do, or Wilson, or an off form RVP. 

Still needs that big game where he dominates an opposition which may strike him back into form, but I think its prob too late.

7565~~~
Glad you worded it as you did - yes yours is an awful post - it is very difficult to score without the ball, perhaps you should read some of the other posts of mine and other posters but whch you choose to ignore

7566~~~
If Fellaini is a mop then current Falcao is a walking sack of shit. Is it LVG or Fellaini's fault that Falcao has absolutely no first touch? The ball always bounces off him so he has to chase it. And don't call him world class striker because he's far from one this season, he could've been one in his Atletico days but that was what, 3 years ago?

As shown in the pictures from yesterday, with a lot of mockery, I doubt Falcao was over the moon because he couldn't see jack's shit, as proved on the pitch to be fair. And seriously, keep throwing childish names at Fellaini but you can't change the fact that both him and Herrera have as many goals as our 'world class' striker', they both contribute more to the team and Falcao, instead of feeling RVP or Rooney's breath on his neck, is feeling Smalling's Colgate because he's scored 3 goals himself. So much for a world class striker.

7567~~~
Sorry disagree. Not had plenty cause we haven't created that many. Everything at Man U is always magnified. How many chances are Chelsea, City, Tottenham creating per game? What's the quality of our passing and crossing is shocking so where are all these chances coming from. Are people really expecting him to score a goal every couple of chances? Strikers miss more than they score. Yes there have been some high profile misses but thats the same for all strikers.

It's always the same in football, when things aren't great, someone's always the scapegoat and people want a quick fix. If Chelsea win it this year, that was a 5year wait.....there is no quick fix in football. Let's be patient and see where it takes us. For example, we have one of the best goalkeepers in the world that many on here would have sold after his first season. Two players contributed to winning us the game yesterday that if most had their way on here wouldn't even be in a utd shirt.

7568~~~
Uhm, that's what you'd normally expect from your <i>striker</i>? Especially if you pay him above 200(probably above 250 but whatever) thousand quid per week and buying him will cost you around bloody 50 mln quid?

As for the last part of your post, are you suggesting that we should actually buy him out from Monaco? On what basis really?

7569~~~
Falcao has been disappointing, but can we please remember he is a loan player? Also, what happened to giving a foreign player time to adapt to the Premier League?

The criticism of Falcao is excessive, but I agree absolutely he hasn't shown much of his previous form at United.

However, I also think RvP has been mediocre this season.

Lucky we have Rooney...

7570~~~
In Spain teams don't close the space as fast as they do in PL they are well organised, they can be very aggressive, but you have a little bit of time to control the ball.
At the top a good first touch is crucial in England.

7571~~~
On the premise, who is good in the team over the last 10 games? RVP, Rooney in midfield, Di Maria, anyone at the back bar Shaw? Sorry the performances as a team have been dire so yes to isolate one player makes no sense. 

His movement has been his strong point imo but you need quality of the pass to match the movement. You see when you look negatively at anyone, you'll always see the things you don't like. He's been as good as he has been bad. He's had good and bad moments but he's contibuted with assists and goals. 
For me his attitude has been very good and he gives 100%. That's a player who's trying very hard. Now that might not be good enough but that's the least you'd expect from a utd player. 

Costa is playing in a very good Chelsea team but Real or Barca weren't fighting for his signature. He's a very good player but not world class. Let's see what Falcao is like when we are playing better football because Costa would look very poor in this team as its only creating 4-5 chances a game hence our lack of goals.

7572~~~
Put down your Joypad its not FIFA 15. No striker scores goals at that ratio consistently. I'm not suggesting anything other than its too soon to make any assessment. The guys been here 6 months, probably 3 of which he was recovering or injured. Let's be realistic, he's not bloody Roy of the Rovers.....

7573~~~
His ratio is one goal every 286 minutes. Let's be realistic, that's fecking shit.

7574~~~
He's on loan, he doesn't have time to adapt. Either he delivers the goods or we get rid.

7575~~~
If I was Mendes, or Monaco, or whoever holds his contract, I'd pay handsomely to cut his loan deal short and get him back in Ligue 1. Every game he plays with us his stock falls a little further.

If Welbeck is worth £16m, you couldn't say Falcao is worth any more than about £10m at the moment - a fifth of what he was supposedly worth at the start of the season.

I am very worried that we have, in fact, signed him permanently already, and the arrangement we had was to appease book-keepers either at our end or Monaco's end. That might better he's reason why van Gaal is persisting with him so.

7576~~~
You can play a great pass but if the guy your playing it too can’t run then that’s no good either and to be fair his movement is nothing special, he tries spinning in behind but can’t out run anyone, he comes short but it’s hit and miss whether he can control it or not and he can’t turn his man. He is a goal poacher whose 3 serious knee injuries have caught up with him, he has only experienced being the focal point in teams and his limitations as well as his decline are being exposed.

I think it is laughable to suggest Costa wouldn’t do better in this side, he wouldn’t be as prolific as he has been at Chelsea but he would have scored a lot more than 4. Also don’t understand the argument about the top sides not wanting Costa, which ones wanted Falcao? He went to Monaco and was being offered to anyone who would take him in the summer and I think it is pretty obvious that any manager would rather have Costa than Falcao now, 2 years ago it would have been different but things change.

There are plenty of under performers but at this moment in time he is the worst and he deserves to be dropped, there is no argument against that, persisting with him is a pointless, he won’t be here next season, he isn’t improving and we have other players who can come in and improve the team

7577~~~
One thing's for sure. He's been an absolute fecking albatross around Van Gaal's neck this season. He has to give him as much chance as possible to see if he can get back to his best and every time he drops him Mendes starts bleating. The same Mendes we're locked in lengthy negotiations with about extending the contract of our best player this season. Must be a huge headache he could really have done without.

7578~~~
I suppose that raises the issue of whether he wanted Falcao, in which case it's difficult to have that much sympathy, whether he didn't push for him but was passive when it was mooted, which is something that may well have been the case with Herrera, or whether he had no choice in the matter, in which case it's pretty apparent our DOF is Mendes, using Woody as his faithful, albeit dumb, personal assistant (who looks like a troll with short hair).

7579~~~
We'll never know which scenario is the right one but Woody has been bulling for a "galactico" signing ever since he took the reins, so it does seem likely he was the whip hand here. And, as you say, exactly the kind of monied newbie CEO that Mendes could play like a fiddle.

7580~~~
Yeah. This media line of us cosying up to Mendes sort of ignores the fact that it's just as likely he was very keen to get his hooks into us at a time when we had money to spend, a new, possibly easily led executive vice chairman (as a matter of interest, why isn't he chairman?) and a squad with lots of holes.  

Mendes saw the opportunity, I suspect and was more than receptive to our advances.

7581~~~
Absolutely. It was an ambitious gamble that has ultimately failed. We should use him from the bench from now on, where perhaps fresh legs against a tiring defence won't make him look like he's running through treacle. Van Gaal has given him more than enough time to prove he's worth the £40m~ fee and short of turning into Messi for the remainder of the season he is bound to fall short of this valuation. 

If he scores the winner from the bench against Arsenal in the next round or in an important PL game that could be the difference between getting 4th he'll be remembered fondly.

7582~~~
Have to feel for him... he's gone from World Class to being genuinely terrible at football.

He's a footballing experiment we can't afford to keep using.

7583~~~
I am genuinely shocked by how bad Falcao has been. Some players just can't adapt to the speed and physicality of the premiership though.

I fully expect him to play in Europe next year and be awesome again. Remember Forlan? Terrible for us, but amazing in Spain.

7584~~~
It's absolutely disastrous for any striker, let alone one with his reputation and salary. 

He has had his recovery time and his time to "get used to the league" (didn't take Costa long did it?) and he still hasn't performed. Rooney looked better than him last night, before and after the change of formation. 

Once RvP is back it will be him and Rooney up front, I don't think LvG fully trusts Wilson yet but I would have even him over Falcao at this stage.

7585~~~
When it's for a huge amount of money, for a guy who's 29. Time? He needed to make an impact immediately.

7586~~~
I said to my City supporting mate that he would finish the season with more goals than Aguero. I was half-joking to wind him up but I never imagined it would be this bad. Luckily, said City fan doesn't seem to remember me saying this so it looks as if I'm off the hook!

Thinking about it, I have a made some awful predictions in my time. I have no idea how any of my colleagues/friends take my opinion on football seriously!

7587~~~
While he's looked like complete shit so far, I wouldn't be surprised if he found much better form after changing the way the team plays. He's not the only one looking bad this season. I actually have a hard time finding anybody in the team looking good so far, everybody is performing below par so far.

7588~~~
It seems like the opposite. I think it's clear to Falcao we're not too keen on him, so he's now not putting the effort in at all.

7589~~~
I can't see any reason why he should start any further games for us, but he will though won't he? It's a shame because he was a beast of a striker in the not too distant past and now he looks out of his depth against League 1 & 2 sides. A Torres-esque fall from grace.

7590~~~
He's getting hammered on here but I'd personally still have Falcao above Van Persie in my striker hierarchy at the moment, at least he puts in a shift and tries to make stuff happen.

edit - not to say Falcao should start, personally I'd drop both of them

7591~~~
And RvP actually makes something happen occasionaly, his touch is better, better hold up and link up play and he actually scores goals, and not only the crappy ones.

7592~~~
That's nonsense about RVP. Pretty sure there was a stat saying RVP was covering more distance. Also RVP doesn't get his agent to talk in the media, when he's not playing.

7593~~~
I feel sorry for him. He's obviously giving his all and desperate to prove himself and how good he can be, but it's just not working at all. He has to go in the summer.

7594~~~
I don't think there's any questions over him being done here, I just worry what sort of gentleman's agreement we have in place over his play time. The powers of Mendes. 

We'd be wrong to piss Mendes off and if we were to drop Falcao, like we should, it would be absolutely disasterous for him in regards to getting a contract somewhere next year. Can we really afford to piss off the agent of De Gea, Di Maria and so many potential great signings... or can we afford not to?

7595~~~
not a chance - RVP is better than he is. falcao can't bring a football down let alone bury it. mr. tap in and ffs he doesn't even do that consistently.

7596~~~
I very much doubt this is on our/the managers mind, and rightfully so.

It makes no sense too, what's Mendes done for us this summer? He made a lot of cash by us overpaying for Di Maria. He brought Costa to our rivals, gave us Falcao - now if it were the other way around he might've done us a favour.

Did Mendes help us with Ando, I don't think so? Did he help us with Nani? Because the last time I checked we are paying most of his wages, yet there was no discount on Rojo? Is Mendes making us get Cristiano back? Yes he helped us getting De Gea, but we payed a huge fee for him didn't we? I don't know about potential great signings, but we don't need a whole new squad. And there are loads of world class players out there who aren't represented by Mendes.

If anything it's the other way around, especially with the FFP, we are one of the richest clubs in the world. And Mendes is the one who should be happy that we are in business with him. And so far he's probably helped Real Madrid more and Chelsea/Mourinho at least as much as he helped us.


As for Falcao, my assesment when he signed for us was that he wasn't as good as an overall striker or player as Rooney or RVP, yet out of those three he was probably the best 'pure poacher'. I quite liked this, because it gives us more/different options.

His first touch was pretty awful when he was top scorer at Atletico too, so it makes no sense at all to judge him on that. His strong point is his finishing. Which makes him useless in our team, we've been creating feck all for big parts of the whole season. Rooney had 0 shots on target from open play yesterday, same for RVP last week, Falcao was invisible in the last two matches. Not because they are piss poor players as some people on here suggest, but because our team can't create proper chances against a lower league team or Burnley at home at the moment.

Van Gaal should only use Falcao if he thinks we're actually going to create some chances for him. But then again, he probably didn't expect us to create nothing while playing against a lower league side like yesterday. I don't really care what happens to Falcao and if he doesn't make it here, fine by me. Let Mendes bring him to AC Milan or whatever 'top 7 club in the world'  he was talking about. But I wouldn't be surprised if Falcao scores some good goals for us the moment we actually start creating something, because to me he doesn't look that different compared to before his injuries.

7597~~~
Exactly. It's true that you need to keep good relationships with powerful agents, but this is by no means a one-way thing. If he suddenly finds that he can't deal with United, what does that do for his reputation as an agent? Who would want to sign up with an agent who can't find you the best deals? You need to at least have the possibility of taking a player to United.

Besides, Falcao's performances are simply too poor to dispute. It's not a close run thing where we're not giving him the benefit of the doubt but someone else might. He's been abject in the last couple of games and I think LVG has been generous to give him as many games as he has done.

7598~~~
Its stats like this that show you don't have a clue. How many goals have we been scoring lately? how well have we played? How many chances have been created? Its goes on and on... We are not getting the best out of him and nor are we getting the best out of any of our forward players. Change the set up to put our best team out in the position that they excel in and then judge.

7599~~~
It's posts like this that show you don't have a clue. How many easy chances has he fecked up? How badly has he played? How many chances does he need to actually score a goal? It goes on and on. We're not getting the best out of anybody in our squad yet RVP and Rooney managed to score moe goals than him, Herrera and Fellaini, despite being midfielders, managed to get the same amount of goals as him. 

Yesterday we've probably had the best attacking/service players on the pitch, maybe only Mata was missing. He's done feck all and looked the worst of the bunch. 0 runs, 0 shots on target, contributed absolutely noting. Rooney made a couple of runs behind the defence and it was either him or ADM's service that didn't click in the end but at least he was doing something. 

One goal per 286 minutes, it's one goal per more than three matches, let that sink in. He's a goner at the end of the season, nothing personal against the guy himself, seems like a very likeable lad but he's been a woeful striker for us. His one year loan had a pretty simple rule: either deliver or you're gone. He didn't deliver obviously.

7600~~~
I dont like digging the lad, but I had a quick look back through his recent stats. Not pretty. He's not had a single shot on target in three games now. He's only managed 3 shots in the last 3 games, all off target. That is simply dire.

This would be the biggest comeback since Lazarus if he plays his way to a transfer at this point.

7601~~~
Seems to be a confidence issue with him (much as it is with Nani). A few goals and many will likely follow, although its a bit late at this point. He would have to put in a few ridiculous performances and show a clear aptitude towards continuing that way next year for LvG to consider keeping him.

7602~~~
Why did he contribute nothing? How many times did look for him in box? All we did while he was on the pitch was hoof the ball to Fellaini, that is all we did nothing more. This is how deluded you are, poster like you praise Fellaini for yesterday when forget that he was god awful until the formation change. He constantly gave the ball away, couldn't hold onto the ball, couldn't pass, didnt win any Ariel duals, got pushed off the ball for fun but still labeled as the MOTM, Fellaini was 1 of the worst players on the pitch, absolute s*** until the formation change but we'll forget that because he scored a goal, it was all Fellaini who got is the equaliser and Rooney's penalty wasn't it? No its was the formation that would have suited falcao, next game that's what we should play, Falcao as a lone striker then judge him

7603~~~
So now nobody's passing to him? Everybody's literally pretending that he's not there? You're pretty silly to call me deluded when you're coming up with the bolded part, none of which is true and such bullshit as 'couldn't pass' (90% accuracy with 49 passes) and 'didn't win any aerial duels' (unless you mean Ariel from The Little Mermaid) can be easily dispelled with statistics that are well available. Keep telling yourself that Fellaini did feck all but it still didn't stop him from having 4 shots, 2 of which were on target.

Another thing is that even compared to Rooney Falcao looked bad yesterday. He's had just 26 touches (compared to Rooney's 60) and made just 18 passes (compared to Rooney's 47) so it just shows you that he's the one hiding from the play.

And we should change the system to suit Falcao because of what? You usually try to play to your strengths, unless we're all pretending to be retarded now nobody will claim that a striker that scored 4 goals for us is our 'strength'. Yesterday's system wasn't playing to Rooney or Fellaini's strengths either but somehow they both managed to be echelons above Falcao in terms of being useful. And it was hardly down to their perfect games, it was just Falcao who was that shit in yet another game. And yea, it was all Fellaini because he gave us another win (alongside Herrera who got us level and let us push on) while Falcao gave us virtually nothing.

7604~~~
Hmmm right now I'm thinking Wilson is our only on form striker. Bar the penalty Rooney did little. But was still better than Falcao or RvP have been the past 4 weeks. It's sad as he was looking much better when he was being used as a sub - since he's started the past month he's gotten progressively worse - one suspects he's still far from match fit and having to play so deep (which was never a facet of his game) is also an issue.

7605~~~
Agree with all of that bar your last sentence, but only because of his loan status. He will go in the summer when his loan expires. I'd be shocked if it played out any other way.

7606~~~
I don't know how that's disagreeing with me Dwayne? What I meant is that he'll go <i>because</i> the loan will expire and we hopefully won't pay the cash to land him.

7607~~~
I disagreed with your wording I suppose as to me it read like we already have him on a permanent deal. Stupid loan agreement.

7608~~~
I disagree with your face.

No, no, that's a lie, your face is lovely, I'm just emotional right now.

7609~~~
Get stats for 60 mins of Rooney, Fellaini and Falcao and compare

7610~~~
Sorry. Loved the face based retort, though. One of my personal favorites.

7611~~~
If Mendes really has something to do with this, he should tell van Gaal to stop playing him. At this rate no European top league team will take him at the end of the season.

7612~~~
I hope he succeeds here. Slim chance, but there is still a chance.

7613~~~
How did you interpret his gesture when he was subbed yesterday? Was he just making sure, or was he actually trying to say 'Are you seriously substituting <i>me</i>?' If it's the latter, that's hilarious.

7614~~~
The latter, I think.  Surely he can see the board with '9' on it?

van Gaal should've gotten off the bench and said 'Yes...You!!'

7615~~~
I think he was making sure cause when the board was up I thought it said number 8 and was like you got wrong number up mate.

7616~~~
How can he be so crap? He used to be so good <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

7617~~~
There is a chance, zero chance. The guy is getting worse week by week. Has to go.

7618~~~
Pretty sure it was the latter <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7619~~~
It was also Ashley Young who was coming on, so there's a good chance that he might have been confused. Somebody posted a previous clip from his Monaco days where he did something similar, so there's that.

7620~~~
At one point I thought, "Maybe he needs glasses? THAT'S what's wrong."

7621~~~
I'm gutted for him and I'm gutted for Law who seems to have alot of faith in him.

7622~~~
Its taken us 12 years to replace forlan. He is now back, with dark hair.

7623~~~
It's becoming a bit worrying that LVG persists in starting him regardless, I could understand it if he was 'playing him into form' but he's getting worse, that said, I wonder how he would have fared if Young came on for Fellaini and he had the service that Fellaini had.

7624~~~
This pretty sums up how I feel about Falcao right now.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_Gn7TEEB-M?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Just substitute the shoes for a World Class Striker.

7625~~~
There is still the slightest of chances he isn't over that knee injury he suffered and missing the whole summer with it wouldn't have helped. In all likeliness he's never going to recover and become the player he once was unfortunately.

7626~~~
You're right, there is a chance. It's unlikely but could still happen.

What I would say though, is that he doesn't deserve starts at this point, and should go back to 20 minute cameos against tired defences.

I really think this is best for him, for Mendes (Falcao will look better in this role), and most importantly for us.

7627~~~
I think it's ingenious to claim that LvG's hands are tied because of demands from Mendes and Woodward. This isn't some random no mark Tim Sherwood we are talking about here (with all due respect to him, he's an young and upcoming manager). It's Louis Van Gaal who goes and fights with Bayern's board and is known to be a big autocrat/dictator etc. 

Any manager worth his salt would walk out on the job if there's an agent demanding to play his client at the expense of the team. It's an insult to our club if we think our board will let this happen to our manager being at the mercy of an agent (even if he's a super agent like Mendes). We are not Vitesse Arnhem for god's sake, we are Manchester United. 

If LvG plays Falcao, it could be very well because he's a stubborn so and so, or he feels that he's a part of next year's plans and the results have been good to him to continue his experiments. Anyone who thinks that Falcao is being played because DDG/Mendes/Woodward has their heads so firmly up their own pessimistic arses they could see Noodlehair from where they are at.

7628~~~
All true, but watching Mendes pull an immediate media tantrum when Falcao was dropped for 1 match certainly suggests that LvG is under pressure to play Falcao.

Likewise, seeing a manager so famed for his 'balance' putting out a team with two number 9s tripping over each other and another striker in midfield is, to say the least, oddly uncharacteristic for Van Gaal's entire career.

7629~~~
I would at least like to think that while the agents would try to do their best to put pressure on the manager, LvG has the balls to play his team and our board will back our manager to the fullest.

7630~~~
Likewise, so would I.

I suppose in the coming games we'll see. Falcao should still be given minutes where possible, but he shouldn't be starting matches in this form.

7631~~~
I'd take Cavani over signing Falcao permanently. Ideally, neither happens.

7632~~~
Cavani is really not that great

7633~~~
Yeah, Falcao isn't too. Think Cavani would offer us more though. But as I said, I hope we don't sign anyone and just give Wilson space to grow.

7634~~~
Given how poor he has been here - and he has been poor - Monaco must be starting to think they are going to have a big dilemma on their hands come the end of the season.  Unless he starts banging in the in over the next 3 months (highly unlikely given I think his starts and game time will be less now) then no team is going to go near him on those wages.  No team are going to part with anything upwards of 20m for him (and I think that is pretty fecking generous). Mendes is clearly worried hence the comments to the media of late.
Also, I read that people are saying we aren't playing to his strengths - what are we paying such hefty wages for? A one dimension striker?  He has been garbage and it's no joke when I say Bebe has a better first touch and control.

7635~~~
Ivanovic scores more than him.

7636~~~
We need to sign a striker though

7637~~~
I really don't see what he did last night that was so bad. He didn't have any chances and I can't think of many occasions he gave it away or misplaced his pass. I assume it is more to do with his replacement having such a positive impact rather than how poor Falcao was. His performances get really exaggerated.

I remember RVP against Hull earlier this season when he gave the ball away maybe 10 times and couldn't put a foot right until he smashed that goal in just before going off and he didn't get nearly as much stick. Or his 9 touches or whatever it was against Arsenal.

7638~~~
Not really, his touch has deserted him. He's positively getting worse game by game, to the extent I think Wilson now should start ahead of him.

7639~~~
Wilson has been equally as anonymous when he has started.

7640~~~
This would be the problem then, no blood getting into his brain.

7641~~~
I think the problem has been when both he and RVP have started together, neither have been able to get in the game. 

At times its like we are playing with only 8 outfield players which of course is easy to defend against, and so we don't create chances for the two finishers playing up front. Contrast that with last night where Rooney played up front. He gets involved in the link up and hence we look more threatening. And yes, I know it was only Preston.

7642~~~
The way he has been playing I can't see United paying around £45m to sign him permanently.  If fact I can't see any team willing to pay that much.  If we don't decide to buy him out right is there an option to take him on another loan?

7643~~~
If you had to choose between Falcao and Fellaini tomorrow who would you choose?

7644~~~

7645~~~
Only an idiot would pick Falcao to be honest.

7646~~~
6 months of being in a utd shirt, 3 of which he wasn't fit or injured. New country, new culture, new league, new team mates, new manager, new formation, not having a run of games and we expect him to hit the ground running when by our own addmission the football we are playing is poor, slow and without creativity?

And people think he's not being used as a scapegoat....really? The worlds gone absolutely mad.

7647~~~
I mean, it's not unfair to say he's been a major disappointment, regardless of such reasons you listed.

7648~~~
I would agree but there's just nothing to suggest he's going to turn it around. He just looks lost out there. Way off the pace. Unless the deal was indeed done last summer there's not a chance in hell of us signing him.

7649~~~
Generally speaking, and especially in football, a scapegoat is reacted to with genuine anger and blamed for a failing <i>beyond their own</i> - winking Ronaldo at the world cup, Beckham's red card etc. 

No-one in here is showing any anger, malice or bad intent toward Falcao. Likewise no-one is suggesting that Falcao is responsible for anything other than his own performances. 

People are just really disappointed with what he's contributed and are voicing their opinions more keenly due to the fact that a decision on whether or not to spend 40m on him is likely to be made soon (if not already).

It's important to understand that to criticise or critique is not the same as scapegoating something or someone.

7650~~~
I think this is a very fair summation of how most fans feel.

7651~~~
Just had a daughter according to his twitter.. Maybe this has been a little bit of a distraction for him, specially if this is their first child.. Congrats for the little tiger, obviously..

7652~~~
He was one of the best strikers in the world and now he's playing like an 80 year old version of himself that's also been drugged and gotten drunk. What do you expect us to say?

Do you really think he's going to be amazing or can you admit he's regressed physically due to both age and the major injury to his knee?

7653~~~
Thank you for explaining the term scapegoat within the context of 'especially' in football......not patronising at all. I think I understand the term scapegoat and the context its being used in. Someone's always to blame and unfortunately the usually suspects on here like Felliani or Young aren't playing that badly so the haters have moved onto someone else. They'll always make reference to how much he's cost or being paid, and the focus will always be on what he's not doing rather than what he is. They will always compare them to another player from another team and also quote absolute subjective crap or stats to make their argument fit. 

Sorry but even if I'm the only person who thinks differently on here, he's been here since September. He came here after a serious knee op, he was still in recovery and not played competitive football consistently for sometime. Its a new club, new country, new culture, new players, new league....the teams been changed nearly every week and the teams performance is dire. Only players like 60m Di Maria is a shadow of the player he was at Real and he came here fit. I'm sure h's facing the same issues as other new players. I'm not saying Falcao will be a world beater again, just its too soon to make any judgement in 6 months of football, 3 of which he was injured or coming off the bench for 15 mins football.

7654~~~
Like I said, do you think you can make a fair assessment of a player who's had a run of 6-7 games consistently in a team that's not playing that great anyway? Hows Di Maria's performances based on paying 60m for him?

7655~~~
Because even taking into account every factor he's been absolutely terrible and I don't think he'd be any different back at Monaco, nor at Atletico.

Physically he's done, it's obvious, and if you can't see it then I'm sorry but you need help.

Di Maria has largely been shite.

7656~~~
Guess he now has a Mancunian daughter.

7657~~~
She was in Manchester on Saturday (at Di Maria's birthday party) so it's fair to say yes

7660~~~
Hey man, I totally respect your opinion that Falcao will come good, but my point is that rather than write off other people's opinions as 'scapegoating' him, you'd be better to accept that those opinions are based on his performances alone, and nothing else.

No-one's scapegoating him - there's been an overwhelming (somewhat baffling) flow of, 'such a decent guy' type comments all through this thread. No verbal abuse a la Rooney, Fellaini, Young or Nani.

To accuse people in this thread of scapegoating him is unfair - it'd be like if I turned to you and said, "you only like him cuz you wanna be a t.0.p red", which I don't think, but you get the picture. It would rubbish your opinion as being false or having an agenda.

7661~~~
Seems he really got the p1ss taken out of him on Twitter last night.

Herrera has the same number of goals in all competitions...and Herrera barely plays.
Here's the list: <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/manchester-united-goals-assists-2014-2015.396561/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/manchester-united-goals-assists-2014-2015.396561/</a>

My own order of preference in forward positions, is as follows:

Rooney
RVP
Fellaini
Wilson
Smalling
Falcao

You know you are done as a striker, when a defender is ahead of you (in a forward position) <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

7665~~~
Nah, not saying anyone's is wrong, as nobody's is right. It's not fact or a science and the reality is LVG is playing him anyway, he sees him daily and he picks the team.....I don't like him anymore than any other utd player, I was exactly the same with Felliani when others had their strong views about him, it was too early to comment.

7666~~~
At least we know why he couldn't see the board.......!!!! Mr Falcao wears glasses

7667~~~
He certainly has a very eccentric style of dressing doesn't he <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Great news for him, I just wish he could re-ignite the old Falcao and start blitzing teams away. Feels strange to have Falcao and not want him to play, but right not his form just doesn't deserve a start.

7668~~~
Found myself watching old Falcao at Atletico videos on youtube last night.

If only he was still that player. An absolute monster of a striker.

7669~~~

7670~~~
I know, absolute beast in his day. What jumps out is the range of goals. They're not just all long range efforts. There's every type of goal with both feet.

What strikes me when you watch him now compared to them is that its his confidence that's gone. His best goals rarely rely on being stronger or faster than the opposition. Rather they tend to be incredibly cunning - lots of goals curled in from tight angles, or chipped when you don't expect it, or shots taken really early.

7671~~~
His second goal vs Chelsea when he scored 3 is the best example of this. He stops at the edge of the box, evades a defender, takes a long look at the far corner and beautifully curls it in.

For the people saying he was just a poacher check out his game vs Real in the copa final. Great all round performance and a beautiful asset from the first goal, where he out muscles 2-3 players before playing a great through ball.

7672~~~
Van Gaal should play him as lone cf for some games before discarding him. And with a proper 10 behind.

I think this whole 2 fowards thing just doesn't work for him, and for the rest of the team.

7673~~~
We can't really afford to be risking that.

7674~~~
Bench him please!

7675~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rQED3VRGq2o?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

When you look at this video, his movement was much better, his confidence was up. He was getting better every week and then it just stopped and went backwards. 
heartbreaking cos I was so excited when we got him, im a huge fan. 
But I cant see him staying, unless he has already been told and thats why hes playing as he is?

7676~~~
Nothing could piss me off more than seeing this idiot walking around in his fashion clothes. Just look at those tight jeans with that iphone 6 shining through and that little yellow shopping bag probably worth more than what the average fan earn in a full year of HARD WORK. All my anger of this will eventually be projected on LVG if he don't get his FAT ASS up from the bench and send this piece of GARBAGE back to Monaco in a box before the end of this month!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm 100% sure this kind of treatment is what causes all these losses! Just imagine being the other guy who produce more than Falcao and still get to sit on the bench (Herrera, Mata, Januzaj ETC). THERE ARE PLAYERS WE'VE SENT AWAY THAT PRODUCED MORE THAN YOU EVER DID YOU SHINY BASTARD. Do you realise you're down there with the likes of Bellion, Miller, Djemba Djemba and all you do is post stuff on fecking twitter and walking around with your bought wife?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

7677~~~
What the feck.

Fast, to the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">batmobile</span> Mental Football Forum Posts thread!

7678~~~
You don't need to protect Falcao. He's safe behind his wall of money.

7679~~~
Barking at the wrong tree there, I'm actually his critic but if your post was for real then Jesus, open the window and breathe mate.

7680~~~
Couldn't find the white text, were you high when you posted this or something?

7681~~~
I sincerely hope this is a joke post or you need mental help. One of the worst posts I've ever read if genuine.

7682~~~
You guys need to get your ass to a real football stadium if you think this was bad. My points are fully valid and I'm not taking back a single word of it. The player cut our arms up when asking for his money - now we want what we've been promised. That kind of money = get the business done no matter what. If you guys think he's worth defending then it should be you heading to the mental institution.

7683~~~
Are you seriously a MUFC fan?
Your mentality leads me to believe that you must be a city fan.

7684~~~
You need a doctor.

7685~~~
What the feck are you doing?

7686~~~
scape goated - please where can i sign up. ffs , posters on here are a fickle bunch calling out hernandez , rooney , danny danny danny etc for years. this guy isn't a scapegoat he's a striker that can't score and should be benched. he'll do better in italy for juve at 10-15m plus his huge wages. simply been sold a damaged player. most of it came from our expectations that he'd be our batigol.

7687~~~
Dying <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7688~~~
Oh my...

7689~~~
Trouble is Mendes will probably not want to sell him for £15m. He's a massive asset to him and he probably thinks he can still make a big move, hopefully we've not arranged a deal to sign him for £40m like it was suggested at the time of the loan move completion and we won't let them mug us into the deal.

7690~~~
They should have probably sent him back to Monaco in January while they still could. They're still in the Champions League and he might have had a good game or two against Arsenal which might have rescued him. At United it doesn't look like he's going to find his form back and the pressure to produce is just too big at the minute for him and it's making him play even worse.

7691~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7692~~~
only if teams get fooled. i think he'll be better off in a slower league. players like the stock market rise and fall.

7693~~~
He's still a big name and obviously Mendes will hope to land him last big deal, and pocket a huge commission on the fee in the meantime.

7694~~~
He probably never was, because YouTube video's generally aim to please, not to show a player's weaknesses.

7695~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Check out this gem he posted previously, in a thread called "top brands, fake clobber etc". He seems to have a fixation with designer brands and various expensive stuff. Seemingly only he and a select few others deserve to have any of it, and Falcao clearly isn't in that exclusive club <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Surely he has to be a WUM?

7696~~~
Clearly he's successful by name and successful by nature and is just a cut above the rest of us, including this Colombian wannabe celebrity!

7697~~~
Getting subbed out a goal down against PNE had to be his death knell.  Just bench him for rest of season and let him go back.  Not worth any money.

7698~~~
I found this funnier when I thought it was a joke, but after your follow up posts... Not so much <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

7699~~~
Absolutely loved the 'people who shouldn't be wearing it!!!!' part <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7700~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> No need man.

Falcao isn't even really a United player, and likely won't ever be, so have no idea why you are so mad lol. No way the club could have known he would be this rubbish for us.

If we ended up signing him in the summer and gave him a 4 year contract paying him £280,000 a week based on this season's performances then yeah I would agree with you.

7701~~~
If you're trying to get attention, you've been successful.

7702~~~
Agreed.
But also I will add that, the video makes it look like he is scoring many goals. Every goal in that video is shown repeatedly, through different angles to make it look like he is scoring many/different goals, when they are in fact the same goal.
I believe he only scored 4 goals, for all the time he has been on the pitch, but most importantly, he has regressed. And this regression is the issue.
If he were improving week by week, then I dont think anybody would have an issue. We would all be saying that this time next year he will be a goal machine.
The issue is that he is getting worse with every game and while he is on the pitch, it looks like we have no chance of scoring.

I will also add that he is struggling to score against lower division teams. Theoretically, against (tougher) PL or CL teams, it will be even tougher, to score.

7703~~~
I'm stunned by the kind of response I received from my post. Are we supporting a club or a player here?

7704~~~
I'd say that most of us here are supporting the idea that you need help if you were for real with your post.

7705~~~
This thread is starting to sound like the Rooney thread from last year, you know that player who everyone now wants to play up front<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

7706~~~
Is Successful all right?

7707~~~
I think he's fine as long as everyone knows their station in life and dresses appropriately.

7708~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's stealthily emerged as one of the weirdest posters on here.

7709~~~
It's become a moot point. He's on loan, he won't stay and although it might do his future some good to turn things around before the end of the season, it's understandable that his heart will no longer be in it.

7710~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7711~~~
Surely we're primarily supporting premium brands such as Prada?  Football clubs and players are of pretty little importance compared to premium brands.

7712~~~
Probably clutching at straws, but the same thought occurred to me.  Late pregnancy can be a pretty stressful time.  

Problem is, even if this is the case, having a newborn baby around is not a recipe for getting back to a normal, relaxed routine.  By my reckoning he should be back to his old self in about 20 years.

7713~~~
I had this image of Successful posting that rant with a shotgun in one hand and a 3/4 empty bottle of whiskey(single malt?) in the other hand.

7714~~~
Both RVP and Falcao are simply too slow, that's only going to get worse.

7715~~~
Prada bag must've been somewhere there.

7716~~~
Isn't Successful the same guy who came up with that ridiculous "transfer kitty" diagram? I hope someone remembers.

7717~~~

7719~~~
Falcao already has a kid, I believe this would be his second. Nevertheless, that doesn't make pregnancy any easier so that's a plausible explanation for his poor form, as someone else already pointed out.

7720~~~
I enjoyed the subtly of Successful's post.

7721~~~
Just to be clear, Falcao is a man and therefore won't actually be carrying the baby inside in.

7722~~~

Monaco's vice chairman speaks out - 

<b><i>"We have interest from other great clubs..."</i></b>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31548955" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31548955</a>

7726~~~
Looks like we made it clear to them that we won't be paying up.. Monaco either trying to bully us into paying the full fee or drum up some interest..

7727~~~
Thanks. I did chuckle myself when I wrote it. I willl be back at Xmas to pick up post of the year... :-)

7728~~~
Monaco are and should be very worried by the way this loan is working out. United won't pay 40m and I doubt they would get 20m for him in the summer. Not on those wages anyhow.

7729~~~
Ok, this is good news. No hidden obligatory buy.

7730~~~
Agreed with this. I have this feeling that he is going to come good for the last 6-8 games and make the decision even more difficult

7731~~~
Is there anything stopping us from just making a regular bid for the guy if we want him? I can't see it anyway.

7732~~~
Is that suppose to be a threat? Please let me know what clubs are interested and we'll send him over right away. LIAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

7733~~~
The problem is a reasonable offer for him would be seen as insulting, you're looking at probably only just over a third of the agreed price.

7734~~~
Feck me. Had no idea we were paying him over a million a month in wages. Staggering.

7735~~~
Well he is excellent in the box, in a team that struggles to create chances then he will play like he has but in a team that creates then he is dangerous.

Personally I would play one up top and have him as a super sub, if we are attacking for the win then he could be dangerous coming off the bench.

I also think we likely will start creating chances consistently before the season is out so he could come good.

7736~~~
I doubt there is much interest in him, they could barely get rid of him in the last day of the transfer window last season. Now he is one year older and his reputation is pretty much thrashed after the season he's having.

7737~~~
The stink of desperation in his comments is pretty funny, tbf. All a bit Brent drunkenly ranting on his hotel bed.

7738~~~
I have this funny feeling that today Falcao will make his mark. In a good way.

7739~~~
My thoughts also.

7740~~~
I have a feeling he'll touch the ball a total of 9 times losing it each time through terrible control then do nothing else at all before being subbed at 70 minute mark and we will immediately improve in our play.

7741~~~
i had a friend who kept saying  "arsenal look like winning the league this year" i think he stopped saying maybe three years ago. i guess if you keep saying it one day it will happen. maybe next season at inter or ac , hell could even be today , that a blind squirrel finding a nut theory comes true.

7742~~~
Dropped and rightly so, hope he comes on for RvP late in the match and has a positive reaction.

7743~~~
On the bench, very much deserved.

7744~~~
"This is gonna cost ya, this is gonna cost ya...".

7745~~~
Yep, RvP has shown why he should be benched for sure.

7746~~~
Earned £265000 by sitting on the bench this week. Should be totally ashamed of himself. Give your money to the starving people in the world. You're not worht it you snake. Have him cut the grass at Old Trafford tomorrow or something. Have him run around the stadium or anything to justify his wage.

7747~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7748~~~
Not only that but the deal that was agreed was 6mill for the loan and 44m for to complete the deal, meaning Monaco ( who are desperate to sell) would have made a slight profit for a striker 2 years older and with a cruciate injury under his belt.

Woodward was taken to the cleaners in those negotiations

7749~~~
Incredible. How do we get drawn into these awful deals in the same window that Costa went to Chelsea for 30m and Sanchez to Arsenal for 35m?

Sanchez is being paid 100 grand a week less than we're paying Falcao right now...

If we'd gone to the Sanchez deal and offered 40m and higher wages he obviously would be a United player right now. Disgraceful really.

But then I started a thread on our transfer strategies - <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/why-is-our-transfer-approach-so-abject-and-shockingly-poor.401457/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/why-is-our-transfer-approach-so-abject-and-shockingly-poor.401457/</a> - and it seemed most were happy with our dealings over the last 5 years.

For me there's been a real lack of logic in our transfers for almost 10 years - the fact that we even manage to get roundly fleeced in a fecking<i> loan deal</i> really takes the cake though!

7751~~~
He'll take dump in the Swansea team bath perhaps.

7752~~~
I know he has been poor so far, but I was still surprised he didn't come off the bench yesterday. The amount of times the ball was dropping free in the box, it was crying out for a poacher to be on the end of things.

When he has played we seem to have very little service. When he isn't playing the ball seems to be landing in the six yard box with nobody on the end of it. Not making excuses for him - has been well below expectations - but yesterday was a missed opportunity. Had he come on and salvaged a point, what might that have done for his confidence?

7753~~~
It's funny cause clubs actually have a choice about what they want to pay players. They can say no!!!!!! I'm not sure what people expected. Without being medical experts, we've seen enough of these injuries to know the rehab time is bloody long. He arrived her not fit, yet alone match fit. Even when fit, there were setbacks with other injuries. They he couldn't get match fit cause wasn't having a run of games.....

All this aside, he still might not have been good enough, transfers are a gamble. 

......and it's not like he's joinning the 2008 utd team!!!! Di Maria arrived fit, great last season with Real, good World Cup, we paid 62m for him, and even he's struggling.

7754~~~
I know there are posters who don't care about fees/wages etc, but for a player who has contributed so little to the club to be earning that makes me want to cry. Considering how it would take me over ten years to earn that and I'm actually good at my job proves there is no god

7755~~~
Doesn't really matter whether he gets service or not. He would have missed anyway.

As far as I'm concerned I'd rather stick Fellaini up top than play Falcao.

7756~~~
We would actually be better off playing without forwards than with rvp or falcao at the moment, they slow everything down so much

7757~~~
I read some where that Falcao does a lot of charity work and helps out a lot of people back in Colombia.

7758~~~
Come on, who doesn't? It's part of their job today as footballers. I'm not impressed.

7760~~~
I am in no way justifying his wage or anything but to people actually believe he gets the full reported figure every week if he doesn't play?

The figures we here are what a player could earn. Again, I'm sure he took home a ridiculous amount of money this week but I think people have to get some of the figures out of their head.

Why do you think so many players get the shits when they are on the bench or don't play...it's because they don't get paid as much.

7761~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7762~~~
Monaco's #9 is better then our #9, and we signed ours from Monaco, while they signed theirs from us.

Thats fecking depressing.

7763~~~
They signed him from Fulham.

7764~~~
I completely forgot he signed for Fulham <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

That was weird.

7765~~~
I think RvP being out will help him. RvP is probably the worst potential partner for him at the club. 

Regardless I would rather his minutes were given to Adnan/Mata/Wilson

7766~~~
Lets buy Berbatov back from Monaco for £60m and play him and RvP up top together, Falcao can slot in behind them as a number 10 with Rooney in CM partnered by ADM.

Get Shevchenko out of retirement and play him and Fellaini on the wings.

Shove whoever's fit into the back 4. Sell DDG for peanuts to Real Madrid and play our manager's old mate Valdes in goal.

Didn't you know that waffling absolute bollocks and then saying "Philosophy" is funny?

7769~~~
It's just hit me that Welbeck's fee won't even cover Falcao's loan and wages for the year.

7770~~~
You create some very odd posts.

7771~~~
That's right, Pexbo. Talking about football on the internet is a <i>serious business</i>.

Unless one of your cyber buddies cracks a joke, then the green smilies flow, but if it's some other Man Utd fan on the same Man Utd forum as you, then NO, the arms stay folded and the <i>serious business</i> of talking about football mustn't be breached.

It's odd world, my friend, an odd world. Made all the more surreal by this seasons 'Philosophy'.

You'd think we were pish in the last decade the way you speak Jupiter try supporting any the other clubs in England who have had much less success in this decade.

7774~~~
Why would critiquing the exec side of the club that I love mean that I should "try supporting any the other clubs in England who have had much less success in this decade"?

I've supported United since I was about 6 (1986), and I remember all those years well, mate. I'm free to respectfully critique what I feel could be better about the club, and any opinion that I feel or type I'll explain to you if you don't agree with it or understand what I'm saying. Maybe you can offer me your take on my thoughts and give me something to muse upon. But the whole, 'go and support someone else' nonsense is silly, mate.

For almost 10 years there has been a real lack of logic our transfer dealings.

There's been a continual refusal to deal with crucial parts of our squad, this is costing us <i>right now</i>.

Top, top talent we've missed out on because Fergie begrudged paying agents what they were asking for, yet, at the same time we'd get drawn into dodgy, agent appeasing dealings like the embarrassing Bebé transfer that cost us more than the 6m Hazard's agent wanted, so he goes to a direct rival, and they're sat at the top of the league right now.

We failed to properly and immediately reinvest the Ronaldo money and sacrificed the quality of our football by signing mid-table players. Again, this is costing us <i>right now</i>.

This football we're watching is actually dire for Manchester United and it has been for ages, since before Fergie retired in fact.

So you've got 3 managers, all very different, all churning out boring, below par (for Utd) football, while the same issues in the team continue to be ignored in the transfer windows that've gone by. And that, my man, is why I critique our transfer dealings quite heavily.

It's not how much we're spending, it's <i>what we're spending it on</i>.

7775~~~

Feck me Jupiter your fired up this morning! I've long supported United as well and for the record I wasn't implying you to go support someone new, I was meaning try supporting our rivals as the last 10 years success wise for Arsenal Liverpool City Chelsea have been sparse in comparison to Unitedin various degrees. We have been well and truely spoiled and now we are suffering because we are adapting to new managers. I'm not overly happy with what is happening right now but it takes time so that's what we need to do with LVG. We had a disastrous season after Fergie left and Moyes took the brunt (players needed to look at themselves imho) no way should we slipped to 7th from 1st. The club tried to redress that in January breaking our transfer record then in the summer splashed the cash big time again (recruiting good players from what I see) All but Falcao look like they will be successful here. This summer I'd like us to condense the approach to maybe 3 players and keep them quality we are not far off Chelsea City but a million miles of Barca Madrid and Bayern.

Funny, I nearly fell of my chair laughing.

7777~~~
Yep, that's a good post. 

The entire "value for money" strategy adopted by SAF has a huge impact today still.

SAF was a genius who had the formula, know how and experience to win the EPL with his eyes closed, but that relative poor transfer windows from 2009/2010 onwards is costing us.

7778~~~
Oh sorry man I didn't mean to offend. It was actually a really funny joke and deserved more green smilies if I'm honest. Try using it a few more times before it gets old.

7779~~~
Its hard to find fault with this post.... you make some solid points.
I have stated after SAF left that we needed a DOF and that still stands today.

7780~~~
I agree with a big part of your analysis, and we can all say that in terms of transfer, the club has been quite poor during Fergie’s last years, avoiding to fix the issue where it was the most needed. But we had Fergie as our main star, and the fact is that this guy was enough to win a League with Cleverley and Welbeck as regular starter.

I mean that it’s true that we should have sign a top midfielder since Keano left, and one other even before Scholesy left. I can remember than we try once to get Michael Essien from Lyon, and Mahamadou Diarra (left for Madrid) the year after, the eternal Sneijder, Hazard, Modric, Benzema, Robben… He missed a lot of players, but he get a lot also. Whether he didn’t wanted to overpay them is true but he was wrong, and in this manner he was alright because he managed to get a very strong team anyway.

I agree with you in the sense that the transfer policy didn’t helped the after Fergie, but you can say that this year, we added some very talented footballers in the middle in Blind, Herrera, Di Maria and Mata….

Two years ago we played with Valencia Anderson Cleverley and Young. So I think that the transfer policy is changing and we’re trying to overcome our deficit slowly.

We failed to replace Ronaldo its true; we failed to replace Rio, Vidic, Evra, Scholesy, Giggsy… But I just want us to take time to rebuild and have new leaders now. I really hope that Ronaldo can be replaced by someone like Reus or Bale next year, Rio and Vidic by great defenders, Di Maria and Mata are top talent, just like Herrera.  

As long as we’ll find a true balance in the team, and get rid of the bad players, I’m sure that in terms of quality we’ll reach the likes of Chelsea

7781~~~
Lost every battle so far, where does the illusion come from that he's strong?

7782~~~
I think I could tackle him.

7783~~~
He certainly used to be. feck knows what's going on with him. Pathetic so far today.

7784~~~
Maybe before United but he's been bullied all season, especially by the lower clubs.

7785~~~
Yes of course before United. He was a beast at Porto and Atletico; never watched him at Monaco. He's a shadow of that player. We need to sever our ties with him this summer.

7786~~~
Has he had a single touch today?

7787~~~
Young just delivered the sort of ball the Falcao I knew would try to reach for and very possibly score yet he was nowhere near it. He was always one step ahead of defenders and even his "assisters". Poor movement, he's at an incredible low, I truly hope he comes back to near his best one day.

7788~~~
An overreaction singling him out. Rooney hasn't been better. Rooney's form has been poor for a while.

7789~~~
Has done nothing today. Literally nothing. Absolutely woeful. We've even had some decent possession.

7790~~~
Him and Rooney have been crap but then that's no surprise.

7791~~~
First thing I thought "where the feck was Falcao?" His job in this moment was simply to "be there" - still too much.

7792~~~
He looks like a conference player, Brown dispossess him way too fecking easily

7793~~~
Get Fellaini on, he's a bigger goal threat than this has-been,

7794~~~
Rather play Mata or Fellaini than him. Does nothing.

7795~~~
Falcao has had all the service you could ever want and he just stands there.  Not sure why he is playing.  Awful.  Take him off.  Play Rooney as sole striker with Mata in behind.  FFS>

7796~~~
Trash

7797~~~
Surely he's not being singled out? This is the Falcao thread and people are rightly pointing out that he has been awful. I'm sure the likes of Rooney and Di Maria wil get the same treatment.

7798~~~
He's just not showing any signs of improvement.

7799~~~
Do Opta do % of time spent on arse?

7800~~~
Just can't see the benefit of playing him today. Real slap in the face for Mata..

7801~~~
A 35 year old Wes Brown has made him his bitch!

7802~~~
Oh he will be on for some nice hoof ball. Give it until around the 60/70 minute mark.

7803~~~
His thread has been updated. Rooney's hasn't. It's also a clear difference between the two in the match day thread.

7804~~~
Maybe we should bring him on at half time.....

7805~~~
He's atrocious. And that's not an exaggeration.

7806~~~
I don't know why he drops deep to look for the ball when he can't do sweet fanny all with it anyways. He should be in the box waiting for half a chance. He really should have been on the end of Young's low drive across goal (not the one that hit the crossbar off o'Shea), his positioning is just odd.

7807~~~
I wouldn't pay that much attention to the match day thread, to be fair. Di Maria's thread is also bumped. Falcao has been dire but yeah he's certainly not the only one.

7808~~~
Waste of space along with his pal Roo, never look like scoring a goal.

7809~~~
He's one of two strikers. The other striker hasn't been better at all. Same last game and the games before.

7810~~~
Wes Brown has Falcao in his pocket. That's a phrase I never thought I'd write :/

7811~~~
I can just about deal with his inability to receive the ball to feet so long as he's a threat in the box. He's been anonymous whenever we've got around there so I have to ask, what is the point in him being on the pitch?

7812~~~
Yes Rooney has also been wank, doesn't take away from the fact that Falcao has been just as bad.

7813~~~
Which is basically what I'm saying but the other way around. Rooney has been as bad yet Rooney is the one that knows the league, club and he's been playing all season without being injured. What's his excuse? Was very good to begin with but hasn't shown good form since Christmas. That worries be a lot more than Falcao who's a loanee.

7814~~~
Why don't you bump the Rooney thread then ?

7815~~~
Rooney gets lots of stick when he's shite. I should know because I'm in his thread having a go at him almost every week.

Still, Falcao has been considerably worse than Rooney so far.

7816~~~
I don't bump threads much to shit over our players.

7817~~~
I guess people are just used to Rooney's spells of playing like a 50 year old Dean Windass. I would imagine people - certainly me anyway - expected so much more from Falcao.

7818~~~
Falcao simply looks lost atm. He seems to be in the wrong spot all the time.

7819~~~
Fair enough.

7820~~~
It's painful to watch him play. Nothing is working for him and he should be nowhere near the first eleven.

7821~~~
Today was his last chance IMO to show if he's any good. Finally playing as the main striker, in the middle, with wingers... Yet he's look every bit as bad as he has all season. Weak on the ball, slow, no movement, just offers nothing.

7822~~~
Why would you shit over him ? There could be hundreds other reasons to bump it (to encourage him for instance).

7823~~~
I admire van Gaal's patience over Falcao.

7824~~~
What's worse then him being overpowered is he's not even taking up the right positions in the box. Where are his instincts gone?

7825~~~
Hasn't shown anything at all so far. He has been largely invisible out there. He needs to seriously start impacting games, otherwise I'd just play Wilson over him, or simply push Rooney right up top again. Either way he is running out of time to convince LVG to purchase him full time.

7826~~~
Not as bad as Swansea; he has actually kept possession neatly on a few occasions (straws well and truly clutched). But nowhere near good enough. Should have had a penalty though.

7827~~~
Wes Brown who's 35 and was at his peak probably 7 years ago has dominated him so far.

7828~~~
Playing like a bag of puppies that has no clues. To think that he costs us about a million a month.

7829~~~
What a saying.

7830~~~
These threads are bumped after 20 minutes. The game is still on. United haven't played well for 90 minutes once this season. I don't see the need for it. Match day threads are for venting. Bump the threads after the game when you've got the whole picture.

7831~~~
Like I said a thread can be bumped for any number of reasons during or after the match.

7832~~~
What Falcao did there was close to vintage Falcao. Sharp and good touches in the box. Wouldve been a great goal if he wasn't fouled. 

Shame that now there should be more spaces, he gets subbed.

7833~~~
Excellent play to win that penalty. Shame Van Gaal stuck with the sub.

7834~~~
Great management.

7835~~~
Finally he shows a great touch and wins a penalty, a glimpse of his old class. Sunderland down to 10 men at Old Trafford. Brown, his tormentor all day, sent off. This could be the confidence boost he needs. nope. TAKE HIM OFF STRAIGHTAWAY

7836~~~
Was having another awful game until winning the penalty, strange he was taken off after that though given the fact Sunderland were down to ten men.

7837~~~
I think he was  already coming off, he was absolutely woeful today.

7838~~~
Taking Falcao off when he did is nightmarish man management from LvG. I mean, Falcao's been shit for the entire year, but if a moment was going to give him the confidence to kick on, that was it. At least give him another ten minutes, especially since Sunderland were down to ten and we scored the penalty.

Shocking stuff from LvG.

7839~~~
Had a shocker until that penalty, please he managed to get something right though.

7840~~~
LVG's man management isn't the best is it? Openly criticizing players the way he does is something you never saw Fergie do. Falcao's touch there was, to use a ruined phrase, world class.

7841~~~
Yea that sub was ready prior to him winning penalty. Good job done for the penalty, awful other than that.

7842~~~
I'd say the penalty incident is a sign of improvement at least.

7843~~~
Did feck all until that penalty decision, good footwork there.

7844~~~
It's not quite the same but earlier in the season RVP was in shocking form and bagged that great goal against Hull right before he was about to be subbed and got some confident from that, hopefully Falcao get's some confidence from that piece of play for the penalty as it was the defining moment of the game and class.

7845~~~
Completely agree, horrible management.

7846~~~
That touch <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I know you'll know the one I'm referring to, because I doubt you can remember more than 1.

7847~~~
That sub makes me pretty convinced he's not staying. Promising news.

7848~~~
He's absolutely woeful. I don't think I can remember such a bad striker playing for United in years.

7849~~~
Maybe LVG just ordered the change before the touch and the pen. Do we know anything about subs work for pros ? I mean like if the coaching staff validates x player to replace y, can it still be changed at the last min or once it's done nothing can change anymore ?

7850~~~
Super play to win penalty. I thought he played ok just wasn't involved much as Di Maria was having a shocking game.

7851~~~
Pretty baffling to hook him off 2 minutes after he actually does something to boost his confidence. I mean nobody is denying he wasn't good today up until that point, but 30 minutes against 10 men was a chance for him to build on it.

7852~~~
Very happy for him to have an important contribution in the game eventually. Obviously doesn't change much and he was still poor all around but nice for him to at least have that moment with a good bit of skill to win the penalty.

7853~~~
You can change it. Should have kept him on.

7854~~~
You often see a player standing on the touchline in his kit just waiting for the next break in play so he can come on, but when that break in play comes it happens to be because of an injury. In those situation the manager hurriedly changes his mind and sends a replacement for the injured player on instead; he doesn't get forced into making his original subsitution because it's been "validated", even though everything is set up for it to occur prior to the injury and the change of mind.

7855~~~
If it can be changed then really that was a very harsh from LVG.

Cheers. I completely forgot that it could be done. As a result, I can only agree with your previous post.

7856~~~
Fellaini did a much better job at holding up the ball than Falcao was doing so subbing him off was still the right thing to do. 

Excellent touch to win the penalty, but Christ, he really is abject. I wouldn't pursue this exercise anymore. I'd sooner see Fellaini or Mata in the side with Rooney playing the lone frontman.

7857~~~
Subbing him off was awful, as they went a man down. He'd have thrived after that IMO. That touch was absolute class

7858~~~
Great bit of play to win the penalty, but I think that was the only good thing he did in the game, unfortunately.

7859~~~
He was playing against a tired 10 men when we were winning, you can't compare the two situations.

7860~~~
I have been very disappointed in him, but I have to say today wasn't his fault. He started playing well when we did only to be subbed for Fellaini.

7861~~~
True, but I don't think that excuses Falcao's generally inability to control the ball or get into the right positions to score.

7862~~~
Agreed. Poor management from LVG to take him off after that. We didn't change our game plan after Fellaini came on, I would've kept Falcao on. One goal could have changed things for him.

 Still, he shouldn't be starting games for the sake of it.

7863~~~
That is exactly what he did for the penalty though.

7864~~~
He must have been so excited to see Wes Brown sent off wrongly considering how firmly he was tucked into Wes' pocket all match

7865~~~
His touches for the penalty were superb. It's annoying he didn't get the chance to smash it at goal. He really needs a goal. Harsh that he had to come off, but it looked like the sub was already decided long before he won the penalty. Decent hold up play at times, but we didn't really create much when he was on the pitch. We look better with one striker and a 5 man midfield.

7866~~~
Deserved to be subbed.

7867~~~
Lovely piece of skill that. Van Gaal should have kept him on seeing as though Brown was no longer on the pitch.

7868~~~
For the first time in what feels like months and we scored from it. The ball pinged off him in similar positions about 4 times before that one finally stuck.

7869~~~
The way he won that penalty was the best thing he's done in the Manchester United shirt, other than that he was pretty ineffective. He works hard, but he's incredibly weak. Don't think the system suits him at all, he's not even getting goal scoring opportunities.

7870~~~
we probably won't keep him....and sods law this will be his rehabilitation season....goes off somewhere else and absolutely storms it.

7871~~~
Was pretty shite. Good play to win the pen, though any confidence he will have gotten from that will be gone after being subbed off right away. No chance is he staying here next season.

7872~~~
Good control of the ball when he was fouled for the penalty. A lot of effort but very little end product from him again though.

7873~~~
And once is acceptable for a mooted £43 million purchase? It was a good piece of play but it hardly compensates for his wider inability to get the basics right.

7874~~~
Yeah it was a lovely touch and manoeuvre. Obviously Brown was hard done by but I though O'Shea would have been too had he gone off. I swear on my crappy stream it actually looked like Falcao rolled his ankle standing on a pink bottle?!

7875~~~
Foul maybe did him a favour with way he has been playing he may well not have scored and would have been subbed off anyway so at least he made some sort of contribution in the end after what was another very abject performance. He should be dropped for next game though we can't carry him away from home, should switch to the five man midfield with Rooney up top, use falcao off the bench.

7876~~~
Anonymous really until the penalty.

7877~~~
Didnt he do a similar thing in the game away vs Leicester early on ? He has had  a couple of turns and  the odd bit of good play since joining, but they might have got clouded in the way of the last 10 or so games and 99.5% of his gametime otherwise.

7878~~~
I'm just relieved that O'shea fouled him tbh, because lets be honest, he would inevitably have missed the chance after the good touch.

7879~~~
Was on course for one of the most abject performances I've ever seen from a United striker inside Old Trafford (his runs today were a particular highlight of awfulness... he spent most of the time hiding behind Sunderland players or just not showing for the ball at all)... then he did one good thing in behind, then one very good thing and got a penalty... then was substituted.

And everyone fecking boo'd... Old Trafford is a weird place these days.

7880~~~
If fans want him to stay on the team because of 1 brilliant turn in yet another terrible game then i don't know anymore man...

7881~~~
When he leaves this summer, winning that penalty will be the best moment of his youtube highlights reel. 

Come to think of it, I can think of all of the few moments that'll make up that video - his four goals, hitting the bar and setting up Van Persie against Leicester away, and winning this penalty.

7882~~~
He really was so so bad. He barely even resembled a footballer 90% of the time.

7883~~~
Hang on - wasn't Falcao playing when we played against Villa (10 men)?
I think so (correct me if I am wrong), but he and RVP didnt thrive at all against Villa.
I realise that some fans love Falcao, but we need to think about whats best for the team and winning games and not just giving below-par players time on the pitch.

Man Utd is a giant club and as a player, if you are playing badly, you can't expect to get game time (unless you are RVP, of course). Falcao will understand this...though may be very frustrated.

7884~~~
Course he would.

7885~~~
The sentimentality on here is killing me. He had another shocker, one good touch and he should be staying on? It is about winning, not pleasing underperforming players.

7886~~~
Won the penalty with a quality bit of play but otherwise he was poor yet again.

7887~~~
Awesome play for the pen, should've been allowed to build his confidence after that.

7888~~~
Won the penalty, but offered so little generally.  Another player destroyed by an awful injury.  Let's face it, it can't be confidence, if it was confidence he would have produced much more in all these games LVG has shown faith in him.  Mendes trying his best to convince LVG to sign him but imo he's finished at this level.  It would take a superhuman change in form to warranty the transfer fee set by Monaco.

7889~~~
Its mostly psychological with him. Hes not a player who drops deep to hunt for the ball, but thats what he is doing, mostly out of frustration i think. He is at his best off the defenders' shoulders and in the box, latching on to chances we should be creating. The first time we actually get him half a chance and he wins a penalty and would have scored.

I cant say its his fault its not working at this club but its getting too late to justify the transfer.

7890~~~
He was shite today, apart from the move where he won the penalty - that was top class.

7891~~~
I know I'm clutching at straws here, but I was really hoping he'd stay on after the first goal/sending off when Sunderland's defence would get more stretched. Barely got involved in the first half but aside from winning the penalty he had another excellent piece of approach play not long before.

7892~~~
First half he was awful. Second half was much better. I watched him closely today, I felt frustrated for him. He makes some great runs but never gets the ball, we insist on passing it back or sideways. 

I really didn't get LVG's logic to sub him after the penalty though. Just didn't make any sense.

7893~~~
Complete waster, I swear to god if we sign him or have a deal in place to sign him I'm hunting down ed woodward.

7894~~~
I'm sure he's shitting himself at the thought.

7895~~~
I think he's worse at protecting the ball and holding it up than Hernandez. If we want to sign him, we might as well keep Hernandez at the club. Least he's younger and faster

He gets far too much stick, whereas other ineffective players get little criticism.

I watch him closely too, see the runs ...etc. You would think that he gets 10 or 20 chances a game and misses them, to get that level of criticism. The service is complete bollocks, yet he is the only one that instinctively chases in on shots from outside the box, or moves to the 6 yard line for crosses.

7897~~~
Nah.....he's playing in a fantastic team, playing great football with bags of creativity and with wingers and players that have been creating loads of chances for him. If only he was like the other forwards at the club who were scoring loads of goals!!

7898~~~
LvG picked him out for praise in the post match interview, for the penalty thing.

7899~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if he went from being subbed off for being ineffective to being saved for Wednesday now RVP is injured because of that one bit of class. I think Fellaini was ready when the penalty was awarded but we waited for it to go in before he came on.

7900~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7901~~~
The service isn't good but the he had one moment of quality and it led to goal, if he did that more often rather than constantly being pushed off the ball or mis controlling the ball he wouldn't be such a waste of space. That moment showed that if you are good enough you can make something out of nothing or very little.

He gets criticised because he is playing really badly, the service and performance of others are valid points but he just isn't and hasn't been good enough for someone who would cost and earns a fortune.

7902~~~
I still like him, maybe it's because of what he is capable off.

7903~~~
The problem is, while his performances aren't horrible, it's not good enough to sign him, especially with the risk of his damaged knee attached to it.

7904~~~
No need to sugarcoat it, he's fecking shite.

7905~~~
Can he do more than Hernandez?
That's the big question.

And based off today, rather than the past

7906~~~
He can, he's just not doing it.

7907~~~
Has anyone got any post-match quotes from Van Gaal on Falcao?

7908~~~

7909~~~
Course he would.

7910~~~
Agree. I just think to put him down when the other players are just playing side to side is too much. 

As an example, I thought Rooney was rubbish today, yet got 2 goals, and so gets no criticism. The second goal was a typical example of an opportunist goal where the striker is in an ideal position. Falcao is in the positions nearly every attack, yet the ball is not be put in to that space. That doesn't mean I think he is exceptional, just I think the criticism is unfair.

7911~~~
He would, that's why Sam said it.

7912~~~
I only heard one comment, he said "Falcao played well for the penalty." 

He did say just before that, when the interviewer was asking about specific players, that he does not like talking about individuals. He mentioned that certain players have gained a bit of confidence based on today's performance. Young did well. He said Adnan had been given chances before, but today he got an assist so it will do good for his confidence. Reading between the lines, Adnan has not performed too well before in his eyes, which is reflect by many comments on here.

7913~~~
Okay. Does he have next weeks lotto numbers by any chance? Could do with a win.

7914~~~
I just don't think he deals very well with how little time he has in the Premier League. When he receives the ball he's hassled, when he's getting a chance on goal he's hassled, and it's something he isn't used to. When he's had quite a long injury lay off last season this probably wasn't the challenge he needed to get back to form.

7915~~~
Poor again for the most part. However, I do think he should've been kept on. At the the end of the day LvG is going to use 2 strikers and it's best we try to get him going somehow because we're going to actually need him for the time being.

7916~~~
He is having the Torres syndrome, he is the same player, he has the same qualities but he totally lost his confidence.

7917~~~
From what we've seen of his finishing so far, I think there's a very good chance he would have done, yes. He snatches at everything.

7918~~~
Kinda like the what if Carragher hadn't blocked Torres's shot from going in on his debut, against Liverpool of all teams, what if Green hadn't saved Falcao's shot from the rebound on debut. 

He started off energetic and lively who just needed a run of games and he'll be set but as the season has gone on he's looking like a ghost out there.

7919~~~
I'd expect Shola Ameobi to finish on his favoured foot in the 6 yard box. 

What you said initially was another example, in a long line of negativity, towards Falcao from you. Clearly you're not a fan and obviously we're all entitled to our opinions. You just seem to look forward to Falcao making mistakes so you can come in here and take the pi$$. 

Forget everything else, any player putting on our shirt and giving everything he has for our club has my support. 
He looks a shadow of himself and it doesn't look good and I don't think we'll sign him. 
But any chance of him reaching the level he was at before will be celebrated by me. Even if that's not at this club. As long as it isn't a direct rival of course. He was one of my favourite strikers to watch at Atletico and Porto.

7920~~~
Hope he makes the most of RvP's absence. For his sake and ours.

7921~~~
Sorry, but I spent a lot of the first half watching him... And his movement is either gash or completely non existence.

7922~~~
Every striker who isn't scoring gets the phrase "his movement is great" or "he's holding the ball up well". I've heard it so often for Welbeck, Hernandez, Macheda from United, Welbeck at Arsenal, Torres, Soldado, Anelka so and so forth. 

It's the go-to line to have some optimism. And it's rubbish.

7923~~~
I've been negative towards Falcao because he's been rubbish. 

I'd love nothing more for him to get his Athletico form back too, but its just not going to happen. You only have to watch him to see that (for whatever reasons) he's past it.

7924~~~
Still rather seeing that over what RVP gives us.

7925~~~
Winning of the penalty was his first bit of world class play for a while.

7926~~~
Why other than the pen he did nothing good, at least Rvp has decent hold up play.

7927~~~
Shearer was spot on with his analysis on MOTD. He just doesn't (or can't imo) run in behind defenders. That in itself has ruined his whole game. He's just not a striker that can play with his back to goal.

7928~~~
FFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

7929~~~
For once I think Shearer got it right. Falcao's game isn't holding the ball up and linking play, it's scoring goals. Either he isn't making the right runs, or when he does he isn't being played in, or a mixture of both.

7930~~~
Never really showed why he deserves to be in the starting 11. If fit I think Wilson should play on Wednesday.

7931~~~
There is no doubt that his confidence is totally shot. He is playing terribly but anyone who has seen him play knows how good he can be. He won the game for United today. If he'd scored that 5 yard header Rooney got it could have done wonders for his confidence.

The benefits a firing Falcao could add to United for the rest of the season far outweigh anything Fellaini was ever going to contribute for the rest of that game. A really terrible substitution.

7932~~~
His movement was not good today. It made miss Hernandez.

7933~~~
In any game with space in behind, it's a question of (1) Wilson vs (2) Mata (Rooney higher up) vs (3) Januzaj out right and Di Maria as the 10, for me. Falcao 4th choice, fighting with Fellaini who at least can do what guys like Pelle and Streller do for their clubs being massive and holding up play well.

7934~~~
Many players have been 'rubbish' for us. You're extremely vocal in your dislike only for Falcao it seems.

7935~~~
At least Falcao puts in. I like RVP but I have to be honest, he just doesn't put in enough and regardless of quality, end product or whatever, that's something I can't accept.

7936~~~
You might want to check some other threads if thats what you think. Especially the Jones, Evans and RVP ones from this season, and certainly the Rooney ones from the last couple of years.

If a player is playing badly, I'll call it. The fact Falcao has played badly in pretty much every game isn't my fault. You'll also know (if you have a look through) I've been quick to praise his, relatively few, good performances this season. I have no dislike for the player, I just think he's a bit rubbish.

7937~~~
I'll admit I've missed you praising any of his decent performances. It doesn't help that they are few. 
Just seems very noticeable how vocal you are when he hasn't played so well.

7938~~~
Would you take Falcao for £25m and a 50% pay cut in his wages?

7939~~~
I'd keep Chicharito instead.

7940~~~
No chance. I'd want my wages doubled at the very least to keep him.

7941~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> i walked right into that one

7943~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.

As for Falcao's performance, it was poor. Aside from winning the penalty (which he did well for) he was non-existent really. Kind of glad he got applause when he left the field though. Maybe it will raise his confidence. He gives us nothing though. There is no reason to play him.

7944~~~
One positive thing about Falcao is his attitude. He clearly wants to do well here. He's trying his best to get out of this rut. He could have collapsed to the floor a few times during the penalty incident, but he stayed on his feet because he wanted to score. Him going down would mean a Rooney penalty. 

I really want him to do well here.

7945~~~
Shearer hit the nail on the head on MOTD yesterday. He's simply making all the wrong runs and coming deep to receive the ball far too often - and it seems that no one has picked him up on it.

7946~~~
I would rather play Angelo Henriquez.

7947~~~
I'm in the minority here, but I think Falcao did alright yesterday and should have stayed on the pitch. Did extremely well to control that cross when he won the penalty.

It's also frustrating that he's rarely on the pitch near the end of games. That's when opposing defences open up and there are more chances however he's usually taken off with half an hour remaining. I couldn't understand why he was taken off for Fellaini when Sunderland went down to 10 men.

Again, I'm in the minority, but I also disagree with Shearer's analysis on MOTD. During the match there were times when I was just watching Falcao to see if he was doing anything worthwhile off the ball. And, honestly, I thought his movement was very good at times. He was frequently losing defenders and moving into space, however the problem is that the ball never comes. We spend so much time passing it side-to-side that attackers running into space aren't able to get involved. There was a chance near the end of the first half when he was running clean through but Di Maria got the pass all wrong. As a result, him and the other forwarders are dropping deep to try and get involved.

It might even be fair to say that our strikers aren't the problem. Rooney, Falcao and Van Persie are all world class, and they'd break into any top European side and contribute goals. The fact that all three are being made to look decidedly average surely points to our approach play?

Cutting a long story short, I think Falcao did alright yesterday and I hope him and Rooney get a good run together up front.

7948~~~
There was a few times in the first half he had decent movement but the ball never came. I honestly believe that's the route of our problem up front. LVG spoke about not having a 20 goal striker this season... Well we do, we have 3 of them. We haven't used them properly and the cautious passing style hasn't helped.

7949~~~
Falcao/Rooney/RvP could be making dangerous runs in and around the box all day long, our philosophy is such that is doesn't allow for the ball to be played into them due to the risk of losing the ball.

When was the last time any of the three were able to run on to the ball, instead of with their back to goal?

7950~~~
Yep. He shouldn't be playing with his back to the goal, he should be fishing around the opposition's back four, ready to make a run or link up play.

7951~~~
Those talks should take all of 20 secs: "You've been shit. Piss off back to Monaco, there's a good lad."

7952~~~
He wants a permanent contract from a club stupid enough to pay his massive wages, whether that's us or someone else. That's what he's playing for.

He might 'have a nice smile' or whatever, but he's a mercenary. His and Mendes' approach over the last 3 seasons show this clearly.

7953~~~
In that analysis it was really odd he kept coming short with back to goal rather than run in behind his marker.  It's like he doesn't trust his control or the delivery, so wants to do one-two's that are easier.

I like him and sympathise.  Not knowing if he will ever get back to his best is the worst part; at least if he was a crock this season and never played we'd know for sure he was never getting back to his prime.  At the moment, we're still speculating if it's confidence, supply or whatever.

7954~~~
He must be being instructed to come short rather than running beyond. Part of LVG's ball retention philosophy. Needs to be let off the leash

7955~~~
Emmerdale? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

7956~~~
Last summer it was said that he was willing to take a huge pay cut, more than 50%, in order to quit Monaco.

7957~~~
The strange thing is that I thought he actually looked quite promising at the beginning of the year. Sure his shooting was a bit rusty, but he was getting into position to score and showing one or two moments of class every game (that cross to RVP...) Granted I didn't see this last game, but he really has been bereft of form in the last few months, and it's happened at a time when he should be his healthiest, which is strange.

7958~~~
I've never quite understood the mercenary charge against Falcao. Moving to Porto and then to Atletico were both clearly cases of a player moving to a club more deserving of his talents (no disrespect to Porto.) Moving to Monaco might appear to be a head-scratcher in hindsight, but that summer they were throwing the money around to put together a club that could compete with PSG; hence the likes of Moutinho and James joining them (by the way, is James a mercenary for having joined Real after only one season at Monaco?) Falcao is in dire form, but from a personality standpoint, he certainly comes across as a top professional (and unlikeable as Mendes might be, I hardly think we can fault Falcao for employing the top agent in the game.)

7959~~~
So he was being paid over 500,000 a week by Monaco...? 

No wonder they're so desperate to get rid of him!

7960~~~
What??

He is still under contract with Monaco we are paying his current 260k wage, but apparently he is willing to ask a lot less from his new club.

Edit: And since Monaco is tax free for non-french, it is indeed as if he was paid 500K, elsewhere.

7961~~~
I think there is something like 14% tax on player wages in Monaco. So if his gross wage (which is what the media uses) is 250k a week then his net wage would be a lot more playing for Monaco than playing for us. That could be it.

7962~~~
That's exactly what I thought. WTF?

7963~~~
Ah yeah the French tax thing, we were kinda both right.

On his 'willing to except a lot less from his new club', lets be honest - he doesn't have a choice!

At present Falcao has to be the <i>most overpaid player in Europe</i>, and it's us who's paying him.

7964~~~
He could stay at Monaco, but he doesn't want that at all.

7965~~~
Neither do they, they're desperate to get rid of him, so I'm not sure he could stay there actually.

7966~~~
Yeah...

7967~~~
Have this horrible feeling that the club will sign him ,

7968~~~
He has a contract, he could stay and the coach wants him. But since they changed the game plan and want to emulate Porto, they prefer to get rid of all the big wages.

7969~~~
Let's be honest here, if he SOMEHOW manages to get the crucial goals against Liverpool and the other big teams in the next few weeks then he will get a free pass to be here next season.

7970~~~
That's why I think Moutinho would be a great signing for a lot of clubs in the Summer.

7971~~~
He's from Yorkshire, geddit?

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/made-yorkshire-manchester-united-star-4446481" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/made-yorkshire-manchester-united-star-4446481</a>

7972~~~
He will stay, I think that it's Toulalan who will leave.

7973~~~
feck sake, I thought it was because the end of his name was pronounced cow.

7974~~~
It worked for Forlan.

7975~~~
Forlan was in his early 20s, he was already a Manchester United player and he was on a salary at the lower end of our wage structure. Falcao is nearly 29 and he's one of the most paid players in the club. The club would expect more then 1-2 goals in key games from him.

7976~~~
As it was said here on prev page Shearer rightly pointed out on MOTD how he doesnt make any runs behind defense, plays with his back towards goal the whole time and comes for ball too much. There were few instances when his run could have opened space for him but he didnt do it. Is it lack of confidence or sthing else I dont know.

7977~~~
And therein lies the problem - He's no longer got the attributes required to run in behind. His pace is completely shot, his touch isn't good enough and he doesn't seem to be strong enough to hold off opponents... all the attributes you need to run in behind.

Mind you, two of those attributes are required when you come towards the ball as well... which is why he's rubbish when does that... we basically have a the poorest excuse for a striker in the shape of him when he plays up front.

7978~~~
It seems so. 

There was one bit when he lost the ball to Wes Brown nesr the middle and from that Sunderland ran to a dangerous counter. It was so easy for Brown to take the ball and Falcao even fell to the ground. To make things worse he falls so easily nowadays.

7979~~~
I thought it was a shite decision to take him off tbh. Granted he was crap for most of the game, but he'd just pulled off a great touch and won us a pen plus they went down to 10 men. Was pretty much the perfect time to to let him play on and see if he could build on that.

7980~~~
Falcao had produced nothing in the game apart from that great touch which United's legend John Oshea had seen it fit to foolishly clatter him inside the box. Once he was off the pitch United played better with Rooney providing better movement and finishing skills then him.

Its time we stop cuddling our players. One touch is not enough to keep your first team place.

7981~~~
this is my fear... that he gets that opportunity.

I so hope we start Mata in the hole and Rooney upfront for those games.

7982~~~
If he gets the winner v liverpool

I'll get a tattoo of his name to my forehead

7983~~~
I did say he was crap and I said nothing about him starting any more games. But we do pay him plenty of money so might as well try to get anything we can out of him for the rest of the season.

7984~~~
We paid 6m for a one year loan. Its up to him to prove that he deserve a permanent deal. Falcao provide no resale value, he's on a high salary and he's at the wrong end of his career. He's brought in as a quick fix. If he can't provide that then we might as well give game time to OUR younger talent such as Wilson.

7985~~~
Shearer is bang on in motd. We should go after him as a striker coach.

7986~~~
Yep, he's going to give up on a €200k a week job and pursue a career in a €10k a month job.

7987~~~
I don't know what you're talking about anymore. I agree Falcao has been shite and there's no way we should be signing him this summer. But, we do have him on loan until the end of the season. Him doing well, is still in our best interests for now. I don't see how taking him off for Fellaini yesterday did him any good at all. Why not keep him on and see if he bags a couple of goals and gets his confidence back? I'm not seeing any downsides here...

7988~~~
Please Note this is Red4Ever <span style="color: #ff0000">NOT</span> Red for Ever that is saying this

7989~~~
I don't think you are wrong in your posts, but will he be dropped for the next game for Rooney or Wilson? If not, then it would have been more prudent to have kept him on to build his confidence. May be he would have scored a goal or two with them being down to 10 men. 

I have read your posts, you have been watching football for a long time, won't you say that confidence and goals are the most important for a striker? Sometimes you score one after a drought and then go on to score 5 or 6 in the following games. It has happened with Rooney a lot times.

7990~~~
He is currently one of the worst strikers in the league easily which is crazy when you think about his past achievements.

7991~~~
You now this could very well happen. An under performing South American player who pops up to make the scousers cry. That has never happened before.

7992~~~
As said, Falcao is a one year loan deal and the year is nearly over. He hasn't provided us with the performances needed to convince us spending 45m on him so he's as good as gone. Why waste our time flogging this dead horse? We might as well give game time to someone whose here for good and would benefit from having some first team experience (ex Wilson).

His substitution allowed Rooney to play upfront which gave United's forwardline some composure and credibility. Its too early to say if that may have sorted our forward line problems. Sunderland were after all with 10 men at that point. Nevertheless I hope that Rooney's performance upfront gave LVG some food for thought. We do have a quality striker if we need him

7993~~~
There is a correlation between confidence and goals however time is running out. Falcao one year contract is close to its end and I believe that both LVG and himself had made their minds up. At 28 Falcao provide no resale value, he hasnt justified his stay and looks set to leave. We might as well give the game time to someone else whose here to stay and whose future is directly tied to our fortune. 

Honestly I cant care less of Falcao to be honest. What I care about is that we get to at least the 4th place. We've got more chance of achieving that if we play strikers whose got plenty of experience in scoring goals for us (ie Rooney) and with an actual midfielder in midfield. 

LVG should also think about himself and be more ruthless. He doesn't have the luxury to play an off form striker that may, one day, return to his former glory. FFS if doesn't get United to the top 4 then no amount of philosophy and brilliant CV will save him from the sack.

7994~~~
29*

<span style="font-size: 10px">*Going on 33</span>

7995~~~
On form, Falcao/Rooney should not be being picked over Rooney/Mata. Not in a million. We really lack both Mata's creativity and Rooney's better goalscoring at the moment.

7996~~~
Again, I cannot disagree with the post. If it was upto me, I would have sent him back in January with a best wishes card and a thank you note each for Monaco and Mendes. 

That is not the debate though, right? He is here, we are in a tough fight in the league and the manager has been picking him. To take him off at that point was not the right decision, imo. And I guess, that is what the other poster is debating with you.

7997~~~
Why not?

a- He contributing very little to the game apart from causing unnecessary nervousness to United's legend (tm) John OShea. I believe that such legend (tm) wouldnt clatter Falcao in the box 2-3 times in a row wouldn't he? 

b- Once we got the penalty, we needed to secure the lead, Fellaini and Rooney cover more inches of pitch then Falcao does.

7998~~~
He has the attributes, but for some reason his timing is completely off, he is reactive instead of being proactive. Most of the time he makes the run that he should have made 3 seconds earlier and most of the time, he is very close.

Edit: The other thing that tells me that it's only in his head, is the fact that he refuses to use his left foot to shot, he has a great left foot but with us he always try to put the ball on the right foot.

7999~~~
He did show a glimpse of his class with the two touches that led to the winning of that penalty, but no-one can argue those moments have been too few and far between. Unless he dramatically improves his productivity in the upcoming games, there's no way the club can entertain paying a huge fee for him.

It really is a shame how much serious injuries can have on players, affecting their physical or mental capacities (sometimes both). Falcao has demonstrably lost a yard of pace, which in turn seems to had a telling impact on his confidence. There's no way the Falcao at Porto or Atletico would be missing the types of chances that we've seen him regularly botch at United. I feel for him as you can see that he's trying his utmost to make it work at United, but his best years appear to be well and truly past him.

8000~~~
The sub was probably already decided and Fellaini was getting ready to come on just before Falcao was brought down, I think.

8001~~~
Can't agree with you mate. When Falcao is shown the ball in the area he can be deadly and Saturday showed it. As soon as he gets the chance defenders literally try to smother him. Our problem has been supplying him in areas beyond the half way line. Once LVG gets the supply system going Falcao and the other strikers will prove a handful 

As to taking him off after penalty, I thought it was a strange decision. He made the breakthrough that no United player had up to that point. He had become untouchable after the penalty, as Sunderland defenders would have been cautious of closing in on him. That might have increased our chances.

I thought plan B failed again with Fellaini. He really didn't make the mark he has in other games. Pumping the high balls didn't alter things. Once we went back to feet and Valencia opened up the flank the second goal came. The kind that Falcao was bought to score.

8002~~~
I think you're overestimating Falcao's performance to be honest. He passed much of the game inside Wes Brown pockets and only became dangerous when the great United's legend John OShea 'defended' against him. You do have a point that we are struggling in creating chances. Nevertheless when a striker is playing in a 2 men forward line formation then he is expected to contribute greatly to the team. Both Falcao and RVP had been disappointing in terms of movement and creativity.

Ultimately a striker is judged by his goals and Falcao hasn't scored enough. There's nothing to justify his role in the team

8003~~~
I wouldn't even be giving him too much credit for the penalty tbh. I would have been far more impressed if he'd shown the strength and balance to convert the chance he created for himself. It was a nice (but by no means amazing) touch and he still ended up going down like a sack of shit under the merest hint of contact from the defender, then scuffing his shot wide. All of which has been a persistent theme for him this season.

8004~~~
this

8005~~~
Feeling sorry for him is difficult considering what he earns and the job he has but, in context, you have to have a little sympathy for him (Unless your name is successful). He seems a genuinely nice bloke who has had his career decimated by two injuries. He should be in his prime knocking the goals in and earning his final payday but the reality is that he's probably going to find it pretty tough to convince anyone to pick up the tab for him. 

There's no way in hell anyone is going to pay what Monaco want <b>and </b>pay him what he expects or at least would be earning without those injuries. It could be a little embarrassing for him this summer if nobody comes forward.

8006~~~
Guilty by name association, unfortunately for you.

8007~~~
No, that's just silly. It was an excellent touch, and there was no way he could've done any better to get to the ball. He didn't go down like a sack of shit under the merest hint of contact from the defender', he was completely stopped and was pretty much shoved. Like everyone I thought he was overall poor but saying that the peno he won was anything else than a showing of very good ability is stupid.

8008~~~
Watch the replay. O'Shea put a hand on his shoulder. Brown didn't even touch him. He was leaning back and went down far too easily.

8009~~~
Agree with this. O'Shea pulled him back which clearly stopped him getting a proper contact on the ball – even so he still managed to connect.

8010~~~
Thing is, his first touch is so bad 99% of the time, that a little bit of me wonders whether that touch for the penalty wasn't a complete accident....

8011~~~
He was also clipped by O'Shea, he also held him arm.

8012~~~
He really didn't, I don't even understand how anyone can argue that.

8013~~~
You don't stay on your feet in this kind of situations, O'shea puts him off balance with his leg and then pull him backwards.

8014~~~
It depends what you mean by accident. He's done that type of stuff loads in his career, so it's more a throwback to his best days than 'an accident' (like if Heskey had done something like that). It could be an accident in that this throwback won't occur again this season though. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

8015~~~
That's crazy, he was blatantly pulled down. The fact that he was still trying to get his shot away instead of just accepting the penalty only highlights it. Just look at the above video!

8016~~~
More like he just shoved his leg there and hoped for the best, as opposed to "controlling it" (in that he knew exactly where the ball would fall).

Like you said though - he probably fully meant every bit of it, as his career would point to a man that is more than capable... but based on this season, I can't help but be a bit cynical!

8017~~~
It was a penalty. The legend did smothered him.

8018~~~
The video isn't working for me. The way I remember it, he was pulled back by O'Shea but a stronger, better balanced striker would have still worked the keeper. For a big, strong bloke he does have an uncanny ability to fall over far too easily.

I could be wrong though. Will need to look at another replay.

8019~~~
He definitely does, but I think the penalty situation isn't a fair reflection of that, as he was genuinely pulled back.

8020~~~
Have to agree with you, he was seriously manhandled and pulled down hence why the shot was so ineffectual as he collapsed.

 This morning there are claims that Valencia want him next season. We have certainly failed to get the best out of him and suspect he will be sent packing. My concern is that with our existing supply system, it's unlikely we will find a suitable replacement.

8021~~~
I was just thinking about that, Diego Costa or Ronaldo go down on this one, Falcao is turning a few seconds before it's a critical moment in term of balance.
It's because, he is powerful that he gives the impression that it was nothing.

8022~~~
In fact that vid just says to me that we're using him the wrong way. Comes alive in the box, like Hernandez used to.

8023~~~
To be fair though, Hernandez can do things outside of the box too that Falcao seemingly can't... namely run into the box with any great speed/conviction.

Also, I'd say thats more an isolated incident then actually "Coming alive in the box" ... he generally never seems to be in the right place in the area to pick up the ball/loose ends/get on the end of crosses.

8024~~~
I think he's being affected by the fact that he's playing for a permanent deal and the pressure is getting to him. LVG commented a while back about how Falcao would score any chance given to him in training (I'm paraphrasing) but you'd think that he was on about a different player when you look at Falcao's past games.

With Young back in what one would refer to as "respectable" form and RVP out, playing Young, Mata/Rooney and Di Maria/Mata/Januzaj behind Falcao should in theory be enough key passers to create decent amount of goal-scoring opportunities for him to slot home at least a couple of more goals before the dust has settled.

8025~~~
You could argue the first touch had an element of luck, but then all first touches do at that speed. The 2nd touch is definitely on purpose and quick thinking. That was a glimpse of the Falcao of old, if only he could show that more often we wouldn't be having these discussions.

Like other's have said though, the rest of his game is too low a level to be a starter at our club, he is playing even worse than Hernandez, no way is he worth the money Monaco want.

8026~~~
I was a big Chico fan but Falcao looks the more complete deal as a footballer. His speed over 5 yards and anticipation in the box is quite something. His lay off to Rooney for a goal earlier this season was impressive. Making him collect the ball 10 yards around the half way line however, seems to be a waste of his talents. We should pump balls at him in around the box as we did for Teddy S.

8027~~~
Don't necessarily agree with that, maybe not so much these past few matches but his movement in the box is overall excellent. He usually makes 3 or 4 different runs in just one chance. For a while, there was just absolutely no service to him. Now there's a bit more, not much, but a bit more, but he's a bit rusty in that aspect.

8028~~~
True. It happened against Sunderland, great ball in from Young, no one in the six yard box. But is some of that to do with how we're set up? Playing in front of teams all the time and not using the wingers enough – hard for a forward to get on the end of stuff if that's not the consistent set-up? Or am I being too kind? Saying that he needs to make runs in behind – but the whole team needs to do more of that too. In the first half we were very static again.

8029~~~
Yeah that could well be right. Maybe signing him on a permanent deal, from the start, would have let him play with less pressure. 

It's been weird for him. He started well, but failed to quickly get that first goal. Was still putting in decent performances but the pressure was clearly increasing. Then he got injured, and the same cycle got repeated, but with poorer and less certain performances.

8030~~~
I would go with this. I was surprised, and quite chuffed, at the applause he got when he was subbed on Saturday. The fans are so willing him to ignite. And it clearly was appreciated by him.

8031~~~
That's worth trying. When it comes to attacking balls inside the box, he's far better than Fellaini IMO. 

I don't think we've used Falcao or RvP correctly this season. They've not played particularly well either but they could be used better.

8032~~~
Maybe I'm focusing too much on his movement from the Preston and this game (both of which I made a point of paying attention to him - to see if the often mooted "but his movement is great" stuff actually rang true - particularly Saturday as it's easier to do at the game) where his movement was, honest to god, atrocious.

The irony is of course that he didn't actually move much to receive the ball for the penalty... maybe that's where he's going wrong!

8033~~~
If we were all true to ourselves I think we all know the quality that's lurking there and perhaps bursting to come out. Not sure all this psycho stuff influences him on the pitch though. He took his chance on Saturday which suggests his mindset is not effected; but the supply he's been offered thus far has been pretty barren.

8034~~~
I agree with Scholes to a certain degree. Words to the effect of "a side is only as good as its strikers." We lack cohesion; too slow at coming out of our area, and don't cope with being pressed high up. In those conditions it's unlikely any striker in any club will do much more than twiddle their thumbs. 

The only solution is to play the strikers higher up and drive balls at them to force the opponent to back off. Once faced with one-on-ones and flank attacks, teams will become more reluctant to fill the middle with boxes or press higher up. Since Xmas we have faced this problem and LVG has been unable to find a good solution. I think it's time to pepper the strikers with long passes and play with wingers, until we can get the midfield moving forward aggressively again.

8035~~~
This. He makes a lot of runs, short movements looking for passes and dummies and balls are very often not sent his way or over hit. Di Maria was guilty of so many poor passes his way in the first half.

If we're looking for movement up top, then the 4-2-3-1 is the way to go with Rooney behind. We'll have higher ball retention up the pitch, Falcao's service *should* improve and we will create chances. Plus with any combination of Mata, Di Maria, Januzaj and Young either side of Rooney, we'll have decent to good movement which is far better than we've seen so far this season.

8036~~~
I would agree with you if the attacking midfielders were making headway but a lot of the time they end up boxed in. We need to create more space, speed up our movement, and increase supply. The solution is well supplied conventional wingers with two strikers up front - classic 4-4-2. The midfield are now so predictable they are ineffective for quite a long time in games.

8037~~~
Said this about the Shevchenko comparisons ages ago.
He's done, his runs aren't with the same intensity or pace they used to be, he can't hold defenders off anymore and he can't run past them. His touch has also been appalling, it's not a coincidence we score from the first chance in the game where the ball came to Falcao and he wasn't instantly brushed aside or shinned it into no mans land. It's the same with RvP, they're both finished.

We need a striker who is difficult to play against, not just scoring clear chances we create. Aguero, Costa, Suarez, Lewandowski, Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar, Benzema, Ibra etc. all get the ball and make something happen themselves every now and again regardless of service. They're scary to play against because they can force mistakes rather than relying on a perfect pass or someone to feck up of their own accord. None of our strikers really do this anymore and they haven't since RvP in Fergies last season.

8038~~~
He was probably taken off to save him for the game on Wednesday, I don’t know how or why but he seems to be someone LVG wants to play pretty much every game despite his really poor performances. Having had a look at him it would seem inevitable we will send him back to Monaco without even a second thought based on his age, the cost and his performances but I have this horrible feeling we will buy him. It would be a terrible signing but I can’t really see any explanation for why he continues to play regularly at the expense of other players.

8039~~~

Very good point. Except those players have got squads behind them that do ensure their supply. They can make something happen because their squads are functioning more effectively. We have efficiency to some extent but no effectiveness and that is exposing Falcao and others. BTW is Lewandowski having a prolific time at the moment?


I thought that too, perhaps another 15 minutes before subbing might have been better for everyone if the decision had been set in stone.

8040~~~
The modern game is so super-athletic that if you don't have a striker that can contribute in more than one way then you're going to find it hard to make up for it. Most strikers do that by being able to drop out of the box and link up play, as Aguero, Benzema & Rooney do. Some do it by working and pressing defenders incredibly hard, like Costa or Lewandowski. Some double as wide players, like Ronaldo or Messi. Suarez ticks all these boxes. 

Falcao got away with it at Atleti simply by being a crazily good finisher. What his highlights reel and there's every type of goal from every bit of the box. Service involved him simply having the ball, not getting chances on a plate ready to finish.

But if he's not at that crazy level of finishing, and he has nothing else to offer, then he's simply a standard striker.

8041~~~
I disagreed with you when you first floated that Shevchenko comparison but it's looking more and more like it was on the money. I also think you're right about RvP (something I've been thinking myself since last season) All of which is fecking depressing but there you go.

8042~~~
Could be the end of the road.

8043~~~
Or exciting?

Love me some new strikers I do.

8044~~~
At this point, even if Monaco dropped their asking price it would be a poor purchase. By next season Wilson will hopefully have bulked up a bit, and Europe is full of promising looking strikers who are worth a punt at £10M-£15M or so. Its always possible that he'll roar back into form at any moment, but frankly it's far more likely he won't.

Sad though, he's a really likeable guy.

8045~~~
I just get the feeling RF is a brace away from kicking on.  One good solid performance could be the turning point, but i'm basing that on past showings and nothing he has done in a United shirt, mind.
Its just boggles the mind how poor he is this season compared to his previous ability, he looks a totally different player - lets hope it's all in his head and he can get over it.
Regardless of what happens between now and the end of the season, there is no way on earth Monaco are going to get anything close to 25m for him.

8046~~~
I suspect we will be looking at a new striker in the summer. Falcao won't be signed (unless Mendes really is as conniving as he is portrayed) and Van Persie will probably still be here but as a back up on the last year of his contract. I'm genuinely surprised by how bad Van Persie has gotten, he just doesn't contribute and so no one is likely to come in for him in the summer.

The depressing aspect for me is that it has taken an injury for us to drop Van Persie. We should have reverted to Rooney up front a while ago.

8047~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Of course you do, you Muppet supreme, you. 

That being said at this point I'm also starting to think we need a new striker. But I would love to bring in a young (u23) striker talent and play Rooney up top until he turns shit as well or our youngster can show he is better than Rooney.

8048~~~
Angelo Henriquez maybe?

8049~~~
Good news, hopefully it's true.

8050~~~
If the manager wants to go with one up top he needs only three strikers, he has that in Rooney, RVP and Wilson but if he wants Rooney to play behind the striker then he could do with signing one.

8051~~~
Got a good feeling about tonight. Reckon he scores 2.

8052~~~
Good news! Time to look out for some good young strikers/forwards.

8053~~~
We should have made up our own L'equipe quotes months ago. Its destined to happen tonight!!!

8054~~~
You're about the 20th person to say this this season. It would represent a 50% increase on his goals tally this season so would be very impressive.

8055~~~
The last good feeling I had was Liverpool at home. Take from that what you will.

8056~~~
If true Rooney should be up top from now on .... Wilson given chances and Mata more time at 10.

8057~~~
Yeah Newcastle typically play open football so there's a good chance will get a few chances to put away.

8058~~~
I take from that that you don't get good feelings very often, they're not based on anything concrete and they have feck all effect on a group of 11 men playing a game of football 300 miles away.

8059~~~
I feel sorry for the guy because we create bugger all in games. Stick him in the Liverpool team and he'd score loads.

8060~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8061~~~
We have scored more than Liverpool so far this season

8062~~~
But they haven't had any strikers. Now Sturridge is back they look strong again.

8063~~~
Then why hasn't Balotelli or Lambert done well there? Liverpool are all about mobility and interplay. Falcao wouldn't fit. Rooney would score loads up front, though.

8064~~~
I don't think he'll suddenly have the ability to "switch it on" and score a hat-trick tonight and loads before the end of the season... his ability has all but deserted him - he is no longer even capable of doing half of things not only that he used to do, but that any striker operating at a high level can do.

8065~~~
I'm not so sure and that would mean he's in form its just that our style doesnt suit him, and its not that simple.

8066~~~
Maybe I'm just disappointed. When we signed him and Di Maria I thought we'd be back, and we're still shite.

8067~~~
Rooney has scored 3 in his last 3 upfront. We aren't creating a shed load, but RvP and Falcao certainly aren't putting the ones we are away.

8068~~~
No idea whether he goes or stays. Despite who comes in, the issues however will be exactly the same in my opinion. New players to the league take at least a year to settle in general. Young players introduced into the team can take even longer to find consistency. So let's buy a foreign young striker then....and see how long it takes the vultures to start circling about his performances!!!

I love the throw away comments like lets buy a striker like world class players are really available out there. Do people think we are the only team looking for world class players? Unfortunately, at present we can only sign players for ridiculously over priced money, and then that's based on the players are so called competitors don't want. Does anyone think DM would be here if Real wanted to keep him.

I suggest we be careful what we wish for.......

8069~~~
Me too. Something about St. James' and proper #9s.

Falcao has been largely poor for us, but I think things could have been very different if not for a few moments things could have gone very differently. I think the injury after the goal at Everton was very untimely, plus all the back-and-forthing with Columbia in general to be honest. I also think the volleyed-lob against Leicester that came back off the underside of the bar would have changed things. Narrative plays a part in football, and confidence cannot be high for Falcao. At the point of the Leicester game, the narrative was all about our dream strikeforce that was going to blow teams away. They had just craqpped on QPR, and had begun the game against Leicester in the same vein. Di Maria scored a stunner, Falcao assisted Persie brilliantly.. If we had gone on to win that with that Falcao lob, it would have perpetuated that theme, opponents would start to fear it too, and confidence would be high for Falcao.

I think a good few weeks early on would have led to a different Falcao. As it stands, I can't argue that he has been far from good enough though.

8070~~~
That Leicester game.. ugh.. If we had won it comfotbably like we should have our season might have been a bit different.

8071~~~
The yard of pace and bit of acceleration he has lost has just killed him as a world class player, he can't run behind anymore and every time the ball gets played into him defenders know he can't turn them and he doesn't have the strength or control to play with his back to goal. 

I only see him being effective if he is in a team where everything is served on a plate to him or he plays in a less competitive league. The story today about us deciding not to sign him should be the only outcome and is the best decision going forward. Hope he doesn't start tonight, fed up of watching him losing the ball and he just doesn't contribute enough.

8072~~~
What I dont understand is that he dont even tries to run behind.

8073~~~
Cuz he knows his lack of pace will be totally exposed?

If every man and his dog has noticed that Falcao looks woefully slow in the PL, I'm sure he's noticed it himself too and I doubt he wants to show that off.

8074~~~
I'm 100% convinced we would have been comfortable in the top 4 now if we had won it. It shattered the teams confidence a bit, and it also caused LvG to try the 3-5-2 formation to remedy our defensive troubles.

8075~~~
Yeah.
he has lost pace and acceleration and cause of that lost a lot of confidence too.

8076~~~
Yeah, thinks so to... It all looked so great until that penalty...

8077~~~
Can't be much more uneffective than him running 20 yards back into midfield showing for the ball, then getting it, being knocked off the ball and losing it again in less than 2 seconds.

8078~~~
Keeping him definitely won't resolve anything and will be a complete waste of money. Not every player needs time to adapt and even if we can't find someone who is world class finding someone who can perform better than falcao has done won't be too difficult. At least with a younger player there is the potential for improvement in the future as well, falcao will be 30 within six months of signing for us permanently in the summer and will cost a fortune.

Best case scenario is he scores a few goals to help us finish in the top 4 and to salvage his reputation and earns a move somewhere else.

8079~~~
Yeah, that was the turning point <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Wasn't even a pen! Oh well..

8080~~~
He knows he can't do it anymore, he looks like he is running through treacle anytime he does try to run. He is also clearly suffering from a lack of confidence, regaining some would improve him a bit but the pace and the acceleration  are gone for good and given his age are only going to deteriorate further reasonably soon.

8081~~~
Definitely a turning point.

8082~~~
The good news to come out of this is, at least we'll be in for a new striker in the summer, which is always exciting. Funny that it's the last area you'd of thought we'd seriously need to address this coming summer. Typical of our luck sometimes..

8083~~~
It's exciting but it's also an incredibly hard position to fill. Fergie had a midas touch but the game is full of really good managers who have had a terrible time finding a top class reliable striker for their team.

8084~~~
Yeah IMO he did start very brightly and a few more early goals...this thread and our season could have turned out very differently. That fecking Leicester game <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

8085~~~
At least this gets him the 'works hard' and 'great attitude' image though.

Of course you're right, but most fans don't care, or realise, that he shouldn't be doing this and indeed <i>can't</i> do this.

He'd be better saving his energy and constantly playing off the shoulder, but like I said, his utter lack of pace would then completely laid bare.

8086~~~
I feel the opposite (in regards to a brace doing wonders)... It's not like he's making runs and creating chances but not capitalising. He's simply invisible out there (not rvp hasn't been himself) and I can't see how a two goal game is going to increase his foot speed, which I think is his biggest problem right now.

8087~~~
If people were even considering paying 40m for Falcao (which they were), surely a 50m bid for for Kane would be worth a go. Rather than waiting two seasons and paying 80m for him or watching go to a rival.

That lad up front with Rooney behind him would be immense.

8088~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> yeah it's the same thing every game. "He will start banging them in".

8089~~~
It is a big shame that it did not work out or is not working out.

I still hope he can show the old Falcao.

8090~~~
If we don't sign him (which I hope we don't) then I just hope he doesn't sign for another English club.

8091~~~
Wasn't there a stat saying Falcao only had like 5 assists in his entire career before moving to United? Now he's already equalled that.

8092~~~
Admittedly I don't watch a massive amount of European football, but when I do very few strikers really impress me. I think we'll end up having to take a punt on buying a player on the way up rather than proven quality. The problem for us is, in the past we've been able to do that with top strikers there to bridge the gap while they develop. Now we have Falcao who looks past it and likely won't be here, RvP who looks like he might be on the way down the opposite side of the hill, Rooney who he seems not to fancy that much up there and Wilson who is full of promise, but who is also green at this level. I don't think it's beyond the realm that we'll have a very patchy frontline next season.

8093~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8094~~~
It's not funny, I quite like him and it'd be a shame to have to hate him if he joined the dippers or something. 

Plus you just know he'd suddenly remember how to be a striker.

8095~~~
No chance another English club takes a chance on him for the money he'd cost. Most of 'em still can't afford him and Chelsea and City already have much better strikers.

8096~~~
Sorry I thought it was a joke – you must admit it was a funny sentence! I like him too.

8097~~~
Yea I'm not being 100% serious, like <a class="username" data-user="48866, @KiD MoYeS" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/48866/">@KiD MoYeS</a> said I don't see any other PL club wanting him. 

I'm just a natural pessimist in these situations and can imagine him joining a rival and scoring 45 goals.

8098~~~
Something like that is absolutely nailed on to happen.

8099~~~
'All he needs is a goal' <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

How many times have we heard that? As if one goal is going to suddenly fix his first touch, erratic finishing, return his pace, build his strength etc etc Plus, he's scored 4 this season, and still looked as crap as ever in the following games.

8100~~~
Exactly. Yet apparently, rather then that being a weakness on Falcao's part, thats just proof that the team is rubbish.

Never have I seen a 'world class' forward need so much perfect service. Even a pass a yard overhit and he's got no chance.

8101~~~
Yup. Just like Shevchenko when he left Chelsea. Or Torres when he left Liverpool. Watch Falcao go. He'll leave us and after 4 years of playing like an amputee on sedatives...BAM!, he'll get a few goals in cup games.

8102~~~
I don't want to see him start tonight. He has lost a yard or two through injury and he has bottled it as well. We have seen that play out over the season. He has had enough chances. We don't need to continue to flogging a dead horse, we need to find a Falcaoless solution.

Personally I would rather see Rooney up top with Mata playing as the number ten.

8103~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8104~~~
Yeah, I'm cut from the same cloth. Every time we let anyone go I have a nagging fear he'll look amazing at a different club. With Falcao's reputation and age, it's inevitable that if he went to the dippers we'd see him doing this sort of shit again.

If that happens, I'm giving up on football altogether.

8105~~~
Judging from his ability (or lack of it thesedays) to even strike a ball cleanly, I doubt we'll be seeing too much of this ^^ again.

8106~~~
He did hit a rather sexy volley off the bar against Leicester.

Of course, most great strikers will be able to strike a ball cleanly long past the point at which they can play top flight football. So that's neither here nor there.

8107~~~
He has three years left on his Monaco contract, no other club in the Premiership will cover  bit more than half his wages. For that reason I suspect he will be a Monaco player next year.

8108~~~
One volley in what, 7 months?

In general, his ball striking technique is horrible, he scuffs at everything.

8109~~~
He can barely control a football, there's no way he'll miraculously become good again next season.

8110~~~
His balance and mobility seems to be the main issue. Seems to be always off-balance or struggling to sort his feet out. I'm sure he's still quite capable of striking a ball cleanly in the right circumstances. But you know this, as you remember the volley I'm talking about.

8111~~~
He's proving the "haters" right, unfortunately. I've long gone with the "he's gonna come back with couple goals and his confidence will restore" cliche but it's March already and that hasn't happened yet and it doesn't look like so in the near future at least. I just don't see any sort of improvement from him for us any more.

8112~~~
'In the right circumstances'. That actually sums him up quite well. 

I'm sure he can still strike a call perfectly from a standing start with no pressure, but his lack of balance (as you point out) means that in a match situation he struggles to make any kind of clean contact. He's constantly falling over and miss hitting shots. That why I'm not worried that if he left he'd start banging them in again like he did in those videos you posted, especially not in the PL. Physically he just looks shot.

8113~~~
I don't disagree with that. He just looks so clumsy.

I'll still expect him to score a tonne of goals if he goes to Liverpool. As irrational as that seems.

8114~~~
Carlos Tevez syndrome <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Realistically, he wouldn't even get in that Liverpool team though (as depressing as it is to write that)

8115~~~
Someone has to fill the falling-over-in-the-middle-of-the-field role when Gerrard retires. Plus his first touch will have the same sort of range as Gerrard's passing.

8116~~~
I love Falcao, and think that if he actually got some decent service, he would perform.

I also think if he was able to get the ball in positions other than him with his back to goal, with only a backwards pass on, we'd see more from him.

Our attacking play is shit under LvG....I blame him

8117~~~
That would involve Falcao doing something other than waiting to receive the ball with his back to goal. You know, make some fecking runs. Something that's been almost completely absent from his game so far.

8118~~~

8119~~~
What like Danny Welbeck? Potential is only and no more than that. How many potential young players here have never fulfil their potential? Not saying to keep him but I'd say we have massive problems because RVP looks like he's on the downward spiral....

8120~~~
Amen.

Not sure how people are missing this. You can blame the service, but it must be incredibly hard to supply a striker that doesn't make any runs.

8121~~~
Make runs whilst we are playing the ball side to side and back again. Stats say we have played more back passes than any other team in the league.

8122~~~
Where else can they pass it when the two strikers are just standing there? Play it in behind, neither can get on the end of it. Play it to feet, they inevitably lose it. Stick Ageuro or Sturridge in this team and we'd look infinitely better.

8123~~~
Rubbish. The build up is slow and predictable. That's absolutely nothing to do with the strikers or their runs. How do you know whether the strikers havent been told that's how LVG wants them to play. Do you think he'd be starting if he was doing the opposite?

8124~~~
I'm sure if we sort out the movement upfront then getting the ball forward more quickly will follow.

There's no way we can sign him though, unless it has already been agreed. I don't care if he scores 40 goals next season, the very thought of him doing that is laughable at the moment, he hasn't shown anything worth having this year.

8125~~~
Arguably had his best performance against Newscastle at Old Trafford. Will probably start tonight.

8126~~~
disagree. Our passing has been poor all season. We give the ball away too easy. Our crossing has been poor. We have a lack of creativity in the side. Our play is slow and predictable.....watch Arsenal, Liverpool, City or Spurs in how quick they move the ball.....we'd sooner go backwards than take risk.

8127~~~
There's no way the manager wants us to play this poorly. There are a few problems in the team which are fairly solvable, and once they are the rest will click into place.

8128~~~
If it's true then I hope we give Wilson a chance to break through with a good run with Rooney as a #10! 

If LVG goes 4-3-3 then we will probably play Rooney!

8129~~~
Agree but it's not the fact the strikers aren't making runs which is solely the problem. The problems are much more entrenched than that. Falcao has been a disappointment but bar Blind and DDG, the rest have generally been consistently very poor all season

8130~~~
Potential is a gamble but falcao is an even bigger one because he is in the latter stages of his career and hasn't even come close to showing he has recovered from his last injury. I would rather have someone who is on the way up rather than someone who hasn't had a good game for two years. RVP is on a downward spiral but so is falcao signing him as a replacement would be a terrible decision.

8131~~~
Exactly and how many of our attacks break down because he can't control the ball or gets bullied by the centre half. Of course the service to him could be better but when you look around the league there are a number of strikers who would be able to creat things for themselves and make more of the service.

8132~~~
Surprised he didn't get on the pitch today. Fans were chanting his name, but it seems his United career will be short lived.

8133~~~
Another baffling sub from LVG to bring on Carrick ahead of him when we needed a goal. If we hadn't scored, I could've seen that being a far bigger talking point.

8134~~~
Need a goal and we pick a holding midfielder leading to a tactical change instead of him.

8135~~~
He would've added nothing.

8136~~~
Everyone bitching for Falcao to be broughf on at the end. You feckers were baying for his blood at the weekend.

8137~~~
Can you see into alternate universes?

8138~~~
Delighted he didn't show at any point to be honest... I don't think he'd have added anything.

8139~~~
Given his recent form I don'tdon't see what the point in bringing him on would be.

8140~~~
He can see into everything Falcao has done for United so far, which is nothing. It would be likier that his touch would have been shit, they got the ball and then scored from the counter than him nicking in a goal.

8141~~~
van Gaal continues this pattern of starting Falcao one week and then him getting 0 minutes the next.

8142~~~
Safe to say Falcao is officially toast at this club now.

8143~~~
So people now moan cause we wasnt subbed on. 

O tempora o mores. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8144~~~
People can laugh all they want but not bringing him on was ridiculous really. You need a goal you dont take your most dangerous player off for someone even more wasteful after 55 minutes then wait till the 80th to bring on Mata. Shocking subs again. All rosy now though because of a fluke goal at the end.

8145~~~
I'm not so much commenting on his potential usefulness, as the logic of having a striker (any striker) on the bench and not bringing them on when goalless after 89 minutes. Let alone at the expense of a holding midfielder. Just seemed bizarre.

8146~~~
LVG is seemingly a bit crap at making subs, no arguments from me there... but I've no problem with Falcao not coming on. It's not like he screams "I'm going to score the winner" at the moment.

8147~~~
True but I think Falcao is more likely to get us or create us a goal than Carrick.

8148~~~
No, but why have him on the bench then? Is bringing on Carrick going to prove anything? He's a striker who comes to life in the box (well used to) and I'm sure he still has some of that scoring instinct left.

We draw 0-0 then this is obviously a bigger talking point, yet people will ignore it.

8149~~~
We didn't need an extra striker on the pitch,we needed a creative midfield

8150~~~
Don't know - probably just in case Rooney got injured. 

As for the striker instinct... I'm not so sure!

8151~~~
In the 87th minute bringing on Carrick instead of a striker was us chasing the game?

8152~~~
This. LvG got all decisions right tonight.

8153~~~
who would you have taken off?

8154~~~
Carrick came on for Rojo because he was in danger of getting sent off. He just switched Blind to LB and Carrick to midfield.

Bringing Falcao on would have meant a whole change in formation.

8155~~~
He is also more likely to come on and every time the ball goes near him either mis control it or be bundled off the ball by the defender.

8156~~~
For a start keeping Di Maria on, bringing Fellaini off for Mata or Falcao then do what a team who needs to win does. Bring off a defensive player for an attacking one. Especially when the opposition is so useless.

8157~~~
For 7 minutes. I suppose all the years Fergie brought on attacking players when we need a win are forgotten about. Amazing what a lucky win does for some people.

8158~~~
He fecked it up by taking Di Maria off, so there was really nothing he could have done at that point

8159~~~
If RVP is out for a while then we could do with Falcao as an option. I hope he plays versus Arsenal and shows us something good.

8160~~~
Bringing on Falcao would have achieved nothing at all. He's been wank all season and needs a tap in to score which he wasn't going to get with our service. That said, the Carrick sub made no sense.

8161~~~
A penny for his thoughts tonight. The first half saw so many opportunities in what was a frantic and pretty careless match from both teams defensively. He, and many watching, would have fancied him to have got at least 1 goal from the first half alone.

Then as the second half ticked its way to a conclusion, the signs of him not appearing or even warming up looked damning.

I still hope he can be given a(nother) chance with a team built around a style the compliments him and to serve up chances like we saw in the first half but if you were shaking a magic 8 ball it would read "Don't count on it".

8162~~~
Forgotten Everton? Villa and Stoke? He has won us points with his goals, the first one mentioned being 3 very valuable ones coming off the bench.

However, looking at your posts in this thread after every game, it is clear that whatever Falcao does from now till the end of the season, be it good or bad, you will still point to his bad times. If you believe putting Carrick on for Rojo when we are looking for the win is a better move than trying to bring on more attacking players, then so be it.

8163~~~
Forgotten all the other matches? Where he just squandered goalscoring chances or lost the ball every time it came near him, he's done far more bad than good. Just awful.

8164~~~
He brought Carrick on instead because he needed to move Blind to LB as Rojo was one tackle away from getting a second yellow.

8165~~~
Also his surprisingly brilliant first touch I'd say won us the tie on saturday, considering y'know it drew a red card and gave us a penalty. Lets forget that though.

8166~~~
Lol, it baffles me how people are trying to glorify his past performances and act like we have forgotten how "brilliant" he was, one good turn against sunderland in a game where he was terrible and fans are trying to justify his performances again

8167~~~
Right decision to leave him out, should have been dropped a long time ago. Also, the right decision to not bring him on. Would he have tracked down those defenders like Rooney did for the goal? Doubt it.

8168~~~
Does that one good touch weigh more than all the other atrocious ones I wonder? He has done so many things wrongly in the past months, just a handful of good actions, jt's very optimostic to think that Falcao would change the game positively. Vs Sunderland apart from the pen, he did nothing good/special.

8169~~~
I think it's called delusion.

8170~~~
One good touch. People mentioning one good touch vs Sunderland. My god.

8171~~~
I reckon we should snap him up for £40m so he can provide that one good touch against a bottom 10 team.

8172~~~
And it's oh so baffling to see the same supporters come in after every game to spend their time bashing our players; it's as if they want players to fail so they can have a moan. 

I never used the word brilliant; I never have tried to seriously glorify his season's performance. I am merely trying to give him some credit for what he has given in an otherwise poor season. 

But do continue to think he's done absolutely nothing in his time. I wish more players could play as bad as he can yet provide 9 goals and assists in that time.

8173~~~
That touch was his one moment of absolute World class skill (which we expected to see in virtually every game), he has shown in half a season during which he has played for us.
And once, is not good enough.
If you need a goal, the last player I'd put on the pitch is Falcao. I'd much rather tell Smalling to go up front than Falcao.

8174~~~
I don't single out these players to bash them, i actually wanted Falcao and Di Maria to perform well this season, i mean 2 former World Class players playing for United, who would have thought? it just so happens that both players have been underwhelming and i am not talking about the "new league hard to adjust type" i mean really really bad (taking their standards into account), i have bashed and praised Januzaj this season, same with Blind,Rooney,RVP,Mata,Rojo,Smalling etc. After every game i tend to comment on a lot of players threads, some times good, some times bad - which is perfectly normal since i am a die-hard fan, Falcao hasn't warranted a good comment in a long time, not trying to say he hasn't done anything good in a game, just saying that his overall performances in games have been terrible.

8175~~~
No point mate, people's glass on here is always half empty or maybe that's just football. Falcao gets a bashing even when he's not on the pitch about what he 'wouldn't have done'. Can someone give me the winning numbers for this weeks lottery too?

I'm not saying he's been good but who has this season bar the Keeper. Lets have some perspective, because the same people where bashing Young and Felliani and those players have improved since last season. Equally the same people were bashing DDG, and look whats happened since he's settled after a season. RVP hit the ground running cause he's been playing in this league for 10 seasons anyway.

Falcao is (or was) a good player. Its not like he's walked into the 99 or 08 side. This team has been struggling all season. Its constantly changing formations and personnel as LVG tries to find the right balance. 

Its not like he's walked into that Chelsea team either like Costa. One season is too early to make a judgement. The main issue for me is he appears over his injury. No one can argue he appears to be trying. He's like by his peers (so I've read). LVG has said it takes a season for all the players to settle and I suspect that includes him. Like I said this, this is the same for any new player to the league, maybe with the exception of Costa but look at the players around him.

Patience and we might have a decent player for a couple of seasons......

8176~~~
Aye, but do we want to pay 43m for a "decent" player? He'll be 30 next season, so I'd rather see us spending that money on a younger and more mobile striker.

8177~~~
Not sure tbh cause it depends who this younger player is. Any in mind? Danny Welbeck was younger and more mobile and we didn't like him either on here, and he was one of our own? Didnt cost us a bean.....No patience shown there also.

Sorry, he's crap too....but good enough for Arsenal? Sorry, their crap too....but above us and playing 10000% better football.

8178~~~
No, that's for the manager. I just don't think Falcao is worth 43m - and I had his back up until after Christmas.

8179~~~
One point above us and Welbeck hasnt exactly been brilliant or sthing for them, 10000% better football is a bit of exaggeration too. 

Paying 40 mil for a 30 mil player who will maybe settle next year and maybe come out good. Not a good business.. comparisons with DDG - well DDG was a lot younger when he came and didnt have a big injury a season before.

8180~~~
Wilson for the wages we pay him and fee we'd have to pay for him right now it's a definite stay clear. He's been brilliant and may capture that form again but that's a big if! For the money we'd commit we should not be looking at mediocrity and that's what we have had from Falcao. His age comes into it as well if he was 23-25 then that would go in his favour but he's nearly 30! Oh and I can tell you the lottery numbers will be 6 from number 1 to 49 . Hope that helps (remember my advice comes with a fee should that help you win big)

8181~~~
I'm impatient because I don't want the club to spend 43m on a 29 year old player who hasn't lived up to his reputation? The team you are talking about is one point ahead of us and the player in question has hardly been pulling up any trees at his new club..

8182~~~
They'll mark "<i>had a great first touch against Sunderland" </i>on his gravestone.

I'm kidding, of course, but leaving Falcao on the bench was the right thing to do last night. Given current form we're more likely to benefit from Carrick's arrival than Falcao's.

Rooney had been begging for a ball over the top all second half. Carrick has that kind of pass in his locker. In all liklihood, Falcao would have stumbled about a bit, contributing very little, as par the course.

8183~~~
Easy to say but harder to substantiate. Nope not worth 43m but we've got a 40m player that's a squad player it seems and a 60m player that's done nothing for most of the season. 

One point might be enough at the end of the season. Isn't that the same for every signing 'maybe' irrespective of what you pay? 
Wasn't talking about DDG age or injuries, still needed a year to settle not recover..... 

Sorry, Arsenals football is a million times better than this crap at the moment. Not pulling up trees but he's been injured and I'd have him back tmw....

It's amazing. All of these issues were there before he kicked a play. It's always a 'if' when signing players. Welbeck fitted the profile but we weren't happy with him. I'm not sure why a club would invest 9m in wages on a player that came injured. Help his substantive club with his rehab, ease him back into football only to not signing him? What? I'm not sure what we expected from him. Maybe it's me but please someone give me an indicator of the average recovery / rehab from such an injury......

As above.

8184~~~
He has been injured few games, on the bench few games, in the games he played he hasnt been pulling up trees, he hasnt been anything special. 

Arsenal fooball is better but not 'million times' but lest agree to disagree. 

As for Falcao, we expected him to score goals. He didnt come injured, he came recovered but it seems injury damaged him and he's not his oldself.

8185~~~
With our luck, we will decline his deal, he will sign with another EPL club and be back to a productive player.  It usually takes a full year to recover from a serious injury like a torn ACL.  Especially when your position requires you to have a good movement.

8186~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

How far the mighty have fallen.

8187~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

8188~~~
Don't be ridiculous. It was two good touches.

8189~~~
It's a difficult one with him atm, part of me thinks we should just send him back now, he must know himself that he isn't staying so he's hardly going to be the most motivated, and could be more of a hindrance than a help, but then again he knows he's in the 'shop window' so that could just spark into life, it's difficult to know if it would motivate him or not.

8190~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8191~~~
long debate short, for the money he'll cost he needs to be a star player for us.
And he's shown nothing near that in 3/4 of a season.

Slowly but surely, by pure luck, we've ended with Rooney up front, which we probably should have trialled ages back

8192~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8193~~~
The bit of play that led to the penalty and red card pretty much turned the tie in our favour after we looked clueless for the rest of the game. Don't see what's funny about that, and regardless of how disappointing he's been that turned the match on it's head. Much like any piece of brilliance you see from top players, it can turn a game on it's head. Shame it's one of few things he's done but nobody else has managed it recently. If someone can get all the praise for chasing down a ball then Falcao deserves the praise for turning saturday game massively in our favour. Like I say; he's been a huge let down but Saturdays win was down to his piece of brilliant play.

8194~~~
Don't see where anybody is saying that we should sign him. Doesn't mean he shouldn't get praised for something that he does which helped us win.

8195~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 'Trialled', as if Rooney <i>wasn't a striker</i> when the season began.

Don't get me wrong, I totally agree with the overall point of your post. I just think it's funny how Van Gaal's bizarre decisions have begun to creep into people's minds as the norm!

He's a master hypnotist that man.

8196~~~
This had me in stitches.
Falcao fans really are clutching at straws.
A player does not become a £40M+ player because he had a good touch against Sunderland and scored 4 goals in half a season. For comparison, Aguero and Costa are on 17 goals.
I wouldnt even take this guy if he was offered for £10M - he just isnt good enough to play for Man Utd.

8197~~~
There is probably still a quality player in there somewhere but it's just way too risky to pay £43million and £1million a month in wages for what he's shown.

8198~~~
Since he messed up his windows of opportunity, I would say it's a lot safer for the good of the team (as a group) that Falcao gets the door slammed at him. There's no use in trying again and then risk worse attitude problems contaminating other players. After all, SAF slammed that very same door upon Roy Keane, who was captain at the time.

Considering that LVG didn't even look towards Falcao yesterday, it is loud enough of a message that time is up.

8199~~~
Even if he scored 20 this year, watching Van Persie's decline you have to question paying £43m + wages for a 29 year old. With his injuries, even if this isn't his decline but a lack of confidence or lack of service, how soon until the actual decline anyway? 

Time to invest in a (couple) of young strikers. Rooney, Willo + 2

8200~~~
Agreed. The reality is you could probably pick up both Lacazette and Dybala for the same wages and transfer fee that we're supposedly spending on Falcao alone. Both of whom are younger, faster and have scored more goals this season than Falcao.

8201~~~
To be fair, there's not many top flight strikers to whom that <i>doesn't</i> apply!

8202~~~
Honestly wouldn't start him for the rest of the season, he has brought nothing to the team. 

I am sympathetic though, not as if we've given him much to work with.

8203~~~
Absolutely. Starting to think that perhaps one of our biggest flaws this season has been lack of pace up front... not to turn this into a Welbeck thread or anything. ... But...

8204~~~
Welbeck has great pace and can press very well, but I'd like a striker that can actually finish chances - which he consistently proved he could not do.

8205~~~
Lol

8206~~~
If we can, we should get rid now. He looks like an old man out there.

Clearly he has not been able to recover from the injuries.

8207~~~
If we can get rid of him and RVP in the summer. And sign a younger striker with pace then it would be great business. Especially as we'd also save almost £2m in wages per month from the above two.

8208~~~
He has been NOTHING to feed on, and thus offered not a great deal.

Our other strikers are the same

8209~~~
That doesn't excuse his poor touches. Or his lack of movement.

And please don't pin that on LVG. Rooney in two games has shown a willingness to run in behind more than Falcao or RVP ever have this season.

8210~~~
Yeah agreed, But I have no idea about any young and upcoming strikers that look set to become word class. Harry Kane is pretty much the only one who's caught my eye at the moment, but that twat Levy thinks Spurs are a big club so I doubt he will entertain an offer.

8211~~~
You need to look outside the premier league. Dybala, vietto, lacazette, Depay are all young players we could sign for less then falcao, and would arguably be better. Falcao may have a 2nd wind but I fear injury has shortened his career dramatically.

8212~~~
I think Falcao has done exactly what should have been expected of him. He's never been Messi, Aguero or Ronaldo where he'll create something out of nothing but he works hard, has great movement & he's great at getting on the end of crosses.
I don't know what people expected from him.

8213~~~
You're doing 'peak' Falcao a massive disservice there. He might not have been Messi or Ronaldo, but he was a top top striker.

The player we are now seeing is a shadow of the once great player he was.

8214~~~
Obviously the injury does him no favours but it's hard to judge a striker playing in a system built specifically for him compared to a striker being crowbarred into a system that we're not even sure of.
He may have massively declined as a player, he may not. He's not a kid & he doesn't have to prove himself. Teams should build a team to suit him or don't sign him.
He'll sign for Real in the summer & smash a load of goals next season. Mark my words.

8215~~~
Words marked. Who on earth is he going to displace at Madrid? He's certainly no shiny new toy either.

8216~~~
A system should have no effect on a players touch, finishing and physical condition. All of which have been poor. Its just more excuses.

As for your Madrid theory, why would they want him now when they didn't even want him in the Summer just gone?

8217~~~
Steady on there partner. He did have one good touch against Sunderland <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>
Sorry...couldnt resist.

His movement has been very poor. I remember, in particular against Cambridge, where our attacking players (Falcao and RVP were equally guilty) appeared to be hiding behind Cambridge players to avoid being given the ball. Either that or they just weren't good enough to shake off league 2 defenders.

Falcao certainly isnt good enough to play for a top 4 EPL club.
And I am having genuine doubts if he is good enough to play for any EPL club. His lack of pace, poor movement, poor touch and poor finishing just isnt good enough for the EPL.

And for those saying that he would score many goals for Madrid: <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8218~~~
He could bag in some tap ins.

8219~~~
The way he is playing right now, I don't think he could get into a position (on the pitch), to score a tap-in.
Remember, he struggled against a league 2 defence. This is fact.
If he scored tap-ins for us, I'd be more than happy. Tap-ins = goals = game wins = league title.
His problem is that he can't score and a striker who can't score is useless.

8220~~~
Yes, It's because of Falcao that we drew at Cambridge. I don't want us to sign him at all but it seems like he's getting blamed for pretty much everything at the moment. We were useless against Cambridge, and useless against Sunderland until Falcao's main (only) contribution won us the game. Don't see why that's so difficult to accept for some people, the same people who praise Rooney for closing down a defender in another frustrating performance. Giving someone else all the credit for the Sunderland win when it was Falcao who changed the game in our favour seems a bit unfair really. We were headed for another boring draw.

8221~~~
Rooney's contribution in Newcastle's was way much better than Falcao's in Sunderland's. He made us more fluid. And his ball retention was few times better as well.

8222~~~
Well it's worth pointing out that Rooney was equally as useless as Falcao against Sunderland until they went down to ten men (courtesy of Falcao) which opened the game up. I'm not claiming anything else really but people dismissing his contribution is silly when the same people are all over another player for doing something similar. 

Wonder if he will play tonight... Probably not

8223~~~
Falcao is the scapegoat all the time when everybody else as been crap .
Lou macari said on ts this morning that de gea won player of the year last year and he will win it again this year !!
That sort of tells you all you need to know really about how good we are at present .

8224~~~
He was essentially here on trial and he hasn't done enough, his performances have been nowhere near good enough and even though he isn't alone he has been one of our worst players and consistently bad.

I doubt he will start more than 3 or 4 games for us between now and the end of the season unless we pick up injuries.

8225~~~
Due to him I have full trust in LVG again, one of the best decisions to bench him imo. Lovely guy but just doesnt fit here, think he'll find another club and remain form.

8226~~~
Happy that LvG has finally given up on him, he had way too many chances before being dropped. Hope there isn't a need to bring him on.

8227~~~
Surely we arent making the deal permanent now..

8228~~~
Well it also says you have a world class goalie.

8229~~~
Indeed

8230~~~
I'd rather have Danny Welbeck back.

8231~~~
I'd rather have a good striker. Pity we barely have 1.

8232~~~
Do we need to move this thread to the Reserves forum soon?  He's in the stiffs tonight.

8233~~~
One player on a higher wage than the entire rest of the U21s put together.

8234~~~
Playing with the U-21's tonight vs Spurs. That's a new low for Radamel.

8235~~~
Yeah just heard he is in the U21s  tonight,I don't even know what to make of that lads. Oh how we could do with him recapture just 75% of his old form til the end of the season.

8236~~~
i don't care how big of a man you are, how big a professional... it has to sting to be in his position and be suiting up for the U21's.

8237~~~
It's painful as s the last few games we could have done with him in the squad,

8238~~~
Let's hope he scores a couple and hopefully get his confidence back.

8239~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
Beyond belief.

8240~~~
I really feel sorry for him and although he doesn't really deserve to be necessarily starting for us at the moment, I have no doubts that if he joins another club next season and remains injury free he will be great again, even if not as great as he used to be.

8241~~~
I am so happy to see LVG finally act like a real manager.

8242~~~
He will get some play time and keeps a football rhythm which is so important for LVG. Don't really see such drama here

8243~~~
So he's his old self but LVG and his system ruined him? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

So what if he's playing for U21. Is he special not do it.

8244~~~
he's not Under 21 for one thing <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

In seriousness though, he hasn't been getting much action, so needs some sort of pressure less run out.

He may well still have a role to play

8245~~~
Has he got bad eyesight ? He was squinting and struggling to see his number held up again when he was subbed off  tonight for the U21s .

8246~~~
Can't help but feel we have Chelsea's Fernando Torres here.

8247~~~
Go for an attacking, bold line up. Get Mata, Herrera, Falcao and Rooney, all starting. Just attack these teams. Going cautious has stifled so many. We need some vibrancy back and I believe the two creative players, Rooney plus the wide players offering an outlet will create chances with energy.That first half was what they are capable of. Don't let philosophy get in the way. We're only getting through this period through our attacking play. Falcao will get chances with those players who work with each other. None of this disjointed crap to try and cover a crack until the transfer window opens. I'd hate for us to miss CL with regret of not trying to attack more. Never thought I'd say that with United. Even Moyes set out to attack. We were just clueless at doing it with him.

8248~~~
If you watched Falcao tonight for the U21s I'm sure you would exclude him out of any sort of line-up.

8249~~~
Doubt it, many are just deluded by him.

8250~~~
Was he bad?

8251~~~
We all wrong.

He'd be on fire for Madrid next season. Shit service innit.

8252~~~
Never!

8253~~~
Cringeworthy.

8254~~~
One of the worst performers in the United side if not the worst.Blocked 2 shots that can be goals as well.

8255~~~
Shame that guy has been banned since!

8256~~~
Tonight he looked like a player playing his 1st game back after a cruciate injury rather than one who's been back for 8 months. He was a yard off most balls that went into the box, let the ball bounce off him on numerous occasions, was outmuscled repeatedly by a 17 year old and when he attempted a dribble in the first half he looked like somebody who had never played football before with each touch taking the ball further and further out of his control

8257~~~
did not watch the game but was he really that bad ?

8258~~~
He was
the first block was going in too

8259~~~
Cheers , I feel that is days here are very numbered, I really hope we ship him back to where he came from in the summer.

8260~~~
Fixed.

8261~~~

8262~~~
Plenty of pictures of him wearing fat-ass glasses. Don't know if it's a fashion thing but it wouldn't surprise me if he's as blind as a bat. Might even explain a few things...

8263~~~
Jaysus, that was a tough watch. He's a shell of a man.

Did anyone watch him at France? Was he this abject there too? Surely to god we didn't agree to this deal without one of our scouts having a look at him?

8264~~~
He did score some goals there and was good I think. Maybe I'm wrong though.

8265~~~
I did watch him quite a bit for Monaco last season hence why I made those predictions in August, he  didnt look like his Atletico self even before the injury to be fair.

8266~~~
The sooner we realize he's finished the better. Rickie Lambert would do a fecking better job than this guy right now.

8267~~~
I find it really sad when a world class player losses it so badly, he should just hang his boots up and retire.

8268~~~
Informative.

8269~~~
From what I recall, he was fine at Monaco, not as exciting as at Atlético but the team was extremely cautious, and he obviously didn't enjoy that much being there. But he was fine. The injury has ruined him.

8270~~~
Eerily similar to Shevchenko at Chelsea. Genuinely hard to watch at times.

8271~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8272~~~
Scored 11 in 20 for Monaco

8273~~~
Is he wearing Fellaini's boots from last season?

8274~~~
Before or after the latest injury?

8275~~~
Yes very much so , I really wanted him to do well when he came.

8276~~~
Sad really, but that surely puts to bed any ideas of actually starting him in the first XI... or even bringing him off the bench.

8277~~~
That was before the injury in January. He only played for Monaco again in August before moving to United.

He started well at Monaco, even led the French league in goals scored somewhere around October or November, then missed about a month with a small injury, returned, barely played, and got the knee injury.

Not really a season where you can judge him by regular standings. He had essentially three months of good physical form.

8278~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> whoop there it is... Sad thing is how fecking tragic

8279~~~
Every game the commentators seem fixated on Falcao, asking why we're not bringing him off the bench when needing a goal, like they're still viewing him as the old Atletico player, and not the blindingly obvious realisation that this person is not the same guy as he was then.
I find it really annoying whenever they fixate on him during games, former perception vs reality, I choose reality ever time.

8280~~~
I know I'm in the minority but I can still see the old Falcao within him, I truly believe it's down to the way he has been used and the way we are playing.

In regards to favourites before a ball was kicked, Rooney and van Persie were above him in the pecking order and nothing Falcao could ever do would or will change that, ones a captain and ones a mate. That's life though, happens in all sports and teams.

In regards to the way we play though, we just don't give him the chances that a United striker should be getting, it's slow so and easy for a back four to set themselves, no matter what movement comes from the front, if the ball and numbers aren't going forward, chances won't be created.

The other week when he turned and won the penalty, for van Gaal to sub him was probably the weirdest decision this season, there was a chance to play him against a woeful 10 men for 30mins to try and get a goal but he was rewarded with a seat on the bench.

In saying all that, the chances and opportunities he has had, he has been poor but the issue is bigger than those moments in my opinion, it comes down to van Gaal and the way the team provide for the strikers. The amount of times Falcao get a ball pinged to his knees with his back to goal on the halfway line is mind-boggling

8281~~~
He's finished, plus I don't really think LvG likes Falcao or Mendes.

8282~~~
If you were watching tonight and you can still say that......

8283~~~
I watched it did I?

I'm not hiding from the fact he has been poor but the team has been worse and if we played well, he would be the one to gain the most.

8284~~~
I think he is blind, It was a few weeks ago he was getting subbed and he couldn't read if it's his number being hold up or not! It was funny at the time but it does make you wonder if he is....

8285~~~
Lvg moved Rooney to midfield just to play him..

Its true that the service has been very very poor but he has done nothing with the little service he got, we both now that he"s squandered a fair amount of great chances too this season.

Dont get the fuss about that substitute, I think LVG was already planning to take him off for tactical reasons, I would be worried if one turn completely changes his mind and result in him switching another player or even dont let the substiture come on.

I admire your optimism.

8286~~~
And I can still see the little boy in Van persie

8287~~~
He does look skinny now, I'm sure that he used to be a lot more powerful. Being outmuscled by a 17 year old is not encouraging in the slightest.

8288~~~
He has Torres'd.

8289~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8290~~~
It is truly painful to see a player fall from the best striker in world football to a striker who can't score against teenagers.
I would give up sex for year to see the old Falcao here but as it stands we are only seeing 20% if that of the former man.
How just how can he go from making FIFA TOTY a few years back to this? I will give him till the end of the season to prove he's worth keeping but I reckon LVG's decision is made already - get rid.

8291~~~
He was absolutely shite. I dont care anymore. Falcao, even if he gets back to a decent level again in his career, had enough chances. The only logical thing is to end his loan spell. The earlier the better. This vine posted earlier sums him up

8292~~~
Doesn't sound like the U/21 match was a good outing for him then. Sooner this loan is over the better.

8293~~~
Its quite sad..really wanted it to work out for him here, the sexy bastard

8294~~~
Watch him spark into life when he leaves.

8295~~~
Before. At the time we signed him he scored 3 in 5 I believe

8296~~~
As long as he's playing for a side who'll whip crosses into the box in front of him, he'll score goals. Falcao was a phenomenal striker until that cruciate, but that is no longer the career-ending injury it used to be. We've seen Di Maria go from being one of Real's best players to a donkey in the space of a few months. We've seen Rooney, our third-highest goalscorer, stuck in midfield where he's ineffective, and Valencia turned into a full-time full back. The problem is not with Falcao.

8297~~~
Di Maria looks physically fine, he's just made struggled a bit in terms of ball retention in a mediocre footballing side. Nothing too weird.

Falcao is not the man he was, physically. It may come back, or it may not. At 29, with his injury record, you'd bet against it, though if he can split the difference he can at least get back to being a very good 1 in 2 striker. Still not going to be enough to be better than Rooney or Mata as a central attacker.

8298~~~
If you go to Squawka and crunch the numbers, Falcao's conversion of non-penalty shots (including headers) from inside the box is less impressive than Hernandez's. That's true comparing them both out of form and them both in form.

In La Liga 2012/3 Falcao scored 28 goals of which 8 were pens and 2 shots from outside the box. He converted 18 out of 78 non-penalty shots from inside the box. Hernandez in 2012/3 converted 10 out of 37 shots from inside the box. Out of form Falcao has 4 goals from 24 attempts inside the box this season in the PL. Out of form Hernandez scored 4 from 18 attempts inside the box last season in the PL.

The fact that Atletico got a lot of pens and Falcao took them, made him seem far more impressive than his own good but hardly amazing, conversion stats indicate.

At International level Falcao has a phenomenal 21 goals in 54 appearances while Hernandez has a modest 38 in 70 appearances (I don't have the break-down of starts/sub appearances or pens scored. Or indeed opponents faced. They may explain the difference)

Indeed if you go to Youtube and watch the video of all Falcao's goals for Atletico, the vast majority are of the type that Hernandez scored for us; only a handful demonstrate exceptional skill that you wouldn't associate with Chicharito. 

We made the common mistake of assuming someone else's glamorous cow was superior to our own cow, when in reality the difference is negligible.

8299~~~
What a shame for Falcao. We now know why he's on the bench. On this performance, he wouldn't have made a jot of difference if he'd come on in the match with the Arse.

8300~~~
How does a player fall so far?
Is it purely physical after his injuries or is it a mental issue?

Perhaps he needs to pay a visit to Professor Hans Shoegaarten?

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jNERlJLo1no?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

8301~~~
Shite for the U21s as well, Good to hear Rafael had a decent game.

<b>Falcao fails to shine for U21s</b>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-united/9753111/Manchester-United-loan-star-Radamel-Falcao-fails-to-shine-for-reserves" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-...ar-Radamel-Falcao-fails-to-shine-for-reserves</a>

8302~~~
If he can't even cut it for the U21s, then there's not much hope left for his footballing career. Like people said for the last few weeks, you would expect him to give it all in order to get up in the pecking order.

8303~~~
Before the injury

8304~~~
He's finished, poor lad.

8305~~~
The problem is with Falcao. Lots of great crosses whipped into the box last night but he was always a yard behind them, or on his heels, too slow to react. Same stuff we've seen from him all season.

8306~~~
We have a lot of problems but in this story United is not a problem. Falcao is not his old self. Sure he didnt have service, but poor touches, being outmuscled even by teenagers, let alone PL players, not running behind defenses, being late for crosses and passes, and fluffing even the chances he got. thats not on the club.

People mentioning that sub vs sunderland - thats getting ridiculous, lvg has decided to make a sub before the pen and subbed him.. Even if he stayed nothing exceptional would have happened.

8307~~~
These days you just have to be an OShea to make Falcao look good.

8308~~~
<a class="username" data-user="19613, @Orton" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/19613/">@Orton</a> - what did you make of Falcao's showing for the U21's?

8309~~~
He did score one of the most skillful goals I've ever seen for us mind you...

8310~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2xqIEQeW2Lk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

8311~~~
Well that was painful to watch. Really really poor.

8312~~~
He looked really down when coming off the pitch <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

8313~~~
Surely nobody can still be calling for him to start for us in the Prem? He's awful. It's a shame but he's completely lost everything that once made him brilliant.

8314~~~
A lack of confidence is clearly also an issue. I don't think he is anywhere near the player he once was, but he is better than he has shown lately.

8315~~~
When he came back around Christmas he was playing OK. Villa, Newcastle, first half against Spurs, Stoke. And that was coming back from injury and needing game time (although the team as a whole was playing well then). Now his confidence is shot but he can do better than he has been doing. It's funny that the last thing he did on the pitch for the first team was the best thing we've seen from him then he immediately got subbed off, I wish he'd gotten to finish that game.

Confidence is a funny thing, just look at Andy Cole's time at United.

8316~~~
If you can't show even a glipse of that against relegation fodder, League 1 & 2 opposition or in an U-21 match i'd say there's a good chance you've lost it.

8317~~~
I would go as far as saying that he has Shevchenko'd.

8318~~~
I don't like that look on his face, it always seems like he's in pain (even early on in that video).

8319~~~
Man, I feel sorry for him. Then I remember the fact that he makes more in a week than I do over a year.

8320~~~
Well, he's still being paid more in a week than many (any?) of us earn in a year to knock a football around.

Hard for me to feel too sorry for him.

That said, I hope he finds somewhere to enjoy another few seasons of good football - Italy or the MLS is where he should be.

Good luck to the man.

8321~~~
I did, he had much better movement and control in France. However he was already on the decline and not scoring consistently with the chances he had, Ranieri had to partner him with Rivière from Newcastle because Falcao up top alone wasn't working that well. I think the knee injury may have just emphasized a decline in his footballing skills.

Absolutely spot on.

8322~~~
I didn't know we weren't allowed to feel sorry for wealthy people.

8323~~~
I'd be surprised if theres many people on here who earn his week's salary in 5 years let alone one.

8324~~~
Come and step into my yacht...

8325~~~
Can't even score for the U21's good god.

8326~~~
Must be quite hard to motivate yourself for a game against the under 21s. Is it really worth putting all the effort in when it won't make a difference in the grand scheme of things? I doubt it. 

The writing is on the wall for him, after LVG decided against bringing him on at Newcastle or Arsenal when we was chasing the game. It's a shame because i believe if he was used better, he would have recaptured some of that form from Atleti.

8327~~~
I never said people weren't allowed to feel sorry for him. I just personally don't. Not that much anyway. You can see he's trying, but it's just not working out. 

For sentimental reasons, I was disappointed we let go of Cleverley, for example, but he's not exactly pulling up trees in Villa, isn't he? It was a good decision in hindsight, and one I now agree with. Same goes to Anderson, Welbeck or Kagawa, all players I had hoped would eventually come good.

Falcao might do better in another club (another reason why I don't feel that sorry for him, he'll get a chance at another club) but signing him is not a risk I want the club to take.

8328~~~
I think we're better off rid, definitely. 

I do think there is something tragic about watching a once great sportsman coming to terms with the fact that his powers are fading prematurely. I'm sure that hurts deeply and his salary won't take that pain away. I feel sorry for him.

8329~~~
Yeah exactly. Which is why I said, I feel sorry for him. Then I remember his salary, and how he's set up for life. If his outlook on life is anything like mine, 10-20 years down the road, I reckon he'll do well to look at his time at United and go, "Oh well, can't say I've tried. Certain things just conspired against me during my time there."

My post was actually a train of my thoughts, rather than any snidey sarcastic remark. Although reading it back now, I can see why it can be misconstrued! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8330~~~
Ok, that wasn't a horror show as most are suggesting on here. He had a few of awkward moments but on the whole I thought he was OK.

8331~~~
To be fair, the snidey sarcastic remark came from me. Sorry about that.

But yeah, pitying multimillionaires is weird. I can't help it though. Probably mainly fuelled by my own (incredibly shit) football career coming to an end recently due to my own ACL falling to bits.

8332~~~
Could be worse. You could realise you're 30 next year and you haven't played a competitive game in over 10 years due to work commitments. Best years gone without a ball kicked.

8333~~~
A member of the ruined ACL club. Condolences to you. I lost two years of football I can never get back thanks to mine. I still remember how small my right thigh (where they took the muscle to rebuild my ACL from) was compared to my left. Also, how I kicked a ball like a wimp my first few weeks back playing Sunday league football.

Oh, and no worries about the remark. No offence taken.

8334~~~
Probably useless. Didn't watch it.

8335~~~
It is because we wrongly assume money means happiness and realization. Thing is millionaires are used to their own income, they replace their need to make ends meet for other goals and have their own challenges and frustrations. Empathy and putting yourself in someone else's shoes should allow you to feel pity for anyone going through a rough patch regardless of income.

Falcao finally reached the top-top tier, after wandering near it for very long and is failing miserably. He seems like a good bloke. Seems like a pity worthy situation to me. I doubt he's happy.

PS: Quoted you for context, not to disagree. I assume from your other posts you agree with most of what I said.

8336~~~
At the 1:34 mark in that video, he was one on one with a CB and he failed to do anything with the ball. His confidence is completely gone. I had high hopes for this guy. <a class="username" data-user="42612, @Arruda" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/42612/">@Arruda</a> great post

8337~~~
Is it just me or in the close up shots where he's just walking is he limping?

Is his knee that fecked that he just limps all the time?

Mind you, RVP often looks the same when he's walking around after he's just had a run or something.

8338~~~
To be fair to Falcao, he is a brilliant professional. Always giving his all and I still see him posting on Twitter about encouraging United tweets. Not many world stars would celebrate a reserve goal like he did last night especially when he is not the one scoring.

8339~~~
Did he used to stumble around and bullied by defenders in his peak days as easily he was now? Pace probably yes, but i cannot believe the basics of football like holding up play will all magically disappear even after a serious cruciate injury

8340~~~
Could he not try playing against an U18 side? Or maybe U16?
He needs to get his confidence up a little bit and if he could dominate other players around him - this could help.

In any case, he isnt good enough to play in the premier league and he appears to be getting worse by the day.

I honestly dont understand why people are making excuses for him. The guy is struggling against teenagers - what will happen when he plays against grown men?

8341~~~
Glad that we didn't sign him

8342~~~
Maybe his confidence is shot because he is worried about not being offered a permanent deal?  If we had just signed him on a full time bases in the summer I wonder if his contribution would have been more this season. We should start him against Tottenham in my opinion give him a run of games and actually give him some service. I feel he deserves one last attempt at a permanent deal.

8343~~~
So we should sign him permanently to make him play better? I reckon we should pay him extra too. He needs the confidence.

8344~~~
I like him personally and  his highlight reel is amazing but he is not the striker we need.
He should go to Spain to reinvigorate his career like Forlan.

The last thing MUFC needs is LVG trying to shoehorn him (or RVP) into our lineup when it is clear Rooney is the better ST. We need top 4 and this isnt the time to feck around.

8345~~~
I was stating that this could be the a big factor in his confidence being down. The more time goes on, the more it looks like he's leaving. I thought he'd get the chance when RVP was confirmed as a lengthy lay-off. But this has not occurred. I wish him luck if he does not stay but we should utilise him while we are paying his wages.

8346~~~
I agree with you, however the last few games have been crying out for a player of his ilk to come off the bench and make the difference. At the moment we are paying him to sit on the bench and play in the under 21's. Its a real shame.

8347~~~
Yeah, stuff like that makes me feel all the more sorry for him. His attitude seems excellent. Would be a huge fan favourite if he was at his best. The whole thing is just a terrible shame. 

Sometimes I agree with <a class="username" data-user="23783, @Adebesi" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/23783/">@Adebesi</a>'s theory that the whole post-Fergie era is just karmic retribution for so much success. 

We seem to be doomed to endure a whole lot of needless painful shit in addition to the team simply being less succesful. From watching Pogba slowly develop into one of the best players in the world, to getting knocked out of the FA Cup by own of our own, to megastars like Falcao and Di Maria being crushing dissapointments. No doubt our soon to be best keeper since Shmeicel (possibly ever) will be off in the summer an' all. We're all just part of some cosmic joke. Suck it, bitches.

8348~~~
He falls down, a lot.

8349~~~
He has been so bad I think LVG is justified in leaving him on the bench nd rather than crying out for him I think the opposite is true, last thing we need is someone who can't contribute as we Re struggling enough already.

You can't fault him for effort, even in the reserve game he tried his best and wanted to stay on but that makes it even more worrying when he plays so badly because he is trying so hard but his body just isn't up to it anymore and maybe it never will be again. It is a real shame because he was genuinely a top class player but on current form he shouldn't be anywhere near the starting eleven and isn't even a good option coming off the bench.

8350~~~
Can't be more true.Yes he did try his best but with his current condition even sitting on the bench is a bit underserving and mainly because he's Ramadel Falcao plus our lack of strikers available.

8351~~~
Felt sorry for him that entire video of his game against the u21's. Like he's realizing how much the injury took out of him that he can't do much at that level. Feel like he looked more fit and quicker and generally a lot better at the start of the season too then he does now. Seems like such a nice guy too, never complains publically, just gets on with it, works hard... Just isn't working out. Hopefully he gets back to a good level somewhere after this loan spell.

8352~~~
Yeah I hope he goes elsewhere (outside England) and starts to fire again. I really feel for him but we're in too deep shit to rehab him any better. 

Oh, what could have been if his volley against Leicester went in... <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Not just for him, but for us as a team as well.

8353~~~
I still think we let Hargreaves go too soon, surely if we offered him a new contract he'd contribute more?

Falcao is a nice guy but he's fecking done and has looked every inch of it since he first put on a United shirt.

8354~~~

8355~~~
More like we loaned the wrong player.

8356~~~
This. Believe it or not, but even though footballers get paid obscene amounts of money they still love playing football at the big stage. Being one of the the worlds top athlethes and then being reduced to a nobody by injury must be difficult. 

At this point, i would say the only sensible thing would be to keep him if we got him for free. Except a couple of moments of (near) brilliance he has been sub-par the whole season.

8357~~~
Just to save anyone else gving that awful fecking rag some clicks, the article is all speculation, no quotes at all.

8358~~~
Why would he admit openly that he joined the wrong team.

8359~~~
He didn't.

8360~~~
I accepted he joined the wrong team. But the Daily Mail editor didn't think that was a particularly strong story.

8361~~~
Absolutely. Is this the same Ian Ladyman who some regard as a quality journalist? An article of pure guesswork. He may be right but it's guesswork nevertheless.

8362~~~
As a journalist, people have far too healthy an obsession with quotes in articles.

8363~~~
Such an article needs quotes, to be fair.

8364~~~
He should have gone to a smaller club were pressure is lower and he is guaranteed regular first team football. However I doubt those teams could afford his salary.

The guardians rumour mill did make me chuckle today:

he Mill has never been to Cheltenham. There, we’ve said it. That’s not to say we haven’t been to the races – this Sisyphean existence of tittle-tattle propagation shows you how well that financial venture worked out – but the Cotswolds, lovely as they may be, lie far outside our experiential range. So, being a kind soul beneath it all, we feel at one with <b>Radamel Falcao</b>, who did not join Daley Blind, Ashley Young, Jonny Evans and Phil Jones in cheering on the horses yesterday and therefore provided further evidence that he’s … you’re going to like this … not at the races! The guy’s lost it. Gone. Finished. If proof were needed, this is the proof.

In Falcao’s defence, he has already been to Yeovil, Cambridge and Preston this season so his knowledge of the provinces looks laudably sound for a Colombian who only moved to the country in September. But, as we all know, when footballers are not touring the regions they are locked in tense, nerve-racking talks in windowless, halogen-lighted rooms, concerning themselves with the future. And Falcao, so multiple stories would have it, has accepted after much brow-furrowing that his own destiny lies away from Old Trafford and knows that –<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/10/radamel-falcao-manchester-united-under-21s-tottenham" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">having been selected for their Under-21 side on Tuesday night</a> – he has no long-term future at Manchester United. And boy, with that empty padded seat in Gloucestershire sticking out like a sore thumb, doesn’t he know how to show it. Of most concern, surely, is the fact that those queuing up to make hilarious, wry, self-fulfilling comments about the form and apparent decline of a striker who has recovered from a serious injury, been pitched into the world’s most demanding league and asked to perform for a side going through the most tortuous of revamps, only have a couple of months left to do so. Knock yourselves out.

8366~~~
A team that struggles so much to create chances was probably not the greatest place for a striker who's recovered from a long injury to get his mojo back. I'm not so certain he's 'done' and he could prosper elsewhere, who knows.

8367~~~
Off the record sources are so painfully prevalent in sports reporting that it makes it nigh on impossible to give direct quotations each and every time. Unattributed quotes do not provide a direct link to accuracy.

8368~~~
Its quite possible to have a considerably better informed and more authoritative article without quotes than one with. Id rather read an article from a respected journalist who had been briefed off the record by someone who knew what he was talking about, than a load of speculative mumbo jumbo backed up by a few meaningless platitudes from footballers or managers who are essentially trying to give as little away as possible, if not outright lie ("he isnt going anywhere" or "there has been no contact with the club" a few days before a deal is officially announced.)

Im far more interested in the identity of the journalist and the publication than the presence of quotes. If you have a journalist with a good track record they probably have well placed sources in a club who will be far more candid if their name is kept out of the story.

8369~~~
This is true. Apparently "sources close to" is the widely accepted shorthand for using a quote that a player has asked to be off the record.

Still, this particular article is neither authoritative or insghtful. Stating the bleeding obvious too. He's not very happy about being dropped and playing (badly) for our reserves instead. Well gee, that's a surprise.

8370~~~
A healthy obsession??

8371~~~
The mood of the article, though, is that Falcao won't be 'going gracefully' and could well '<i>do a Hargreaves'</i> in terms of how he paints the club upon leaving...

Could be complete nonsense, but if this is correct, I wonder how that will sit with the 'whadda bloody thoroughly nice bloke' set who decided that Falcao was 'an amazing guy' upon his arrival...?

8372~~~
The man was a crock . At the beginning of every year he had a recurring knee problem . If you meant contribute to the physio room, then yes.

8373~~~
Unhealthy, sorry! Definitely not healthy...

8374~~~
How about leaving the character assassination until, you know, it's actually deserved?

8375~~~
You are an unbelievable poster at times. Wowzalinha, could not agree more.

8376~~~
Yeah that sounds fair. Empathetic but balanced, rather than the overly emotional nonsense some are posting as if his actual career is over or something - it isn't. He's going to continue as a professional footballer playing at a high level.

I do feel for him, and as I've said continuously throughout the thread, I truly hope he gets a good couple of years somewhere else - Italy or the MLS would both be a great shout for him.

I'll certainly be glad to have him off our wage bill though, he's contributed absolutely nothing and been paid super-star wages to do so.

Hopefully his next move is thought through a little more carefully and realistically by himself and Mendes, because he really needs to end up somewhere where he can contribute with the attributes at his disposal.

A slower, less frenetic league where he gets that split second longer on the ball is what he needs.

Good luck to him.

8377~~~

8378~~~
By solution does he mean excuse?

8379~~~
He's being diplomatic. He's a good guy who needs to find a club next year and he clearly finds the pace and power of the league difficult, especially with his decline. 

There would be no need to hang him out to dry by saying he's finished as a player.

8380~~~
He isn't going to throw him under the bus now is he?

8381~~~
Errrrrrr <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8382~~~

8383~~~
You can tell that LVG hasn't said a word to the people that wrote those programme notes.

8384~~~
I still feel he is going to have a big moment for us. Something that fans will remember, feel like it will be a winner against City or Liverpool and it could be vital moment.

8385~~~
I believe his big moment was against Sunderland (that touch). <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>
I must admit, when he did that, I stood up in excitement as that was the first time I saw him do something that perhaps only one of the World's best striker can do. In that moment, he was unplayable.
The problem is that the next time he took to the pitch (in the U21 game), he was bad and was subbed off. So, that touch, didnt mark the beginning of anything special.

Unfortunately for Falcao, the more he plays, the more he proves that he is past it, which will affect his chances of moving to a decent club. So, for his own sake, it might be best not to play him.

8386~~~
Oh dear, i fear this lad might not tweet again

8387~~~
Had energy when he came on, can't really say much more as he didn't get a chance to do a lot.

8388~~~
Signing him on a permanent deal for the money talked about would be more stupid than waiting for Fellaini's buyout clause to expire and paying more.

8389~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.itv.com/news/2015-03-20/radamel-falcao-often-cries-down-the-phone-over-man-utd-career-former-agent-reveals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.itv.com/news/2015-03-20/...one-over-man-utd-career-former-agent-reveals/</a>

I know he hasn't produced much this season for us, but you have to feel for the guy.

But it's pretty harsh from this former agent for telling this to the press. Feel like this sort of thing should be kept private.

8390~~~
It would be fantastic if he came off the bench on Sunday to score a 90th minute winner. The confidence will sky rocket I'm sure.

8391~~~
Definitely, it's not happening.

8392~~~
He says he doesn't know how to deal with the situation but it's pretty simple, play excellent in the second team, train to the best of your ability. This is a chance for him to get even better, direct that emotion to excellent training, unleash that hunger for goals.

If he performs for the second team he might get another chance but even then, if we are chasing a goal there is a good chance he will be subbed on especially if we are creating chances and also I would back him to get on the end of one of those.

He has had a horrible injury but his career is far from over, he does need to work hard to find that form but there is no reason a player of his ability can't be a star again. Even if he has lost a yard of pace, he seems to be an intelligent man, he just needs to adapt his game. In the box he is lethal, capable of scoring so many different types of goals, in an attacking team that has players to create a lot of chances he will probably be fine.

He has been in a side this season not creating chances but even moreso he has been asked to play as a creative striker, Louis van Gaal has said he likes strikers to also create chances and has referred to Falcao as one of his creative players but it's not really his game.

To put into context how good this guy was, he scored for Atletico in 2012 - 13 in La Liga 6 less goals than Ronaldo in the same amount of games but that season Atletico scored only 65 goals, Real Madrid scored 103, had Falcao been in a side creating chances like Real Madrid he would have got a lot more goals. He can still bounce back, I'm not sure what team will take him next season but I am sure he'll do well wherever he ends up.

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Radamel Falcao driven to tears by Manchester United woes, claims friend</b></span>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/20/radamel-falcao-tears-manchester-united-louis-van-gaal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.theguardian.com/football...falcao-tears-manchester-united-louis-van-gaal</a>

8394~~~
They angle it as if it's United's fault he's completely past it. I'd have sympathy if he didn't look like the worst player on the pitch during that reserve game. As it is it suggests he's either shite now or not prepared to prove his sharpness at reserve level. Either way it's not United's fault. It's a competitive industry and there's no room for passengers, even if they are costing you a fortune. 

We don't owe him anything at the end of the day. He's failing an audition that is earning him and costing United about £10m.

8395~~~
So if he cried before the game, imagine what he mustve been like after he got subbed off for being a liability? He mustve hit rock bottom.
He desperately needs to play in an easier league, to rebuild his confidence.
He just isnt good enough to play in the EPL. Ive said this many times, but playing with him in the team is like playing with 10 men.

8396~~~
Agreed. I was so glad when we got him. Shame it became such an disappointing episode. If he performed like he did for A.Madrid and Porto we'd be in a much healthier shape.

8397~~~
The story is so  obviously planted its ridiculous. Compare his attitude to Fellaini/Young/De Gea, all of whom were absolutely slaughtered by the press and fans but we never heard news stories about them crying.

8398~~~
It's time like this right now why I miss fergie. He'd know exactly what to do and say to him to get him to pull his head in and get on with it. To me falcao on that evidence does not have the mentality to be a Manchester United player.  You don't like it, get fecking stuck in and prove you're better than you are showing.

8399~~~
Agent is only worried about Brand Falcao and how his he going to move him on after a not so successful spell at Umited.

8400~~~
That's not his agent talking.

8401~~~
Ok. Never read the article.But having read it i don't have any sympathy for him.

8402~~~
Putting him into reserves seems odd to me. I can understand it as a method to motivate/punish player if he's not doing enough, but Falcao has always been very committed. He just isn't good enough anymore, I think it's quite simple. Don't know how playing for the reserves can help him, and it's not like we don't have strikers there so it's weird.

8403~~~
He only played 1 game.That was for him to regain match fit with him not playing in the past few weeks.

8404~~~
Don't think one game for the reserves in a few weeks time makes much of a difference for his fitness.

8405~~~
It's better than nothing

8406~~~
I do have sympathy for him. His slump is not through not trying. He's clearly giving everything when he plays. He works hard, often gets into the right positions but he just looks shot to pieces in both confidence and sharpness. I'm sure a lot of players have become very upset over spells of poor form and being slaughtered by the media. Falcao wont be the first. I'm sure De Gea and Fellaini (amongst others) found it hard as well. 

It's just a shame it didn't work out for him here, but I don't really think it's Falcao's fault that his friend has sold this story to the tabloids.

8407~~~
Maybe you're right but it does more harm for his confidence than good for his fitness IMO.

8408~~~
He was probably played in the U21 game for 3 reasons:
1. to give him some match fitness (physical and mental)
2. to give him confidence - if he is scores 2-3 goals in the reserves, then he will feel better about himself. Confidence is so important for strikers (Unless your name is Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who always brims with confidence).
3. if he performs well, he gives LVG cause to consider him for starting in the first team

The problem was that he was so bad in that reserve game, he got subbed off and this dented his confidence.
But, for us, this is good for 2 reasons:
1. we know that he isnt good enough, even to play with youth players
2. LVG now knows for certain that this guy is not effective in the EPL

I've said this for a while now and that is that Falcao is now destroying his own career by staying in the EPL. Its like watching a car crash in slow motion.
With every game he plays, he demonstrates how bad he is, which puts off potential employers.
He needs to go to a lesser league, disappear off the radar for a year or so and use this time to regain his form, away from the lime-light. If by this time he can regain his form (he will be 30 years old), he can ask for his final transfer to a big club.

8409~~~
Yeah, I pretty much agree with that. He's got to take a step down for his own sake.

8410~~~
I should feel sorry for him but I don't. Crying over this situation is something I cannot understand. Just like I don't understand how supposedly a friend of his decides to air all of this in public, this is going to hurt him even more. What a cnutish move that was (if it's all true of course).

8411~~~
As it stands it's just falcaos reps trying to blame everybody else other than the player himself so to keep alive a big money move elsewhere .
He will probably sign for juventus and be a success in Italy and he's certainly decent enough to bang a few in against the mediocre spanish teams . 
The only concern is his reported 300k a week wages which will prove a stumbling block for would be suitors .
I personally think LVG gave him time to get up to a certain level of fitness before giving him his chance . 
Maybe van persie as been given more preferential treatment but in my opinion falcao as been given more than enough chances and certainly can't complain .
Maybe the system hasn't suited his style but as rooney proves , with a bit of hard work and determination you can play well as a 9 in this set up.
No doubt we will hear all the sob stories when / if he leaves about how he was miss managed but every now and again players should hold there hands up and say they were not good enough .

8412~~~
Perhaps, but a goal or two for the reserves would have done his confidence a power of good. Hope he can resurrect his career but I don't think it will be at Old Trafford.

8413~~~
Agree with all these posts.

But I'm increasingly unsure sure about the 'good enough for Spain or Italy' stance (I myself have suggested a move to Italy is what's best for him since about November...).

After watching him in the reserves and also against league 1 defenders I think maybe the MLS or China might be a better shout for Falcao and his agent.

One things for sure - Van Gaal has given him more than enough opportunity here. He should be grateful.

You could argue (and I would) that the patience shown to Falcao and RvP has actively meant sacrificing about 6 points this season.

8414~~~
What I don't get is that he looked a lot more dangerous when he first came back against Leicester, QPR. He seems to have gotten progressively worse with match practice.

8415~~~
This hit me the other day. I think that mystery injury he had was more serious than first thought and from then on its been a confidence issue.

8416~~~
I thought he did fine in that tense last 10 minutes, was strong enough on the ball when it came to him, showed composure and pressed well.

8417~~~
Thought he did ok as well, although he clearly lacks the Rooney's physicality and pressing ability.

8418~~~
Good thing we're paying 300k/week for that.

I honestly dont see what he brings to our side now. To me Wilson is a better player to bring off the bench as he can at least inject pace and cause trouble for a tiring defence.

These "crying" stories piss me right off. His agent is being an asshole and it's obviously got Falcao's blessing. It's one thing to be useless on the pitch but if he's being a detriment to team harmony, banish him to train on his own at Carrington until May.

8419~~~

Looks like he's about to start crying and suck his thumb

8420~~~
I'm not sure why this is aimed at me, my comments were purely about his ten minutes today, I comment in all our players threads after a game.

8421~~~
Im sorry, it wasnt meant to be aimed at you in any sort of negative way.

8422~~~
The man couldn't control a Playstation.

8423~~~
Looks to have a good relationship with LVG there. He has a really great attitude and work ethic, but sadly we all expected much more than that.

8424~~~
Falcao...love the guy as a person, I think he's on of those footballers whose genuinely pleasant - but...nah..he's off at the end of the season. However..I would just love him to score the goal that secured our fourth place, not sure why...just would be cool.

8425~~~
I have a slight feeling we might sign him. His body language doesn't suggest that he's off.

8426~~~
I would love to see him come on when we are playing the ball forward. Comes on in the last 2 matches when United are just running the game out. Still believe he can do something for us. 

Contrast Rooney's performance today, versus the last 3 games when up front. He was very poor today, but doesn't get the same slagging off as Falcao.

8427~~~
There's a few twists and turns left in this season and Falcao coming good might be one of them. I take all these "crying" stories with a grain of salt. His attitude overall seems to be positive. All he needs is a goal or two and all will be well.

8428~~~
How long have people been saying this?

8429~~~
Me? All season. I like him and really want him to do well.

8430~~~
Not a chance.

8431~~~
I don't see any reason why club would keep him, also don't know why he would even want to stay as he is only ever going to be backup to Rooney so surely he would be better off elsewhere.

8432~~~
He was better than Rooney today I will give him that much....

8433~~~
No chance. 

The sub today was a good call by Louie though.

8434~~~
For what it's worth I don't think we will ever see the true Falcao again but suggesting Wilson play in a game of this magnitude would be ridiculous IMO. Wilson is quick but has hardly set the world on fire with his chances this season, and he has had plenty of them. At least Falcao has experiences of playing in big games.

8435~~~
Rooney was poor today but he has also had some good games recently and we look a much better team with him leading the line, falcao gets criticism because he has played poorly game after game.

There is also a reason why we play more forward passes without falcao on the pitc, he constantly loses the ball, has no pace and just runs round like a headless chicken most of they time. Rooney is leading the line much better and bringing in falcao will only make us worse team.

Cameo appearances off the bench and maybe a goal or two is about all he will bring in the remaining eight games.

8436~~~
We may still sign him but under very different conditions.

Smaller salary with bonuses if he'll somehow return to being THE motherfeckin El Tigre and way smaller fee for Monaco for selling us heavily damaged player after his unfortunate injury.

8437~~~
Have to disagree with you there. The reason is not him, it was because Rooney is in midfield and does not pass forward very often, he goes sideways. The difference in playing Carrick, Mata, Herrera and Young/Di Maria in midfield is very evident.  Not taking anything away from Rooney's recent upfront efforts, but the midfield are looking for him as well.

Falcao has not exactly had loads of game time, and when he played from the start we had the likes of Rooney and Fellani in midfield. I would be interested to see how he performs with these others in midfield.

8438~~~
It was his ex-agent, no? And I wouldn't be so sure it had Falcao's blessing.

8439~~~
When a forward makes no runs, has no pace and constantly loses the ball it also means midfielders play sideways, I have zero interest in seeing falcao start another game for the club, he has plenty of time and done nothing.

8440~~~
To be clear though, I meant I'd rather have Wilson come on as a sub in the same circumstances that Falcao did today.

8441~~~
I had a mancrush on Falcao before we signed him for loan. I was over the top when we made that loan deal, and I've waited for him to blossom all season. At the start of the season, he was new in the league, just back from injury. We won some games, but played awful football. I said to my self - once we play like a team, he will be big for us. Now our team looks well composed, and when Falcao enters the field, he looks like an untuned part in our machinery. He doesn't make the decisions with the ball, he doesn't make the right runs without the ball, and his first touch is worse than Fellanis nightmare-touches last season. He's not worth the wage we're allegedly is paying him, and he's absolutely not worth the transfer fee Monaco allegedly slammed on his beautiful long, black hair.

8442~~~
Doesnt mean you should be deluded.

8443~~~
Anyone see the clip of the players on the bench celebrating Mata's goal? Falcao looked genuinely thrilled. Stuff like that makes me warm to him, even though I know it's in everyone's interest that he leaves in the summer. Such a pity. I reckon he could have been a massive fan favourite if he'd been able to get back anywhere near his best.

8444~~~
He's just terrible. He genuinely can't control a football anymore.

He does try hard though, doesn't shirk responsibility. Which is good to see.

8445~~~
His ball control is awful but I'll praise him for the way he put himself about yesterday. As you can see in the pictures after the game, he seems to have a good relationship with van Gaal and clearly cares about the club even though he's just on loan. Falcao will understand why he's on the bench he'll know better than anyone that he's not playing well and doesn't deserve to start at the moment.

It's good to have him as back up but I wouldn't start him anytime soon and definitely wouldn't sign him on a permanent.

8446~~~
My only expectation when he came on was to see us hold on to that 2-1 lead until the final whistle. This guy actually cause as much damage to his team as any other opponent - and sometimes even more when he gives the ball away in stupid situations.

Good luck to his agent finding a new home for this parody of a man. Has Milan written all over him - or maybe he's gone past that level as well?

8447~~~
There was one time that Rooney got the ball up front by himself, in line with Liverpool's CBs. But he had to look around for a pass just because he couldn't, at least, keep in pace with their CB's, more so to out run them.

It is sad that I think Falcao wouldn't be any different than Rooney in such a similar situation. At least Rooney has more to his game to compensate his lack of pace.

8448~~~
When did he give the ball away in a stupid situation yesterday?

8449~~~
seeing out leads for 15-20 looks to be his role now for the last 8.

Then it's cheerio, sorry it didn't work out.

8450~~~
He'd have to be able to control the ball first, in order to then give it away tbf.

8451~~~
Well, considering he only touched it twice and won a free kick one of those times, he didn't cause much damage then.

8452~~~
That's one way of looking at it. Two touches per 10 minutes is Mario Gomez territory, though, and tells us that Falcao isn't doing enough when he gets on the pitch.

8453~~~
Or it tells you that we sat back and invited pressure most of the 2nd half. In comparison, pretty sure Hernandez had like 3 touches in half an hour in a Madrid game earlier this season. Anyway, the team's mindset was completely different later in the game. Most of them just wanted to see it out.

8454~~~
That's true too.  I wonder why Falcao was put on then, as it is not as if he became an outlet to take off the pressure.

8455~~~
That what I'm saying... make it happen.

8456~~~
Why is this thread not locked yet?

8457~~~
Don't be stupid.

8458~~~
Or at least change the "performances" to "cameos"

8459~~~
I'm no fan of the garbage Falcao has produced here, nor am I a fan of the numb-skulled, borderline Daily Mail reader, '<i>whadda bloody thoroughly awesome guy</i>' angle many posters have bafflingly taken with him, but this is just needless and nasty in my opinion.

I'm sure you didn't mean it, but it has to be pointed out that he's not a 'parody of a man', he's just a footballer who isn't anywhere near equipped to make it at United (or in the PL at all, imo).

There's no need to personally insult him (or praise him, from what I've seen).

8460~~~

8461~~~
Such a shame that he failed to deliver for us. He was, without a doubt, one of my favorite strikers, during his time at Porto and Atletico.

8462~~~
Please let this happen.

Liverpool trying to press or counter with Falcao up top would be great news.

In reality though they'd have to be mad, wouldn't they? It'd be like trying to top the idiocy of the Balotelli signing.

8463~~~
Meh, provided we don't sign him, couldn't give a monkeys where he ends up.

8464~~~
Would be another strange transfer for Liverpool, not sure I can see it happening. Wouldn't care if he did go there anyway.

8465~~~
No way are Liverpool paying his wages.

If I were him, I would go to Valencia. But it's kind of sad how it didn't work out.

8466~~~
Not even sure if it's because he's not fully recovered from his injury, or wasn't able to play in Van Gaal's system. But whatever it is, looks like he's on the way out. Pity though, he seems a likeable guy, and really wanted to do well for us.

PSG is going to want to sell him as a "glamour signing" of sorts, ie. big money. I doubt Liverpool will stump up the cash, but City might just go for it.

8467~~~
Even though he has done nothing of worth here, i still would not want to see him at Pool. Hope some spanish side picks him up and he does alright for himself.

Unless some miracle happens and he scores 15 in the remaining games, there is no way he is staying here.

8468~~~
I have no problem with Liverpool signing a player not good enough to get into our team.

8469~~~
I wasn't speaking about that game in particular.

I'm totally with you this one. Most of the times it's just the heat of the moment that causes these sort of words. On the other hand he's a public person and is paid a lot of money to do his job - and in the end it's all your money that you've earned by doing your part in society that goes down in his pockets. If he's suppose to get that much more you could at least expect to see some sort of commitment and dignity. But yes, I will do my best to adjust my language to help the caf raise its level.

8471~~~
What?

8472~~~
It would be funny if he went to Liverpool after some of the stuff Rawk have said about him this season.

Having said that, he would probably do quite well there as they do create a lot of chances (when on form). Lack of chances is whats cost him with us imo, sure he's missed some sitters as well no doubt about it but if you are only getting 2 or 3 clear chances a game, it must be hard for any striker no matter how good they are.

8473~~~
Fair play, classy reply when some would've gotten defensive.

And I totally know what you mean. The amount of money that Falcao has taken from our club is ridiculous - while it's not his 'fault' directly, I can't help but cringe when I see him being spoken about on here like he's in some kind of 'tragic situation'.

Likewise, seeing stories in the press from his associates talking about they 'cry together' makes me really angry when a single week's wages of Falcao could help most people (including myself) change their lives for the better.

But you know, that's the way the game is structured, it's not his fault.

His performances, though, are entirely his own responsibility, and that's something everyone seems very keen to absolve him of.

8474~~~
You just know he'll bang in 20+ goals at another PL team. It's such a shame it hasn't worked out.

8475~~~
Not sure what to make of that post. You have to be more specific on what part is not clear here or I can't help you.

8476~~~
He better not be going to Pool. I see his agent's messy fingerprints all over these 'rumours'…. not very sophisticated imo. Falcao better off in Spain or Italy.

8477~~~
He's not good enough for us and he'll tear Liverpool's wage structure apart, they can fecking forget about counter attacking football as well. Win win win.

8478~~~
And big transfer fee. And Smalling will handle him comfortably.  Win x 5.

8479~~~
I think him going to Liverpool would be a possibility. As high as his wage demands would generally be, he may have to let them take a bit of a hit since most clubs might be reluctant to sign him after his poor form this season.

Hope he doesn't go to Liverpool though, since we just know he'd end up being the PL's top scorer for them or something, with a hat-trick against us included.

8480~~~
The dippers can't afford 300k/week wages. I think he will almost certainly have to return to Monaco or get sold off by them to another Sugardaddy club.

8481~~~
Depends though - he may be willing to take a pay cut in order to stay in the area.

I'd hope (dearly) that even at 150,000 a week Woodward would get rid of him, but to 'Pool that might be a gamble they fancy...

Though I have to say, his absolute lack of pace, inability to keep up with counter attacks, inability to press from the front and his propensity to get brushed aside by every English defence he's faced makes me very skeptical that any top 6 PL side would have any interest in him at all.

If he went to Liverpool, with the way they play, they'd be worse with him in the side.

8482~~~
It will be interesting to see what happens to him. His team has done a great job in the media by attempting making it look like Manchester United and Louis van Gaal are entirely to blame for his poor form. Nobody in their right mind will pay 40 Million for him, but I can see a few clubs gambling on him at 20 Million. As long as he doesn't go to anyone we're competing with, I wish him all the best. He tried and it seemed like he really wanted to make it here, it just didn't work out. He's been Forlan without the memorable goals.

Also, we need to praise Ed Woodward on this. Maybe the best move we made in the tranfer market since Vidic and Evra was getting him on loan, rather than buying him outright. We dodged a huge bullet with this one.

8483~~~
I would like to see what he could do in our new found system from the start of a game. All of our strikers/attacking players were finding it hard for large parts of this season. Maybe Van Gaal has lost complete faith in him though, but would be nice to see him get a start in this 4-3-3.

8484~~~
He can't press from the front effectively or with any intensity, so our 'new found system' wouldn't work with him up top alone.

He also can't break from deep and keep up with the attack, so is useless on the counter-attack.

These things have been blatantly apparent since he arrived here and they have nothing to do with 'service', or with formation.

8485~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

8486~~~
I'd be alright with him joining Liverpool, that's how poor he's been.

8487~~~
I'd rather him not go to Liverpool. I'm sure in the right situation he'd rediscover at least some of previous form. Even some of what he was is a fearsome prospect.

8488~~~
I'd have no worries about him going to a rival. I reckon he's finished at the top level.

8489~~~
Its a bullshit story anyway, probably leaked by his agent to worry us into making a move.

8490~~~
There should of been warning signs when Madrid didn't buy him last summer. I mean the press made it sound like it was a certainty and Madrid are the biggest muppet club there is and there weren't many bigger 'names' than Falcao available last summer.

8491~~~
I feel like his pressing has been quite good to be honest, but because he was so isolated from our midfield at times there was no reason for him to press as there was always a pass on for the opposition. Maybe you are right but I would still like to see him start one game in this system and see if he trully isn't built for the league.

8492~~~
Him and Costa, with Remy as backup, would be quite a strike force. Don't know how well he'd fit into Mou's plans, though.

8493~~~
He won't stay in this league. I don't think he will risk another difficult year in the premier league. It's just too quick, too intense and too physical for him. Another tough year like this one and his stock will be at rock bottom, he currently has some benefit of the doubt that it's the circumstances at United rather than him and he could reach old heights.

8494~~~
Can't imagine him going to a team out of the CL for a second year running, even if he has been poor.

Like Liverpool can afford a £40m fee + wages for a question mark.

8495~~~
Yes please.Liverpool with Balotelli and Falcao (the current one) as strikers would set them up to another 5 no CL season.

8496~~~
He'll move on to some rich Russian team where he'll score about 6 goals. Not the Falcao we remember from Spain and Portugal.

8497~~~
He's been a disappointment but he's not alone. DM has been shocking without the excuses of injuries. I think LVG has said it takes a season to settle and I think that applies to all the newbies. I get the feeling its not a done deal that he's going. Watch this space but I recon he'll still be here next season. We'll sign him for an undisclosed fee to save everyone's blushes and renegotiate his terms.

8498~~~
Hopefully he breaks the Transfer embargo between both clubs.

8499~~~
I suppose it would be a step up for them after being unable to sign a player unable to get in our team (Valdes).

Baby steps n all.

He doesn't belong to us.

8500~~~
Forgot about that,surely we are the only ones foolish enough to pay his wages

8501~~~
His agent just released this statement:

Spirit of Beauty, that dost consecrate
With thine own hues all thou dost shine upon
Of human thought or form, – where art thou gone?
Why dost thou pass away and leave our state,
This dim vast vale of tears, vacant and desolate?

He won't stay in England now. That nails it.

8502~~~
On performances this season though i'd rather keep Drogba.

8503~~~
Progress.

8504~~~
I can imagine exactly that. He has  a phobia of that competition.  Could see Everton taking a punt.

8505~~~
If he cut his wage demands, I'd want him to stay tbh - a full pre-season and a run of games without injury he's going to hit form again, not as ruthless as his Atleti days maybe, but he'll add a sizeable amount of goals.

8506~~~
Why? He has brought nothing to the team in his year here. We have a 25-man squad for Premier League and (hopefully) Champions League, I'd rather we had good players capable of positive contribution in there as opposed to a big name that hasn't delivered in the slightest.

8507~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8508~~~
Not for 43m.

8509~~~
Maybe i'm being hopeful but he just seems out of sorts and hasn't had enough time back playing regular football.

He's not worth his price tag though not even close.

8510~~~
His age is also a big issue for me, even if he does improve somewhat he'll decline very quickly. Would prefer someone younger like Dybala.

8511~~~
Definitely, I'd rather give Wilson some game time ahead of Falcao too.

8512~~~
He's had a year. He's not proven himself and needs to leave.

8513~~~
BBC Sport article...

<i><b>Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao says "calls are coming in everyday" as he looks for a club where he can play regularly.</b></i>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32049027" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32049027</a>

8514~~~
He's not even just not proven himself, he's barely shown a flicker. Of his 4 goals, 2 were taps ins. The others were decent enough goals, but I'd back any Premier League striker to bag those chances. If he'd even managed 1 game where he looked close to his best then there might be room for debate, but he hasn't. 

If we're taking risks I'd rather take a risk on some young striker that's just bagged a hatful of goals in Italy or France than a risk on Falcao.

8515~~~
A dark horse to replace Berahino at West Brom?

8516~~~
Exactly, there hasn't been a single point aside from perhaps his first 30 minutes on the pitch for us where he genuinely looked good against Leicester where he'd have justified spending any money on him, or even merit a place in our 25-man squad.

8517~~~
He's gone. The club decided that as far back as January.

Martin Samuel, one of the most experienced and well-connected men in British sports writing said as much. 

Falcao has struggled a lot more than our other summer signings. Di Maria has generally been one of the team's better players, in spite of his recent struggles, and has contributed towards more points on the board than Falcao.

Falcao has been rather terrible, which is quite sad. I wish him all the luck in the world, but his time here is done. On this season's evidence he'll struggle to excel in England full stop.

8518~~~
Don't really care where he ends up next season - he's finished as a top level striker.

8519~~~
This is hilarious.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Take a look at this video on YouTube:
Radamel Falcao: 'Please Don't Make Me Play For Liverpool!'*
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SoOYCX3CdaA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

8520~~~
I think his best is probably behind him but I wouldnt write him off just yet - Im sure he would score goals as a regular starter in Serie A or somewhere like that. But he is going to have to take a serious wage cut

8521~~~
Physically he is done. He is just very one-paced, and that isn't a particularly fast pace. 
I guess he could go to Italy, but I don't think we'll see him scoring 20+ goals a season in a top league again.

8522~~~
Drogba is a definitely a better player.

8523~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8524~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8525~~~
It's over, close all the Falcao threads.

8526~~~
Thankfully it was just a loan. Hopefully we can spend that money on a potential world class striker. I wish him the best of luck and think he'll be better next year, but not anywhere near the Falcao that played for Atletico

8527~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8528~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
He reminds me of a member of the Jackson family, got that sort of femine look about him.

8529~~~
So many having no faith in LVG, and so many having no faith in Falcao.

Pretty confident he will come good. If we continue  as we are now with 1 up front I think he would fit in. Both him and RVP have performed  poorly because of us not gelling as a team. To be fair Rooney has been pretty poor as well.

I know I am in the minority, but I don't think he is a Torres.

8530~~~
So many things wrong with this comment.

8531~~~
Not sure what, it is an opinion. 

I think Falcao will come good others dont.

8532~~~
An equivalent argument to this, in terms of mentalness would be "I think Newcastle are a good team and now they've got a new manager I can see them getting Top 4".

8533~~~
He'll struggle to get much time on the pitch with one striker, which won't be him.

8534~~~
We are pretty close to having our 4 most creative players in midfield, so there will be lots of opportunities hopefully for the striker. I am sure the order of attack will be Rooney > RVP > Falcao. So Yes he may not get many opportunities, but what is to say if he did get a chance he would be poor given a good supply. 
To me he gets far too much criticism when we as a team have created very few chances. RVP and Rooney have also struggled up top. People protect Rooney because of his work rate upfront. However, how long did it take him to have a shot on target in 2015.

8535~~~
He absolutely might come good, but I don't see him getting any meaningful time here this season.

He won't want to risk potentially sitting on our bench next season, he'll want a starting job to repair his reputation.

And we won't want to pay what he costs at this point.

8536~~~
Falcao definitely would still come good in FM.

8537~~~
I tend to agree there. United just hasn't been a good team for a striker this season (or last season). Let alone one recovering from an injury and settling in. It's still difficult to judge Falcao and whether he really is 'done' like some people believe. But with so few matches remaining, he's unlikely to really 'come good' this season.

8538~~~
While he might "come good" next year, is it worth the risk of giving him a long term contract on a 1 million a month contract at his age? god no. He won't have "sell on value", he arguably isn't even the best striker anymore in the team so he cannot justify his wages.

It makes no business sense, and the sense of optimism is only fueled by his past performances. Some people never recover fully to their past glories from injury, and unfortunately Falcao is 1 of those. 

He needs to have the team built around him with legs with cut backs from the byline, that is something he won't get in LVG's team. 

Unfortunately he is just in the wrong form, at the wrong club at the wrong time.

8539~~~
While I understand many feel he may come good again even when I take away the low goals I'm still not thrilled with his link up play. He rarely seems to have the ball under control and he's often getting knocked over which in past leagues he probably got fouls for.  I can forego the goals if you are producing in other areas but he's not. At this rate he is like Danny Welbeck but with 1/3 the pace and stamina. That's just not good enough for our standard.

8540~~~
Indeed. As I've said before, if we're going to take a risk, why not take a risk on a young striker who's scoring tonnes of goals in the world somewhere? There's always someone in Portugal or France or Italy that's ripping up trees in any given season. For the salary & transfer fee we'd be spending on Falcao we could buy almost any young talent in the world.

8541~~~
Yep, lump it all on Dybala or Lacazette or Vietto. This is our problem recently, buying people who've been there and done it with no further ambition.

8542~~~
He needs a lot of games and patience to find his best form again. He wont get that at United so I think it's more beneficial if he moves on

8543~~~
Why couldn't he do this against West Ham...?

8544~~~
Scored his second now.

8545~~~

8546~~~
His 2nd goal:

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/O3dZUPw2JM6/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

8547~~~
Why can't he do this for us!

8548~~~
I'm only happy 'gainst Bahrain
I'm only happy when it's not complicated
And though I know you don't appreciate it
I'm only happy 'gainst Bahrain
You know I love it when the goalie's bad
I'd probably like to play against your dad
I'm only happy 'gainst Bahrain

Pour your misery down 
Pour your misery down on me
Pour your misery down 
Pour your misery down on me

8549~~~
Because he's playing against far better opposition then Bahrain?

8550~~~
Take it you missed the Yeovil game, and Falcaos u21 match

8551~~~
Regardless of opposition that 1st goal is still a great finish.

8552~~~
Unfortunately I didn't <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

8553~~~
I'd think he feels a lot less pressure there too. He gets to play the full match and he's probably a lot more comfortable with less to prove.

8554~~~
he probably enjoys playing football away from our team

8555~~~
Hopefully does his confidence good and scores against Villa again

8556~~~
On the 1st goal he has far too many time and space. The 2nd one is lucky and dodgy as feck. In the right setup and a team build around him, he can score lot of goals again. Unfortunately, i dont see him playing well for us with the tactics we employ.

8557~~~
Against shit opposition, where he's the undisputed main man? Yeah, I'd say he probably does.

8558~~~
Nice to see him scoring again.

8559~~~
Not really when that keeper is pub team quality, he wouldn't score that against even a championship keeper.

8560~~~
The Colombia team is set up perfectly for him. So was Monaco's. So was Atletico's.

If we didn't have Rooney and Van Persie, if Di Maria played wide and Mata played behind Falcao, we'd see the best of Falcao. As it happens he's playing a game that he only does to a so-so level.

8561~~~
What if...

8562~~~
It was Bahrain...

8563~~~
Nice to see him scoring, and that first was a good first time finish even if he had loads of space. The second one he slips and mishit it though so it's a bit lucky. It's something I've noticed this season though, his overall shooting just seems so much worse. He mishits them really often, they're generally pretty weak and so the keeper saves them easily. Nothing like how he was before his injury when he strikes the ball.

8564~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8565~~~
Even then they defended better than those clips

8566~~~
Looks like I could cause those Bahrain center backs some problems and I'm recovering from a long term injury and can barely run.

8567~~~
Radamel? Is that you?

8568~~~
Who is this guy???!

8569~~~
Since when could he actually run?

8570~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> well done, sinch.

8571~~~
Am I seeing things or does it look like he has lost pace, despite the good movement behind the line?

8572~~~
He probably feels liberated knowing in familiar surroundings he's got the backing to play his natural game. He started off well here but has got worse and worse as time has gone on probably due to a mental factor in that he's practically failing an audition. He hasn't got much time as it is, and in fairness has probably been wondering for much of the season when his next chance will come. Yes it's sad that against Yeovil and Cambridge and Spurs U21 he made no impact, but then it's sad that a United team couldn't create an opening for the striker too. I think this international break will do him a lot of good as he can get away from it all, and do something to feel good about himself. Whilst I wouldn't buy him for next season, it'll be good for us and him for a change of fortunes in the run in.

8573~~~
If he was at full speed. Yes, he lost a lot of speed.

8574~~~
Nearly all the Bahrain squad play in Bahrain, the standard must be about League 2 level, if that.

8575~~~
Hello Falcao.

8576~~~
Wasn't he also in the Liverpool match?

8577~~~
That was Anderson

8578~~~
Good thing he is actually doing well to secure a move to a new club

8579~~~
Hopefully he gets his confidence back when he's back with us. 

The Manchester United striker struck twice in four minutes for his country as national coach Jose Pekerman vows to help him overcome his "sadness" and lack of confidence

8580~~~
Scoring is better than not scoring even if the opposition is poor.  But what is Colombia doing playing Behran and then Kuwait?  The money offered must be really good.

8581~~~
I am glad he scored. Not sure it means a whole lot considering the opposition and stuff though.

8582~~~
I don't care if it's just Bahrain....goals are goals and that can only help Falcao

If Kane scores a couple against Lithuania tomorrow then he's the king of England

8583~~~
Kane's the PL's leading goal scorer ahead of Costa, Aguero, Sanchez and Rooney...

8584~~~
and it's Falcao's first bad season in his career

8585~~~
exactly

8586~~~
You're saying he's garbage?

8587~~~
Falcao needs a team to be built around him. It was the case in Porto, Atleti, Monaco but not at United. 

He does not have the all around game like Van Persie possesses to be the target man and bring people into play. The man is a wonderful goalscorer but that's where it stops. He is an advanced version of Hernandez who possesses strength and power. Sadly, he's unable to follow the teachings of Van Gaal and progress at United.

He'll go somewhere else at the end of the season, somewhere where he doesn't need to be a disciplined, pressing forward. Somewhere he won't have to follow the strict regimen put in place by LVG.

You see the thing is this, if Falcao came when Fergie was around, he'd have been so much more successful. Everything was well and the club was very stable. BUt, now he comes at a time of great tumult at United. A team where risks in results can no longer be taken. Manchester United no longer have the luxury of playing unhappy players. Only the result is king, because we need to get back to winning ways. For that, we need a consistent way of playing, a consistent meritocracy and most importantly a constant hand at the wheel.

We smashed Tottenham and battered Liverpool in their own den in the space of 7 days. These things don't happen unless the system is finally getting through to the players and it only happens when the players believe in their manager's ways. 

Falcao should bow away gracefully. How many clubs in the world were willing to take a chance on a broken striker who needed to be payed absurd amounts of money every week? One who is coming back from an injury that has ended or scathed many a football career? We took him in. Made him stronger. Gave him a chance, we really did. It just didn't work out.

It is a great misfortune that one of the great goalscorers of the last 10 years doesn't fit into that mould. LVG has installed a powerful meritocracy at United. You play according to his ways, or you don't. This is what Fergie used to do regardless of name and reputation. With Giggs by his side, LVG can power on with his ways, as it should be in these trying times. No one matters more than the club. Sorry Falcao, it just wasn't meant to be.

8588~~~
Think the big thing about Falcao was 1 his previous injury 2 the pace of the premier league and 3 playing in a team struggling for an identity. Put them all together and it's easy to see why he struggled settling but he's a great player who is to expensive to take that sort of risk on finically with his age and outlay. Loan deal worth the gamble but permanent not as unfortunately it's not worked out. The only way this guy is heading back to the premier league or la liga is with a massive drop in fee and wages.

8589~~~
It was Yeovil and it was Cambridge. What's your point?

8590~~~
I do feel for him a little bit. He had many opportunities in our team but mainly when we were tinkering with all sorts of systems and never really had a good flow to our play. I suspect he'd thrive much more in this set up than he did in the previous ones, the problem being it would likely mean dropping Rooney.

8591~~~
goals are goals, regardless of the opposition.

hopefully he can still get a few for us while he is here. don't think he can blame LVG for lack of opportunities. he just failed to deliver most of the time.

8592~~~
Might as well sign Matt Tubbs then.

8593~~~
I should have expected this...

8594~~~
I'm delighted he scored but is it just me that's very cynical about the keepers attempts to save those two goals?

8595~~~
"cynical"? Are you suggesting he deliberately didn't try to save them? If so, I find that quite bizarre. He's likely just not very good.

8596~~~
Yeah Falcao only happens against Bahrain?
I don't think, he would do it against Turkay
'Cos strikers, they will come and they will go
And since he's really thirty three, we know

We know...

8597~~~
Are you saying that Mendes wouldn't grease the palm of some lowly Bahrain goalkeeper to boost the ailing profile of one of his blue chip assets?

8598~~~
There's an awful lot of money riding on Falcaos next move/contract and football agents aren't the most honest types so yeah I'd be cynical of stuff like that.

Hopefully not though

8599~~~
I'm not saying he wouldn't because I don't know the man. However I'd hope that he wouldn't and I doubt that he did.

2 goals against Bahrain are hardly going to have Europe's elite scrapping to sign Falcao.

8600~~~
If you look at his goals the first one is struck into the side netting making it actually a very good finish. We're not talking about 2 goalkeeping howlers here and I'd say it's a bit odd to jump to a conclusion like that. Some people do love a good conspiracy theory though so...

8601~~~
No conspiracy theory, I just think the keeper looks like he doesn't try too hard to save them

8602~~~
Should give him a start next week and rest rooney. See if he can carry on where he left off here. With the way we've been playing there's plenty of places goals can come from if he falls short

8603~~~
That's my boy. Funny how the other players look for his run and give it to him. Still hoping he proves  himself at United.

8604~~~
8 games are enough to earn a £40m transfer?

8605~~~
Absolute insanity.

8606~~~
So do I, because if not, he sure as hell will elsewhere. Anyway if it was up to the schoolgirls we would have replaced every player in the squad to get some shiny new toys

8607~~~
I think the £40million price tag will be significantly reduced no matter who buys him.

8608~~~
it was fecking BAHRAIN, no offence

8609~~~
Not by 50% though, which is what Falcao is worth right now.

8610~~~
Saying Falcao in his prime was like a better version of Hernandez is way off the mark. 

If i use a game I'm sure most here saw, when he took apart Chelsea. Hernandez could never ever have a game like that. He can score against big teams, but not how Falcao did V Chelsea that day. 

He scored similar goals V Barca in his time at Atletico but not quite as good all round performance as V Chelsea. He scored on the biggest stages he has played on. 

The comparison doesn't hold up at all, except for with current day Falcao.

8611~~~
And as has already been said "it was fecking Cambridge and Yeovil!"

He'd do better in the system we're playing now. Problem is he needs to get ahead of Rooney in the queue.

8612~~~
We had 30 games to find a system for him and we failed, this is really not the time to help Falcao secure a move to another club, he can do that from the bench, worked for Hernandez.

Top 4 is not guaranteed, Liverpool have put their top 4 ambitions ahead of accommodating Balotelli, i suggest we do the same with Falcao.

8613~~~
Bingo. We are not signing him, he has no place in our First XI. At best he'll get minutes if Rooney and Van Persie are both out. It's game face time.

8614~~~
Look how happy he looks.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CBGu4hyUUAAi3am.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CBGu4hyUUAAi3am.jpg"/>

8615~~~
I was being a little bit daft. I wouldn't put it past Mendes but it is more likely that the keeper is just bloody awful.

People on here are starting to read something into that performance, however. To me it means absolutely nothing as Bahrain are at what, League 2, level?

8616~~~
We really need to stop signing nice blokes, its always hard to criticise them, i always think of Mendes' face when I'm criticising Falcao and Di Maria.

8617~~~
Wasn't suggesting anything like that. Just that he'd more likely thrive in a system like we have now rather than the one he was playing in.

8618~~~
Starting him in place of Rooney would be nothing short of lunacy.

I'd happily give him 30 minutes though if the game is going well and we're a few goals to the good.

Having said that, considering the fact that there's no way we'll be coughing up £40m to sign him, I'm not sure there's much point.

8619~~~
Yeah, whatever he does now, its going to be too little too late. Which is a shame for me personally as I had high hopes <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

8620~~~
If we gave him a cameo in each of the remaining games and he started scoring I'd be open to the idea of another loan spell to see if he can kick on, but I doubt that'd be on the table. Plus I don't see him doing it.

8621~~~
No hes not. Costa is 1st, they both have 19 but it goes on who has played fewer games.

8622~~~
That's the last thing we should do, Rooney is a better player and better suited to the current system, top four is also far from guaranteed so there is no room or point to experimenting with falcao. 

He took his goals well but the standard of defending and goalkeeping was shocking, learnt nothing from that game. Let someone else take the risk on him next season, I don't imagine there will be many takers unless his wages are slashed and it's another loan deal. 

If anything it will be even tougher selling him this summer than last summer because he has played so badly, there is no indication he has or will recover from his injury and he will be 30 within six months of the summer transfer window.

8623~~~
Yeah another loan wouldn't be a bad idea, but I fear that will again bring the 'Rooney conundrum' to the fore - fit another striker by pushing Rooney into midfield as he's otherwise undroppable. No thanks!

8624~~~
Good point.

Id rather see Rooney and RVP fighting for one position in the big games. Possibly play both against weaker teams at home.

8625~~~
He scored two goals for Colombia. Rejoice.

8626~~~
To be fair the last thing we should do is Olay de gea there. Falcao is still a striker

8627~~~
googled this Tubbs guy and my word, 213 career goals <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8628~~~
I think we should sign him just so we have a player we can call 'Tubby' or 'The Tubbster'.

8629~~~
I can't wait to see the back of him tbh. Nice guy and all that but, firstly, I'm tired of all the discussion of why he has been shit and why he might by some miracle not be shit next time he plays. Well, I hope he doesn't play any time soon as it will suggest Rooney is injured or back in midfield. No ta. Secondly, it would be quite nice to actually have a different option to call on other than Van Persie or Falcao. For £500k a week we should be able to sign a couple of really dangerous, productive strikers.

Pretty bored of him stinking the place out right now to be honest.

8630~~~
Lithuania are hardly great shakes either. He'll probably find his feet somewhere again. Not here unfortunately. Shame as he was a beast at Porto/Atleti and I watched him week in week out. He's never been much more than a pure finisher though. People expecting lots more were way off the mark. The Chelsea game is one people go on about but I don't think I've ever seen him have such a complete game before.

8631~~~
change nothing unless there is a need. we don't know if he'd thrive in any system v any team.

8632~~~
You're missing Anderson, aren't you?

8633~~~
Agree. Also, our striking options are a bit imbalanced in terms of ages as we have three who are in the latter stages of their careers and one who is some way off being ready. We need to get one, or even two, up and coming strikers who are good enough already to be first team players but with the potential to develop and improve further.

8634~~~
He just scored a penalty against Kuwait and equals Arnoldo Iguarán's record as top Colombian goalscorer.
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OLrTj0ueLLZ/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

8635~~~
Another goal, albeit a penalty.

Would be nice if this break would give him confidence to end the season on a high for us.

8636~~~
That's why he should of taken the penalty vs Liverpool. Always been good at them

8637~~~
Look at that penalty.. No way the keeper is saving that.

8638~~~
That's one confidently struck penalty! Hopefully his goals during this international break do his confidence some favours, even if they are against some shite countries.

8639~~~
That's one sweetly struck penalty. Hope he can come on and grab himself a goal on saturday.

8640~~~
Thats a fecking brilliant penalty <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8641~~~
Fluke, he skied it and was lucky it caught the underside of the bar.

8642~~~
3 goals in 2 games, if he gets significant minutes against Villa, he could get a goal. Looking at 4 goals in 3 games. Happy for him. 

That was a confident penalty as well. Just showing Rooney how it's done.

8643~~~
Correct

8644~~~
Emphatic.

8645~~~
greatest penalty ever, fact!

8646~~~
Bahrain and Kuwait for gods sake.

8647~~~
Well done you for knowing who Columbia were playing.

8648~~~
That penalty. It doesn't matter if the opposition was Bahrain, Kuwait or 3 Manuel Neuers. It's not getting saved.

Love penalties like that. No fannying about with stutter runs, or trying to roll the goalkeeper the wrong way. Just make it impossible to save, take the goalkeeper out of the equation.

8649~~~
Here come the bells.

8650~~~
What a star. On a roll. Now start putting them in for United.

8651~~~
It's just ridiculous people think him scoring against pub teams that RedCafe members could beat means he'll be in confident mood for scoring against Prem opposition.

And before anyone says Yeovil/Cambridge, etc...he couldn't even score consistently against them.

8652~~~
He should be starting for us next time we play Kuwait or Bahrain imo.

8653~~~
So you think these goals will have no effect on his confidence? 

Him putting a penalty in the top corner isn't an effect of him scoring 2 the other day? There isn't the possibility that a few goals will increase his confidence? 

I think every striker who has ever suffered a dry spell in front of goal will say that a goal, any kind of goal, would boost their confidence.

8654~~~
There's something about him that's likable and im not sure what it is . 
If I found him in bed with the wife Id probably make him a brew .
He's got one of them faces .
I so wished he would do well for us and im not sure why im saddened by it given how much money he's earning

8655~~~
With the money i'd blackmail out of him for selling the story i'd make him some beluga caviar wine.

8656~~~
It's homoeroticism.

Nothing wrong with it, but that's what it is.

8657~~~
Don't get me wrong, I really want him to go straight back into the team and score a hattrick in every game from now on - his chant is quality, but I'm finally contempt that he's shit. 

Falcao is shit. 

Falcao is, shit. 

Shit Falcao, is. 

Shit Falcao scored against shit Bahrain (who are worse than shit Cambridge) and shit Kuwait (who are worse than shit Yeovil).

8658~~~
When I saw this post I thought that you were being sarc, but after watching the vid, well, I would like to see a better one!

8659~~~
You Kuwait to Bahrain on his parade could you?

8660~~~
That was some penalty. And yet we persist with Rooney...

8661~~~
If we could flog RvP for £20 million, and buy Falcao for the same fee, and lower wages then i'd be for that,  he 'could' just come good and reveal his true self, RvP on the other hand just seems to have lost his edge, and for me his interest. 

Not going to happen though.

8662~~~
Yes I thought that too ,but then I thought the same about tevez , phil Neville and luke Chadwick and quickly ruled that out .

8663~~~
Maybe you just like watching? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8664~~~
He isn't though. I'd be fuming if my club paid £20m for Falcao right now!

8665~~~
Sell a striker who still provides 15 goal a season when fit (and his fitness record has actually been fine) and buy a striker who provides 5 goals a season?

8666~~~
3 goals against any opposition is good and that was a confident and perfect penalty. If he scored against Villa next weekend some of you would still look for a reason to criticize.

8667~~~
15 goals?

8668~~~
Yeah. Scored 18 last season, is on 10 goals in 25 games this season and would have probably hit 15 if it hadn't been for his recent injury. He won't reach 15 now because he's not going to play match in match out in the final 8 games I believe.

8669~~~
Amazing how three goals against non league level opposition can change the perception of a player!

8670~~~
Do you believe he should start over Rooney as a single striker?

8671~~~
Or over RVP when he will be fit again ?

8672~~~
This is the Cafe. Di Maria is shit, there's no available fullback thats better than Valencia.

8673~~~
Yeah but RVP would be in the last year of his contract, while we'd be signing up Falcao for a 4 yr minimum. That changes the risk considerably.

8674~~~
I really want to see Falcao come good in these last few games; he won't start over Rooney though, fact no matter what. The system we are now playing would probably suit him best too. It hasn't worked out for him alongside RVP, nor with Rooney in midfield. 4-4-1-1 is perfect for him and unfortunately I feel its too late to give him a run. Such a shame. He'll probably end up back in Spain next season and will be prolific once again.

As mentioned above; I'd take a punt on him at £20m for sure

8675~~~
We'd need to be Dick Turpin to get 20m for RvP at this point. If he leaves us it'll be for 8-10m or on a free next year. As for Falcao, penalty or no penalty, confidence or not, we'd need to see him banging them in consistently for the next 8 weeks if we're to even consider paying those wages for another season.

8676~~~
I really don't understand why people say they'd take a punt on him at £20m. Even in decent form he'd still be a 29-year old striker who has had injury problems in the past two seasons, £20m would be contentious in this scenario. Now add his utterly terrible form and lack of significant contribution for the team in the past year and you're left with basically no justification for spending £20m on him.

8677~~~
Put Falcao in Arsenal or Chelsea and watch him flourish, he isn't flourishing in United because he has lost that World Class ability to score goals in a team where strikers aren't being served, Rooney still has that ability.

Sell Falcao to Arsenal for £20m and put him in front of that midfield that worships strikers and watch him perform his magic.

8678~~~
What is this based on? His finishing has looked terrible here.

8679~~~
how many times has he actually been 1 on 1 ? Giroud takes 7 one on ones to score, which just goes to show you the type of midfield Arsenal have.

8680~~~
Or maybe it shows you Falcao's lack of pace to get onto anything. Every time he runs behind a defence he gets caught within a second!

8681~~~
Which is why i alluded to the fact that he probably needs a team where he has to be at the right place at the right time and not have to run.

8682~~~
It's a no brainer to keep RvP over Falcao, regardless of the costs involved.

8683~~~
Which is great, but that isn't us. Like you said he can go to a team and have them built around him, but even his finishing has looked poor for us. That match against Tottenham away was the eye opener for me. He never hit any of his shots cleanly and kept stumbling over his own legs.

8684~~~
I was replying to someone saying Falcao isn't worth £20m to a team like Arsenal, scroll up.

8685~~~
He wouldn't get games for either of those teams.

8686~~~
Mourinho loves to collect strikers and Falcao would thrive under Wenger.

8687~~~
Drogba and Remy hardly play and he wouldn't get in ahead of Giroud. The way he's played, he wouldn't even get in ahead of Welbeck either.

8688~~~
Based on what?

8689~~~
He would be sat on the bench at both Chelsea and Arsenal and given his form wouldn't even be first choice to come off the bench. There is no indication he is anything like the player he once was and unless that changes he isn't going to thrive at any top team because he won't even get on the pitch.

8690~~~
Granted, he isn't the player he was in Atletico,it still doesn't mean he is shit, spending your first season back from a lengthy injury in a new league,team with midfielders that don't feed strikers will definitely be tough on any player.

8691~~~
Like i've said previously I would like to see him in our new system and see how he fairs. In regards to his international goals although they may be against poor opposition, sometimes that is all you need to start firing again as long as people at the club are believing in him and not shooting him down; he can grow in confidence and have a big say in the rest of our season.

8692~~~
Sure this is posted on this thread somewhere but it's the first time I saw it so I just thought I'd stick it on as a reminder of what a nice chap he seems to be:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/agZpLxBgzkI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

I'd really love him to come good personally but see little chance that he'll stay. If we can reduce the sign-on fee perhaps he'll stay and RvP will go but he has to start turning in performances sharpish!

8693~~~
Its not worked out for him here and i'm 100% certain we won't buy him. Its just a shame because you just know he is going to bag a ton of goals for some other team, i just hope its not a team in our league or we will look stupid.

8694~~~
It’s tough but that is the situation he is in here and would be at any of the top sides in the league, no team creates chance after chance on a plate and their strikers get into better positions because they are physically stronger, faster etc, Falcao might finish some of Giroud’s chances better but he probably wouldn’t be on the end of at least half of them. They all expect their strikers to be more than just poachers as well. He simply hasn’t been good enough and I don’t see why any of the Premier League teams who could afford him would even consider signing him.

8695~~~
He did all he could against those sides but ultimately it means nothing, no need to put him back in the side as Rooney plays the role much better and makes no sense to change the formation or drop anyone else to accomodate him. If he is to have any say in the season it will probably be an important goal after coming on as a sub, that is about it.

He has had great support from the fans and been given plenty of opportunities, he could and should have been droppped much earlier but I think there was a real desire for him to succeed so he kept getting games but now finishing in the top 4 outweighs supporting Falcao.

8696~~~
Makes me feel a bit sorry for him watching that, and then I remember his wages and the fact he gets to pull on a United shirt for said wages! He does seem like a really nice bloke though, a shame if it doesn't work out as it appears not to be.

8697~~~
no, of course not.

8698~~~
I'm sure he did get some bit of a boost from his goalscoring exploits over the international break, but it's still wouldn't be enough to start him as far as I'm concerned (especially considering the opposition). I'd still stick with Rooney, despite his poor showing against Liverpool, as he offers the best movement we've seen from any of our strikers this season.

8699~~~
Indeed. The club is bigger then the player. I wish the lad all the best and I might even take him over RvP for another season if he would be able to prove that he's coming back to his old level, but I can't see any reason why we should play him over Rooney bar injuries.

8700~~~
Anyone saw the penalty? doesn't strike me as a player low on confidence.

Rooney are u watching? This is how u score a penalty

8701~~~
Quite. We've seen for an entire season that Falcao is simply too slow for the PL, this will only get worse.

Good luck to him in the future, but anyone thinking a couple of goals against pro-am opposition changes his standing at United needs a reality check.

8702~~~
Most on here thought the same about Mata and Herrera. LVG even admitted that Mata was one if not his best player but it was getting him to play the role he wanted. Herrera is now a better fit in the team. Pretty sure as we become more confident at playing the ball forward he will be given balls to run on to, or played in front of him when he is in the box. Strikers with no confidence can't hit a barn door as RVP and Rooney have proven. The fact Falcao has just scored some goals shows he is not really suffering from confidence.

8703~~~
Reading anything into that penalty is just nuts. I could walk out onto a football pitch and slot a pen like that right now and I'm 42 and have no ACL in my left knee.

8704~~~
People still trotting out the 'He'd score 20 at Arsenal/Chelsea/City' nonsense, despite looking totally out of water with the pace and intensity of PL.

8705~~~
I wouldn't mind giving him a game soon as long as we don't change our system or style of play which we have seen over the last few weeks.

8706~~~
Lets wait until top 4 is sorted before then though , eh?

8707~~~
Maybe we should rest Wazza for the up coming city game.

Just give Falcao a start up top and see what he can do. Vila are poor and we should be beating them fairly easily.

8708~~~
Maybe we should also rest Van Gaal for the rest of the season and just put Falcao in charge for the remaining games...

Gotta give the guy every opportunity to prove what he can do.

8709~~~
That'll be the one.

Falcao would need to take a major wage cut for it to be even close to viable, there's just something about him I like though so I wouldn't be too annoyed if we kept him.

8710~~~
Falcao on a 3 year deal, for £20 million, at £150 k per week if it was dobale wouldn't be bad deal imo.

8711~~~
It would be the worst deal ever seen. He can barely run thesedays.

8712~~~
I would only consider taking Falcao from Monaco if they offered him for free. Even £1M is too much for this guy.
He has regressed as the season has wore on and I feel his peak was in Sept/Oct. 
He was abysmal in the recent U21 game, where he was subbed off for being so bad. 

For those who want us to buy him, can you give a logical explanation of why you think this?

8713~~~
feck it, I'll save you the wait...

"Has a face I like".

"There's just something about him I like".

"If he can even regain 80% of his past form it'll be worth it".

"Looked good in 10 second vine clip against Bahrain".

"Looked good in vine clip of penalty against Iran".

8714~~~
Spot on, all that nonsense is all over this thread, while hes laughing all the way to the bank

Really dont understand people at times

8715~~~
He could have scored four or five against Bahrain or something and I still wouldn't want him.

8716~~~
I don't think the door is completely shut, as far as the rest of this season is concerned. If the management think he's looking good in training and if the situation warrants it, he'll get his chance. I wouldn't want him here next season, though, unless the money is way less than what has been reported. I'd think of him as an above-average squad player at the moment, and even that is partly based on reputation.

8717~~~
That's the stupidest of them all. We're talking about an AS Monaco/Atletico Madrid player who had done almost nothing in the CL here. His first touch has always been a bit iffy and has not many weapons to beat defenders with. He came to Manchester to show he could make it to world class, but didn't.

8718~~~
That looks a terrible deal to me.

8719~~~
I'm not saying you are wrong, but what is your logic behind buying him for £20M - I genuinely would like to know.

8720~~~
I think he will be better next season if he stayed but his fee and wage demands will make staying impossible .
If he was on ,let's say, hernandes,s wages and bought for around 18 million Id take a punt .
Unfortunately it won't happen

8721~~~
You missed 'if he played at X, he'd absolutely smash 'em in'.

8722~~~
Yes! Dunno how I missed it.

8723~~~
You've also missed...

'If he had decent service and wasn't feeding on scraps he'd be banging them in!'

8724~~~
Logic was that if we could sell RvP for £20 million, and get Falcao of the same, and on less wages then I personally would see it as a good deal.

8725~~~
Watch him go to Juventus for a fee of 18 million. For some reason the Italians always manage to hammer the price down when it comes to bringing in the top players. Shaqiri, Vidal, Ibrahimovic. 

My thoughts on Falcao. The media have really exaggerated his loss of form. Yes he is not playing well but there are many factors that have contributed  to his slump and in the few games he has played, he has done well. I think his desire to try and make runs has been positive but his reading of the the pass a could be better. His hold up play is terrific, reminiscent of Van Nistelrooy. Its just the luck in the box has deserted him and his understanding of the players around him requires time and playing regularly. I believe no doubt he has lost some pace and maybe United would have known that beforehand had it not been a spontaneous signing.

8726~~~
We couldn't even beat a 10 man Villa under Lambert. Expect Vlaar to turn into Stam and have the game of his life.

8727~~~
"He's a good guy to have in the dressing room"

8728~~~
His hold up play has been rubbish. The ball keeps bouncing off him, and for someone so built physically he gets outmuscled a lot.

8729~~~
Some of you are funny. 

The joke that so many fans still think he'll make it if he's given a chance is so old now. The real joke here is you people who clearly don't rate him anymore (mostly justified, yes) but still feel the need to constantly come in here and make fun of and almost berate a player who still plays for this club. 

My opinion on the player or man doesn't matter. He could still have a big say on us qualifying for the champions league or he couldn't play another significant minute for our club. 

I'll support him while he plays for us and wish him luck if/when he leaves.

8730~~~
He not that built and I've seen him hold the ball up numerous times this season. Yeah maybe his first touch has been off at times but not like how your describing it. I've also seen Rooney have bad touches and been out powered off the ball pretty frequently so lets not be too bias here.

8731~~~
The funny thing is, in his first few games he actually played well, then he got injured and when he came back after that he was very poor, quite strange.
Anyway I think he will probably do well @ Juve, but I can't see a future for him here. Hopefully he gets a decent move and does well though, shame to see a good player not playing well.

8732~~~
True but that was when we were pretty dire ourselves, currently though we are in great form, we're playing at Home I just can't see anything but a  3 or 4- 0 win.

8733~~~
Yep. I was pretty encouraged early on, he looked very lively. But it just hasn't happened for him. I don't think he's necessarily finished completely, but at the top level he's nowhere near good enough. Would like to see him go to Italy or Spain and get some respectable figures again. Would Atletico take him back? Bearing in mind they've just taken on one ex-world class forward, (Which isn't exactly going well) and he wouldn't merit the wages he would've been earning in his first spell.

8734~~~

8735~~~
This is a week late but I got to see Falcao in action against Bahrain. Obviously we're a shit team but to me he did look sharp and was involved in the final third all the time. His finishing was good for the two goals he scored and had an assist too. I know its only against really poor teams but scoring in a match is never bad for a strikers ego and I really think hes recent issues have been because of his low confidence. I dont think he'll get back the explosiveness he had in Atletico but in these last 8 games he does have something to prove. He seems like a super nice and genuine guy not to mention he used to be one of the best strikers in the world. I hope somehow he does really well and if his asking price can be significantly lowered I wouldnt mind him staying.

8736~~~
Bahrain and Kuwait pffft.

8737~~~
Poor guy really is a shell of a player. So much for confidence gained by scoring for his country.

8738~~~
Smart distraction by him on the third goal.

8739~~~
He seems such a lovely guy, always smiling. Its a shame it hasn't worked out for him here.

8740~~~
Such an annoying sub. Comes on to lose the ball, leave us light in midfield and doesn't offer anything to the team with his lack of legs. I haven't once seen him influence a game. He's scored four scrappy goals and done f all else.

8741~~~
Maybe I'm harsh, but I'd rather we don't bring him on at all. If anyone is going to get these cameos, I'd rather it be Wilson.

8742~~~
Stop playing him. 

We're not keeping him so it serves no purpose. Just stop it.

8743~~~
The new Ade Akinbyi

8744~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  Why does this sound like a break up text at 2 am?

8745~~~
I hope someone makes a highlight reel of his involvements this match. That attempt at a finish, and then just falling over out of the blue when on the break. It's sad to see, but hard not to laugh <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

8746~~~
Not enough time to do anything. It did mean Rooney could play a bit deeper though which helps, as Rooney has shown to be pretty poor as a lone striker these last couple of games.

8747~~~
You'd have to feel sorry for him, that was a pretty awful cameo.
A mixture of trying too hard, no confidence and being rubbish.

I'd obviously love if he stayed here and got back to his best but I don't think that's going to happen. He should try Italy

8748~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> sorry lol, i just feel for him, he's got the heart but not the tools anymore.

8749~~~
When RVP comes back, I struggle to see how he'll fit in the matchday squad.

8750~~~
He's trying just way too hard. I feel sorry for him but he's a liability to play when we need goals now

8751~~~
He wasn't bad, just unlucky today. If Rooney hadn't controlled Di Maria's cross, Falcao was just behind him. Similar situation with the slip just before Herrera's second. People just need to chill out with him.

8752~~~
Even without RvP, it's completely pointless. 

He's not gonna add anything and we won't benefit from trying to play him into form when he's not gonna be here next season. 

Bring Wilson on if you want to add a striker.

8753~~~
What's the point, though? We aren't going to buy him and it's clear he isn't anywhere near his old level.

8754~~~
I know, I can't believe he didn't score a goal in 15 minutes of football in 4 games. Shocking player.

8755~~~
Well quite obviously the point is he's a quality player who plays for us at the present. Its irrelevant where he will be playing next year.

8756~~~
His best contribution was <b>not </b>touching the ball, so Herrera could score <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8757~~~
The volleyed effort and managing to fall on his arse during a break were not really indicative of a player in good form or confidence.

8758~~~
Strange decision to bring him on.  Like the guy but that doesn't make any difference.  Wilson would benefit much more from it.     
At least now we're playing decent football to brush over LVG's weird choices.

8759~~~
Would rather see Wilson or Januzaj given the gametime.

8760~~~
"Put Falcao in Rooney, What??!! He slipped."

Sums up his career here.

8761~~~
Its ironic really that a lot of his feck ups is him trying way too hard to do something, to score, to impress, to get games, to maybe get bought etc.
I'm not sticking up for him by the way, he hasn't been good enough. Its just that he obviously is trying to impress way too much and its backfiring big time.

8762~~~
Great to see the fans applauding him when he came on. Rather that, than booing the player who is totally shot of confidence.

8763~~~
He'll struggle to make the bench once Van Persie comes back. Think the only reason we're still keeping him involved is in case Rooney gets injured.

8764~~~
I want him to do well but I laughed at his volley.

8765~~~
Why do we still play him?  He come on and all I saw him do was lose possession on his first touch, then absolutely whiff a volley, and then slip and fall with nobody near him.  Was a good punt at the start of the season, now it is just a joke.  His agent can say all he wants but he has not shown anything to be playing at a top side any more.  We need to be giving time to players like Wilson to get them some more experience.

8766~~~
If he was already our player, i'd be saying that he will come back strong next season and have a good season because i do actually believe that. Thats not going to happen though and it is the right decision unfortunately.
I just hope he doesn't end up somewhere like Arsenal or any team in our league actually.

8767~~~
Looked awful when he came on.

8768~~~
Poor guy.

8769~~~
I hope he wasn't aiming for the goal with that volley because otherwise...

8770~~~
Should get an assist for the 3rd goal. Slipping and falling on his arse completely confused the defence.

8771~~~
What has he done for us this season to indicate he's a quality player?

8772~~~
He's been poor this year, but then none of our strikers have been brilliant this year. We know he's a top player and coming off a 2 goal international performance, Van Gaal probably wanted to continue building his confidence with a goal for club as well.

8773~~~
He got paid £250,000 for that 15 mins...

Lucky guy!

8774~~~
dont understand why are we still giving him play time? put him in U21 for the rest of the season if we cant terminate the loan.....

8775~~~
He <b>was</b> a class player who then got a very dangerous injury many fail to recover from. It's that simple really.

8776~~~
For a guy who is supposed to be crying himself to sleep he looked pretty happy today when he came on even if he only touched the ball 3 times.

8777~~~
Getting him on loan was the right thing to do. Unfortunately its not working out too well for him, but strangely I think next team he goes to will benefit from us helping him get back to fitness. 

I think a good preseason for him, no international tournament (Right?) and I bet the next team will be able to cross the ball lol

8778~~~
Him getting out of Herreras way  was one of his highlights this season. says a lot about his time here.

8779~~~
Actually it isn't since Van Gaal decided to play him after he did well during the break week. That's what's simple.

8780~~~
Any reason why that team shouldn't be us for the 2015/16 season? I know a lot of people on here don't want us to sign him of a permanent basis but if we can get him at a knock-down price, and bring in some young talent (Dybala?) then I'd keep him.

8781~~~
When we weren't getting joy in front of the goal, I actually posted that we should bring him on.  But I was hoping he could stay on his feet and at least kick the ball.

8782~~~
Price and wages seems the most obvious reason. He hasnt suited us so far unfortunately for him. Looks like we will go one up top and that man will be Rooney. Plus if we can get somebody younger for same price / less wages think we will go for that.

8783~~~
Because he's quite clearly done at anything reaching a remotely competitive level.

It would have to be less than £10m and even then I'd struggle to justify it, he's shite.

8784~~~
Surely we can negotiate for a more favourable price and wages package. If the player wants to stay, that's half the battle.

8785~~~
I really feel sorry for him. Looks like his confidence is shattered right now.

His best contribution today was when he decided not to touch the ball. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

8786~~~
I would rather see Wilson play than Falcao.

8787~~~
A fully fit Falcao would be an asset, but I can see why people are averse to us taking a punt for a permanent deal. Absent an injury to Rooney, Van Gaal won't start him before season's end either. Maybe it's curtains for his United career but I'd still like to see him, fully fit, being given a run of games.

8788~~~
He is fully fit.

Or at least as fully fit as he's going to be from now on. This is it, the knee injury has ruined him, lost him any agility, spring or pace that he had and it's ruined his head. Exactly like Torres.

8789~~~
If we cant sign a striker next season (and lose Hernandez) taking him on loan again might not be the worst thing, but still, id prefer seeing us give Wilson some chances as a sub.

8790~~~
Agree, especially during a period when the side are creating chances, as we are doing now. The problem is the timing of the situation and the need for Europe means nobody can, or is willing, to take the risk. I think we'll get a big knocked down price on him and keep him and unless I've forgotten most of the journalists at the time of his loan signing said it was essentially permanent anyway, so I don't see how that will have changed. There was some tax reason with Monaco why it was called a 'loan.'

8791~~~
So his confidence was rebuilt after scoring 3 for Columbia against pub opposition, but now it's crushed again?. No sorry he just isn't good enough anymore. 

That left footed air shot was ridiculous and he kept slipping everywhere, I don't get how his balance is so bad.

8792~~~
And it hasn't been a real world class player to begin with.

8793~~~
Just imagine all that wages on him...

8794~~~
I see nothing in his performances to keep him beyond the last whistle this season.  We would be playing a spin of roulette with £20M (or whatever) on the line when there is not one sign that he'll become the player he was.  And also when we're in need of signing quality midfielders and defenders.

Falcao came in at the last minute and has made almost no contribution to this team.  Wilson is our player and he offers a lot of speed that can be used for catching teams on the break.  van Persie will also be back at some point and I would easily play him over Falcao.

8795~~~
I laughed harder than I should have at that. It was a hilarious moment. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

What the feck was he even trying to do? Had enough to get the ball under control. And then the slip happened. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Got a feel for the guy. Needs another club, just won't happen for him here.

8796~~~
It's frustrating because we all know what he was capable of doing a few years ago. In hindsight after a severe injury it maybe wasn't the smartest move to play in the most physically demanding league he's likely to have played in. He needs to get his confidence back and I'm sure he can still be a really good player for someone. From our point of view in all honesty I'd rather see Januzaj coming on and getting some game time. Hopefully he can bang a few in for us in the remaining games I'd like to see him end his time on a high.

8797~~~
he's turned into last years Fellaini

8798~~~
What's the point of him coming on as a sub? I just don't see the logic in it (not that he was bad today).

We're not going to sign him and it makes more sense to give those valuable minutes to one of our younger players.

8799~~~
Which means next year he's going to tear up the league with us.

8800~~~
I think we're going to sign him.

8801~~~
We'd have to be mental to buy him now. Even if he was his old self I wouldn't pay £40m for him. He's 29 and has had two very bad knee injuries. It makes no sense.

8802~~~
... Haha?

Count me as another person who sees no point to even having him on the bench now. We're clearly not going tO have him next year so what's the point? These cameos make far more sense to give to Wilson.

8803~~~
He's absolutely hopeless. 

Now just a dreadful footballer.

8804~~~
That volley would have been a ridiculous shot to even get near the target, spooning that isn't indicative of anything.

8805~~~
Poor decision making? Stupidity? Or the fact that he's now a circus act...

8806~~~
Not that we are going to buy him but it wouldn't be £40mil anymore, it would probably be about £25mil or even less but with stipulations in case he came good again. Falcao would probably have to take a pretty big wage cut as well.

Its all academic anyway as its not happening.

8807~~~
Imagine if we had actually bought him. There would me be mass suicide

8808~~~
Anyone else confused why the crowd keeping singing that chant?

Herrera and Mata deserve something by way of a song.

8809~~~
it really says something when his best contribution is when he doesn't actually touch the ball. Doesn't he feel guilty at all for pocketing 250k a week or whatever it is For doing sweet F-all.

The most annoying thing is we've got Wilson not even getting a sniff of gametime. We are completely wasting those minutes on falcao a player that's not even going to be here and has no future at United. These 15 mins would be  better suited to help Wilsons development.

8810~~~
Score I think which is crazy when you think how low his confidence is and what he attempted.

8811~~~
I think it's just a case of the fans feeling sorry for how much he's declined and just want to give him support. Did the same for Di Maria too.

Also it's really fecking catchy.

8812~~~
Wilson or Januzaj should be getting on ahead of Falcao. It's not clear what LvG sees in him.

8813~~~
What happens when rvp comes back? I assume we keep this shape for as long as it works... So would we have both rvp and falcao on the bench? Seems unnecessary.

8814~~~
Why do people keep posting Wilson should be given a chance instead of Falcao when he's been out with a hamstring injury and no return date in sight?
Physio Room-J Wilson <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.physioroom.com/injuries/hip_and_thigh/hamstring_strain_sum.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hamstring Injury</a> no return date

8815~~~
RVP on the bench, Falcao left out is the logical option.  For some reason, I can see that not happening though.

8816~~~
I'll have to see it again but that volley didn't look like a shot to me. It looked like he was trying to work it back into the danger area. Obviously he was way off either way, but you lot are being a bit OTT in my opinion focussing on a mishit volley/pass.

8817~~~
Mata has a song and it was sung for large parts of the game, at least in our section.

8818~~~
I laughed at his volley. It's just sad now. There is no point bringing him on in games.

8819~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NjdBfUES1pw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Why does he get such a love in by still a fair amount of fans? He was a great striker at his past clubs. He's barely shown any resemblance to a competent striker for the most part here. Started off well enough but has got worse and worse. These two chaps seem to carry an agenda too as the less fashionable names who have performed well are being called to be dropped.

8820~~~
I want him to do well.  I would like for him to be able to leave United with a few more goals and with his head high.  I really feel for him.  You can tell he really wants it but nothing is coming off for him. I hate that we couldn't have gotten him before his injury.

8821~~~
To be brutal about it, we're not going to sign him, so we shouldn't be wasting our time playing him, unless we're really stuck for strikers. It just didn't work out. It happens. Provided LVG has the stomach to be ruthless with players like him - and history would suggest he does - then we just cut him loose, no muss, no fuss. And by the time the season starts I'll have forgotten I ever had to endure watching the useless sack of shit.*

*Shut up

8822~~~
He's barely even a footballer thesedays. Can barely run, or strike a ball cleanly. And he falls over all the time.

I do feel sorry for him, because it must be horrible, but injuries have destroyed him.

8823~~~
I still have faith that he will revive 'El Tigre' and score vital goals against City, Chelsea and the other remaining teams we face.

8824~~~
Same but I have had that feeling every week for the last 6 months.

8825~~~
It was a hard volley, you see players cock that sort of shot up a lot. If it wasn't Falcao it wouldn't even be mentioned. Rooney made a complete hash of an overhead kick in the first half. If that had been Falcao people would have been saying how sad it was. 

He's barely had any minutes recently, just making weak sub appearances where he's not presented with any chances. His international performances show he still knows how to find the net if you set him up properly. This team still struggles with creating chances for the strikers, even Rooney's goal today was a poor assist salvaged by a moment of brilliance, and the other two goals came from midfield. Falcao is still a top striker and he'll demonstrate that in a better team than ours. The problem is us not him.

8826~~~
feck injuries, man. Hell of a player in his prime, but Ronaldo, Torres, Van Nistelrooy and now Falcao? That's 4 of the worlds best significantly hampered, or even ruined in the case of two of those, by injuries.

8827~~~
Is the injury that bad that he genuinely can't move or lift his legs properly anymore?

That's what it looks like and explains his movements, his falling over and the continuous mishits of the ball. He's got the legs and balance of a newly born calf.

8828~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8829~~~
Fair enough I'll concede it's abit of both. You can't claim we're laying chances on a plate for anyone though. I'll enjoy the bemusement of our fans as he bangs them in every week for his next club and our lot ask why he wasn't doing it for us.

8830~~~
Because we don't play much against Bahrain or Kuwait?

8831~~~
Unless his next club is Rochdale, he won't be banging them in for anyone.

8832~~~
Snap. 

Don't get the constant negativity towards the guy. He comes on when the game is being played out and people give him shit for not scoring. His control is no worse than Rooney, who let's be honest has been rubbish last two games, lots of effort but no quality (except for the goal, today). Fellani today, absolute bollocks in comparison to last 4 or 5 games. See the same crap spouted about Rojo, and just don't see where people get their ideas from.

8833~~~
I know. He shouldn't have even tried to volley it. He was never going to score from that angle, he should have just brought the ball down.

8834~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>
This made me laugh hard. my stomach is still hurting.

I have an image of a calf coming out of a cow and stumbling around trying to get its balance.
Except this calf is a human with black, long hair and a red shirt.


And then he attempts this:




[/QUOTE]

8835~~~
Sure. But how do you explain the games where he actually started the match and gave poor performances? And when he (along with RVP) appeared to be hiding behind opposition defenders?


You sure about that?
Can Falcao do this:

8836~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0vwDzetfrA0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zBkuNpgACH0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

8837~~~
Said it before, when Rooney and Fellani played in midfield the front two did not get any service. Quite sure a fit Falcao and RVP would do well with the service this current midfield is providing.

Absolutely brilliant goal, but you didn't show Rooney's bicycle kick, which Falcao can do<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

8838~~~
This guy doesn't have enough confidence and I still have some doubt with his injury,he's not fit enough to play high level of football.

8839~~~
The standard or defending and goalkeeping in those internationals was very poor so I don't think that proved anything to be honest, clearly at times it has been tough playing up front for us but it's like that for pretty much every side in the league at times. Clearly though the big issue with falcao is the injury has affected his game and he hasn't been able to cope with the pace and physicality of the league, his first touch lets him down too often His confidence has plummeted. 

The issue is falcao and there is absolutely no doubt about that, I am sure there is a better player in there somewhere but it's also clear he is no longer the player he once was and it's a massive gamble for whoever signs him next because he could be another Torres or shevchenko.

8840~~~
Regardless of the money he's on, I have sympathy for him in the sense that he's being asked to fight for a lost cause by proving himself with cameos in matches that are effectively over. If LVG keeps using him this way, it's not going to get better for either party and I agree with those who say it's Wilson who should be getting what small amount of time Falcao is being given for the rest of the season.

8841~~~
there's kind of an obligation to keep him in the picture isn't there, with his status/wages and just seeing the season out respectfully as possible?. Monaco will get a serious reduction of transfer fee for his next move after being with us

8842~~~
Mata does have a song that was chanted plenty of times yesterday. He got a huge reception each time he took a corner as well.

I'm not surprised the fans are still on Falcao's side, he seems a nice guy and gives everything and to be honest in the short term fans don't want much more than that. Show you care and give 100% and fans will be on your side for a while. Forlan went nearly 30 games without a goal and the fans were always on his side.

He didn't even do much wrong yesterday (or when he came on against Liverpool) but I see so many comments that he was embarrasing, it doesn't make sense. That volley was incredibly difficult and it wouldn't have been mentioned if it was anyone else. Other than that I can't remember him misplacing a pass or doing anything that terrible. It is like Fellaini last season, the second he does something not right its highlighted.

8843~~~
I felt sorry for him for Anders second. He was wide open. I could hear him thinking:

"Yes! To me! Please, to me! Pass it! I'm open! I'm in the clear! Quick look I'm through pass to me for God sake man. Come on, oh for god sake I'm not in any more you're too late. Oh you've passed it to Ander, great. Oh that's a great finish, no that's fair enough actually I can't really complain about that. Good goal. feck my life."

8844~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8845~~~
I agree. Forums seasonally need a dog to kick. You'd have though people would have learnt from the Felliani and Young last season. 
I expect him to be here next season for an undisclosed fee.....

8846~~~
one brownie point I will give him is he genuinely seems delighted when someone else scores, even though he is having a mare of a time here. if you watch a lot of our goals this year RVP aint that bothered if it isn't him

8847~~~
I, too, can't help but think that we're going to make it permanent. He's been off the boil since he got injured back in October/November, where he wasn't as bad, yet we've continued to give him game time, which makes me think that we're thinking about getting him for a significantly reduced price.

8848~~~
I agree, 100%

8849~~~
He looks like a competition winner, everbody is playing at such a level that all you can do is fall on your arse and watch as the ball goes in the net.

8850~~~
Wilson is injured

8851~~~
Yeah... But why doesn't Wilson play ahead of Falcao?

8852~~~
There probably is an argument that an injured Wilson might be better than Falcao in fairness

8853~~~
Time will tell but there's nothing I've seen to suggest were are not. We paid 60m ADM and accept its gonna take him a season without the Falcao baggage. That kind of injury is a long recovery and rehab. Given when he was injured, rehab and no pre-season, and given he's hardly consistently had a run of games, when realistically did we expect to see a fully fit and firing player, this season....really!!!!

I tell you what, let's pay 6m in wages, handle sensitively his rehab and then at the end of the season, he'll be ready for his new club. That makes perfect sense.

8854~~~
Basically this. Its sad to see.

8855~~~
Buying him for 45m or whatever the fee is makes even less sense ater the season he has had.

No need to compound one mistake by making another one.

8856~~~
Januzaj then.

8857~~~
I'm not sure it will be 45m. I'm just not sure what we expected from the loan deal. I'm not saying he's been great cause clearly he hasn't but like I said, must be 9 months plus for that injury and rehab and no pre-season. Even then, you'd need to be playing regularly to get match fitness wouldn't you? That aside from getting to grips with the new league, manager, team, country........I'm no Falcao fan, just sometimes things take longer than we think and takes time. Most recently, Felliani, Young, Mata and even DDG show a little patience can go a long way....

8858~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8859~~~
Falcao did his rehabilitation at Monaco. I saw him play for them against Arsenal pre-season and he started some of their early league games before we signed him. If his problems were fitness related then you'd expect him to have improved throughout the season, he just got worse and worse.

Given his massive wages and reputation I suppose United thought they were getting a top centre forward but he has looked anything but. Personally I cannot think of a single reason why we would buy him permanently.

8860~~~
Exactly what I'm thinking. Surely we didn't think that he'd start scoring game in game out, when we bought him last summer. We'd have had an idea of the extent of the injury he suffered, and that it may take him a while to rediscover his form whilst fully recovering from the terrible injury. Besides, there's no way we'd be paying anywhere near 45 million, more like 15-20 as most other teams won't be willing to take the risk based on what they've seen; whereas, we maybe witnessing a much different Falcao in training, from which we may make our decision. I also don't think we're going to buy another young striker, such as Dybala or Lacazette, given we already have Wilson.

We'll find out very soon, regardless.

8861~~~
He seems like a bloody, thoroughly nice bloke and smiles when we score...?

8862~~~
Didn't get enough time to do much. Showed some terrible skills that belong far down the league system. I don't think he will ever come back to any sort of form. Absolutely awful from a player of that is suppose to be headhunted by the top clubs.

8863~~~
Haha - you must've felt like a smug hero doing that.

8864~~~
Such as?

8865~~~
That last kick close to the line that just went off to nowhere. A top player should not produce that sort of touch.

8866~~~
So you are saying that we should hire players based on their celebrations after our team scores a goal? Surely you cant be serious?
Perhaps I should play for Man Utd. I'll play for less money; I wont score; but I will celebrate even more enthusiastically than Falcao. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

Ronaldo (who scored 5 goals in 1 game over the weekend and whose goal tally in that 1 game, exceed Falcao's goal tally for his whole season) only seems to care if he scores a goal - I'd much rather have him in our team than Falcao.
We need to get rid of passengers, not commend them.

Some think that we will buy Falcao, which I doubt. LVG is currently benching the most expensive player in Britain, which shows how ruthless he is. I have no doubt that he will put an end to Falcao's Man Utd career.
LVG already stated that we do not have a 20 goal/season striker - this is the player he is looking for. Falcao is on 4 goals so far, which shows just how far Falcao needs to improve to even be in with a shout of being bought.

Another nail in his coffin was when he was subbed in the U21s game - LVG would have discussed Falcao with the U21s manager and this discussion would not have gone in Falcao's favour.

8867~~~
Class post. Probably far closer to the truth than we would like it to be.

8868~~~
good of you to half quote me, I never said sign falcao. its an observation of the chemistry of the players on the pitch, and the current lineup are buzzing around each other. (without falcao)

That alone is worth 40m. And that touch against sunderland.

8871~~~
Just checked his stats at the top of the page and to be honest I'm surprised he's managed to score as many as 4. I was thinking it was maybe 1 or 2. That is how desperately poor he's been.

All set up for a last minute Derby winner from him though isn't it?

8872~~~
Given how he always looks injured every game he played that's probably a fair assessment.

So do I.

8873~~~
Do you 'clearly love the club'?

And are you 'desperate to make it work'?

8874~~~
I'm actually a spy from Bluemoon.Good work Sherlock.

8875~~~
How come he's lost everything, I know injuries can do harm but he's been ridiculous.

8876~~~
Looked quite sharp in that new puma ad. Start him on saturday I'd say. He scored twice against Kun.

8877~~~
Imagine if Old Falcao suddenly showed up and tore Citeh a new arsehole. The Caf would implode.

That being said, i hardly think that will happen and i really wonder why he gets these 15 min cameos here and there. Is it out of courtesy or does the club seriously consider making the deal permanent? He seems like such a nice guy, and i have to admit i was giddy like a little girl when he came here, but looking back on his time here, he has been horrendous pretty much the whole time.

If he still has fitness issues then it's quite clear he is done as a top player and it would be madness to but him. If it's a mental thing, then he better snap out of it pretty damned fast or he'll end up somewhere else

8878~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Cant forget that touch.

8879~~~
lolololololololo
What a load of Bobbins
lololololololo, lololololololo
What a load of Bobbins

8880~~~
Haha, just happy this is not a serious post

8881~~~
Obviously this didn't work out. But if we were approached with a similar opportunity again I'd take it. End of the day it was only a monetary risk, his wages. If he worked out he would have probably won us around 10-15 points maybe? That would win us the title. Simple as that. Yes this risk did not work out, but when we signed him we were all thinking that potentially it would be Falcao spearheading us to the title.

Say in a few years time we have a similar deal for Aguero, coming off a bad injury, would you take it? Probably.

8882~~~
£4,000,000 a goal at the moment isn't it?

8883~~~
Value.

8884~~~
That touch against Sunderland is the equivalent of 10 goals and a baby goat.

8885~~~
I'm starting to think we're cursed signing South Americans <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Forlan
Kleberson
Veron
Falcao
Anderson
Heinze (debatably a success until he tried to move to Pool <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>)

AdM is struggling.

In fact, Possebon/Rafael/Fabio were cheap (youth) punts, so Valencia is the only "big" success (and he was EPL proven) signing I can think of. Unless I'm missing any?

8886~~~
Wait til we sign Messi! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8887~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8888~~~
Heinze was very good to be fair - the fact that he left under a cloud doesn't really change his good performances for us.

Also, Rojo's made a good start.

8889~~~
He's obviously not going to sign for us now so I'm not sure why we even bring him on instead of Januzaj who could use the opportunity to show what he can offer us for next season. I guess it's just to keep Mendes happy because its clearly not a footballing decision. 

It's going to take a brave club to buy Falcoa this summer.

8890~~~
i completely forgot about Januzaj's existence

8891~~~
Tevez was good to excellent for us. I still feel he shouldn't have been dropped when we signed Berbatov. Tevez was our most inform player the start of that season and he got rewarded by being thrown onto the bench.

8892~~~
Aargh forgot Rojo!

Yeah, didn't heinze get our POTY award his first year? Can't recall but yeah, he was a fan favorite at 1 point.

8893~~~
I'm forgetting all our Argies!!!

Yeah, in hindsight it was the wrong move by us.

8894~~~
Anderson wasn't given enough time to shine tbf

8895~~~
I thought he looked sharp and confident when he came on, as if he's feeling more settled or no longer feels the need to impress as he knows he's off anyway.

8896~~~
Pointless sub again.

A waste of a substitution.

8897~~~
I got that impression as well.

8898~~~
Still don't want him playing instead of the likes of Januzaj or Pereira.

8899~~~
Could've been slid in once by Di Maria and played a decent pull back. 

Looked more assured in his touches today. It does  look like he's playing with less pressure recently. Was decent v Liverpool as well.

8900~~~
What did you see that makes you say that? Genuine question.

I saw him nudged off the ball like usual and was too slow to keep up with the counter attack twice in 10 minutes.

Other than the offside pass to (I think) Rooney I saw nothing of a positive contribution.

8901~~~
Another nice little appearance fee.

8902~~~
Took the ball with a more confident touch than he has most of the season, made a good interchange with Herrera where he made a nice pull out run to the right and was played in, also had a decent turn and drive as well. I'm not suggesting anything miraculous, just that he looked less edgy and unsure of himself and more confident in his touch.

8903~~~
Would have rather seen Januzaj get those minutes tbh.

8904~~~
I think he has looked decent in his last few sub appearances.

8905~~~
His best performance for quite a while, didn't once see him trip over his own feet or anything.

8906~~~
He looked fresh and energetic, some very nice touches, plus he seem`d genuinely happy for each of our goals, I think we should sign him right away

8907~~~
I love how he's happy for our every goal. 

That's about it.

8908~~~
I honestly cant see him even being in the squad against chelsea. Rvp will be ready by then and can take his place on the bench. Having both is redundant.

Today's appearance should have been given to Januzaj or perhaps even nobody as a backup for an injury ala Carrick.

8909~~~
Why not just sign cheerleaders?

8910~~~
Is he any better than Hernandez?

8911~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8912~~~
LVG has been an angel so far regarding Falcao's treatment.If I were the gaffer he would not be anywhere near the first team by now.

8913~~~
Rubbish, bullshit and bollocks has he. If you don't believe me just ask Maradona.

8914~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px">Yeah, Maradona says</span> <span style="font-size: 15px">LVG is the devil!</span>

8915~~~
Interesting how many of you had the same opinions on Young and Felliani at the start of the season eh?

8916~~~
If you don't play very well then you're going to get called out on that. Your point isn't really interesting at all. If Young was still hiding like he was the seasons prior then he'd be getting stick.

Falcao has been dreadful and it's baffling to still see criticism in regards to his handling. The raw fact of the matter is that he isn't good enough to play here, not on this season's evidence.

The most surprising thing I find about Falcao and this strange move to Old Trafford has been how much I haven't cared about it all in the first place. I wasn't excited when he signed, I haven't had this burning desire to see him succeed like I've had with the other new recruits and I've been completely ambivalent to his time spent on the bench. Now that's not necessarily his fault, but as far as Falcao goes I just don't give much of a feck.

8917~~~
Not bothered whether it's interesting or not. Young and Felliani are here not cause the fans were patient but because the manager (whether luck or judgement) worked out how to use them. Whether you or others give a feck or not, like I said, a bit of patience and we might have a player that can contribute in the league and Europe.

8918~~~
He is 29 and will cost £40m. His best days in my opinion are behind him. Why not sign a younger striker with pace, which we lack.

8919~~~
I don't know what he will cost but it won't be £40 million anymore, there is no team that will pay that.

8920~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8921~~~
And that patience will cost the club over £40 million. For that money I want a forward that will win us the league next season and ensure that we challenge for the Champions League, not somebody that may or may not score a few more goals against Southampton or Hull.

He's done here.

8922~~~
The team needs competition as there will be a lull amongst certain players that are performing right now. However Falcao for the value we would have to pay for him isn't worth that. As others have pointed out we need a striker with pace who can stretch a defence.

8923~~~
Like Danny Welbeck????

8924~~~
The point I'm making is look back at the posts about Young and Felliani, things can change and I question without those two players form, we wouldn't be in the position we're in. Im not bothered whether we keep him or we don't, just some fans have little to no patience anymore, and the crystal for another forward, well who's to say they won't hit the ground running either? It's like we've learnt nothing from the Young, Felliani and even Mata experience, and those players weren't cheap either.

8925~~~
He actually looked like a reasonable footballer when he came on yesterday... didn't even get easily barged off the ball or anything.

I'd say "more of the same please" or something to that effect... but he's not our player, so I really don't care.

8926~~~
He is a good player, and I think as a sole striker he could do well for us. There's two factors we need to think of when thinking of Falcao. 

1. His best performances, and his most productive output comes when he is a sole striker with genuine width. For the first 2/3rds of the season, we played extremely narrow and with 2 up top. This won't get the best out of him.

2. He is/was coming back from an ACL injury, playing in, physically, the most demanding league. The PL isn't a walk in the park, and it's been a graveyard for some top European strikers (Shevchenko, Crespo, Soldado). Or maybe it's just a graveyard for strikers whose names end with an o.

Now, if, (and it's a big if), we were to play to Falcao's strength, I do think he'd be able to put up similar figures he put up for Porto, and Atleti.

Should we? I don't think so - and I don't think he'd want to stay in this league following this season either.

8927~~~
Honestly would rather sign Benteke for the money they want. Faster, stronger more suitable to the premier league.

8928~~~
Falcao has missed a few chances you would expect him to score. However, at the start of the season he was a victim of a very nervous United. He's not played well of late but I think he's probably genuinely gutted. He's in an awkward position. I think he did well when he came on. I think he would do well in this team at this tempo. He's been a bit unlucky. I still remember his debut when he had a great effort which hit the bar I think. Sums up his time here sadly.

8929~~~
In this system we only need the one striker and Rooney is our best, maybe he would play better in this system but there are not enough games left to give him that chance and rightly so we are playing well and it shouldn't be changed. He will be gone and i hope he does well wherever he goes as long as it's not in the PL, was a hell of a striker when he was at his best.

8930~~~
I hope the rumors about van Persie leaving are not true because the thought of him being here next season scares me a little bit.

8931~~~
I take your point. I think the difference is that we already own the likes of Young and Fellaini. Falcao we don't own, and I wouldn't like to buy him in the hope he recaptures form like others have.

I hope he does make a comeback somewhere else, though, as he was brilliant at his best and comes across as a proper professional.

8932~~~
I'm still not convinced that a decision has been made not to sign him.  He's still getting minutes despite there being no specific tactical need.  Similar to di Maria, it seems to me he is being brought on at the end of matches 1) to get back into form and 2) to analyze other potential lineups.  If he's been completely discarded then what's the point?

8933~~~
Neither will be here with any luck.

8934~~~
Sweet Lord you better be wrong.

Woodward (and the club in general) will look like complete mugs if he gets signed...

1. He's been utterly woeful and has done nothing to deserve a Manchester United striker's contract.
2. It'll be obvious that the deal was already agreed, thus was somewhat dodgy and all future loans will be viewed in a similar way by fans and press.

8935~~~
The manager doesn't care much for reputations, a player has to work his ass of in training and try very hard to understand all the lessons and instructions to have a chance to play the match or a part of it . That works both ways, LvG would lose a lot of his credibility towards the whole squad when he than suddenly would make 'political' decisions.

8936~~~
If LVG wants him that's fine with me. Happy to let the manager make the choice.

8937~~~
I doubt LVG will be foolish enough to sign Falcao.
LVG has already stated that he is looking for a 20 goal/season striker. Falcao has scored 4 goals this season (which is extremely low for a striker), so it will take a huge leap of faith to believe that Falcao will score 20 goals next season.
And dont forget that Falcao had a disasterous game when he was played in the U21 game, where the U21 manager took him off for being crap. That manager would've given LVG a detailed report of just how bad Falcao is.
When you consider that LVG's job could be on the line if he signs a lemon - I doubt he will risk it.

So, why is LVG giving Falcao cameo roles? Just in case Rooney, RVP AND Wilson are all injured, they need a striker to immediately take Rooney's place. My understanding is that RVP and Wilson are injured, meaning we are just 1 bad tackle (on Rooney) away, from being forced to play Falcao as our lone striker.

...and with regards to the theory of "a deal was done in principle last Summer" - I doubt this is the case, but even if it were the case Man Utd will probably pay an undisclosed compensation fee to Monaco and tell them to keep the player and cancel the agreement. Whatever happens, unless hell freezes over, Falcao wont be a in a UTD shirt next year.

8938~~~
I see your point but like others, could have been loaned out. In fact I think it's only felliani's injury that saved him. Tbh, it's going to be tough whether who ever comes in. Whats interesting is bar Blind, the success of the season is nothing to do with the £150m we spent this year. In fact the irony is it's as much to do with the players we signed the year before it. Even though they were familiar to the league, I think it takes a season to grow into the red shirt. This will be the same for even the players we buy this season who thought they played for a big club before they came here......

8939~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

8940~~~
Sounds like you are in agreement.  So basically Falcao is earning his minutes and not benefiting from any favoritism or pressure from the club hierarchy.

8941~~~
Maybe the pressure is there, but Van Gaal won't be pressurized. He had a comparable situation at Bayern, the club had decided that Germany's best goalkeeper Neuer had to play for Bayern, understandably, so they went out to buy him. That was not up to Van Gaal, but he in the meantime he played Kraft instead of Butt, because Van Gaal felt he had shown enough to deserve his place in the team. The board was afraid that Kraft would do well, and would gain more cult status among the fans, beeing from Bayern's own youth academy. Understandably they just wanted the old Butt naturally and necessarily replaced with Neuer.

But that's not Van Gaal's logic, philosophy even: You do well, he gives you a chance when he can, period. That's his message to all the players and youth players from the start, so for Van Gaal it's a matter of keeping his promise. Not just to an individual player, but to all the players. He will judge them on how they work and what they show.

8942~~~
Does anybody else get the feeling that he could go to the Championship and still struggle? he's been that bad.

8943~~~
I do. It seems many others are being swayed by 10 minutes where he didn't fall over or hit any air shots.

Didn't we see him getting casually bullied by League 1 defenders just a few months back? And by under 21 defenders just weeks ago?

8944~~~
With the lack of Carrick and Blind I can see Rooney being played as a CDM.

RVP has no match rhythm, Falcao has been getting minutes and Louis van Gaal even said he gave minutes to Rojo, Angel di Maria and Falcao because they worked hard in training all week.

Falcao I think might get a chance to win some fans over.

8945~~~
The least he can do is give us something good to remember him by.

8946~~~
Time to shine

8947~~~
I'm calling it. A Stamford bridge hat-trick <span style="color: #ffffff">of poor misses</span>

8948~~~
As long as he gets one he can miss 6. 

To do a poor miss he has to get himself in the right position so that's a good sign, he just needs to bury one of them!

8949~~~
This is really his moment. If he can do the business in this game he could really end this season on a high. Not sure whether it would make any difference in terms of whether he stays with us, but it would make a big difference as far as other clubs thinking about making an offer for him are concerned.

8950~~~
Right as he walks onto the pitch, feeling 10 feet tall, that this is his moment to shine, Giggsy sidles up, puts his arm around his shoulder, leans in and whispers softly "Don't feck this up, you useless sack of shit".

8951~~~
He thrives on being called a useless sack of shit. That's why Giggs would do that. He learned his excellent man management skills from the master, after all.

8952~~~
It's really sad watching this, its surreal to think that this guy was one of the most feared strikers in Europe who terrorized defences not too long ago. Now his confidence is so low that he looks out of his depth even against shittier lower league opponents...

It would be a sight to behold if we played a 4-3-3 with that Falcao in the video

8953~~~
Given that we've now seen the sort of package Falcao is smuggling, Giggsy would be doing well to tempt her away.

8954~~~
That's the disappointing thing, He actually just doesn't have the confidence to take them shots on anymore. Even if you cast your mind back to the ill fated Leicester game, that chance he had where he made something out of nothing, That was what made him so good originally and now he just won't try anything like that.

8955~~~
Part of the Falcao problem has been service.

8956~~~
If van Persie is an option I don't want Falcao playing to be honest.

8957~~~
Tomorrow is the day he has his "forlan" moment <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

8959~~~
He's been growing in a beard for the occasion.

8960~~~
What, he's going to struggle to get his shirt on in the dressing room?

8961~~~
In the Europa League that is, not in the CL.

8962~~~
Play him and we'll lose, he's that ineffective. 

Lovely chap though.

8963~~~
Oh please god do something for all the money we're paying you..

8964~~~
La Liga doesn't count then I take it?

8965~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cn9VvK0iLyo?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

If he can replicate this performance tomorrow, then there's no need to worry.

8966~~~
Hes going to struggle to get his shirt on after scoring the winner haha

8967~~~
Falcao's chance to contribute to the season and prove a lot of doubters wrong tomorrow, if Rooney drops into CM. Would like to see him get a chance to start the game.

8968~~~
Count for what? Not every player who has a couple of good seasons there is a world class player. It's not like Atletico couldn't do without him. I think he was a pretty good striker, but still had to prove himself at the highest level. Finally he got a chance, a chance he maybe should have had at a younger age, and didn't take it.

8969~~~
Will Falcao start then do we think?  Or RVP?

8970~~~
Rooney.

8971~~~
I thought he hinted that Rooney will be dropped into midfield?  If not, who plays there with Carrick / Blind out?

8972~~~
-------------------De Gea-------------
Valencia----Smalling---McNair-----Shaw
-------------------Herrera---------------
-----------Di Maria-------Fellaini-------
Mata-------------Rooney-------------Young

Or some variation. Keep Rooney out of the midfield, stick to the 'philosophy'.

8973~~~
If RVP's fully fit, I'd probably go with him to be honest. If we have any doubts as to his fitness though, then Falcao.

8974~~~
Would be a big mistake to start falcao, Chelsea defenders will be delighted to be up against him instead of Rooney and we should try to keep the front 3 together, the back four and midfield are going to be makeshift no matter who we play so priority should be to keep our forwards together.

It's a nice thought that he might play and roll back the years but the reality is if he does start he will spend 60-70 minutes running like his boots are weighed down, losing the ball and falling or being knocked over before getting subbed.

8975~~~
He was a fantastic, world class player.

8976~~~
This, a thousand times this.

If he does start I hope I'm proven wrong, but as it stands I really hope van Gaal keeps Rooney up top.

8977~~~
I'd start RvP over him, if need be. Wouldn't even have to think twice about doing that

8978~~~
Must admit if RVP coming back from injury starts over a fit Falcao, if there was any doubt whether he'll still be here after the end of the season, this would be the answer.....

8979~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This got me for some reason

8981~~~
@hirstclass 5m5 minutes ago
LVG asked earlier whether RVP would be fit to feature v #CFC: "No. He has to play matches. When you are injured you don’t use your muscles..

8982~~~
Have I missed something?

8983~~~
I think that we should borrow Fergie's nose on this. He would totally start Falcao. He destroyed Chelsea in the past and the stars are aligned for him. Mind you, Fergie's nose was responsible for that Park-Scholes-Giggs midfield that blew the 2011 title, but yeah, forget about that one!

8990~~~
So it looks like Falcao will start but his obscenely large penis is getting all the attention. Is this part of the feminisation of society?

Anyways, this could be the day for him.

8991~~~
Nice trainers.

8992~~~
They have got 14/14 right so far. So yeah. Falcao will start

8993~~~
I think he'll score if he does start.

8994~~~
Expecting a good performance from him today.

8995~~~
Will be interesting to see how he plays with the improved service from Mata and Young.

8996~~~
All will be forgiven if he bangs in the winner today.

8997~~~
Really hope he can prove to be a threat today.

8998~~~
The winners arse is going to be like a wizards sleeve if he does that.

Haven't really seen him since we started creating chances more frequently. Hopefully we give him a good amount of service.

9002~~~
Is that a iphone 6+?

9003~~~
Think hell be Vindicated today, he must know this is his ultimate and last chance to show what he's worth, wether it be for him to prove LvG that he should be signed or to help him get a a transfer elsewhere he has to be on it today, the optimist inside me thinks he will but I can also see it going to the 65th minute of him being bullied off the ball and getting subbed off, hoping for the first option.

Cmon Falcao !!

It's interesting that RvP declared himself fit for the City game and LvG said no and still wont even put him on the bench this week.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9009~~~
He has to be staying. I cant see why LVG would still have him on the bench every week and still be giving him minutes if he was sending him back. Give the sub appearances to Wilson otherwise, or even RVP.

Maybe there was something to the rumours about it not being a loan at all.

9010~~~
RVP has been injured and Wilson hasn't been good enough either. Don't think he is staying tbh

9011~~~
nope it doesn't. not when he plays in the prem. please see forlan and rossi for references. Thank you.

9012~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Wizards sleeve.

9013~~~
Come on Radamal, show us what you can do

9014~~~
So if he scores in this 1 game, regardless of all 'round performance, I take it we're then gonna clamour to sign him...?

9015~~~
lets hope he puts pressure on those two cb's and he and fellaini work together on those second ball in opportunities. (nothing to do with that photo , ffs he can pole vault to the grounds).

9016~~~
Who gives a shit what people will clamour to do.

Hopefully he scores and hopefully we win

9017~~~
For a person who hasn't posted one positive thing about Falcao, you do spend an awful lot of time in his performance thread...

9018~~~
He has been rubbish so far.

9019~~~
He's been better than Rooney last week and that was a foul on him for the goal. He's had one bad lay off, every other time he's controlled and passed it off.

9020~~~
He is pointless. Can't hold on to the ball, can't pass the ball.

Just get him off

9021~~~
Get him off now. Weak as a baby.

9022~~~
This is literally identical to Rooney's performance last week. Like Rooney wasn't losing the ball left right and centre vs City. Best performance under LvG. Well, if you use Gary Neville's logic.

9023~~~
A lot of mixed opinions so far tbh

It was a Clear foul in the build up to Chelsea's goal harsh to blame him for that

9024~~~
The worst striker i ever seen in the United shirt. Can't control one ball and falls on the ground everytime he is touched.

9025~~~
Harsh on Falcao. He's barely had any service.

9026~~~
He might have been fouled but that was a shit touch in the first place.

9027~~~
I give up now.

9028~~~
The falcao apologists are sad. The guy is no where near being a top class player anymore. The "foul" for the goal was tame compared to a challenge Valencia put in on hazard earlier (no foul given). Try having some strength and not getting pushed off the ball like a school boy. So he's made some very simple passes? Who cares. He also gave the ball a way in build up earlier (lucky it didn't lead to anything for chelsea) when all he had to do was the most basic of layoffs, but that's ok, he's made a ton of other simple passes! We should be playing Wilson not wasting a starting spot on trying to restore falcao' broken confidence. His agent must have some compromising pics of Woody or LVG...

9029~~~
If we can get any money back from the loan send him back. He's a waste of a shirt.

9030~~~
Any chance to lambast him though.

9031~~~
Peoples opinions were made before this match even started. He's done what was asked, and pretty much at all times had about 4 defensive players around him. Rooney was getting praised for this last week!

9032~~~
I think he's done okay. I also think he was unlucky not to get a foul in the buildup. Refs usually give that.

9033~~~
What really annoys me is he is continually making runs and pointing where he wants it and we are continually ignoring him. Hes not going to score if the only touches he gets are on the half way line.

9034~~~
He isn't do the same job Rooney did last week. He isn't doing any job or any<i>thing</i>.

I didn't want Falcao to start and I don't want him to finish. Dont think ADMs pace will do much here either. Perhaps Januzaj, and move Rooney up so we have a proper striker on the pitch.

9035~~~
Are you retarded? Rooney had Kompany or Dimechelis (sometimes both) up his arse for that entire game. That's why our midfield had so much space to do whatever they wanted - because Rooney was keeping the centrebacks so pre-occupied. Chelsea aren't even bothering to stick a man on Falcao because they know when he gets the ball he'll either (a) fall over, or (b) pass it to a man wearing blue.

9036~~~
He was fouled, and seemingly our only source of attack is Young and Fellaini crossing from the left to the first man.

Let's just rip into him though. Someone deserves it.

9037~~~
He doesn't do anything.

9038~~~
Agreed. We have our usual moaner brigade who already have their minds made up, then go matchday mistake shopping to validate their views.

9039~~~
Offers close to nothing. Always second to the ball, can't get a shot on target, easily outmuscled. Sad to say he just can't do it at Man U.

9040~~~
I've seen Heskey done better.

9041~~~
He's been fine today. I wish he'd get a chance, just give him the ball at his feet in the box. Chelsea away is a hell of a game for any centre forward, it has been for over a decade now. I can't imagine Rooney would have fared any better.

9042~~~
He is simply shit, no amount of playing time is going to restore him.

9043~~~
He was fouled for the goal for their goal. 

Won't be sad to see a switch though. 

Offered bare minimum up front.

9044~~~
Each player seems to have very different standards that they are judged by. No one is objective on Falcao.

9045~~~
Disappointing again, shadow of the player that murdered Cahill and Terry in the Super Cup.

9046~~~
This is what Rooney served up last week (and the week before...and the week before).

9047~~~
It wasn't a foul. He goes down in that situation every-single-time and hasn't gotten a single fk from the 2/3 dozen times hes done it.
Needs to be stronger, needs to make more effort to stay on his feet. He should have copped a long time ago that he wont get jack when he goes down that easy.

Dont mean to be harsh but seeing that happen every single time he plays gets really bloody old.

9048~~~
Our best chance came because their defenders were marking Falcao.

9049~~~
not particular surprised by his performance so far.

9050~~~
Not doing anything unless it's all off the ball stuff. The goal though was 100% foul, I don't know what world Gary Neville is living in when criticising him for not holding the ball up there. Terry has come right through the back of him and kicked him on the leg.

9051~~~
He was kicked by Terry. It was clear.

9052~~~
Dude, there's no need for that.

And if you can't see the similarity between this performance and Wayne's last week, then that's down on you. It also helps that Chelsea have effectively three centre backs playing.

He's done just as good for us as Wayne did last week. Not saying that's good as he's been average but it's not been nearly as bad as some of you lot are making it out to be.

9053~~~
No he's been bullied by John bloody Terry, his touch is awful and is clearly not on the same wave length as the rest of the team. Awful 45mins as a forward when we've been on top.

9054~~~
Yeah, I can't seem to recall when last he's had a decent chance as well. Pity though, he still needs to so much better protecting the ball.

Weve also been shit on the wings. Getting into good positions - but either pissing about and passing it back to the fullback or when we do decide it's time to cross, we hit it either straight at the front post or loop it out of play. 

Kin hell.

9055~~~
Agree with this completely. Although he does need to be stronger with his back to goal.

9056~~~
His touch definitely hasn't been awful

9057~~~
Agree with that. Some people find it hard to watch each game without fitting in their agendas somehow

9058~~~
Can't hold the ball up and repeatedly slips. He's not strong enough, I really hope that RVP can play the second half.

9059~~~
People see what they want to see. Chelsea are the toughest team to play in the league and they have gone super defensive today. It's no surprise we have created little, and what we did create came from space where Falcao pulled the defenders with him to leave Rooney with that shot.

9060~~~
This and the match day thread have become jokes, before he's even touched the ball people here have decided he's been shit. He's played better than Rooney did last week and the criticism he's been getting is pathetic, people are looking for chances to attack him.

9061~~~
Fellaini on Fabregas - foul
Terry on Falcao - he's not strong enough

Gary Neville's becoming more like Martin Tyler, every game.

9062~~~
Well that is not true at all.

9063~~~
Right... !

9064~~~
Thought he got fouled when he lost the ball for the goal. But I suppose they were never going to call that on JT lionheart.

Has been poor but lets not forget he is playing lone striker against the best defense in the league. Its going to be hard work for him to even touch the ball let alone score. We also need to be looking for him more often and not just keeping possession for the sake of it. Young and Valencia need to put in the crosses for Falcao to get on.

9065~~~
Souness constantly saying Man U. Prick.

9066~~~
He has lost the ball on a few occasions and gave away that dangerous freekick. Not great from him so far. His spat with Terry tells you that he is disappointed in himself.

9067~~~
The sharks are out and won't go back. 

He's done very little wrong.

9068~~~
It's just confirmation bias. People have decided he's crap, therefore they analyse his performances for things to criticise which will prove their point.

9069~~~
G.Neville is a prick.

9070~~~
Di Maria for Falcao please, Rooney back up top.

9071~~~
Definitely a foul.

9072~~~
Agreed

9073~~~
Mate it was a clear foul terry came right through the back of him even 

Even the dipper souness said it was

9074~~~
I must've imagined that arm in that back. The whole of sky's panel agree too. You're just looking to criticise him.

9075~~~
15 minutes to turn it around. Take him off if he doesn't do anything by an hour

9076~~~
People have already made up their minds before the game about Falcao's performance, it is pretty sad. He hasn't done much wrong but someone has to be scapegoated since we are a goal down.

9077~~~
He has been out muscled every time Chelsea get anywhere near him. We might as well play Wilson in there. Sure he's played some simple layoffs, but I'm sure Wilson can do that.

That goal we conceded was pathetic from him. I won't be surprised if he's subbed out in the second half.

9078~~~
He should've put that away.

9079~~~
He's been ok. Not sure why he's been abused

9080~~~
Souness, Henry and Redknapp all said it was a foul at half time.

9081~~~
Not effective so far as the lone striker

9082~~~
Couldn't agree more.

9083~~~
13/15 passes have been successful (86.7%), both misplaced ones were layoffs near the halfway line.

Fouled for their goal quite clearly. Hasn't had a shot whereas Rooney missed a very poor attempt by their standards (and given time he had coming onto the ball).

= Falcao is the worst player on the pitch.

Grip.

9084~~~
Left foot though, was difficult to take on first time. Thought it was in mind you, as did de Gea

9085~~~
Wasn't a foul

9086~~~
What did he say?

9087~~~
No it was by the rule of the game a foul.  No question but rarely given and you'd expect a so called 'tiger' and world class forward to be much stronger! Would Rooney have gone down there!?

9088~~~
He's been poor all game and needs to come off, I actually though he started his stint with us quite well, but for a while now he's been completely off the boil, there's no desire there, his minds already elsewhere.

9089~~~
Sounds like you in the Rooney thread any time of the year.

9090~~~
Judging Falcao differently than any other striker we have and that's been going on all season.

Is the Valencia thread being bumped for letting Hazard go past him or constanty dallying on the ball, slowing down our attacks?

Is Young's for not putting in one decent ball into the box? 

Is Mata's for some terrible corners?

No, Falcao's is for what? Giving the ball away once or twice and being fouled. 
If Rooney was doing it it shows he's up for the fight.

9091~~~
Nah, I've given Rooney credit when he deserved it, and last week his performance was awfully similiar to Falcao's today. Not great but doing a job.

9092~~~
No, hes given it away time and time again. Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story.

9093~~~
People are really harsh on him. He's done okay today.

9094~~~
For Falcao I feel it was an expression of his frustration, mostly with himself.

9095~~~
He's not been too bad and had little service but he was weak for their goal.

9096~~~
There's another replay. Clear foul.

9097~~~
Yes he would. He's already gone down for less.

9098~~~
YOu have to thread a ball or two behind the backline for him to have any sort of impact. Hoofing balls up aimed at him in the Premier League is a big no-no.

9099~~~
So what you're saying is he WAS fouled and rarely given? You're looking for reasons to criticise him.

9100~~~
He's been putting himself about all game. I think he realises this is a big chance for him today and he's doing what he can to take it. 

I'm not saying he's doing brilliantly, just that he's doing better than some are saying on here.

9101~~~
Nah man his passes were going nowhere, he misplaced all of them. I don't care what stats say or what actually happens on the pitch. I only care about my agenda

9102~~~
I agree.

Why are opinions always so extreme? I blame him for the goal, but he's done okay for most of the half.

If only RVP had been fit. I'd have liked to see him in the lone role.

9103~~~
What I am saying is i'd expect any United player to stay on their feet in that position it wasn't as if he couldn't stay up. Weak.

9104~~~
As I thought. This is one thing I really dislike about the premier league. If that is falcao or Di Maria it's not given. If it's Lampard or Rooney or Giggs it's a foul.

9105~~~
Maybe it was in this particular situation. If the ball goes into his feet with a defender behind him i expect him to drop on the floor and get nothing for it.
It happens a few times a match every time he plays. Im sure a few were fouls but hes not getting anything for it so i still wish he'd learn his lesson and stop going down so easy.

Its harsh and he hasn't played bad today, its just a pet peeve i have with him i guess.

9106~~~
But the example you used -Rooney, has already gone down for less in this game. Face it, you immediately took the chance to harass Falcao and now you've realised you've made a bit of a tit of yourself.

9107~~~
I'm no fan of Falcao he's been absolute dross since signing for us but in this particular game He's just a scapegoat. He really hasn't done much wrong and people are being waaaay to harsh.

9108~~~
Not at all. I have nothing against him and Rooney has not gone down for less. Fact is he's been poor and was at fault for the goal for being soft.

9109~~~
Wasted another fine chance. This is painful.

9110~~~
Wasted. Lol. You're painful.

9111~~~
Harsh.

9112~~~
Like fellaini just went down from Zouma challenge there? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> honestly.

9113~~~
So unlucky, awesome play.

9114~~~
Clear in on goal AGAIN. And our striker doesn't score.

9115~~~
Needs to at least hit the target from that close.

9116~~~
Inches away from vintage Falcao.

9117~~~
Now that was a situation where he couldn't stay on his feet.

9118~~~
It's sad to say but I've honestly never seen a player if such quality become so bad, so quickly.

He's obviously a confidence player.

9119~~~
I don't even need a rebuttal - he blew another chance right after your post. Just watch him try to score and "perform". He's ineffective.

9120~~~
I look forward to your posts in the Rooney thread for wasting chances as well.

9121~~~
How has he got 90 mins today? Utter shite.

9122~~~
Can't we both agree, that for this club to truly succeed, we need a more effective striker than we have seen? It's certainly not Falcao and it probably isn't Rooney.

We should hardly be surprised that Falcao has again failed to score or offer much of anything. I hope this is the last time we see him play.

9123~~~
I do agree with the first part. 

You're still overly harsh on Falcao as are a lot of people on here. And he offered more than Rooney did last week, today.

9124~~~
Hasn't been as bad as a lot of his other performances but not been good enough today either, offers very little to the team.

9125~~~
It's frustration - at seeing a once great player, a potentially great signing, who I really wanted to succeed, contribute so little.

9126~~~
Useless up front. Wouldn't out of place in Barnsley team, if he played there.

9127~~~
Done as well as he could really. Unlucky Cahill blocked that shot, and showed some of the old Falcao when he turned Zouma but the finish was a bit poor. We rarely looked for him all game.

9128~~~
He is shit. 

Strikers have been our biggest problem this season for me probably.

9129~~~
Absolute joke that he's played 90 minutes today.

9130~~~
Yeah he had a decent enough 2nd half. 
Dont think we need a scapegoat, wasn't a spectacular performance, the ball was a bit slow moving forward which shouldn't be a big surprise with the injuries, was by no means bad either though.

Chelsea played well, did a very good defensive job. Limited us to some crosses which they looked very comfortable with.

9131~~~
Actually thought he did ok. Certainly gave his all

But no way should we sign him still

9132~~~
Okay I'll put it out there. He was decent. Anybody that thinks he was useless is totally biased in my opinion.

9133~~~
We're all frustrated, I understand the frustration. But we should still be objective. 

We could say Rooney wasted our best chance and put an unmarked header over the bar. But we're ripping into Falcao for some good defending by Cahill and creating and missing a chance. 

That one where he hit the bar btw, at the near post from that angle I think what he went to do was the right thing. Smashing it high into the top corner.

9134~~~
What more could he have done really though. Chelsea were content with just defending all game and he didn't have any room to work with really, not to mention most of the time we just looked happy enough to play to the wings and keep the ball without trying anything penetrative. He was clearly fouled for the goal, so G NEV can shut up about that.

9135~~~
Courtois was well beaten anyway.

9136~~~
He tried, and really isn't that all that matters?

9137~~~
He was no better or worse than alright. The problem is that we've seen little else all season.

9138~~~
Can't seem to hold the ball up. too weak and slow. Let's really not sign him.

9139~~~
He did OK. One of his better performances for us, which doesn't say a great deal but still.

What I see is that he doesn't get the ball as much as he wants to - I don't think the team trusts him enough. Still, the Falcao of old would be brilliant in this side - unfortunately, I think it's best if he goes. I have no doubt if he joins a side that suits his style a little better, then we'll see some of his magic returning.

9140~~~
It's an amazing downfall, he's not even half the player he once was. 

Wasn't that bad today actually but given what we expected from him its just depressing to watch.

9141~~~
That's the main problem. If that's the best he could offer, he's not the answer.

9142~~~
At a certain point, trying isn't enough anymore.

9143~~~
Score? That chance when he was through he should have buried.

9144~~~
I honestly find it disgusting that this man is being paid £250k/week, or whatever it is.

He should be embarrassed to be getting paid that sort of money.

9145~~~
Dont think it would have mattered who was up top today. Don't see any future for Falcao here, but he's not to blame for the loss anyway.

9146~~~
Yes it would. It is strange to say it wouldn't matter, as if he's done the best EVERY striker could do.

9147~~~
It wasn't that easy. Could have done better if he played with more confidence. Rooney missed a good chance too remember.

9148~~~
Wouldn't want him ever starting again. Was so poor today, too weak with his back to goal and made it very easy for Chelsea's defenders. How he played 90 mins is beyond me.

9149~~~
It was a similar angle to Hazards and we all know how that ended.

9150~~~
Agreed. Thought he played well

9151~~~
All you can do is your best, what sort of message are we sending to our children of we criticise Falcao?

9152~~~
Should've scored his chance. Not worth the money though. We might as well have kept Hernandez. That guy never stops trying, us younger and actually scores goals.

9153~~~
He wasnt the worst player on the pitch.

9154~~~
Yeah, lets compare soon to be player of the year to shot of confidence Falcao when he gets his one good chance infront of goal in about 2 months.

9155~~~
When did he last score for us? January?

Think it was a bad idea to start him and a worse one to give him the full 90.

9156~~~
Same thing nearly every match. The lack of creativity of our central midfield makes our world class strikers look poor. Falcao got one through pass into the box all game. No-one even tried to link up with him centrally.

9157~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> try hard and getting paid 300k a week, while producing feck all?

9158~~~
It was a tighter angle than Hazard's and he had to hit it first time while Hazard took himself through and had time to pick his spot. Not the same.

He played alright. No worse than Rooney or Fellaini or Young.

9159~~~
He did OK today, but that isn't good enough to sign him in the long run. Benteke would have done a better job than him today, and that's saying something.
He has been a good professional but we need to cut out losses on this deal and move on.

9160~~~
Hazard isn't a striker and Falcao is. You asked could he have done more and the answer is yes.

9161~~~
Rooney was praised to the high heavens for having no attempts on goal against City. It's just what people want to see. Obviously I'd prefer Rooney up top but ripping into Falcao after today's game is completely daft.

9162~~~
Problem is that he's Falcao and is being paid an utter fortune. The expectation is understandably massive. 

Today he did alright and had he scored 15 goals this season we'd be saying that he was just unlucky. But overall this season he's done nothing to warrant blowing a massive bit of transfer budget on him.

9163~~~
For Falcao of old that's an easy chance, but I never believed he'd score his body language didn't indicate any belief. 

He played OK but considering who he is, what he is being paid every week, and what it'd cost to sign him permanently OK is not enough. 

This. Falcao has gone from being a match winner to a 6 out of 10 striker. Good enough but not amazing. It's sad but true. No doubt if Blind and Carrick are still out Van Persie will be back next week.

9164~~~
And a confident Falcao probably would have. Like I said, no confidence, no goals in months, barely plays and wont be signed. What did you expect? It was actually good to see him carve that chance for himself with a decent turn because nobody else was able to create much.

9165~~~
His runs are garbage. Once agian, he spent half his time hiding behind Chelsea players.

9166~~~
I'll try for 200k a week mate.

9167~~~
Not really fair to criticise considering how little football he's played recently so he's obviously not going to be sharp...

9168~~~
Just not good enough unfortunately.

9169~~~
The chance he created was great, I'll agree with you on that, but I'm not going to agree with you that he couldn't do anymore because he should have scored IMO.

9170~~~
I really feel sorry for the lad but it's just not working with him at our club. Would have been a great game for him today if he had scored with that shot in the second half but it's just not really going right for him atm.

9171~~~
Well yeah, old Falcao probably would have. He was better today than in his last games for us but it was a difficult game for any centre forward when you see very little of the ball.

9172~~~
Falcao's pressing today was so lazy, slow and had absolutely no intent. It was shocking. I'm really surprised how many people aren't noting this. 

He has no <i><b>presence</b></i> between the opposition CBs - he's no bother to deal with.

Anyone who thinks Falcao's performance today was comparable to Rooney's against City must be deluded.

9173~~~
Against the meanest defence in the league no less. 

We've written loads of players off here that have come back to prove us wrong, but to me Falcao needs a new club and a new start.

9174~~~
I'm not being critical here of his whole performance. I agree the ball didn't come his way that much in the game and I'm not here slating him saying he played shite blah, blah, blah. I just feel he should have buried that chance, so he could have done more.

9175~~~
He had one chance that he should have buried, but there's no way Rooney would have made that run in the first place.

9176~~~
Let's just not sign this guy under any circumstances.

9177~~~
Exactly, he has very little match fitness.

I like the guy but he doesn't deserve to stay based on what we've seen so far unless the fee wages are more reasonable than the extraordinary figures we see quoted all the time.

I'd like to see him with a nice run in the team up top on his own.

9178~~~
Made some decent runs and tried hard enough I felt, got into a couple of good goal scoring positions but it wasn't to be. The big issue is that he doesn't press and harass the CB's the way Rooney has been doing in that role.

9179~~~
Copy and paste? Pressing? Pressing who? We had the ball for 75% of the game and passed it to the wings/backwards 9 times out of 10. He put in a shift, like Rooney did last week. Saw barely any of the ball and wasted a good chance he created with a decent turn after getting about 5 touches the whole second half. No it's not good enough for us but acting as if he was a total disaster is just clear bias.

9180~~~
Can't fault him for effort.

9181~~~
He didn't do too badly I thought. The two times that he did get good service, he has a shot blocked and a shot hitting the post.

Still not worth buying though.

9182~~~
He's done at United. There might still be a quality player in there somewhere but we can't afford to give him enough games to find his form again. 

Hope he can do well somewhere else, good luck to him.

9183~~~
Amazed he wasn't subbed. I was convinced di Maria was going to come on for him, push Rooney up top, with di Maria in the midfield 3.

9184~~~
Some of the criticism in the matchday forum was OTT but that should be his last start here. He just doesn't have any standout qualities at this level.

9185~~~
It's amazing that his pressing was so ineffective and yet we recovered possession over and over and over again. So either it wasn't quite as bad as you think or it wasn't necessary because we dominated regardless. I reckon you'd be amazed at how similar their performances were if someone actually bothered to do a side-by-side comparison.

9186~~~
The way he put Courtois on the floor was world class, very unlucky with that chance.

9187~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> now I know you're taking the piss

9188~~~
No, you're both wrong. The amount of times that Terry, Cahill or Courtois had completely unpressured possession while he ambled around in front of them was shocking. 

He looked unfit and uninterested in pressing or winning the ball back at all.

And before you wade in bleating about me being biased against him, please note, I don't think he 'should've buried that 1 on 1', or pulled a miracle out of nowhere like lots of the 'anti-Falcao' posters are saying. Not at all.

His performance today and Rooney's against City were very different and a side by side comparison would show this.

9189~~~
Certainly comparable to Rooney vs City -- a couple of differences:
Falcao lost the ball a little less, Rooney pressed a little better. Was fouled for their goal. The chance off the post was tough but not impossible.

9190~~~
Thought he was okay, didn't do much right or wrong. Looks more like a 10m signing for a 40m one. 

He's strong and puts himself about but was never going to cause much hassle in the very cramped chelsea peno box

9191~~~
Some really shite posts in this thread. Did as good a job as you can expect given the circumstances.  Would have no issues with him starting again next week.

9192~~~
He reminds me of RVN and Inzaghi in their prime, with less pace and none of their finishing style.

9193~~~
Did as good a job as you'd expect based on what we have seen this year. He tried and there were a couple of nice touches but he certainly did not look like someone you would break the bank for.

9194~~~
LOL.
I'll try for £150k/week.
And I'll score the same number of goals as Falcao. Zero.

9195~~~
Surely a piss take?

The list of things the man cannot do includes:

Control a ball.
Receive a ball with back to goal, hold off a defender and give a pass away (this one is key as this is what he attempts to do 97.8% of the time).
Win any type of physical challenge.
Run effective lines.
Create chances.
Score chances.
Maintain a presence up front.
Get on the end of crosses.
Close or press defenders and keepers.

He is not premier league quality anymore.
I'm not convinced he's even championship quality. Obviously he was, but no longer.

There are strikers playing for teams at the bottom of this league, and top of the one below, who with the dominance of the rest of our side today, would have earned us at least a point. He was awful, and not for the first, second, third or fifth time this season.

9196~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Do you have anything to qualify that opinion? Or shall we just take your word for it as a football guru?

A bit like this, you mean?

<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x2n3yco?width=500&amp;hideInfos=1" width="500"></iframe>

9197~~~
I'm not going to judge him based on what we might have to sign him for. 

I thought he did a very good job. Couldn't have done anything more given he had zero service from our wide players.

He's had plenty of dogshite games but this was not one of them. Anyone having a go at for this performance clearly has an agenda.

9198~~~
He was actually better then what I expected (which was totally rock bottom levels of shitness) - at times his touch and pass was fine and his darts in close areas were good. The problem for me was that, in general, again his runs are really poor. He spends a lot of time hiding behind opposition players, not really doing anything to make the space for himself... which completely removes him as an outlet for periods of the game.

He also should have scored his chance - big game like this that's as good a chance as you're going to get.

9199~~~
Some absolute made up rubbish in here. People seeing what they want to see. He's hardly at his sparkling best and I'd definitely play Rooney ahead of him, but to pretend he did his job today any worse than Rooney last week is just wrong. The difference is you're playing against a side set up to defend. There was literally no chance of us catching them in transition today, because as soon as they lose the ball it's all hands on cocks

9200~~~
Don't think he was bad today. Bit laboured on the ball, I'll give you that. Made a couple of good runs at the end, and was unlucky his shot came off the bar, from a very difficult position.

9201~~~
Certainly wasn't as bad as some are making him out to be. Rooney had what, 35 touches against City? Similar performance. Looked sharper than before but having said that, would not sign him for 40mn. I'd have him for 10mn though, just can't shake this feeling off that he's just one goal away from returning to the Falcao of the old. Silly romanticism.

9202~~~
He wasn’t bad today. He just doesn’t offer enough to start for us, and sometimes it feels like it’s too hard for him in this league.

It’s really easy to understand why most top teams don’t play classic no9.

9203~~~
How did he hit the post.. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

9204~~~
I wouldn't class that as unlucky - I mean it was the outside of the post, so really not <i>that</i> close to going in (in post terms at least)... it was a very good chance, and the position wasn't that difficult. It was a decent effort but in a game like this you want a bit better than decent.

9205~~~
This! 

He looked tired at a point before half time. He doesn't create space, Chelsea were actively not even marking him much and in the second half when he got the ball he couldn't put it away. I've seen much better from him in previous games but this game he was real tosh to be honest.

9206~~~
I understand what you are saying (he had a tough job today if we take this match in isolation) but, as a loanee with an extravagantly priced buy option that is exercisable soon, he is unfortunately playing a succession of trials and he did not pass today.

9207~~~
Yeah, I suppose that's what separates the good enough from the great. You just feel RvP would've buried it.

9208~~~
Agreed. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9209~~~
maybe his game does not suit the premier league or maybe hes just bobbins

9210~~~
I disagree with you.

I don't paint myself as a football guru, but nor do I view you as one <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

9211~~~
Possibly because he has a wand of a left foot.

9212~~~
Lone striker playing against a 5 man defence....yeah he was awful. Smh

9213~~~
He wasn't that bad today, thought it was an decent/OK performance, almost got the equaliser too. Hardly gave the ball away, mostly held it up ok and passed it on well. Unfortunate with the foul that led to the goal too

9214~~~
Considering how little footy his played he did well, they have a solid defence to so you have to take that into consideration.

Disappointed he didn't put his chance away but you could argue it was because of lack of game time, brilliant run though!

9215~~~
Was never, ever gonna score that chance. Old Falcao probably would've though.

9216~~~
1 thing I have never really noticed, but he looked REALLY small today, even body wise, he looked almost skinny?. Has he lost a lot of muscle mass since his hayday.

9217~~~
Excellent stuff. This is what discussion forum's are all about, really. Arrogantly dismissing other people's opinions, ignoring any relevant counter-points (e.g. very pertinent Rooney video) and then side-stepping the discussion entirely to protect a bizarre agenda. You gotta love it.

9218~~~
And you've take the crap out of context. Please show a clip when we are pressing, I clearly remember two city defenders on Rooney at a stage. Chelsea had no such fear, they had one person on Falcao, sometimes. They mostly allowed him to roam around on his own and he got chances in the second half but they still didn't feel enough to have someone on him constantly.

9219~~~
In the role and game today, thought he did well up top, couldnt imagine any of our strikers out of form burying that shot.

<a class="username" data-user="56592, @Annihilate Now!" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/56592/">@Annihilate Now!</a> 

Very unfair, he was running at pace with a man on and still got a shot away from quite a narrow angle, would have beat the keeper if it was 3 inches inside. RVP as a lot claim, would NOT have buried it, they compare against an in form RVP, an in form Falcao is capable of scoring it too. Considering his past form against Cahill and Terry, thought he did well, seems to link up with Di Maria better than anyone too IMO

9220~~~
Ive knocked at that particular door without ever an answer

9221~~~
We are pressing. Valencia wins the ball back and squeezes the midfield along with Mata and Fellaini, and it's left to Rooney to press the defenders. He does that but doesn't exert too much energy and consequently Kompany, Demichelis and Zabaleta are able to pass it around the back to start a move which ultimately ends in a goal. If Falcao did that he'd be slaughtered, we'd see a dozen replays and Gary Neville would analyse it to the nth degree to show how Falcao simply isn't doing enough as a striker.

If you wanted me to I could show you Falcao pressing the ball better, or withstanding pressure from two defenders and laying it off, or show Rooney losing the ball feebly just inside his own half. All of these things happened. It's just what people remember that shapes their opinion overall. Naturally agendas and emotional attachment to players play a very big role in this.

9222~~~
I'm not sure about his lack of runs being the problem. Fact is, we don't create enough chances. We didn't when RVP was up top. Not when Rooney was up top and not today. That suggests the problem is with our creative players not strikers. Young's final ball is erratic at best, Mata doesn't create much or anything. More of a goalscorer not a creator. Di Maria has been shite for a while. Our LB's have been our most creative players of late.

9223~~~
Did ok today.

9224~~~
Can't believe some of the comments here.

How people are suggesting he played well, or was no worse than Rooney last week is beyond me.

We had 70% possession and he touched the ball 32 times. 
Of that paltry 32, he had 3 shots. 0 of those 3 were on target.
Of the other 29 touches, he directly gave possession away 10 times, either by failure to control it, or with a misplaced pass.

Of the remaining 19 touches, I recall at least 2 bad passes (and I'd have to look back again for more) which did find a red shirt, but led to immediate pressure and loss of the ball.

He made 0 dribbles. Won 0 free kicks. Created no real chances for anyone else and didn't hold the ball well.

Hell Drogba is 108 years old and was pants, but at least he ran at us a bit, held the ball up and won a couple of free kicks.

9225~~~
To be fair and honest, Brwned, your reply to me was rude and dismissive - a green smiley, a nasty comment and a 40 second clip that has no context to what we're talking about. This is your usual approach whenever we engage, fair enough, but I've not been arrogant toward you - I just don't agree with your opinion here.

What is there to side-step? Rooney spent the entire City game pressing and pinning his CBs and was praised at length by Nev and Carra on MNF for it with footage highlighting his effectiveness.

You might not agree with me, or them, but objectively speaking, they know way more about football than you - even if I don't!

I've been honest about my opinions on Falcao today, it isn't agenda posting just because I don't think we should sign him.

9226~~~
And yet we saw plenty of the same from Falcao today. Yet Rooney, when we were attacking against City almost always had a player on him or drew players with him leaving space for others.
Falcao did nothing of the sort and Chelsea even felt strong enough to allow him alone with no one on him during a lot of the game.

1) That Rooney shot at the beginning of the game, watch Falcao. There's a defender on him as he runs  ahead of Rooney while the ball is coming through on the left. The defender actually allows Falcao to run on into open space and stops because he becomes aware that Rooney is a more dangerous threat.

2) Falcao's first shot at goal. Chelsea aren't marking him at all and allow him to roam around till he gets the ball and shots/slips and the ball goes wide.

3) Falcao's second shot. Again, Falcao runs around without someone marking him. He isn't a threat to them and he gets the ball and only then does a Chelsea defender start closing him down before he takes a show and misses. He should have scored this one in my opinion.

I didn't watch the rest of the game once Shaw was replaced. Knew we wouldn't score.

9227~~~
To me this was a very bad performance. And if you look at the quality this man is supposed to have - it's fecking awful. What do we expect of the mega stars of this world? A guy like this is suppose to cause constant danger. I mean, when you have a guy like Etoó, Ronaldinho, Kaka, Pirlo, Messi, Müller, Ribery, Robben etc, all of whom are mega stars, you expect them to raise the roof whenever they are in contact with the ball. Falcao is not even an average attacker in the PL. It's so awful it makes me want to puke that we actually gave him a start today. I think we would have been better off with having one more body in midfield and let Rooney play a free role between midfield and attack. 

It's about time we stop dreaming about this gentleman. No need to be rude or anything, just let him have a rest and return quietly to Monaco. There will always be a new club for him. To let him play is nothing but a waste of time - for everyone involved. Thanks for your time and devotion. I'm not complaning about your attitude, it's just that you're not good enough for this club right now. I wish you all the best Falcao.

9228~~~
Liverpool are apparently interested in buying him. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

That's the only good news.

9229~~~
I'd describe it as quite simply laughing off you being rude and dismissive, personally. You're the one that told us we were wrong. Simple as that.

What Neville did was throw three (?) clips together to paint a narrative that his audience wanted to hear. Firstly it was showing something that the cameras couldn't see - even something <i>he</i> couldn't see, the great Gary Neville - so it must be some really key insight, it's real added value stuff, the kind of analysis that only a premium sports broadcaster like Sky and their #1 pundit could give you. Secondly it was a positive story that went against the grain about England's #1 player, Manchester United's captain, and therefore a player that the British audience are always interested to hear about.

You could throw three clips together to paint an entirely different story, a story that Rooney's touch, his hold-up play and his all-round contribution was simply not up to scratch. It's the kind of story that a lot of people would've agreed with and would've posted on here and used as evidence of his drop on form over the past few weeks, so it would've engaged the audience, but it wouldn't have had that added value factor. That's all there was to it, IMO. I could throw together those three clips now to paint a very different story but you would just dismiss it, you see.

Football really isn't rocket science. You don't need to have played the game at the highest level to understand it (ask Sacchi), and you don't need to have been involved at the top level to recognise whether someone has played well.

9230~~~
If he was available on a free transfer (but still £200K p/w wages), would anyone want him? I don't think I would if I was a United fan.

9231~~~
Well put.

9232~~~
Nope. Would rather have Ings on a free to be honest.

9233~~~
He's useless so no.

9234~~~
Well said. Rooney was getting slaughtered on here until Neville pulled a few clips together, now he's amazing (again) and everyone is satisfied with his role in recent games.

9235~~~
Bull, I hadn't even seen GN's broadcast until two days ago and I had seen Rooney pulling players with him all over the place including having two mark him. Did GN ever say that Rooney was marked by two players at times? No! Yet I picked it up watching the game, just as everyone else had. 

Don't need GN to explain things when it's clear to see, well to some of us anyway.

Falcao though was pants. I also don't need GN to tell me that. I saw it.

9236~~~
What if Gary Neville said he was fantastic today?

ConspiracyKeanu.jpeg

9237~~~
I wouldn't pursue it myself, no.

9238~~~
Unlucky not to score today though.

9239~~~
He was better today than he has been for a while. Still certainly not good enough, but he wasn't terrible.

9240~~~
Think we're just gonna have to agree to disagree.

I felt Rooney's performance against City was a world apart from Falcao's today - constant, insistent pressing that pinned back the CBs and created space for the midfield to exploit.

Falcao's pressing and hassling today was non-existant to the point that he became a non-entity for Terry, Cahill and Courtois.

I agree with you that you don't need to've played at a high level to understand the game, but Neville and Carragher are the best pundits (on the PL) I'm sure you'll agree, and what you're saying about Neville's 'pro-Rooney' agenda is basically a conspiracy theory that I don't buy into.

You do have a great knowledge of European and World football, far beyond mine, but on this I disagree with you and I think you're in the wrong to suggest Falcao's performance today was comparable with Rooney's against City.

9241~~~
Before the Chelsea match people were saying this guy is going to score. Some were saying he'd score a hat-trick.
I retorted that there is greater chance of me winning the lottery than him scoring a hat-trick in the EPL.

<b>I am highly critical of Falcao, but in today's game, he didnt play badly, just average.</b> Certainly not good enough to be one of the highest paid footballers in the World.
I've said this before though, playing with him in your team is like playing with 10 men. I'd rather see Smalling up front than Falcao - he is barely able to out-muscle teenagers, let alone grown men and unfortunately for him, the EPL is arguably the most physical of all leagues, so EPL just doesnt suit him.

The other thing is that for his own sake (and his career), he needs to stop playing for Man Utd because with every game, he just confirms that he no longer possesses the ability which allowed him to score super-goals.
If I were him, I'd return back to Monaco immediately and plot the next career move.

And with regards Liverpool buying him - I felt Rodgers deserved a slap on the head for buying Balotelli. If he buys Falcao, he deserves to be sectioned.

9242~~~
Well then I would disagree.

9243~~~
Just thought that if (fit) Sturridge were there instead of him, our score would be better.

9244~~~
Again his shot wasn't unlucky, he should have hit the target (and scored really).

9245~~~
He did ok and was unlucky not to score today. I just think the physicality of the Premier League does not suit his game.

9246~~~
Agreed.

Regarding the second shot, there was a rather huge gap Courtois left open and he should really have scored.

His first shot was unlucky(with the slip).

9247~~~
He did ok but we didnt play anything like we have the last few games and thats not his fault. The crosses werent coming in for him at all and thats down to us missing players.

Thought he should have done better with his chance though. He did the keeper but didnt hit the target (outside of post).

The block by Cahill was great movement though, just a shame it was really good defending by Cahill.

9248~~~
Just wait for Gary Neville's analysis on his performance.

We'll all be willing to chip in for his wage.

9249~~~
Someone explain to me Why would a player of Falcao's stature come to OT for a trial? (Call it a loan, still means the same thing in this case). If Falcao was brilliant, there was still no guarantees that he was going to stay anyway then if that's the case. Can you imagine, he scores 40 goals for us, we say yes, Falcao says no thank you, I'm off to Real......and that's why it makes no sense.
It's not he needed the money or that he was joining Barca or Real. It's not like he wanted champs league or a platform to kickstart his international career again.....and it's certainly not for the culture, restaurants or the weather. The only logic I see is we have provisionally signed him already with the outstanding issue of the fee.....

9250~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 160 posts in a thread about a player clearly not liked - agenda

9251~~~
We were originally going to buy him outright. Forgot how this became a loan deal, though.

9252~~~
I do hope not. I was in favour at the time but it's just not worked out.

9253~~~
This.

I'm still raging at the breakaway chance he missed when he smacked that ball against the outside of the post after he fooled Courtois completely. That's the kind of chance a player of his calibre can't afford to miss so many times like he did this season.

9254~~~
He was anonymous for much of the first half, in fact I forgot he was playing until he eventually got a touch well into the half.

9255~~~
Whereas it is OK for Rooney to miss two sitters yet not a word against him. RVP has been missing sitters for last 2 years. 

Falcao created that opportunity with his movement. His only fault today was not standing up to the tackles from behind by Terry and Cahill.

9256~~~
I think it's because we wanted the transfer fee to come out of this years budget and not last years? The only issue I believe is has he physically fully recovered from the injury and nothing to do with his football ability.

9257~~~
He had to drop back to get a touch of the ball because his constant movement up front was being completely ignored. Mata, Herrera and Rooney were pre-occupied with back, side and wing passes. This results in a good percentage of possession but starves our strikers.

9258~~~
Because Monaco didn't want to sell James and Falcao in the same window as it helps their FFP. I think.

9259~~~
Yep, I thought the service into the box was quite bad. A few more decent crosses and he may have had a chance.

9260~~~
Falcao managed to become easily the successor of Fellaini as the <b>Knight of the Sad Countenance</b>. Whenever something goes wrong or doesn't work out, he seems to be the symbol of the process.

If we sign him for reasons beyond comprehension, let's hope he does what Fellaini did in his second season with us. Falcao 2.0? Well, I lack the faith to believe. And if we sign players for these sums, we will also lack money sooner or later.

9261~~~
I only got to watch the match up until right before the goal unfortunately, due to family obligations, but there were a couple of times up until I stopped watching where it looked like Falcao had glue on the soles of his shoes. He just couldn't get around fast enough to apply any sort of pressure to their defender's on the ball, and in those situations just showing yourself makes a difference.

Without comparing him to anyone, I just don't think he has the legs to play up front with the style we are playing, that relies heavily on the striker to be mobile enough to show himself for both centre backs when on the ball. Other than that, he looked better than what I've seen so far from him on the ball, but that moment when he lost the ball for the goal really looked like something that's become a bit too familiar when seeing him this season.

No idea how he did in the second half, obviously, but in sum I think it's clear that he just isn't capable of producing what we'd expect given his name and stature, wages and potential transfer fee, and we'd be much better off trying to find someone else to fill the role he's currently occupying in the squad.

9262~~~
I was convinced he was going to score it. He took the pass well and made the space for the shot - had the right idea going near post too. Just sliced it.

I'm convinced he's just not handling the pressure of playing for us. Just seems he panics every time he touches the ball at times - or that he's just trying too hard. Slices shots, slips when he shoots, over/under hits passes.

It's unfortunate.

9263~~~
Might be right. Like I said I not sure what Falcao or Monaco had to gain from the loan deal. Why would Utd sell Welbeck to accommodate Falcao cause clearly selling him had nothing to do with Wilsons development.

Again, if he was brilliant, what was stopping Monaco saying, we are keeping him after the loan move? Or someone offering more money? 

Are we suggesting that Monaco are that stupid that they are going to loan a player that if it doesn't work out, is going to be worth less than the value before it.

9264~~~
If we owned him outright I'd be up for giving him a second season, but we don't. It's a pity, but he has lost his confidence and he won't get it back here.

I hate to compare the two, but I think Welbeck would have been a much better option playing in this system

9265~~~
Why are we still talking about this guy?  He hasn't shown a single match where I have thought he was worth even 1/4 of the asking price and weekly wages.  Don't care what the name on the back of his shirt reads.  He looks like a pub player.  Done.  Bye.

9266~~~
Do you think Monaco or Falcao would agree to him coming to OT for a trial?

9267~~~
I'll be honest I've thought for a while that this is a transfer that is already wrapped up and was from the start. It will be a real shame if we have committed to paying £40m+ for him though, because he is looking very unlikely to justify it.

9268~~~
From someone who wants rid of Falcao asap... am I the only one who thought he was ok today? He messed up a pass early on in the game, but other than that I thought his movement was outstanding. Very unlucky not to have a goal, ridiculous angle though. Also, he was fouled leading up to Hazard's goal.

It's nothing incredible but a solid 6/10 for me.

9269~~~
Considering whats been said by his agent lately, I think its safe to say we wont be signing him. Even if there was some option to sign him already wrapped up (which I believe there was) it would always have been an option dependant on some things etc

9270~~~
He wasn't bad, but he wasn't great either, I'd say decent performance considering the circumstances.

As I said last week in Rooney's thread, Falcao is capable of playing at pretty much same level on which was Rooney playing during last few weeks, praise for Rooney's tactical greatness was way over the top, but nothing we didn't hear before.

9271~~~
I thought that we wouldn't be keeping him since about January, so I said I'd rather Wilson gets all of his minutes.

Feel the same after today. It's a waste to give him any more game time.

9272~~~
Im pretty certain that this wouldn't be allowed under accounting rules. If we'd agreed to buy him then I think there would have to be a provision in the accounts accompanied by notes. Otherwise our accounts would be misleading investors and the auditors won't (or shouldn't, rather) sign off accounts that don't provide a true and fair view. I'm going off degree level logic here so maybe someone who knows more in depth accounting would be able to clarify.

Anyway, I thought he was ok actually, not great but not spectacularly awful. Just isn't the world class finisher he was. Had he been we'd have drawn this game at the least.

9273~~~
I thought he looked sharper. Had he not been playing against the league's best defence, I think he'd have scored. I don't want us to keep him, too old, injury prone, playing shite, etc, but he is looking better to me. Wouldn't be surprised if he went to La Liga or Serie A and started banging in 30+ a season.

9274~~~
Why do people think the loan deal was only in Utds favour, don't people think Monaco and Falcao would have wanted assurances too. A player of Falcao's stature wouldn't be going to any club to prove his abilities. If that was the case why wouldnt every club just sign the player on loan first and then see if it works out before buying them? The only thing Falcao I believe needed to prove was his fitness...

9275~~~
I saw him at the start of the season and I loved his movement and the fact that he was always playing on the shoulder of the last defender. He has lost his mojo big time, though. I don't know what LVG wants to do with him, but he's shown this season that he can revitalise players, so if he thinks he can bring him back to his best, I'm happy. Part of me thinks that this is a Shevchenko or Torres kind of situation, and that he might be past his best.

I really hope he's just lacking confidence and needed some time to get used to the pace and physicality of the premiership, because he's one of the greatest strikers in the world when he's on form. Him and ADM being the players we all know they can be would be feckin phenomenal for us next season.

9276~~~
Not sure, might be right. I think the fees agreed, just needed to prove his fitness. Players like Falcao don't go to football clubs on a years trial to prove anything other than that!!

9277~~~
I'm not saying it was a loan for United favour (to see if he can make it back). The loan I reckon was probably to benefit Monaco, what I am saying is there would have been some things have to happen for the deal to go through from a contractual standpoint, given his agents comments this season, I think its safe to say that those things haven't happened and we wont be signing him.

Lucky for us, as I actually reckon we would have probably preferred to sign him permanently last summer, but Monaco wanted to defer for FFP reasons luckily for us

9278~~~
I just don't see it. That aside, both Falcao and the club would then know that he wasn't staying if what your saying is true. Do you then think LVG would then play a player that knew he wasn't staying? Not to mention in the biggest game of the season? In fact given where we are at present, do you think the player would be anywhere near the dressing room? Do you think Falcao looks like a man who's thinks he's not here next season?

9279~~~
The sad thing is I think that was his best performance for us so far. Shows how disappointing he has been overall

9280~~~
Despite a potential foul from Terry for their goal - it really looked like an awful first touch from him - something we've seen too much of this season.

After that, he did come into the game a lot more in the second half - he really didn't stop trying - should have scored the one where he hit the post, but was unlucky not to score the ther chance due to great defending from Cahill. Also a good save Tom Courtois.

The commentators kept saying it, but I noticed it all game - the players just don't trust him. They don't want to thread him through when he makes runs, aim for others when they cross - it really doesn't give a striker too much confidence. He's been awful for most of the season, but today he wasnt awful - just not good.

9281~~~
Such a shame that it did not work.

I was so excited and happy that we got him.

9282~~~
Of course he has to prove his abilities he is recovering from a serious injury from which recovery is not guaranteed, any player is going to have to prove himself after that. Factor in his age, the wages, transfer fee and a loan deal was the only option, either that or stay at Monaco and seeing as they wanted his wages off the books that wasn't going to happen. Monaco and falcao weren't really in a position to bargain just as they won't be this summer, there is no way it is a permanent transfer, falcao and his agent have spoken numerous times about playing elsewhere next season.

The reason other teams didn't take him on loan was because not many could afford his wage and the few that could didn't need him and didn't want to waste huge wages on a backup player.

9283~~~
He does seem to slip over an awful lot, on and off the ball. Maybe he just needs a new pair of boots.

9284~~~
The sad thing for me is I think if he got a run of games up top himself he'd soon be banging in the goals plus his confidence would flood back. Our players would get used to him also as his strength are his runs in behind and in the box power movement and finishing (confidence plays a part in this). We just haven't utilised this enough and getting him to come short just doesn't work for him. He is far to expensive for a gamble given his age and how he's performed but if he'd drop his wages and the right transfer fee was agreed if not be against him starting as our main striker next season. I'd also have a bet on he'd be top scorer in the league. But as it stands right now there is no way we will sign him and that is correct given the outlay.

9285~~~
Agree. 

I think it's a shame for him as a) all strikers work off confidence, and his must be very low right now and b) there isn't a fan that doesn't want it to work out and I think he knows that. That adds pressure which makes each miss worse and takes confidence down again. 

I think he suffers, as all do, when Carrick isn't playing and Rooney drops deep. He needs movement around him, which Rooney would provide, to give him those few seconds a lone striker rarely gets to make his shot. Our system hadn't suited him all season and he has seemed to struggle with the physicality of the prem.

9286~~~
Of course confidence makes a lot of difference, but his first touch has never been reliable and he's never been strong with a defender in his back. That means it's not only questionable wether he's enough quality to play for United, it means also he's not the right kind of striker for this style of football.

9287~~~
Falcao is clearly not suited to the van gaal system. He was always great in a counter attacking 4:4:2 line up. Would have been great in a SAF United.
Pretty sure he'll be returned to Monaco, and we'll enter a bidding war with chelsea for Bale. Bale is our man.
All this crap about Madrid not selling = rubbish. They have to say that in order to maintain his value to recouperate their money. With fickle madrid fans turning against him, and being dropped and substituted, madrid won't get the kind of marketing return on him they would have wanted. Won't be too many madrid fans buying Bale shirts. The whole thing is leading up to a fight between us and chelsea for Bale. Forget Falcao.

9288~~~
How much did we lay Monaco for the loan deal?

9289~~~
I did enjoy how the ball hit him on the back to set-up the Herrera dive... it's just that bit funnier when it's Falcao.

9290~~~
whoever buys him from Monaco his price has surely halved now

9291~~~
Even at half what they were asking for last summer I'm struggling to see why anyone would buy him.

9292~~~
He was probably better than what many on here are saying, but let's not sign him. He is just not up to it anymore. Also, is it just me or does he seem to fall over <i>all </i>the time? Everything he does he seems to end up on the ground?

9293~~~
It's not just you. I remember very early in the season a friend of mine remarked on it and since then I've been on the look out and yeah he falls over an absurd number of times. Often it's down to pressure from defenders and he just doesn't have any strength but there's also been loads of times he has collapsed when trying to shoot/pass/control the football. Never seen anything like it tbh.

9294~~~
It's amazing how a bad injury can destroy a player. Once one of the best strikers in the world - Torres another great example of this.

9295~~~
A good striker could have won that game for us yesterday.That's the harsh truth. Chelsea were there for the taking first half.

9296~~~
There is something wrong in this story. Yesterday Falcao barely got a pass until ADM came on. Then in a matter of minutes he hit the bar, had a shot deflected, and was in the game. He actually began to worry Terry. Yet there were times before AdM came on when the pass was there for all to see but none of our players passed it to him. Either ADM understands him or has that inherent ability to draw out a striker but that change was quite remarkable.

9297~~~
He's muscular as anything too. It's weird.

9298~~~
So, will Wilson or Depay wear the #9 next season?

9299~~~
You make them sound like they are down to their last pound or that he's 35. If Walcott was sold, would Arsenal allow him to go on loan before someone bought him? If your Monaco or Falcao what have you achieved by the loan deal? You've saved 6m but equally got a player potential returning that's now worth less than before it? He'd have been worth more scoring goals at Monaco this season and proving his worth there. It's not like he was coming to a club that he could guarantee regular football.

Also why would Utd let Welbeck go, to replace him with a player that might be only here a season. Clearly the transfer was nothing to do with Wilson. We were in no pressure to to sell Welbeck.

Clearly it's not worked out for either party's and I'm guessing they are making Utd aware that should they decide to back out, they have other options. It's no different than any other transfer but I expect he'll still be here next season for an undisclosed fee.

9300~~~
We barely made a pass to him. Everything went down the wings.

9301~~~
True. But when he did get the ball he showed no sign of doing anything with it (except give it away.) The other players don't trust him I guess.

9302~~~
I think its clear it's not been a successful loan deal but that's the same of most of the signings. Would we be paying Real 60m if ADM was a lone deal? The issue is the same for both players and many previously too. it takes a season to get use to a league that many outside of it underestimate how hard it is.

I know people think money solves everything but if I ask most on here, to move to Spain with their families to a new job, language, culture, I think most would have to admit they wouldn't be at their best in 8 months.

9303~~~
I read that and remembered this:



And likened it to that gif of an old guy who looks like Falcao, falling about the floor, for no reason.
Maybe he needs different football boots?

9304~~~
Di Maria has done already. Not great, but already.
Rojo has done well.
Blind excellent.
Costa brilliant.
Sanchez brilliant. And the list goes on.

Sorry bud, but that excuse doesnt roll.

9305~~~
Behave, are you telling me the ADM has been ok? Lots of assist but at least 3 of those were missplaced shots. Also Mata and Rooney turned crap crosses into good goals. Like I said, would you pay 60m for ADM based on this seasons performances? 
Rojo has been just ok and nothing else. Better than Paddy, I don't think so.
Blind has been good. 
Costa scored goals and Sanchez went off the boil since Christmas.
The list, who's that then? 

Without looking elsewhere, is DDG better than first season, or Mata or Felliani?

9306~~~
Welbeck wanted to leave so there was pressure to sell him and that is the biggest reason why he left. Monaco wanted falcao's wages off their books and the only way to do that was to sell him for a huge loss or loan him out. I am sure they assumed he would score goals and then be sold for a high fee either to is or another club, if they has kept him and he struggled in France instead of showing his worth then he would be even harder to offload. It was a gamble either way so I think it makes perfect sense why they loaned him out. It was a gamble for all three parties and hasn't worked out well for anyone unfortunately.

Even without a cruciate injury Monaco would have been struggling to sell him for close to what they paid, pretty much any player close to 29 is not going to be easy to sell for £40m let alone one who is injured. There should be zero chance he comes back no matter what the fee is it makes no sense for us or the player, why would he even want to come back and sit on the bench every week unless all he is interested in is money.

9307~~~
He's utterly useless, he's genuinely barely PL quality anymore. Its sad to watch now.

9308~~~
I could  be wrong but I think it was 6M for this season. It time to cut our loses with this now.

9309~~~
I think he'll be here next season, as <a class="username" data-user="83071, @Wilson Litchmore" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/83071/">@Wilson Litchmore</a> says, for an undisclosed fee.

9310~~~
Monaco's owner Dmitry Rybolovlev removed a lot of their funding last year after he was denied citizenship and had to pay 2.7 billion in his divorce. Monaco changed their plans from signing superstars and paying them huge wages to signing young developing players who they could develop and make a profit on and supplementing their squad with loan signings so allowing Falcao to join us on loan and getting a good loan fee along with removing around 1 million pounds a month in wages was a pretty good deal for them as if it worked out here we would have paid the agreed price and even if it didnt they can still sell him this year for a decent price based on his past. There was no telling how he would come back after his knee injury but the fact that things haven't worked out for him at United wont put teams off or affect his price tag the same way it would have if he had played for Monaco all season and put in similar performances. What you're saying could very well be right of course but its not as if Monaco had nothing to gain by allowing him to join us on loan.

9311~~~
'kin Ada, that's some settlement. Who's the lucky ex?

9312~~~
Unless its Monaco paying us, then we're being ripped off.

9313~~~
Given his performances this season, Monaco would be insane to think they can get a 40 million pound fee. A quarter of that maybe but if Van Gaal wants to hang on to him, we'd be bargaining from a position of strength (for once). Despite his agent's huffing and puffing, I haven't read of any firm interest from other clubs. We'll just have to wait and see.

9314~~~
All he has done this season is stopping Wilson's progress. Not a single minute on the pitch has he done something that Wilson can't apart from falling over three times a game. Never been more frustrated watching someone play for us have I have watching him. A complete waste of resources. Chico staying would've been the better option. Worth a punt but in the end it has been nothing short of abysmal.

9315~~~
Is this experiment officially over...

please.

9316~~~
I am genuinely worried after yesterday that we've already agreed to sign Falcao or are seriously considering it.  That turn towards goal he made in the second half is being talked up but he did nothing else otherwise and his weakness in getting challenged by Terry cost us the game.  I wanted him off after the first 45 and I can't understand how he stayed on while RVP, who scored the equalizer against Chelsea at home, was kept on the bench.  Why put RVP on the bench if you're not going to play him?

These comparisons to Rooney's play last week - can you please just stop it?  Rooney was double and triple-teamed through the entire match and it's part of why we won.  Are we that desperate?

9317~~~
He got fouled by Terry. Other players would have went down there too and 9/10 times it would have been given as a foul. Yes, Rooney was equally as average against City. Falcao got the ball 32 times yesterday, Rooney got it 35 times against City. Neither of them really done much with it. Falcao could have scored yesterday, Rooney got an assist (offside mind you) but offered no goal threat. City also played a lot more open and Chelsea sat back the whole game.

9318~~~
I don't believe we will sign him UNLESS Ballague was right when he said we have already signed him but they said it was a loan because of FFP.
It just wouldn't make sense otherwise, unless Van Gaal and the club genuinely have seen some kind of improvement behind the scenes and they think a full season post injury will of done him a world of good.
I just can't see it though.

9319~~~
No way we are signing him. I just can't see it at all. Doesn't mean people should have their minds made up on his performances before he walks on the pitch though.

9320~~~
Quoting my own post because I just read this article.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/things-happened-falcaos-last-shot-5549417?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/things-happened-falcaos-last-shot-5549417?</a>

It's not just that he hasn't scored since January, he hasn't even managed to get a shot on target since then. He is staggeringly ineffective.

9321~~~
Would you take him next season on another loan deal?

9322~~~
Not a chance.

9323~~~
No but there always is the SLIGHTEST of chance that a full season post injury under his belt, could help him regain form for a fresh start next season. I just don't see it though.

One of the problems Falcao has had is that he needs a run of games, a real run of games but we can't give him that because he's been so bad.

9324~~~
I would take him on another loan. I think he will be World class next season, wherever he is.

9325~~~
All said and done, LVG is the type of manager that plans constantly for the future.  He's also not a manager for sentiment. There is nobody left at the club that you'd consider shouldn't be here within reason give or take Johnny Evans. Does anyone think LVG would play him if he doesn't think he'd be here next season? Why would he? He could have kept Tom and Danny for a year for cover if it was just a numbers game for the squad. Despite what Danny wanted, could still have kept him and let's be honest, his sale had nothing to do with Wilsons development cause I thought he'd play much more than he has.

Does anyone think if he didn't think he was good enough, would have played him yesterday against the best team in the country? Strange way of saying I don't rate you, but your starting against Chelsea? 

LVG has already said it takes players at least a season to settle......

9326~~~
We scored four goals against City. Never looked like scoring against Chelsea. Going out on a limb here but I suspect the identity of our most advanced player may be relevant in trying to understand the discrepancy in outcomes.

Something else you might want to think about is how the hell Falcao managed to touch the ball less than Rooney in a game where we completed almost 200 more passes than we did against City?

9327~~~
I don't see any world class potential about him in April 2015, irrespective of what he did before his injury. Based on what we have seen at United, he lacks pace and strength, nor does he have the ability to create something on his own. So you are left with his finishing, which has been average at best. Even assuming his finishing would improve with more regular game time, I think United would need a more rounded, versatile frontman to compete against the very best. That's without mentioning that he's 29 and would be on the slide soon in any event.

9328~~~
Nobody looked for him until later in the game. I'm not even saying he played well because he didn't, but most of our play was in defence and down the wings which amounted to nothing. City came at us and played an open game. They paid the price for it. Just hope we have our other players fit for next week. Goodison has been tough recently.

9329~~~
How many games have Chelsea lost at home compared to City or anyone else for that matter? Yep we've done brill against Chelsea previously when Falcao wasn't here, haven't we?

9330~~~
It has and Everton seem to have turned the corner. Hard to know which one of our injured players we missed most but I definitely hope we're not forced to play Falcao up top again. He's playing like a shell of the player he once was. If Rooney is needed in midfield again (where he did a reasonable job) then I'd drop Falcao for Van Persie.

9331~~~
Not sure what your point is. Did you think Falcao played well? I thought he was shit.

9332~~~
I think most people would say in order to find your form, you need a run of games. I think SAF said Rooney needed to play regularly. The only player I know in the history of watching the prem, that can not play 3-4 games but come in and play like he's played every week is Ole.....

9333~~~
So given LVG picked him, his assessment of players must be shit too then....

9334~~~
When Falcao doesn't play - 'If we provided that type of service to Falcao he'd be amazing'
When Falcao plays - 'It wasn't his fault, the service was crap'

Rather then blaming the service, could the problem not just be, you know, Falcao? How are you supposed to provide service to a striker who can't hold up the ball without falling over/being muscled off it, and who you can't play the ball in behind too as he simply doesn't have the pace to get onto it? 

Someone mentioned earlier that the midfielders looked reluctant to play it into Falcao a lot of the time (hence the 'lack of service') but can you blame them? Unless the pass is 100% perfect, he doesn't have a chance. Thats why Rooney (even a Rooney playing badly) is better, because he still has the physicality and enough pace to keep defenders occupied and not have to rely on perfect service.

9335~~~
nah..we're not signing him...I mean how much would he cost? We could get better without a past injury for that. I like him as a person, I think he is genunine...but he will never hack it in the Premier League, it's too fast for him. Also...it's not as though he had four seasons as a considered great player...what was it one? - perhaps at a stretch two?

9336~~~
Well LVG isn't some nostradamus genius. Just because he picked a player doesn't mean the player will automatically play well.

9337~~~
Well he's not going to get a run of games if he plays as poorly as he did yesterday. That's the Catch 22 that every player at a top team has to deal with. Some cope, many don't. 

I do feel a bit sorry for him because he's got the added pressure of trying to convince the manager to make his loan deal permanent. But he's being touted to us as an elite player, who will cost elite wages and an elite fee. The harsh reality is that we've seen nothing on the pitch that's come close to justifying that kind of outlay. CL qualification is hugely important for us and there's no way we can risk allowing someone who's been so poor try and play his way into form. He'll have to do that at a different club.

9338~~~
You are ignoring the fact that he only started because Rooney had to play in midfield and RVP isn't fit, if blind, carrick or RVP were available falcao would have been sat on the bench.

9339~~~
He didn't exactly have many options. I'd say he's quite good at assessing players, though. Which is why he'll drop Falcao for the Everton game. Wait and see.

9340~~~
Never made any reference to how he played. I thought he did ok. So do we trust LVG assessment or not, or maybe we only agree with it when it agrees with ours? If he picked me to play upfront against the best team in Prem, I'd think he rates me. It's funny cause despite what others thought last year, Young and Felliani ft his season feel the same.

9341~~~
I personally didn't have any issues with Falcao starting as we didn't have much option once Rooney was going to play in midfield. It doesn't mean we shouldn't call a spade a spade and say Falcao was largely ineffective and has been whenever he has been on the pitch this season.

9342~~~
Rademal "ran about" Falcao. £40 million is a snip for the shift he puts in.<span style="color: #ffffff">..</span>

9343~~~
Big call though playing him against Chelsea if he didn't? I think if Carrick is fit, he'll be dropped but that's also because Rooney is the best forward at the club.

9344~~~
I'm not saying he's not been. I'm just saying like ADM, it's takes a season to find your feet in this league. Honestly, based on this seasons performances, who pay 60m for ADM? ADM has played more games too....

9345~~~
ADM looks like a quality player, just badly out of form. 

Falcao looks like a complete busted flush.

9346~~~
Had we kept Frazier Campbell, we'd be no worse off. Falcao's been less than mediocre all season, I can't believe people are still debating that fact. It's been a pricey gamble that has not paid off. There's no chance we are keeping him.

9347~~~
Has lost a yard of pace or something? Must admit I only saw the pre injury Falcao play a few times...

9348~~~
ADM.....60m worth?

9349~~~
He wasn't shit he was ok, no more no less.
And playing Man City at home can not be compared to playing Chelsea away, totally different.
Had Rooney scored with his chance the game would have changed, as long as it was 0-0 Chelsea s game plan remained.
We didn't create much at all, not sure that was down to Falcao.

9350~~~
He's the worst striker we've had at this club in recent years, Owen, Chicha, Berba, Welbz, Roo, Rvp, have all been better, even Wilson has scored an equal amount of goals. He might be a good player but it hasnt worked out for him here, would be a disgrace if we'd sign him and every time he plays for us is ridiculous, as he offers nothing. Oke he may have been better than Diouf.

9351~~~
Nobody's saying he's been worth that money, but he's produced far more than Falcao, despite struggling with the transition to the Premier League. Had we aquired his services on the same terms as Falcao, there would be similar questions being asked, but I think more would be willing to take a chance on him staying around. Falcao's done next to nothing for us.

9352~~~
Is there a chance we could sign him for around 10-12 million? I'd buy him for that price and a reduced wage.

9353~~~
Unless we get a bargain new deal then he's got to be sent packing.  Some world class strikers can't cut it in the premier league, see Shevchenko, and some world class strikers are never the same after bad injuries, see Torres.  The signs are that Falcao fits into one or both of these.  You've got to have massive balls, and a massive wallet to take the gamble on him coming good next year at the currently agreed terms of the deal.

9354~~~
Diouf was a beast! Better than Manucho though.

9355~~~
Regardless of any price cut, it's only be a 'bargain' if he actually started to look like a footballer again. He makes the free transfer of Michael Owen - another star striker ravaged by injury and signed at almost exactly the same age - look like one of Fergie's masterstrokes.

9356~~~
Di Maria has at least had a few games where he's looked like a world class player. And that's from someone who thinks he's been a crushing disappointment and will probably go down as a terrible waste of money. Bad and all as he's been, you can see why we signed him.

Falcao hasn't even given a glimmer of hope. He's just looked so... ordinary. If you'd never seen him play football before this season you'd wonder how the hell he ended up at Manchester United.

9357~~~
How do we explain why he is still getting minutes?

9358~~~
So your sayin' if it was a loan deal, we'd be saying he shouldn't stay but because we've bought him, we don't have a lot of choice....?

9359~~~
Injuries and RVP still lacking full match rhythm, as LVG would say.

9360~~~
The worst part is how fecking predictable he is. Every time you think maybe this is the match he has a blinder, but it's the same old crap. I think he's scored one goal for us vs Villa, where it wasn't a scrappy tap-in. Honestly, you wouldn't tell the difference between him and Rickie Lambert.

9361~~~
I think that Wilson has also been out injured during RVP's time on the side lines.

I don't think we'll see very much more of him now that Van Persie is fit.

9362~~~
I'd agree to some degree. He's looked completely off the pace but in fairness over the years we've seen this before and be proven right as many times as proven wrong. If we listened to the media, DDG, Felliani, Mata and Young shouldn't have been here. Go back further Ronaldo was a one trick pony!!!

9363~~~
I hope you are right but I am worried we have already signed him.

9364~~~
I'm saying exactly what I just wrote.

9365~~~
Actually it was 4, at least. That's if we're talking only since he's played in Europe, and discounting his Monaco spell which in spite of injuries still saw him score 13 in 22 games. His tally for Porto and Atletico from 2009-2013 went 34, 38, 36 and 34 respectively. 

In my opinion injuries have caught up with him, and the nature of the PL hasn't helped.

9366~~~
No, but still worth signing.

Falcao, I genuinely wouldn't want on a free.

9367~~~
Does anyone know Falcao's living arrangement? If he bought a house as opposed to leasing or renting, we might have a hint to his future here.

9368~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px"><b>Radamel Falcao agent in talks with Liverpool as Manchester United pass on permanent deal</b></span>
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/571498/Man-Utd-Liverpool-Radamel-Falcao-Agent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/571498/Man-Utd-Liverpool-Radamel-Falcao-Agent</a>

I'd prefer if he went to Chelsea as that would put an end to their title hopes next year, but Liverpool would be good.
Whichever team he goes to, will be "reduced".

9369~~~
I'd really rather he didn't go to Liverpool (don't see how he can anyway, it would shatter their wage structure) just in case of the very remote possibility that he suddenly regains his old form and starts scoring 30+ a season for fun. Let him go abroad.

9370~~~
True. Although I think Falcao is not the forward they should go for - so in that case it would be good cause he'll probably be another Balotelli, there is a slight chance he could be back to his old form in which case it would be a disastrous story. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

9371~~~
The fear with this guy is that he leaves for one of our rivals and suddenly remembers how to play football. As things stand though, in his current form he wouldnt even be a top striker for a mid table club.

He seems like a confidence player. I dont think his early appearances for us were all that bad, but he seems to be getting progressively worse.

I suppose it could be perception though - since he is the current caf scapegoat all eyes seem to be on him and how shit he is.

9372~~~
I actually thought he played well against Chelsea.

9373~~~
It won't happen - it's quite apparent his body can't do what he wants it to do anymore.

9374~~~
It's a bit harsh picking him out from Saturday, but nobody would be doing so, had he not been a disaster from start to finish. I understand the comparisons between his performance at Chelsea and the over analysis of a poor Rooney performance against City but to be fair, Rooney is one of the all time leading goal scorers for the club, and as captain, whether you're English or not, that's always going to buy you a bit more leeway. 

Falcao at United hasn't worked, and we won't waste any more money than we need to on him. It clearly wasn't for the lack of trying though, and I'll wish him all the best for the future because I can't see him staying in England.

9375~~~
I did too. 6/10 for me.

9376~~~
Uf I've been harsh on him, my rating is 5.1 as opposed to average of 5.6. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

9377~~~
6/10 surely means average. not played well?

9378~~~
Blows my mind that anyone can think he played well against Chelsea. A lot was made of the fact that when we played City Rooney touched the ball less than he ever has in any game for us before. Neville bigged up his off the ball work but I don't think anyone here would have called it a particularly good performance. Average at best. A lot of people were very critical. In a game where he did, at least, get an assist.

Against Chelsea, Falcao touched the ball even less than Rooney did against City. In a game where, as a team, we made almost 200 more passes over 90 minutes. It almost takes a conscious effort to be so peripheral. How on earth does that translate to playing well?

9379~~~
6/10 for a striker who plays for a side that loses 1-0 is quite good. My team average this season is 5.7, my highest rated player is 6.6. So 6/10 from me is a solid rating.

9380~~~
He had a few passes, some with his back on the goal and that was about it. Again was brought to the ground too easily a few times.

9381~~~
How many times was he played in? very few that I can recall. Two come to my mind, one he managed to hit the post. He was playing against the best defensive unit in the league, 6 defenders essentially, and on another day would have scored. He was good, nothing special, but good.

He was fouled tbf.

9382~~~
It depends if people are quantifying it with "compared to past performances..." because, compared to past performances from him, he did well... compared to a normal strikers performance, he was - like you say - average at best.

Whilst he was more-or-less fine on the ball bar one or two crap moments, he just hides behind opposition players too much, and doesn't show for the ball nearly enough as he should.

9383~~~
On another day he also might have played well. Neither happened on Saturday.

9384~~~
I disagree.

9385~~~
That's not a good thing - he should have hit the target (hell, he should have bloody scored!)

Also, the reason he didn't get played in a lot is because his runs are garbage most of the time... also, he very rarely shows himself for the ball for any quick one-two's in behind or anything of the sort to even be attempted.

9386~~~
On his weaker foot, and the angle was ridiculous. Few strikers in the world are scoring that.

9387~~~
I actually thought he was ok, Could of been better but definitely shouldn't be made out as the scapegoat either. Put it this way, I don't think Van Persie would of done any better if he started.

9388~~~
Ridiculous is a bit far - considering Courtois fell on his arse, he had a shed load of the goal to aim.

9389~~~
It would've been a miracle of he scored. The angle was ridiculous. He's lucky to have hit the upper V bar as it is.

9390~~~
Disagree, Courtois had the other side covered perfectly, he moves to his left. One place Falcao can put that, the exact corner he aims for, top left.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0MVly3Axuk?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

9391~~~
No chance - Courtois doesn't make himself big at all - he hits that high and anywhere on target and its in.

9392~~~
He had the goal completely covered, it would've been extremely low percentage if it went in. If it were anyone other than Courtois there may have been a slightly better chance.

9393~~~
Van Persie would have buried that chance past Coutrios before he could even blink.

9394~~~
The same RVP that has been missing quite a few sitters this season... (infact didn't he miss a few chances vs Chelsea @ OT)

9395~~~
Not this season I don't think, He appeared to snatch at chances more then ever this year. The RVP of 18 months ago would of scored without a doubt though.

9396~~~
Amazing how the off the bar shot is being used as ammunition against Falcao. Get over it.

9397~~~
Debatable, but Van Persie is left footed.

9398~~~
Agreed. I actually thought it was a great move from Falcao. Moved his body and looked across the goal. Totally tricked Courtois. Shame he couldnt finish it off.

9399~~~
Oh come on. Mata and Hazard both showed how to convert a chance like that within the last week and they're not even strikers.

9400~~~
Actually, looking at the gif he was at a worse angle than Mata/Hazard. Still, if you don't hit the target you don't score. Courtois had over-committed to cover the pass across the box for a tap-in at the far post. If Falcao didn't choose that option then he has to, at least, hit the target. That miss summed up his season IMO. A wild, off-balance swipe.

9401~~~
Unlike Di Maria i just don't see him improving next season. Hope the rumours about the club telling Monaco that they will not be making a bid are true.

9402~~~
Shame about his song. It's catchy as hell.

9403~~~
He'd be so bad at Liverpool. They like to try and kill teams on the counter, and he just doesn't have the pace to play with them.

9404~~~
I don't think anyone here has used it as ammunition against Falcao - but at the same time, it was probably our best chance in a game of few, thus, I hardly think it warrant's praise that he didn't hit the target.

9405~~~
That will be his legacy.

9406~~~
Nobody is praising him for not hitting the target, just pointing out that it was a hard angle to score from. He had no idea Courtois was going to cover the far post as he did, and with his size and reach, the only way around him was a ridiculous attempt at sneaking it into the top corner, which he almost managed.

9407~~~
There must be another player out there with the same syllable structure we can buy, who we can transfer the song to.

9408~~~
lo lo lololo lo lo lololo Anders Lindergaad

9409~~~
Pouge that's chance was completely different in all fairness.

9410~~~
Lo lo lololo lo lo Alberto Morenoooooo

9411~~~
In ligue 1 there is Brandao and Romao but you don't want them, otherwise it could work with Ronaldo.

9412~~~
He made a meal out of it all the same. A confident striker at least hits the target or makes the goalkeeper work.

9413~~~
we need to retire the song in his honour

9414~~~
You can just about fudge Angel Di Maria's name into the song, but is he any more deserving of it?

Just do the Lololo bits as normal, and then just everybody yell "PHIL JONES!"

9415~~~
lo lo lo lo, anybody but falcao, anybodyyy but fal-cao

9416~~~
I hope so!

9417~~~
Unfortunately for us, we don't have a single one.

It's odd that no one refers to the fact that that was the only chance he had all game, and it came from a player who's not good enough to start.

The talking point shouldn't be Falcaos touches, or his one missed chance, we should be asking why we created so few chances in a game where we had 400 more passes than Chelsea, in addition to 70% possession.

9418~~~
The thing is abuot Falcao, he doesn't feel you with any confidence that he is not going to feck chances if he gets them. I know it's sort of unfair to think like that but when I look at him, I don't see a player strong enough nor good enough to control the ball in a situation with pressure and "look" dangerous by at the very least working the keeper. Football is a psychological game and when defenders see him, they must feel already so confident that they're gonna contain him without much pb.

9419~~~
Do you mean aside from the one that was blocked by Cahill and the left foot effort from just outside he area?

Not to mention the 7 other shots that were actually on target.

It's clear why though, they sat back and parked the bus while we had our main creative midfielder in DM, no Carrick playmaking and our best striker in midfield.


But yeah questions to be asked... <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

9420~~~
So, you believe that a player can go from being a 4 goal/season striker to 30 goal/season striker?
Has this ever happened to a player of his age (or older)?
By my reckoning he is getting worse, not better.

It could be that the EPL just doesnt suit him and that if he goes back to Spain he could score 20+ goals/season, but in the EPL, this guy is a bit of a joke. The way he falls around like he is a new born calf is actually quite funny.
Torres prevented Chelsea from winning the title and I'm sure Falcao could do a similar job for another team in the EPL. My preferred destination for Falcao is Chelsea, Arsenal, Man City or LFC.

What does amaze me is that LVG keeps giving his non-scoring striker, game time. He isnt going to score for us, so why play him? Maybe I am missing something.

9421~~~
What a strange post????

9422~~~
There were 7 shots on goal, yes, 2 of which were on target. 4 of these shots were from well outside the box, of which 2 were from McNair, our centre back. That's quite simply not good enough. The simple fact that McNair had the most shots target should be embarrassing, especially, given that it was from 30-35 yards out. The other shot on target was that lifeless chip from Rooney, we really did test Courtois.

9423~~~
Hard man to please!

9424~~~
There were 15 shots on goal, 7 of which were on target.

9425~~~
Or even why WC Rooney couldn't hit the target with his two sitters, laid on a plate for him.

9426~~~
Shhhh don't want to detract away from how shit Falcao is.
Really, he was a little unlucky not to score, if he had been playing with confidence under his belt, he probably would have scored.

9427~~~
Be interesting if on MNF Gary does a deep analysis of how Falcao actually played like Rooney against City. Only difference, there was no ACM (Herrera) or Carrick to make that incisive pass.

9428~~~
The pass came from Luke Shaw, who started. 

Re the last paragraph, two reasons. Chelsea defended very well and Falcao himself. A stronger, quicker and harder working striker would have asked Chelsea's central defensive pairing a lot more questions.

9429~~~
Hererra, Rooney and Mata can all pick a pass. Can't blame absent players for Falcao's lack of opportunities.

9430~~~
Yeah, you're correct, it was Shaw.

As with the last part, I don't agree, completely. Yes, Chelsea were organised, however, Young, unlike Shaw, failed to create a single chance having seen quite a bit of the ball. The, going to the right side, Mata and Valencia offered very little and Rooney did nothing to help, as he was more interested in his long diagonals across the pitch. 

You could see a massive change in tempo and intent in the last 10 or so minutes were we realised that we had to push harder to get an equaliser, but it was a little bit too late. I think we were far too complacent and maybe even over confident in our ability and philosophy, added to the fact that our midfield probably didn't offer enough creativity.

9431~~~
I don't think he had a lack of opportunites, I think he would have had more if Herrera was playing his normal role and Carrick had been in Rooney's position. I think Falcao had 3 reasonable chances, 1 hit the post (when he probably should have scored), he had a long range effort where his movement opened up a gap, and Cahill blocked one of his shots from a good pass back on the right side.

9432~~~
I don't think we were complacent but I do think we lacked a bit of creativity. I also think you're not giving enough credit to Chelsea. They were at home, on a smallish pitch and are masters at sucking the life out of a game of football. With a full squad to choose from Mourinho was always in a good position to shut us out and that's what they did. We were still the width of a post away from getting a draw, though, which would have been a very acceptable result.

9433~~~
Dont forget the other chance when Fellaini squared it to him in the box. For me that was the best chance of the game along with Rooney's - a bit more composure and he would have scored.

Context is important if comparing with Rooney last week - as Pogue said, Rooney did manage an assist, and frankly you dont put 4 goals past City if your striker isnt contributing anything.
Comparatively, against Chelsea we didnt score and had limited chances, despite ending up with 70% possession, outpassing and outplaying them. To me, that says there is an issue with the striker(s). Of course Chelsea are well organised defensively, but thats why we are meant to have world class attackers capable of breaking it down and producing something.

9434~~~
I think the difference between this week and last was more in the role Rooney played (vs. Carrick) and the role Herrera played (more defensive). Rooney did not have a bad game, but he is not Carrick. And from what I saw, Rooney had the two best chances in the game, and fluffed both (and he is our best striker).

9435~~~
this isn't a debate. there is probably less than 1% chance that he'll be here next season.

9436~~~
That's the problem right there Pexbo! But Rooney missed 3 chances also where he should have atleast worked the keeper!

9437~~~
Of all the weaknesses he's shown this season, slow, weak, poor finishing, the most bizarre one is his total lack of balance.

He seems to just be constantly falling over or about to fall over. Even when he's stood still he looks like he could go at any moment. It's weird.

I thought he was crap against Chelsea as he has been all season really. It's surprising he's managed to score as many as 4 the way he's been.

9438~~~
I dont think we should make a decision based on 1 game. Even the best strikers in the World can have a stinker.
Rooney had an average game against Chelsea. As did Falcao.
The difference is that Rooney has had many great games for us this year. Falcao hasnt.

9439~~~
He doesn't deserve to be the scapegoat for Saturday but he definitely doesn't deserve any praise either, it was a bit of a nothing performance from him really. He couldn't get involved in the game, he didn't beat anyone, win any duels or put the centre halves under any pressure etc etc, when he was involved he didn't produce any real quality and all his attempts were off target. 

He didn't offer the team anything and if you look round the league and elsewhere in Europe there are plenty of players who can offer a lot more, he is being paid the going rate for a world class player and judging him by those standards he has been pathetic in virtually every game he has played and hasn't even produced 45 minutes at that level all season.

9440~~~
Would this bother many if it was true.

9441~~~
Not really. But this might.

9442~~~
I'd take him at £25m and £120k a week, he'll get better next season.

9443~~~
On reduced wages i'd take him over Ings but that's about that.

9444~~~
"According to the Express" - enough said. 

Would be typical if he went there and scored 25 goals though.

9445~~~
Ings has looked miles the better player this season. He can run and control a football for a start.

And Ings isn't good enough for United.

9446~~~
Yea, i want neither at United but if it was between the two i would take Falcao over Ings. My muppet striker signing however remains Dybala.

9447~~~
The falling over part is really unfortunate though. Not trying to make any excuses for him here, but there might be a possible explanation for the phenomenon of someone who actually looks quite built and was not so prone to falling over in his previous clubs, which imo is a combination of a confidence issue (self perpetuated negativity leading to reduced resistance), perception changes (referee tends to believe that someone who falls over is weak and hence less likely to call a foul even if it should be called) and defenders simply being more willing to shove him due to this expected leniency from the referees, as well as knowing that others have tried and often succeeded in the past. A problem that just will not go away so easily imo.

9448~~~
Lets not be so harsh on Falcao. We expect miracles sometimes. He's struggled with the rhythm of the premiership but so has Di Maria. A lot of great players have. He's had his injury problems so the target is bigger on his back. With a pre season things might fall for him. He's been unlucky at times. We obviously have a few decisions to make but I don't think we should be against it at a reduced price. Let's not beat around the bush. It took us a good while to find the confidence to attack teams because perhaps we were worried about the back. If you think back, he's not had THAT many efforts on goal because at times we've created zip and at times it's not run for him. If we play with a quick tempo and good wing play, he'll be alright. This season is a write off. He had no pre season with us and he's missed too much football to be match fit. How can people expect so much of him against Chelsea, when he's barely featured over the last few months? If we can get the price down to 20 million give or take, it could still be a decent option as a back up to rooney

I don't really care what he looks like. If he looks fecked or not. We've seen that with Rooney in the past as well. With it being a loan and going the way it has, it adds a lot of psychological baggage. Without that worry, you see a better player

9449~~~
Only because we haven't yet told Monaco we don't want him. But that conversation will definitely happen.

And if they don't drop their transfer free demand, he'll be back in Monaco. No one is paying £43m for him after this season.

9450~~~
Amen brother

9451~~~
I wouldn't blame the Premiership. I think he's struggled with LvG's rhythm. He's not cut out for this team and the manager has to take the blame for that. RvP might also be past it, but at least he has the skill set to contribute. Falcao offers nothing to the system.

9452~~~
End of the day I believe there is insufficient data on him to make a judgement of the trajectory of his improvement or decline if he were to be permanently signed, with him making mostly 10 minute cameos and sparse starts, all within the context of injury recovery. The issue becomes one of whether the club is willing to pay whatever is demanded at the point of decision in order to obtain such information, and the opportunity cost of such a decision. In terms of a supporter's POV, from my limited knowledge of the club finances and project making decisions, all I can say is that I honestly would not be surprised if the deal goes either way.

9453~~~
25million? seriously? from what we've seen, (no strength, no movement, lack of sharpness, lack of balance etc) we shouldnt pay 2.5mill.
let alone the wages he'd demand.

9454~~~
Even if he is going to improve next season it would still be a stupid signing, Rooney is approaching 30, RVP is nearly 32 so adding another player who will be 30 in less than a year makes no sense. If he was guaranteed to be world class and score 25 goals it might be worth the risk but that would require a remarkable turnaround.

9455~~~
You never know, this season may just be about getting him match ready. Sure it's been frustrating for everyone but the guy ain't finished just yet, I don't think so anyway.

9456~~~
He's worth a punt I feel. His wages would need to be severely reduced granted

9457~~~
You don't take £25m punts.

And even if we did I wouldn't take one on Falcao.

9458~~~
25million is a punt??
I love your optimism bud, but the Falcao we all saw demolish Chelsea a couple years back is gone and not coming back.
Next season he'll be fast heading towards 30, as <a class="username" data-user="87150, @Roboc7" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/87150/">@Roboc7</a> made a good point, our other strikers Rooney 30, RvP 33, wouldnt be a smart bit of business for so many reasons...

9459~~~
Agree that player is definitely gone, he might well have more to offer than this season but even so after three serious knee injuries and close to turning 30 I doubt he has many good seasons left no matter what.

9460~~~
Everyone's been so quick to write him off but I wouldn't put it past LVG to show a little faith if Ed can greatly reduce the price. If he wants to stay and fight good luck to him. Those words from Monaco show how ultimately the press know nothing, they were saying we'd already decided we weren't going to sign him in Jan/Feb time.

9461~~~
I think most people in this thread expect him to have a good season next year. Unless we sign him.

9462~~~
Don't be silly, which dog would people have to kick? They at least thought they'd have Felliani and Young for this season?

9463~~~
You get the feeling it could come back and bite us by not signing him

But who in their right mind would buy a player based on his performances this season. His wages are crazy high and the fee itself even if they managed to get it down....just no boardroom would possibly green light a deal. Even a fee of 10 mill would seem too high

9464~~~
Well, its either RVP or Falcao. One will go and one will stay. Though either one of them has to realise their not our number one striker.

9465~~~
I don't. And he won't. Not anywhere competitive, that is.

9466~~~
It's a pretty easy choice considering it would cost a lot more to get Falcao than we would get for selling Van Persie. Add to that the fact Van Persie can cope with the EPL to some extent while Falcao can't.


I think it's a certainty that we will buy a striker and a good one at that. Strikers win league titles.

9467~~~
No brainer really, though if say RVP wants out then I can see the club buying Falcao at cut price/wages.

9468~~~
One of them has, at the very least, won us a game pretty much by himself this season... the other has not come anywhere close to such a feat.

9469~~~
I'm astonished at the slack that gets cut for Falcao here. No way should we be signing him, even if the fee is reduced or anything. He can't even keep his balance this season! 
No thank you.

9470~~~
They have both won us at least 1 game each this season though.

9471~~~
No kidding, its bonkers. He's the new Kagawa on here.

To have him on a free with half the wages... Maybe Id consider it. Probably not. He's not at all what we need and offers nothing different to RVP who himself is going to find being marginalised.

9472~~~
Tell me exactly why we'd keep Falcao and let Little Pea go? particuarly when Chich is younger, offers better movement, faster, stronger, sharper infront of goal.. PL tried and tested and he'd cost us nothing to retain his services, and 1/3rd the amount of weekly wages of Falcao?
I dont know what this bizarre love affair is with some United fans and Falcao, but it needs to stop, sharpish, we cant afford to waste the kind of money if would cost us in terms of transfer fee/wages/agent fees.

9473~~~
After watching the CL 1/4 finals this week I am even more convinced that the problem is not Falcao or RVP. To compete with the elite teams in Europe we need creative central midfielders who are good dribblers and have excellent ball control and short pass abilities. This would allow neat exchanges with top class strikers with similar abilities.
Our current midfielders do not take on opponents and settle far too readily for back and side pass along with wing balls. The only No9s that could flourish with this type of play are the old-fashioned tall English centre forwards. Artisans like Falcao and RVP are completely left out of the game in our present system of play.
I still feel that LVG is working towards getting Utd to play in a way similar to Europe's top teams. To do this our central attacking mid-field has to be replaced. The present midfielders will probably get us into the top 4 this season but for us to progress changes must be made.

9474~~~
Your trying to rationalise these players no longer cutting it. Its nobodys fault, not even their own.

9475~~~
Reputation pure and simple, people expected big things, and when he hasn't reached those marks people can't believe why, so they still think it's achievable. 

Unfortunately that Falcao I believe is never coming back. He has had way long enough to get "match fit" and start producing. The simple fact is he just isn't the player we need, and at the price requested is an insane option to choose.

9476~~~
Maybe they can no longer cut it, however, they have not being given the opportunity, with our style of play to determine whether that is true or not.
When I watch other top teams' central midfielders I am envious, they seem so skillful and creative compared to ours.

9477~~~
I dont subscribe to the midfielders fault for their poor showing, if you can recall RvP's performance level vs Southamption away this season, it gives you an indication of what a forward on top of his game can do, in terms of build up play he was 10/10 that night, shielding the ball, laying it off, creating space with movement... even without his two goals that night and surrounded by underperforming dross RvP's overal game was fantastic, sadly neither he nor Falcao have put in many of those type of displays this year.

Sir Alex last season, we had Carrick & Cleverley in midfield for the majority, and he (RvP) managed near 40 goals to boot, let alone his overal game outside of his goal scoring was on a different level back then,

Yes, I think you do have a point, we could improve our play through the middle, but a forward like Benteke, game to game, would currently offer more right now (leading the line in a 433) than either our superstar, higly paid paring of Falcao or RvP.

9478~~~
Interesting you mention Benteke....I thought about him as a bench back up to Rooney earlier this week as he has similar attributes when it come to leading the line.

9479~~~
Ya, I think there's a fair few who're having similar thoughts, when you look lately at the qualities he offers leading the line... certainly in a 433 he could be very useful as a stand in for Rooney.

9480~~~
I think the love in novelty would quickly wear off if he does return next season and doesn't improve massively, it's only his reputation and fact he is on loan that saves him from being labelled as a huge and expensive flop because that's what he has been so far, it's cost millions since he even had a shot on target let alone scored.

9481~~~
Rather than RVP vs Falcao, it is this - Hernandez vs Falcao - which should be the real comparison.

I would be interested in seeing a poll for choosing between the two, personally would take Hernandez every day of the week.

9482~~~
Now yes, but I wouldn't have then

9483~~~
I'd far rather play Fellaini as a #9 than see Falcao start for us again.

9484~~~
This. Hernandez above Falcao on my team any day.

I don't want to hear from Falcao any longer. Just let him rot in the French League or in Italy if Monaco can sort their own shit themselves.

9485~~~
Well our central midfield is not going to change their way of playing with so few games left so we need to stick with what has been effective for us. That is Rooney up front with Falcao on the bench.

9486~~~
All things considered, it's been a strange season for Falcao. For the first month or so he played pretty well - he was linking up well and was finding space in and around the box - and it seemed that he was only a game or two away from finding his past world class form. Then he was out with injury for some time. He came back and looked lethargic and slow, which at first we all gave him the benefit of the doubt since he had just come back. Yet it became apparent that something was off when he was routinely getting outmuscled and overmatched against League 2 defenders when we played Cambridge in the FA Cup.

Since then, not much has changed.  He's been in and out of the squad, and when he has been given the chance to prove himself, he's been largely invisible. I always give players the benefit of the doubt - particularly players that are new to the Prem (and coming off a major injury), but with Falcao that necessarily hasn't been the case. He obviously has talent, but it's clear that's he lost a step and doesn't <i>look</i> like the deadly poacher he has been in years past. I wonder if he's one of those players who needs a full year to adapt to a new league - especially a league like the Prem. Although, overpaying to buy him this summer just to see if this was true would potentially be a huge waste of resources.

But I can't help but feel that once he inevitably moves on after this season that he'll be back to his typical scoring ways. It's frustrating because most, if not all of us, thought we were getting a seasoned striker for a pretty good deal last summer. It clearly hasn't worked out, which is unfortunate because when you watch him he definitely gives a lot of effort and you can tell that he cares about the club and winning. On top of that, he has a great character and seems like a genuinely nice guy. It's a real shame things haven't worked out. Falcao is one of those players that every club would want, not just because of his goalscoring, but for his demeanor and character as well (i.e. Juan Mata).

Just my input on things. Thoughts?

9487~~~
Many quality players struggle the first season. I still believe he could be great for us but if we have identified another striker that would do better I´m not gonna cry about it. He is quality, no doubt about it but seems to not fit into our system. I would keep him if it was up to me. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Pretty much nail on head for me. If we can massively reduce the Transfer fee to around 15million or so i'd probably do the deal, But I wouldn't pay over £20million that's for sure as it is still a gamble even for next season and it will depend on how LVG is wanting to play formation wise to.

9489~~~
What's the justification for paying £15m for a player who isn't good enough for us?

9490~~~
Well it's not exactly set in stone that he isn't good enough for us though. He has struggled which everyone has seen but like psuedo's post describes it may be just that it will take some adaptation time and that he may in fact be better next season once he has a pre-season behind him and more importantly a bit of self confidence. If he stays with us and grabs goals in the pre-season tour then that could be the catalyst for a much better season next year. But there are alot of 'if's and but's' with him which is why I wouldn't pay anymore then £15million for him.

9491~~~
In view of the possibility that he may recover from his injury, its worth the punt. Its not like he has no track record and by all accounts, he isnt some big time charlie in the dressing room either.

Jaap Stam took a couple of years to recover much to the regret of Fergie.

9492~~~
I'll be honest, if we were offered Falcao for £15million, I'd take it. Risky? Most definitely. But I'm sure he'll get back to World Class form one day, and maybe it'll happen next season. It's a risk that I personally would be willing to make for £15million. The player Falcao can be is worth treble that, and maybe more.

I know I'm talking foolishness, and it's all hypothetical of course because I doubt we'd be offered to part £15million for him - but meh.

9493~~~
I think Monacco would accept virtually anything they can get for Falcao. 

However Falcao himself will want the same sort of massive wage that he is on right now and there's just no way that makes sense for us. I mean he's one of our biggest earners whilst being one of our least important player. He's the anti-De Gea.

9494~~~
A nearly 30 year old striker, who came to the EPL for all the wrong reasons, the expectations to perform are pretty high (and so is his salary) and he lack pace. That's a recipe for a disaster. Reminds me alot of good old Sheva.

9495~~~
Why would we? He's 29 and his legs are gone. His biggest issue is that he's god damn slow and that not something you regain with time (actually things get worse). The amount of love people tend to have for finished players in here is amazing. Ando, Fletcher, Hargreaves, Falcao...jeez thank god redcafe is not running a glue factory else we would have gone bankrupt by now.

If we want to keep a poacher than we might as well insist on Hernandez. After all chicarito is younger, faster and he's on less salary.

9496~~~
Maybe I'm completely wrong with this, but has he ever really relied much on pace? I thought he was a fast player when he joined, but someone corrected me when we signed him that he's actually not that quick. 

It's shocking for a player to just lose your quality over night, as he did. Torres is an example - but I can't think of another example personally. I do think it's a matter of confidence, which is something he just doesn't have at the moment. The chance he missed against Chelsea - created the space and when 1v1 with Courtouis, he just sliced it completely. 

As I said, £15million is as far as I'd go. But I also said, I'm probably 100% wrong and if it wasn't a hypothetical situation and we were actually offered such a deal, I may not think this.

9497~~~
It could be a mental or a physical thing. However it would be stupid to try our luck with a player whose 29, he's on a ridiculous amount of salary and has been horrible this season expecially since we've already got 2 big names upfront at the same age. 

We need to stop acting like some nursing or retirement home. If a player is not good enough than he leaves. I am sure that they have gained enough money through their career not to end up living under a bridge.

9498~~~
I wouldn't take him for any fee, he's either horribly unsuited to the league, or completely shot. We'd be much better off investing time and money in younger talent.

9499~~~
Not sure if he's unsuitable for the Prem. His problem seems related to a combination of having come off a major injury and nearing 30. If it were just one and not both, he would be more effective.

9500~~~
With Rooney and Van Persie, we don't need another striker of that sort of age. We need a younger one. If he was a success, fine. He's not, time to move on. The price doesn't matter any more, really.

9501~~~
£15 million per year in wages for a striker who doesn't score or assist (after a year on trial), going into his 30's, on the back of a serious serious injury?
Sure. What could possibly go wrong?

It was worth the initial gamble. Time to put our eggs in a different basket.

9502~~~
I agree, I don't see the point in signing a player in his 30s who hasnt done anything to impress on his loan deal, we expected a 20 goal season, 15 goals would have been cool, 10 goals probably have been worth the gamble...heck even 7, he has struggled to get 5 all season, it's time to move on.... If he ends up scoring 50 goals next season for another team then kudos to him.

9503~~~
I'd rather have Danny Ings than Falcao.

That sentence is not one I ever thought I'd type.

9504~~~
He hasn't done anything to suggest that he'll get back to his top form. We could as well sign a 35-year old (FFS, time flies) Ronaldinho and hope he gets back to his former self. Or a 33-year old (he cannot possibly be that age?) Kaka.

9505~~~
I so wanted it to work out, but it hasn't, and likely wouldn't in future.

Don't know why I wrote "serious" twice. Maybe it was even worse than we thought. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9506~~~
Probably worth remembering that before he degraded to something barely resembling a footballer post Jan, he looked fairly decent in the first few months of the season. Nothing special but there was certainly something to work with and signs of his old self.

That said, I saw no point of signing him in the summer and even less point now, even for 15m. If we didn't have Rooney or RVP it might have been worth it but 2 30yrs+ strikers is more than enough I guess.

9507~~~
Can't forget that touch/turn against Sunderland though....Ballon d'or worthy.

9508~~~
If he'd spent this season at Liverpool rather than with us we'd all be laughing our bollocks off and nobody would be suggesting we go in for him, even at £15m.

9509~~~
How many pages can we possibly fill will different variations on "do not want"?

I'm going for at least another 15.

9510~~~
Balotelli comes to mind and he has been better than Falcao

9511~~~
problem is there are actually people here who want to keep him, which is madness. under no circumstances should he be here next season no matter what. not even as a volunteer groundsman.

9512~~~
Surely he wouldn't even want to sign for us, he can't get in the team, the way we play doesn't suit him, neither does the league, money is the only reason for him join which is the same reason he joined Monaco. A free transfer with his wages halved or a loan deal with wages halved would still be a gamble for this guy, talk of 15-20m let alone 40m is crazy.

9513~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9514~~~
Having an exotic name and a Spanish nickname seems to go a long way with some people. Nearly 30, a very serious injury, horrible form and very evident flaws in his game in terms of technique and physicality. You would think twice about signing a former ballon d'or winner in such circumstances, let alone a player with very little experience of the Champions League or title run ins in a major league.

9515~~~
It boggles the mind that any Man Utd fan would want a player like Falcao's current ability at our club.
4 goals in (approximately) half a season is dire.
For next year's title challenge we need a striker who can score at least 15 goals...preferably 20+ goals in a season and this guy is not it.
Every time Falcao is on the pitch, I think to myself, "we are now a man down and we will not score any more goals" and sure enough no more goals are scored.
Its been so long since he scored, I actually can't remember when he last scored.

Here's a breakdown:
4 goals scored in a season, where Costa, Kane and Aguero have 19+. Charlie Austin (who?) has scored 17.
29 years old (so likely to degrade in performance, due to age)
Has showed World class level of skill (that touch against Sunderland), only once this season.
His team-mates generally do not want to pass to him.
If he is signed, he will be working alongside Rooney and RVP, who are also in their 30s and who are both better than him. We dont need another old striker.
His wages are sky high, making him one of the highest paid footballers in the World.
He lacks a track record of performing well in the Champions League.
He was regarded as one of the best strikers on the planet, 2 years ago, which is a long time in football.
He recently played in the U21s and was subbed off due to poor performance.
He has repeatedly demonstrated that he struggles to stay on his feet - ie. he easily goes to ground without any contact. This was demonstrated most recently against Chelsea.
It is questionable whether or not he is able to play well in the EPL - the style of the EPL may not suit him.

In general, due to his age, his pace/acceleration is likely to degrade with age, not improve.
I also want to remind fans that we are not a (small) club where players come to us to recuperate, improve form and then get sold to a big club. We ARE the big club. We can afford to buy the best strikers, 

<b>So, given the above, why would we even consider Falcao (unless on a free transfer and pay as you play contract)?</b>

9516~~~
No it's just some people have common sense. This is no different to the knee jerking towards Fellaini and others. The guy missed a pre season with us. He came into a very poor team and because of the competition in the squad, he's obviously felt the pressure. You might not think we will sign him but that's irrelevant. It's when the player starts thinking it, that you get a problem. You need to balance these things out but you clearly haven't if you think people are biased because of his name. RVP is a big name too as is Rooney but I bet you won't find one person who would think we need all three next season.

Sunama that's true but RVP's figures are down so he must be on the decline right? Why would he do a pay as you play? He's had one injury I think during the season. He's mostly sat out because of us switching players. Everyone knows for Falcao to get in, he will have to dislodge Rooney. Rooney is Lvg's captain, so he's not really got much chance. People look at Tevez and go, "Gee, wonder why he couldn't do it at United?" - it's because he knew he was second choice too Rooney and then we bought Berbatov. Don't underestimate the fact that the guy probably knows he's got little chance staying here.

9517~~~
It's not like Fellaini. At Falcao's age and superstar wages, you can't give him a 12-18 month bedding in period. It's all about the here and now and, unfortunately, he has been way below the standard expected at United. "Common sense" does not dictate spending a fortune on an ageing, injury depleted striker who had made his reputation at clubs a level below United.

9518~~~
Clearest indication yet that we won't be signing him:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/falcao-been-given-chance-insists-9120311" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...news/falcao-been-given-chance-insists-9120311</a>

9519~~~
You know your time is up when they have to bring out the "he's a good person" card to throw some positives out there.

9520~~~
I'm far more disappointed that he has said goodbye to Hernandez

Really think he has a lot still to offer (Hernandez not Falcao)

9521~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> very true. Or people here saying the he isn't the kind to rock the boat in the dressing room. I'll take 300k a week to not rock the boat in the United dressing room.

9522~~~
its not you, its me

9523~~~
Were those quotes from Fridays press conference?

9524~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> so true, if I had a pound for every time I've heard that.....

9525~~~
That's an absolute certainty that we won't sign him. He couldn't say it any clearer without actually saying it.

9526~~~
Seems strange that the MEN are the only ones running these quotes, and they are not the most reliable. Saying that though seems a big quote to make up.

9527~~~
Time to pay us back some of that salary mate.

9528~~~
I think the u18's need a striker, cant the FA make an exception? He's nowhere near good enough to play in the PL, lost the ball everytime.

9529~~~
<b>Fall</b>ca<b>over</b>?

9530~~~
he's so useless with his back to goal. if he just stands still he'll get a free kick but he throws himself forward each time.

9531~~~
No idea why he came on, is a total waste of space.

9532~~~
Is Falcao one of the best examples in a long time that the EPL is a much harder environment to succeed in than other European leagues?

9533~~~
Shevchenko and Crespo come to mind. Atleast Falcao has the excuse of being injured before coming to England

9534~~~
No doubt. His strength was a big asset abroad, not so much now. His injury issues also won't have helped. 

Total passenger so far. No idea why he was brought on.

9535~~~
No. He's an example that despite medical improvements, ACL injuries are damn hard to recover from.

England isn't a harder league to succeed in.

9536~~~
Very true. Its a confidence thing related to his past injury, and he's become an ordinary player as a result.

9537~~~
He's done.

9538~~~
I don't understand at this stage why we are still giving him minutes. You could forgive the lack of goals if he brought pace to the side, creativity or didn't lose every dual he goes in for.

9539~~~
Don't need to see anymore after this game, not sure why we did anyway but with RVP back there absolutely no point, he's just completely toast.

9540~~~
What a finish.

9541~~~
He's been no worse than anyone else. Our play doesn't suit him, we need to supply him with chances and we're completely unable to do so. He's not the sort of striker to create his own chances, and he gets blamed for not being a certain type of player. He'll score goals in a setup more suited to him.

9542~~~
That's what I thought as well. Clear off side, but that was an impeccable finish. He's not been worse than anyone else.

9543~~~
Fair enough, but he's also had zero good performances this season, so there'll be less of a tendency to cut him some slack. Understandably in my opinion.

9544~~~
Where is Wilson? I'd much rather him be playing.

9545~~~
I honestly wish I could earn that much being as poor at my job. It's astonishing. 300kpw for falling over a few times giving an impression of trying? Incredible!

9546~~~
I don't care what he would do elsewhere, for us he has been absolutely useless and we are a worse team every time he is on the pitch, spends more time on the floor than any striker I have ever seen.

9547~~~
Absolutely useless, it really annoys me how many times he comes on and does nothing. Fair enough, he doesn't get many chances, but is it so much to ask to play football without slipping over and falling on your face? It's just sad how much he regressed.

9548~~~
Despite this you just know he will play a part in the next 4 games. It's a total joke. I thought this manager was all about performances and not big names.

9549~~~
Yeah... If Falcao hadn't come on, we'd have played better, as we did in that first half, right?

9550~~~
A complete waste of space.

9551~~~
He looks like a championship level striker, he's been dreadful all year the sooner he fecks off the better. £200k a week....what a joke.

9552~~~
He's been better than Di Maria today.

9553~~~
What the hell are you talking about? I'm just saying he's been very poor and he still manages to come on every single match to do nothing.

9554~~~
Well considering we were worse in the second half then we were in the first...

9555~~~
Looked better than Rooney up top but let's not let reality get in the way

9556~~~
Think i'd near rather play with 10 men

9557~~~
Anyway, he's absolute feckin' garbage. One of the worst players I've ever seen play for Manchester United.

9558~~~
I'll break it down for you. Rooney, who's been poor upfront since the game against Spurs, was poor again today, so our manager decided to bring on our other fit striker to see if things would change.

We were no better with Falcao than we were without, no harm done.

9559~~~
I can't think of a worse number 9 for us.

Even Alan Smith looked better.

9560~~~
One of the worst performances I've seen from a striker. Torresesque

9561~~~
Why is he still getting minutes? The finish was nice but I really hope he's not starting at home if Rooney isn't fit.

9562~~~
Reckon he should go the the states be a star over there and still collect his wages

Not sure who in Europe will give him what he wants

9563~~~
I don't think he would have gotten so many chances to prove himself at any other top club. Should have been frozen out of the squad months ago.

9564~~~
We did feck all in the first half, hence the score line. It's all good and well keeping the ball, but we played into Everton's hands as we did Chelsea's, last week.

9565~~~
Is Rooney meant to be any better in midfield? At least rooney can score and set up goals upfront even if he's playing poor

9566~~~
The three Chelsea failures, Torres, Shev and Crespo all looked better than Falcao unfortunately

9567~~~
Each and every game he's getting better. At the art of being invisible.

9568~~~
We did even less in the second. In the first half we actually made 2 or 3 decent chances.

9569~~~
It's all well and good saying our style of play doesn't suit him or we don't create chances for him when the guy can't do a simple task like hold up a fecking ball.

He falls over, the ball bounces off him instead of sticking, if he gets a chance he fluffs it, he gets bullied around by very average defenders, he falls over some more. What is his game exactly? Because it's not like has the pace to get in behind defences anymore, he's not a hold up player, he's not a good dribbler. I'm pretty sure 90% of strikers at this levels would play well in teams that lay on a constant flow of chances but how many of those teams actually exist?

He got a bad injury and isn't the same player anymore, it sucks but its fact.

9570~~~
Every game he comes on and it's pretty much the same. His runs aren't great, he gets out muscled pretty easily, all in all it turns out to be pretty pointless to bring him on. Fine if we are winning but it's pretty evident by now that he's not going to help us claw a goal back.

9571~~~
Yeah he was poor, but so was the whole fecking team, bit unfair to just target him, but then again he has been the whipping boy this season.

9572~~~
He's shite. The worst thing is you know he's shite, but you know that by the law of averages he must have a decent game once in a while. Never fecking happens.

9573~~~
He's barely recognisable as the guy who played at Porto and Atletico, lethal finishing from pretty much any situation.

Now it's just little bursts of movement here and there and the ball bouncing off him.

9574~~~
The thought of him playing for us next season is a little scary. Why are we still playing him? It’s unlikely that RvP wasn’t fit for 45 minutes.

9575~~~
I must admit, this thread has cheered me up a bit. Genuine amusement from the people <i>still</i> defending him. FML.

9576~~~
I don't think his strength is coming to midfield to get the ball. Would rather have Chicarito back for us

9577~~~
I agree every time he received the ball he either falls over, gets pushed off it or just passes it straight back, he never brings runners in or turns his man, things Rooney did in the first half. He has been a total disaster for us, shouldn't even be coming on a sub.

9578~~~
It is kind of sad really. Seeing such a great player become this. 

As long as he is not in the Premier League next season I would like to see him do well for whoever he plays for.

9579~~~
This isn't the only thread people are discussing poor performances in (I point you to the Blind/McNair/Valencia etc. threads)...

9580~~~
That first half performance was garbage, though and our second half performance managed to eclipse it, somehow.

9581~~~
I liked the idea he was played to please his (and DDGs) agent, but now that it seems DDG is on his bike I really have no answer to that mystery. He's been paid a few millions in wages since his last shot on target.

9582~~~
Seriously, I'll take 280k a week to just fall on my ass over and over and over and over. Why are we still bothering? Look, he seems like a nice lad but why are we persisting? He won't be here next season. The punt was fun when it started but it's time to stop.

9583~~~
It's an absolute joke. Just suck the defeat cause that second half had absolute nothing to do with him. Whether he's here or not is another matter. Probably not but People have gone completely overboard with Falcao, we took a gamble but all he's cost us his wages. Take a look at ADM who we've paid £60m for....

9584~~~
Manchester United's very own Shevchenko.

9585~~~
Awful.

Wilson deserves his place on the bench. Send Falcao to Monaco.

9586~~~
I assume he's not far from his last game in a United shirt, as RVP nears his return to fitness. At least in replacing Falcao's 60 min sub role anyway.

9587~~~
It's hard to see how he could be any worse. Maybe he will score an own goal that costs us CL qualification.

9588~~~
It had nothing to do with him but he made no difference and contributed nothing, for 250k a week when you consistently do that it's not good enough, same goes for di Maria both are stealing a living at the moment.

He was as ever useless, no point trying to argue otherwise.

9589~~~
Plays as bad as he looks. What a nothing player.

9590~~~
Steals a living at the moment.

9591~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> this thread is absolute comedy, the team were poor today therefore the striker will suffer, Falcao wasn't terrible considering his lack of consistent game time compared to the others.

We didn't even look dangerous near the end, we didn't want to win, there really is little to say about him today because he wasn't to blame for our loss and he didn't do anything worthy of praise. We could have had a fit Diego Costa as our 9 and we still would have lost.

Fans ever in the search for players to vent their frustration on.

9592~~~
Should not play again unless we have a major injury crisis. He's useless and couldn't buy a goal.

9593~~~
Falcao hasnt had a shot on target in over 6 hours. Nevermind a goal. That is utterly indefensible.

9594~~~
So you would sooner play players who will earn 50k per week and praise them even if we lose because they tried hard? It's not a question of money, it's a question of performance, today he was no poorer than the team in general, due to Falcao's performances his contract will not be renewed at the end of the season but until then as a club we must honour it. If we paid Fellaini 250k per week I do not think that would improve his performance much so it's not important right now, we know what type of player Falcao is and he needs service.

As far as the team were concerned the statement 'he made no difference and contributed nothing' could be made to most, as Louis van Gaal continually stresses this is a <i>team</i> game and not one of individuals, sometimes it is apparent in a good performing team a player or two have a bad game but today the team was not performing well, Falcao was not the stand out bad player on the pitch that cost us the game although reading this thread suggests he was.

9595~~~
why do we still play him?  Play someone who might actually be here next year.  LVG doesn't always, or even often, impress me with his decisions.

9596~~~
I'm not defending his <i>recent</i> performances, I'm saying criticising him as an individual makes me question what match you were watching. Do you think Falcao was considerably worse than the team in general? And if not then blame the team not the player, it is after all as our manager keeps saying a team game.

And when he headed the ball to try and lob Howard, if that's not a shot on target then you use some weird stats to measure things , even against Chelsea he hit the post from a tight angle and while not a shot on target that was very close to going in, let's not assume that is any worse than Osman's shot which De Gea caught easily but would qualify in your eyes as a shot on target.

9597~~~
Don't besmirch Sheva's good name like that.

9598~~~
When I saw him coming on my heart sank, we were 2-0 down and LvG decided to play the 2nd half with 10 men.

9599~~~
Yes. He gets knocked over every time touches him witha feather and we have a youth product in the name of Wilson who cant possibly be worse AND actually has a future here.

9600~~~
I kind of hate myself for being very excited every time he's subbed on, or starts a game, only to roll my eyes and sigh every time he misplaces a pass or falls over. I'm certain that he'll have a great season next season, for whichever team, yet I cant really see what he brings to any team these days.

9601~~~
Because he is the other number 9 the manager feels most likely to score, the manager who observes training daily. Perhaps RVP has been injured recently or something and the manager prefers Falcao to Wilson at the moment, he still has the task of getting us top four, Liverpool by winning their game in hand are 4 points behind us now with 4 to go, I think the manager wants to make sure he is here next year before playing the players that will be!

9602~~~
Would rather play Grimshaw up front than him, he's dire and shoudln't be nowhere near the club. We have the most overrated attacking options from all top teams

9603~~~
Does nothing. Offers nothing. No pace. Very few runs in behind, because he doesn't have the pace to cause problems by running in behind. Doesn't cause problems physically. We were playing a lot better before he came on.

Would rather see Wilson get minutes ahead of him. Hell, I would rather play Fellaini as a striker.

9604~~~
No idea where you got that from to be honest, I wouldn't praise anyone today but falcao was pathetic today as he has been pretty much all the time, thats a fact whether the team has been playing well or not. Of course money matters for 250k a week he should be starting or at least be able to come on and have an impact because if he isn't that money can be spent on players that can offer that.

Anyway Whether we are paying him 250k a week or zero fact is he is useless and shouldn't be even brought on as a sub, plenty of others didn't contribute today but they have done in other games, falcao hasn't so that's why he gets criticism because it's the same rubbish even in the u21's.

9605~~~
Disappointed to see him get minutes again today. He is not a suitable plan B.

9606~~~
'Every Time', well I didn't watch the match you were playing. 

And Liverpool will be 4 points behind us with 4 to play so sorry the manager wants to make sure his job is secure before playing our youth products <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Anyway if you think Falcao was considerably worse than the team in general then there is little point in continuing this discussion, United were poor in my opinion, you must listen too much to Brentan Rodgers.

9607~~~
Why are you laughing? Did you or I say something funny?

9608~~~
Why was Falcao pathetic? Unless we were creating chances for fun and he was missing them?

So if money matters we must judge the players in relation to their wages and not the performance we expect of a team challenging for top four, I respectfully disagree with this notion, it's not the way to secure top four and I'm glad we have a manager that agrees with me, he has been fond of letting us know it matters not whether a player cost 5k or 50m.

9609~~~
The man has lost it.  Maybe he finds it again somewhere else, but there's really no point in Louis playing him again.

9610~~~
He had a shot on target when he came on you plank.

Massive overreaction in this thread IMO. We never looked like getting in behind and he managed to split the two CBs within 10 minutes, and it also allowed Rooney to start receiving the ball in space deeper than previously. Honestly don't think he did that bad when he came on.

9611~~~
I just found it funny you think the manager should play youth prospects like Wilson (or players who will be here next season) as opposed to ensuring he will still be in a job.

My opinion is that his objective is top four, Liverpool with victory in their game in hand are 4 points behind us with 4 to play (we have Pulis' WBA, Pardiola's Palace away, Wenger's Arsenal and Bruce's relegation threatened Hull away), therefore I think he should be fully focused on doing what he thinks will get us points and clearly Falcao due to match rhythm was above both Wilson and RVP in the pecking order, he felt Fellaini was ineffective therefore he wanted to drop Rooney into midfield in the hope of having a 10 that offered more, his decision to play Falcao over a young player with potential was logical.

9612~~~
What does he do other than fall over, give the ball away or just pass it back to where it comes from. Never holds the ball up, never turns a man, never beats a man, completely pointless being on the pitch. What striker does get chances created for fun week in week out, total nonsense, all strikers have to work for goals and contribute to the team.

Well of course it matters how much money someone earns,  when the club are assessing whether to keep him it will be incredibly relevant how much money he costs and at the moment he isn't worth even a token amount. FFP, budgets are all part of football, if you can spend money better why buy him? Ultimately if he was scoring goals it wouldn't matter but he isnt and hasn't all season so sooner he is gone the better.

9613~~~
So change hasn't to didnt and my point still stands. That's an awful return.

9614~~~
I said it before today, I can't see him scoring again for us.

9615~~~
Youre missing the point - Falcao doesnt help us, thus his presence wont help us achieve top 4. No question Wilson, even Fellaini would be a better option in his place.

Wilson probably has as many goals as him anyway and at the very least has pace to stretch defenders.

9616~~~
Typical that the only bit of class I've seen from him and he was offside by a mile.

9617~~~
Seems to be a gamble that hasn't paid off in the end.

I just have this strong feeling that his next move will see him back to a good level.

9618~~~
I dunno how long this will keep going, but the fact that LVG keeps playing him can become a source of growing discontent in the dressing room. It's better for all parties involved that the divorce is pronounced now.

9619~~~
To be fair, I think the dressing room loves him so that's a plus.

9620~~~
I don't see exactly how nobody in the dressing room is infuriated at how he does feck all while others are waiting their turn.<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

9621~~~
Who exactly is waiting that would be infuriated?

9622~~~
I agree to some extent, and Im sure theres some of that.

But today's bench... Could rvp, januzaj or di maria really say they have done more this season to warrant an appearance?

Adnan hasnt had a lot of games to be fair but he just hasnt looked the same as last year.

9623~~~
In this case, Wilson. While Van Persie was injured, Falcao kept doing nothing whenever he was called. So it would have been natural for Wilson to be picked at least a couple of times ahead of Falcao for whatever purpose there was (bringing something different, rub salt in Falcao's wounds with hope of bring him back with the mindset of a wounded animal, etc).

I can agree about Adnan and Van Persie for obvious reasons. However, Di Maria manages to earn those assists on the scoresheet a little bit like Mata does. Even before Van Persie took back a place on the bench, I would have preferred to see Wilson on a couple of times more.

9624~~~
Yeah fair enough. Im one of Wilson's more vocal supporters here and I too feel he should be given a chance over Falcao.

9625~~~
Guys, when was the last time we scored, while Falcao was on the pitch (either he scored or another player)?

9626~~~
Ander Herrera's injury time goal against Aston Villa around 3 weeks ago.

9627~~~
To be fair, he had to get the feck out the way for Herrera to shoot.

9628~~~
The Fellaini of last season.

9629~~~
It just hurts to see him play like this. I want him to score so badly but its just embarrassing to see him on the field most of times.

9630~~~
It's amazing how bad he is given how good he was. It's sad to see.

9631~~~
He started one game recently and tends to play 10-15 minute cameos when the team just sit back and wait for the final whistle. Harsh to blame Falcao for that.

9632~~~
His introduction stifles us........would have rathered seen RVP.

9633~~~
If Adnan had actually looked anything remotely decent last week then he might of got minutes today, his pace would if been a big plus point. But he was awful so he is going to have a bit of a wait now it looks like.

9634~~~
He's had feck all service, it's not like he's spurning gilt edged chance after chance.  I really don't see who in the dressing room would be so frustrated.  Better to have an experienced head who is here on loan feeding off scraps, rather than damaging the confidence of someone like Wilson who is our player, and emerging.

9635~~~
Well he did score on the play that was offside. I was actually surprised he didn't miss.

9636~~~
I think if this went in his entire season would have been different. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xlZvm9dYWWQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

9637~~~
He's been a victim of our impotent playstyle. He was played early in the season when were still finding our feet. To some extent we still are finding our feet but the wins over Spurs, Liverpool and City show we're well on our way. But it doesn't excuse his inability to hold up the ball and to take his chances when they've been presented to him. Cruel because of how inconsistently he's been involved but for a striker of his pedigree and wage, we expect him to do just that. Loses possession so easily it's unbelievable. I don't like it that he plays with his back to goal so much but that's partially a fault of our lack of players willing to try an incisive and direct ball into space. Especially today.

9638~~~
In answer to the OP even Drogba would have been a better option for us this season.

9639~~~
I'm baffled as to why Van Gaal keeps playing him in recent games.

Is he still going to be here next season or what? I do have a feeling we have to play him x amount of games as a part of the loan deal or something.

9640~~~
Most unfortunate player ever. Every time he plays we don't create any chances for him and they make a world class super striker look like a busted flush who  has the first touch of a landmine. 

Poor bloke. We should sign him to apologise.

9641~~~
I can kind of understand why LVG put him on. RVP was totally out of match practise. Falcao is supposedly fit and one of those players who has/had immense talent, and I suppose as a manager you just hope that suddenly things click, because if they did, he would be lethal. It's just not happening, but by goodness I still think it was worth a try when we signed him on loan. It might have been great...unfortunately I don't think we or anyone else will see the full Falcao again. Lovely guy..but just not happening.

9642~~~
Is Wilson injured? If not he should have been playing these last few weeks instead of Falcao. If Rooney misses next week, RVP please.

9643~~~
Same sh*t. Different day.

9644~~~
In fairness, he has shown glimpses of what he can do.
The problem is that he doesnt do this often enough. 
It also doesnt help that everybody expects him to perform like a "Galactico", so when we see him struggle against lesser teams/defenders, we berate him for it.

9645~~~
Not really, we were all happy to see him sign & had high expectations. Fellaini had a poor reception from many of our supporters.
I do wonder how he's getting chances from the bench, he's been incredibly poor for such a once talented player. 
He is rightly being criticised.

9646~~~
Indeed, Fellaini was not wanted from day 1. Falcao on the other hand, <i>still</i> has people on here defending him after another abject performance, based on reputation alone.

9647~~~
He is a goner... and will not be missed at all. 

I see some people think he will be better next season if he stays... You don't buy a player for 40-50 million and blindly hope he will turn good again. Money better spent elsewhere.

9648~~~
Ridiculous he still gets to play.  If he fecking stays I will lose my shit.

9649~~~
He must be gone, wrong player for us in terms of his playing style and his age given the age of RVP and Rooney, factor in he has been useless and it's almost unthinkable he will be here next season.

9650~~~
The thing I object to is how anyone can legitimately be getting paid £250,000 per week (approx) for this.

Thats an annual salary of about £12,000,000 pre-tax. Twelve million pounds. For what?
Of course the same argument exists for pretty much every footballer that they dont deserve the money they are on, but its just sickening to think of it in cases like this.

9651~~~
He's not even remotely close to Tevez and his past impact on the team. Waste of people's time.

Should have kept Chicha and he would outscore that shite in a few months.

9652~~~
I don't care about the 250k a week. Money doesn't equate to rock all in football. It's not worked out, I except that but today, how can anyone criticise that performance. He had feck all to work with and the passing and crossing was so poor. 
I stand by it though, the majority of fans on here and that rock up at OT never believed in Felliani and Young last season. Both showed absolutely nothing last season and the majority wanted them gone. These are the same people that are saying that we wouldn't have won most of the games in the latest run in without their input. What's the difference with Falcao.....? It's clear we or anyone else are not going to pay 40m for him

9653~~~
FTFY

9654~~~
Brazilian Ronaldo in his heyday would look awful in our team. I still cannot see why most do not realize that the fault lies in the lack of creativity of our central midfielders. Our best striker performance for the year was RVP's 2 goals against Southampton and in that game he basically made the goals for himself.
Falcao should not play again this season because he is wasted and has lost all his confidence because of our woeful central midfield.
Mata and Herrera will ensure we dominate possession but what the heck they do with it is a completely different thing.

9655~~~
Appalling. i would rather have torres.

9656~~~
He obviously isn't good playing with his back to goal but I still can't believe how weak he is. He's got a stocky frame yet gets bullied off the ball every bloody time.

9657~~~
Rubbish. R9 was the complete striker. In his heyday he had it all; shooting, dribbling, control, speed, strength. Far more than a six yard box poacher.

9658~~~
Nonsense.

9659~~~
Young and fellaini aren't success stories yet, both have plenty more to prove before they canned labelled that, let's see if they can keep up their recent performances (both have been poor last two games even) it's taken nearly 4 years for young to play at a decent level, falcao doesn't have that kind of time.

He offers nothing to the midfield and gives them nothing to work with, ca t hold the ball up, can't run, can't turn his man, must be a nightmare to play with.

He did nothing today just as he has done in pretty much very other game, that's why he can be criticised. Others were poor today but have been better at other times aNd that can't be said about falcao. He is also nearly 29, has had three serious knee injuries and hasn't proven he has recovered from the last one. Put it all together and no reason for him to be here next season because we can get someone better just as we could have had someone better than young for last few seasons.

9660~~~
I backed him for ages, really hoping he would succeed here, but I realised some time around January that he was done, and I believed from then there would be no chance in us signing him permanently.

I see little point in us persisting to play him. I'd rather Wilson was given the minutes. Even an RvP lacking full fitness would surely be better.

9661~~~
So he lost his confidence cause of our midfield?

Interesting theory.Nothing to do with injury or sthing like that?

You said it yourself RVP made the goals by himself, Falcao cant do even that. 

And you're underestimating Ronaldo if you think he'd look awful in our team. 

Our midfield doesnt create enough but to say he lost his confidence cause of it is.. 
Well wrong.

9662~~~
That's laughable, you can't have seen him play to say something like that. It's ludicrous this idea that no other striker could possibly do more than falcao, most of the strikers in the league could.

9663~~~
I wish it worked out for him here but its not to be, he doesnt suit our play and we dont suit his play

9664~~~
Ok the Brazilian Ronaldo was a bit too much of an exaggeration but do not lose sight of my point in that our main problem is the lack of creativity of our central midfielders

9665~~~
When he comes on these days i'm like Oh No. And he is fecking slow and all he seems to do when he gets the ball is just pass it to the nearest man backwards.

Atleast even with Hernandez you felt he would get a goal and give more movement when he came on.

9666~~~
That's part of the problem but still -



Also his movement and hold up play seems so snail like.

9667~~~
Well I think Louis van Gaal thinks otherwise. The very player he replaced was Fellaini so your disagreement also seems to be with the manager, a man who in my opinion knows what he is doing.

9668~~~
He's hit the post last week against Chelsea?

9669~~~
That's not a shot on target.

9670~~~
We are talking about Falcao's performance in this match, he didn't 'just fall over, give the ball away and just pass it back', go and watch the match again <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You are talking about the future, I have made clear in another post already his contract obviously won't be renewed, how much he earns should not relate to the level of criticism he receives for his most recent performance.

Falcao was not a standout poor performer in that team today.

9671~~~
Didn't know that. Weird to draw the line there.

9672~~~
Not really sure why Falcao's getting the grief today tbh. He came on at 2-0, with the team playing crap, and basically did exactly what he's done all season. I.e look like a player that is horribly past it.

Surely no one actually expected him to change the game today?

9673~~~
Not really, if it was on target it would go in.

9674~~~
The only way I think he can stay on now is if we can have him for £20m plus £100k a week wages!!!


If not good luck to him where ever he goes....

9675~~~
Not really. Shot going in = on target, shot not going in = shot off target. It would be odd to do it any other way.

9676~~~
Im not questioning LVG in general, but on this, he is plainly wrong. A striker who is so far off the pace that he cant even get shots off anymore is not something any team needs. Nevermind a striker who doesnt score.

9677~~~
That's exactly what he does, didn't do anything good today and hasn't done for a long time, watch game again yourself and you will see him do exactly what I said he does.

Money matters if that needs explaining I don't know where to start, expectation levels as going to be higher for high profile, highly paid star players, he is nowhere near that and isn't even playing at the standard of a half decent backup, laughable you think otherwise.

9678~~~
When you are earning £280k a week and have a £43million tag on you, then yes I expect you to change the damn game.

9679~~~
You can count on a hand how many times he's shown his Atletico form. Its pathetic how bad he is now.

9680~~~
So if it hits the post and goes in its not an on-target goal, a sort of deflection<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

9681~~~
He's a complete and utter busted flush. Everyone can see it. He's done, finished.

I honestly don't expect anything from anymore. Quite frankly, I'm just pleased when he manages to control the ball, or pass to a teammate.

9682~~~
In off the post is a shot on target.

9683~~~
That's fine but he is the man who observes Falcao in training each day <i>and</i> still has a job to secure, he's not playing him for fun. And let's face it, the team was poor today, even the on form player who he replaced, Falcao's performance really wasn't that bad considering what we served up.

Maybe you think Rooney played well as the 9, I don't know.

9684~~~
I watched the game again, I saw him shoot and hit the target and make mostly successful passes, you didn't say he does this! You said he just falls over, loses possession and passes it back (well he is a striker in a possession based system so I don't think this is actually a criticism).

How many players did play well today? Surely he has been doing <i>something</i> to have been the manager's choice to replace the undroppable one at 45 minutes.

What exactly did you expect him to do in that team today? I'm not saying he was good but I am saying he wasn't poorer than anybody else, whether it be Blind or Rooney, that team was poor. 

So you are saying we <i>should</i> compare Falcao to his fee? And other players to theirs? Well thankfully the manager doesn't think like that, he has an expectation and either you meet it or you don't regardless of your fee, he wants to look onto the football pitch and judge the football.

Obviously it goes without saying when it comes to renewing contracts and stuff then you look at the cost of the player but in terms of judging Falcao's performance against Everton, his fee really doesn't have anything to do with it, just like the manager looked at his performance against Chelsea and training before judging where he ranks in his selection and not at his wage bill!

So in short, I don't think we should renew his contract as that's obvious, he was not worse than his team mates today despite what reading this thread suggests and no the performances of the players against Everton really shouldn't be judged in relation to their wage bill.

9685~~~
Absolutely agree. I'm not a fan but he's no way near as bad as people make out. I'd argue he's got better but people seem to think amidst poor performances across the team, he must be better because we are paying him 250k a week. I'm not sure what we expected from him this season? Let's be honest, for 60% of this season we have been poor and this hasn't been nothing to do with Falcao.

9686~~~
Even that would be overpaying. Which of his qualities are worth £20m?

9687~~~
What team would suit his play? He can't even control the ball these days.

9688~~~
Good post. He's had a poor year, but that's completely independent of the fact that random posters jump into this thread to have a go at him in matches where most of the team were poor.

9689~~~
Was disappointed when we brought him on, as it is largely like playing a man down when he is on the park at times and teams are simply looking to defend deep and hit us on the counter like today. He really needs to work on his ability to hold up the ball in this system as fairly often the ball is played into his feet with a defender at hi back and he can't hold onto it and pass it off. 

Though it was good to see him hit the back of the net, even if he was offside at the time. Hopefully that will give him a small boost of confidence.

9690~~~
City, all they do is get to the byline and low cross for aguero

9691~~~
I don't want him anywhere near this club.  We've had enough dead weight to carry while we're hoping they come good.  We've only just got rid of a load.   

Wish him the best wherever he goes, but it would be absolutely ridiculous if we pay any money or even waste a squad allocation on him.

9692~~~
Also easy to take a dig at strikers when there are so few chances created. They look sort of "helpless" when we have those kind of games. United have been absolutely lousy this season at creating good chances. I'd like to know how many goals we've scored where a player only needed to put it past the keeper.

9693~~~
Imagine if we sign him, just imagine.

9694~~~
I can't imagine signing him up, we should get someone young and talented instead of him.

9695~~~
"Falcao has been given the chance to be in the team this season. You can say he is unlucky – he has the quality to play," Van Gaal said as <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/radamel-falcao-heading-man-united-5583240" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">quoted by the Mirror.</a>

"I like him and the way he played against Chelsea last week. He was unlucky he didn't score. I like Falcao as a human being, just as I like Danny Welbeck and Chicharito (Hernandez), they are always professional."

"But when you are not in the team for season after season, there comes a time when you need a challenge. That's why I have said goodbye to Welbeck and Chicharito. And now I have to talk with Falcao," he added.

9696~~~
Does that mean he needs to say goodbye to him? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

9697~~~
Obviously!

It was a gamble. It didn't work out.

9698~~~
Not his fault today but in general, he hasnt been good enough. Time to move somewhere else

9699~~~
Every time he recieved the ball in a tight spot he just lost it, thought this guy had some strength about him when he was at Atleti..

9700~~~
Can´t remember being more let down by any United player in recent years. Most of us here had really high hopes for him and he just isn´t anywhere close being United´s class. Unlucky or not he has had his chances, now it´s time to cut our losses and find someone who might acctually score for a change.

9701~~~
So because the team was poor, we shouldn't criticise him? Guessing we shouldn't be critical of anyone then.

9702~~~
If the team are not attacking with purpose or showing desire (according to the manager we had less than the opposition) then the striker isn't going to do much.

If that was Wilson or RVP that came on and did little because the team were simply outplayed I wouldn't see the point in criticising them, what would I expect them to do? I wouldn't criticise Rooney either and he played that role in the first half.

When Bayern dealt with Xavi in 2013, I didn't criticise Messi or the Barcelona attack, I did criticise their midfield for losing key battles, the same was true of Real Madrid that season.

Falcao's performance was average, I certainly wouldn't praise him for it but I also can't see what he did that deserves criticism. He came on, looked to get in behind the defence, moved around looking for spaces to attack, dropped deep when he was needed and circulated possession as Louis van Gaal likes and even his chance from Angel di Maria was good improvisation but Howard read his intentions well.

I would have expected Wilson or RVP or Rooney to do that too, it's kind of the role. When the team attack with aggression then the striker comes alive.

9703~~~
Seems like it. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

9704~~~
Fair point

9705~~~
The excuses offered up for Falcao are looking less and less creditable imo.

Don't see how his ineffectiveness can still be blamed on other players. Just a few weeks ago when he wasn't in the team people were claiming his poor season was because he had been misused and if he was given a chance as the lone forward in our current system he would prove his class. Well he's had that chance the last two games and looked as feeble as ever.

9706~~~
The question I pose is this;

If it were not Falcao, but Hernandez or Welbeck who had put in these performances all season - would the same people still be defending him and coming up with the same reasons (I dont want to call them excuses...but..) for their performances?

I am inclined to say no. I think Falcao's reputation has tinted the view of some people, who were/are so desperate for him to succeed, and saw his signing as such a coup, that they cant quite believe what has happened.

9707~~~
I wonder how many times has he played with Carrick on the field. RVP always looked more dangerous when Carrick played. I don't remember seeing Carrick playing with Falcao.

9708~~~
Nail on the head. He's living off of his reputation, and what if scenarios.

9709~~~
His got a proven track record, yes his had a shit season but last year so did Young and Fellaini and look at them now...

9710~~~
We've already shelled out a lot of money this season alone based on his track record, to splash out any more would be stupid. He's shown very little. I'd rather Wilson got his minutes, or Ings for free. Also from the van Gaal quotes he'll have to acdept a super sub role. If that's the case is rather keep Chicharito. At least he scores lots of goals even with a bit part role, and he has pace.

9711~~~
He didnt play too badly yesterday (or against Chelsea); he played in-line with all our other players.
The problem is we want a game changer. We are buying into a big name and expect a big performance. A man who can single-handedly win us a game.

3 examples:
Hazard did this for Chelsea last week. 
When Ings played against us at Old Trafford, he made impact.
I did notice that when Mirallas came on (for Everton), he made immediate impact (I think within 6 minutes).

In all these games Falcao was on the pitch and made no impact.

Other examples of game changers:
Aguero regularly does this for Man City. 
Kane does this for Tottenham. 
De Gea has done this previously for us.
Costa does this for Chelsea.

People are getting far too fixated on 1 or 2 game performances. You have to look at the bigger picture and not just 1 or 2 game performances.
Falcao is makes zero impact in our games and based on this, we should not buy him.

9712~~~
I am sorry for Wilson

9713~~~
Even then though, that doesn't excuse for the fact that Falcao's generally been very poor whenever he's played for us. He'd perhaps have a couple more goals if he'd played with Carrick more often, but I'm not sure it'd have had <i>that </i>much of an impact.

9714~~~
Its a shame that goal he scored yesterday was offside, it would of been funny seeing how many people changed their mind on him and wanted him to stay.

9715~~~
It was a very good finish, to be fair.

9716~~~
It was a brilliant finish but as usual with Falcao, there is always a down side to everything he does, being offside was this one.

9717~~~
Even if he scored yesterday I feel as though he is not good enough for us. He just does not look like the same player he once was in any department....except for maybe passion....I really like the guy and wished it worked out

9718~~~
I know it's only Youtube, but how on earth can you go from the magnificent, clever and lethal goalscorer in this video, to the shambles we're seeing now? it happened Torres too, but it's still quite baffling how far they fell. Surely you'd still retain at least some quality.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xCmk96_Pfpg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

9719~~~
Plenty of fans liked and defended Welbeck and Hernandez until even after they left us. Hernandez a little less so but he was still liked and defended for what he did. In fact, there are still fans who wouldn't be averse to taking him back next season as an option.

9720~~~
I am one of them <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

9721~~~
So case in point, those players were offering up games where their touches were terrible, they were missing easy chances and generally looking below the standard of a top United striker and they <i>were</i> being defended. You asked the question and you're one of the fans who has and did defend them.

9722~~~
And Shevchenko and Morientes.

9723~~~
You just know we won't sign him and he'll go off somewhere else and become a world beater again.

9724~~~
I dont think Hernandez or Welbeck achieved quite the depths that Falcao has.
Welbeck could always be relied on for his all-round player and contribution, even if his finishing was poor.
Hernandez has <i>always</i> been a good goal poacher when he has been given the chance.

Put either of them in instead of Falcao this season and I think they would have achieved more, in some way shape or form.

9725~~~
No one fell harder than Torres...after that leg injury he simply was never the same again....and before that he was the deadliest striker in european football. Falco was amazing and one of the best #9's ever....but Torres was the best for me.

I cannot figure out what the hell happened to Shevchenko.

9726~~~
Plus they were yong and lernin. You could forgive iffy performances on the basis they would almost certainly improve in the future. It's the doubts over Falcao's capacity to improve that makes it hard to be positive about him.

9727~~~
I wouldn't bank on it.

9728~~~
Neither Young nor Fallaini had a potentially career-ending injury though.

If he were merely struggling for form that'd be something you could take on board but he's clearly struggling with his body and sadly the Prem wasn't the league to come to for the first time following such a bad injury.

9729~~~
Probably none.

9730~~~
Both moved to different clubs and haven't had much more success than Falcao has this season and neither of them were rushed back from career threatening knee injury like Falcao was. 

If we want to compare direct scenarios, I think Falcao would've done better for Real this season than Hernandez has but that's completely hypothetical. 

I don't think you're original point held much weight but I agree with Pogue, Welbeck and Hernandez were very different scenarios than Falcao and at completely different stages in their career.

9731~~~
Also true.

9732~~~
really? to be his 5th goal by end of April?
If that changed anyone's mind they have to have questions asked.

9733~~~
Not sure why no one is seemingly bothered that he's stood 5 yards offside and not making any real effort to get back onside...

9734~~~
Injuries and age.

9735~~~
he's been disappointingly but he's not alone. There's been more that have than haven't at most clubs. Then you have the 'wonder season' only to be found out the next. Must be difficult coming into a new country, new culture, new manager finding himself in a new team. A new team getting use to a new manager, new league yet alone finding your fitness. Not to mention the team being completely crap for half the season, it's hardly like we were flying. Again not to mention, wouldn't you need a proper run of games to find your form? Can you find your form with 15 and 20min cameos?

9736~~~
All these excuses for a World Class player.... perfectly written though, its just sad that every single point just happens to be an excuse.

9737~~~
Only playing 20 minutes automatically means you can't control a football, pass a football, shoot on target or run without falling over,

9738~~~
Im as disappointed as any but I remember a time when we use to give people a season to find their feet and that was a fact rather than an excuse. Despite how much money you pay people, it takes time to get use to this league if you've never played in it. Some never do. No don't he's struggled but look at the Chelsea and Everton game, there is improvement. Unfortunately he's missing a bit of luck but that happens in football.
Unfortunately, the momentum of negativity as swung against him in a way different to ADM who cost us 60m.
It's funny cause if you listen enough to the negativity about players, it's easy to agree than challenge it. In most recent times, DDG, Felliani and Young. Where are those people standing by there strong views now? Has Felliani learnt how to play football overnight cause I remember the clips in the CL game of him running the ball out of play. I read the post that Young was stealing a living. Where are those posters now standing by their assessment of those players now?

I'm sure they'll have their own set of excuses for why their assessments of those players were wrong......

9739~~~
I think we should sack LVG. How could he possibly play a footballer that can't play football?

9740~~~
Disappointing thing is he gets worse every game somehow. When he first played he was fine. He was unlucky not to score against Leicester and made a good assist.

Since the turn of the year he has been awful. Newcastle at home was his last decent game.

9741~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.talkingbaws.com/2015/04/27/louis-van-gaal-says-falcao-can-be-a-manchester-united-starter-but-chicharito-cant/?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.talkingbaws.com/2015/04/...nchester-united-starter-but-chicharito-cant/?</a>

van Gaal wants Falcao rather than Chicho.....and I tend to agree...

9742~~~
Ah those were the days when Falcao was batman and Costa was just his sidekick.

9743~~~
Fellaini and Young improved in their first season under LVG though. With DDG, you can see his rooftop potential after first few months.

9744~~~
I like to think of him as a rich man's Jozy Altidore.

9745~~~
When is this deal permanent? I hope we can at least reduce the transfer fee.

9746~~~
He seemed capable enough to stand on his feet, never mind scoring those ridiculous goals. Why is he falling over all the time now?

9747~~~
Rather Chico than Radamel for me. He is younger, more mobile, more proven in EPL and is likely to decline less tremendously, while Falcao looks past his best, on mega bucks and is very unlikely to hit the form of his old best. In LvG I trust, but I am afraid that Chico will do better elsewhere than Radamel at United next season.

9748~~~
What are the odds we'll keep him..?

9749~~~
I think there's a chance if you can get the price down to £20m. If Monaco still want €43m, forget it. Plus a Falcao pay cut which I can't see happening.

9750~~~
Such a likeable guy it seems. Shame its not worked out. I'm hoping Real put a bid in for him. Do not want to see him lining up for one of our domestic rivals next year. Madrid move would probably favour all parties.

9751~~~
Monaco will probably want a full price I think.

9752~~~
Eh???? But that's not the point. The point you missed is most wrote those players off last season didn't they? We had the whole belittling of Fellaini in the media and by pundits, so who would have predicted their turnaround this season? Isn't Young's form keeping our 60m player on the bench?

DDG was longer than a few months......

9753~~~
Not trying to "defend" him here, but Falcao did no worse than Rooney who was on the back foot all game. 

Monaco is very eager to get him of his books, and after the season he has had, they would be mad to ask a price like that. Also (unless he is an idiot), he should be more than happy to take a paycut to play for us. 

Imagine if we get him for a bargain price and then "old Falcao" turns up next year <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

9754~~~
There is not a chance in hell Monaco would get full price and even they will know that, In fact i'm sure even the President has said on record he knows Falcao has struggled this year. There will definitely be room for negotiations one way or another.

9755~~~
I think those discussions are being had. We'll sign him for an undisclosed fee. The noises LVG is making suggests this and he don't give a feck whether we are paying him 250k a week, he wouldn't play him if he didn't think he was up to it. Fact.

9756~~~
LVG said sthing like he may have to talk with him just as he had a talk with Chicharito and Welbeck. Although he said he's fit to play too or something in those lines

9757~~~
But we are creating next to nothing even when we are winning and controlling games. Even against City we scored 4 but it wasnt chance after chance territory. All I'm saying is I would bet afew goals and Falcao would look completely different. For Arsenal for example he'd score a truck load.

9758~~~
Here's the fact though. Rooney is better than either player and we play 1 striker so that Fellaini (to a lesser extent Ander) can get into the areas he's best in

Whoever we get <b>IS</b> the sub. 

Even if Falcao got back to somewhere near his best, Rooney is the manager's favourite and we play better with 1 striker than with 2. So clearly the best solution is to have whoever is okay and will do their best from the subs bench. If thats Hernandez it saves us money too. If he's not happy with that role we can look elsewhere

9759~~~
You say that like he hasn't been missing chances. He's missed a lot of chances. And that's in the context of seriously underwhelming all round play.

I do think it's just about possible he turns things round but he's been <i>really</i> poor so far and that can't be blamed on anyone else.

9760~~~
Maybe this is just a plan by LVG, asking Falcao to play like shite to bring the price down between United and Monaco.

9761~~~
<i>If </i>we do sign him, will he be happy to take reduce wages and be the 3rd striking option? Because realistically that is what is going to happen. If it was a choice between him and Hernandez, I would be choosing Hernandez.

9762~~~
Right player wrong time perhaps. We have to work so hard to create an opening playing posession football. Watch Leicester, They create chances with about 3 direct passes every 5 mins. We pass the ball perhaps 50 times more for each chance created! During this time you need a player staying swtiched on up front doing pretty much nothing except anticpate a ball that very rarely comes.

9763~~~
Well there were rumours in the summer that we had actually bought him, but structured the first year as a loan only as a favour to Monaco for FFP reasons - IF that is the case, then...

9764~~~
So sensationalist. You'd do well at The Sun.

9765~~~
Agree that the PL ain't the league to come to after a serious injury but the point I'm trying to make is Young and Fellaini ain't never got to the level Falcao reached in there career but are doing well, where as Falcao we know what he can do and I think that he might be just having a crap season and on top adjusting to the PL and a new country is also playing a part!

I don't think we will see Falcao at his peak best again but if he can get to 50% of that I think he will still be banging in goals!

You have to remember RVN and Shearer had similar injuries and they adjusted there game and managed!!

9766~~~
man that video above is sooo depressing, he isn't a shadow of that. like he's learning to play again all over

9767~~~
You give me an option of Falcao or Hernandez to come off our bench next yr, and I'd take Hernandez

9768~~~
Of course that's my point. Those two improve under different manager. Unless you are expecting us to change manager next season.

Falcao would be worth it if he becomes twice the player he is now. Otherwise he'll just blocking the path of us potentially getting better striker that we need. With his age and progress so far, is he worth the gamble?

9769~~~
If Falcao was twice the player he was now he'd have eight goals.

That would still be less than Danny Ings, Nacer Chadli and former United flop Mame Biram Diouf.

Maybe if he was five times the player he is now he'd be an okay signing.

9770~~~
Goal tally is the output of other attributes, so the relation would be exponential instead of straight/direct.

9771~~~
We'll there are others that have gone backward under this manager too, it works both ways. Like I said and maybe it's me but, what ever happened to the season to come to terms with the new country, manager, team and league? When did we  stop giving players that opportunity? ADM better start looking elsewhere then?  Yep, I know there are examples of those who hit the ground running but it's the exception and not the rule....

9772~~~
But if he scores 3 goals out of no where ala Hernandez has done recently then everyone in here will be shouting how he deserves next season at the club...

9773~~~
If he was twice the player... he also be earning in excess of 500K a week

9774~~~
think Hernandez does not want to be here...and LvG does not want him either...I think it will be neither tbh.....we will go for two new strikers or at least one striker and an attacking midfielder.

9775~~~
I think we'd all be willing to keep an average Falcao, this Falcao i've seen play this season has definitely been worse than average... he has been shocking.

9776~~~
Monaco are the big losers here, we took a risk it hasn't worked and I am sure we have no intention of paying a third choice striker 250k a week, talk about the club not caring about his wages is nonsense. He is paid to be world class not a backup who cant even make an impact, no way going forward that will be allowed to continue, same applies to other players.

Falcao as well probably has no intention of staying because why would he want to sit on the bench and have to wait for injuries to get a game, if RVP was fit he may well have not even got his recent cameos. He is also guaranteed 250k a week for next few years so he's not giving that up no matter what, he moved to Monaco for money after all.

Monaco are faced with reality of either having to let him go for a small fee, maybe even for free, having to loan him again and there is a good chance they may have to subsidise his wages even when they do get rid of him.

9777~~~
Nothing I said there wasn't true.

Well RVP and Wilson have been injured, so we've been pretty limited on the striker front. 

LVG has only played him when he's had to, in the last few months.

9778~~~
Falcao hasn't had the best of a run in the team, nor has he always had teamates playing him in chances but what I've seen so far has not been worth all the hype let along the wages. What he did to Chelsea in the Super Cup he looks like a shot player in comparison. He could be one of those who takes a season to settle then explodes but doesn't look likely, needs to shoot more, get Paul Ince on the case!

9779~~~
I can categorically tell you he is capable of running without falling over.

9780~~~
The way he runs makes him look as if he's about to fall over if connecting with a slight breeze.

9781~~~
He's been fine for a while, quite good in his first few weeks, even if the finishing wasn't there. But he's turned from OK to a total disaster as time went by.

9782~~~
But that isn't the case is it. He will not get knocked over by a 'slight breeze'. Just an exaggeration, one of many people use to ridicule Falcao. Kind of like saying he can't...

.

He has done all of those things. In fact I saw a message in here talking about his pass %age when he came on V Everton and it was very high. Yes nothing particularly risky but not as bad as people constantly make out. 

He has not been good and I am not defending him against his wage or potential transfer fee. I will defend him against sensationalist ridicule and, often, lies.

9783~~~
I take your point, but there is some justice in saying he's knocked on the floor a great deal, also both his ball control and his overal strength when trying to hold up the ball, with his back to defenders has been found lacking to date.

9784~~~
I agree with that, yes. It's far away from the original post I quoted (which wasn't yours).

9785~~~
LVG still wouldn't have played him.....

9786~~~
Agreed, the price needs to drop down drastically from the alleged £40m, and he needs to take a significant pay-cut to accommodate our new signings. I hope LVG giving him chances is more of an indication in his faith that Falcao'll come good in awhile, rather than a last chances for Falcao to prove his worth. Because despite all, Falcao <i>was </i>a world-class finisher before being hit by a career-threatening injury that kept him sidelined for too long a stretch of time. Even this season, he wasn't given enough consecutive runs or starts for him to gain some confidence early on, and though he has been unlucky or poor at holding-up the ball or finishing, he's shown great desire and commitment every time he's played. 

He's Falcao, folks. One poor rehab season might be a deception. If Liverpool can take a 20m gamble with Balotelli, so can we with a tad more higher for Radamel Falcao. :P (Although I hope ours pays off instead).
Maybe we could at least extend the loan, to give him another chance next season when we'll have other competitions to play for.

9787~~~
With the resources we have though why bother gambling on him? Makes no sense even if he improves what are we going to realistically get from someone who is close to turning 30 and has had three serious knee injuries, 2 decnt seasons maybe. It could take him another six months to get himself back to even half the player he used to be I really don't see the point it's the kind of gamble you take only of you are desperate or it's not expensive.

Falcao isn't going to drop his wages so that's 12m a year on a four year deal plus his signing on fee that's over 50m quid and that's without a transfer fee, if ant see anyone signing off that deal.

9788~~~
Manchester United is not some rehab club or an old peoples' home.
Only the best players are allowed to ply their trade for this club.

Scoring 4 goals in a half a season is terrible whichever way you look at it.
In comparison, Costa, who has also been injured regularly and had a stop start season has scored more than 4 times as many goals.

The right thing for him to do is to move to an easier league and lesser club, where he can get a guaranteed starting place (by virtue of his name, not his skill) and then attempt to regain his form.
At Man Utd, scoring 4 goals per season is going to turn us and him into a laughing stock and will cost us the league title.

Furthermore LVG has stated that he is looking for a 20 goal/season striker and that clearly is not Falcao.
IMO, Falcao should be paying Manchester United for allowing him to play for us and carry out his rehabilitation.

<b>What logical reason is there for continuing to give him chances? Genuine question.</b>

9789~~~
The wages part is too discouraging, yes. Without a wage cut, the deal is impossible. 

As to why we should take a gamble, just read up the first 10-15 pages of this thread. We were over the moon when he signed for us, when he was just back from his ACL. Our valuation of him has taken a pummelling on the basis of only this season's performance, and there's every reason to believe that this was an exception rather than a rule. It's not as if there are plenty of strikers available in the market out there, either who'll be willing to sit on the bench and play second fiddle to Rooney and yet provide the same quality of output. So though we could go for a Lacazette or a Kane as a long term replacement, it wouldn't be bad <b>if</b> Falcao improved dramatically to is usual levels next year off a good pre-season, and provided us for a couple of years' worth service at the top level before we sign a better long term replacement. It's a big if, but that's my point - the gamble is not a bad choice.

9790~~~
He didn't. He said we didn't have one, and he's correct on that since none of our strikers have scored 20+ goals this season. It's still possible we go into next season with Rooney, RvP and Wilson. He said nothing whatsoever about bringing in a new striker.

For the reason to play Falcao: he's earning alot of money and is a Manchester United player. Rooney was needed elsewhere and RvP/Wilson weren't fit to play. Van Gaal <i>always</i> plays with a real striker as he's not a fan of playing Di Maria/Januzaj/Mata or anyone like that as striker, he doesn't even like Messi as striker. If you've got Falcao and you're paying him huge wages you play him when it's needed if he's the only option. This will at least keep him focussed and not turn into a bad influence in the dressing room. We might need him if RvP gets injured again in training and Rooney is out. He might even be doing well in training? As long as he's ours, I don't see a problem with playing him. He's not a guaranteed starter anyways.

I don't want him at the club next season, mind.

9791~~~
Why is there every reason to believe it is an exception? If no injury was involved I might see the logic but fact is he suffered a career threatening injury over a year ago and still hasn't recover, he was rushed back from that injury and he has had serious knee injuries before. The most likely outcome is he won't get back to his best, he is essentially an expensive long shot and should only interest clubs who are desperate or have more money than sense.

I also don't think falcao will be happy to be backup to Rooney, even less so than the likes of lacazette, dybala or benteke and as Rooney ages and declines so will falcao. Personally I just don't see the logic or need to gamble on him.

9792~~~
He's likely genuinely good in training, which LvG places a ton of emphasis on and continues to stress that his selections are based completely on meritocracy. Whenever he's spoken of Falcao he keeps suggesting that he is showing quality but its frustrating to not see it happening for him in matches.

9793~~~
Get him some creative midfielders next season then we will see a return of form. Then everyone will sing his praises and forget how much they use to criticise him. Its the way of the world. Form is temporary and circumstantial while class is permanent.

9794~~~
It's become very annoying how poorly he handles the physical stuff. Falls over most of the time he receives the ball and if we don't get the foul call, we've usually lost the ball. All very surprising too since given his size and history

9795~~~
This season is pretty much done and dusted on our part, so i really don't care whether he plays or not. The interesting part is what is going to happen in the summer. I think we all agree that the prerequisite for him staying is Monaco giving him to us cheap, and he taking a substantial pay cut.

In the past we have had the likes of Owen and Henrik Larson in our squad, strikers who clearly were past their prime. If the above mentioned conditions are met, then i genuinely think we should take our chances on him. I highly doubt he will ever reach his old peak, but even if he went back to being 50% of that player, he would be a valuable addition.

9796~~~
There is every reason to believe that this guy is never going to play at a top level ever again.

9797~~~
Van Gaal must believe he still has top level in him so Falcao must show something in training. Otherwise he wouldn´t play instead of Wilson and Van Persie.

9798~~~
I think I've solved the mystery of Falcao's performance issues. There's a guy who looks remarkably like him selling fruit out of the back of a truck at the end of my street. He's clearly the real Falcao, who has swapped places with this fruit seller that now plays for Manchester United.

9799~~~
I read on twitter that the real Falcao died in the Summer, and was replaced by his twin brother <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I laughed at the time <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

9800~~~
If Monaco would sell for 10 million and he lower his wages to around 100k I would keep him but there's zero chance that would happen so he should leave.

9801~~~
100k for a player that literally can't run?

9802~~~
Persie was injured, Wilson still is.

9803~~~
He's better off going however cheap we could get him, it's sad to see him struggling so much and it'd be soul destroying for him, and us having him struggling away for another season.

He can go and play somewhere like Valencia, and RvP can take our 'not as good as he was' striker role next season.

9804~~~
One of those reasons isnt even true and the other is absolutely <i>not</i> a reason to play a player.

Seriously, playing players based on how much they earn? Wow...

9805~~~
I read a similar conspiracy theory but not that he died. That his twin brother (who I think is a lower league footballer) swapped places with him as Falcao's injury was too bad!!

9806~~~
The Walrus was Radamel.

9807~~~
same pace

9808~~~
He'll score a hattrick today and once he's scoring goals, he'll continue to score them ! He's the best striker in the league !

9809~~~
Its the hope that kills.

9810~~~
Hopefully he isnt on the bench today.

9811~~~
He should at least be on the bench. We are after all paying him a massive wage.

9812~~~
Anyone else laugh at the man bun? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9813~~~
Really? I thought it looks sexy <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

9814~~~
How about we start with 1 goal. Just 1. 
After he has scored 1 goal, we can start contemplating the miracle that will be 2 goals.
And if that miracle occurs, we can think about hell freezing over...cuz that's more likely than Falcao scoring 3 goals in a game.

9815~~~
Next game mate, he'll come in and score the winner and will go on from there for the rest of the season. a.k.a. 2 more games

9816~~~
He will probably score against Hull and because of that we will pay 30m for him, lol.

9817~~~
I would love to see him here next season and have a gut feeling we will.

9818~~~
Can I ask why you want more of what he has given us this season?

9819~~~
Hahahaha surely trolling. Why the hell would any United fan want him here next year.

9820~~~
Surely you're taking the piss but in case you're not...

Why? He's been sub par to put it midly in all but a handful of games this season and there's no sign he's improving. Falcao would cost a considerable amount to purchase in fee and wages and would have very little re-sale value if he was a flop again. The money would be better spent on a younger striker or in the defence which clearly needs strengthening if we are to challenge for the title next season.

9821~~~
I hope these are the last few weeks I have to set eyes on the useless sack of shit in a United shirt.

9822~~~
ahahahaha.

9823~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> blunt!

9824~~~
But fair. Him playing up front for United is like Paul Walker being cast in a remake of the Godfather. After his death.

9825~~~
I don't disagree, I just found it amusing.

9826~~~
Yes. And then the next. And the next. Keep on believing. One day he will score a goal.

I sniggered.

I laughed.

I laughed harder.

This made me laugh so hard, my stomach hurt.

I must say, the Falcao thread has provided me with many laughs. The belief that some fans have in this guy is amazing, but also delusional.
Even more funnier is the excuses that fans come up with, on Falcao's behalf.
The only other belief which compares is when Elvis died, yet his fans kept believing that he was/is still alive.

9827~~~
Agree. I have nothing against the guy (except being a <i>little</i> bitter about anyone who can get paid £250k/w for sod all), he seems very professional and he gives it his all, but he simply doesnt have "it" any more. All season people have been saying "next game" - it reminds me of Liverpool's "next year is our year" malarkey. We should have cut our losses a long time ago, I have found LVGs insistence on continuing to play him rather odd.

9828~~~
and the season's over.

9829~~~
It sums up his self-confidence at the moment. He needs to bring back his alice band if he wants to score again.

9830~~~
Elvis is dead?

9831~~~
Alice mushrooms are what he needs. Anything to change the reality of the current Falcao.

9832~~~
It's easy to have a short memory and forget exactly how good Falcao can be.

Maybe okay, he has lost it. It happens. Shevchenko and Torres are two strikers who seemed to go from pure class to pure rubbish overnight.

But if there's even just a 10% chance that Falcao can return to somewhere near his best (maybe he's needed a year to fully recover, and needs a Summer break after rushing back) I would love to keep him here for the next 6 months at least to find out. I'd be worried if he went to a rival that he would start to show his best. I would rather give him until to end of the calendar year here to prove himself. And I think that's what United will do.

9833~~~
Will you raise the money ?

9834~~~
I can't believe he's scored 4 goals. I only remember 2 of them. Everton and Villa.

9835~~~
Why do you care about his wages? Do you know United's accounts down the the penny? Just maybe we can easily afford them whilst continuing to sign our targets?

9836~~~
Some big decisions need to be made cause you could argue that both RVP and Falcao might not be here. I love them both but I have to now admit, this I'd based on history and not the present. If this is the case, going to be an expensive summer.....

9837~~~
Yes,why don't we give an ageing striker (who has been a complete disaster for us this season) £265k a week and sign him for 6 months(which would cost us a lot), because there is a 10% chance he might do well next season and go to our rivals (who aren't interested in him) and become a WC player again.

Then we recall Cleverley,reinstate Evans, resign Anderson and Roy Carroll (to replace De Gea) as those players might also succeed next season...because,10% chance.

9838~~~
We would have to sign him, it would be a very expensive deal for somebody who is clearly beyond return. We would be absolute fools to sign him permanently. Even if he went to arsenal and scored 10 goals next season it still wouldn't be enough for his wages/transfer fee. 

Yes he WAS an amazing player but he isn't the same anymore, so why sign him just because he is nice?

Because when at his best Falcao is the best striker on the planet. Cleverley, Evans etc aren't even the best in their street.

If Falcao recovers his swagger after the Summer, it's a massive win. If he doesn't you say ta-rah in January. There's a price to pay sure, but that's up to United and if they think it's worth it.

9840~~~
I'm not talking about signing him. I'm talking about extending the loan until the end of the calendar year to see how he performs after the Summer. If it doesn't work out then we can say goodbye in January.

9841~~~
1.) Falcao is not going to "recover his swagger" after the summer.
2.) We are contending for 4 trophies next season, we don't have time to babysit a has-been.
3.) This 6 month fairytale would cost us a lot of money we could use to sign better players in the summer.
4.) If the experiment flops we won't be able to say "ta-rah in January" as no team would be foolish enough to pay for his services.
5.) This is not Manager Mode in FIFA.

9842~~~
1) That's your opinion which I respect. And maybe you are correct. I just wouldn't be as sure.
2) I don't expect him to be first choice, he hasn't earned that yet. But would be a good player to have around in my opinion.
3) If you know United's accounts then fair play. Otherwise it's best to let United decide what they can and cannot do.
4) The loan would end and he would go back to Monaco presumably. You could maybe get a 6 month extension with the option of another 6 months if he does indeed do well.
5) I don't quite understand what you mean. I assume you mean that the likelihood of us loaning Falcao for an extra 6 months in unrealistic. Which again, fair enough that's your opinion. I'd just say watch this space.

9843~~~
And why would Monaco want to do that? Just a silly idea IMO. Why potentially miss out on a younger, better player just to see if a miraculous recovery might happen. If he isn't back to normal after 7/8 months no way is he going to turn a corner after the summer.

9844~~~
Monaco would probably like him off the payroll for a further 6 months.

You may be correct, maybe he won't. I'm not saying he will definitely be the normal Falcao again after a Summer break, but I would take the risk myself.

9845~~~
I think we could've afforded to have given him more of a chance if he was 26 or 27, but now sadly his chances of recovery to anything close to his best are dwindling with every game he plays and fails to score - and fast.

9846~~~
The sight of him in a United shirt actually makes me sad. Was such a fantastic player, now he looks like a dying bee out on the pitch. Sooner the better himself and the club part ways, it's been a disaster.

9847~~~
Sometimes a player has a bad injury or injuries and they are not the same player again - same with Torres who was also one of the best strikers in the world at his peak.

9848~~~
<a class="username" data-user="66142, @LawCharltonBest" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/66142/">@LawCharltonBest</a> 

My problem is, he's shown no signs of getting close to that player again- if anything he looked better around September/October. Even if he does recover some form, I don't think he'll ever be the same player because physically he just doesn't look right and that's exacerbated by playing in a physical league like the Premier League verses La Liga or Serie A. Even to just extend his loan rather than buying him, it's not worth it.

9849~~~
We would become the laughing stock of football if we went out and spent 30 million to buy him then paid him 300k a week, he will never return to the Falcao of old that's plain to see.

If he finished the season with some goals then itd be worth considering but it's no exaggeration when I say he looks like a pub player.

9850~~~
That is very possible. I would not throw all my chips at the Falcao bandwagon. And I cited Shevchenko and Torres as examples of World Class strikers who never recovered.

However, I would definitely keep him until the end of 2015 to see how he does fare after the Summer break. Maybe he needed a year to recover, maybe he needs a small operation in the Summer on his knee that will help. I think the risk is worth it purely for how good he was pre-injury. If there's a chance he can regain that for a year or two, everyone will again want him to stay at United. Things can quickly change in football. If he scores 2 goals, suddenly he becomes a hero again.

My prediction is that we will extend the loan 6 months. But we shall see.

9851~~~
Like I said before, I would not endorse signing him. Just extending the loan until January. If the only way to keep him is to sign him for those sums then yes I agree with all of you and we shouldn't touch it.

9852~~~
Don't think Monaco will play ball with another loan though, they'll want a sale so other teams will probably be in for him, I've heard juve linked quite a lot.

9853~~~
I think Monaco would be willing to loan again, it gets him off the payroll. Of course if a team comes in with a good price trying to sign him, Monaco will want that. But it's probably Jorge Mendes with the strings. And Juve would not pay the wages that United would.

9854~~~
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline">Monaco have revealed Manchester United have told them they have not ruled out keeping Radamel Falcao next season.</span></b>

Monaco say they held a meeting with Manchester United last week where they said no decision had been made on Radamel Falcao.

United have the option to turn Falcao's one-year loan deal into a £43.2m permanent transfer in the summer.

The Colombian striker has scored four goals in 27 appearances this season and has been widely tipped to leave Old Trafford.

But Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev says United have told the French club they haven't yet made a decision about whether or not to keep the 29-year-old.

Vasilyev told L'Equipe: “I met the Manchester officials last Sunday. They have not decided if they would exercise the option.

“It has not been his best season, but they will decide at the season.

“The decision lies with Manchester and then we will discuss with the player to know what he wants.”

Must be the same officials that went to Spain to sign Herrera under Moyes.

9856~~~
obscene.

From Manchester Evening News...
<span style="font-size: 22px">
<b>De Gea contract could include Falcao stay </b></span>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-transfer-news-de-9189681" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...ws/manchester-united-transfer-news-de-9189681</a>

Surely nonsense. Would be laughable for the club to get played like that by Falcao and his agent.

9858~~~
Second article I've seen saying that. Freaking ludicrous if so.

9859~~~
Would rather De Gea leaving if that's the case, but i also think it's just speculation.

9860~~~
Held to ransom if so. A big no thanks to this "offer".

9861~~~
Naa. We're never going to tell them we're not keeping him before the last game of the season is played. We still have him for three more games.

9862~~~
That's just someone belatedly putting two and two together.

9863~~~
We need to stop dealing with Mendes.

9864~~~
That is NONSENSE.

9865~~~
So basically it would be that we would take the junk no one wants because he's finished for 40m and then DDG will sign? Id say we show the door to both and never deal with Mendez again.

9866~~~
Agree 100%, i had a feeling this may happen a few weeks ago and if we are being strong armed by Mendes into signing Falcao then Woody and the United board need to tell to fck off.

The other angle is that Mendes is a close friend/acquaintance of Fergie and maybe Woody doesn't want to cause any conflict between the them.

9867~~~
You dont spend 40m on junk because you dont want Fergie to lose his mate. I think it was SAF who once said that no one is bigger than the club.

9868~~~
So does Falcao. Unless he no longer wants to play football.

9869~~~
I don't understand why we would pay a striker £200k a week, who we would probably looked to ship out, to keep a GK who will also be on £200k a week.

We would effectively be paying £400k a week to keep De Gea and this is without taking into consideration a loan / transfer fee for Falcao.

I would love De Gea to stay, but jeez...

9870~~~
Mendes is such a good agent <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9871~~~
Assuming there's a huge lack of interest in Falcao, Mendes would be daft not to create links between de Gea's situation and Falcao's situation.

9872~~~
Worth it.

9873~~~
It would be compensated if we ditched Rooney - Rvp.

9874~~~
Mental if true (which I'm 99% sure it isn't).

9875~~~
Nah that's nonsense... I'm not letting it ruin my "we only have 3 more games with him" street party.

9876~~~
“If I’d brought Radamel Falcao, we might as well make Jorge Mendes president of Real Madrid!” - Perez last year.

Definitely seems plausible then that Mendes would use his clients in such ways. That, plus Andy Mitten's recent piece saying that 'goodwill to one player could carry over to another with the same agent' sounds somewhat ominous. Obviously you never know what Mitten knows and what he's guessing, but he definitely has his sources inside the club.

Hopefully, Falcao will decide to go elsewhere for his own good too, but an offer from us could do him some good in negotiations with other clubs.

9877~~~
There's been some bad business done in the last few years by our club, but signing Falcao to a permanent deal for £42 million would really take the cake. Or is it the biscuit? Pfft it would be that ludicrous it would take the cake and the biscuit.

9878~~~
Errr no its not!

9879~~~
We're definitely signing him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9880~~~
This would be the worst deal we've ever made, we'd essentially be re-buying a keeper we already own for £40M as Falcao is as much use as a bikini shop in Afghanistan.

9881~~~
I'll seriously question the way this club is being run if we sign this man on a permanent deal. Imagine this happening under SAF. It simply wouldn't.

9882~~~
Why would he even want to stay? He will hardly even get any minutes next season.

Getting played like fools by a football agent will not look good on the image of this club, even Real Madrid seem to have had enough of that clown Mendes, I'm sure if enough clubs boycott him he will fade into nothingness and all his clients will leave him too. We should actually try reverse threats for a change.

9883~~~
I'm not sure he's even worth signing to keep de Gea.

I'd be mightily unimpressed should we sign him and it'll be a big negative hanging over van Gaal's and Woodward's head.

9884~~~
I dont believe anything regarding Mendes forcing Falcao onto us, as part of De Gea deal.
At the end of the day De Gea makes his own decisions, while taking advice from his agent.
If his agent tells him, "stay at Man Utd because Falcao is staying as part of the deal" De Gea wont give a damn.
Mendes does not own or employ De Gea. In fact, its the other way around. 
If De Gea was a teenager, then Mendes manipulation would be a worry. But at De Gea's age - he'll decide whats right for him.

Furthermore, to even suggest that Man Utd would be held ransom to Mendes' demands (regarding Falcao and De Gea) is ridiculous.
If Ed Woodward calls up LVG and says, "Louis, we are trying to negotiate a deal for De Gea, but Mendes is insisting that we Falcao or De Gea is gone, what do you think we should do?"
LVG will call Mendes and probably give him the hair dryer treatment.

Some of you are not aware of the temper LVG has on him and how strong-willed he is. He will absolutely not be told which player to buy/sell/play. 
If Falcao stays its because LVG has told E.Woodward that he wants him to stay.

Whichever way I look at it, Man Utd wont fall for this (forced) Falcao-De Gea (dual) deal.

9885~~~
We've already given Mendes enough for the Bebe debacle. 

He can do one if there's any truth in it

9886~~~
If he is here next season, there will be some serious questions that require answering.
His wages alone make it a complete joke

9887~~~
Is that even legal? Holding us to ransom on De Gea's contract because his other client is shite and saying if we want one, we have to stump up 40m for the other?

9888~~~
Can we not just give Mendes 5 million pounds or something? 2 Bebes would be much cheaper than this.

Falcao should just go to Valencia, Wolfsburg or Milan or something. He'll play better than he has here (another year after the injury) and end up with decent but not outstanding goalscoring numbers and everyone's happy.

9889~~~
Mendes is very good friends with Woodward. He'll probably be open to a deal like this to keep a supply line to big talents open.

9890~~~
fine, we can sign him to keep mendes happy but that shouldn't mean falcao should be allowed anywhere near the first team.

9891~~~
Our team is brimful of world-class talent that Mendes has gotten for us.

Where would we be without him? We might be struggling for 4th place having spent quarter of a billion pounds in two years!

9892~~~
I would take Falcao for another season-long loan deal.

9893~~~
Our cup truly runneth over. I mean, he managed to convince Madrid to sell us Di Maria for £60m, despite the fact they'd been punting him around Europe for £15m less only weeks earlier. And what better way to test our fancy new medical devices than bringing in a world class striker who hasn't yet recovered from a cruciate injury. £300k p/w would be cheap at twice the price.

9894~~~
I would honestly keep him to for 1 more loan season as long as we sign a goal scoring wide forward. LVG is not dropping Rooney so getting a starting world class striker is pointless right now i would rather keep Falcao on massively reduced wages.

9895~~~
Ridiculous if true. Fergie would show the door to Both De Gea and Falcao whilst kicking Mendez'ass . 
We are not a charity house.

9896~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/manchester-united-keep-radamel-falcao-5640811" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Mirror</a>

9897~~~
If Falcao is still a United player next season then we deserve to fail. That would be a shocking decision.

9898~~~
Don't see any harm in extending the loan deal.

9899~~~
Forlan went 30 games without a goal at the start of his United career then got about 10 in his second season, some important ones as well. If Falcao gets a preseason with us and the expectations aren't as high (and the team is playing better) he could have a better season for us.

9900~~~
Extending his loan deal wouldnt be that bad. I would like to see him with a proper pre season and after the shock of the 1st year.

9901~~~
There;s part of me that would be ok with extending the deal. I can't shake a nagging suspicion that he'll suddenly looks shit hot again. ACL reconstructions can really mess you round but it's still possible to progress, physically, a year or more after the original operation. When you look at the difference in Vidal, over the course of this season, it's hard not to wonder if a summer playing a lot of football in the Copa will bring Falcao up a level. If he's still gash by next winter then get rid but it would be a pain in the hole if we let him go and he gets back to his  best somewhere else. This season's CL has been bad enough for watchig ex-United players have starring roles, I could <i>really</i> do without Falcao doing the same.

9902~~~
but at £350k a week plus probably another £100k-200k a week in loan fee my expectations would still be very very high and he has shown no signs of being able to deliver anything like value on that kind of investment - Id much rather get him off the wage bill and get a younger striker in who can have that pre season with us and be an option off the bench when needed.- Similarly if we are going to pay £350k a week to anybody I'm expecting Aguero, Suarez hell even Messi type performances

9903~~~
For some reason I would actually be Quite happy with this

9904~~~
Extending the deal is stupid. He isn't going to miraculously get better. And even if he does, he will have to be playing consistent first team football which we can't offer unless we want RvP/Rooney in midfield, most likely alongside Fellaini which will mean absolutely no creativity and tempo in the midfield and directly causing no change in Falcao's play.

9905~~~
Yeah we owe Mendes a great deal. Without him we might never have:

1. Sold our best player to Madrid (which we might do again this summer).
2. Paid £16m to help Monaco get a washed up forward off their wage bill (which we might continue to do next season).
3. Paid £7m for Bebe.
4. Paid £20m for Anderson. Plus, somehow, contract extensions, so we paid him wages for eight years.
5. Somehow got Nani a new five year contract. With the result that we are now paying him to play for another team.
6. £60m + massive wages on Di Maria. Because of one amazing season.
7. Monaco don't want Valdes on a free? United can pay him.

Just have to hope this guy keeps on helping us out like this. He's one of the good guys, not like Pogba's agent who got his player a move from our reserves to the Juventus first team, the rogue.

9906~~~
The ship sailed months ago. We need to just let him go. I can actually see a situation where De Gea leaves but Falcao stays <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

9907~~~
The same Fergie that bought Bebe for 12.5million as a favor to Mendes?

9908~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9909~~~
That is quite frankly ridiculous.

9910~~~
I wouldn't mind an extension either. The payoff if he comes good would obviously be huge. Although we won't be able to bed in a new younger faster striker in to eventually replace Rooney.

9911~~~
Signing him for another season would be utter madness, just mental. Even if he got back to say 75% of his best, what next? Buy him next Summer at the age of 30/31 for huge money? No thanks.

There are plenty of strikers out there that are a) better b) have more potential c) far more cost effective. The sooner he is gone the better.

9912~~~
I wouldn't be against extending the loan.  I personally believe he will return to form next season.  It usually takes a full year to recover from a torn ACL. Him trying to rush through his rehab for the WC certainly didn't help either.  I don't see the harm, because if he goes to another club and starts playing well again, we will regret it and think what could've been.

9913~~~
This, basically. Mendes can feck right off and take Falcao with him.

9914~~~

9915~~~
For those of you who believe that he will suddenly become great next season - can you explain your reasoning/logic behind this?
I'm struggling to understand how any sane person who knows anything about football, would want to have him at their club?

A friend of mine who live in Portugal and supports Benfica were discussing Falcao. I joked that he should maybe join Benfica. He was terrified at this thought as he too believes this guy is terrible.

9916~~~
Sunama there is logic there. You just need to try a little harder <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> A Pre season is really important. You have to know that. He came into a team that was struggling and he loses confidence. Maybe in himself? But certainly in the fact that we would sign him. We then find a way of playing which means he can only really replace Rooney. Basically he could still come good and that's hard for people to imagine, but look how many people believe in Santa and the tooth fairy. Have a little imagination for feck sake ..

Of course he could still come good. We need quicker play, better service to the strikers. More imagination and belief and a Pre Season to build up fitness.

9917~~~
why? we'd literally be 10th if it wasn't for de gea. we should fight hard for him if he's worth 15+ points

9918~~~
The elephant in the room is where does Rooney play if Falcao stays?

Van Gaal has publicly stated himself that he won't drop Rooney, and Falcao can't play anywhere else other than CF (where, this season, he can barely play anyway) so the options are...

1. Rooney plays up top - meaning you're basically paying Falcao £250,000 a week to sit on the bench - fecked wage structure, stops young talent coming through, would obviously just be a deal to appease Mendes.

2. Falcao plays up top - meaning Rooney (a better striker) plays in midfield which is rapidly becoming a laughable sight and a points gift to other teams. This also means a better midfielder sitting on the bench.

3. Strip Rooney of the captaincy a season after he's sacrificed his position for the manager, give it to someone else and rotate him and Falcao - this will probably cause massive discontent within the dressing room and (I imagine) divides within the squad.

The best of those 3 options is number 3, which says a lot.

As many of you know, I don't like the Falcao transfer - I don't like seeing us give this guy game time, I don't like him being paid half a million quid every fortnight, I don't like Mendes, I don't like how Falcao is trumped as a 'loves the club' 'great guy' when he's been proven to be a 1st class mercenary who'll sacrifice his later career for big money moves and most of all, I don't like what he's given us on the pitch - basically nothing.

These are just my opinions. I've been accused of being an 'agenda poster' by <a class="username" data-user="34496, @Brwned" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34496/">@Brwned</a> and others, but if you look back at my first posts in this thread when he'd first signed I was really excited and my opinion has gradually changed and been formed over the season...




You can see I've not had 'an agenda' against Falcao - I've just got an opinion that this is easily the worst loan business I've ever seen United involved in (the last 30 years), and to continue it would be absolutely farcical.

I really feel we need to toughen up and become more ruthless regarding the contracts we award, the standard we accept at this great club, and our dealings with agents - particularly with Mendes, a man who's milked this club over the last 10 years and given very little back.

I'm gonna try not to post so much in this thread because everything about the deal annoys me, and I'm aware that my attitude toward Falcao and Mendes annoys other people!

If he stays, I think it's ridiculous. I also hope if he stays I'm proven wrong about this footballer and the deal itself.

9919~~~
I don't know why but i just have this feeling we are going to keep him. I think the bad season he has had and the fact that it SEEMS barely any other club is interested in h8im, means we hold all the cards with him and Monaco know this.
I'm not sure exactly why we would keep him (unless we know we will be able to get him for a lot less which we probably will be able to) but we don't know what goes on in training, he may be a different player in training and his form could all be down to a complete lack of confidence.
It would explain why we may be still interested in him as Van Gaal may think that if he get his confidence back, he could get close to his best.
I mean thats pure speculation obviously but like i said, we don't see what goes on in training. One thing is certain though imo, Depay can cross a ball, he also does his fair share of through balls so Falcao would probably be getting more goal scoring chances you would of thought.

9920~~~
I wouldn't care if we had him next season for free.  The logic that some people are using is that because other players have recovered from his kind of injury after a season or two, he will automatically do that and become something like he was in the past.  When there is no evidence that he can/will do that in the PL and there is not slightest sign of him ever being that kind of player again.

You can be pretty sure that RVP will be here next season, which means we have the prospect of two crocked strikers on our roster who can play heavy minutes with low return.  Also, do we want to see Rooney for half the season in midfield again, after what we've already put up?  No, this won't do.  Please send him back.

9921~~~
I can't say I disagree with any of that.

9922~~~
You do have quite a lot of posts invested into this thread for someone who clearly doesn't like Falcao (more than 1/10th of all your posts in Redcafe atm) so no wonder people think you have an agenda.

but I have to say I share your sentiments, was excited at first but it just seems like there's no light at the end of the tunnel and it'd be waste of our resources to keep him for another season.

9923~~~
He'll score a brace tomorrow.

9924~~~
What's the point in extending the loan, then we'd be stuck with him and RvP, two has-beens, one is surely enough.

9925~~~
is this a new saying that going round as a joke? or do you actually mean that? i've seen it written several times over the past few weeks and i'm wondering if i'm missing something here.

9926~~~
We create feck all every week, Falcao is tbe best number 9 in the whole world, after 3 losses the team will kick it up a notch and we'll create lots of chances because of the increased tempo and urgency. And then Falcao will thrive, if you give him a chance, he scores. Once he bags one in and regains some confidence, believe me, he'll score another at least.

9927~~~
Falcao really isnt the best nr. 9 in the world..its not about the chances,its about his whole game nowadays.

9928~~~
That's some fantasy you've created <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he's been absolutely hopeless....best number 9 in the world?!

9929~~~
Got ya !

9930~~~
... is there white text somewhere?

9931~~~
he's clearly taking the piss... have a look at his other posts in this thread

9932~~~
Got ya !

9933~~~
DOn't tell me the media in the NL shares this with you...

9934~~~
Kidding xd, it resembles some of the posts earlier this season here.

9935~~~
Another loan wouldn't be the worst option. Not ideal but even if he leaves who are we going to buy anyway if Rooney/RvP are here and especially Rooney has to start all games? Anyone who could do a good job will be too good to sit on the bench. Even someone younger like Dybala is just too good to play 2nd fiddle behind Rooney. And Dybala needs to play regularly if he is going to be as good as his potential suggests therefore I think he will join an Italian club and not a PL top club with already established striker(s).

Maybe with M7 adding some goals and Falcao hopefully improving (surely he can't get any worse?) it will be enough. Plus Falcao will also play in the Copa America which might not be bad as he needs competitive games.

9936~~~
Got to admire the optimism here, the triumph of hope over experience.

9937~~~
one last chance to impress then...

9938~~~
So what's the reason behind Falcao being made the scapegoat this week?

9939~~~
He should have taken it from Smalling, skinned the entire Palace team and cracked it in off the bar Yeboah style. But the useless lump can't even manage that.

9940~~~
Good nuisance work in creating space for Fellaini at the back post.

9941~~~
This is where I feel bad for him. Young had the chance to square it to him, his positioning is perfect and he would have had a tap in. Instead Young pulled it back to Mata who skied it. Falcao has done nothing wrong today.

9942~~~
Not really done anything, but neither did Rooney to be honest.

9943~~~
That should/would have been a goal of Young had passed to him yes.

9944~~~
And that's what it boils down to. No one is saying that Falcao has been anything close to good but he doesn't do anything an off form Rooney doesn't do.

Just as I say that, two pieces of brilliant work from Falcao. Herrera and Young both should've done better.

9945~~~
Been better than Rooney, cant really complain as he hasnt done much wrong.

9946~~~
Chipped pass for Herreras chance was nice.

9947~~~
Decent today. Could've had a couple of Young had picked him out. Unlucky that Young then Herrera missed from being played in by him too.

9948~~~
Was nice indeed, but I was quite baffled with the space he had he didn't go for goal, shows where his confidence is though I guess

9949~~~
I think sometimes we forgot Falcao and Di Maria were one of the best players in the world in their respective positions a season ago. Puts in to perspective how bad they have been at this club.

9950~~~
Why he still takes the pitch for us is a mystery, I'd rather have Wilson running about.

9951~~~
Slight improvement from him this week, when he finally got involved he made a decent pass or two

9952~~~
Nothing to lambast him for in that performance. Might as well just bump this thread every week automatically though cos there's clearly not enough ways to shit on him ad infinitum.

9953~~~
Thought he was better than Rooney today. Saw far less of the ball (not his fault) but did well. Played a big part in Fellaini's goal, and was involved in one of our best bits of play at the end (Herrera shot)

9954~~~
He did nothing wrong, but nothing special either. He is bit unlucky that we moved deeper in the second half, but he still had the same number of touches as Rooney with better passing accuracy than Wayne. Pretty much same halves from both, both were far from great.

9955~~~
Thought he played quite well. That one two with Hererra was kind of cool.

9956~~~
Good cameo I thought. Shame about him. What could have been.

9957~~~
No surprise given the crap service both receive. What more can they do?

9958~~~
Rooney was shite from the moment he picked up that knock. Falcao had a better game. Neither of them were given a single decent chance to score though. Story of our season.

9959~~~
He didn't really have a chance to do much, but I feel that's mostly down to Young, who's crossing wasn't great. Could've had a couple of decent attempts had Young found him. What little he did do he did well enough. Created a great chance for Herrera.

9960~~~
Bleh clutching at straws really can't believe how disappointing he's been. Yes he didn't get many chances but he didn't bust a gut to make himself one either. Just not good enough. 3 strikers taking home the best part of a million a week and can barely remember the last time one of them scored.

9961~~~
Invisibly dominated! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Actually in fairness he grew into the game, had one decent lay off and created 2 decent chances, can't see any reason for people to criticism him today.

9962~~~
I thought he was much better than usual. If we didn't feck up so badly in the last 3 games I'd like to see him get some starts up front with a proper midfield behind him (would mean Rooney getting dropped, which won't happen).

9963~~~
He wasn't completely useless today. And affected Speroni's positioning for the second goal.

That's value for money.

9964~~~
Shame Young didn't pass to him, he'd made a good run.

9965~~~
Played alright today, he was probably at the level Rooney is on a bad day. To be fair to him, he hasn't sulked and seems prepared to work, unlike RvP under Moyes.

9966~~~
He's bit pointless.

Which would be fine if he was scoring goals as a out and out striker but he doesn't look like scoring in the slightest right now.


Rather would have thrown in Wilson probably, whose pace would have been a outlet.

9967~~~
He actually saw a lot of the ball towards the end and was putting in runs. I'm happy that he will dodge the hate, for a few days anyway.

9968~~~
I don't think Rooney was shite, but he did nothing special before the injury too. Van Persie was much better in the last game without any service either.

Well van Persie didn't have any service in the last game either and yet he was our most dangerous player.

9969~~~
Players seem to think twice before playing the ball into his feet.

That's not a good sign.

9970~~~
He wasn't poor today. The problem was our midfield and defence and their complete inability to retain possession. Falcao was never going to shine in a game like that.

Got in the way of the Palace defenders for our second goal and created a chance for Herrera. Exceeded (the admittedly low) expectations.

9971~~~
People keep saying this about Wilson. Remember, he has hardly covered himself in glory either when he has played. It's the ol caf 'when they don't play the reputation increases' with Wilson. Still not convinced he will even make it here in all honesty.

9972~~~
Some of the comments in here. 

I thought he was very good today. Didn't get played in for some superb runs - Ashley Young's pull back to Mata in particular. Was sharp and lively, showed strength and great movement.

Completed 12 of 13 passes - 92.3%
Recovered the ball - 1
Aerial duels - 1 of 2
Take ons - 1
Clearances - 1
Headed clearances - 1
Foul suffered - 1

Would have loved to have seen him offered the same volley chance Rooney claimed a penalty for or the ghost header Rooney missed. Note I'm not criticising Rooney here, just on this form, Falcao looked sharp and I'd have liked to have seen what he could have done in similar situations in that 2nd half.

9973~~~
can't decide if we ever had a bigger star player flop, he's awfull why don't we rather play in ten man ffs?

9974~~~
I actually believe in that in the past few games, he hasnt been bad.
However, we do not want a player who is "not bad". We are looking for a striker of such quality that when they take to the pitch, defenders panic.
Right now, Fellaini makes defenders panic. In some instances, 2 players mark him.
By contrast, Falcao is easy to defend against and requires no special attention.
We already have 2 aging strikers (Rooney, RVP). Lets not buy another.
For us to even consider buying him now, he needs to score at least 10 goals in the remaining 2 games...which would be difficult for Ronaldo, let alone Radamel "4 goal a season" Falcao.

If we want someone who can draw fouls and pass the ball, there are better midfielders out there.
We want a striker - ie. someone who can put the ball at the back of the net. 
Falcao has done this 4 times, in half a season.
A striker who can only score 4 goals in half a season, is not good enough to play for Leicester, let alone Man Utd.

9975~~~
His shove into the Palace defender's back basically got us CL football again. Hero.

9976~~~
Well, give him as many chances as Falcao and then rate them both.

Atleast there is upside with Wilson also with the game was going he would have been useful going in behind them as they were pushing high.

And also Falcao has been ordinary throughout for us. Even in U21 games.

9977~~~
I thought he was sharp today. Didn't really get much service but none of our strikers really do in this team

9978~~~
and the funny thing is he's not much worse than Rooney..

9979~~~
Wilson could at least get around the pitch, chase defenders down, and because he's young would play with little fear,
I've no clue what Falcao offers us, his mobility is poor, his strength holding up the ball is poor, I swear to god I've never seen someone just.. fall over more times for us  than he's done in his cameo's this season.

Would loved to have a Benteke type to bring on today, strength and mobility to occupy defenders/hold up play when we were under pressure.

9980~~~
Well thats one way to put pushing a defender

9981~~~
maybe he tries to look as shit as possible to lower his transfer fee to bang 30 next season in dry shirt..

9982~~~
Ah yes, that 1 under 21 game.

9983~~~
Disagree. He was a lot stronger on the ball today and made some promising runs. If he was given a decent chance today, I am confident he would have scored. Looks like a very likeable guy as well and at least he is willing to work.

9984~~~
It wasn't anywhere near as bad as the push against him he was crucified for against Chelsea. Delaney goes over like a sack of shit.

9985~~~
Would have scored if Young had trusted hi/spotted him. Played decent and worked his ass off.

World class assist for Fellainis goal. Didn't see it until the replays much later on. Brilliant.

9986~~~
Mendes. It's not about de gea but an even bigger deal. 

(Those of you that have been around long enough know not to question my sources.)

9987~~~
That's the scary thing. Shows how overrated Rooney actually is.

9988~~~
He was better than Rooney today when we actually attacked he was involved and set up Herrera who was denied by a good save. Certainly wasn't pointless.

9989~~~
Sure, wasnt the worst foul ever but we had luck on our side this time. Another time the foul gets called

9990~~~
I think that was probably one of the most accomplished striking performances we've seen this year and definitely Falcao's best in 2015. Nothing spectacular by any means but if he'd played like that for most of the season I'd have considered him a relatively successful signing.

9991~~~
Similar performance to what is Rooney putting every week since the Tottenham game. Only difference is that one is called Silent Dominator and the other is called shit.

9992~~~
Looks like a player who wants to stay here, actually. Of course that doesn't mean anything since Van Gaal has instructed him to play in a way that helps the team. But it was nice to see he wasn't playing for Falcao, passing it to players who were in a better position.

9993~~~
Some of his build up play in the final third on a couple of occasions was good.

9994~~~
Ronaldo is coming home!

9995~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

9996~~~
Difference is Rooney can take the ball forward, take it wide, play it cross field or play it forward. Or even burst beyond the high line off a long ball.

Falcao just comes deep and passes it 5 yards backwards or to the nearest man. When we were under the cosh and not many around him it meant the ball kept coming back into the pressure zone of a congested midfield. Not his fault but there was no outlet except Young.

9997~~~
This thread is comedy gold.

9998~~~
So are you implying he isn't?

9999~~~
Will soon become our all time biggest goal scorer etc.

10000~~~
And that is great. He is a very good player but he gets heralded as one of the Worlds best strikers when he is absolutely nowhere near.

10001~~~
Some good runs and worked hard but it's impossible to judge our strikers when we don't create a single chance for them.

10002~~~
When he's on top form (yeah i know), he's up there with any striker. Before last season, he had more goals and assists in the Prem for the prior 4 years, than any other player in the league.

10003~~~
I trust you man.

10004~~~
Funny, I could have sworn he came on at half time but I didn't see him for the rest of the game, so I assume I must have been mistaken...

10005~~~
He did enough today for this thread not to be bumped to be fair. Thought his play with Herrera was good.

10006~~~
No, think you need specsavers mate

10007~~~
He has tended to come on and put in a tidy performance or cameo the past couple of months but people will rush into here to shit on his performance regardless. As usual some nice runs and decent built up play today, very unlucky that Young didn't pick out his run at the near post.

10008~~~
After he moved into midfield, where he proved he wasn't scared to shoot at the slightest chance of an opening.

10009~~~
Did all right today. Made some useful runs and dragged defenders with him. No service to speak of but he was always a willing outlet.

10010~~~
He did no more or less than many of his other cameo performances, but normally he gets slated on here. Apparently everyone is just in a better mood after a win, but his performance was no better.

10011~~~
Have a look at his thread.

10012~~~
No I'm not, i'm capable of judging a performance as something other than amazing or dogshit, there's quite a large patch in the middle you know? Obviously not, you've either got a seriously bad case of bipolar or you're a bit of tool, I'm going for the later. Have a look at this thread and you'll see plenty of people 'ranting' the same as me.

10013~~~
I think he did as well as could be expected given that we barely touched the ball at all in the final 3rd. He put himself about when called upon defensively too.

10014~~~
For us United fans on here most think the same which I do to. But on the whole he is still regarded one of Europe's best strikers which is absurd really. He is even one of the cover stars of the fecking FIFA games <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

10015~~~
Will have to agree to disagree then because I thought he done as well as could be really. He has been a fail here but some of the slating on here is absolutely ridiculous. He can't be faulted for anything today yet people will always find a way.

10016~~~
Completely agreed. I'm not a fan, but he wasn't poor today.

10017~~~
Its been like that from the beginning. That interplay cameo in and around the box, that he was involved in leading towards Fellaini's goal, was what I have been dying to see all season.  Falcao made that happen and if we had more skillful/ creative midfielders I am sure he would have performed much better this season. My dream for next season is Falcao and RVp alternating on top, a creative attacking midfielder with DiMaria and Depay/ Nani on the wings. Then having DiMaria, Depay/ Nani and the creative midfielder constantly interchanging and linking up with our No9.

10018~~~
I agree that the criticism has been over the top at times. Especially when all of our strikers have struggled through the season in this system. However he was obviously less effective than Rooney pre-injury in the first half, which completely undermines that argument in this particular game. In games like this where we're being put under consistent pressure, his complete inability to be able to hold up the ball is a real problem.

10019~~~
Absolutely. I'm coming across as a proper Falcao fanboy now. To be honest I never really cared either way, but after the ridiculous amount of criticism he's received I can't help but want to defend him. I wouldn't say his performances have been great, but nobody except De Gea has performed consistently well this season. Our best outfield player has probably been Young, and even he's been hit and miss. And even in good performances his crossing has been dire, even if he does get one in fifteen right. Just how Hernandez has been labelled as crap by United fans, he goes to Real and (when he plays) he scores. It's always the players' fault, never the club, isn't it? It couldn't be that we're just not setting Falcao up.

10020~~~
Never mind the fact that he offers next to Nothing in the final 3rd... some of his "defending" today was highly questionable... he got in the way of actual defenders and got very lucky with a couple of fouls which on other days would not have been called.

Lets call time on this failed experiment... as 3rd choice striker, I really can't see what having having him over Wilson or Young or DiMaria or Fellaini up front really offers

10021~~~
It will be annoying if we have spent a season playing him into some form and fitness, for some other club next season.

10022~~~
Today he was surpisingly good for me. His touch was decent and he played a part in the goal by being a nuisance and gave Fellaini the chance to actually score.

10023~~~
You highlighted some text there and then replied to something else entirely. It was very confusing.
You also can't refer to someone having a "seriously case of bipolar". Grammatically speaking that is. 

When I look around this thread, and many others, what I see is you fighting with people. Consistently. 
Almost all of your posts reply with a sarcastic question or a narky comment. 

Might I suggest you tone it down a notch or two and keep your petty arguments for the playground?

As for your "point", the patch in the middle of "amazing" and "dogshit" is considerably smaller when you are rewarded with hundreds of thousands of pounds a week for scoring goals in football matches. I can't stress this enough, he has one job. He didn't even look like doing it today. At any stage.

Any of the very few players in world football who make money comparable to him, have the ability to make and score goals for themselves, regardless of how their teammates are playing. I'm not even asking him to do that. I just want to see him make an intelligent run. The sort I would expect from a professional striker playing in the Championship.

10024~~~
The man who can do no right. Failed to score a 40 yarder for the 20th consecutive game.

10025~~~
He wasn't as bad as usual.  That's about it.  If a decent striker had played like that you'd say they had an off game.

10026~~~
He was good today. Held the ball up better than usual, got into some great positions that were ignored by Young more than once and played a lovely ball into Herrera right at the death. Fair play to him.

10027~~~
What? Most of his shots actually came in the first half out of nothing.

10028~~~
Good play actually.

Find it strange that only Fellaini looks up to pass to him though. Young missed some opportunities from crosses to find him.

10029~~~
Did fine. He's no longer the mobile striker we need though. Pity.

10030~~~
No they didn't. I distinctly remember Young crossing one towards him and van Persie shooting wide with his left foot. I also remember him taking a free kick, which was on target and the long range shot in the second half, from nothing.

10031~~~
No I really haven't. You've described it as a brutal performance and my first sentence was about forming an opinion that isn't extreme, how have you not understood that?

Again I'm in danger of sounding like a Falcao sympathiser, for the record I don't feel like he's good enough for the club but I take issue with people who think its big and clever to spout the same bullshit regardless of what's happening in the game. He played well, nothing amazing but it certainly wasnt a 'brutal performance, I can only assume that choice of words was for dramatic effect. It's the one track thinking my better half expects from her reception class.

Classy move, call someone petty and pull them up on their grammar all in the same post. Top marks.

Ah I see, so really it seems like its you who has been stalking me, still no idea who you are by the way but its nice to be noticed.

10032~~~
He wasn't that bad today but he wasn't needed for the situation we were in.

10033~~~
Can anybody clarify whether he actually exists?

10034~~~
I completely disagree. He had two "key passes" which was the second most on the pitch, whereas the last time he played a half of football - Everton - he had 0. In 90 mins against Chelsea he had one. That's not just some pointless stat either, they were genuine chances created and with a bit of luck Herrera would've scored from a slick one-two and Young would've scored from a 1-on-1 and Falcao would've killed off the game with two assists with incisive counter-attacking play. Both were almost perfect passes from Falcao and the kind of thing we've rarely seen from him. So he contributed more positively than he generally does which is why he's being praised by some on here.

More importantly his negative contributions were far fewer. His biggest criticism this season has been how easily he loses the ball and there's justification for that - according to the stats he loses the ball more than anyone else in the team, mainly driven by him miscontrolling the ball. It's confirmed by the stats and we all know exactly what these stats are pointing to - the ridiculous amount of times he's received the ball with his back to goal and it's bounced off him or he's just fallen over. Today he wasn't dispossessed once and had just 1 unsuccessful touch. Against Everton he was dispossessed 3 times and had 5 unsuccessful touches; in other words he lost the ball more than anyone else on the pitch last time out, whereas today he was no worse than anyone else.

You can brush that off as irrelevant stats telling being moulded to fit a narrative but that's plainly not the case. Put simply he loses the ball a shitload of times in almost every game he plays these days and contributes very little when he actually manages to bring it under control. Today that clearly wasn't the case. It's got nothing to do with emotions after the game.

10035~~~
He did alright today but in my opinion every minute Falcao is on the pitch is a missed minute of playing time for Wilson. Why LVG is playing a player who is clearly past his best and won't be here next season ahead of a young promising player from the academy baffles me.

10036~~~
Good game today, should definitely start against Arsenal.

10037~~~
I think you just answered your own question. Its becoming obvious to me that Falcao will be here next season, whether its another loan or a full transfer.

10038~~~
I looked at your post history this evening precious! Don't read too much into it.

The fact that your better half is a teacher but you think good grammar is petty, tells me I've invested more time in this than is worthwhile.
I'm going to place you on ignore now, lest you think I'm stalking you and feel the need to accuse me of "bipolar" again!

10039~~~
If he's still here next season in lieu of a new striker or even retaining Hernandez I will weep big girly, sissy tears.

10040~~~
He created a good chance for Herrera and also made a good pass for Young(the long ball which young didn't control). Usually his output is a complete 0.

10041~~~
I'll be honest - I can't remember the Young 1 on 1 you're referring to. The Herrera chance was when Palace were chasing the game and we had a lot of room to play into. It wasn't a difficult ball to play and if anything, I thought he played it badly as he drilled it at Herrera at knee height making the volleyed finish very difficult.
The only thing I will say is that he seemed less useless with space to play in. When we've been the ones needing the goal playing against 10 men behind the ball, like the Chelsea and Everton games you refer to, he's a bystander.

I'm sure I remember one incident of him falling over with his back to the center back. There was another incident that sticks out in my mind, where his first touch bounced off his shin but went to straight to Valencia I think it was. I'm struggling to remember any good pieces of hold up play where he was under pressure to be honest.

Perhaps because I've lost all faith that he'll make it here, I'm noticing his failings more than his contributions. Whatever the reason, I can't remember an incident during today's game where I thought 'that was good!'.

10042~~~
I thought he did OK. We barely got in their half for large parts of the second half, when we did we lost the ball before it was anywhere near him.

10043~~~
Impressive today

10044~~~
Van Persie had 10 shots against WBA, 6 out of those were on target.

10045~~~
Yes, and, at least, half were created by team mates. One was a penalty, too.

10046~~~
Played well today but again, no service to our strikers.

10047~~~
I don't know how much truth there was to it but several pundits said that the Falcao loan was just a loan officially due to FFP but that he was destined to sign permanently for Man Utd.

10048~~~
You know what?

Unfortunately, I think we've already signed Falcao.

This 'loan' malarkey is probably just a loophole that we / Monaco have exploited - probably regarding FFP.

10049~~~
If we had lost, he'd be generally slated. We won, so it's more or less positive.

He contributed very little. Not sure he touched the ball more than once in his first 30 minutes.

10050~~~
We were very poor in the second half. And he actually played Young and Herrera in, in the space of 15 seconds; one of the two quite easily could have scored. 

His best performance in a long time, he looked far more confident than he has recently, too.

10051~~~
In no way am I trying to justify Falcao's performances this season because he's gotten the basics wrong quite often. But I think we've done no favours for our strikers this season with our style of play.

Our attack is predictable. Take seemingly 50 passes to get the ball wide and put in a cross. We hardly play the ball through the middle where the striker is unless it's a long ball over the top. Anywhere near the 18 yard box it's always going to go wide for a cross. With the way we play the only strikers that are going to have success are someone like Aguero who can beat players on his own or someone like Crouch who'll get on the end of these crosses.

10052~~~
I had to watch streaming the phone but from what I saw, completely useless! Part of it seems to be the tactics but still, if he doesn't fit after this much opportunity, I can't see him ever coming good. Sad to see but what can you do? Just glad a loan looks like a godsend now

10053~~~
Upgrade your phone.

10054~~~
Not really. He did miss the penalty, but majority of the shots were out of nothing, few good ones too.

10055~~~
He seemed to do as little as he usually does to me. I'm slightly baffled at the praise he's getting on here to be honest.

Sly little push for the 2nd goal was good though.

10056~~~
Not sure why we're even debating this. I thought he was impressive, too. His movement seems to be on another level to the others, which is why he had so many opportunities.

10057~~~
He worked hard, wasn't bad, but ultimately he has just such little quality these days. Defenders aren't scared of him in the slightest.

The fact that he played two decent passes, and thats being talked up as if it was something special, says it all really.

10058~~~
I'm watching a replay of the 2nd half right now on my TV... What am I missing? There's nothing there in terms of hold up, link up, penetrating runs, dragging away defenders, etc. Plenty of ways to affect a performance without scoring but I can't see what he's done to help us win, today or any other day.

10059~~~
This. I remember those 2 passes and him maybe pushing someone and that's it. If you want, United could sign me and I'd push loads of people. I might even kick some of them.

10060~~~
He did better than usual but that's partially because standards have slipped to the stage where it's an improvement if he can run 15 yards at any sort of speed without falling over. We were largely terrible in the second half which explains why according to the BBC he touched the ball 4 times in his first 30 minutes, in fairness he did play 2 good passes late on when Palace were committing players forward and leaving more gaps. 

It will still be utter fecking insanity if he we keep him next season, surely Mendes doesn't have that much control over the club.

10061~~~
The thing is, expectations are so low now that we need to keep in mind how much money we are talking about. He's on one of the highest wages in the squad, and 40 million on top of that. Even based on his performance today, he's not much more than a 10 million fee, 70k per week squad player. Anything else is simply mental.

10062~~~
Well, we're going to find out very soon.

10063~~~
Good job avoiding any football related points <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Its a football forum which I access through my mobile, grammar isn't mine or pretty much anyone else's priority. Oh and Looking into someones post history doesn't sound at all stalkish... Ciao.

10064~~~
He's one of the highest earners in world football, never mind our squad. 

Its amazing how not doing anything spectacularly bad, is now considered a good performance.

10065~~~
We have already agreed to sign him. Ed woodwarfeckedupd

10066~~~
What matters is whether there were signs of improvement in a player who has recovered from an injury that could have been career-ending, has struggled for full match-fitness since, has understandably had a hit to his confidence, and who has rarely started and only come on for minutes at a time in games where he's often had little service. I saw those signs of improvement, as did a few others. If the coaching staff saw the same thing, he might well stay, and if so I can't back this with anything but intuition, but I think we'll be pleasantly surprised next season.

10067~~~
He gets into good positions in the box and his team mates don't pass to him. Especially Young. Why?

10068~~~
Struggling to see how everyone seems to think that we've signed him. If we had there would be no chance in hell that Monaco would be saying we might still sign him. If anything that leads more to though pattern that we've said, no and they're trying to drum up interest in their player.

10069~~~
Sigh.

I take it you missed the points in the game where he tracked back to good use, set our players in behind (Young and Herrera in quick succession) caused confusion in the box for the winner (borderline foul but still..) and used his ability and hold up play very well.

It amazes me that some guys on here only look at certain aspects of a players game to draw their conclusions on how well a player is performing. Falcao today was probably the best that we've seen him yet, but because he received no service as a lone front man and was clearly instructed by LVG to come deep and look to play in other player who perhaps have more pace (Which he did very well) then he obviously had a shocker, bollocks! 

I feel for Falcao, he returned from a serious injury, missed the world cup, had zero pre-season, came to us on loan while we were in transition for a second season adopting to a new manager and new coaching staff, new style of play, new team mates, new country, new tempo of play. all of this on no pre season and recovering from the pain of missing the world cup and he was expected to score 300 goals a season and play like Georgie mardona pelemessialdo.

10070~~~
No, but he was expected to contribute much more than he has and also be able to at least show basic football skills.

10071~~~
Except that no one is saying he had a shocker. Most are actually saying he did better then normal. Which in itself tells you everything you need to know, as he was decent at absolute best today. You talk about him tracking back, playing two good passes (passes that I'd expect any PL standard player to make quite frankly) and holding the ball up. Well if thats good enough for a player thats costing us £250k p/w and possibly £43 million in the Summer, then you have incredibly low standards.

The amount of excuses this lad gets because he's a fancy name, is quite frankly bordering on cult like status. And fwiw, he did have a pre-season with Monaco, so that excuse doesn't wash. Neither does the new club/country/teammates/style etc etc because that applies to every signing any club make, unless you expect all new signings to play like they've never seen a football in their life before?

10072~~~
Falcaos massive pre-season:

Valencia - 02/08/14 -on as a sub 70th minute.
Arsenal - 03-08-14 - off as a sub 56th minute.
Lorient (ligue1) - 10-08-14 - on as a sub 59th minute.
Bourdeaux (ligue1) -17-08-14 - on as a sub 59th minute.
Fc Nantes (ligue1) - 24-08-14 - off as a sub 69 minutes)

So since he did his cruciates in January, Falcao had played a massive total of 185 minutes of football prior to signing for us, you're right that is one hell of a pre season he's had there. plus adopting to a new culture, style, manager, team mates, league, language, expectations which are blinded by a huge proportion of Uniteds spoilt following. To dismiss these thing as nothing is either naive or stupid, i'll let you decide which.

10073~~~
We need to sign up Georgiemardona pelemessialdo he sounds like an amazing player.

10074~~~
ffs, how is this thread open?  This guy is done.  He looks slow and lost.  It's like a hot potato that nobody wants to be left holding at his wages.

10075~~~
This (Falcao situation) is where I think football is missing a trick.

Take your pick of any player in the world right now. Doesn't matter who. Just one player you would love United to get hold of for a astronomical transfer fee.

Yes I accept Bale would be nicer to have to Bebe but there's no guarantee.

'Option to by' transfers struck a chord with me back when 'Bosman' came to the fore and 'could' if done correctly make much more sense now a player's wages are more relevant to both the buying and selling club than the transfer fee.

10076~~~
This is what I fear, <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

10077~~~
He doesn't do much. Where's the improvement over the season as he gets acclimatised and back to full fitness?

10078~~~
Changed my mind on him...

It's very hard to score goals when no will feed you passes, when you makes runs....Especially hard when they make sidewards passes the whole time.

Not his fault he's not scoring....He's either on the bench, or being fed by as shit scared 10 men, who pass the ball sideways

10079~~~
I remember Andy Cole having that same problem until a light bulb switched on halfway through his first season season. I am sure we all though we over-paid or he wouldn't hack the brighter lights of OT.

10080~~~
He'll be in the team next season.

10081~~~
How he has any people wanting him to return next year is beyond me. He did absolutely nothing today and it's being described as decent? Really? Someone on his wages?

He has one shot on target since January. It's May. Wake the feck up.

10082~~~
Why we had persisted with subbing him in the 2nd half when clearly he had always been ineffective, this I will never understand

10083~~~
Totally agree. Get a couple of creative midfielders with an eye for short progressive passes and through balls and we will see a different Falcao

10084~~~
I feel the same, when his agent was spouting out about how he would have scored a shed load of goals under SAF i cringed but with the system we play it requires a target man to sacrifice himself to make space for players running from deep.

If we had one of those deeper players to feed him im sure it'd work for him

10085~~~
So you want us to either buy certain types of players OR change our system, just so that Falcao, may (or may not) score?
I can understand us changing our players or system for Aguero, Ronaldo, Messi, Robben or even Bale....but Falcao?
You'd have to be crazy.

And if its true that he has only 1 shot on target since January, then that stat in itself is pretty damning.
Sometimes players dont do well in certain teams and this may be the case with Falcao. Its better for his own career that he move to a team which suits him better. Perhaps he should go back to A.Madrid - he previously did very well, there?
I think Falcao needs to make the decision himself, because right now, his name is strongly becoming synonymous with the word, "shit".

10086~~~
Had a decent game yesterday but people seem to have forgotten he's missed loads of chances this season. No guarantee he would finish those chances even if we did create anything.

10087~~~
I would have agreed with you if it were only Falcao, but our lack of creative midfielders has also affected RVP and even Rooney when he played up front.
Three proven goalscorers could not all have become "shit" in the same season. There must be some other mitigating factor.

10088~~~
Can't beat his man for pace, nor has the skills to create space for himself. Is a pale shadow of the player he once was for a quarter of a mill a week (or whatever he's on) he should be doing far better. You go on like he's feeding on scraps at Burnley, the system may not suit him but he should still be doing far far better.

10089~~~
Serious question - what could cause a player to fall over so much? I thought he did alright yesterday but he still fell over a couple of times, as has been the norm all season. My guess would be his legs aren't as quick as they used to be and he's not yet come to terms with that.

10090~~~
My guess is that as a result of his injury, he was unable to do lower body workouts for quite some time.  On the contrary he was able to do upper body workouts hence why Falcao looks yoked up.  Now he's recovered so he should be able to strengthen his lower body via workouts.

10091~~~
Oh shut up. Everyone was slipping yesterday. De Gea slipped. Ward slipped. Jones slipped. Evans slipped. Smalling slipped. 

Points more to the pitch than Falcao not being able to do lower body workouts. Some of you spout some shite. 

Does anyone know why Falcao blinks so much? It's obviously hindering his ability to see properly.

10092~~~
Do we lack those creative midfielders?

10093~~~
How many through passes have you seen from mata and Herrera? How much central interplay with our strikers? How much turning and facing our opponents' goal do you see from them? They don't even dribble pass defenders thus opening spaces for our strikers. Back and side passes is not creativity.

10094~~~
Yeah he wasn't too bad for it yesterday, but in general throughout this season it has been quite annoying. It got to point where in some scenarios I just expect him to fall over.

10095~~~
Would have loved for it to work. It hasn't. It's not us Radamel its you... But there's plenty of other clubs in the sea

10096~~~
I think during our good run of form, LvG has focused on exploiting the interchanging on the flanks and half space more than centrally thru the strikers. Mata is not a dribbler and Herrera I don't think is allowed to do so

10097~~~
Just watching the Chelsea Vs pool game. Hoping for even a draw. Anyway it is clear that of all the teams in the top 4 we have the least skillful midfielders.
There is no way that we can challenge teams like, Bayern, Real or Barca with our current midfield, however, if RVP and Falcao return to there former glory, assisted by a creative midfield, then we can compete.

10098~~~
If what you say is indeed true the how can you expect our central strikers to shine. I am sure next season we will have different CMs but I am not sure about strikers.

10099~~~
So he is in a great form but nodoby is feeding him with passes..?

10100~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-united/9848540/Radamel-Falcao-s-mother-hopes-son-can-shine-at-Man-Utd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-...alcao-s-mother-hopes-son-can-shine-at-Man-Utd</a>

Still a better punditry input than Jamie Redknapp, I suppose.

10101~~~
That's one of the most sensible interviews I've ever read with a footballer's family member.

10102~~~
Do we have a Players Mum of the year award?

10103~~~
Don't let the door hit your arse on the way out

10104~~~
His mother can stay, though.

10105~~~
How many times, Mendes is not God!

10106~~~
God isn't looking after his goal scoring record and he's dropped a bollock in Nepal too. What's he doing up there?

10107~~~
It is indeed.

Now read the bollocks sensationalist headline the BBC website have put on the same story.
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32722427" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32722427</a>

I hate journalists.

10108~~~
Bah, I was expecting it to say something like<i> "God shall smite Manchester!" - Mrs Falcao</i>

10109~~~
God must be really busy these days looking after footballers careers... no wonder there is so much misery in the world, the big guy obviously has his hands full.

10110~~~
Why in god's name is he getting another start tomorrow? 

At this stage, what is the actual point?

10111~~~
Scoring the winner in the 94th minute.

10112~~~
OT Farewell for him

10113~~~
We've got top 4, injuries and we're paying him £300k+ a week?

10114~~~
Yeah...but he's shite.

10115~~~
when you remember the excitement before his home debut v QPR, it's such a shame seeing him starting for the last home game is such an underwhelming thing.

Football is a funny old game for sure, but am really hoping Van Gaal doesn't spring a surprise on us regarding him. Even a lengthened loan would seem odd, but a permanent signing would be baffling.

10116~~~
DDG? <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

10117~~~
Yeah I'm well aware.

10118~~~
rather we played Wilson. Arsenal will no doubt play a high line and a target man will be useless against per. Better to have some speed in behind.

10119~~~
Get the banners, scarves, hats in tact! Falcao's Old Trafford farewell lads.

<i>The best there is, the best there was, the best there ever will be. - Bret Hart</i>

10120~~~
After what transpired out, I'm not sure any of Mendes' clients deserve anything any longer from United.

Wilson is on fire and his U21 team just won the league, so it's a no-brainer for me.

10121~~~
Probably trying to keep De Gea's agent sweet by pretending that there's a chance you'll sign Falcao.

10122~~~
I really hope he scores tomorrow and gets a good send off from the OT faithful. We won't be signing him, and he is of course useless, but it would still be nice.

10123~~~
I've got almost the same chance of scoring tomorrow, as he has...and I'm not even a registered Man Utd player.
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10124~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10125~~~
This is true. I've never faulted his effort though. Falcao will leave United with more of my respect than Anderson, for instance.

10126~~~
Quick question: has Falcao ever started as a lone striker at United?

10127~~~
Stamford Bridge a few weeks ago.

10128~~~
Its easy to make fun of someone when they are down but I suspect Falcao will have the last laugh. Our present style of football does not cater for skillful ball to feet strikers, give him he right midfield set up and he will once again shine. I hope it will be with us but I know most would rather have Mata and Rooney as our major players thus ensuring us fighting for a CL place next season and of course not winning anything.
Falcao would shine in an Arsenal set up never mind Barca, Real and Bayern.

10129~~~
Knowing our luck, this will happen.  100%.

I've been saying this for years, and I will say this again: Rooney has been holding us back for ages.  We should've got rid when we had the chance.

10130~~~
Have I missed something? How do people know he is going to start?

10131~~~
they have inside info from the club

10132~~~
Is rvp injured?

10133~~~
He can't control a fecking orange nevermind a ball. What kind of midfield does he need behind him then? Can't see Aguero complaining about the midfield behind him when Silva with his ups and downs is the only player that can produce something as Yaya has been very hit and miss this season and neither Octopussy nor Fernandinho are able to create anything.

Same stuff was said about Kagawa, he sure has been shining this season, like fecking diamonds in the sky, oh ayy.

10134~~~
Thanks.

Why is he starting? There is no point! Just feck off already.

10135~~~
He obviously hasn't done enough to warrant sticking around, no matter the price. That said, I hope he has a fantastic, memorable game that leaves the fans singing his name. He's worked hard here and deserves to leave with a great Old Trafford memory.

10136~~~
If previous experience teaches us anything, it is that he will come on as a sub tomorrow and touch the ball once per 10 minutes.

10137~~~
Id rather play with no striker than have Falcao. Just fecking leave already.

10138~~~
There are many other lads on the bench who work just hard but havent been given an ounce of the playing time he has. It is irrelevant what kind of send off this mercenary gets.

10139~~~
He's going to score atleast one against Arsenal.

10140~~~
The guy cannot trap a ball properly for us and you think it is our midfield's fault that he has been absolutely tosh? Some of you lot would discredit anyone and everyone to support your favorite player. Moreover, this constant notion that every striker will shine in an Arsenal set up is bs.

10141~~~
hopefully in the right net.

10142~~~
LVG has given him too many chances to prove himself and he has taken none.  He's just not the player he once was.  Tbh I'd rather start with Wilson if RVP is unavailable.

10143~~~
Please start Wilson <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> What's the point of starting him anymore I can't understand

10144~~~
I think this is his last chance to prove himself that he is back. A couple of spectacular goals will do the trick. But i highly doubt it.

10145~~~
I don't get how people are still making excuses for him, when it was absolutely crystal clear in December that he's not gonna be the player he once was, that he wouldn't succeed here (or anywhere else to the same degree). 

I was a huge fan of his when he played for Atletico and Porto, but he hasn't even shown glimpses of the ability he used to have back then, today he has absolutely none. People are hating on Evans, but I think Falcao has been our worst performer of the season. I don't blame him, since I think his injuries have ruined him. People are expecting him to perform, but his problems are too big for him to come back. He's slow and weak, which makes his technique look bad. I don't hate him or anything, but he seems finished in my eyes.

10146~~~
Wilson or an unfit RVP I would much rather see than Falcao.

10147~~~
Because it was premature based on circumstances. How many times do people have to spell it out? He had zero pre season with us, was settling into a foreign country and new surroundings and we played anti football for months. Yes Anti football. I don't care who you are. Obviously the injuries hurt us BUT so did playing 3 at the back. It's been a difficult season for the team but if you cannot look at something and be logical about things if you don't consider these things. Most people turned off him, initially out of the belief that we wouldn't sign him round xmas - partly because of the reported fee. I felt it too, but we just don't know. Clearly he needs momentum which we've just not been able to get. Next season is different and so LVG will mull it over. We also have Robin to consider etc.

10148~~~
He should have stopped being in contention ages ago.

10149~~~
I still believe in Falcao. I am comfortable with him up front.

10150~~~
You sound like the people slating on Young and Fellaini last season, only to turn around and be like "oh I stand corrected".

There should be a points system on redcafe where everytime you slate a United player and are proven wrong, rather than getting off with a pansy ass smile and "I was wrong," you get demoted to the newbies. People who are so consistently wrong in their valuation of players and so hostile towards players who wear the United shirt have no business posting.

10151~~~
Even if he scored 5 today, it doesn't change the fact that he's been very poor this season and we should not sign him. I don't see a reason why he has to play (unless Rooney plays in midfield and RVP/Wilson are injured).

10152~~~
How many times have someone said something like this in this thread?The chap was overprotected too much by some of the fans here, even more than the youth players.

10153~~~
Yep. That game against Preston I think did it for most people.

10154~~~
Does it really matter? You have 4th, you probably wont get 3rd even if you win today so he might as well start and see if he can start 'banging them in'

10155~~~
I would rather start Wilson, why invest in somebody who won't be here next year when we have a bright talent on the bench. The club need a serious look at themselves if they sign falcao permanently.

10156~~~
Thought the  story is that you will be signing him or extending the loan deal until January?

10157~~~
Wait we are keeping him? He's going to cost a small fortune in transfer fees and wages. Not worth it.

10158~~~
I will never undersrand why he is starting instead of Wilson especially after the game Wilson had for the u21s vs City.

10159~~~
In current form, he would need a midfield of Suarez, Messi and Ronaldo behind him.

10160~~~
I know you're probably playing devils advocate because you were criticising him from the start when our fans were still fawning over his movement, but the truth is we've been having "let's see if he can start 'banging them in'" weekends since his arrival. It's clear he's contributed little so far and shouldn't be part of our future. There is nothing to gain from starting him - even if he scored a goal - we don't own him and won't be looking to sell him. Getting RvP back on form or giving Wilson a run would be far more beneficial to this club whichever way you look at it.

I can't put my finger on the exact game for me but it was just after the turn of the year I think. if we've come to the conclusion he has no future here and he isn't contributing then I can't see why he's still getting any games at all. I have nothing against him, I really wanted him to succeed here and he seems like a decent guy but playing him makes no sense to me.

10161~~~
Omg I think today is the day he scorez a hat trick

10162~~~
First I've heard about it, but I certainly wouldn't mind that.

10163~~~
Young was largely crap for three seasons prior to his unlikely resurgence under Van Gaal so the criticism was justified. On the other side of the coin are posters who refuse to accept players aren't good enough until those players are moved on to a lesser club. In any case, Falcao is too old and way, way too expensive to be afforded a lengthy bedding in period.

10164~~~
Not really bothered if he starts. He was fine when he came on against Palace.

10165~~~
Koscielny, is that you?.

10166~~~
The complaining is so boring and repetitive. 

What is it with people who like to complain and complain and get worked up about things that they have no control over. Entirely unnecessary stress you bring upon yourselves.

10167~~~
Unless it's people using football as an outlet for the stress they've built up in everyday life?

10168~~~
Yep, he definitely showed a good attitude coming on against Palace, making slidings, trying to set-up Herrera with a nice pass.

10169~~~
Hoping for him as much as us that he plays a blinder today. You can't fault the guy's effort it's just not happening for him at all. Always horrible to see a top player in decline (especially a decline as rapid as his).

10170~~~
Does 'using football' entails constantly moaning about Falcao playing or working yourself up over Chevrolet's logo on the front of our shirts? 

Having a stress outlet that seems to build up more stress, even over the tiniest of details, doesn't seem productive to me.

10171~~~
Somewhere there is the real Falcao and I hope today is the day where it all comes together.

10172~~~
If he scores a stunning hat trick today and then another next weekend, will you shell out his agreed fee (£40 odd million) for him?

10173~~~
Feels very much that we are already committed to keeping him, and probably have been from the outset with the "loan" just being an FFP dodge.

Our only way out is if someone else wants to sign him and expect the fee that anyone is willing to pay will be proportional to the get out fee in our deal. 

If no one wants him we either keep him or cut our losses and pay a fee to give him back. Keeping him to Jan and hoping he picks up form may be the least worst solution.

10174~~~
Wouldn't begrudge him a start today as I thought he did ok when he came on against Palace. It's a shame the way things have played out for him here. We've been waiting for him to catch fire but we are at the end of the season now and still waiting. Maybe if we had played more games this season with more opportunity for rotation things might have been different. I hope he signs off with a goal but fully expect this to be his last game in a red shirt at Old Trafford. Farewell, Radamel <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10175~~~
Given what has gone on with De Gea's contract, and the influence that Mendes undoubtedly has had, I see absolutely no reason why we should honour any sort of 'agreement' that we have with him to sign Falcao.

10176~~~
I would, because that would prove he still has what gave him the world class reputation.  We certainly need a striker of that level of quality.

10177~~~
I expect a hattrick from him today......<img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

10178~~~
Because he has one fecking shot on target since January. In what universe is that acceptable?

10179~~~
One last chance for him to have his "forlan moment" basically... Go on El Tigre

10180~~~
The more I think about it, the more insane his inclusion is. Absolutely insane.

10181~~~
Please continue moaning and thinking about it And thinking its insane. I hope it goes well for you.

10182~~~
Ok I am worried now.

10183~~~
How is a striker who is so unbelievably poor that he has literally managed one shot on goal since January (it's may, for your information) playing for us yet again? How is that defensible?

10184~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wsi4rjfpwdc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

10185~~~
Please Falcao, just turn on your charm. Just this one time.

10186~~~
One thing to bear in mind that Mario Gomez struggled in his and van Gaal's first season at Bayern, with just 14 goals in 45 appearances, and then something clicked and he scored 39 goals in 45 games the next season. Maybe van Gaal thinks the same can happen with Falcao? They're certainly similar kinds of players.

10187~~~
Is it May? Thank you for your condescending post.

10188~~~
Come on you little beast just recapture that form for one game before you leave, show us what you can do.

10189~~~
Slipping and sliding and falling over.

10190~~~
Get him a pair of decent boots for feck's sake.

10191~~~
Radamel Fallcao.

10192~~~
i'm hearing unconfirmed reports that falcao may have spent as much time on his feet as on the floor in this match for the first time in his united career.

10193~~~
"In honor of Steven Gerrard's last match at Anfield, I will slip and fall every time I touch the ball."

-Radamel Falcao, in a letter to the people's captain, Steven Gerrard

10194~~~
Well I think he's looked sharp so far despite having ice skates on, he's made some really intelligent runs and I think we might just need to release the ball to him a little quicker.

10195~~~
He really is completely useless. Has there been any explanation for him playing instead of RvP?

10196~~~
I feel sorry for him. His injury has permanently lessened his ability as a football and he knows it.

10197~~~
Hasn't really done anything wrong

10198~~~
Unfortunately, RvP is equally shit.

Actually thought Falcao has been good tbh.

10199~~~
No lack of effort. Really want him to score 

But it's sad looking at him

10200~~~
Unbelievable how far he has fallen..

10201~~~
Besides the slips I think he has been decent. Some good runs, pressed well, held up well under pressure at times and won the ball back.

10202~~~
Literally painful to watch. He tries to do everything right, but he fails to do anything. Should've changed the boots also.

10203~~~
Can't turn, can't run, finished.

10204~~~
He just looks shit and uninspiring on the ball. Like he has no spunk.

10205~~~
Besides losing the ball almost every time he had it?

10206~~~
He seems a bit slow

10207~~~
I despise Van Gaal for giving him minutes.

This was over 8 weeks ago, yet we persist.

10208~~~
Thought he's done alright. Made some good runs. For United-Falcao, this is actually a decent performance.

Still slips like a buttery bar of soap.

10209~~~
Objectively I'd say his performances this season would justify a £5-10m fee

10210~~~
Think he's been okay actually, some smart runs.

10211~~~
A bit more pace and his runs would be complemented nicely.

10212~~~
RVP wasn't fit enough to start (complained of being ill) and in fairness he has been doing the right things but seems to be running into slippery areas of the field (might be footwear) and has been a little unlucky.

10213~~~
He hasn't though. Just needs to change his boots to avoid slipping.

10214~~~
I agree, in fact he has so many opportunities where it was blatantly obvious he should have been played in, yet went unnioticed.

as for the slipping; Everyone has slipped this game. It's just a lot more noticeable with Falcao today. Phil Jones almost let a bloody goal in today because of it.

10215~~~
Yeah, he's certainly giving it his best go, but he just doesn't seem to have the legs for it.

10216~~~
Hasn't done anything really right either tbf

10217~~~
Hope he changes his boots.

10218~~~
Disagree entirely. RvP has had a much better season and looked pretty sharp the last time he played.

10219~~~
If only it were that simple.

10220~~~
The title change. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This video has never been more relevant to him: <iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OLbwUQaxr1B/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

10221~~~
No pace, no strength, no vision, no aerial ability and cannot even seem to shoot anymore.

10222~~~
Another woeful performance.  Slow...unable to hold the ball up...spends more time slipping than on his feet.  I pray to a higher being that we haven't already bought him and it just hasn't been announced yet.

10223~~~
Why are people saying stuff about him staying here on loan <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> has that been rumoured in the papers or something?! Would be so stupid

10224~~~
Definitely not the worst striker on the pitch

10225~~~
He hasn't been terrible. A few good runs etc, but seriously what is wrong with his boots?

10226~~~
Tancredi has said this: 'OFFICIAL: Falcao permanent clause surely NOT to be triggered as 15 league starts +5 goals needed= today Falcao had 13th start,1 game to go'

Whilst it was surely not going to be triggered months ago, I didn't hear about that supposed clause.

10227~~~
Hope he changes his boots and gets a goal in the second half. Would like to see him succeed here.

I have a sneaky feeling we might be keeping him because of the Mendes connection?

10228~~~
Unfortunately Danny Ings on a free would be better value.

10229~~~
Thread title <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10230~~~
As if there's a 15/5 clause. Who would even think of 15/5 as being any sort of watershed. 

"Oh yes well if he scores 5 goals in 15 games we will definitely sign him".

10231~~~
Respect. Great tribute of a game from Falcao to Slippy G.

10232~~~
Mega mega white thing. Mega mega. Shouting lager, lager, lager, lager.

10233~~~
Sounds like he just made that up...

10234~~~
It's not easy playing the lone sticker but just doesn't look right....

10235~~~
A bit better movement, needs to put on some iceskates at halftime

10236~~~
Okay, now Tancredi has really out done that clause tweet. He agreed with this response to his tweet: 'so you're saying they didn't let him play in previous weeks because of the risk of activating the clause?' <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

10237~~~
Sorry, but he's been pretty much useless out there. I'm not gonna praise him for not being as shit as usual. I like the guy but he has to give me something to work with.

10238~~~
His movement is decent, but when he gets the ball - even in threatening positions - he simply doesn't produce anything.

10239~~~
Nothing is official and nothing is absolutely true but back then in August when the loan was announced (and we were ecstatic <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>), many journos and french pundits said that due to FFP reasons (I really don't remember the exact details), the Falcao loan was basically an unofficial purchase. We'll find out very soon but the fact that he plays so much while being so bad is also telling.

10240~~~
I also remember those stories and I think Mendes said something similar about it being a permanent deal. Could be very embarrassing.

10241~~~
At the time no one knew he would be this bad but to take such a big financial risk on a player who was already declining before his injury at Monaco and just recently came back from it. Well I hope it's all lies.

10242~~~
Just fell down twice within the span of 5 seconds on the ball.

10243~~~
I love how hard he tries, but that's it unfortunately.

10244~~~

music to accompany this performance

10245~~~
Running looks like incredibly hard work for him. Looks like he's carrying a heavy backpack.

10246~~~
Working his bollocks off but his touch is brutal.

10247~~~
Fecking drama queen.

10248~~~
I'd say he's off so?

10249~~~
£40 million saved. Phew.

Half decent performance but still not good enough.

10250~~~
Goodbye Radamel. You at least put the graft in. Cant fault you for that.

10251~~~
Falcao waving goodbye to the Old Trafford crowd. Bye bye Radamel - sorry you couldn't do it for us.

10252~~~
There's the goodbye

10253~~~
With that goodbye wave I think we can now say for sure that he's leaving. That's reassuring. A shame we got him when he was a shadow of his old self.

10254~~~
Thanks for the memories. Adios.

10255~~~
Goodbye.

10256~~~
Waving goodbye to the crowd?

10257~~~
Goodbye falcao.

It was a great coup at first and if the real falcao came it could have been magical. It's best to sever ties though and let him settle somewhere else.

10258~~~
Something quite sad about that really.

10259~~~
That's the end of that experiment then, never been so excited about a signing in my life.

10260~~~
DDG to do the same?

10261~~~
Yes, multiple times

10262~~~
Thank feck.

10263~~~
Fallcao....<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> harsh 

Cheers Falcao. Didn't work out as we had hoped but best of luck with the future...unless u sign for another EPL outfit!

10264~~~
I feel sorry for the fella. He's been trying pretty hard today and looked pretty decent. 
Hard to see him doing so badly this season. 
I imagine he won't be staying.

10265~~~
Have you ever seen one of our players out on loan get so many minutes? Blocking a promising academy player with an overpriced, vertigo-suffering Columbian lump who can't stand up straight, let alone find the back of the net. And this from our manager with a legendary reputation for bringing through young players.

10266~~~

10267~~~
It was worth a punt, but it's good to see that there are definitely no question marks going forward.

10268~~~
Oh Radamel. The beautiful dream that never quite worked this season.

10269~~~
The guy did his best, but is past his best. Shame it did not work out for him here, hopefully it will elsewhere.

10270~~~
Fair to say that's his last game from that reaction...

10271~~~
Seems like a good guy and definitely put the effort in at least. Maybe a good pre-season and a new start at a new club will do him good but there's no way we can keep him anyway.

10272~~~
I have wanted him to leave all season, but when he went off I felt so bad.

10273~~~
Such a shame. Sadly, not the beast he once was.

10274~~~
Sad in a way. Hasn't shown anything to justify us spending that amount of money on him yet...he's always given 100% and is a likeable guy.

10275~~~
So you actually despise our manager for it?  Grow up.

10276~~~
That performance is why

10277~~~
While he wasn't that effective, he was far better at leading the press against Arsenal's defence than Van persie, who was completely useless. The Van Persie sub, coupled with natural tiredness as the game wore on, means we lost the urgency to win the ball back we had for the first 60 minutes or so. That allowed Arsenal to impose themselves more on the game. At this point I would take Falcao over RvP, but ideally we'll have neither next season.

10278~~~
feck it, sign him.

10279~~~
Even if it didn't turn out the way most of us had hoped in footy terms, I feel proud to be a United supporter hearing our supporters giving him a great goodbye. You get a better farewell after one unlucky/weak season here, than after twentywhatever years elsewhere. Good luck Falcao!

10280~~~
Just picture him driving his sports car back to his luxurious apartment, it helps.

10281~~~
True.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Title

10282~~~
It wasn't to be. All the best to him going forward. Football is a better place for having a fit and firing Falcao.

10283~~~
Hey....you know what, he's a really good guy. He will never be the same player he was, something has happened and it was worth the punt, just in case. I like him...and wish him well..

10284~~~
Actually felt sad seeing him wave goodbye. He really tried his arse off and it just seemed like it wasn't meant to be for him at Old Trafford.

10285~~~

10286~~~
File this one under "nice idea, didn't work".

Kudos for getting him on loan rather than buying him.

Where next for him? Italy?

10287~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/OLbwUQaxr1B/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

Harsh but still funny.

10288~~~
Sad exit, played ok today. A team needs to be setup to play to his strengths, he has not been getting the service he needs and opposition pretty much man mark him. Would love to extend the loan, but he aint worth £40m, and Monaco will struggle to get that price now.

10289~~~
Would remind ya of Forlan.

10290~~~
Was poor, but still better then RVP again

10291~~~
Except Forlan had a happy ending <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

10292~~~
It is rare when everyone agrees on the Caf.  Nice guy, shame that injuries have obviously taken their toll, time for him to go.

10293~~~
Its a shame, hoped it would have worked. All the best.

10294~~~
Chelsea <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

10295~~~
Looked to be waving goodbye but he definitely gave it his all today and looked better than RvP.

10296~~~
His constant slipping and falling over makes me think that hes still not fully recovered from his injury woes. There has to be something in him constantly falling over other than poor studs, i never saw as many players fail to keep their balance like he did today (or for most games this season)

10297~~~
All the best El Tigre.

10298~~~
Really glad to see the back of him, but it is a shame it didn't work out.  Seems a nice guy and the right kind of player you want to have at United.  Apart from the never actually playing any football part even when he was on the pitch.

Wish him the best.

10299~~~
My sentiments exactly. Class from OT. Wasn't for lack of effort from Falcao, hopefully he can rediscover his form elsewhere.

10300~~~
I couldn't fault his work rate or him for trying but he just doesn't have that cutting edge and he seems to be always a yard or two off the pace.

It's a pity things didn't work out for him this season and I'd be really surprised if LvG holds onto him too.

10301~~~
Works hard, commend the effort, just not good enough post injury sadly, goodbye.

10302~~~
Cheeky change to the thread name.

But yea, can't fault him for today, worked his ass off, good luck to him in recovering his form if it's even possible somewhere else.

10303~~~
Well at least he was better than Van Persie so that's something. Shame it's not worked out, not just for the benefit of the team but because he seems such a nice person. Glad we're not buying him though.

10304~~~
No doubt about that, I'd like to keep Fallcao if we can do a deal. Sadly, RVP looks finished.

10305~~~
I want him to stay for these reasons. Link provided to save duplicating my post. <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/we-need-a-new-striker.404751/#post-17533415">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/we-need-a-new-striker.404751/#post-17533415</a>

10306~~~
It's sad to see him left this way. He's done all his could and worked tirelessly throughout the hour. It's really hard to blame the lad for not scoring goals when there's no real decent service delivered to him. When he tapped the crest and waved goodbye to the fans tears started rolling down my cheeks. It shouldn't have ended this way..

10307~~~
Haha seriously?. Yes it's annoying he didn't show his best here, but he never once looked the same falcao. People say he got "no service" but look at giroud, he gets plenty of service but with no pace and dribbling ability unless balls are served on a plate they can't score. Top class strikers shouldn't be reliant on that.

10308~~~
My God he was shite today. Spent half the game on his arse and must be the slowest player on the pitch. I genuinely feel sorry for the guy though. The whole thing is such a pity. He could and should have been a United legend.

10309~~~
I really thought he'd have been the ideal premier league center forward and goalscorer. I suppose I didn't realize how much he had regressed due to his injuries. Can see him moving to La Liga this summer and rekindling some of his form.

Shame, really. We desperately need a new goalscorer.

10310~~~
When he went off, waved and patted the club badge without thinking I stood up and applauded him. It's a shame it didn't work out well for him here, comes across as a quite a nice chap. I hope he has better success elsewhere.

10311~~~
It's always a bit sad to see a player look a shadow of their former selves when they're not even 29/30.

10312~~~
I thought he played good the last 2 games saw signs of the old Falcao in terms of his running lines. Obviously still lacks sharpness and killer instinct and he is clearly low on confidence aswell but I have a feeling if he gets a couple of games going for him and could bang in those first few goals he could start growing to his best form again. 

Unfortunatley I think that will play out at another club and I fear we'll end up regretting not giving him another year. On the other hand you are never sure about these things and the performance this season doesn't warrant the kind investment needed to make his move a permanent one. 

Really have a double feeling over this. I just hope if he goes that RVP also goes because imo he looks far worse than Falcao and contrary to the latter I don't believe RVP can and will improve in fact I think he is well and truely past it and will only deteriorate more. If both go than atleast we'll be forced to bring in another striker and then I hope we get it bang on this time and bring in another 25+ striker ala Lacazette or somebody like Benteke.

10313~~~
I wanted to cry <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10314~~~
I feel sorry for the guy. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10315~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I feel for bad laughing though. Oh well, wish him the best!

10316~~~
Such a likeable guy but unfortunately that's irrelevant. He obviously shouldn't be bought on a permanent basis. Yet for some reason I'll still be sad to see him go.

That wave and kiss of the badge was sad <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10317~~~
Can anybody remember the four goals he scored? I remember Everton, Villa and Stoke but struggling to remember the other?

10318~~~
^ Leicester at home?

10319~~~
Leicester at home.

10320~~~
Thanks

10321~~~
Agreed. Can't we get him on loan for another season, for lower wages? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10322~~~
Nothing was more symbolic of his season here than that disastrous left footed volley.

10323~~~
Disappointed that it didn't work out for him, but he was shit all season. Shit her, shit there, shit everywhere, can't believe he started before RVP. Ridiculous.

10324~~~
Seems a good guy.  he tried and we certainly gave him plenty of opportunities but he doesn't look physically up to the task, wish him all the best (unless he goes scouse)

10325~~~
Why would you even want him on loan again? even Chicharito would be a better 3rd option off of the bench for us.

10326~~~
Feel bad for him but he just is not good enough. I hope he gets a better time of it at his next club.

10327~~~
It was worth a loan punt. In most instances a player of his quality would've contributed much more this year. All the best to him.

10328~~~
Good luck to him, it was a emotional good bye which nearly bought a tear to my eye!

It's a shame we can't keep him with Depay and ADM playing next season I think we need a predator like him!

10329~~~
It was definitely worth the gamble but unfortunately he's a shadow of what he used to be. If he had got back to his best it would have been amazing.

He seems like a decent guy who had respect for the club and I always wanted him to do well but it just wasn't happening so it's a relief in the end that he is leaving. 

I couldn't take another season of feeling sorry for him and hoping against the odds that he'd fluke a goal

10330~~~
I still think in the right team he can return to his former glory but one cannot justify keeping him here. He tries hard maybe to hard but his confidence is shot and as others have said he constantly slips and slides. I know other players in the first half also slipped but not as much as him and he has slipped a lot in other games.
I am beginning to think that our style of play does not suit South American or Iberian peninsula players. Ronaldo and Nani to a lesser extent are exceptional players but not many others have been successful here, though to be honest we have not had that many.

10331~~~
I think he has a pb with balance (maybe a bad result of his knee injury ?) and is weak so I don't think it's an issue of not being in the right team for him. He needs to have his basics right, controlling the ball, protecting the ball and only then will his confidence grow back.

10332~~~
I don't think he's adapted to the league. Physically he can't match premier league centre backs but he's always getting into battles which he can't win. This is why he's on the floor so much imo. Problem is I'm sure LVG is pretty strict on our only strikers positioning but I feel Falcao would do better if he drifted into space more often rather than playing with his back to goal. There's just no point whatsoever lumping it at him expecting him to hold the ball up. 

Shame it hasn't worked out as I was pretty excited about him. Wish him the best for the future he seems a nice person and works hard.

10333~~~
The goodbye was poignant. Everybody wanted this loan to work out so much but his body can no longer stand up to the rigors of elite level football. He should head to the MLS and enjoy the final few years of his career as a star.

10334~~~
Would have been great to see him perform the way he can. He tried his best but it just didn't work. Good luck to him in the future.

10335~~~
Appreciated the badge slaps, he clearly felt the love from the fans.

10336~~~
He's just physically shot, in terms of his pace especially. I wish him the best. I think he'd be smart to go to Serie A.

10337~~~
I feel sorry for him because he just couldn't seem to get many chances over the last few months. Unfortunately we haven't been the most creative team in the final third a lot of the time which has really impacted him.

Saying that he hasn't done enough since being here unfortunately. Hopefully we will invest in a more mobile striker

10338~~~
He'll probably score a bunch of amazing goals too. Robbie Keane's MLS highlight reel is ridiculous.

10339~~~
Disappointed it didn't work out for him here. He seemed like a genuinely good lad who wanted to play for us.

10340~~~
Dunno how he continues getting game time over Wilson.

Anyway, goodbye to him and good luck as long as he doesn't go to a direct rival.

10341~~~
I think he'll be here next season and that the deal is already done. Just my opinion but it wouldn't surprise me.

10342~~~
Agreed. Nothing against Falcao (I feel sorry for him, actually), but I don't think he's going to be here next season. Wilson is, so why not get him the game time? He's about as likely to get us a goal as Falcao is.

10343~~~
Amazing how so many people think he's crap but are simultaneously praying he doesn't sign with a rival.

10344~~~
I've seen enough from him now. He doesn't seem to have anything any more that you'd look for in a top class striker. 

Christ even Mata has more strength on the ball and he's a midget.

10345~~~
Nice guy. Physically just not up to the EPL. Perhaps Italy. You can see his brain working but he is just to easily out paced by not so pacey CBs or muscled off the ball. It was worth the risk but it just didn't come off.

10346~~~
100% pass accuracy today. 12 from 12. Recovered the ball 4 times. Made 2 defensive clearances. 1 blocked shot.

10347~~~
Too bad he isn't a defender!

10348~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> Yeah he was awesome. 

Here's another stat - 0 Goals. Again.

10349~~~
I was saying i won't want him to do well if he Joins a direct rival.

There is a outside shot of him coming good, i guess.

10350~~~
He did better than the guy who replaces him, and there's more to the game than that one stat. He did OK today, deserved to stay on.

10351~~~
He did nothing really. Knocked off the ball like a big girls blouse. Never looked a threat.

You think we should keep him then?

10352~~~
That was what was the story from the beginning - the loan deal only being put in place for FFP purposes to satisfy Moncao's financial needs - and with him playing in the last few weeks despite being woefully out of form I'd assumed the initial story was true, but with him waving to the crowd today it seems pretty clear he's gone. Shame.

10353~~~
Shame if it's true. We'll see.

10354~~~
Can't argue with this.

10355~~~
You cant fault his effort, he's just been shit all season.

10356~~~
No.

10357~~~
had a hat trick in the first half , got fouled , fouled someone and was offside.

10358~~~
He does a good job bustling about for twenty minutes, then goes missing. Wish him well, but we can't afford to be paying this much for one third of Ji Sung Park.

10359~~~
Sadly after his injury he's a poor mans Tevez. Now there was a player we should have signed after a loan deal. For one City would have at least one less PL trophy.

10360~~~
I can't help but remember those videos that came out when he first came, the looks in awe around the stadium and locker room. How he said he wanted to be a legend for Manchester United. Such a shame, good luck Radamel Fallcao, I hope you live a happy life.

10361~~~
Sorry man, but when you playing as a lone striker, the only stat which counts is number of goals.
What we need is a selfish striker who does little for most of the game, but scores 1-2 goals every game. A finisher. If we can get that sort of player, I'd be ecstatic.

10362~~~
Question - if the injury has robbed him of some kind of pace or sring or something, what will the narrative be when he bangs in 25 goals again in his career? rehabilitation with an amazing doctor?

10363~~~
He's so embarrassingly bad these days, I actually feel sorry for him. He barely even resembles a footballer. He basically runs around a lot, falls over a lot, loses the ball a lot, then gets subbed looking absolutely knackered.

 Good luck to him and all that jazz, but I hope we never see him at Old Trafford again. He's been Torres'd more then Torres was.

10364~~~
You want a striker who scores 1-2 goals each game? What tree do they grow on?

10365~~~
What a bloody disappointment he's been. He's seemed like he's really wanted to be here (who wouldn't for 250k + a week) and by all accounts is  a sound human being, but jesus wept this has been a proper fall from grace.

10366~~~
Even you would play better than him.

10367~~~
I honestly think you could pick out a Championship striker, put him in our team, and they'd play better. He's just been so comically bad. Poor sod.

10368~~~
I've wanted him gone since two/three months ago, but seeing him wave goodbye, remembering how happy he seemed when he arrived and remembering him work hard on the pitch and putting in the effort makes me kind of sad it didn't work out. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10369~~~
That was sad. Good luck to him, not his fault he got a serious injury in the best years of his career.

10370~~~
When you put it like that, it sounds similar to a lost love that didn't work. It is sad.

10371~~~
If we sign him, I hope we pay him enough to buy a decent pair of boots.  Jesus Christ, some of that slippage was in Stevie territory.

10372~~~
He's like the guy from that horrible Dane Cook movie, Good luck Chuck. If a team wants to get into the champions league, just loan him for a season and you'll be in.

10373~~~
Was nice of him to wave and clap the fans, because they have supported him (the ones at the stadium I mean). I am glad he is going, but he did at least try. Unlike RvP who did't look arsed.

Goodbye Falcao. I doubt we'll ever see a player who struggles so badly to stay upright.

10374~~~
shame things just didn't work out. he is a nice lad and i'm sure work very hard to get to the level he used to.

good luck and hope he gets a decent club elsewhere. hope it is not going to be liverpool. (look at post 10365) by <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/wednesday-at-stoke.85284/">Wednesday at Stoke</a>

10375~~~
Feels like when Torres lost that burst after his injuries at Liverpool. Hope I'm wrong but don't think it will come back. Hopefully he can get his confidence back and change his game.

10376~~~
Am I the only one who thinks taking Falcao off was one of the reasons we starting to lose a grip on the game?

Yes on the ball he was very sloppy/slippy but he was putting in a great shift, running the channels and not giving Mertesacker/Koscielny any time to get settled. RVP came on and doesn't have the legs to do that and spent most of the last half an hour jogging.

I like Falcao's attitude but its sad seeing him lacking in quality so badly.

10377~~~

10378~~~
Depressing reading the first few pages of this thread to see what eventually happened.

10379~~~
Am i the only one who thinks the addition of depay, and playing with an improved and confident di maria could resurrect falcao's career? some more incisive and direct wingplay and the goal threat our wingers will have might just give falcao the space and freedom to start scoring again.  Money issues aside,  i refuse to believe he's completely finished. I know he's most likely leaving, but I'd be pissed if he started showing his goal scoring prowess again at another club like tevez has done even to this day

10380~~~
Fernando Torres mk2. Everyone think's he'll eventually come good, but he won't.

10381~~~
I thought it was the header at Villa that was going to be the start of it.  Then the goal at stoke.  He blade 4 on the bounce over Xmas and was starting to look like he was coming good.  Then he was bobmed out for a month.

10382~~~
a lambo with no engine.

10383~~~
And no tread on the tires.

10384~~~
i saw , they turned the traction contol off.

10385~~~
Looks pretty parked in front of your house regardless.

10386~~~
No it was a coincidence. It was them taking Cazorla off and putting Ramsey back into midfield that turned the game.

10387~~~
The thread title is a bit disrespectful. He is still a United player, leave the digs to the rivals, and maybe show some respect specially to someone who has shown nothing but love and respect for the club.

10388~~~
It's not just Falcao that's had it by the way. Earlier in the season Young's was '14/15 Aquatic Diving Championship Performance' and Valencia's was just "14/15 Performance'.

10389~~~
I'm just glad he got a good reception at OT because if he read the Caf he would of retired in November <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

10390~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10391~~~
Yeah, he's peed me off when he's played awful. However, I did feel sorry for him going off yesterday. You can see he tries, but he's just not upto it any longer. The loan just didn't work out, unfortunately.

10392~~~
As said in other threads, when you have a front line of Rooney, RVP and Falcao and none are consistently putting the ball in the net when upfront, maybe the frontline isn't the problem. Each player has exceptional ability and movement.

Pretty sure that with better service, e.g. maybe Depay, inform Di Maria, Carrikesque CM, maybe things would be resolved.

10393~~~
There's no excuse for Falcao falling over and unable to control the ball, besides himself. Take the game against West Ham away when RVP and Falcao were upfront, West Ham's strikers ran in behind whereas ours provided nothing. Falcao also missed a sitter in that game. Against City when Gary Neville analysed Aguero and RVP. Aguero made runs, RVP didn't.

I myself don't believe it's due to a lack of service. Rooney hasn't played upfront consistently so I'll reserve a bit of judgment on him. Although, he was average before his injury... maybe due to a bit of tiredness.

I honestly think Wilson would of scored more than Falcao and RVP had he been given the chances they have.

Edit: I'd rather have Hernandez back than Falcao and RVP. He actually makes runs.

10394~~~
As I said, IMO one of the reasons that contributed but there were others. Ramsey moving back was also key, he was outstanding.

10395~~~
At that time, he was actually improving and we all thought, he is going to get better and better. However, for whatever reason, he got worse as the season progressed.
If that goal scoring opportunity presented itself yesterday, he would've fallen over. If he didnt fall over, he'd have missed. If he didnt miss, it'd be offiside (I stole this line from someone else on this forum BTW).  <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

10399~~~
I just can't believe how badly it's gone for him. When he was at Atleti he was my favourite striker in the world, and those goals against Bilbao in the EL final (where he curls one from the edge of the box and the second where he Cruyff turns and leaves three for dead) are some of my favourite ever goals.

Obviously I don't want him to stay, but I don't think there's a player in the world I'd rather return to form than him. He really was a joy to watch, but I think that explosiveness that he showed at Porto and Atleti has forever gone now. He's still lethal with either foot and with his head, hopefully he'll recreate himself as an out-and-out fox-in-the-box in Italy or something.

10400~~~
I want him to stay, think of the confidence boost it would give him. But ultimately, I don't want him as much as his wage and transfer fee Suggests.

10401~~~
We should get him just to counteract Jones' dismal sex appeal. In fact I'm not even sure Falcao would do that.

10402~~~
You look back at just how important his goals were in direct relation to gaining points, as bad as he has been his goals have had a huge impact on us getting 4th.

For a loan spell, job done.

10403~~~
Does this quote from the recent interview with Smalling suggest he (Falcao) might still be here next season?

<i><b>"I think when the manager has given him a chance and he's trained well and he's stayed fit, you can see he is getting sharper and sharper and with a good pre-season he'll be firing again next season,"</b></i>

10404~~~
I want him to stay, screw logic.

10405~~~
His goals have been worth 5 points... we're 7 points ahead of Liverpool...

10406~~~
I hate admitting it, but I do too. I really like him and I'm not being sensible at all about this, but I want to give him another chance. He's trying hard and it's not working out for him.
Who's to say that he hasn't agreed another short loan with us, at a lower fee and knowing Monaco need to get rid we'll get him cheap in January if he improves. Otherwise let him go if he hasn't improved.

10407~~~
I would like to keep him til January too, depending on which striker is coming in.

10408~~~
Heh. 

I'm in the "one more chance" camp fwiw. He's been undeniably wank but there's so many examples of players taking an age to show their quality after a long stint out of the game and he's still relatively young. This will have been compounded by issues with confidence, the pressure of the loan deal and the lack of chances he's getting to score. Plus pre-season is really important. Remember how long Tevez took to get up to speed? 

You only need to compare and contrast Fletcher's recent performances for WBA with his abject displays in the beginning of the season to see there's still hope for Falcao. I don't see the harm of seeing how he looks after a full pre-season.

10409~~~
Liverpool have fizzled out due to not being able to challenge us, so his goals (like any other player at the end of the day of course) have helped us get to that position.

If I could say this like a drunk van Gaal, I think my point might get across better <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

10410~~~
This is exactly how i feel. I would be over the moon if we extended his loan til January.

10411~~~
People keep saying "give him another chance until January" why is that going to help?. Firstly Monaco more than likely won't agree on another loan deal and will want a permanent transfer - so do we take a 4 year risk on a falcao that is more than likely shot? Could you imagine how bad he could be in 4 years?. 

I don't agree that he needs a pre season, why does it being pre season make it any different than training in real life every day and actually playing matches. If he isn't match fit now he never will be!. 

I like him as a man and as a former fantastic striker, but we must be ruthless and aim for the best. Lumping 40m and 200k a year on him would be absolutely ludicrous.

10412~~~
Say, in this magical world where we keep him, and he begins firing again. By the end of next season he will be 30... (or should that be "30"?) How much more do we really expect out of him by that point? It's a complete non-starter whatever way you look at it.

10413~~~
It's probably not going to happen for him but we could probably get him cheap if we fancied giving him another shot. Otherwise Monaco have a big financial headache.

10414~~~
I agree with this 100%. Im not quite sure what magic, some fans believe occurs during pre-season.
I think some fans like the idea of having a Galactico in our team.
For me, I care little about the name. I look at the facts and the fact is that in half a season, he has managed to score 4 goals. That's an exceptionally poor return for a striker (even someone on low wages). The real kicker is that this guy is getting paid a fortune.
And lets not forget, he has already peaked, so is likely to get worse, not better.

I can only think that there are some non-Man Utd fans in here and they are joking that Falcao should stay.
Remember, last year, there were many Man City fans who said that Moyes should stay at Man Utd as they knew that he was useless. Perhaps the same applies to Falcao.

10415~~~
He is also going to be playing in the cops america so he isn't going to get the rehab, rest and proper preseason that he probably needs.

I really can't see the sense in adding another striker who is on the way down to our squad, only reason to sign falcao is if he is going to be the star player he once was and have a season similar to RVP's first season here. He looks a Million miles away from being that player and there is something wrong if we can't identify a better option.

10416~~~
At the end of the day no one knows if he will return anywhere near his pre injury form!

If we buy him it's a 50/50 risk he could start banging in 20+ goals a season or he could carry on doing a Gerrard!

10417~~~
Not saying Falcao will have a good pre-season because it will be interrupted. But anyone who doesn't think a good pre-season is important and sets you up for the season ahead has never played the game or as rocks in their head.

10418~~~
Obviously it's important but I think Falcao would have shown some improvement by now from the beginning of the season if he was ever going to be the anything like the same player. Look at Luis Suarez this year, started pretty slowly at Barcelona having had no pre-season because of that ban (and had an injury before the World Cup albeit nowhere near as bad as Falcao's) but in the last few months he's been incredible for them.

10419~~~
I hope he stays for another 6 months loan (reduced wages) with an option to buy after that.

10420~~~
pretty suprised by the amount of people who want him to stay - he's not suited to the way LvG wants to play so there is no point in keeping him around.

10421~~~
I hope he grows his hair back

10422~~~
Utd fans are an extremely forgiving bunch, the only Utd player I think absolutely everybody had given up on in the end was Anderson.

Personally I think it would be absolute madness to keep him on next season. He's been desperately poor.

10423~~~
Don't think too many tears will be shed when Tom Cleverley packs his bags in the summer. And yeah, there's no way we should have Falcao still hanging around next year, it's disappointing it's not worked out but let's move on.

10424~~~
I am not sure we know how LVG wants to play. His system was based on the players available to him. He obviously likes skilled players because he bought both Falcao and Di Maria. He met Mata here and the Herrera deal was at an advanced stage when LVG came on board. Maybe LVG's system will be different after he has made major changes, some of which may include central and attacking midfielders.
I think in a different style of play Di Maria, RVP and Falcao could still be dangerous. Before this season would anyone assume that Young, Mata and Herrera would perform better than the former three? Before this season did anyone think Rooney was a better No9 than RVP or Falcao? I do not think so for either question.
I cant wait to see what LVG has up his sleeve.

10425~~~
I think we do - towards the end of the season he stuck to the same formation that he has played with for most of his career. It is basically a 4-3-3 and it seems he wants his one striker to play a lot with the back to goal and often come deep to get involved in the build up - that does not suit Falcao, and is the also the reason Chicharito was sent out immediately.

10426~~~
It may help keep you at the top level longer into the season, less injuries perhaps but no way does a pre season make you better than your top level already is. Just look at carrick, no pre season and came back like a house on fire. Over the Christmas period falcao showed he doesn't have the legs for the premier league, and I don't think he will ever get his old ability back. If he does I will be absolutely delighted, but we've seen it too often before. Knee injuries just don't recover you the same player.

10427~~~
Shit thread title, which numpty is responsible for it?

10428~~~
Biggest indication yet possibly?

10429~~~
Of what? that he's fecking useless?

10430~~~
So his going to make a decision which he says "you have to take risks" 


Wtf does that mean?

10431~~~
Liverpool.

10432~~~
That he's cut his hair?

10433~~~
He's going to rob a board game shop.

10434~~~
At least he can say with his head held high that he did it on a cold, wet day in Stoke.

10435~~~
Valencia on Instagram saying what looks like his goodbyes to Falcao?

10436~~~
Maybe Valencia is saying his goodbyes? <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

10437~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10438~~~
Been alright so far.

10439~~~
Yeah, one of his better games for us so far. Can't remember him falling over even once.

10440~~~
Goodbye

10441~~~
Shame it didn't work out. Gutted he wasn't the player we were expecting.

10442~~~
I think hes off but if its based on what LvG said (something about how he has one more day to talk to him) then i think its off the mark

10443~~~
Falcao is gone; shame but his performance this season didn't warrant keeping him.

10444~~~
I wish him the best.  I was never happy about the loan but I hope he turns things around.

10445~~~
shame it didn't work out. good luck in the future falcao.

10446~~~
Shame it didn't work out. Seems like a good guy, but it would have been an appalling decision to keep him.

10447~~~
Still have a nagging feeling that he'll come back good in the end. Hopefully not at a Premier League club though.

10448~~~
Good luck wherever he goes, gave his all but just lost a lot of what made him good before. This was always going to be a recovery season from him

10449~~~
Shame it didn't work out. Hope it works out for him at his next club (not in the EPL).

10450~~~
Wanted it to work. Sad that he didn't, but wish him well as long as he doesn't join another premier league club.

10451~~~
Thank feck for that. He was one of the worst strikers to ever play in the League. Looked like an amateur most of the time.

10452~~~
I was really excited when we signed him, but it became evident early that he was nowhere near his top level. The whole season just seemed like him trying to regain his match fitness without it ever really happening.

Glad he's gone. Wish him luck in the future.

10453~~~
No surprises. Had the slightest worry that there was some permanent deal in place at one point, but glad to see him go. Just a gamble that didn't work out.

Good luck to him, always had a great attitude at the club.

10454~~~
One of the most disappointing signings in our history, expected so much but he delivered so little. Glad it was only a loan.

10455~~~
Seems like a really nice and sympathetic guy. I wish it had worked out for him here, too bad it didn't. Good luck to him wherever he goes, I hope he still manages to pick his career up somewhere else.

10456~~~
He should probably just retire. His legs look like they've completely gone.

10457~~~
Worth a punt but the right decision to move on.

10458~~~
It's obviously a shame that it didn't work out, but I don't have regrets that we took him when we did. 

It'll be interesting to see where he ends up. Surely La Liga will be the place, can't see any PL club taking the risk even if he significantly reduces his wage demands.

10459~~~
To bad it did not work but for some reason i still believe that he will turn good next season for some other club and show that he is not shit like some here painted him.

10460~~~
Serie A is the place for him to go

Peace Falcao.

10461~~~
I really thought he'd be great in the PL. But didn't realize how much he'd regressed since his injury.

10462~~~
Even if he comes good elsewhere its still the right decision for us, we don't need to take the gamble for another season when we have a whole summer to find someone better suited.

Good luck to him.

10463~~~
no room for sentimentality in this game. Nothing less than awful this season, all he did was hinder the chances of some of our younger striker.

10464~~~
All things considered he was absolutely horrific. 

One of the worst strikers I've seen play for us in my lifetime.

10465~~~
Year ago we could easily say he was the best #9 in Europe in the last five years or so, terrific player. 

But his poor record (only 4 goals in ~30apps) is speaking for itself, he was really shocking at times.

Good luck, El Tigre!

10466~~~
I, for one, am shocked by this decision. 
really though, was desperate for him to regain his confidence in front of goal but it wasn't to be. Good luck to him wherever he goes, very professional attitude despite a very difficult season.

10467~~~
Correct. Don't ever think he'll be the same player though.

10468~~~
Quite relieved by the news tbh.

10469~~~
Good. No way is he up to this league after that injury. No pace and no strength. It was like playing against a child for Prem CB's.

10470~~~
If we ignore the fact he's been gash this season, we've clearly needed a fast, mobile striker (even obvious under Moyes) which Falcao is not. Doesn't make any sense in signing a 29 year old, who's just back from a major injury on massive wages for a big fat fee. Especially when we have two other strikers of the same mould of the same age profile.

10471~~~
An exciting gamble and a rare money-conserving move by Woodward to set it up as a loan/option. Still bewildered he saw gametime for months after his deficiencies were obvious.

Over/under on the "Falcao Goals 2014-15" youtube clip - 90 seconds?

10472~~~
I think the Falcao deal was all about keeping mendes sweet.

10473~~~
There is a lot of sub appearances in those 29 he made for us and it's a season where Rooney and RVP have both also fallen well short of the number of goals they are capable of as well.  We struggled for too long in the season as a team while he at the same time was trying to overcome injury and prove himself so the circumstances weren't right for him. The best run he got was when Carrick was injured and Mata and Herrera were warming the bench, not ideal. I think he'll do much better at his next club and good luck to him.

10474~~~
Bebe had a better strike rate

Goodbye

10475~~~
Squeeze out two and half minutes if every goal is super slow mo and from every possible angle.

10476~~~
Unlucky marriage. Can not afford a 'will he ever come back' type of striker in the objectives we will set for next season. If we ought to go for a striker i hope for a cheeky bid on Jackson Martinez.

10477~~~
17 games where he has played more than 45 mins (a lot of them seem to be around 70 min mark)

10478~~~
100%. You can guarantee, if he completes stage 2 of the Tevez template in a similar fashion, the sort of comments we'd see on here and elsewhere, but signing him for the money being talked about would be based on nothing but blind faith that he'll come good.

10479~~~
This.

As I've said many times over the season, he needs to be in a slower, less frenetic league where he has that millisecond longer to move/shoot.

Serie A would be a good place for him to get a couple if decent seasons under his belt.

Wish him the best, and I hope that Mendes (and Falcao himself) are sensible in their next move, and have learned from this rushed through loan move.

10480~~~
Best of luck to Falcao. Would have loved to see him succeed here.

Needs to go back to Spain (or Italy) where he will have more time on the ball.

10481~~~
It's great news he won't be coming back, even another loan deal would have been a bad idea. Not only has he been awful and still not recovered from his injury but we need pace/skill/strength/mobility up front and he offers none of that. With Rooney and RVP no longer at their best last thing we need is another striker on the way down.

10482~~~
Too bad it wasnt meant to be. Good luck to him. 
I think Roma should go for him.

10483~~~
I really liked El Tigre, wanted him to succeed here. I guess we signed him at the wrong time, we totally missed the boat on this one.

10484~~~
Co-signed, Serie A is the right league for him and RvP at this juncture IMO.

10485~~~
Yeah, Roma needs a proper striker among other things, Serie A is less paced, you have more time of the ball, I think he could shine there. 
Hell, even Gervinho has been good in his first season.

10486~~~
I think he could find some form at Roma, he'd be the undisputed first choice with good pace either side of him and a strong midfield trio behind him.

10487~~~
Shadow of his former self. Injury seems to have ruined his career. 

A sympathetic 5/10. In reality it could be as low as 3/10

10488~~~
He should go to US or some rich Arab league for a final pay-cheque

10489~~~
I'm devastated...

10490~~~
Great news.I mean i'm gutted.

10491~~~
If nothing else Falcao has given us this to remember him by:

10492~~~
Should have bought him from Athletico. Wasn't there a rumour at the time that we'd made a bid for him but he picked Monaco for the amount of money on offer rather than any realistic chance for honours. It's water under the bridge now but I'm sorry it didn't work out for him. Seems like a decent and likeable person.

10493~~~
Goodbye falcao, it was short and not very sweet. Glad to see you played for us though.

10494~~~
Goodbye, sweet prince. Lololololololo.

10495~~~
I'm sure it's been said before but we all know he'll be banging them in for fun at another PL team next season, right? I mean, it's inevitable. 

Probably the right decision but I'm almost certain this will be yet another of the many post-Fergie ball-aches we're going to have to endure. Bah humbug.

10496~~~
No, no he won't. You don't just improve suddenly over night after a season of shite!

10497~~~
Leaving.

Officially confirmed by the club.

10498~~~
Laters Falcao.

10499~~~
Shame it didn't work out. I'm sure Sky commentators and pundits will have a field day saying about how we must regret letting him go once he smashes in goals against the likes of Empoli and Sassuolo next season...

10500~~~
He wont be banging them in for any premier league club. Hes not good enough to play in this league.

10501~~~
I hope he doesn't go to another Prem team because you just know it will bite us in our arse.

10502~~~
Good luck where ever he ends up. It didn't work out but that was more down to timing that actual ability.

10503~~~
Thank God, he was embarrasing as a player for us but he seems a very good person, hope he goes to the Serie A to start over again.

10504~~~
Quite relieved that the rumours we had bought him were not true. Hope he does well in another league.

10505~~~
Given the fees, wages and reputation, this has to go down as the biggest flop in PL history.
I thought we had struck gold when we got ADM and him. Complete opposite in hindsight.

10506~~~
Shame it didn't work out, but he had to go. A few of those reports saying we would sign him regardless nearly had me worried...

Now lets just hope we've not pissed off Mendes <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

10507~~~
Cheerio, cheerio, bye bye
Cheerio, it's too late to try
'Cause I miss you, every morning and I need you every night
Cheerio, cheerio, bye bye

Cheerio, cheerio, bye bye
And I will never know the reason why
For a moment we were lovers and for a moment you were mine
And now it's over, Cheerio, bye bye

We were running wild
A miss forgotten child
I saw you on the roof top
You're eyes were shining bright
Like a candle in the night

Was it only a game you played for fun?
Did you think you could fly?
Just a memory remains as time goes by

Cheerio, cheerio, bye bye
Cheerio, it's too late to try
There is nothing to forgive you
By what is wrong or what is right
Cheerio, cheerio, bye bye

10508~~~
LO LO LO LO LO LO LO!

10509~~~
feck me I wouldn't mind trying one of these pre-seasons if they're that good. Might turn me into a PL footballer.

10510~~~
Farewell Handsome Tevez.

10511~~~
Thank god for that!

10512~~~
What is he on about ? Did he not have a pre-season with Monaco ? I swear he scored in the Emirates cup

10513~~~
Going to miss that chant.

10514~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10515~~~
I am a bit sad about it. He was shite, but his potential always made me believe he deserved another half year loan with a full pre season to show if he really would cut it. At the end it was probably the right decision, but i liked him, at elast he put the effort in.

I never thought he was such a passionate and likeable guy, always thought he didnt care much for other things and lived a typical footballers life.

10516~~~
Inabit

10517~~~
Shame it didn't work out for the player and the club. Under Sir Alex things might have been different. Hopefully he remembers his time at Old Trafford fondly.

10518~~~
We don't loan well

10519~~~
Good. Now, let's never mention him again and allow this thread to fade away.

Seems like a great guy but it wasn't to be. Even if you want to give him a second chance, at that salary and transfer cost there is no way.

10520~~~
Sad, He will probably get signed by chelsea for 10m and score a goal a game s cover for costa. cnuts.

10521~~~
Larsson is the only one I can remember working out, sure I'll be proved wrong though.

Not sure you can compare fitness for the French league to the English Premiership. Just saying that, you can not rest in any game in England. Also, it's better to have a pre season with the players you are going to be playing with during the season. It seems to me, in his pomp he thrived on crosses. I think his confidence was low and it could be that he may have improved, but our service out wide is poor currently. We have to improve in that aspect of our play. In the early part of the season, we were dog shite struggling with the formation and injury. We created very little at times.

10523~~~
Shame it didn't work originally but this is the right decision and it's been obvious that it is the correct decision for a long time now. Was concerned for a while that we might still have bought him for a reduced fee, so this is a relief. Was definitely worth the risk last summer though, unfortunately he just wasn't the same.

10524~~~
Were there any particular Falcao highlights? 

I'm struggling to remember one of the 4 goals he scored, so I think my standout Falcao highlight is that time he forgot how to read numbers.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-CLvGDCIAAI4-h.png" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B-CLvGDCIAAI4-h.png"/>

10525~~~
First thing he should do is beg Simeone to take him back.

Other than that I have a feeling he could end up at Arsenal. Wenger's given many of his own players time to prove themselves and this is a guy who is proven but needs some patience and nurturing to get back. Given Wenger's attitude to allow full recovery times, at times delaying player comebacks to long I can imagine that he had some foresight that this move to United wouldn't pan out well. At reduced cost he could benefit from all this.

10526~~~
5.4 Average rating
5.8 Your rating

I Wish him the best. Hopefully a long career still ahead and many more goals.

Too bad it didn't work, but we all know how difficult is to come back from this injuries. It was really a matter of  bad timing. A few years earlier, what could have been...

Anyway, thx for showing the courage to want to play for us. I'm sure you did your best Tiger.

10527~~~
The United website acted very fast in removing him from the squad page - so we're back to having no number 9 as we were after Berba left. Factor in Saha and the number really hasn't had much luck recently.

I'm gutted it hasn't worked-out. Everything seemed wrong - as bad as his performances were overall, I can't see the LVG formation and style of player working for a player like him. I wish him nothing but the best, though I hope he doesn't try to move to another Premier League side, for our sake and his.

10528~~~
It's been too long since we had a top class player in the #9 shirt.

10529~~~
Shame, but the right decision. Considering Monaco are in the CL, I wonder if he'll stay there?

10530~~~
Shame it didnt work out but I think we have known that for a while now that it wasnt going to work.
Good luck to him.

10531~~~
Van Gaal: "Falcao is a top professional & a good human being. On behalf of everyone at <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mufc?src=hash" target="_blank">#mufc</a>, I would like to wish him well for the future".

10532~~~
When was our last great #9? Cole?

10533~~~
<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

I'll miss him. Can't believe Radamel Falcao played for us and it didn't work out.

10534~~~
Yeah, Cole. Since then we've had Saha, Berbatov and Falcao.

10535~~~
I still remember the night before deadline day when rumours were going round about Falcao to City and how we all had a meltdown here 

<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10536~~~
Great player. Wrong club. Good luck to him. He gave 100% but it wasn't to be. No doubt he'll continue a great career bext season. 

Was at OTfor one of his goals, pleased to have seen him celebrate with us!

10537~~~
Good decision. A shame it didn't work out but he's just not up for it anymore.

10538~~~
Wish he stayed.

10539~~~
Just glad we dont seem to have had to pay anything to get out of signing him. His agent made it seem like we had already agreed to take him

10540~~~
Best of luck to him, seemed like a decent bloke, pity things did not work out. Hopefully he regains his old form at his next club.

10541~~~
That's because we've consistently signed 9s who are either old, immobile or injury prone.

In Falcao we managed to tick literally all three of these boxes - a somewhat impressive achievement for a club that has basically no financial limits.

10542~~~
It was a risk worth taking to bring him in, but it hasn't worked out. It's clearly the right decision to move him on. Hopefully he will find some form elsewhere, but I doubt it will be in the Premier League.

10543~~~
Great lad just didnt work out for him..shame.

10544~~~
Sad it didn't work out for him, wish him luck in the future (except against us!).

10545~~~
Only logical option.

Nice guy but he won't get the big move he wants, not a chance any side will fork out enough money for him. Unless he gets another loan move.

He should forget about titles and just go enjoy himself in the MLS.

10546~~~
Why would United be the wrong club for him? he just wasn't good enough, it had nothing to do with being at the wrong club.

10547~~~
Good. He can take his past it, greasy, shifty, dodgy car salesman looking self back to France.

10548~~~
Saha was class when fit and Berba was good.

10549~~~
Wouldn't be at all surprised if a fresh start at a new club kicks his form back to life but really we had to let him go given how poor he's been here.

10550~~~
Good luck to him.

10551~~~
I can still remember the hype and excitement the transfer created. We probably didn't need him but we were getting a player with a world class reputation. Such a shame it didn't work out here. He looked physically shot and we just couldn't justify giving him the run of games he might have needed, maybe a good pre-season might have improved him. Best of luck to him anyway and thanks for his hard work.

10552~~~
Happy days , had his chance and never took it.
Hope he finds his form at what ever club he goes too .

10553~~~
He tried his best but unfortunately his best for whatever reason just wasn't good enough for Utd or the PL even, this season. Things might have been different if we got our hands on him a few years ago.

10554~~~
Both were good players, I wouldn't say they were great though. Cole is/will be remembered as one I think, being part of the treble team helps as well.

10555~~~
If you'd have told me 3 years ago Falcao would be a United players I'd have done myself a mischief.

Alas...

Can't fault his effort when he played but that injury has ruined him and he was trying to play in the same manner as he did before it happened. He needs to play in league where the pace is a bit slower and reinvent himself as a player - if he can do that he'll get back to banging the goals in.

Good luck to him.

10556~~~
I don't wish him anything but the best of luck for the future but I'm sure I'll forget he ever played for us before too long.

What a forgettable season he's had.

10557~~~
Didn't realise he's played more games for us now than Monaco.

10558~~~
I remember feeling genuinely jealous when you guys first signed him. We'd wanted him desperately for years when he was in his "prime." Before we saw what Costa could do in the PL and after his awful World Cup I feared you guys had got the better deal.

Crazy to think that just a couple of seasons ago Falcao and RvP were the two best strikers in the world. Now they're both injured, borderline wash-ups.

10559~~~
Good luck to him, i'm glad we didn't sign him on another loan deal.

10560~~~
It just didn't work out. don't be a prat about it and try to have some class. There are plenty of players who struggle at one club and succeed at others. Look at Forlan asone of many, many examples. His return from a very serious injury didn't help either did it? I wish him all the success he could have in the future. If he plays us i hope he gets a great reception and has a stinker.

10561~~~
I really don't think it helped how poor we have been at creating chances this season. He, Rooney and RVP are all capable of scoring far more goals, they've all had dissapointing seasons in that regard.

What bothers me most is that he seems like the kind of player who would flourish under Fergie, whereas LVG's possession based philosophy probably suits someone like Berbatov, who relies on intelligence and positioning rather than speed and power.

10565~~~

10569~~~
Well, I guess this thread needs to go back to the "Football Forums"..

Feel sad it didn't work out for him/us <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10570~~~
Well, that was awkward.

10571~~~
I'd feel sad for him but then he got a hottie for a wife and will 18 million euros a year while living it up in Monaco. Well, you atleast tried Falcao!

10572~~~
I know. Bring back Coley!

10573~~~
So disappointing that we never got to see the best of him. Hopefully he can get it back in the future, good luck to him.

10574~~~
Anyone else feeling relieved? 

I'll admit, a little part of me did worry that we might go for him at a discounted price.

10575~~~
It feels like a cameo season, like when we signed Henrik Larsson.

Hope he manages to smash in the goals for a (non-PL) team where he can prosper.

10576~~~
Aye

10577~~~
I'm not sure about smashing in goals but I think he'll do very well somewhere. His play (though not his goalscoring) was impressive at the beggining for us.

10578~~~
Except Larsson did infinitely more in 10 weeks than Falcao did in a season. 

Still, best of luck to him. Even though it wasn't happening for him he always gave 100%, which you couldn't say for some players recently.

10579~~~
Yeah. All those great deals Mendes has gotten us. Hate to miss out on that.

10580~~~
Shame for both parties that this move never got anywhere near to delivering what we hoped it would on deadline day. Jeez that day seems so long ago now. I wouldn't be surprised if he restored his reputation with another club, but I'm not too worried about it being at another PL club - he just doesn't seem suited to this league. It happens. Best that we're moving on without him.

10581~~~
Don't think there's anyone who didn't want him to succeed. If we had kept him his performances this season would have been like a noose around his neck. Better off he has a fresh start somewhere else.

I'm pretty sure we'll still sing his name, which is kinda weird.

10582~~~
Getting us an absolute worldie keeper for pennies on the dollar.


Oh wait, that's Madrid.

10583~~~
looks like uncle Louis wont be strongarmed by anyone

10584~~~
I still remember the deadline day excitement when the rumours about him joining United were commencing.

10585~~~
Saying he wasn't good enough doesn't make me a prat. He wasn't good enough and at his current level I could even see him struggling in the championship, never mind at United. Obviously he was a fantastic striker at one point, but going by his time at United, it's a fair claim to make.

I do wish him well though and hope he manages gets back to his best wherever he ends up.

10586~~~
Realistically, could he go back to Porto? Jackson Martinez is leaving isn't he?

<a class="username" data-user="42612, @Arruda" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/42612/">@Arruda</a>

10587~~~
such a shame we got him in this condition, would have loved to see him here at his peak. amazing player at one point. wish him the best whereever he goes next year. hope he finds some form again

10588~~~
This summer would have been the perfect time to take the risk of signing Falcao on loan not last summer.

10589~~~
Biggest disappointment as a United fan in recent memory is him not working out. I thought we were getting a world class #9.

10590~~~
Good luck to him, (unless he signs for a rival, lol)

Glad I got to sing his song though :P Its a shame, I think he tried to rush back to quickly for the World Cup and it affected him long term. Trying to return from the injury after 5 months wasnt best advised. Still, he had some moments early on (few assists and goals) but then it just didnt work out for him.

10591~~~
Absolutely gutted it didn't work out. We had Radamel Falcao playing for us...and it really didn't work. Grim!

10592~~~
Really hope he doesn't join another PL club, would hate to see him score for Chelsea or Arsenal or someone

10593~~~
Worse than finishing 7th?!

10594~~~
I am.

10595~~~
If he joined our side when we weren't tinkering so much, I'd say it would have gone better for him. Alas it wasn't to be. Falcao in a Fergie side would have been a scary sight.

Hope it goes well for him. A very, very likable guy.

10596~~~
I feel just as bad for the ADM deal, he doesnt seem to be working out either.

10597~~~
Looking at it from a different angle, summising his performances alone, say... If his name wasn't Falcao, and us not having known anything about his prior goalscoring history, instead... just some guy we'd  plucked from elsewhere and he'd performed similar this season well... we'd all be throwing tomatoes at him by now.

He seems a lovely chap off the pitch, I wish him well, but I'm not sad he's off and I dont think i'd particuarly care if he joined a rival at this point, he looks to have serious issues with basic balance, perhaps he rushed back from his knee injury too quickly to try and make the world cup squad and is suffering longterm side effects, but I speculate at this point.

10598~~~
Glad that this decision has been made.

10599~~~
I'm just relieved that the initial rumor of the deal being permanent masked via loan to comply with FFP wasn't true.

10600~~~
Yeah shame. Would have loved for it to have worked. Seems a top bloke. I do reckon, like most that he will smash it in Italy next year.

10601~~~
Anyone think it's telling that all of our strikers under performed this season? Is that more to to do with our strikers or the team? Is it a big coincidence?

10602~~~
Such a shame this didn't work out. Seems like a nice guy too. I was so excited when he signed.  Worth the gamble at the time for sure. Onwards and upwards though.

10603~~~
Sorry to see him go, can only assume that means we have a striker lined up because the others have performed no better and are not the solution.

10604~~~
Never really looked good enough. Showed the odd glimpse but he was getting bounced around by defenders and couldn't control a ball. Some players do need a full pre season etc to get over an injury, falcao just doesn't suit this league unfortunately. He still won us 8 points though.

10605~~~
Wanted to give him time and as sad as I am to see him leave, it is surely the right decision. Football just has a way of not always going to plan. I truly wish him well and hope to see him banging goals in for another club (not in the EPL).

10606~~~
Diego Forlan at least had his moments of brilliance. Falcao simply looked forlorn in a United shirt.

I wish him the best and hope to see him firing on all cylinders in the future.

10607~~~
The slow turgid play didn't help but surely the injury problems all had was a bigger issue. I do wonder if Benteke could be another Yorke, but more of beast for us.

10608~~~
I remember the excitement when the news broke of us signing him even though most felt we didn't need another striker. Then on deadline day it took ages for him to get cleared and the rumours swirled that he'd failed the medical as we got two extensions to register him, the Caf was buzzing. Sadly it didn't work out for him here but I hope he does well in Italy or maybe even back in Portugal.

Farewell Raddy Falcers, you were not the Salas/Batistuta dream finally realized but no one rocks the long haired headband combo quite like you sir.

10609~~~
He got f*ck all service, dont remember him missing many chances that others would have nailed. A class player that was hard done by, hopefully we can cut a deal to bring him back.

10610~~~
Sad to see him go but its the right decision considering the money involved. No striker would have shone this season with the lack of chances we have created.

10611~~~
Thank feck for the news. It's obvious he doesn't cut it in this league and our style. Not good enough as starter, and was even useless as sub-impact. 

Seems like a nice guy, though.

10612~~~
A part of me still hopes we return and sign him for a much more reasonable fee and wages.  He'll always have a soft spot in my heart.  I'll be absolutely gutted if Mendes manages to flog him to Liverpool, and even more so if he comes good next season.

10613~~~
A striker needs to be able to create space for himself so others can find him. Falcao was too slow and weak, both on and off the ball, to give any Premiership defender worth his salt much to worry about.

10614~~~
Falcao (like Torres) seemed to lose both his first touch and initial burst of acceleration. He isn't the Same player he once was.He might make it in another league but the EPL isn't for him at this juncture.

10615~~~
When he arrived at the club we were playing the most dull football ever. Defenders kicked 7 shades of sh*t out of Falcao cos they needed to stop him. At United he worked his ass off, and his off the ball play improved, a much more complete player now. 

He will do well wherever he ends up.

10616~~~
Great guy off the field but we are not paying him for that. Feel bad but all the best for him.

10617~~~
I think he was a name signed without paying the transfer fee, to show the fans that the Glazers Woddy and Co meant business, a smart move by them. In the early part of the season, we simply were not creating chances. He cant score if we aint doing much. 

With a player like him, a team needs to be setup to play to his strengths. We have many top strikers so he needs to fit into a system, a philosophy even, he just did not fit in. Time will tell if others can.

10618~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> he didnt get much service, no one did, but he still managed to look awful and no better than Wilson who isn't ready for the PL yet, I may have liked the guy and even felt for him, but the man could barely stay on his feet most game, he's a big lad who gets pushed off the ball, lack of confidence and slow, clearly not a top striker anymore.

10619~~~
Show us some youtube clips then. We were awful at the start of the season, he was injured for a while. DiMaria got suspended at the same time as RVP got injured and we then got the results that glossed over a very average campaign.

10620~~~
I think you're one of the few people who think he improved sthing, anything this year. 

Sure we weren't creating much but he barely created sthing for himself, not to mention his lack of runs behind defenses and inability to stay on the feet.

10621~~~
Right decision, too much of a gamble to spend that much on someone who hasn't proven himself worth half of that during his year here.

Ultimately I'm glad we tried. It was risky, but it could have paid off. Shame it didn't, but I'd do it again.

10622~~~
I think Serie A would fit for him.

10623~~~
One of the best strikers in Europe before his injuries, his spell at United couldn't have gone much worse. You have to feel for him. "He was crap but is a really nice guy". He's fallen so far that he's turned into David Moyes.

10624~~~
Shame it didn't work out but with the money involved we did the right thing.

10625~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/oEB6v7q.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/oEB6v7q.png"/>

10626~~~
Just relieved it was only a loan deal. If we had been obligated to sign him for the agreed fee and his current wages it would have been an absolute disaster. He's been a complete shambles pretty much all season.

10627~~~
He was rubbish and he's gone but god damn it you can't be mad/hate the guy. Classy character.

10628~~~
Great effort. Thanks for your efforts in getting us back to top four!

10629~~~
Which team? I don't think he's good enough for Juve.

10630~~~
Didn't happen, but the guy never hid, and he always appeared to try his best for us, even if it wasn't up to much sometimes, so can't fault him really. I'm sorry to see him go, I still think with a summer rest and solid pre-season, he'll be banging goals in wherever he ends up. Not sure he will ever be what he was, but he will be a good striker again.

10631~~~
I still think he's a good striker and he'll be back on form for his new club. Clearly it didn't work out for him here, which is a shame, but his attitude and work rate was top class all season.

10632~~~
Probably one of the worst signings I have seen which is very sad to say. Hope he recovers his old form at his next club but definitely a signing which in a few years time we will laugh about and think what the feck was that about.

10633~~~
It's a shame but truthfully he's far from the player he used to be. Hope he does well in another league.

10634~~~
I thought it was a wrong buy in the first place. Because he's overestimated, he still had to make it into world class instead of Porto, AM and Monaco which are not. If you watch an in form striker in a super cup and lots of his goals on YT it's easy to be impressed, but his first touch has never been solid and it's never been much else but a finisher. Therefore as a type of striker he'd never fit in perfectly, and on class it also was a bit iffy, and then there was the injury and the fact that the EPL has different demands,  it could have worked out but it was very unlikely to begin with.

But even in the most difficult spells for him, he didn't hide but kept doing the things he should be good at. So I hope he finds a nice club, and ends up like a Forlan or Battistuta or something.

10635~~~
Hard luck. I hope things turn out for him. (unless it's with Liverpool)

10636~~~
Classy guy. Best of luck to him. Brilliant chant <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

10637~~~
Its been a rough year for him and theres no doubt that any new club he goes to next will likely ask him to take a severe paycut.

10638~~~
Or Chelsea,Arsenal and City.

10639~~~
He is, but I doubt Falcao could be an option to replace him. We could never afford his ages, even if he cut them in half. Either way, I wouldn't trust him enough by now.

10640~~~
Number 7 not so great either...Owen, Valencia and Di Maria

10641~~~
Can't fault his effort, even when he played for the u21's he gave it everything which as commendable as it was only highlighted how much he has declined because no matter how hard he tried he was still useless. Hopefully he has the sense to go to Italy or Spain because he might salvage his career there, physically he has declined to much to succeed in the premier league.

10642~~~

10643~~~
I dont feel the need to commend his effort, he was getting paid shit loads, nice guy, but not at the level we need

10644~~~
I don't think he's ever gonna be the player that he was but good luck to him.

Can we keep the song though?

10645~~~

10648~~~
Always struck me as a proper gent and a true professional. Its a pity it didnt work for him here, but I am just glad we evidently didnt have some pre-agreement to sign him.

10649~~~
Must have been a great guy off the pitch as I barely remember him and Januzaj on the pitch together

10650~~~
He reminds me of Forlan. Great player but it just didn't work out.

10651~~~
He was a nice guy and worked hard but it was obvious as feck from the very begining to anyone with a brain that a 28 year old moving to a new league after a massive knee injury was going to be another Shevchenko.

10652~~~
… and then of course we have all this to come:

I could score 10 goals a season with Fabregas' through balls.

Mendes: (tumbleweed)

10658~~~
Really popular with our players it seems, great guy. 

Leave the Premier League Falcao, go South and you will find a decent form again.

10659~~~
It's a real shame this move didn't work out for Falcao, although obviously we don't know what goes on behind closed doors, the impression I get is much the same as the rest of you, just seems like a nice fella.
None of the ego which is so public with most of the top players.  A very dignified spell at OT (especially as I assume he would have expected to start virtually every game when he signed).  And a very dignified exit too, I would like to wish him the best wherever he ends up next!

10660~~~
It's not fair, we get a real gent at the club but due to his injuries he couldn't replicate his form with us. Just watch him get back to his best. He's going to be great, and it won't be with us.

10661~~~
He and his agent are ambitious .I give them that

10662~~~
I can't understand why people keep saying he's going to get back to his best next season and we'll look daft for not signing him. There is no chance he'll ever get back to his best.

Now he might be better than he has been this year with a full pre season behind him, but it'd be hard for him to be any worse.

10663~~~
Yeah I don't get it, he was dreadful when he was here and showed no signs he'll get close to his best, that injury really fecked him up.

Glad he's gone was a waste of space really, I was worried we'd sign him permanently.

The "he gave his all" Stuff always makes me laugh to, I'd try hard if I was getting £250,000 per week as well, doesn't mean I'm any good.

10664~~~
reading reports he was no is desperate to join Chelsea , would they even consider him ?

10665~~~
As a reply to Young saying he enjoyed playing with Falcao. Such a shame it didn't work out. Incredibly easy to like him.

10666~~~
Can't see it. Costa is far better than he is now and Remy is better currently as well. Even with the large pay cut that's being talked about he'd probably be on higher wages than most of our players. Too high for a squad player.

Don't see why Falcao himself would want to be our 3rd choice striker.

10667~~~
just my thoughts , he could go to quite a few teams and be a decent addition to their squad , why play 3 fiddle at Chelsea.

10668~~~
Now this to Januzaj <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10669~~~

10670~~~
Hopefully not, Even  a 37 year old Drogba was better this season. Also if we did and he somehow become good, I would probably get banned on here for being a wum!

10671~~~
No way IMO.  Mourinho already carried Torres, Costa has injury problems, and he will be in no mood to have another crock recovery on the squad.  If any of the better clubs were to take him, it would be Liverpool.

10672~~~
Falcao is clearly a nice bloke.

10673~~~
Admittedly he was pretty awful for us, but I don't see how any red can not love this guy. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10674~~~
I'd be gutted if he went to Chelsea, I know he looked like a completely different player for us but it would be no surprise if he returned to his world class form from before the injury and scored enough goals to help them win the league. One of my best mates is a Chelsea fan and I don't think I'd hear the end of it considering my excitement at us bringing him in on loan, still can't believe it went tits up.

10675~~~
Milan could do worse than take a punt of him.

10676~~~
Or bring in Benzema.

10677~~~
To see Falcao at Chelsea, would be a dream come true.
Torres prevented Chelsea winning the title while he was them and I'm sure that Falcao can do a similar job for Chelsea.
If we are to win the title in the next 2 years, we need all the help we can get and Falcao could be instrumental in degrading Chelsea.

10678~~~
I remember the excitement pre season, and the feeling at QPR willing him to come on and score.

Unfortunately it quickly dawned on us all that it wasn't working, especially not with 2 up front and Rooney behind. Would it have worked any better with Falcao as the lone front man? Probably not to be fair.

Thank goodness we didn't lash a huge transfer fee out.

10679~~~
I’m not sure it’d have worked at all to be honest, which is a real shame since he’s obviously an extremely talented player and could’ve potentially been superb at another time. Ah well.

10680~~~
You hadnt even been linked with him pre season, was during international break.

As for the excitement, I dont think ive ever known such a commotion on here.

Heres some from the eerly pages




















To be fair theres a few words of warning in there, I dont think even we got that  mad when we signed Torres though, but we did get quite excited! <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10681~~~
Jesus were a lot of us (very well including myself) off the mark <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>.

Oh well, better than being pessimistic about it I suppose!

10682~~~
Well yeah I can see why many were excited, I wanted him at Chelsea during his Atletico days, but I could see a  massive difference  at Monaco and since the injury which made me completely change my opinion.

Must not leave out Kid Moyes!

10683~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I was expecting the same.

10684~~~
The injury did change him completely but IMHO he was already on the decline at Monaco before it.

10685~~~
Yeah I saw that, but  his goal ratio was still decent.

10686~~~
What did it turn out as? DDG followed by Carrick?

10687~~~
Since the injury at Monaco?  He only played a handful of games, and even then limited minutes. 

Or did you notice something before his injury?

10688~~~
Monaco started the seaosn with up top alone but in the end the woeful Rivière managed to start him regularly and ended scoring often.

10689~~~
I put the slight drop in Falcao's performances at Monaco down to lack of motivation. He never wanted to be there.

10690~~~
He's talking about the 5-6 months after he moved from Atletico before the injury in January 2014.

10691~~~
Yep. And than followed by Rooney.

10692~~~
yeah as I said at Monaco <b>and</b> since  the injury. He didnt look as sharp or strong as he did at his previous two clubs, but I wasnt sure if it was down to the quality of the league he was now in. Its worth noting even though I was lambasted for the words of warning I never expected him to be quite as bad as he was.

10693~~~
What's funny about all of this is that he actually started off quite well with us. You could see class in his first few performances even if he wasn't getting on the scoresheet. Then gradually his whole game fell apart.

10694~~~
Bloody hell  My post <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I remember writing it too with so much joy. Painful.

10695~~~
I love that "one of the finest squads in world football" is followed by an expectation to 'challenge' for 3rd. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10696~~~
I'm quite please with my first post in the Falcao thread

This was in response to one of the muppets. Really it was directed towards them all

10697~~~
But would you really want to do it any differently? Sure it didn't work out, but it was very exciting at the time.

10698~~~
My first post in this thread. Comes across a bit harsh as I genuinely wanted Falcao (and the rest of our players) to succeed. But didnt agree with the signing then, and obviously it hasnt worked out.

10699~~~
Those are the kinds of % odds I lose bets on <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

10700~~~
As bad as he was for us I cant help but miss him. In a sport populated with Terrys Gerrards and Rooneys a gentleman really stands out.

10701~~~
Of course it could be worse! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10702~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> FFS

10703~~~
Don't understand the Falcao being a gentleman thing. It was constantly in the paper him being upset about not playing, or his agent, or family.

10704~~~
I literally remember watching falcao youtube vids all night with a few mates when we signed him whilst taking the piss out of my scouse Liverpool mate <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

good times.

10705~~~
I was under the impression that the "loan" was in fact a transfer. That's how it was presented in the press at the time. I was all for him staying but, oh well.

10706~~~
FFs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10707~~~
What does that even <i>mean</i>?

Are Mata, Herrera, de Gea, Smalling, Jones, Rafael, Valdes, Januzaj, Young, Blind, Rojo, Wilson, Carrick, Valencia, di Maria, Hernandez not 'gentlemen'?

And that's just our squad, I could do the same with every squad in the PL.

No offense to you, I know you mean well, but it's that kind of bizarrely over-sentimental claptrap that made this thread (and to an extent, this loan deal itself) so fecking unbearable.

People acting like the guy was some kind of samaritan who rocked up in Manchester and gave half of his £250,000 a week wages to poverty stricken locals or something.

He's a Mendes player who seems pleasant enough and tried his best and wasn't good enough - and he was paid obscenely for the honour.

He certainly shouldn't be vilified or spoken badly of, but at the same lets not pretend that Falcao gave us something that we haven't got elsewhere, or that he was some kind of love spreading guru that was heaven sent.

10708~~~
To a degree I agree with you, and I think we currently have one of the most likable and for lack of a better word gentlemanly squads in England. But we dont hear about them, we always get the affairs, the stamps, the assaults and the other misdemeanors of players force fed to us by a media geared to the lowest common denominator, so when genuinely likable guys rock up they stand out

10709~~~
Wasn't it in his first match he hit this outrageous volley? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

10710~~~
I think that was against Leicester. Not sure. Cracking hit.

10711~~~
He regressed badly during the season, he looked a lot sharper vs QPR, Leicester, Everton than he did for all remaining games.

10712~~~
Ah yeah, that was probably it. Really thought he'd explode on the scene after a few games. The injury he got in late November(?) really put him off his stride.

10713~~~
That was when he still had self confidence.

10714~~~
He was playing well/scoring during that Christmas game. Dropping him that time didn't make too much sense really.

10715~~~
During XMas time, he got starts in many games.
Put simply, he could not score the goals which he was brought in for. Ergo - he was fired.

If he had scored 20 league goals for us this year, I actually think we could've challenged for the league title, but alas, he scored 4 and the rest is history.

I think LVG was very patient with him - at R.Madrid, he'd probably have got lynched for scoring 4 goals in a season.
Good luck to him in his future, though. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on how he does next year.

10716~~~
True, the standards at Real are so different, Bale supposedly has been poor, Ancelotti gets sacked immediately when he doesnt win a prize in a season (just behind a brilliant barca), and we celebrate a manager because we came 4th.

10717~~~
I wont ever forget his assist against Newcastle for Wayne.

10718~~~
Am sure it was 3-1 at the time too. If only that had gone in things might have worked out differently.

10719~~~
That's the problem when your club has got used to huge money signings constantly like Chelsea. You get all a bit too blasé about it.

Apart from a few real standout buys, like Rooney, Ferdinand, Berbatov and Van Persie, we've not really gone top names. Last season seemed to signal a distinct change, with Falcao and Di Maria.

Shame one was a colossal disaster, and one peaked as early as September!

10720~~~
I was genuinely thrilled when we signed Di Maria and Falcao. It was like 10 christmas's in one go

I put money on us to win the Prem (esp as we werent in the ECL), I was that happy

I remember feeling similarly elated when we signed Veron too, there's definitely a pattern here.................

In the paper today saying LVG is searching for a world class striker. Lets hope he finds someone I've never heard of ;-)

10721~~~
All the players messages to him etc makes me more sad now that he is gone <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
Let's have him back! We carried Anderson for so many years for being a nice guy afterall.

10722~~~
Yes, Leicester. Sometime you have to wonder if that incredible volley would´ve gone in the auld onion bag, if things would´ve been so different. Confidence is a funny thing.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xlZvm9dYWWQ?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

10723~~~
Ya and his first goal. He went crazy!!

10724~~~
As much as his confidence got sapped as the season went on I think having injuries during a season where he needed to be injury free to even gave a chance to get to his best, was too much.

10725~~~
Looking through some of my old posts too and stumbled across this... <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

10726~~~
Behave! <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

What a let down though.

10727~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Sorry couldn't resist

10728~~~
Very understandable <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

10729~~~
Surely it's "realistic"?

10730~~~
It was always a gamble but on the other hand, I don't see why we shouldn't have tried it at that time. I think most of us thought he would do well and rightly so. There is never a guarantee

10731~~~
Never any direct quotes. Never pitched a fit like Tevez

10732~~~
Back when this happened I'd have shipped half the strikeforce out in a heartbeat for Falcao. Such a shame how it all worked out for him.

10733~~~
I was never convinced that either of them [Di Maria and Falcao] would be great in the EPL. My own theory is that a player must prove himself in the EPL before he can be considered to have guaranteed success, when joining another EPL club.
Costa bucked this trend.
Fabrigas (superb passing, EPL experience, knows possession football) was the player I wanted last Summer and I'd happily have paid £60M for him. He was the dream player we needed and IMO would've helped us win games and dominate possession.

Veron - I was young when he arrived and I was convinced before he played his first game for us, that he was going to be the best player in our league. He dominated the Italian league, which at the time was the best league in the World, so in the EPL, he'd be unstoppable...surely. Alas, he was decent, but was not great and eventually got sold to Chelsea and then back to Italy.

Without a 20 goal per season striker, I just can't see us winning the league, so we absolutely need a top class striker.
Had Falcao scored 20 goals this season, I'm convinced we'd have been title contenders.
Using my theory above, we need a player who has EPL experience and has already proved himself in the EPL. Apart from Kane, I can't think of anybody else who fits the bill.

10734~~~
Kane won't score 20 next season anyway.

10735~~~
This.  Quite Bizaare really.  Maybe that was just adrenalin getting him through.  He had that decent little spell of 2 goals and a few assists in 90 minute run outs over christmas.  After the couple of assists against newcastle and then after he planted the header against Villa i remember saying "now watch him go"........genuinley thought that was when he'd start rattling them in for fun.  Goal against stoke just after, the spurs game at the end of the xmas period he was decent but like the rest of the squad looked tired.  Then he was dropped to the bench there after!

Most excited i have ever been over a signing.  Was buzzing walking to the ground for the QPR match.

Hope he goes and gets fit and returns to something near what he was (unless he stays in the prem), but realistically, no way could we have made the signing permanent

10736~~~
<b>Falcao in talks with Chelsea
</b>
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-united/9869913/Radamel-Falcao-in-transfer-talks-with-Chelsea" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.teamtalk.com/manchester-united/9869913/Radamel-Falcao-in-transfer-talks-with-Chelsea</a>

Oh dear . Weird one if true.

10737~~~
Sounds like Jose signing but would he really get a game ahead of Costa? I think it'll be another season on the bench taking over from Drogba.

10738~~~
Costa will miss a fair few games, he can't stay fit. Not really bothered though, Falcao is finished as a top striker.

10739~~~
if falcao does go to chelsea it'll be one of the most bizarre transfers i've ever seen.

10740~~~
Please, no, please god no. We need  CB and a midfielder...

10741~~~
I really hope he does go to Chelsea, he's bloody awful.

10742~~~
Although the meltdown on here if he scored loads for us would be hilarious, its not going to happen and could cost us the title with his wages.

10743~~~
On the one hand, he looked finished in most of his appearances for us. But on the other, it'd be just our luck for him to go to Chelsea and bang in 20 goals next season... I hope he goes abroad, it'd be the best move all round.

10744~~~
If he was our only signing in an attacking position I'd be very worried. I highly doubt that'll be the case, though, so I'm not <i>too </i>concerned.

Falcao, Griezmann, and a midfielder and I'm happy.

10745~~~
Falcao going to Chelsea will be bad news. You don't need a pacey striker at Chelsea, you need someone who is clinical. Falcao <i>did</i> miss the chances he had at United, but they were hardly falling from the heavens. Constant chances put on his plate at Chelsea and I reckon he'll be firing them in. Most retired strikers say you don't ever lose your ability to finish.

10746~~~
Most don't lose Their ability to stand either but somehow he did.

10747~~~
id be inclined to agree with this. I doubt Chelsea would ask him to do most of his work 40 yards from goal

10748~~~
Torres and Owen suggest you do.

10749~~~
Parallels with Shevchenko.

I think this is driven by Mourinho's ego in wanting to prove he can manage Falcao better. Could be a good deal if they could get him on the cheap and I think Monaco would wanna clear his wages of their bill too. Win-win.

10750~~~
If he goes to Chelsea and starts scoring goals, this place will be a madhouse.

10751~~~
Do people honestly think he's going to return to form?

Or is it naturally cynical people who always fear the worst who are saying it?

10752~~~
this is most likely the case, and I hope it actually is.

10753~~~
I think there's plenty of people who wouldn't be surprised if he returned to form next season and started banging in the goals. Of course he didn't look the same player for us and in no way justified us spending out so much in wages and a fee to make the deal permanent but I have a bad feeling we will regret it if he does sign for Chelsea.

It's such a shame it didn't work out for him here it really is but never mind, he's a good guy so wish him well but it's sure not going to be very fun seeing this thread bumped if he does sign for a rival and start finding the net regularly again. Fair enough if he wants to prove himself in the Premier League but I hope he moves to a league abroad so any goals he scores don't affect our title hopes.

10754~~~
Dunno about rest and why they say what they said but i believe he would do better next season (if he stayed with us). In general,believe he gonna improve next season,some teams and their play style might gonna suit him more or less. Now,am i worried about him scoring tones of goals for some other team? Not really,from our point of view,we (or more accurate,OT crowd) gave him 100% support,some could say that he did not deserved it with his performances but thats bs for me.

10755~~~
I hope he gets back to top level, but we just couldn't take a chance with him after his horrible season here, he looks nowhere near good enough.

10756~~~
Kind of a cock move from him but hey he is looking after himself. We rehabilitated him for a year, lined his pockets heavily and treated him like a hero when he wasnt performing like one. And he goes and signs for our biggest challengers...

10757~~~
Owen never lost his ability to finish for Manchester United. He lost other attributes but that was something he never lost. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/skG-m1Dh_oc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

10758~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10759~~~
If he gets back to 75% of what he once was, he will be starting ahead of Costa

10760~~~
I know it hasnt happened yet, im hurt in advance.

10761~~~
Good post.

Terrible post.

<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

10762~~~
I think Costa will stay fit next season. A summer of rest will do him good. Hopefully he will pick up some suspension though... he deserves them.

10763~~~
I will have no surprise that if he joins Chelsea he will score plenty of tap ins, there wingers get behind defences much better than we do. 

The fact is though for the money required he didn't do/show enough when he had the chance. He doesn't fit in with the way LVG wants to play and he certainly isn't fast/strong enough to deal with most PL defences. 

I would have preferred to keep Welbeck to be honest!

10764~~~
I'll be pretty pissed off if we get this guy, even on loan.

10765~~~
He won't reach the heights of his Athletico days, but I think he will find his goalscoring boots again. Hopefully it's not at Chelsea.

10766~~~
He'd be brave/silly to have another go in the PL. 

Presumably he'll still be on big wages so would be silly from Chelsea too. Better for everyone if he goes to Italy.

10767~~~
I don't think he'll go to Chelsea. I think what is currently happening is Mendes' is using his Mourinho links to show confidence in his player and it shows Falcao's confidence in himself that he's considering a Premier League move.

I expect him to end up back in Spain or in Italy.

10768~~~
If this rumour is true it seems Mourinho is helping out his stable-mate at the expense of Chelsea. I can't personally see any footballing reason after the season he's had at United.

Surely someone like Benteke or a young striker with potential would be the way forward.

10769~~~
I'm surprised Chelsea want him to be honest after watching him play for us.

10770~~~
I didn't think of that. I think you're right. These agents are shrewd little bastards, it's crazy how much influence they can have.

10771~~~
My thoughts exactly. Given how poor hes been in the league i just cant see another PL team pick him up. My money's on him staying at Monaco

10772~~~
Worth a gamble if his fee/wages arent too obscene. The guys was unbelievable before the injury, and he's had a year to get used to the PL now. One year loan with option to buy wouldnt be terrible.

10773~~~
That's what I'd prefer too, but Benteke would cost £30m and wouldn't even start.

10774~~~
I dont think we will see the old lethal Falcao but I can see him doing better at Chelsea due to the players they have.

10775~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10776~~~
Fixed

10777~~~
That's one game where he didn't in amongst many, many where he missed chances he'd have put away in his sleep when he was younger.

Hell in his very first game he was put through and I immediately thought 'goal' and he sliced in wide in comical fashion. He did that so often.

10778~~~
Very true. People point to the City game and say "only he could have scored that goal" but he missed some sitters for us during his time with us. Even the likes of RvN started to lose their finishing powers towards the end of their career.

10779~~~
Shouldn't this be in the football forum now...?

10780~~~
Knowing Chelsea and our luck, they'll get Falcao and he'll score like 50 goals for them next season.

10781~~~
I find it weird again that he actually played for us. Michael Owen played for Manchester United. Bizarre.

10782~~~
There might be something to this. Denis Law, in his last season at United, really went off the boil. He was injured a lot (as was Owen) which may have contributed, but he just didn't look sharp and he'd lost that half-yard of pace. He underwent a renaissance at City for a while but it was short lived.

10783~~~
Even if he goes to Chelsea and scores 12 goals, our decision to not make his loan deal permanent would still be justified.

10784~~~
He'd be a great addition to Chelsea. Mourinho obviously knows all about him from his Madrid days and he would be able to swap out with Costa since both are likely to intermittently miss games to injury.

10785~~~
Has he played CL football yet? It seems he always joins a team not in CL, once they qualify he goes to another team, and so forth...

10786~~~
Is it just me or was Falcao fit for the whole season?

10787~~~
He played CL for Porto in 09/10, and mostly Europa League elsewhere.

10788~~~
He played for Porto in the competition in 2009/10, he scored against Arsenal in the last 16 tie.

10789~~~
Personally i think finishing, like other attributes in professional sport, is down to your fitness. As you age your body changes through injuries and it affects your balance, strikers tend to rely more on their composure than other positions so it stands to reason as you get older, like pace, its a attribute that can start to diminish. Just a thought.

10790~~~
Why is this thread still in the main sub-forum? 

He is officially no longer a United player

10791~~~
should be in the general forum as on last seasons form he is no longer a football player .

10792~~~
he wouldnt be a starter for Chelsea would he. The odd cup game and and sub appearances i'd say.

Would not bother me if Chelsea signed him, he is well beyond his peak.

10793~~~
Oh sheeeet.

10794~~~
The entertainment forum, given his laughable attempts to stay on his feet. I dare say his video compilation wouldn't look out of place on America's funniest home videos. He might even win the damn thing.

10795~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10796~~~
Yeah, was asking this myself...

We've got a thread about a Monaco player in the United forum!

10797~~~
I would be very happy if Chelsea stumped up the reported 25mill and his 250k a week wages, I just can't see him returning to anywhere near his best, he'd also be sitting on Chelsea's bench for 90% of the time considering Mourinho's clear no.1 is Costa and he doesn't like to rotate... at all, just can't see it working for well for them.

10798~~~
That was probably the sales pitch we were sold

10799~~~
And isn't that what happened?

10800~~~
To be fair we're probably the only ones discussing him anyway.

10801~~~
Wouldn't say so. Considering his wages and return, wasn't worth it. Probably would have been better to keep Hernandez or give more playing time to Wilson personally.

10802~~~
I read today that Monaco have to sell him this season and any loan deal will likely be rejected but if they honestly think they could get £25m for him they are in for a surprise.

Probably the worst striker I have ever seen play for United. Genuinely. He got such an easy ride because of his previous reputation, its untrue. 

Couldn't shoot, couldn't score, couldn't run, couldn't dribble, couldn't control the ball, couldn't hold the ball up, couldn't run without falling over, couldn't pass more then 10 yards...he could barely even strike a ball cleanly. And I really could go on. 

If he gets back to his best, it will be a Lazarus like comeback.

10804~~~
Costa is a bit of a sicknote so Falcao would be a good insurance policy for Joe-Say.

10805~~~
Chelsea move is tied to Cechs transfer to us. We were committed to a £25m payment as part of the loan deal. We will buy Cech for £25m and Chelsea will buy Falcao for £25m. We're basically donating Falcao to Chelsea and getting cech in return.

10806~~~
We'll never pay £25m for a 33 year old keeper

10807~~~
It's the £25m we'd already committed to paying for Falcao so we're basically getting Cech free and Chelsea are getting Falcao in return.

10808~~~
Are you saying we agreed to pay £25m last season and backed out? Because i really doubt that is how loan deals work. If he doesnt sign for Chelsea and goes to say Valencia, we have to pay them £25m to take him? For example, Nanis over in Portugal and i dont think we are holding Sporting to pay a fee for him. And him and Falcao have the same agent

When we signed Falcao i remember people saying we paid £6m for the loan + his wages. IF we took the option to sign him we would pay £40m at the end of the term. I've never heard anything about already agreeing something for this summer

10809~~~
If this happens and he joins Chelsea can not wait to see how pundits will spin all their statements from this season about him and start giving praise,how its great buy,great player and he gonna start scoring 100% etc. Almost similar thing happened with Welbeck,rarely heard praise for him while he was with us,the moment he joined Arsenal,oh boy...great player/this/that,he gonna score tones as striker bla bla bla.

10810~~~
Shame, he had some bright moments for us. I was encouraged about the possibility of his loan being extended to January 2016. A great striker doesn't turn shit overnight. Wait, I just thought about Torres, never mind!

10811~~~
You have to remember that it was an incredibly serious injury that he suffered a year and a half ago. One that retires some players and affects others for the rest of their careers. Maybe he's playing scared now, or maybe he's lost a lot of mobility and it's affected his confidence/ability to play like he used to.
Some players get lucky and can carry on at a high level after it like Shearer and van Nistelrooy, but others like Michael Owen and Alessandro Del Piero had their games changed completely by the injury.

10812~~~
Same reason the 2014/15 performance threads are still active...i think, this season isn't officially over and next season hasn't started yet.

10813~~~
Its kind of sad that whenever a team wants to sign a high profile veteran striker on loan, United will be referenced with the successes(Larsson) and the failures(Falcao).

10814~~~
Pah, Larsson made up for Falcao. He was a much smarter footballer than I'd previously given him credit for.

10815~~~
We have to pay Monaco £25m (the loan was pretty much a sham) we could pay this direct to Monaco but they would then have an unhappy Falcao (and his wages) on their books.

If the fee goes via Chelsea we get Cech and they get Falcao and Monaco get their cash and get Falcao off their books. Works for everyone.

Mendes.

10816~~~
Any proof of this, or is it a hunch?

10817~~~
Stringing together bits of knowledge plus an understanding of how the system works. In the age of the agent and FFP nothing is straight forward...

10818~~~
its generally accepted he started decent then got worse as the season went on. that to me suggests he was in the wrong environment. while he might not be the player he once was he is surely better than what we seen this season

10819~~~
Sorry but I call BS. 

I fail to think United, a club which has enjoyed a lot of success commercially, would agree this type of deal. In fact that's the beauty of a loan, you see the goods before you buy

10820~~~
I don't know who is going to be more upset, United fans when De Gea leaves or me when Falcao joins Chelsea.

10821~~~
Clue is in his tagline...

10822~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

10823~~~
I think hes probably going to be banging in goals again next season.
Heres hoping its not in the premier league so i can be happy for him.

10824~~~
By who? you mean the times where we were all blindly rooting for him?

10825~~~
Im gonna need a new tag line then.

10826~~~
I was pretty impressed with him, at the beginning. Some really good link up play. Got quite a few assists early on, didn't he?

10827~~~
Think he'l do better than Remy as 2nd choice. What he needs more than anything else is goals to get his confidence back, we dont create enough. You will.

10828~~~
I'll be absolutely flabbergasted if they actually pay a fee for him. Can't believe they're taking him on altogether to be honest.

10829~~~
You'll think I'm mad but I think Falcao would do well for you. Not 20+goals well but I reckon he could bag 10-15 goals for you.

10830~~~
Would this have anything to do with the fact that you really wanted him to succeed ?

10831~~~
If a striker needs to get his confidence back, Chelsea is the last place on earth to go. We've been a graveyard for strikers for about 20 years (Drog and Costa aside).

10832~~~
when we began the season very attack minded with all strikers on the pitch, which ended after the 5-3 at leicester

10833~~~
Anelka?
Kalou?
Sturridge ?

These were all good backups.

10834~~~
Wonder if José may experiment with two up top at all if we sign him.

10835~~~
So just 2 games then?

10836~~~
I'm thinking of big money (fees/wages) strikers as well. From Fleck to Sutton to Sheva to Torres (and many, many more). 

I forgot Jimmy though, he was the dog's tits.

10837~~~
One would hope we all want all our players to succeed. If you're implying such means our opinions should be disregarded then the United forum would be awfully quiet if you had your way.

I didn't want him. Thought it was a bloody stupid buy. I don't think I had any desperate desire to see something positive that wasn't there.

10838~~~
Always wondered why you let Crespo go, that goal against Wigan was legendary - either that or i just got used to seeing it so much.

10839~~~
if I told you he walked in a straight line you wouldn't have it would you.

10840~~~
Crespo actually played well and had a decent scoring rate for us. He and his family just couldn't settle. I never count him alongside the flops personally.

10841~~~
I put "really" there for a reason because of the kind of expectations the fans had for Falcao, the move itself was a strange one,but one the whole entire fan base welcomed, we had dreams of seeing Falcao tear up the league, i obviously want every United player in the team to succeed, but Falcao's case was special, we were all behind him at first, which might have blinded most of us -i once argued with an Arsenal for suggesting United fans were making basic movements/skills etc seem World Class, which looking back, might very well be true....i mean look at the reaction to his first goal against Everton.

10842~~~
We're wondering why Chelsea would take on Falcao, but just imagine for a second he finds his feet in the Prem during a second season and becomes more like the striker he used to be? I'd be devastated <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> not only cause we didn't keep him for another year (would never have happened anyway) but also because it'd highlight how shite we are at creating and getting the best out of certain players.

10843~~~
Fair enough. I can see what you're getting at there.

But, no, I don't think I bought in to that. Was too busy moaning at us throwing money around blindly to get excited. Also - I don't want much foreign football so I had no strong opinion about him as a player (I just didn't like the idea of signing someone after his injury).

10844~~~
Really <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> As far as I can remember, he got that tagline for similar transfer related wumming

10845~~~
No. Because he'd probably fall over.

10846~~~
I remember the Yeovil centre half had him in his pocket last January. He looks like a player who is totally passed it. I dont see it working out well for him at Chelsea. He'll probably join the CFC Strikers Graveyard with Mutu, Torres and Shevchenko.

10847~~~
Falcao is finished as a top level footballer. If he goes to Chelsea I wouldn't be concerned in the slightest. In fact, they can waste £150k a week on him if they want, it will leave them less money for other players.
I was really excited when he arrived and I love his attitude on the pitch, but physically he is f*cked. Shame, but there you go......

10848~~~
He wouldnt have the pressure that you'd normally associate with big names or fees. If anything, his poor time with us will help him. People won't expect much and he'l have the large shadow of Costa to work under. Even if he becomes half the player he was, you'l have the best 2nd choice striker going about. 

I really think this could turn out to be a great move for you. What he'l need though is some goals early on. Get that and he'l do well.

10849~~~
It'll be at a cut down price, I wouldn't mind betting.

10850~~~
I hope he doesn't go there because it'll cause us all to have nightmares about him suddenly rediscovering his old self and banging goals in left and right for the rentboys.

10851~~~
In fairness to Anelka... I'm pretty sure he led the league in goals one season (at Chelsea)

10852~~~
Time to let go. Viya con dios, el Tigre.
