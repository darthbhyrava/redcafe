1~~~
Welcome!

2~~~
Get in!

3~~~
Welcome Anthony.

4~~~
Become a legend by scoring against the scousers.

5~~~
Sweet.

I hope he's really good really soon.

6~~~
Who?

7~~~
Future Ballon d'Or winner I called it.

<span style="color: #ffffff">never seen him play</span>

8~~~
Can he play in goals

9~~~
He looked amazing against Valencia.

10~~~
Hopefully the start of something special.

11~~~
Welcome Martial, hope you can add goals to our attack!

12~~~
So where should we send him on loan?

13~~~
Welcome 'surprise' striker.

14~~~
I'm thinking 10-15 goals max, similar to Memphis. Still not enough, another striker is needed.

15~~~
Never heard of him, but the money paid by the club suggests the man has immense talent.

16~~~
Needs to bulk up
Poor decision-making
Playing in the wrong position, put him up front
Playing in the wrong position, put him on the wing
Inexperienced and inconsistent 
Does not fit LVG's philosophy 
No end product

Just thought I'd start early  <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

17~~~
Gotta trust the club on this one!

18~~~
Not going to lie never seen him play before, his videos online don't look much either but we obviously have scouted him for a while and you have to put faith in the club for that, I mean no one thought we would sign Darmian but we obviously done our homework on him and he has been immense.

19~~~
Considering the fees, I think it's one of the most ballsiest transfers we've ever made. Big gamble but a very exciting signing too!

20~~~
Fantastic news.

21~~~
£36 million? 

Woody found that down the sofa. No risk at all.

22~~~
Not been impressed so far.

23~~~
At least he and Memphis add some dynamism to our attack. Rather them than the Falcao/RVP slowmo play of last season.

24~~~
Will he be thrown straight in the deep end against Liverpool? Just can't wait to see him play!!! Bloody international break!

25~~~
Really looking forward to see him play, and I really hope that he'll be used as a #9.

26~~~
As other said, I hope we end up paying the entire sum <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Exciting to sign a young talent, saw Squawka claimed on twitter he was the highest scoring (in league goals) teenager last year

27~~~
He ll play behind Rooney. So that we can bench Herrera <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/><img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

28~~~
We finally got our Henry

29~~~
He has a great surname.

30~~~
You forgot Danny welbeck mk2 <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Seriously score against scousers and he will have paid back £30 mill of his fee

31~~~
Has the total possible fee been confirmed?

36m or 58m..?

32~~~
At last, we have pacey player who seems like know how to dribble also.

33~~~

34~~~
Nice. A number 9 with pace and power. Should be fun. Hoping LVG develops him properly.

35~~~
Memphis - Martial
<span style="color: #ffffff">------------</span>Herrera<span style="color: #ffffff">-</span><span style="color: #000000">-</span><span style="color: #ffffff">-</span>Mata

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

36~~~
€30m up front plus another €5m each year for the coming four years = €50m = £36m. That's the guaranteed fee.

Another €5m if he wins English golden boot (capped at €15m)
Another €5m if he wins Golden Boy award
Another €10m if he wins Ballon d'Or as a United player

Potential fee = €80m = £56m

Which means that if we end up paying £56m he'll have been top scorer three times, won the golden boy award plus the Ballon d'Or = worth it.

37~~~
I read its £36m rising to £58m but in order for that to happen he'd have to near enough become the best player on the planet.

38~~~
Seems like a good deal. I would have valued him at 25m as a base fee, but the add ons would make him more than worth it.

If he matches all the incentives over his contract he would be worth 150m + the way football is going

39~~~
Man Utd are Kung Fu Fighting
Martial is fast as lightning
In fact, he's a little bit frightening
He scores with expert timing

Lets get it going people.

40~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Excellent

41~~~
Can't wait

42~~~
Martial will break the number #9 curse.

43~~~
have a feeling this will very quickly become our best selling shirt!

44~~~
No way captain fantastic is getting dropped, LVG loves him too much.

45~~~
Just like RVP?

46~~~
He'll be our main guy this season nonetheless, that much is clear. He'll be given the full season to prove himself and if he doesn't he'll get cut.

47~~~
RVP was dropped yes but we had options back then so it didn't matter, I don't expect to see rooney benched Simply because we have no one else. LVG is obviously happy to keep playing him considering we didn't sign another striker this window. 

Martial won't be taking his place.

48~~~
It's going to be like deja vu all over again.

49~~~
The structure of the deal is very very good for united, I like that from Woodward. LVG was adamant on pace and now he has pace in his attack in the center.
Still think we are one great attacker short of a title challenge but i hope martial can surprise us. 
Looked amazing against valencia and also against arsenal, which isnt guarantee of anything but the way everyone rates him in french football and  quotes from many experts in the field really comfort you. Like this from ex chief scout of a french club, forget about the club was mentioned on twitter
.



You can read his time line for more. I like this signing, i also think the right  price of the player is what the buyer is willing to pay, for cristiano it was 80 million, we are ready to pay 100 million for muller, it all depends what the buyer wants to pay Rest of it is just analysis by idiots like us. 

I hope he plays against liverpool, they have defence problems and he can cause them some problems with his pace and physicality. His movement will be a source of delight for mata and herrera who finall have a striker who has good movement and pace to get on their through balls. He also plays well with is back to goal so we can use the fellaini tactic without the need of fellaini. Last year we were ready to pay similar amount for an ageing forward who was declining, this year we pay for potential in someone. I always want my club to pay for potential, its always exciting . So LVG was right all along a striker Press dint link o us, a player not in the papers and a true SURPRISE. The noises coming out of club say we scouted him for 1 year regularly and Monaco not being in champions league was the only way deal was possible, before that he was off the market. Chelsea were interested and he was linked to barcelona and spurs so its not as if he is the new bebe. I would rather sign him now rather than wonder 2 years down the line why dont we take a risk on such players like atletico madrid/porto/spurs do.

50~~~
I am moist.

Would love to see how he can link up with Herrera or Mata playing behind him but instead we'll have Rooney's rapist touch. Ahh well hopefully he can finish a chance or two.

51~~~
Sorry if I only quoted this bit, but it's an important bit for me.

Some people wonder why we don't seem to be in for players before they're worth upwards of 30m (like the likes of Modric for example) but when United wants a young player with potential, you can bet clubs will be asking more money from us than someone like Spurs. It might seem steep now but if the club's done their work scouting wise (and they should have), it could turn out to be money well spent.

Like you said, it's better to sign him now that 2-3 years down the road when he'll probably be worth higher.

52~~~
I hope we play him as no.9
Won't be worse than Rooney for sure.

53~~~
I shall be calling him Tony Marshall.

54~~~
So basically we paid 30 mill plus add ons which if we end up paying makes him a bargain.

55~~~
Done nothing to show me that he's good enough to replace Rooney in the last couple of hours.

56~~~
I suppose we have to remember that Fergie was once ready to pay around 30 million pounds for a 19-year-old Lucas Moura. We must be absolutely convinced he's the real deal.

It's a desperate transfer if there ever was one but he's an exciting player to have.

57~~~
Think he will be an excellent signing, the surprise striker Louis was talking about. The club scouted him and Louis seems happy with him, should be an excellent number 9. I just got the feeling this guy will turn out to be great for us. Cant wait to see him in action for us if i am honest

58~~~
I remember sir alex saying no to pato when we were quoted 12 million for him as a 16 year old. 
Atletico madrid paid 23 million euros in 2006 for aguero! he was younger than Martial is right now (just 18!)
Luis ronaldo was signed by barcelona at 19 years for a fee of 12 million in 1994!
Jamez rodriguez was 22 and signed for monaco for 48 million euros
Isco was bought for 30 millon euros by madrid (release clause)
Nani,anderson,rio,rooney all examples of the same.

I think united fans have been very used to genius of fergie buying players for peanuts and them turning to gems, now this does not happen as everyone has a good scouting system, hell even Football manager have their own scouts and their database is used by clubs. It is almost impossible to find rare jewels like carlos bacca . We may find them sometimes, but if you want best player at peak buying them young and paying a premium for them is better than buying them for double after they settle and there is too much competition for them. 36 MILLION does represent a risk, but club would not dispense with that amount without  making sure he had a good chance of being worth it. Rooney was bought at that time for 30 million and has been one of the most succesful signing this club has made, Same for rio ferdinand, it pays to buy players young and paying a premium for them rather than paying Double. Madrid do it with spanish players all the time. Most clubs do it, we do it too, its just that he is french and no one in england knows about him that fans are nervous.

59~~~
Looking at his Valencia match highlights, he loves a dribble. If he can consistently take on and beat players like he did in that game, he will give us a lot going forward. We're sorely missing players who can beat a man, dragging opposition players out of position. Against teams that park the bus, that is absolutely essential.

I expect LVG to ease him in with several sub appearances in the coming weeks. Will be interesting to see if he replaces Rooney in matches, but I expect Rooney will drop to number 10, with Martial up top.

60~~~
If it's of any relevance he has pretty decent figures at youth level.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/dCvygy5.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/dCvygy5.png"/>

61~~~
It's almost scary to think this lad is the only difference in player from the crap we've been served so far. Will be interesting to see how we reshuffle but I think he should play from day one. Can we afford to ease him in? We're not in good shape. We need a real shift of attitude after the international break.

62~~~
I'm glad he has another French speaker in Schneiderlin to help him out.

63~~~
Fellaini is there too.

64~~~
I'd prefer him getting used to playing number 9 for us with Mata behind. Rooneys form lately has been shocking and Mata might provide better service for him to use his pace.

65~~~
What a way to introduce yourself to the Man Utd fans. He is going to be playing at Old Trafford against Liverpool in his first United game. The ovation he is going to get will be amazing kinda depending on the score.

66~~~
I'd be very surprised if he plays. Maybe ten minutes at the end if we need a goal, which going by our recent league games is a likely possibility.

67~~~
Anyone know when France are playing?

68~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

69~~~
Playing Portugal away on Friday the 4th in a friendly.

70~~~
That jawline is ridiculous.

71~~~
LvG.

72~~~
The right price is what most of the big clubs would generally pay for him. It definitely isn't what the buyer is willing to pay, otherwise there would be no such thing as getting ripped off. £100m for Muller is nothing short of ridiculous imo

73~~~
only 2 pages in this thread. Lots of enthusiasm i see.

Hope he gets games for France. Would love to get to see what he can do

74~~~
They are all in the other thread. This is just the performances thread.

75~~~
Will he start against pool?

76~~~
Guessing he'll be a sub.

77~~~
Surprised to see him married with a kid at such young age.

78~~~
Cool. Hopefully that means he's very mature and won't lose any focus chasing the ladies like a young Lee Sharpe.

79~~~
Hope he can make an impact this season already but wouldn't be surprised if he didn't.

80~~~
The price tag is a lot whichever way you look at it but hopefully he will do very well for us, are we looking at the future main man for us, our number 9 who will get us all the important goals? That is what we have paid for but we will need to give him time. At first I was underwhelmed but am excited now. Yes I watched his performances against Valencia on youtube and he looked excellent and a real threat for someone so young, especially considering they were big games. I'm excited to see him develop with us, but also as it stands he already brings what we have been lacking, as in pace and directness.

81~~~
Looking forward to the Liverpool match now! Can't wait to see him sit on the bench for 80 minutes and then have no time to show what he's really about.

82~~~
Been watching more of Martial these last couple of days, and as far as I can tell the Henry comparison although understandable given their similar (but not quite) style, nationality and history at Monaco, seems a bit off base. Honestly don't think he has the ability to turn into an Henry type forward that could pick the ball up at the halfway line, beat 5 players and end up scoring a goal. He will have to rely on his team-mates to bring him into play to a larger degree.

Somehow reminds me more of a young Fernando Torres at Atletico, who was arguably the biggest striking talent of his age bracket, laughable as it may sound now. Comparable levels of long striding pace and overall frame, excellent change of direction, takes up good positions for his age, not the greatest ball control though, and dunno how to explain this - but he naturally 'knows' where the goal is once it's in range, and just like young Torres scores in a lot of different ways. Can't remember exactly who said this (Aragones?), but it was something to the effect of - no two of Torres' goals are alike.

Martial gives a similar vibe, and hopefully with experience and greater consistency, he can develop into the type of striker Torres was later on in his first stint at Atletico, and the first couple of seasons at Liverpool. Much more excited about this signing that I initially was, irrespective of the transfer fee. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

83~~~
I wouldn't dismiss it though. Of the videos i have seen most of them are of him cutting in from the left to create an opportunity for a team mate or a goal scoring chance? Something Henry did pretty much every game. I think that's where the comparisons lie.

As an example, when i youtube Martial goal on youtube it comes up with a scout nation video. The first goal of the compilation he picks it up on the half way line on the left, cuts in then scores near post. Might be a lazy comparison but when i last watched that video and others he more often then not appeared on the left. In my opinion he has very good close ball control with his feet that lets him get out of tight situations.

84~~~
Aren't him and Memphis potentially going to be getting in each other's way in that case?

85~~~
Well that's what i thought in all honesty. I saw someone reverse it saying it means we will get alot of joy out of the left flank with them two linking up creating chances for each other. Ill guess we'll have to wait and see!

86~~~
Yeah, too bad his contract expires after the Liverpool game.

87~~~
Yeah I get what you're trying to say, but to be fair, if we use that as a tool, a lot of strikers develop their game through wider areas. eg. Van Persie often started out wide for Feyenoord and even Arsenal, drifted in to create a chance for a team-mate or scored himself. But we can't formulate a comparison predicated heavily on that trait while ignoring a lot of other areas. A majority of his overall qualities (most prominent exclusions are aerial prowess - Martial's not a prominent heading threat like Torres yet, and sometimes his touch is inconsistent) remind me almost immediately of Torres in the mid 2000s, which isn't necessarily to dismiss the Henry comparison per se. And high chances are the ones who are making the comparison are more informed as professionals, than a casual watcher like me anyway.

88~~~
My bet is the guy will find it very hard in his first year here, his only luck is that Van Gaal will back him as he was the one who so badly needed him in our team and thrown the money for him. He loves his young players...

89~~~
Hmm he's always said money makes no difference. Never stopped him from dropping Di Maria or Herrera at times. The only case i could agree with you on is Rooney who has looked dog shit alot of the time but still gets 90 minutes.

90~~~
I don't think he'll start against Liverpool. Lvg will probably be weary of throwing him right in against our biggest rivals.

Also, any chance of him started vs Portugal or will it be benzema?

91~~~
I'd think a sub appearance, especially if the match is going well. Big if, i know.

92~~~
Considering how poor both Rooney and Memphis have been in PL games so far, I wouldn't be surprised if he got some playing time in the next few fixtures.

93~~~
Think that's why we bought him!

94~~~
I think he will start with Rooney playing behind him. He will have a fairly good debut while Rooney is going to have his usual shocker against Liverpool. So after 60 minutes he will come off and Rooney will play the whole 90 minutes to the dismay of all the people moaning about how awful and shit Rooney is.

95~~~
Not starting the friendly against Portugal. Fekir is, though.

96~~~
Bench?

97~~~
Yeah. Julien Laurens says there is a good chance he'll make his debut later on off the bench

98~~~

99~~~
On bench for france against Portugal, i think he is there just because Lacazette was injured. For anyone who was dismayed that we bought him instead of lacazette should know at martial's age lacazette's record was abysmal, lacazette is 24 now and last year and year before that is the only time he has shown some good goal scoring ability. He is 4 years elder of martial and martial had a decent run last year when he scored 8 goals in quick time.
 Martial is playing better than him at the same age. I hope he comes on today and shows some good touches. We will be dependent on him hugely if we are to succeed this year. Not ideal for him but rooney was similar age when he came here, so was ronaldo i hope he goes in that bracket rather than anderson and Nani bracket.

On another note, what a fecking great bench that is, fekir who starts confessed to media he would love to move to united. He will be a star and will be a great number 10 of the future. I hope we keep an eye on him. I feel he has better potential than Lacazette.

100~~~
Lets hope LvG doesnt coach it out of him with his philosophy bollocks. I really miiss that. So far our strikers wouldnt do that under LvG, lets hope Martial does it, because he can do it. With Rooney, Falcao and RvP, you dont expect that necesseraly.

101~~~
Indeed, like he has with.... yeah, no I can't think of anyone.

102~~~
Not striker, but plenty of other out field players, especially our mdfielders. The only hope i have is that Martial is so different than what we had/have, that he has all the freedom to damage the opponents. I have faith and hope van Gaal uses him up front and not on the right side.

103~~~
Which midfielders? Which outfield players?

Schneiderlin on in the France game. Booo he's old news now.

104~~~
Herrera?

105~~~
I thought you were going to name someone we've seen at United who had creativity taken out of him.

We don't really have a reference point with regards to Herrera in England. It's like saying Kagawa had the creativity sucked out of him, or Veron. It's a case of fitting into a different style of football. Had he gone to Barcelona he'd have to become a more discipline player as well. That's possession football vs the frantic Atletico style. 

I'm interested in this because people keep bringing it up. But has anyone of our attackers who we've had prior like Rooney, Mata, Young, Fellaini actually been curtailed? I can't see it one bit. Depay is another one who gets the licence to try all his flicks and tricks.

106~~~
Thats the thing. I expected Rooney to do more, maybe he is just past it in that regard. Martial will be intersting to follow. He is young and likes to dribble/take people on. If he suddenly changes it and backpasses it all the time/offers no movement whatsoever, i give up.

107~~~
He will pass it back as you have to in possession football, but I don't see him being restricted just like Depay who hasn't been restricted, he's just been below par (in the league).

108~~~
I agree, he is the real star of the Lyon show and would be the perfect player in the 4-2-3-1 that LVG wants to play this season.

109~~~
Get in. Martial on for Benzema.

110~~~
Playing on the left today is our Martial! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

111~~~
Great goal Valbuena

112~~~
Valbuena is class.

113~~~
Oh is this the Valbuena thread? <span style="color: white">text</span>

114~~~
hardly touched the ball..sell him!

115~~~
Bah, he's come on too late. Game mostly in France's half with Portugal chasing the equaliser.

116~~~
Well that was pointless.

117~~~
It's a bit annoying this. It's a friendly, not a Euro qualifier, so then Portugal bring on the young Silva on <i>only </i>in the 85th minute and France bring Martial on at <i>only </i>81st minute.

I don't see the point of playing Griezmann or some other established regular who's played <i>countless </i>games for France in a game that's intended to give others a chance to adapt to the French national setup. Surely it would have been more useful to bring Martial on and give him 20 mins where he can actually get the ball a few times; same with Berardo Silva for Portugal. It does <i>nothing </i>giving him 5 minutes.

118~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NcVucrhiqbc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

119~~~
I don't know about Portugal but it makes perfect sense to start Martial so late for FrancE. There are no competitive matches up until the Euro for France, only a series of friendlies so Deschamps can't really tinker that much. Deschamps has got to play his established players as often as possible in this context.
Plus the last few results having bad for France, this win was important for the moral boost and these elements explain why he gave Martial (a player who isn't important to the team yet) so few minutes.

120~~~
I bet the press have their shit stories written already waiting for an average performance. The guy is going to be under immense pressure.

121~~~
The pressure isn't on the kid, its on the club. If he does shite then the media will blame Woodward/LvG for spending so much..

122~~~
Apparently Chelsea tried to sign him and were willing to match the 36m or is that more paper bull? Sunday Times said that but it's subscription protected.

123~~~
A few clubs were apparently wanting to sign him. I think we'd have probably been happy to wait another season before trying to sign him but the interest from other teams forced our hand a bit to move earlier.

124~~~
Castles info on Chelsea is usually spot on.

125~~~
The guys isn't going to be reading the Fuardian of Mail so it doesn't matter what the write. I don't think he's going to start for a while either.

126~~~
Modern science is amazing - now they can tell us exactly how much we overpaid for him <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.us/story/2599536/anthony-martial-deal-was-27-9m-too-much-for-united-study" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.us/story/2599536/anthony-martial-deal-was-27-9m-too-much-for-united-study</a>

127~~~
No surprise.

128~~~
To be fair I think our squad is looking very good for the future, I couldn't care how much he costs. Arsenal didn't want to over pay for a Striker this season, that could cost them the championship, surely winning trophies is the most important thing for a manager and if the board are willing to back him then great. And also for the commercial development of the club winning trophies helps immensely.

If Martial becomes an important player in a squad that goes on to win the champions league then I have no complaints.

129~~~
Very interesting. It also says we over pay for Schneiderlin but Sterling was undervalued.

130~~~
Is he likely to get a start tonight against Serbia?

131~~~
Didn't see the match, only a summary, but UEFA.com says that he came on in the 76th minute.

(Watching the summary Griezmann is really a fine player. Would love him here. Same for Matuidi on this day.)

132~~~
I love how so many supporters act like bankers or stockbrokers and complain about clubs overpaying for this or that player

They even let their appreciation of the player be swayed upon by valuation factors that had little to do with him, but with his employer

What do €27.9 million mean to Mufc in the grand scheme of things? Zilch in today's market.

133~~~
Hopefully LvG and the players protect him the best they can from this sort of shite because it'll only get worse. Wish MUTV would stop inviting that knobhead on their programmes as well.

134~~~
They are obsessed.

135~~~
The way the media are targeting the lad is starting to get pretty disgusting. You can tell they're absolutely desperate for him to fail. 

Funny how they didn't target Rooney or Shaw when we payed similar prices for them...I wonder why? Oh right, because they're English <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

136~~~
Hasn't kicked a ball for us yet, and the media have started. Disguisting.
He'll have to live with that price tag for a long while. I'd rather he lived upto it.

137~~~
If Chelsea or any other club signed him they'd be raving about him. 

Markovic cost like £25m and did feck all. 

Really can't wait for his debut.

138~~~
One year younger than Sterling, scored more goals per game for Monaco than Sterling did for Liverpool. Why exactly is Martial a waste of money? Beside not being English (obviously)?

Also, "INVESTIGATION EXPOSES" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Calm down, FBI.

139~~~
I assume that was the same independent report that the twunt Castles tweeted about earlier today.

It is absolute rubbish. It rates Sterling at €90m (£65m), which is madness and De Bruyne at only €48m (£35m) in comparison. It also rates Schneiderlin at only £18m (arguably in the top few midfielders in the league last year). Any football fan could tell you that Sterling is not worth that much and that De Bruyne is a more valuable player than him, even purely based on statistics.

Muller is only worth €35-38m according to their study. Cuadrado is worth more than Reus in their table too. Basically it is pure rubbish, but the tabloids will love it because they don't need to criticise the CIES (the people that undertook the report) but rather can criticise clubs, as it sells more papers.

We know we overpaid, but £11m value they give him is not going to buy you a highly rated young player nowadays.

140~~~
I'm sorry but City paid £17m for Roque Santa Cruz who played around 20 games for them in 3 seasons. Liverpool paid £35 for Carroll, whilst Chelsea spent £50m on Torres,  who's ability looked totally shot. And the papers are already calling Martial a 'waste of money', when he hasn't kicked a ball for us, it's so laughable the lengths they go to to have a dig at United. But this isn't grinding my gears over having a pop at United, it's at the fact they're calling Martial a waste of money, how can he be called a waste of money when he's not played a game for us yet?! I really do hope he shoves all of this back down the throats of these journalists over the next few years, the backtracking if he scores against Liverpool would be cringe worthy.

141~~~
I would not say he was a waste of money as that sensationalist headline would suggest as he has not even kick a ball for United. However, it is clear to see that we were fleeced by Monaco and if we were better prepared, we could have gotten a better deal.

Nevertheless, Martial has the ability to make his price seem more acceptable, so I would suggest it will be a mistake to jump to a conclusion with him so early. We can have a better evaluation after a few years and hopefully, if he has one poor season, we will not give up so early on him, as he can still turn it around.

His performance against Serbia. He looks to have good balance and confident going forward with the ball.

143~~~
That headline is bang out of order. Can the club show some bollicks and ban the Mirror for some time. No way they run that kind of headline when SAF was here.

144~~~
I like how multifuctional he is. Playing Martial down the middle in a false striker role seems the best way to utilize his ability. I do not believe he will do well on the right because of the assumption that he will provide pace. He is better cutting inside than providing service or crosses as a right midfielder. I am also unsure about whether he will form great chemistry with Rooney as Martial is more Sturridge, than Welbeck, I would assume. Anyway, I can not wait to see him play for United and see what kind of player he develops into.

145~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

146~~~
THIS JOB SUCKS is what I'll be saying about the next job I get.

147~~~
Why are they so obsessed with price?

If Swansea paid £20m for Marital it would be considered a coup and they'd be praised. But it would probably stick them in a bit of debt. If United have 36m to spend, it is probably a drop in an ocean, yet we have over paid?

148~~~
I can't believe how bad these journalists have become. Do they never learn? Is there not a slight chance he might go on to be great, like most of his coaches and teammates have said? Why would someone make such a premature and blind judgment, at the risk of looking like a total bellend in a short period of time?

149~~~
I like his speed, strength and directness in those clips.

Obviously a bit raw, but that will go with time and experience.

150~~~
I love the way the media hate us.

151~~~
I have absolutely no idea why anyone reads that paper. It is complete garbage. From those video's though, Martial still looks very raw. Tidy prospect though.

Because people get outraged and smash their fingers into the keyboard everywhere showing the world how outraged they are. Just ignore it.

152~~~
An important point, people shouldn't criticize the study but understand what they did, basically they looked at similar transfers in the past and added the inflation and logically Sterling is underpriced because he comes from Liverpool a rich club to City most of time these types of move are way over the market price particularly inside the english market. But Martial or De Bruyne come from league known to have reasonable prices, that's why I thought for example that Lacazette in early July would have gone for 35m€ and not 50m+ because that's the french market.
De Bruyne and Martial have been bought at prices that only correspond to the english market and therefore they are highly overpriced compared to the normal prices in their respective leagues.

153~~~
Oh how would I love it if he proves to be good just so we can stuff it down the throat of those 'journalists'. Martial shoul read that to motivate himself even more.. waste of money and hasn't kicked the ball for us yet....

154~~~
That Mirror headline is a disgrace. Martial will be fine so long as people don't expect too much from a 19 year old in his debut season. 5-6 goals max is what I'm thinking, hopefully the same amount of assists.

155~~~
The mirror answering 'how would you rate the Daily Mirror' in its sports section

156~~~
To be fair, the rumour is that Spurs pulled out after they got quoted a 16m price tag in June, before he signed his new contract.

Not too sure why the paper headline offends so many people. It's not like you're the only club to get abuse. And in this situation it is warranted - you've spent one million euro for every professional appearance the boy has had before add-ons. Let's be realistic here.

157~~~
I thought the rumour was that Spurs were rejected before he signed his new contract.

158~~~
I don't see the problem in paying for potential. The 12m we paid for Smalling was considered terrible business at the time as he'd played more games at Maidstone than anywhere else.

If Martial becomes another Freddy Adu then by all means critique. If he becomes a Neymar then it is great business. I'd personally rather my club be one that takes the risk and fails rather than one who doesn't and fails.

159~~~
I remember something like that as well. Spurs offered £20M and were rejected with the Manager responding in a press conference to make it clear that pretty much everyone at the club was up for sale <b>except</b> Martial, Bernardo Silva and a couple of others. Of course a huge fee and going out of the CL early changed that in the end.

160~~~
Of course man. But the newspapers will always criticise when they can because it generates conversation. It happens to every team. I'm sure you know that already. If Martial turns into a world beater they look silly (some of the headlines when Arsenal signed Bergkamp were really negative - I particularly remember Stuart Pearce giving a damning condemnation), if not they scream 'we told you so.'

161~~~
This place can't talk. I've never seen a forum discuss a player's transfer fee so much in my life.

162~~~
Surprised how anti-greedy he is from the little I've seen of him. Take that highlight reel of him against Serbia. A couple of times I could see a youngster of his lack of experience make the space he did and eye up the goal with a pop shot. He passes it on.

Would really like to see him play as a full on center forward. Don't mind him peeling off to the left from there as it will give our #10 and Memphis the luxury to plop forward to the middle.

163~~~
Van Gaal would be orgasming seeing that.

164~~~
Imagine if he ever ventures to the right flank, where he plays several continous pretty triangles and one-twos with Mata and Herrera (that's enough imagination already with three of them on the pitch at the same time), all of which go nowhere but look so good...and then Darmian is like 'hey guise can I join?!', before someone loses the ball and he has to chase all the way back alone <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Banning them from what ? It's not like it's ever going to stop them from writing shit articles.

167~~~
Up to Anthony now to ram it down the throats of the media.

168~~~
When Fergie was suffering from some bad press in his early days he asked Sir Matt what he should do. Matt simply said "Dont read em". He'll be looking down on Martial now offering the same piece of wisdom

169~~~
Dare I say it, he very much the type of #9 that LvG prefers. Or at least has most of the tools needed to play that way.

It's wildly uninteresting what Ray Parlour has to say.

173~~~
Yeah Keown & Parlour seem to be very much of the same boring opinion on all things United.

174~~~
Pardon?

175~~~
<i>"I think it's going to be a miss, because the money they've spent is an unbelievable amount."</i>

Non sequitur, much?

176~~~
What a waste of money, in a study conducted evaluating the British tabloids, the outcome is that The Daily Mirror is actually not worth anything but people are still paying good money to buy it!

177~~~
Whats the actual point in giving an opinion on a player that you've clearly never even seen play?

178~~~
The problem with journalists is they won't apologise or write how badly they were after a few decent performances, they'll just write an article saying how brilliant Martial is and how they saw his talent long before anyone else or any other paper.

179~~~
What an idiot. How can you claim that a 19 year old will be a flop. I think we all know he won't be playing worthy of his price in his first season in a new league, but he is 19. Give the lad a break.

180~~~

181~~~
Is Giggs sitting next to him?

edit - never mind just seen the bigger screen

182~~~
I knew Martial was probably a bit over-priced, but I didn't realise he'd be quite this bad.  What a flop... time to cut our losses and sell, I guess.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

I know it's rare these days but to balance things out from the inevitable shitstorm that is already brewing, here's a level-headed piece of sports journalism that put things into perspective.

184~~~
It's a shite article, but reel it in.

185~~~
Ay sorry about that. Bolded part a understatement.

186~~~
Did LVG actually call Giggs his successor??

187~~~
Yep. 

What happened last time when the manager choose his successor.

188~~~
Clearly said tongue in cheek.

189~~~
It's not the first time he's said he will be his successor.

190~~~
Van Gaal hasn't chosen Giggs lets make that clear.

191~~~
I didn't claim he did <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

192~~~
I'm thinking that his first start will be against Ipswich in the Carling Cup, at home. Couldn't ask for much better, really.

193~~~
Any pictures of him in training yet?

194~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> how dipperesque

Managers after van gaal succeed. 

Nothing to do with managers who chose their successors is a sure fire way to hell.

Hi, just learn't today what it is normally meant Zarlak told me. Sorry about that. Just thought it is another word for stupid as what they say where I'm from.

From the press conference, it sounds as if he won't be starting tomorrow - but possible substitute appearance?

One of the best goals against Liverpool I've seen.

Straight after Benteke's awesome overhead kick.

205~~~
Brilliant start for him. Lovely little goal too.

206~~~
I'm in love already.

207~~~
What a way to introduce yourself

208~~~
Good goal, looks like he's a good dribbler.

209~~~
Brilliant! Great for him too to get a goal on his debut, against Liverpool too.

Reminiscent of how Henry scored goals.

210~~~
I love being right about players <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> he's going to be amazing for us.

211~~~
Brilliant, like Torres at his best. Love him.

212~~~
You fecking beauty

213~~~
Are you fecking kidding me?!?!?!?!?   Holy Sh!t that was a glorious run and score from him on his debut!!!!

214~~~
What a fecking goal. This lad is special.

215~~~
Well then. That's pretty fecking fantastic.

216~~~
What a feckin debut! Thiery Henry like.

217~~~
Best moment of the season, I so want him shut everyboddy the feck up, he comes on and scores a massive goal. feck the doubters.

218~~~
That is why we paid so much money, a 19 year old kid who can do that in the arguably biggest football derby.

PS: now watch this goal everytime he will have a bad game because they will came, he needs to learn, but as he showed today he is quality.

219~~~
My heart just stopped with happiness.

A whole page of these please.

223~~~
Already done more of worth than Memphis in the league. You little beauuuuut.

224~~~
He looked like Thierry Henry there to be honest. Good run and finish.

225~~~
feck me. I screamed like a little girl <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

226~~~
That composure in front of goal.wow

227~~~
Great debut goal, but I will not rush into any conclusion until I can evaluate his season performance. Hopefully, this will give us the impetus to start him ahead of Fellaini as he looks like a more natural striker.

228~~~
We've just witnessed the first ever goal be ruined by a commentator

229~~~
Get out of here party pooper! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

230~~~
Hardest I celebrated in a long time, so fecking happy for him.

Message to the media: don't write players off when they haven't even kicked a ball, fecking twats

231~~~
GET THE feck IN!

232~~~
Look much better from left side

233~~~
What I love with that goal is there's two commentators and one of them is a united fan. It was Martin Tyler that went ape shit when he scored.

234~~~
I love him

Absolute magic, what a debut!

That was fecking incredible. What a debut for him.

I haven't screamed like that in a long time. Unbelievable Jeff.

240~~~
It's really a special moment. Not just that he is 19 and scoring on his debut but to score after all that was said about him...

241~~~
Most nuts I've gone for a goal in quite some time

My poor dogs....and neighbours

242~~~
Merci Martial. That is all.

243~~~
Such a debut. Magnificent control and composure.

Ayy <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> at Liverpoop.

244~~~
To everyone who is suprised about his face, it's who he is. So far, for every single big moment (first Monaco match, first CL match, first France match) he hasn't showed any outburst of emotion. I think he internalizes everything.

245~~~
How's that egg all over your face taste, Mirror?

246~~~
Same, went fecking mental.

247~~~
He'd make a great sniper I reckon. Pure ice in his veins

248~~~
Just watched the goal again, Fellaini's reaction when he realises it's in <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He literally doesn't know what just happened

249~~~
Ooh la la. The kid's got the Vava Voom. What a thing to do on your début. Sealing a Man Utd vs Liverpool game in front of the Stretford end.

250~~~
fecking love the guy. The intent that he showed when running into the box was already beautiful but the finish was jizz worthy.

251~~~
Excellent goal, also looked very strong and composed which can only bode well. Hopefully he can build on this performance.

252~~~
Instant hero.

274~~~
Martial United.

275~~~
I just can't stop smiling when I think it's that cnut Skrtl he humiliated with his move.

276~~~
That's the most excited Martin Tyler has got about a United goal since Macheda's.

277~~~
It reminded me of the Macheda goal. 
He did the little gesture with his left hand when Young had the ball asking it to be played away from goal. Macheda did the same when Giggs had the ball.
The finish was in the same corner as well. Both on their debuts coming on as subs around the hour mark on the day we didnt have strikers (rooney was injured that day too)

The Macheda goal was a lot LOT more important though

278~~~
Good man, that's a dream debut! Skrtel might need some counseling after being done that dirty.

279~~~
Classic Henry finish as well, he didn't do well to shake off the comparisons <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

280~~~
Get the feck in. A striker that can get past defenders and finish. I've been asking for that for years, I hope he continues to play like he obviously naturally plays.

281~~~
Tyler's commentary<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Brilliant!

282~~~
Dream debut. Attacked the space!

283~~~
Just seen the goal again & it's probably the most excited Tyler's been for a United goal since Macheda's goal.

284~~~
Martin Tyler's commentary almost makes it a macheda moment

feckign amazing

I've just watched it ten more times

285~~~
Superb. I need to watch the goal again with the commentary<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

286~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Unbelievable

287~~~
I'm actually going to watch Sky's analysis just to see them squirm (Henry aside)

288~~~
We underpaid by about 100m eh <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

289~~~
Yeah, can see from where the Henry comaprison comes.

290~~~
Trying not to get too hyped for this lad but if this is a taste of what's to come... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

293~~~
Wonderful goal & a good start for him.

Right in the face of all the haters

Still talking about my price feckers?

297~~~
Even if you'd never heard it before that run and the side footed finish into the corner would make you see it.

What a debut, eh?

298~~~
I hope that shuts up all the wanna be accountants with their theories on why the transfer is over priced. 

Who cares ? Id rather have that money being overspent on players than being overspent on dividends.

301~~~
Wasn't it just? The quick dribbling past his man and placing it in the far corner. Even the expression-less look on his face when he celebrated (in the huddle). Although it wasn't a look of nonchalance, he can't do that just yet, more of a down to earth "not-getting-ahead-of-myself-here" look.

302~~~
Watch the goal again. No fear and put it into the corner

303~~~
Great start for the player, huge boost of confidence for him. Was absolutely delighted after the commentary when he scored, was a bit hilarious<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. We should not overhype him though, he has a long way to go..

304~~~
Best thing about him was that he looked so composed, like he played 10000 matches before and just couldn't give a shit. Like you took the most cool kid from the street and put him on the pitch, you can't get a better debut than that really.

305~~~
I genuinely think he has the same high ceiling of potential that young Ronaldo and Rooney has shown at about same age.

306~~~
36M? Bargain!! What a fecking goal, and something we've missed - directness.

Seriously though, I just hope the fans don't expect too much from him. We can't expect that from him every week, and he probably will be a bit inconsistent because he's a young player, but today we all saw what he can produce.

307~~~
That goal on its own, honestly to me, makes his price tag worth it.

What composure, technical ability, and intent he showed in running at the Liverpool defence and calmly tucking it past the Mingolet, right in front of the Stretford end.

Take a bow son, welcome to Manchester United. May you have a long and illustrious career with us.

308~~~
That's exactly how he is which is fantastic considering his age and how easy it'd be for him to be ecstatic about his life right now.

309~~~
If we needed proof that Ray parlour is shit, then this is it

310~~~
He knows that commentary will be rerun for years to come, just like the Rooney one <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

311~~~
Great post mate, sums it up perfectly.

312~~~
It's for moments like these that I watch football.

Almost gave my wife and cat a heart attack though.

313~~~
Same here. I went proper ape shit. What a way to shut the doubters up.

314~~~
What a goal! 50m will look like a steal hehe

315~~~
I love this kid.

316~~~
A couple of points.

As it seemed from the clips, he looks very powerful for a 19 year old. The moment when Lovren kept trying to kick shits out of him and still couldn't get the ball highlighted this. This is something we've needed from a striker for awhile now and it bodes well for us and him.

Also, it's just one game, but he doesn't look lacking in self belief to me. Seems to be a calm young and confident young man.

317~~~
young: "It doesn't matter if Martial doesn't speak English if that's how speaks on the pitch.

318~~~
Feck me more goals than Wayne Rooney in the league <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

319~~~
Delighted for the lad as that goal will have done his confidence a world of good and could even have a bearing on his impact this season.
If he had come on and done poorly tonight then there would be cries of "not ready yet", whereas now I doubt anyone would have qualms with him starting.

In addition to the goal, his piece of holdup play with Lovren fouling him was fantastic, because it spoke volumes about his character. He didnt go over, he kept on fighting and competing, when it may have been easier to buckle or shrink away. Aside from his goal that was honestly the highlight of his debut for me.

320~~~
Cantona said we got him cheap. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

321~~~
Getting fecking goosebumps watching this again. Absolutely amazing moment. Very happy for Martial.

322~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Love the fact that Martin Tyler doesn't even try to hide who he was supporting. "Ohhhh yesssssss!".

323~~~
If Memphis gets his finger out the potential movement between the two could be frightening

324~~~
It's like he heard all the comparisons to Henry and thought 'now that's an idea'.

325~~~
I'd swear I have seen Henry score identical goals

Especially the actual finish

326~~~
The kid's mentality is immense. This is the biggest game of our season, every season. Liverpool had just got back into it with a brilliant goal. The press have been droning on about his price tag all through the international break. He gets the ball in a decent area with a lot to do, and despite all the pressure, he ghosts past the Liverpool defence like they're not there and finishes as if it were a training game. Ooh la la. Martial has a whole truck load of Vava Voom.

327~~~
Martin Tyler's commentary was reminiscent of his reaction when Aguero banged in that goal against QPR in injury time which won them the PL a few years ago.

Irony.

328~~~
...Did that actually happen?

329~~~
I can't believe he wasn't booked for that.

330~~~
Always thought he was a Liverpool fan

331~~~
I've rewatched that 17 second clip of his goal 20 times already in a row.

332~~~
Can't stop watching that clip. Martin Tyler you legend.

333~~~

334~~~
It was Henryesque, the change in direction and corner placement

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wTAPLYHRSio?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

335~~~
Yep.

The finish curled finish in to the corner is bordering on plagiarism but the way he does Skrtel, as well, is very reminiscent of that infuriatingly good bloke.

336~~~
He's done more wearing that number 9 in half an hour than Falcao did all season. A proper United kind of signing.

337~~~
I love how the pitch of the "Yes" rises as the ball bulges into the net..great goal..great moment..

338~~~
I was so happy he scored. I feel for the boy, he was branded a flop before he even got a chance to kick the ball. Disgusting

339~~~
Martin Tyler sure knows how to pick a moment. 

Guaranteed this will be used in many Sky adverts to come in the future.

340~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>..That was also against the Scousers..great goal.

341~~~
1/25 of the way to that big bonus payment for goals scored. And a fraction closer to the Ballon D'Or.

Woodward, you fecking beautiful balding genius.

342~~~
He's just answered his critics in the best possible way. High pressure game and classy debut goal. Didn't even seem fazed by the occasion. He's highly rated for a reason and i'll love to see him make the doubters eat their words. 

Say something about that transfer fee now?!

343~~~
What a way to start his United career! Superb first goal.

344~~~
Yes, hopefully in a montage of similarly great goals by Martial in the future..The fact that its against them just makes it so much sweeter..

345~~~
It's disappeared. Someone find another

346~~~
nice goal

347~~~
Glad he scored. Beyond the obvious reasons it also instantly shut up the swooning over the Benteke goal.

348~~~
F'cking welled up la!

Delighted for the lad. Disgusting criticism thrown at him in the media

349~~~
I'm still struggling to process it. Perhaps if I watch it another 15 or so times it'll sink in.

350~~~

Shut up everyone

351~~~
If it feeds the scouse conspiracy theory machine thus making the  RAWK meltdown  even better, I wont be complaining.

352~~~
I've tried. Doesn't work.

353~~~

354~~~
Good idea.

355~~~
I'm still in shock. What a debut. Hope he makes more of this start than Macheda did, I think he will.

356~~~
Try 40. My heartrate is still way too fast.

357~~~
No orgasmic commentary here, but here is the goal itself

358~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

And I love it.

360~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I've only just stopped shaking.

361~~~
Fecking incredible! I went crazy!

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/eFnOUwL9we0/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

364~~~
At the beginning he seems a bit spaced out but then he got a bit involved, one or two touches, and then that goal! Brilliant

BTW: after that goal of course the Henry comparisons will come out even harder

365~~~
They didnt

366~~~
Okay that was Henry-esque

367~~~
He just had to score with a dribble cutting in from the left, with a side foot finish. 

For 19, he looks solid as feck. Him and Shaw are the strongest looking 19 year olds I know.

368~~~
Let's just hope LVG doesn't out- train" that risky dribbling stuff <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

369~~~
Absolutely delighted.  OT was buzzing louder than I have heard in ages when that goal flew into the bottom corner.  Dream debut.

370~~~
What a way to introduce yourself! The fact the goal was so Henry-esqe will do nothing to help him shake off the "New Henry" label he's gotten.

371~~~
Just by that goal alone we'll now be going into every match buzzing with excitement and belief that we'll see something incredible from a truly special talent. It's a great feeling. I can't remember the last substitute we had that created that kind of instant excitement. It'd be amazing if he broken into the starting XI.

372~~~
Fantastic goal; before the long term comparisons to henry start to dwell; he needs to learn how to do the same on the right. 

Thats why he will start along on the right hand side IMO.

373~~~

Incredibly well-taken goal. Amazing composure and finish.

383~~~
I loved his celebration running infront of the Stretford End. He must have felt like such a boss!

384~~~
I really like the way he carries himself, from the snippets I've seen on YouTube and today he has great composure and confidence. I liked it when Lovren was trying to give it to him on the halfway line and he held it up as if to say 'is that all you've got pal?' As with Memphis we'll have to take the rough with the smooth but it was a beautiful moment.

385~~~
Put him in my fantasy team after the transfer went through. Heard LVG's conference saying he'll be eased in, so didn't expect him actually play and took him out for Gomis.

Fantastic goal though.

386~~~
He is very muscular and physically pronounced for a 19 year old.  Imagine how big he'll be once he's properly filled out - A beast like Drogba with the finesse of Henry?

387~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

388~~~
I think that he will be like Lewandowski.

389~~~
Good on him, but don't get too excited. He wasn't great, bad touch seen him hounded by pool players who were clumsy enough to give away a cheap foul and hehad a lucky break for the goal.


Feck, who am I kidding. Get in there!!!

390~~~
I made my wife watch his goal and told her to remember this day, it could be the birth of a United Legend.

391~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

392~~~
Never heard Gary Neville when he scored. Must have been up celebrating like the rest of us. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

393~~~
Repeat this for whole season and we are champions. Make it your routine before every united game.

394~~~
Wow!

395~~~
Lots of Henry comparisons, but that goal reminded me most of Suarez, especially how he got through the two defenders.

396~~~
Henry used to do that all the time. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

397~~~
A Man Utd sticker that can beat players and create for himself. How long?

398~~~
I didn't even notice the commentary when I was watching the game because I was going so crazy, brilliant <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

399~~~
Long road ahead but wow that moment of brilliance is exactly why we pay to watch football. Fighting very hard to guard against over excitement and unrealistic expectations but if the truth be told a player who can do that on the ball is exactly what we are missing.

Many will say that it's just one goal, and there's a long road ahead, but just look at Shaw. Hardly much older and doing it week in week out. If you have the talent, it doesn't matter.

407~~~
Yep. 

All this talk of Blind is going to have a nightmare against Benteke.
Herrera deserves a start
Martial silencing all his doubters

409~~~
Yeah the there is also Rooney, Fabregas and Ronaldo who have been doing it since they were 16/17. If his performances warrant it then play him, if you are good enough your certainly old enough.

410~~~
Anthony Martial is the 1st Man Utd player since 1936 to score on his debut in a league fixture vs Liverpool.

411~~~
Not bad.

412~~~

413~~~
Loved it when he was waiting on the sideline for Mata to exit the pitch and he was stood there looking up at each stand, seemingly soaking in the atmosphere and the occasion. 

I also enjoyed the way he stood up Lovren when he tried to bully him and just held him off with his strength. 

The goal will obviously be the focus, and quite right too, but there was other encouraging stuff as well.

414~~~
McDonnell. Absolutely garbage journalism which is pretty much the norm these days.

Anyway, what a goal and what a moment.

415~~~
That was very encouraging. Wasn't phased by it at all.

416~~~
I gave him 10/10, silly I know but that little bit of footwork and finish got me out of my seat and to do it in such a big game on your debut at 19 after Liverpool had just pulled a goal back showed great composure, really pleased for him after the last couple of weeks of utter bullshit from the dregs of the media.

417~~~
He has everything, he is powerful, he has pace and mentally strong.

418~~~
Definitely, LvG noted it in his post-match interview as well, saying he showed him he can play in the PL.

419~~~
When a striker is played a pass down the channels and manages to shape up against the defender and get him to back off and essentially go on the backfoot, then that's a great sign for me. It shows that the player has pace and skill, and it's something that we have lacked in our strikers for a long time. The kind of thing you see very often from Aguero, Suarez, Benzema, Torres (of old) etc. How he fairs will depend on his application, but we can use the natural ability here and now and I love seeing it.

420~~~
He looks like the kid from Everybody Hates Chris

421~~~
It's time to relax about this though. I'm extremely happy for the kid and we've seen glimpses of his potential, but he also received an opportunity in this game, some space to take his man on and show off his great strengths on the ball and he took it. Kudos to him for having the balls to pull it off, but I think we'll still have to be patient with the kid and let him develop.

422~~~
It took a season of refinement at United for him to be as great as he is this year. Shaw has worked his ass off to get to the consistent level he's at now.

423~~~
He's gone from a half-dead stadium to 75,000+. That, alone, before anything else is even considered is an insane amount of upheaval for a 19yr old. You would think it'll take him some time to settle and truly feel at home, but it really didn't look like it whilst he was out there. He internalises well because he looks un-phased even if he's bricking it inside.

It struck me that he doesn't actually play like a centre forward as he drifted extremely wide on both sides of the pitch. Is that normal for him, because if it is, if he's to lead the line, you need a player behind him that can occupy his position when he goes walkabout. 

It seems custom-made for Rooney to assume the #10 role that might temporarily have him right up top when Martial's off down a flank. 

He also looks like he has the legs and the running to make whoever plays at #10 behind him have a much easier ride in terms of their own movement.

It will be good to see him get more game time. He looks a real talent.

424~~~
I'm tempted to buy his jersey due to the euphoria but I've learned my lesson after buying falcao and di Maria jersey last season.

425~~~
Loved the bit, where he wasn't bothered by Lovren.

426~~~
Went mental when scored that goal! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

It doesn't change the fact that he is young and everything is very new for him and he has to adapt, won't expect him to do that every game from now on or anything like that, he will frustrate us fans alot and that is expected.

427~~~
He doesn't write headlines and it's a study that says we overpaid not the journalist.

428~~~
Buy Silva and Aguero jerseys and send it to kids in Africa.

429~~~
Ive been struggling for a while to have a favourite player in our new look squad .... and have decided today it shall be Martial.  Might even buy his shirt to use when I play for my Sunday team!

430~~~
I don't think many people are expecting of him to replicate such heights in every single game at such a young age, but it's fecking exciting having such a player in our team. 

Watching a young player with amazing potential stun the world and make a name for himself at Manchester United - that's why we all became fans in the first place. It's one of the most exciting things in football. Even though we can't expect him to replicate such heights in every single game due to his tender age, I can't fecking wait to watch him again on Tuesday! 

There will be ups and downs, but even after Di Maria's bright start last season, I wasn't really as excited to watch him play as I am with Martial. Leaving the transfer fee aside, there's always much more excitement with the younger players that are still developing, but can make an immediate impact in the first team as well. Waching a young player taking the world by storm at Manchester United just like Ronaldo did - that's what it's all about IMO. Hopefully Martial will become a great player for us, the potential is there for all to see.

431~~~
Very true. Also he was a little lucky how the ball fell when dribbling but he did tuck it away well

432~~~
cant stop watching it.

433~~~
Fans singing "What a waste of money!" after he scored. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Just an amazing goal!

434~~~
I hope he starts the next match. I think we should just keep playing Martial and Depay even if they have dodgy performances. It's exciting watching young talented players improve and I'd rather have it over Rooney and Young.

435~~~
was on the road and missed the 2nd half. wow.........what a goal from martial. walked in there and scored like there was no one there. brilliant!

436~~~
lol

437~~~
I keep watching the goal, man, it's fecking phenomenal. He made Skrtel his bitch <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The pace, the timing, the dribbling, the composure. It's just perfect. The guy has nerves of steel! 

I also don't buy the ''slightly lucky'' comments just because Skrtel had the slightest of touches on the ball when Martial was humiliating him. If we go by that logic, there's luck in every single goal scored...ever.

438~~~
How can you say that when young pretty much single handedly changed how the game played out? 
He came on and changed the game in our favour

Memphis was complete trash today he did nothing and lost the ball more times than I could count, he should be dropped and young deserves his place back in the team. I would love to keep martial in the team though.

439~~~
I can't see us winning the title this year. May as well develop Depay and Martial for next season. Young's been here for 4/5 years so it's not surprising that he's better than Depay right now but I would be really disappointed if Depay doesn't end up far surpassing him in talent.

440~~~
Absolutely stoked he's got a goal on debut, sounds like it was a real romper as well. I am glad he wasn't completely thrown in the deep end and that has to be good for the confidence of him and the players.

441~~~

442~~~
Now we see why there is comparisons with Henry

443~~~
I could watch that goal all day, it's one of the best debut goals I've seen. Lets hope he will remain grounded and produce plenty more moments of sheer brilliance like that. I've not been that excited when we've scored since that RVP volley vs Villa which won us the league.

444~~~
Sorry to be the party pooper again, but can we give this lad some reasonable expectation. Those making hyperbolic claims are no worse than those making sensationalist headlines or comment. He scored a great goal on his debut, but his career will not be defined by this moment. Let him enjoy his football and be known as Martial right now before putting so much expectation on him.

445~~~
Looks like he has very good technique.

446~~~
Hence the Henry resemblances. Henry was known for the fact that he was played of the left wing rather than a true strikers position.

447~~~
Fantastic goal. We haven't seen a goal like that in a long while.

448~~~
Quite a small detail but I loved how when Young had the ball he pointed exactly where he wanted it and his first thought was to attack Skrtel and tie him in knots. So so so refreshing to see a United striker fashion a chance for themselves and the finish wasn't half bad either, we see players all the time, especially young ones, blast it at the keeper or over the bar from that position.

Thought that hold up play vs Lovren was also a joy to watch, overall throughly impressed by that cameo. Like people have mentioned let's keep grounded but a brilliant debut nonetheless.

449~~~
Memphis' first was pretty special as well.

450~~~
This lad made my day, "It's Martial you know, hard to believe it's not Cole"

451~~~
Lethal attack and finish.  Direct, deliberate and at pace.  I would love to see him or ked in just like that: late to exploit he space in teams chasing the game and run right at their defense.

452~~~
Martial Manhunter of the Premier League

<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/eFngAmA020L/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

454~~~
Not really. His technique is sublime. He seems to be more of a Henry and less to a Cole

455~~~
Anyone know who passed it to Young for Martial's goal? I can't remember he sequence of events...

456~~~
One thing I noticed in his highlights is that he is great at his age in terms of choosing what to do (drive at players, cross the ball, take a shot) and then making sure he does it. Didn't hesitate today after he started going at Skrtel, and kept his cool the whole time. Exciting start, can't wait for more. Once Memphis gets going, on the other wing, look out.

457~~~
Schweinsteiger.

458~~~
How did he do it? Just two weeks ago he was playing atop a car park for 5,000 fans.

459~~~
I have it on good authority from threads in the football forum that he detests United but creams himself over Liverpool goals... and City goals... and Chelsea goals.

The ABU twat...

460~~~
Lets be honest here, he just loves creaming himself.

Who can blame him?

461~~~
I'm positively giddy at the prospect of Martial and Wilson being our long term strike partnership. If both progress as expected, they will literally have everything!

462~~~
He just realized that he owes 19 years of alimony.

463~~~
Or, you know... loves football and is paid to provide commentary that helps you give a damn about it?

464~~~
Being overly harsh, I think he got a bit lucky when the ball bounced between his feet, but the coolness of the finish was pure class.

465~~~
Well yeah, that's basically my point...

466~~~
Oh boy <img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

467~~~
+ the most important thing, he looked where Mignolet was positioned before shooting.

468~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

469~~~
Just after watching the post match videos there and didn't notice the finish in detail until Henry gave his views on it. One thing that he mentioned which I was oblivious to was in the middle of the fast dribbling and in the blink of an eye after beating Skrtel he looks straight at the keeper and his movement before placing the ball without even looking where he was striking it. 

That's the type of finishing brilliance of RVN or Henry. Lets hope he becomes as good as either of those greats.

470~~~
He seems very mature. Unlike Sterling. I'm sure Pogba said something about his maturity. 19 and already a dad.

471~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

472~~~
What's ABU?

473~~~
Apart from the goal, there was a time on the right wing, where one of the liverpool defenders tried to bully him off the ball but Martial wasnt having any of it. He stood his ground and ended up winning a free kick. Almost as good as the goal.

474~~~
Anyone but United.

475~~~
Yeah, was against Lovren that. Martial seems like he could be physically able to cope with the league which is great.

476~~~
It was the big donkey Lovren. Should have been booked for it

477~~~
Very pleased for him. What a stage to introduce yourself.

478~~~
Haha, was thinking it was, but was waiting to watch highlights to confirm. But you guys did anyway.

I like what im seeing from Martial, it was the right move to bring him on as a sub in this match imo. We need to use him sorta like Fergie used Ronaldo his first season

479~~~
Yeah, a lovely piece of distribution it was too, after bringing it down on his chest.

480~~~
Considering its his first week I can see the logic in benching him. But going forward we should use him as a starter over the likes of Fellaini instead of sub appearances imo. Rooney and Ronaldo at 19 were starting matches every week for us I think

481~~~
Worth every penny that lad.

482~~~
Good to see a United striker with pace, mobility, with a decent finish. He also has a level of arrogance about him.

483~~~
I'm pretty sure he meant it. Even I could do that 10 years ago.

484~~~
Balls, he looked down and was surprised/happy. End finish was main thing for me though. Class.

485~~~
A great debut goal!  A wonderful dribble and finish at an important time, in a big game against a bitter rival. I love that he had the confidence to pick the ball up and just drive at the heart of the Liverpool defence. It'll definitely be a big boost for the boy. We shouldn't expect too much too soon off the back of one goal, but you can see why the club rated him so highly. He just may play a bigger role this season than most of us expected. I look forward to watching him develop.

486~~~
Great goal, had the confidence to dribble and go for goal which is like Depay. Really hope he starts soon.

487~~~
I can't be fecked reading through 7 pages or so, so I just wanna say: <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

Great finish. Made me laugh a bit at the Welbeck comparisons I saw because despite me being a Welbeck fan, that finish was ice-cold.

488~~~
Solo goal against Liverpool on your debut? 36 million? Bargain. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

489~~~

(Literally just been able to watch the game having avoided the score all day)

490~~~
I thought was his little trick to get past Skrtel.

491~~~
I have to say, thats probably the most I've celebrated a goal in the post Fergie era.

THAT was everything Manchester United should be about. And I for one, have missed that kind of genius on the pitch. 

I also loved the way he celebrated. He has that air of arrogance, he knows how good he is.

492~~~
Genuinely can't stop watching this. Tylers commentary <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

493~~~
With Rooney out injured for the PSV match, can Martial play considering he played in the CL qualifiers against Valencia?

494~~~
Yeah, it's grand. Resets after qualifiers.

495~~~
It's been long since I have seen a United striker do that. What a way to make a debut. Too early to say anything but I hope he keeps banging us these goals. Great bit of confidence booster for the lad!

496~~~
He just looks so calm and composed.

497~~~
Everything about the goal was great. When he gets the ball, he positions himself perfectly to take on Skrtel. Then he attacks with Skrtel with confidence. Bamboozles him and then the finish to match. The finish was truly Henry-like. 

Hopefully he continues to bang them in.

498~~~
Anyone have the reverse camera angle for the goal? I'd love to see it.

499~~~
In a way it tells you how fecking average Liverpool's defense has become, for Martial to come and take the piss like that in his first match.

500~~~
I think ESPN might have it here

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.us/barclays-premier-league/23/video/2608257/watch-spectacular-debut-goal-from-martial" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.us/barclays-premi...257/watch-spectacular-debut-goal-from-martial</a>

If it doesn't load right away, refresh the page.

501~~~
He's killed the Welbeck comparisons in one fell swoop. That finish was an ice cold strikers finish.

502~~~
Aye. Very encouraging that the occasion didn't faze him at all.

503~~~
Nice, thank you. There's never been a goal that I thought I need more camera angles like this one. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

504~~~
Cheers!

505~~~
I actually can't stop watching the clip <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Haven't felt like that in a long time. Hopefully he continues like that and I don't mean just by scoring goals, I mean getting supporters excited and taking men on and beating them with pace and skill.

United need players like that. The club deserves players like that

506~~~
Great debut - showing strength, pace and skill today. I hope he keeps it up!

507~~~
Great start from him, he can still become both a boom or a bust but no matter what he has earned himself a place in our hearts with a great goal against Liverpool. To be honest it is impressive to come on at Old Trafford, against our biggest rival and play/behave the way he did at 19 years old

If he becomes a star everyone will say that this is where it started.

508~~~
So, has the Mirror apologised for the "what a waste of money" headline?

509~~~
I like everything about his game... pace, strength, dribbling, technique, finishing, composure, confidence and coolness.

510~~~
Right, because Skrtel truly is one of the worst defenders in the Premier League...

Looking forward for him to meet a Terry on decline!

511~~~
That defending was one of the worst of the season definitely. It doesn't mean what Martial did wasn't fantastic. The pb criticizing what Skrtl did is always gonna be seen as underrating what Martial which isn't the case at all. Martial is that kinda dribbler.

512~~~
He already has more PL goals than Rooney (this season) <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Anyway, the last 2 times I got so excited about a  player on debut was Ronaldo and Kiko Macheda (AVL).  Hoping this is in the territory of the first <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

513~~~
I hope for the former too. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

514~~~
Just saw his goal, woah what a tasty piece of dribbling and he absolutely torched Skertel. Martin Tyler above <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>! eeEYEEEEEEEEEEEEEES

515~~~
So so glad for the lad! What a debut,what a way to introduce yourself!<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

516~~~
Will be interesting to see how he and Memphis work together. 

They do like to occupy similar space.

517~~~
He looked a different class to Memphis I felt. We need to see more to judge properly, but he's done it at Monaco already, played at the highest level and he's only 19. Looks like he has a fantastic attitude too - level headed. I like the future up front with him.

518~~~
LVG is the ideal manager for him in this situation. He'll ease him into things. He probably won't start any game outside the League cup for a while.

519~~~
He should start against PSV midweek.

520~~~
Judas!!!!!!

521~~~
Seems unlikely to me.

522~~~
You can see what a great squad we have from his match highlight video, our players bombarded him when he scored, Herrera even gave him a little skin on skin just for drawing the foul from Lovren. With LVG as manager,  he really is at the right place to flourish.

523~~~
Why if Rooney isn't fit, there's no-one else. Martials done it in the CL before against better teams than PSV.

524~~~
Quite. He should start. Memphis too, given it's a return home.

525~~~
I'd forgotten that fact, wonder whether LvG will start him because of that. I'd taken Memphis out of my starting lineup prediction, I feel he really needs a rest now, he looks a bit jaded.

526~~~
Normally I would drop him too, but not for a return to where he made his name. You'd hope he'd want to remind the fans of what they now miss and a good performance in this situation might help his confidence. I'd have him on the bench for the next league game though.

527~~~
Dream debut!

528~~~
I don't know, after all the criticism- come on and score a brilliant goal against Liverpool under the Stretford End. The lad is blessed....

However, remember he's a kid. Dream start, yes but that's all it is. Expect inconsistency, that's what a lot of kids produce. A fantastic goal yes, a dream debut yes, but if he doesn't score next game or the game after or the game after then don't be surprised.

The kid has shown he's got talent but look at Memphis these last 2 games...it's a very unforgiving environment. Don't expect him to score goals like that every week or you'll be thoroughly disappointed. Class goal yesterday though, great start to his United career.

529~~~
The essence of youth. Had that been Rooney, He would have gone to the corner flag to waist time or passed it back to Young. Skertel wasn't ready for Martial to run at him, that hit him with a surprise.

530~~~
He has given us something we have missed from our strikers, someone who can make defenders think twice, he is direct he is a big player, and he is a different option to what we have got. We will see mistakes from him, but its made me happy we have got a striker with strength pace to get at defenders, which fans have been crying out for ages. When we face chelsea, guys like him could rip terry to pieces if he comes on has an impact sub

531~~~
Memphis has been very good in both CL games so far.

532~~~
His goal is the kind of threat I have been talking about for months that you expect with top strikers. Make defenders defend. All summer I read 'if Rooney plays up front, in an attacking team, with two good wingers providing service, he will get goals'. That’s all well and good, but top strikers make things happen. I wouldn't constitute Young's pass to Martial as 'service '.

533~~~
Excellent goal yesterday.

534~~~
Excellent goal, the stuff that gets you on the edge of the seat. The fact alone that he ran at Skrtel made me smile, then going easily past him with that perfect finish <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

535~~~
I just can't stop watching the goal, I can't remember the last time I celebrated like I did...

536~~~
I think we all went overly mental because it's been so long since we seen an individual moment of class like that from one of our own. Depay in the Champions League perhaps, but this was so much bigger. It was Mattial' debut, at Old Trafford and it was against the scouse bastards.

537~~~
I've watched him a few times now and I've never failed to be impressed by his dribbling. I honestly think there's nobody in England who's better than him at keeping close control whilst running at pace. Sure, there are some fantastic technicians in the PL, but Martial combines that with the kind of speed which terrifies defenders. Reminds me of prime Kaka. Or possibly even Henry if I was a racist.

538~~~
Deserves to start next weekend. What a debut, it'll be talked about for years.

539~~~
Not disputing that, but I think he deserves a rest. Would be a shame to burn him out too soon in the season.

540~~~
I don't know what it is about him, whether it's arrogance or quiet confidence but he just didn't seem to be fazed from playing in front of 5,000 at Monaco to 70,000 at United - added to the fact that he was thrown into a Liverpool game. I think he's born to be a star.

He'll be much more heavily marked in subsequent games but given time he will become world class, I'm sure.

541~~~
With the way he plays (drifting out wide) it will be nice to see Rooney in that number 10 position behind Martial, as he'd be able make late runs down the middle, which is where he gets most of his goals from. 

I'd also like to see him on the wing too, as, like we all saw yesterday, he's got great dribbling ability and directness, especially on the left wing, where he can cut onto his right.

542~~~
Personally thought if he hadn't scored then it would've been a typical deer in the headlights young kid performance but I suppose everyone is going to use the goal to gloss over that. In this instance though with it being such a good goal and after all the pressure and writing off of him that people have been doing, it's great that it happened and he's getting plaudits.

543~~~
Martial ahead of Rooney should be interesting. Drifting to the right will allow Mata to tuck inside and Rooney to push forwards; sounds good to me.

544~~~
Rooney will play through the middle if anything it will be Martial in front of Mata or Depay

545~~~
So basically if you ignore all the good things he did, it becomes an average performance? Makes sense...

546~~~
Can't see Rooney getting a game in midfield. We've also been playing Herrera at 10 with both Depay and Mata available, can't see why that will change.

547~~~
You mean the one good thing he did?

548~~~
Sometimes it only takes one special moment to have a fantastic game, that's what distinguishes the great players from the good ones, you cant just discount that in his performance yesterday.

549~~~
It was a better piece of individual play than any of our other players have come up with in the league. The fact that you try to make out it is being used to 'gloss over' the rest of his performance is laughable. He was tidy in possession the other times he got the ball so I would say that for a 30 minute appearance in his first game at a new club, in a new country, playing in one of the biggest games in club football worldwide, it was a pretty good debut.

550~~~
Lots of players can do the run without the finish. That was an important goal and it shows the fans, that he's got good movement and can finish things off. It's never easy coming on as a substitute but he did the most important thing.

551~~~
People keep mentioning the size of Monaco crowd, but he has played in other stadiums before!

552~~~
He also held up the ball well on multiple occasions. He wasn't exactly swamped for service. I mean c'mon - the lad barely misplaced a pass - how is that "deer in the headlights".

553~~~
Thought the same when I first saw it tbh

<a class="externalLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=15&amp;v=o1rg35vLrLA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=15&amp;v=o1rg35vLrLA</a>

554~~~
I don't think Wilson will be here in 3 years. He certainly doesn't have anywhere near the same level of potential as Martial. 

Has anyone mentioned yet that it was a very Torres-like finish? I mean Torres in his prime of course.

555~~~
Nah he is still to young to say he will not make it here.

556~~~
Jokingly, when all the Henry comparisons were made, I said for that money he better bloody well do that cutting-in-from-the-left-and-curling-it-round-the-keeper type of goal that I always hated Henry doing. Then yesterday happened <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

557~~~
He looked very calm and evem a touch arrogant when he put his foot on the ball and laughed at Lovren's big bully attempts to get it off of him. He also held up the ball well 2 tomes out of 4 times he touched the ball before the goal. The other two times he he 'lost it' it was from a challenge for a header and 2 or three opposition players swarming around him. He basically did something amazing the first time he got a yard of space.

Deer in the headlights indeed.

558~~~
Aye, he had a good game before the goal, the goal took it to great. 
No. Stop.

559~~~
Just a feeling to be honest. Wouldn't put him in the same bracket as Martial for now

BTW getting Martial instead of Pedro could prove to be a masterstroke a'la Ronaldo instead of Ronaldinho (and Duff and Cole) in 2003.

560~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Now do one that compares Fellaini and Pele.

561~~~
Brilliant goal, brilliant debut. I don't think he'll start, when Rooney's fit again, but he is a great option to bring on if we're looking for a goal. For now. We can obviously also drop Rooney deeper and play him behind Martial as well if needs be. One thing that might count against him is his walking about, or even standing still, when the balls not around. If we're chasing a game, i can see fans getting frustrated with that. Great introduction though.

562~~~
I can see him thriving here if given the chance. His raw attributes and his all round game are perfectly suited to the League, and while he may or may not be on Martial's level, he is still a damn good finisher with an all round game to be any defender's nightmare. Him and Martial could be the perfect strike partnership, the likes of which we haven't seen since Saha and Rooney and Yorke and Cole before them.

563~~~
Sorry I never made that post clear! I meant Martial will play before Mata.

564~~~
Just going to summarise my observations of him from the debut:

Positives
Fantastic run for the goal
Showed he can finish
Strong hold up play (I think when lovren tried to tackle him)
Seemed to like to start from wide positions

Negatives
Wasn't involved much when he came on which may have been due to the state of the game when introduced. He seemed to have limited touches
Not quite as quick as I thought he would be, maybe he was but just didn't seem it

565~~~
Hmm. Like a naked guy who bursts into a room where an orgy finished hours before, and now everyone is sitting around, fully dressed, drinking tea and talking about their favourite movies.

566~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

567~~~
Shoddy work in not having his banner updated with his stats. <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/> <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

568~~~
Yup, just saw the full replay. Excellent volleyed pass.

569~~~
The highlights in MOTD didn't do him justice for those who didn't watch the full game - especially when the commentator said something about it being his first touches of the game. The reality is that his hold up play was really good before his goal and he showed a lot of strength and composure when he needed to shield the ball.

570~~~
Can't believe I missed this moment as I was at a friend's wedding. Selfish prick!

Seeing the score update did make my heart flutter a little though.

571~~~
I think the banner and stuff updates once the MOTM/player rating voting closes.

572~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

573~~~
We really gave up playing football after the second goal. He came in the game when the team shutdown mentally so he didn't have much to get involved with. 

He has this face that just looks confident and unfazed. De Gea has a similar face, you just look at them and think "yep this guys knows what he is doing".

574~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

575~~~
Id like to think a show like MOTD is very redundant nowadays when it comes to evaluating a players game. About 2/3 hours after a game is done, you can go on youtube and search "player X Vs Team Y" and a highlight video of that players every touch will be there. Great times to be alive in!

576~~~
Indeed. We've discovered the secrets of DNA, eradicated smallpox, landed a man on the moon __ and now this!

577~~~
To me the landing of the Moon is less important than being able to watch a game a couple of hours after he has been played.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

This is a great video

<i>"Manchester United fans, I've not heard them cheer as loud as that - I know it's against Liverpool but there was a huge relief around the stadium. It was a big, big moment for a player making his debut. He'd been written off, almost, in some quarters in the last couple of weeks, before he'd started." - Gary Neville

The celebrations after the goal were absolutely mental. Everyone just exploded, there were people all over the place just piled on top of eachother. I'd love to see a fans reaction video as it goes in. These are the best moments in football for me.</i>

580~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/74pd" width="560"></iframe>
He meant it

0:36

At full speed it looks flukey but slowed down you can see he has his eyes on the ball and adjusts his torso to push the ball forward with his left foot.

581~~~
First thing I thought when seeing that goal was 'Henry'. That really was a magical moment. Hope he starts on Tuesday.

582~~~
Does anyone else think it looks like he's very quickly pointed to the near post with his left hand just before he strikes the ball to put the keeper off in the 3rd replay?

583~~~
I hope so. It's the sort of thing Suarez does regularly with great success. If it's something Martial can do regularly then it'll be clear it's skill, but it's hard to tell from just one occasion.

584~~~
There's no way you can have seen either player extensively and come out with that statement.

585~~~
Maybe. Either way all good and am excited about the kid.

586~~~
Really what make this all the more sweet, is how the media and pundits have all written him off before he's even kicked a ball for us. It's crazy, almost criminal, the amount of criticism and pressure to pile of a 19 year old, just because of a high transfer fee that he had no control over whatsoever.

He could still either be a Henry, or a Macheda, but that goes a long way to shutting up his detractors for now.

587~~~
He definitely gave it the eyes. That's always the sign of someone who's comfortable in front of goal.

588~~~
Still can't stop watching the goal.

I honestly think it might be one of my favourite ever United goals.

I fully expected a nervy last ten mins or so after Bentekes amazing goal but then this kid steps up and scores a goal none of us will forget. It killed the game and was the perfect start to his career with us. Very exciting talent that looks like he will turn in to a top player for us over the years. Hope he plays against PSV rather than run the risk of rushing Rooney  back and not 100%.

590~~~
Great goal and a vital one too. I hope this takes the pressure off him a bit but it will probably just raise people's expectations. Not to mention that trully was a Hentry-esque goal although Henry had some finesse to his play that I don't see in Martial.

591~~~
I have seen all Wilson games in the senior team and a few Martial games at Monaco. I can't see how it's in any doubt that Martial has done better in his career.   He is a France international already.

Wilson isn't bad and he could go on to be a useful player for us but the hype is exaggerated. It's a bit of the same for all of our youth though, Januzaj was supposedly a £50m player after his debut and we didn't need Pedro because we had Lingard etc.

592~~~
I can't stop watching his goal, it's actually beautiful. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

593~~~
The more moments of brilliance he can pull of this season the more patience it will buy him actually, so even in <i>that </i>sense it's definitely a good thing.

594~~~
Was thinking the same, there'll be millions of clueless fans including non-United supporters that will be going on about how he should start. I don't think there's a 19 year old in the world that would be mature enough to lead a front 3 at any top club.

595~~~
This lads videos from the stands are always good. The clip of Martial's goal is ruined momentarily by some nob standing up (at a football match!?)
<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/139117811" width="500"></iframe>

596~~~
Not at 19 years old he didnt. At 19 years old Henry was still out on the wing looking slightly average. It was 19/20 onwards when he started to look like a superstar.

597~~~
Wow, that reaction. Hilarious to notice the cameraman actually touching the players and moving their arms to try to get a clearer shot of him <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

598~~~
What can I say that haven't been said, I like his style, and absolute self belief, first to shield the ball from that Liverpool defender, he showed in that moment that he "belonged here" and won't be ruffled, and so late in the game, with the pressure on, he went for that spectacular goal, analyze it all you want, but he 100% knew what he wanted to do, and he just went for it. This is what I've been waiting to see from Memphis, a young attacker, simply going for it, the Dutchman hasn't shown it yet. Martial will need to be eased in gradually, but he definitely has the tools.

599~~~
ha, it sounds a bit like Jimmy Liddel is giving a running commentary, except you know, telling us how Rodgers and Liverpool are shite.

600~~~
That video is great <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> the fan reactions have got me giggling.

Not sure what's wrong with standing up when we're through on goal. Where I sit everybody does.

601~~~
I did think at first he got a little lucky and the ball bobbled through nicely for him but the way he adjusts his stance and pushes the ball with his left foot so it doesn't run away from him looks pretty deliberate to me. He had it under more control that it first looks. Great goal.

602~~~
Last two times Ive gone my whole area stood for the entire game.  Id prefer they didnt in fairness. My missus wasnt happy about it and the most recent time my 8 year old lad had trouble getting a a decent view at times

I was in the Stretford End a few years ago where it is common knowledge they all stand and that is fine, I had purposely avoided going back there but still got stuck standing where I have been recently in the East Stand.

I had heard that the stewards told people to sit down but I never saw that once

Maybe I could get answers from that poster on here who works as a steward at OT. But I cant remember his name... <a class="username" data-user="49620, @Damien" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49620/">@Damien</a> can you remember?

603~~~
I was most impressed with how calm and nonchalant he was the whole time. I would've been shitting myself if I was to make my debut for United against Liverpool at Old Trafford. He walked in like he owns the place.

604~~~
Has more Premier League goals than Wayne Rooney since April 4th.

605~~~
I have seen a few of his compilation vids on Youtube, and in all of them I have noticed him doing that skill on a few occasions against different opposition, which is why when he started running at Skertel I thought that he's going to do that skill once again and boy did he do it right. Anyway, my main point is that I think this is going to become a trademark skill for him and I look forward to seeing it over and over again in the future.

606~~~
So, will he start vs PSV?

607~~~
I think so.

608~~~
I think we'll bring him on as a sub again. Van Gaal said against Liverpool it was the right time to introduce him as we were winning and the game opened up. I expect a tight match against PSV initially.  Stick Young on the left and Memphis up front, bring Martial on later (althjough I would be excited to see him start).

609~~~
I completely agree with what Gary Neville said about that goal being the perfect way to buy himself some time in regards to goals and performances without people getting on his back. I hope he really kicks on now, but I'd understand if he was a bit hit/miss this season.

That being said. That goal, my word. A 19 year old lad on his debut, with so much pressure on him, scoring against Liverpool at the Stretty End when it looked like we might be rocking a little bit, and scoring a goal like that.

You can't help but be romantic about football sometimes.

610~~~
Standing up for big chances is the most natural behaviour you can possibly get in a football ground. Great vid by the way.

611~~~
I can't stop watching the goal. I've genuinely watched it at least a 100 times now. I'm just a sad sack. The combination of the quality of the goal itself, being against Liverpool, the state of the game and most definitely the commentary from Tyler - it's just spine-chilling, goosebumping good shit.

612~~~
I can understand the need of easing him into the team in the Premier League, but he should start tomorrow. We shouldn't be playing Fellaini, who isn't even a striker, over a player who was a regular starter and one of the best players in a team that reached the quarter finals last season and weren't that far away from eliminating Juventus.

Martial has more experience in the CL than Fellaini even at 19 years old and we need his speed and unpredictability.

613~~~
Did you guys hear Liverpool have a new movie coming out? It's called Forgetting Anthony Martial

614~~~
This. It was just perfect, looking like a nervous end to the game, and he just picks it up and RUNS. Tyler's commentary and the crowd just make it so.. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

615~~~
He's a big lad isn't he?

616~~~
He's not very tall but he's powerful.

617~~~
Think he should start tomorrow. Knows what the Champions League and playing against PSV type sides will be all about.
Can drop him back to the bench on Sunday and play either Rooney or Fellaini in a tougher away game.

618~~~
Just shy of 6ft I'd say. Impressed with his strength at his age though.

619~~~
I legitimately cannot stop watching the goal - it might be one of my favorite United goals ever. 

Everything about it is incredible.

620~~~
Still on a high after that goal. One of the best moments from a Utd player in years.

621~~~
Owen against City for me

622~~~
Same <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

623~~~
Yeah I'd play him tomorrow then at home to Ipswich.

624~~~
Me too. No doubt though, we'll have some plebs in the media having a hissy fit if he doesn't score or has a forgettable game.

625~~~
I miss Andy Gray, I think he would have punctuated the moment better.

626~~~
Your negative is van Gaal's ideal striker. He likes strikers that have 10 touches in a game but score 2 goals.

627~~~
Maybe. It's not really a criticism just an observation. The way the game was going it was sort of guaranteed he wouldn't have a lot of touches. Plus it was his debut in a huge match

628~~~
The bald guy visibly tries shoving Harry Styles away to get himself on camera <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

629~~~
Anyone saying that there was a deflected touch that he didn't mean etc, go and watch a video of Suarez. This is exactly what I used to say about him, he is ridiculously good at dribbling but he has a forceful style where he makes touches like that all the time to get past defenders whilst changing direction at speed. It might not be elegant or textbook, but it's made him one of the best in the world.

630~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AR66LGrycO0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

631~~~
He should start tomorrow, Rooney is out and fellaini is no more than a make shift striker, would give us a great threat on the counter as well. But sadly I think it will be fellaini up front again and we will only see martial from the bench.

632~~~
I'd start him on the bench and give him half an hour. We need to play our cards right now he's had a great start. Don't put him under pressure to deliver but give him enough time to shine. His first start should come at Ipswich.

633~~~
Martial has a lot of finesse to his game. You'll see more of it the more you watch him.
He looked rapid. We'll see more of this on Tuesday

634~~~
This.

635~~~
Scary how similar the little shimmy is. So excited by him. France has been super kind to us with lovable first teamers. First the king then paddy. Here's hoping schneiderlin and martial add themselves to the list

636~~~
Right up there with Giggs vs Arsenal for me now

637~~~
Yep I try not take my kid depending on the tickets as he cant see when I'm in the lower tears. The higher you go the less the stand (obviously)

638~~~
For me, the fact that it was intentional (even with a slight bit of luck), speaks volumes about what he can do. That's the type of run/attacking you'd expect him to try in every match. More of a promising sign than if he'd scored a hit-and-hope screamer or even a strike like Benteke.

639~~~
Ok, how many times has everyone seen this? I've seen it at least 50 times, probably a lot more. Was about 30 just on Saturday lol

640~~~
I think he meant to do that skill but I think he got lucky with the execution of it with a few deflections. Take nothing away from the goal, loved it.

641~~~
Great physique for a young lad. Liked that little cameo with Lovren. He'll be ok with the physical side, won't he? Disappointing nobody has been able to wheel out the obligatory 'needs to bulk up' line but that's the only negative I can see. Tremendously exciting, the whole thing.

642~~~
Agree.

643~~~
Bollocks. Let him loose. He'll be buzzing. We can always take him out for the weekend.

644~~~
This

645~~~
Against an opponent like PSV, no disrespect, we should really start him. Next PL game when Rooney is hopefully back he will sit on the bench again at least for 60 minutes.

646~~~
He looks a lot more built at 19 than Ronaldo was at a similar age. He looks strong and lean compared to Memphis stocky look.

647~~~
First match back in CL for us, I'm sure we'll err on the side of caution so expecting him on the bench to start. Coming on for 20mins against tired legs and tired minds, that could work very well in a game we'll be looking to 'dominate' rather than be aggressive.

648~~~
He should start and build on the weekend's positive energy.

649~~~
You guys are overhyping him, I see his name in every threads.<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

650~~~
Looking at it again, the intent is there but there is a deflection of Skrtles foot. 

Still, I'd like to think he adjusted his body to take account of it <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

651~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/74pd" width="560"></iframe>

Did anyone else notice, I think it's either Shaw or Young, getting their French and Italian accents mixed up and screaming "Antoni-Ah" at the start of the clip <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

It's not Darmian either, he shows up later!

652~~~
We actually speak like that in the south.

653~~~
I was on a wedding and tracked the result on livescore when I could, was to nervous to track BBC live update (one of the stupid things I do when United is playing <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> ). Then <a class="username" data-user="58774, @Šjor Bepo" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/58774/">@Šjor Bepo</a> texted me it was Martial who scored and I couldn't believe it. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

I've watched his goal about 6, 7 times and every time I got goosebumps. What a moment! <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

What a cool, cool finish, like there's nothing to it. Like it's not his debut against Liverpool.



Btw, from YNFA:

654~~~
Let's hope he ends up more Thierry than Lenny.

655~~~
Awful fat joke <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

656~~~
Is it wrong that the thing I find most annoying about those Mirror articles is the '£58m'. He doesn't cost £58m until he gets a CL winner's medal <i>and</i> the Balon d'Or. Ffs.

657~~~
We've got him for the long run there's no need to rush him in, personally I'd give him another 20/30 minute cameo. Let him have that Sub spark for now...

658~~~
Starting? Hope he does well!

659~~~
Can't believe it!

660~~~
I'm excited <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

661~~~
MARTIAL FEVER.

662~~~
Martial and Memphis could hopefully be great in a few years time

663~~~
Yeah, LvG agrees.

664~~~
I hope the pressure doesn't get to him too much after that amazing start. Good luck Martial!

665~~~
He's cool as feck though. Wasn't fazed against Liverpool at OT for his debut either.

666~~~
We'll see how he goes.

Obviously very young but his record in Ligue 1 wasn't super-impressive, I can see him being bullied a bit in this game as a lone striker.

667~~~
I wonder how the lad would've reacted two weeks ago if someone had told him that he'd be starting away against the Dutch Champions as a striker for Manchester United.

668~~~
In plain English? He wouldn't understand what you were on about.

669~~~
Don't think so. He was great as a lone striker against Valencia in both legs, and held his own as a lone striker away to PSG against Luiz and Silva, and started against both Juventus and Arsenal in the knockout rounds... For someone so young, he has a decent amount of big game experience already.

670~~~
PSV are crap. Hattrick please!

671~~~
Congrats Anthony Martial on your first start. Hope you score. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

672~~~
Yes, that too. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>
Football is so unpredictable.

673~~~
I'm flabbergasted that he's starting, really. Happy for him though!

674~~~
Drifting out wide a fair bit. As long as someone fills in for him it should be good, he looks dangerous out there.

675~~~
He's been good today but I somehow still expect him to get a huge amount of stick.

676~~~
He's very raw, but he adds an extra dynamic up front.

677~~~
He's finding a lot of space and linking the attack well. Also seems happy to run the channel.

Literally the inverse of when Rooney is up top.

678~~~
Looks surprisingly comfortable, possibly more so than Rooney when he has the ball at least.

679~~~
Looks decent.

680~~~
Adds much needed dynamism to our attack. Will only get better as he develops imo.

681~~~
I like how he's playing. Great movement, great link up.

682~~~
Wonderful turns and great pass to young too - neymar like..

683~~~
The guy's class. Oozes quality. 

Difficult to see how he gets dropped when he looks so technically and physically proficient.

684~~~
Should've being a bit selfish there with that lovely turn and run.

685~~~
He certainly brings a lot more to the team than Rooney at the moment... I'm eager to see whether Van Gaal sticks with him, or chooses to worsen the team by needing to play his captain.

686~~~
Good run late on there. I was hoping he'd twat it from 30 yards rather than playing it to Young.

687~~~
His pace makes a huge different to our attack. Gives the defenders a hard time too, challenges for everything.

688~~~
this. with that said i was hoping young would have wacked that pass to the far post. wouldnt have been even mad if it was off target.

689~~~
His pace, movement, willingness to run and his pressing are so far a world away from what we have been seeing so far.

690~~~
Same. I was hoping Young just hit it first time at goal and hope for the best. Much better than the touch and blast he ended up taking.

691~~~
Nothing's really coming off for him so far in this game, he's not doing well. He clearly has the talent, the technical ability so I'm not worried at all.

692~~~
Looks seriously impressive 

1st start, away, cl game

N nerves at all

693~~~
He's been great, could've easily had two assists.

694~~~
What are you talking about? Plenty is coming off for him

695~~~
Much more exciting to watch than Rooney, very dynamic player up front.

696~~~
This guy is class

697~~~
Did you forget to turn your TV on or something?

698~~~
Really like the look of this lad. Been more of a threat upfront in 45 mins than Rooney/Mata have all season.

699~~~
He's been our best attacker and it's been our best striking performance by a distance, IMO.

700~~~
He's linking up amazingly well with Memphis. Reckon the latter loves playing with him.

701~~~
Really like what I'm seeing.

702~~~
The biggest positive from the night so far. Looks ready, and has offered much more than Rooney has in recent matches.

703~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

704~~~
Should just keep banging it into this man, they can't handle it.

705~~~
I like how he chews chewing gum when he's playing. Adds to the swag.

706~~~
His hold up play has been just immense! I was a Falcao advocate last season but he was never as good as Martial has been in all his games combined. £36m fecking bargain! Let's hope we don't jinx the lad. He is the real deal!

707~~~
Crap finish there..

708~~~
Really look the like of this guy, could be the real deal, 19 years old, so much ahead of him, has given us something different tonight

709~~~
He needs to play 9 every game, his hold up game will be key for us.

710~~~
Cracking number 9. Suits our play perfectly.

711~~~
Thought he was exciting but poor tonight, hes one of those sort of players who will either score a great goal or give the ball away, he wont displace Roomney but he gives you something different.

712~~~
Not really sure what game you were watching - he generally held the ball up very well and played some decent passes. Did miles better than Rooney has done all season in that regard. Thought he had a very good game.

713~~~
Really not sure what game you were watching, his hold up play was brilliant and he showed he had loads of strength. His pace in behind was also the biggest threat all night I'm really not sure how you can say he won't displace Rooney when that's 10x better than anything Rooney has shown all year.

714~~~
Only good thing about tonight

715~~~
Really the only positive from the game - looks proper quality

716~~~
Promising performance.

717~~~
He and Schweinsteiger.

I hope we see him start more often, showed a lot more drive to get forward than any of our other 'strikers'.

718~~~
What a stupid comment.

719~~~
What I like is that we can finally play passes into our striker on the edge of the box. Will add a lot to our football.

720~~~
Clueless

721~~~
Good performance.

722~~~
Rather have him leading the line than Rooney. 

He'll make mistakes but at least with him the only way is up.

723~~~
Decent first start for the lad.

724~~~
Well I did just watch him unbiased for 90 minutes, gives me a fairly big clue. Hes only 19, and how much do you want to wager that he wont displace Rooney? Even I would win that bet.

Nothing to do with his talent, he just wont displace him because its Rooney.

725~~~
Very good hold up play today, looks very dangerous too. Better at leading the line than Wayne I thought

726~~~
Bizarre comment after that match.

727~~~
Can't believe he is only 19. He's going to be some player for us.

728~~~
Turned off for the last 15 minutes or so. I don't think we should expect too much from him this early on. Still prefer Rooney up front.

729~~~
Hope he starts again at the weekend, promising performance, our best player tonight imo

730~~~
His all round game was very impressive. Our best player, feck knows how this lot have given MOTM to Bastian.

731~~~
Held the ball up well, and laid it off for others. Unfortunately, our players couldn't create anything for him.

732~~~
Very promising without ever quite happening for him tonight. We actually look a decent side when we feed the ball into him and he tries to link up with runners such as Memphis.

733~~~
the beauty of him over Rooney, is even when he's not involved one burst of pace can see him away.

Positive is the small glimpse of him and Memphis' interplay.

734~~~
Put Rooney behind him and we are fine, I said it last week and I say it again.

735~~~
I thought he did well, only thing was he could have had more efforts himself but he chose to make a pass to a teammate in a good position

736~~~
That has nothing to do with your initial comment though, which suggested he wouldn't displace Rooney because of ability.

Also, you "watching him unbiased" clearly didn't give you a "fairly big clue".

737~~~
No I just watched it unbiased, he was exciting but he was also poor tonight. When youre that young its very common that you do something either really spectacular or something really inconsistent.

738~~~
It's safe to assume you're either drunk or clueless because your description of him isn't remotely close to the truth. I reckon you made that judgment before he even played tonight, purely because he scored a great goal in the last game and he's young. It certainly wasn't based on his performance or skillset

739~~~
Looked very, very composed. Seems much older than he actually is. Decent performance.

740~~~
This guy is going to be a very good CF, he did well tonight I thought.

741~~~
Good game on his full debut, lots of promise

Hold up and link play was good, strong pacey, give us a different outlet that just passing it around slowly. He's a target for the like of Herrera, Memphis, Mata to actually thread a ball to, any time this happened during the game it opened up the defence for us more than I've seen recently (not counting Brugge when they were been idiots leaving 2-3 back chasing 8 goals)

742~~~
Talent spotting about as good as his betting ability.

743~~~
He looks really lively but so often was one against 4-5 players it was ridiculous. If we have a player who can actually hold up the ball a bit we need to provide the right movement around him to make a pass from him actually matter if his only option is to pass it back into midfield we aren't getting anywhere.

744~~~
Had a decent game. Impressive for someone new and young

745~~~
Exactly. Great promise.

746~~~
Well to be fair even if it was that you;ve only seen two games of Martial in a United shirt thats nowhere near enough to decide whether hes better yet.

747~~~
Impressed with him, you can definitely see the talent. One negative is his aerial play, i don't know if he can improve that, you don't have to be a good header though.

748~~~
He's class. Great hold up play and really calm and mature on the ball. Really gives us so much more having someone who knows how to hold up the ball and run in behind up there. Rooney behind him, with Memphis on the left and then whoever on the right (Herrera/Mata/Young), and that's a great attack IMO.

749~~~
You can keep saying you're unbiased all you like, you're still completely wrong.

750~~~
Some real positives alright. A couple of his passes were under hit and he struggled aerially. His understanding with Memphis seems telepathic.

751~~~
He was excellent, some absolute cretins going at him in the matchday thread.

752~~~
You're being called out on the fact you said he was poor, which is complete horseshit and you know it. He didn't score but added more to our game than we've seen for a while, despite being only nineteen.

Won't displace Rooney mind, but your other remark was rubbish!

753~~~
Hope he gets another start, it fills me with some sort of confidence that at least we have a forward making positive runs.

His holdup play is very underrated.

754~~~
Was terrific.
Very reassured, cool as a cucumber & the kind of linkup play you'd expect from an experienced CF.

755~~~
Sure, keep changing your argument. You've gone from "poor game, he's worse than Rooney" to "he wouldn't displace Rooney because Rooney is Rooney" to "you can't judge him based on two games" in five minutes. That's very well done.

756~~~
Just because you keep saying it, doesn't make it true.

Nothing worse than a rival fan on here thinking their opinion is 'unbiased'.

You're as biased, if not more so, than most united fans on here (who tend to judge our players fairly on the whole and often harsher than most critics).

757~~~
I thought he looked really good. Setting aside his price, as a young striker he looks like he's got bags of talent and offered a threat we so badly need. Able to turn and run at people and hold up the ball in dangerous areas. As his understanding with the team grows and he gets more maturer he could be a big asset.

758~~~
I think poor is a bit much, Mata was poor, this lad was quite bright. However I agree he probably isn't going to replace Rooney yet but I think he will start wide right when Rooney comes back.

759~~~
Only plus from tonight really.

Him and Memphis are great together. Telepathic stuff. Think adding Rooney in the mix will make it a lot better too.

760~~~
Rubbish. I am  one of the least biased people of all. Maybe it was more Brumas excellent display I dont know, I saw exciting flashes but poor in terms of actually  getting through on goal/scoring.

I didnt think he was poor Saturday FYI, its not a black and white scenario. God forbid anyone have an opinion!

761~~~
Promising.

762~~~
He was simply too often isolated tonight. If the rest of our players would actually get their asses into motion instead of standing statically in their positions or actually spot some of his runs, something might come of his play but the way our team is currently playing he has to show a bit more of the magic he showed against Liverpool to get another goal with this team behind him.

763~~~
Did well. Seriously talented player.

764~~~
Agreed, done better than I expected. We look different with a guy who has pace and great control up front.

765~~~
ffs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

766~~~
It'll never happen but would love to see him up top with Rooney

I miss 4-4-2

767~~~
There were promising signs of link up play with him and Depay which was encouraging till the latter kind of started messing up.

768~~~
Very very encouraging.

769~~~
He looked good tonight, definitely showed some very positive signs.

770~~~
Would like to see this once:

771~~~
One of the few positives from tonight. He's going to be quite a player.

The composure he has when he's been attacked by defenders from all sides is fantastic. His touch isn't bad either.

772~~~
I have to say from what I've seen so far, he is promising. I enjoyed him and Memphis linking up and I hope they can build upon that.

773~~~
His hold-up play and composure reminds me of Benzema.

Looks a serious talent.

774~~~
Encouraging display. He looks a little bit like a player.

775~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

You can't just decide yourself that you're unbiased. That's a bit like those scousers who go on about how humble they are, not realising it's one of the least humble things ever to declare yourself so humble. 

I don't mind different opinions. Just don't embarrass yourself with the unbiased stuff.

776~~~
I knew the play reminded of someone!!!

Memphis was the only player looking to play him to feet, why the rest of the guys didnt do that I will never know.

777~~~
I like the look of M&M.

778~~~
Hope he keeps his place. I'd be willing to put up with a few average performances in order to speed up his integration into the side. He has everything we're looking for in a centre forward. Just needs experience

779~~~
Ok but im still going to defend being accused of being bias when im not actually being biased! Smalling had an excellent game, Schweinsteiger did, Shaw did until the injury, I was just of the opinion that he looked isolated and whilst trying to do something special gave it away. No need for people to take such offence to it its not saying hes a bad player!

780~~~
The way he can bring others into play, runs into space and that he can move with the ball is just brilliant. He will be a star, no doubt! Shame there is not much service for him tonight

781~~~
I thought he did well, we didn't have anyone playing any balls to him to run onto and PSV played very deep, but his hold-up play and link ups were very good, plus he can actually turn his man and run with the ball, some of the link-ups with him and Memphis were the nights only real positive.

782~~~
For me he needs to start, Id even play Rooney in behind him, think it could work well tbh.

783~~~
I actually liked him today. There's definite touch of nonchalant class to him.

Some good touches and hold up too though could have done better on other occasions. Also like how he drifts around.

784~~~
This guy is incredibly good with his feet and can think quickly and be tidy in possession which is a very very great trait for us to see.

785~~~
The only possitive today, he was stuck upfront and probably instructed not to go left , i think he should be given more freedom. Hold up play, first touch, strength all are great. He can pass too and create good oppertunities, the best raw materials are their, we just need a better coach to get him to the level he potentially can.

786~~~
I think reverting back to a classic 442 with him and rooney up top would be very nice.

787~~~
His performance was one of the good things tonight, led the line really well. Understandable that he faded towards the end, the whole damn team did.

Looking forward to seeing more.

Will be interesting to see what happens when Rooney is fit.

788~~~
Yep, with Memphis and Young either side.

Looking forward though we will need a better #10 and a replacement for Young. Goetze and Bale next summer please!

789~~~
Memphis and Martial were the real bright points for me. Very encouraged to see what they can do together.

790~~~
His link up play and holding up the ball is really encouraging. There were promising signs of an understanding developing with Memphis also. The team failed to get it into him enough though.

791~~~
I want to see him in the team even when Rooney returns.

Thought he was good until Fellaini came on and we lost all momentum and then Martial faded a bit. His link up with Memphis tonight was positive as well.

792~~~
iirc, it's only his 6th full game.

793~~~
Eh? He rarely gave it away In fact most occasions he played someone into a goal scoring opportunity! What more did you expect from him then? Man if that was poor for a teenager in his first start your clearly here on a wind up!

794~~~
Made the mistake of wading into the postmatch thread right after the final whistle. Christ, some absolute nutters come out the woodwork.

795~~~
Yep. They linked well at times too despite him having just arrived.

I really like the look of Martial. He will give the ball away and it was a difficult game to take defenders on and run, but he seems a very complete player. His technical skills are clear, but he also seems very strong and capable of centre forward play.

I'd be tempted to put Rooney in as a number 10 when he returns. A player like Martial is very different to what we've had for awhile.

796~~~
you want to avoid the last 20 minutes of the matchday thread like a plague.

797~~~
Yep. Very promising.

798~~~
You very well might not be, but by calling yourself unbiased you open yourself up to ridicule. Just offer an opinion, don't try to put that opinion on a pedestal it clearly doesn't deserve. 

I personally thought it was a very promising performance and he looked to already be building a good understanding with some of his teammates, especially Memphis who he played into good scoring positions on a couple of occasions. 

Obviously I'm totally unbiased so my opinion is worth more than anyone else's. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

799~~~
Was impressed by how unfazed and comfortable he was starting up top on his own. Very strong and linked up well.

800~~~
Very composed and encouraging performance from him.

801~~~
Ok I guess the reasoning behind it is that as a rival you automatically feel you need to make the point because otherwise any negative opinion is always viewed as being because youre a rival!

802~~~
Thought he did very well. Strong on the ball, good touch, held it up well and brought others into play. Thought he tried turning and running with the ball too often but shows he doesn't lack confidence.

803~~~
No, your point was viewed as stupid because it went against everything that actually happened in the match. And you then tried to justify you having a different opinion than everyone else with "I'm unbiased". Having a different opinion is fair enough, but you might want to argue your case at the very least, which you haven't done at all.

804~~~
Yes I have, several times. I felt he was isolated and that nothing came off for him today. It was a wierd game anyway after the injury there was little fluidity at all.

805~~~
From what I've seen this is his forte. He'll get it wrong a fair deal, but he seems genuinely gifted at running with the ball at pace and keeping it under control so keeping at it will reap rewards eventually.

806~~~
I know its asking a lot and he is still young etc but I really hope Rooney comes back to play behind him rather than replace him.

807~~~
You "felt" isn't really a great case though, and is him being isolated his fault? Of course he lost the ball on occasion, but more often than not he held onto the ball and passed it on to another United player - I don't really think that's up for debate. You could look up stats and I'm certain they'd tell you that. Whether or not he did it well enough is a different discussion, but your initial statement was "hes one of those sort of players who will either score a great goal or give the ball away," which clearly wasn't the case.

808~~~
Did well tonight. Since Rooney will obviously be a starter since he's LVGs captain, I'd play him in behind Martial. 

I agree with whoever said he plays a bit like Benzema.

809~~~
His link up with memphis and strength on the ball are huge positives. Good pace and runs into good areas.

Can only get better.

810~~~
He looks very promising.

811~~~
Pretty decent performance really. He gives our attack a dynamism that Rooney certainly doesn't. I wouldn't be dropping him but it will happen.

812~~~
I'm sold on him already. As orgasmic as his goal against Liverpool was, I think tonight convinced me more that he can make a significant contribution this season and be a genuine option for us from the start. Physically very good, holds the ball well and showed good understanding with players he barely knows yet.

I think he will be the real deal.

813~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He was very good tonight. One of the few bright points of the game.

814~~~
Thought he was positive.

815~~~
Promising signs. Only player bar Smalling who can really have walked away with his head high.

816~~~
Very promising especially when you consider he's only actually had 3 training sessions with the rest of the squad

817~~~
Memphis as well.

818~~~
I guess. It was an okay-to-good performance for Memphis. He took his goal very, very well, but there were a couple of other chances he really should've scored. Straight after his first, and the Martial lay-off stick out in particular.

819~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TASrpT7mKOc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

820~~~
He was very good. Think it could work with Rooney in behind him.

821~~~
This. For all of our skepticism regarding Rooney, I think he is exactly what Martial needs. An experienced striker for him to learn from, it will only be positive for his development.

822~~~
He's the real deal. Absolutely no doubt in my mind. The kid has it all.

823~~~
He's played better in the two games he's featured for United than anything he did in Ligue 1. I'm not sure if the French members/Ligue 1 viewers would agree with me.. but it looks like his move has really kicked him on.

For what it's worth, I thought he looked incredibly nippy tonight. Had no problem going by 1 or 2 players and then zipping it across the pitch to someone in space. He's started excellently.

824~~~
That run at 3 minutes, those are the kind of things Im really excited about with Martial.

825~~~
He's like a young Louis Saha!

826~~~
Did you see him at all this season for Monaco before his transfer? He looked pretty much like this, if not even better, against Valencia and had a decent game alone up top against PSG. The valencia games he really stood out though and when I mostly took notice of how good he really was. These opening games for United have only confirmed that. Strong on the ball, surprisingly calm and mature for his age, and very quick as well. Has it all to become a top striker.

827~~~
Hopefully he can grasp the language quickly because it was quite apparent that he couldn't really tell anyone else what he wanted. Every time the camera panned to him on a close up, he was saying something to himself or silent.

Did very well last night considering the above and it was his first start too I thought.

828~~~
Yeah and I think Rooney will benefit the most from having what is basically a better version of Chicharito ahead of him and Bastien behind him, the spaces Martial will open up for him will be crucial. I also liked what we did when Young went to the left and Memphis on the right because Memphis, I thought, benefited the most because he didn't have to take the extra touch to to inside.

829~~~
He will be a top player, no doubt about that

830~~~
Looks like he's going to be a great signing. His link up play with Memphis is very promising, I hope,we see much more of him.

Also, its great to see such a dynamic center forward, we've missed that.

831~~~
Also think that he had a good game. Very excited to have him in our team and I don't think about that fee anymore. As a matter a fact, I'm fairly confident that he'll justify the fee. Worked well with Memphis and I think he offered glimpses of movement that we, fans, have been longing to see. 

Can't wait to see more from him. Great prospect but <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/15/anthony-martial-manchester-united-team-bus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apparently not that good when it's time to get on the team bus!</a>

832~~~
Showed glimpses of what he's  about and had a good understanding with depay.

833~~~
Totally agree. When you watch him it's hard to believe he's 19. Rarely see that sort of strength and intelligence in a player of that age.

834~~~
Old Man Martial, indeed. Quite exciting when you see his current level and that he's got lots of time and room for improvement. I don't know whether he'll be able to trigger all of his add-on clauses (the Ballon D'or being the biggest one obviously), but here's to hoping we'll have a fine player for years to come (and hold on to him once he comes good).

835~~~
Would be nice to know how quick he really is in comparison to Henry. I think he's been holding himself back a bit.

836~~~
Definitely the real deal, and with the lack of proper young centre-forwards around, signing him ahead of the other top European clubs was a masterstroke.

he is already a better centre-forward than Rooney, and any decision to bench him to put Rooney back in the team, while maybe being beneficial to him, would weaken our already impotent attack by quite a bit. He can make things happen, Rooney can basically only score from the spot or if the team serves up a string of sitters. A modern centre-forward.

837~~~
I keep reading the line that he's still very raw. I've seen nothing in his game that actually fits that description in these first two games for him. His touch, vision and hold up- qualities that are bound to improve with more experience were spot on last night. Like this article that has the ongoing narrative about being raw:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/15115/9993161/analysing-anthony-martials-first-start-for-manchester-united-against-psv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.skysports.com/football/n...first-start-for-manchester-united-against-psv</a>

He should start as our striker for the time being, he is the only one we have suited for that role. Rooney can try to nail town the nr.10 position. Allthough I don't think he's got what it takes anymore he'll probably be a certain starter so let's try putting him behind Martial when he comes back.

838~~~
Hoping he starts the next few games.

839~~~
Promising performance!

840~~~
anybody thinks that he looks like a young Sylvain Distin? Father and son <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

841~~~
It's because he is young, people know that he is only 19, so he must be raw. But he isn't raw, otherwise what do you say about Hernandez or Welbeck. Martial is at an early stage of his development around the same stage than Rooney when he joined us, but like Rooney he isn't naive tactically or athletically, Ranieri and Jardim did a great job with him.

842~~~
Hopefully he starts on Sunday for me he's better up top than Rooney so far and he can only get better. It's very exciting the fact that we have him and memphis in the squad not a bad pair of prospects.

843~~~
His hold up play allowed our midfielders to get up the pitch very well. Has to continue there. Shove rooney to wherever.

844~~~
I really admire how he fearlessly runs at opposition defenders, like Shaw and Wilshere. I hope he does not loose that part of his game.

845~~~
He put in a great performance last night, great physical presence, a sharp turn and very comfortable on the ball. Outstanding work-rate and super attitude. Disciplined too, got plenty of it from the PSV CBs, just got on with the job.

846~~~
The bench, preferably.

847~~~
I'm hoping for #10 personally. Think back to whenever he's been partnered with a fast player in attack.... It always brought the best out of him. Of course that was a while ago and with Fergie, but I have hope. Kind of like a last bit of hope for him to come back, but his presence on the pitch makes a difference for sure and United look worse without him there I think. He definitely shouldn't play up top, but in the hole, behind martial and alongside Memphis, and encouraging him to play with pace and giving him freedom, and I think he'll get back to a good level.

848~~~
Yeah, I do have some slight hope left that he could play well surrounded with the pace of Martial and Memphis, he's always linked well with pacy attackers (Ronaldo, Saha, Welbeck) in the past. But that would mean either Mata or Herrera missing out, and right now they're better players then Rooney imo. 

Rooney is a massive conundrum really. Doesn't seem to have the pace or physicality to play upfront in the PL, but isn't as good as other players in the squad as a #10. But he's the captain, so has to play. Its all a bit of a headache in all honesty. 

Right now, if I had to pick a team from the current squad (presuming everyone is fit) to play for my life, Rooney wouldn't be a part of it.

849~~~
True, but mata yesterday had one of his worst games for united and played as a 10 (just an off day, but still). Can't see Van Gaal picking him there again any time soon, and while I love Herrera, Rooney is a big goal threat when played as a 10, more then Herrera. The thing with Rooney is that he goes through such dry spells that we all for get how good he can actually play, since when he's not on form his all around play goes to shit. But if he gets back in form playing as a 10, hes back to being our best player. You can't really explain it, but its worth sticking it out with him in the hope he finds his form again, even if we have to sit through really shit games. 

But like you said, the type of player martial is, he has always been at his best when partnered with someone like that. Martial holds the ball up brilliantly, can run in behind and stretch defences, and can link up really well. Same with Memphis out on the left. If he doesn't perform with them, then I will probably lose hope for him, but I think he can still do well for us.

850~~~
I don't want to seem like I'm picking on you directly as I'm sure a lot of people have this opinion but I always find it odd how people can say he is better than Rooney up front based on 120 minutes of football for United.

Just as we shouldn't dismiss players based on a few games, we shouldn't hype them up based on it either. I agree he was very impressive and I hope will become a great player for us but he is young and is bound to be inconsistent.

The only way I see him starting on Sunday is if Rooney isn't fully fit or if we play both of them. Again this isn't me saying Rooney is in amazing form....just too early to claim Martial is better than Rooney up front due to the limited evidence

851~~~
The obvious response to this is that Martial has looked far more threatening in his 120 minutes than Rooney has all season. Since the start of the year, even.

852~~~
and Rooney as a number 10 means all our play will be going out to the right wing

853~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69549, @DWelbz19" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69549/">@DWelbz19</a> Has hit the nail on the head for me we all know that on his day Rooney is a beast but recently he's been far from his best and his poor touch and hesitancy in front of goal has lead to us missing out on a lot of chances. 
Our number 10 slot is yet to be locked down and Rooney has the perfect skill set for the role in my eyes so hopefully that's where he will play and find form again. 
I just think bar the lack of goals last night was the sharpest we've looked in attack in a long time so I'm hoping using the same squad we will be able to replicate that in the premier league.

854~~~
He has the perfect skill set for the role when his overall game is going well and he's able to create and link the attack and defence. I'm not convinced he'd be particularly effective at the moment, and would probably rather see us going with Herrera there. I think LVG should make a choice between playing one of Martial/Rooney up top. Martial doesn't <i>have </i>to play, since he's going to get plenty of playing time anyway and LVG may still have faith in a Rooney regeneration, but playing Martial would certainly be a gigantic vote of confidence.

855~~~
True but it's shut a short time period to judge him either positively or negatively in my opinion. 

Ok so this is maybe a bit of an extreme case but if you looked at Macheda in his first two appearances everyone thought he'd be a world beater in a few years and probably seen as a better striker than "present Rooney". In reality it doesn't always work out that way. Similarly if you said 12 months ago that Januzaj would be sent out on loan (I.e. when he was carrying the team for Moyes) most wouldn't believe you.

I think and hope Martial will be excellent for us and certainly seems it. But an in form Wayne Rooney is a better option for now. He's 19 and will be inconsistent, that's just part of his development process and understandle.

I guarantee if Martial plays and has a couple of bad games the "waste of money" and "not enough" comments will unfairly be said by media and fans alike.

I just think with young players like him we shouldn't be expecting him to be the answers to our prayers and should let him develop at his own rate. Just my opinion

856~~~
You are talking about a player with +70 games behind him, Macheda wasn't at the same level than Martial. Yes he is 19 years old but he is one of those rare 19 years old who only needs to play, they don't need protection, they need game. Like Gotze, Verratti, Draxler, Rooney or Sterling before.

857~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2Vwd0SIxJg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Some sexy stuff there between Martial and Depay.

858~~~
Herrera fanboys/Rooney haters dislike this

859~~~
Given all the context, that was a cracking performance.

Easily the most involved performance by a United #9 in a long time.

860~~~
and Shaw Smalling DDG Morgan Herrera Adnan quite a useful bunch of top young players coming through! The future looks excellent!

861~~~
Those passes into the feet of the striker and a striker who can play with back to goal something we've lacked since SAF's last season, and here and there since when RVP has had a good game. But for the most part it has been one of the big missing links in our football. Should be interesting to see how good Martial can become at this in the coming seasons. Good thing is, unlike a Lukaku who is undoubtedly stronger, Martial has strength but also the technical quality to turn and run or drift between pockets of space.

862~~~
Yeah good assessment. He isn't beastly in the air but that's not something we should really be worried about. I'd take the ball technique and pace he has.

863~~~
Nope this herrera fan boy approves.

864~~~
------------Martial
Memphis--Rooney--Mata

I'd be happy with this, at least for a few games to see if they can fit together. maybe Young on for Mata, but I think Young can influence the game more off the bench than Mata.

865~~~
His movement off the ball and hold-up play is really strong. Thought he was the only positive from Tuesday. 

Would be pretty disappointed if he doesn't start against Southhampton. He very much looks like the real deal.

866~~~
Herrera looks just as likely to have a pop on goal as anyone.  One of the most frustrating things about Rooney (wherever you play him) is that he doesn't put his laces through the ball and have a shot anymore.

867~~~
His feet are fecked

868~~~
Wow, just got home from two weeks out in the woods in the army and saw we won 3-1 against pool. What a goal he had <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

869~~~
Out the door will do nicely.

870~~~
Like it that he runs in the channels and is more between fullback and centre back while with Rooney he's standing between the 2 centre backs, and it's too easy for them to win the ball back

871~~~
Indeed. Rooney is too predictable and robotic especially as number 9

872~~~
Just watched those highlights from the PSV games. Some impressive link up play and a lot of pace. Seemed to run into trouble a few times but happy he is trying to run at players.

Hope him and Memphis can spur each other on a bit like Rooney and Ronaldo did back in the day.

873~~~
I would love to see him start again today, but at the same time I would completely understand if LvG wants to ease him in.

874~~~
Pretty sure he'll be on the bench. Would absolutely love to be wrong though.

875~~~
It seems that's the way LvG wants to set up though, with the striker being quite rigid in terms of movement and not drifting into the channels. It will be interesting to see if Martial carries on the way he is considering he's only been here for a few weeks now.

876~~~
Fairly certain he's starting.

877~~~
<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

878~~~
Looking forward to seeing him and Rooney together.

879~~~
He starts!

880~~~
Delighted with what. Was expecting Rooney to go upfront with Herrera behind him. Nice to see him play again after what I thought was a good game vs PSV.

881~~~
You really have to give credit to van Gaal for showing so much faith in Memphis and Martial early on. It seems obvious given the alternatives but I still think it's something not many managers at a top club would do. And credit to Martial for impressing so much. It's quite incredible really.

882~~~
I think the issue with Rooney up front is he likes to come deep if not getting on the ball. Since we lack players who will run past him on a regular basis it inhibits our attack.

I think martial will stay up top more (although he does drift wide occasionally) which allows Rooney to be more involved in the game yet also make runs past Martial from deep. On paper it should work anyway

883~~~
Looking forward to watching Martial, Memphis, and Rooney together today.

884~~~
Rooney also likes to play around someone, he makes good use of a pivot and/or a runner.

885~~~
I agree. It looks a great combo on paper as they should compliment each other well. Martial moves out wide while Rooney will love to bomb forward from deep while Memphis and Mata both like to move infield.. 

Ideally, Rooney would do more than just ping balls out wide every time he gets the ball. Really grates me when he does that.

886~~~
All those players should be adaptable enough to switch positions during games also a bit like Rooney, Ronaldo and Tevez did. Only concern is whether LVG will let them do it. If they do our attack could become special

887~~~
No way, he's all about defensive positioning and zones.

888~~~
Well he does hive his front 4 a lot of freedom. Let's hope Rooney isn't in his "Look out right" every time he gets the ball.

889~~~
Not when it comes to his top 4.

890~~~
When will this myth die?

891~~~
When they've got their way and another manager gets the job and we get to rebuild again....

892~~~
What a waste of money

893~~~
On FM he would have 20 for composure. Scary how cool headed he appears in front of goal for a 19 year old.

894~~~
Gem.

895~~~
That finish was top class. Already showing he's worth the money. My doubts are beginning to fade away.

896~~~
Practically a tap in that could've been saved or blocked but instead he sold the defender and finished well. Very exciting kid.

897~~~
How fecking good is this guy

898~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://img.pandawhale.com/119883-morpheus-he-is-the-one-gif-Img-3Ol6.gif" src="http://img.pandawhale.com/119883-morpheus-he-is-the-one-gif-Img-3Ol6.gif"/>

899~~~
Are you fecking watching Rooney?

900~~~
I can't get over that levels of composure from a kid.

901~~~
His composure in front of goal, so far, has been exceptional for someone so young. 

 Terrific start to his career, I hope we don't burn him out. It will be important also to give him some periods of rest.

<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

904~~~
Forget Matt Damon as The Martian, we have The Martial

905~~~
He's like Welbeck.

Except exactly the opposite.

906~~~
Starting to 'get' why Monaco wanted that Ballon d'Or clause. Potential is unlimited if he's this composed at such a young age.

907~~~
He's a natural. Very composed in front of goal.

908~~~
He's so composed in the box. For someone so young that's amazing.

He's been compared to Welbeck and Welbeck still doesn't have that.

909~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

910~~~
It's not like the situation came to him - he read that from the start and made it happen.

911~~~
yep - me too!

912~~~
He's probably/definitely our best option up front. I hope he succeeds so much. Not a bad start at all!

913~~~
Welbeck would've fallen over before that shot and mssed the target

914~~~
Must say considering his transfer fee he's done amazingly well. He doesn't do pressure. Lucky bugger.

915~~~
He is so cool. It's a surprise and it's not at the same time, he was like that at Monaco but I thought he would show some nervousness at Utd.

916~~~
Saved us again. Great composure.

917~~~
Saved us?

918~~~
Well not exactly <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> but feck it he scored

919~~~
Racist.

920~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Great finish, let's hope he can win us the game because nobody else looks like they're going to.

921~~~
Signing of the season is starting to look a little more obvious bit by bit. Such composure.

922~~~
He didn't "save us" last time either, he scored the 3rd in a 3-1 win...

923~~~
Do the French really believe he'll win the Ballon D'Or one day?

924~~~
Post of the day <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Amazing how a teenager can come and be the only guy in this team to have a creative and imaginative spark.

925~~~
I loved that dribble a few minutes prior to the goal. We've not had a central dribbler for a while now.

926~~~
Is Anthony Martial a Manchester United legend?

927~~~
Quickly becoming a key player for us. Great composure for the goal.

928~~~
It was tight though...it sealed it for us.

929~~~
Easily our best striker.

930~~~
It looked like it was going to be a nervy last ten mins against Liverpool and he scored. Today we were absolutely hopeless until he scored

931~~~
Nah. He is a very rated talent and that's about it (which is already great IMO).

932~~~
A few such performances more and everybody would sure forget about the price. WHAT A PLAYER! He can seriously become very good.

933~~~
He's like the match lighting at the start of Mission Impossible!

That cold comspure in front of goal shall earn him the nickname 'Black Ice' one slip and he punishes you!.....I'll get my coat.

934~~~
Indeed. Suppose we'll have to hope he develops into a world beater.

935~~~
Martial needs to score a lot more goals before I'll forgive him for those boots.

936~~~
Where are all the OP fans who were on here when we signed him saying what a waste of money he is?

937~~~
Smiles less than Valencia.

938~~~
It's not just when he has the ball at feet, the way he will working the channels is impressive as well.

939~~~
So far so good. I always stated that I need Martial to have a season like Januzaj or even better for me to start believing his hype. He looks like the real deal, but I feel we can still get better from him if he plays a more free role. Playing him alongside Rooney seems more like a hindrance so far.

940~~~
This kid is looking like the real deal. Or should I say the Real deal.

941~~~
I think they're busy editing their posts.

942~~~
Indeed. I had faith in him all along and I genuinely believe he's going to be one of the word's best players.

943~~~
I could get used to him scoring for fun

944~~~
Yeah that was a good moment. 

Took 5 players out of the game. 

Just lacked the final ball. Maybe should've taken it on more himself. Causes panic in defenders.

945~~~
So what do people think, 4 or 5 seasons before he's off Madrid?

946~~~
Amazing. That's all that needs to be said.

947~~~
My doubts are fading. This guy looks a real deal.

948~~~
I bet he's already agreeing his contract,  the traitor

949~~~
Everyone who has seen Martial before has been adamant that he actually is good whatever the price tag is. His composure in front of goal has been great.

950~~~
He's an absolute assassin in the box so far. So, so much composure! Also his movement has been really good I thought, drawing defenders out of position at times. Really liking the look of him.

951~~~
Can we just assume from now on that this has already been said about any foreign young player we have signed and everyone found it hilarious. 

Just to save you the bother of clicking through loads of green smilies.

952~~~
I'd imagine Henry at a similar age was the same? Great potential but not seen as a "best in the world" type of talent. Also Ronaldo in his one trick pony days.....nobody could expect him to be the player he is. Impossible to tell with most young players

953~~~
Macheda scored the week after his first goal as well, proves nothing.

<span style="color: #ffffff"><img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/></span>

954~~~
Has been miles better than I expected. I didn't really expect him to be much around the first team this season - mostly cup appearances and cameos. But he has shown that he is ready.

The really promising thing is not just that he is talented, but he is so mature, composed and unfazed. You see plenty of exciting youngsters, but to see one who has slotted in so easily is pretty rare.

955~~~
Quick, calm and an eye for goal.  He might be pretty special.

Cautiously optimistic, but I like what I've seen so far.

956~~~
The Macheda comparisons are tiresome too. Macheda had nothing to his game other than being a good finisher. Anyone with half a brain cell can tell that they are nothing like each other.

Martial looks very intelligent. His runs are great and he's leading the line at 19 years of age.

957~~~
Exactly. It only takes some ridiculous talents (Messi for instance) to make projections like that.

958~~~
But I like the green smiles!

On topic, the thing that impresses me most about the guy is how nothing seems to be fazing him. He also seems quite dominant in the air which is an option we lack, anything thats stops us needing to throw Fellaini up top is a massive plus.

959~~~
I thought Henry was all pace and nowt else.

960~~~
Now you guys see why I said that next summer he would have joined the likes of Barcelona or Real Madrid.

961~~~
Henry was compared to Trezeguet who was already a goalscorer.

962~~~
What composure!

Martial!

963~~~
I'm in love

964~~~
What a waste of money.

965~~~
Ruthless.

966~~~
Neville just said it perfectly, you were never in doubt.

967~~~
Ice in his veins.

968~~~
Ice cold in front of goal. Super start.

969~~~
19 years old <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

970~~~
Well, I'm in love.

971~~~
What a feeling!

This is something special - savor it.

972~~~
Cold as ice. Zero fecks given from birth.

Awesome.

973~~~
Does he still look like Welbeck <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

974~~~
Best player in the league <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

975~~~
He's class. So happy about this signing.

976~~~
I wonder if Gaz still thinks that Martial was a 'desperate' signing

977~~~
Never in doubt!

978~~~
Who is this guy?! How did noone know about him before.

979~~~
Looks like we will end up paying the full 80 million!

980~~~
Cool as feck

981~~~
If anyone puts him in their fantasy team I will personally hunt them down and remove their heart.

982~~~
TBF he wasnt the only one who said that

983~~~
Build him a statue next to SAF outside Old Trafford please.

984~~~
Exactly what we have been missing over the last two years, bit of magic to make things happen and clinical finishing.

985~~~
We're witnessing the birth of a superstar.

986~~~
Welbeck apparently. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

987~~~
As good as he is, and i believe he's something special. What does it say about the EPL that a 19 year old who wasn't prolific in the french league can come here and instantly look like one of the best forwards in the league.

988~~~
The welbeck comparison is looking stupider by the minute

989~~~
Martial's finishing these past 2 games has been ice cold. Showing Rooney how to play.

990~~~
already better than welbeck

991~~~
Still can't get around my head how a teenager can be so cool and confident.

992~~~
That's why they shouldnt comment about signings they know nothing about. Posters who actually watch the French league <a class="username" data-user="26211, @kouroux" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/26211/">@kouroux</a> and <a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a> were both saying he's an excellent player

993~~~
The scouts have done really well on this one, was never in the picture as a potential signing.

994~~~
What a player! 3 Goals in about 90 min of PL football!

995~~~
Making himself undroppable with the threat he is providing.

996~~~
What's that, 3 goals in ~75 minutes in the PL?

Not bad <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

997~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

998~~~
Saviour

999~~~
Ice Cold Killa

1000~~~
Only in the sense that we were desperate to sign him and seemingly for good reasons.

1001~~~
seriously?

1002~~~
Worried he was a bit of a panic signing - he's exactly why we've needed for a good few years now

1003~~~
I just love how he keeps the ball glued to the pitch. The intention was there even with Liverpool goal.

1004~~~
You were hardly singing from the rooftops when we signed him, where you?

1005~~~
He's as cool as Cantona and he's only 19

1006~~~
Yeah but they were flabbergasted at the amount we paid. But who cares he's certainly got...it.

1007~~~
I never expected 3 goals in 2 games if I'm being honest. It's like he's still at Monaco in his head, playing so calmly.

1008~~~
Yeah he's started his United career like Eric and all.

1009~~~
He is

1010~~~
I was, just like everyone. It was a lot of money but it'll be totally forgotten with good performances. The surprise is a natural reaction.

1011~~~
He made it look like we were throwing money to everybody until we found someone who finally accepted them. There again Gaz still thinks that selling the only striker United had ever had with the Neville's finishing touch to Arsenal was a mistake

1012~~~
Someone correct me but did his 14 Monoco goals come in the second half of last season?

1013~~~
Am I alone in seeing the Welbeck comparisons, in the sense that he's pretty much looking like the player we always hoped Welbeck would become?

He looks just like Welbeck + composure - which if he is, is a bloody good player.

1014~~~
To be fair, these 3rd kits are pretty similar to Monaco's black kit with white shorts that they used against Valencia

1015~~~
No one can predict that. You said he was a quality player and you were right.

1016~~~
Think it was 8 or 9 but yeah, had like 8 or 9 in his last 12ish

1017~~~
So is he the next Mame Diouf or more like van Nistelrooy?

1018~~~
He scored ten goals in the last games, iirc.

1019~~~
Yeah, agreeing with you. All seem to suggest that we were desperate to sign him and simply paid what we had to, although far more than we wanted to.

1020~~~
Told you guys he would be a brilliant signing!  <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1021~~~
He's neither one nor the other

1022~~~
Nah, he's like Henry. Wellbeck was about industry and endeavour.

1023~~~
That's a natural reaction when you're buying potential for top money. The same things were said in the past about Shaw and Ronaldo. However that doesn't make them desperate signings

1024~~~
He's a bit good isn't he? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1025~~~
Memphis has wilted a bit in his shadow.

1026~~~
His first touch is exceptional. Reminds of Ronaldo/Van Persie how efficiently he takes it out.

1027~~~
He understands the philosophy I think

1028~~~
He also fits de profile.

1029~~~
I take back everything I said about the transfer <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1030~~~
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1031~~~
He's a process. A mini-phenomena if you like.

1032~~~
I honestly thought we'd lose today. Fantastic day in the end. Nobody could have ever predicted this start from Martial. Phenomenal talent.

1033~~~
Yep. I must've said things like 'you pay that much for a freakishly good talents not just good ones' about 5-6 times.

He's a freakishly good talent.

1034~~~
Football Manager was right, for once.

1035~~~
From little i have seen from Martial and Depay i must say that Martial is a better player at this moment. More mature with better inteligence.

1036~~~
he's a bit good isn't he?

1037~~~
Was he really any good on FM? Still.....it's quite often right.

1038~~~
He's scaring the shit out of defenders. Going to have to get used to being kicked to pieces <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1039~~~
He scored 70 goals in my last season... He's alright

1040~~~
I can actually see Fergie coming back just to work with him. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1041~~~
I never panic when he gets the ball, I always know he'll do the right thing which is unreal for a lad his age. 
He is composure personified, and with the ball at his feet I always think he's going to do something positive.

1042~~~
Oh yeah, always signed him when I could, tore leagues and Europe to bits for me many a time.

Edit: He's
so, perhaps actually a tad underrated in FM.
True,  I'm just messing about.

1043~~~
Gotta say it again. His dribbling from central areas is an absolute joy to watch

1044~~~
This kid is ridiculous.  His attitude is just like "next...."

1045~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1046~~~
Bless him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1047~~~
He's a good Samaritan as well

1048~~~
now he's healing cripples. he can do anything.

1049~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Manager will have a word about that.

1050~~~
Black Jesus.

1051~~~
I love him.

Which considering he's like 10 years younger then me is a bit dirty... but I don't care dammit.

1052~~~
Missed that bit, what happened?

1053~~~
Saint Martial

1054~~~
From Welbeck to Jesus - story of Anthony <b>Martian</b>.

1055~~~
Southampton defender goes down with cramp. Martial stretches his leg for him, whilst play goes on for quite a while.

1056~~~
He made it look effortless. He's good at finishing it low instead of just blasting it.

1057~~~
it seems there was 2 welbecks : training ground welbeck and match day welbeck. Match Day Welbeck couldn't finish to save his life <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> And lets not forget the knee problems.

1058~~~
He heals who he wants.

1059~~~
Haha, what a guy.

1060~~~
Amazing

1061~~~
Is it too early to get a tattoo?

1062~~~
Looks like exactly what we needed up front. Someone who is lively, pacy and can run in behind the defence like Hernandez, but who also has good holdup play and strength.

1063~~~
His play is really mature for his age. Knows when to hold his position. Every other 19 year old would've been shooting every chance they got when on a hat trick but he still held the ball up and brought others into play.

1064~~~
Great goals and what a man helping Van Djk out!

1065~~~
I want my nickname changed to Thierry Martial <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1066~~~
He reminds me of Anelka somehow.

1067~~~
Great stuff, showing maturity beyond his years. Start him in the 9 role every week.

1068~~~
If no one knew who he was . We are beginning to see what he's about now. And only 19.

1069~~~
I'm really starting to like him. I love how ice cold he is, yet he seems like a nice lad.

What a waste of money indeed <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1070~~~
He's ace. So composed, athletic, and pretty technically gifted. Weaving past defenders for fun at the minute.

1071~~~
So now we know the club hasn't completely lost it's marbles and forked 37m out for the next Danny Welbeck. 

All jokes aside, we finally have another superstar on our hands, I feel.

1072~~~
Name Old Trafford after him.

1073~~~
Me too. More than Henry I'd say.

1074~~~
He doesn't play like a 19 year old. Don't think he ever gave the ball away and he is unbelievably calm when he gets a chance. So happy we signed him

1075~~~
The best thing about is him is how oblivious he is to everything. So nonchalant, he's got those slightly dopey eyes too.

1076~~~
He's a football robot.

1077~~~
Yes, more Saha, Anelka than Henry for me.

1078~~~
Looking too good to be true

Don't want to get excited about him yet

1079~~~
I love how emotionless he is about everything. Even when he's celebrating a goal his smile seems forced. The only time he looked genuinely happy was when he got in that row with that Southampton player. The dead face, the swagger he has around the pitch, the cockiness and arrogance he's already shown - we have a star.

And £58m would be cheap at double the price if it means we get to watch Martial up front instead of Rooney.

1080~~~
He is the real deal! We might even have to pay all the bonus payments for him if he keeps going like this.

1081~~~
He's really feckin' good.

1082~~~
Love him. 

So calm and composed. Excellent.

1083~~~
Agree a with mixture of Saha but more of Benzema for me than Anelka

1084~~~
Don't want to go over the top, as its obviously still only 3 games, but he looks fantastic for someone so young with so much pressure on his shoulders. If him and Memphis continue to grow their relationship, we could have something big on our hands!

1085~~~
Oh crap, we might be forced to pay that full fee after all.

1086~~~
He even heals the sick!

1087~~~
I need to say it again Ranieri and Jardim did a great work with him, two very good coaches.

1088~~~
Complete CF performance. What a gem.

1089~~~
feck it, he's just Martial then <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1090~~~
don't want to bash Roo, but the difference in threat is unreal.

Brought down twice in the last 15 due to his pace and movement causing problems.
Roo wouldn't have got anywhere near the box in the same moves

1091~~~
Put him in my fantasy team. He looks absolutely class against PSV, if only in contained periods. Did me proud today!!

1092~~~
Thank god we got him. We have lacked pace upfront for too long.  Arsenal fans must be very disappointed Wenger wasn't in for him.

1093~~~
He reminds me a lot of players, that will seem knee jerk but he has the best qualities of a lot of world class strikers Aguero, Henry, Lewandowski or Benzema.

1094~~~
Think we might end up paying 60 million very soon. Brilliant performance. I still cannot believe how composed he fecking is.

1095~~~
Everyone give a round of applause to the daily mail, for writing the worst prediction this year.

1096~~~
One of the fee might be number of players he healed on pitch.

1097~~~
His composure is fantastic.

1098~~~
The composure he showed today <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
Brilliant player.

1099~~~
He was a panic buy, alright. But the only people panicking are the opposition's defenders!!!11LOL

Great start from the young man though.

1100~~~
He was <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1101~~~
I've just realised who he reminds me of. He's the football version of Kawhi Leonard

1102~~~
Can't ask for any more than than he's delivered so far, cool as ice in front of goal and some really strong and quick all round play.

1103~~~
Nah Anelka was more of a speedster. Martial is more technically gifted with better control ie a Henry or at least a Saha

1104~~~
Loved it when the United fans were singing what a waste of money after his second goal! He's got a long way to go but he is bang on form right now and should continue to start premier league games for us.

1105~~~
Is it redundant to say that the great Hurrykane has yet to score a goal for Spurs this season?

1106~~~
He reminds me of Benzema.

1107~~~
Extremely cool finishing for a teenager and may have possibly a bigger potential than Paolo Dybala. We'll see how he'll develop further but for now, Viva Le Martial !

1108~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1109~~~
Saha is more appropriate yes.

1110~~~
He will either score or give the ball away, luckily today he done the former.

1111~~~
Anyone got a clip of his first touch around minute 64? Almost Berbatov like.

1112~~~
This.

I hope he's rested on wednesday and starts on saturday.

1113~~~
This. Though I won't mind if he keeps getting them goals.

1114~~~
"£20m? no thanks"

1115~~~
Always hard not to get carried away when a young player starts like this. Certainly doesn't look "raw" like all the naysayers were insisting. Has a bit of an aura about him. Not just the goals he's getting either, his ability to go past people and combine with others is very promising. He's 19 ffs.

1116~~~
I'm actually glad I knew next to nothing about him when he signed. It's made it all so much more magical.

1117~~~
Brilliant so far. Exactly the dynamic #9 we've needed.

1118~~~
Best outfield player for us by a mile; so much composure for such a young lad. I'm surprised Rooney didn't catch on to the amount of headers he were winning too.

1119~~~
C O L D

1120~~~
We need Rooney and Depay to take a punt on him winning a header and running past him when we have a goal kick

1121~~~
He's been so impressive so far. I just hope we all understand he's still a kid if/when his form take a dip.

But no matter what, with hte start he's made, he can go through a period of poor form without the media jumping on his back. He's really taken the pressure off himself. 

He just makes us look so much more dangerous up top. It's great to see. We are far more dynamic now with him and Depay in attack.

1122~~~
The Caf'll still manage it.

1123~~~
Without Rooney on the pitch bastardising every attack we had he'd have had ample opportunities for a hat trick.

1124~~~
Great to see him leading the line. Good composure and an eye for goal.

1125~~~
Best waste of money we have ever spent.

1126~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1127~~~
Indeed <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1128~~~
Love the guy

1129~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1130~~~
Turns out we have the best summer signings by a distance.

1131~~~
um , he's scoring for fun.

1132~~~
It's not as if it was just the goals today either. What a talent!

1133~~~
We're more rutless than any tabloid.

1134~~~
Great, great talent. The price still seems ridicoulus but I can totally see why we wanted him at all cost.

1135~~~
Trying not to get too excited, but he looks like the real deal. Two super finishes today.

1136~~~
Am I right in thinking men generally grow until 21? Is he 5 ft 11 now? May grow my an inch or two more yet

1137~~~
I knew we were in for a treat when we signed him. I can't say that I had watched every single Monaco game, but I had seen enough of him to get very excited when the stories about our interest started emerging in the French press. 

He was brilliant today. Great hold up play, great technique and overall a really intelligent player. Makes very smart runs and is always available for a pass. He's also a strong lad and doesn't get bullied by the opposition defenders. 

The most impressive thing so far has been his coolness and composure in front of goal, though. Three brilliantly worked goals so far.

1138~~~
After having a front three of highly paid has-beens last season, it's great to have genuine pace and directness again. Of our rivals in the PL, only City have someone more dangerous.

1139~~~
Souness won't say it but he loves him.

1140~~~
Nothing better as a United fan than seeing young players blossom from relative obscurity. 

Much much better scenario than signing expensive superstars who can only disappoint if they meet massive expectation.

1141~~~
you forgot to add panic buy. 

This boy is a special talent and i think it is true other teams were sniffing around him.

1142~~~
Now that was a good performance <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1143~~~
According to some, he's no bigger a talent to James Wilson.

1144~~~

1145~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1146~~~
Who would have thought that he's such a brilliant talent. Not everything is coming off but he can only get better! Today he did so many things right and scoring two goals is brilliant for him. On current form should play instead of Rooney, that's for sure

1147~~~
Martial for Man United

80 minutes - 3 Goals

Falcao:

1275 minutes - 4 Goals

1148~~~
I knew he had a shit ton of potential, I thought he might surprise a few people this season...but to do what he's done, so early into his career here, is fecking astounding. I'm still in shock at that bit of skill for the first goal. Such composure.

1149~~~
So happy for the lad.  He's so laid back he's practically asleep half the time. Ice in his veins.

"What a waste of money" <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1150~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1151~~~
Got to give a lot of credit to Van Gaal for having the balls to make this transfer.

1152~~~
Hang on. I'm sure I read somewhere our transfer window was terrible and an embarrassment.

1153~~~
That must be given to either Ronaldo or DDG

1154~~~
And there was no need to show them this time round

1155~~~
The thing is, you can come up with whatever excuses for Falcao but there aren't really any.

This lad's pace has been better, his positioning, his finishing, his link up play, everything. The sum of that equation is scoring goals.

1156~~~
Rooney : ~1000 mins - 0 Goals.
Bring Falcao BACK

1157~~~
He looks so good. Three in two in this team is actually quite impressive! He's got all the attributes required to be an absolutely top talent, and he's cemented a first team place in about 45 minutes of league football. I cannot wait to see this guy at his top level.

1158~~~
Everytime he will score this season I will remember Peter Drury shouting "The boy can play"after the goal vs Liverpool

1159~~~
If he'd been doing what he's doing at the age of 25 h would still be great. The fact that he's just 19 is a bit frightening. Can't wait to see what he does for us in the future.

1160~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/5MY6L5c.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/5MY6L5c.png"/> The Daily Mirror knows.

1161~~~
Still early days, but he looks great. I really like his style. What surprised me the most is his hold up play which is more than decent.

1162~~~
Looking great so far. It's superb to see that he doesn't look at all phased with the fact that he's at a completely new club in a new setting. He's fast, clinical and looks like he's got the potential to be an excellent all-round striker. Just offers so much more in attack than someone like Rooney does at the moment.

1163~~~
I am slowly starting to believe the hype, as such does anyone else think he can go on and have the same goal scoring/overall performance season Harry Kane had for Spurs last term?

A difference is that we are not building our team around Martial like Spurs did with Kane last season, so their will be less emphasis in getting him the ball, which could lower his overall output.

1164~~~
Pace, we have some!

For the first time since Ronaldo left, we have pace (with skill).

1165~~~
He's our best forward.

1166~~~
Listening to Neville (from earlier on after the match) saying that we have to be careful how much we play him and that he should only be eased him, but I'm struggling to agree with him on it. Granted, we don't want to tire him out by playing him constantly, but he fully deserves to play, irrespective of how young he may be.

1167~~~
Yeah I agree with that. He fully deserves more play time and it looks like nothing phases him at all.

Neville did make a point that we shouldn't be saying he could be one of the greatest, despite only playing 3 games. Which I agree with. Sooner or later he'll hit a drought and people will get on his back again since they're expecting he'll consistently score in every other game, thanks to all of the annoying Henry comparisons.

1168~~~
And so far isn't a cnut. A person like Costa would probably have been stomping on van Djik and then screaming at him to get up. Looking good so far - after only 3 games. There will undoubtedly be a period where he isn't playing well and a lot will be written about it then, people waiting to slam down the waste of money. Be very important how both him and LVG handle it when that time comes. With the way Martial has been on the pitch though, would expect to just be icy cool about it.

1169~~~
Yeah, I do fully agree with that. I think he looks excellent so far and could potentially be a top player, but obviously we'll need to see him over an extended period of time to judge how good he really is going to be. Best way to judge it will be for him to play, though.

1170~~~
TBF in an ideal world we'd be taking him out of the line of fire for a few weeks and lowering expectations.

But sadly Rooney is dogshit and we've left ourselves with no other options upfront.

1171~~~
He seems like a natural goal scorer, very clinical and calm. He seems to know what to do and how to finish even before he has received the ball.

1172~~~
Neville was chatting shit there - Rooney and Ronaldo were playing day in and day out when they came here. If a players ready, he is ready. And Martial looks more than ready, physically and mentally he looks solid.

1173~~~
Martial and Memphis - the new Rooney and Ronaldo. I'm officially excited.

1174~~~
I dunno, I'm not sure I agree. Anyone with a rational mind will know that we have to be careful with our expectations of him. Martial's age shouldn't hold him back from being our main striker if he's performing well and scoring goals for us. I'd rather we have more options up front, but even if we did, I'd see no reason for us not to play Martial right now.

1175~~~
Did Fergie take Rooney out of the firing line and lower expectations? Where does this thinking even come from?

1176~~~
Yeah, I often feel that with the exception of players who are late bloomers, <i>most </i>top, world class talents generally start getting a lot of playing time at a very young age, with Rooney and Ronaldo being examples since they were already playing regularly when they were even younger than Martial.

1177~~~
Let loose Randy, allow yourself to enjoy it, it's the whole point of watching <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1178~~~
Pretty much. Shown more in his two appearances in the league than the captain has all season.

1179~~~
Leave him out midweek vs Ipswich and hopefully haul him off after an hour vs Sunderland. (On the basis he scored a goal or two)

1180~~~
The thing i noticed about him is that he wins a lot of headers from goal kicks and long balls, I think he won 7 ariel duels today, that is a very good stat. I like his understanding with mata and memphis , Rooney is poor and i'd rather we had januzaj/herrera playing behind him to give him through balls. I hope our current players take advantage of his good ariel ability.

1181~~~
I'd agree with resting him for the Ipswich game (perhaps even give Wilson a shot), but if he's performing well against Sunderland I'd be happy for him to get another full game under his belt.

1182~~~
He must look at that everyday for inspiration.

1183~~~
You can't learn how to finish in my opinion, you either have it or you don't.

1184~~~
Depends on the scoreline, I'd want him fresh for the CL game on the Wednesday.

1185~~~
True, although I imagine that he'd be fine to play two games within the space of a few days.

1186~~~
I hope he printed out a large poster of it and stuck it on the ceiling above his bed.

1187~~~
I'm still finding it hard to believe he's only 19. Fecking 19!

1188~~~
He looks the real deal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1189~~~
Agreed, he put his neck on the line with this won and a lot of people were laughing at him. Not laughing now I bet.

This guy looks the real deal. I don't think i'd swap him for even Aguero or Costa his potential is miles bigger.

1190~~~
I've said it before but I think he's got everything that you can't learn or teach. All he needs now is the experience and the nous that comes from age and playing time.

1191~~~
Miles better than Aguero?! I'm excited about Martial, as my posts have shown, but it's certainly too early to say he'll be better than Aguero considering he's one of the best strikers around at the moment.

1192~~~
For practicing his English <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1193~~~
He doesn't look the type to get exhausted.  He's not broke a sweat yet.
Very impressed how he doesn't needlessly waste energy but at the same time is bright as a button.  

Very very impressed

1194~~~
Didn't expect him to be so cool in front of goal.

Also, love the ease with which he goes past players. Something we sorely lack in attack.

1195~~~
Yeah, I mean don't get me wrong, he's certainly going to need to be rested at certain points to avoid fatigue, but I don't think we should be playing him any less than the other important players in our team at the moment.

1196~~~
Let's hope he helps us win a trophy like Kahwi did for spurs

1197~~~
I wonder what odds you could get on him becoming United's all time top goalscorer...

1198~~~
Ronaldo and Messi both did.

1199~~~
It's also rather frightening to think what we'd be looking at going forward if we hadn't signed this lad. Being a so called 'desperation buy' and all that.

Let's not beat around the bush, he's our one big hope for the season in terms of scoring the goals we need to be successful.

That's kind of strange for United to be in that situation.

1200~~~
Early days, but i think we have found our new top striker for the next decade or so.

1201~~~
Him and Depay, Depay hasn't shown consistency yet but ye has shown moments of sheer brilliance, both will score important goals this season.

1202~~~
Agree here. What happened to "if your good enough, your old enough"? Any player can suffer from burnout or slump in form. If anything, Martial has shown more maturity this season than Rooney has done!

He is a confident lad, settling in fairly well and in good form. Deserves his place and doesn't need protection so far, he is strong enough both physically and mentally to keep playing. Showed that with his 2 well taken goals today. 30 minutes into the game where he wasn't involved much to produce that goal, and to read a passback and ease it past the keeper.

1203~~~
Most top players all started playing in the first team from a very young age. If you're good enough, you're old enough.

1204~~~
He scores goals... which is something our other strikers seem to have forgotten how to do.

1205~~~
Hm. Giggs was managed and Owen exposed in their early years. He needs rest time and recovery. Definitely.

1206~~~
What a start for the kid. Brilliant composure on both goals. Gives us pace, skill and running power we've lacked for awhile.

1207~~~
Rooney played every game because he was a physical anomaly from a very young age.

Ronaldo was managed by Fergie though. He started quite a few games from the bench in his early days.

It didn't fully come together for Ronaldo until the second half of the 05/06 season.

1208~~~
Just said the same thing in another thread, Need to pray he stays fit, otherwise we are going to find it hard to score.

1209~~~
It's a physical thing rather than a reflection on his ability, ideally you want to be able to prepare a player slowly and allow him plenty of rest periods, however this season we don't really have that option.

1210~~~
Must be fantastic for him to enjoy such a great start to his career with United. It's almost unreal. Hopefully he can keep scoring.

1211~~~
Owen's just one example, though.

And Giggs wasn't particularly protected: he played 51 games in the 1991/1992 season, and 46 the next season. He was already a regular starter for us by the time he was in his late teens. Ronaldo was given plenty of opportunities at a young age, and flourished, without deteriorating too quickly. Same with Messi. Same with Aguero. Same with Rooney, even if he's looking a lot poorer now.

Some players wear out early, although that can often be more down to injury than anything else. Some players just naturally peak early. But the majority of top players generally start to get lots of opportunities in their late-teens. Martial should be no different, especially since he's playing well. I'd understand holding him back more if he was only 16 or 17, but at 19 he should be given plenty of playing time considering the hype around him.

1212~~~
Giving the keeper the eyes (from reddit):

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://i.imgur.com/vk5wfb3.jpg" src="https://i.imgur.com/vk5wfb3.jpg"/>

1213~~~
Are we sure he's 19? He hasn't forged his papers?

Such maturity in his play and composure in front of goal at that age is astonishing. Plus he's got a solid build and is damn strong.

Exciting times <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1214~~~
Indeed.

I don't agree at all with this modern idea that young players need to be eased in carefully in order to prevent them from burning out faster when they are older. If distance runners adopted this philosophy, they would never reach the elite level. East African runners in particular are known to put in crazy mileages at an early age and they are not only known for being the best runners at their peak age but also for running at a high level well into their 30s and 40s.

Obviously if a player starts playing regular football at an earlier age than his peers he is more likely to pick up injuries by the age of 30 and <i>might </i>be worse off for it, but you could make the same point about a player at any age. If you took a 25 year old player and halved his playing time between the age of 25-27, he might on average notch up fewer injuries by the time he is 30 and as a result be in a slighter better physical condition than if he had played all the games in this period, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea.

1215~~~
<a class="username" data-user="36088, @Kraftwerker" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/36088/">@Kraftwerker</a> is correct, Ronaldo started 15 league games and came on as a sub in 14 league games in his first season.

1216~~~
Martial looks physically ready though doesn't he? 

Ronaldo wasnt strong enough at first, but even then, he had around 20 or more starts in his first couple years with us.

1217~~~
Plagiature.

1218~~~
He does, which is one of the most encouraging things.

I'm just worried about us already becoming too reliant on him (and another young player in Depay) to constantly find the bullets for us.

I think Rooney was maybe overplayed a bit as youngster and is suffering for it now with a premature physical decline. 

Still I think you should always play your best players to win the game and Martial is certainly looking like one of our best players.

1219~~~
Martial plays the game very economically. He doesn't waste too much energy chasing lost causes, tracking back or contesting decisions. He appears to almost play within himself but comes alive the second he gets possession. I really don't see a problem with him continuing too start. A younger Rooney or Giggs and you could sense potential problems with over exposure although both dealt with it fantastically well. I suppose  at 19 an eye will have to be kept on his development  from boy to man perhaps ensuring that the same  problems that Welbeck had don't resurface but at the  minute he is undroppable.

1220~~~
He's proving he can cope with pressure and has the composure to score goals at this level. Being so young he'll not always be consistent. However, he does have the talent and will only improve with time.

His biggest test of temperament will come when things do not go well.

1221~~~
Is it too soon to give him a 'fecking' as his middle name.

1222~~~
So glad for him! Perhaps even more than he is for himself by the looks of things <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1223~~~
I thought it was the caf joke of the hour? I didn't make it for the record, saw it in the matchday thread.

1224~~~
The only player from the top 4 teams to have 3 or more goals in the league <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1225~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1226~~~
Was about to say, has more goals then Aguero, Costa, Rooney, Giroud, Sturridge, Benteke or Kane <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> With only just over 100 minutes played.

1227~~~
Anything think he could play next to Wilson? Or will it be the case of Martial drifting out to the wing to let Wilson do his stuff in the middle?

1228~~~
What a great start for him. He'll be riding such a wave of confidence right now. Hopefully he can keep scoring.

1229~~~
I'm not going to pretend like I remember what those 2 looked liked in front of goal when they were 19. Martial stats were  nothing special but the kid is lighting up the eye test. These aren't brave headers or scrambled tap ins he's scoring.

1230~~~
Wilson can play wide and his physic is more suited for the wide areas.

1231~~~
I honestly think that we'll even see Rooney banging them in soon now that the attacking burden is lifted. It's just so good to have a striker that can finish and can link up play again. I wonder if he'll soon be mentioned in the same breath as the likes of Aguero, Benzema and the rest in 2-3 years. Who knows, maybe he'll surpass them.

1232~~~
So, anyone backing him for young player of the year? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1233~~~
Diego Costa.

1234~~~
Could easily do it. Early days but if he keeps on doing what he's doing - then certainly.

His composure is unreal. I actually started celebrating before he even shot his second goal. I have so much confidence in him when one on one. How many shots has he had for us now? About 5 maximum surely. Scored 3 from them.

1235~~~
Martial seems best as a lone striker, or with a second striker as a #10 behind him (like a Rooney from a few years ago). Wilson is a poacher and you can't really have two of them. Martial is capable of going deeper and all that, but you want him leading the line. He's very similar to Aguero in terms of his type of striker, and you wouldn't play Aguero next to another poacher as it takes away from his game.

1236~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/anthony-martial-will-be-a-flop-for-manchester-united-says-ray-parlour-10493107.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...chester-united-says-ray-parlour-10493107.html</a>

1237~~~
Martial is a few weeks from 20 with first team experiance from France and the CL.
He isn't  a 17 year old just breaking through. Just because he's a young player for us doesn't mean we should treat him the same way we treated Giggs etc. I bet Giggs / Ronaldo and Rooney were starting more games around their 20th birthday than being 'eased and managed'

1238~~~
This guy is pure class and has such maturity for a 19 year old, confident but not arrogant. Hope he continues to prove the doubters wrong all season.

1239~~~
His all round play is the most impressive thing. Runs down the channels with strength and speed, has great close control when dribbling with the ball, holds the ball with strength. He's basically the perfect striker for us and the one we've been wanting for the past couple of years. Very surprised by how good the signing is looking right now

1240~~~
That little fake turn for the first goal, Ice cold. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1241~~~
He's going to become one of my current favorites, we've really been starved of a proper #9 since RvP in 12/13.

1242~~~
It's amazing how cool and composed he is in front of the goal. Especially considering that he is only 19 years old.

1243~~~
He had the Berba school at Monaco. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1244~~~
I'm sure Neville suffers from acute imposter syndrome.

1245~~~
Is it too soon to plaster his name on the back of my shirt yet?

1246~~~
Can I ask, are you named after the JPRouve off Les Robins des Bois? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1247~~~
You can't just box himself together in a neat little package along with all other 19 year old you have to look at him individually.

He has a calm head on his shoulders, he's already physically matured so no growing pains, he's more than athletic enough for the league, knows how to play the position properly and seems to already have the right mentality. To me that says he's ready to regularly lead the line for us, too much emphasis is put on age these days. <span style="color: #ffffff">(Careful!)</span>

1248~~~
Yeah, the greatest french ever.<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1249~~~
He's absolute magic. Just a class above.

We have a star here, we really do. His composure is unreal.

1250~~~
Also only 1 behind Liverpool <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1251~~~
He doesn't look fussed at all being a 19 year old kid coming to Man Utd with a huge Price tag, which is great.

Long may his form continue.

1252~~~
Watching it again on MOTD. He just doesn't give a feck in front of goal does he? At no point does the thought of missing seem to cross his mind.

1253~~~
Let him loose against Ipswich I say. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

1254~~~
In all of his minutes so far, I've yet to see him snatch at any action he's made, be it a pass or a shot. Even if things don't come off, the intent and idea behind it is clear and apparent. There's not only composure in there, but also a speed of thought and ability to process the game rapidly in a way where his final action always looks like he has all the time in the world.

All his goals so far have involved intricacy and a functional process where if you slow down the action of the play you see all the nuance before the ball hits the back of the net. You won't find that in many strikers around, so to have 'it' at 19 years old makes it clear this kid is a special talent. He looks like the type who can pick and choose the best option for each scenario and it will be interesting to see the range of goals and attempts he makes over the course of the season.

The biggest problem we might have with him is actually pulling him from games and giving him the breaks from our starting xi that teenagers generally need, because, as a player, irrespective of age, he gives us everything we need in a lead the line striker, so much so that people might forget this is a kid who needs to avoid burnout.

He's going to have a respect and fear factor to him if he keeps going at defenses in the way he's done to Liverpool and Southampton. The most dangerous and clever element to his running is the way that once he gets beyond a player, he cuts straight across them, meaning they're at risk of a red or yellow immediately if they try to challenge him on their wrong side. If he keeps doing what he's shown in his brief time in the PL, opposition managers are going to have to cater to his game in short order, which will benefit the rest of the team immensely.

Another thing that seems to be apparent is that his one-touch and link-up ability is better than what we have here - he looks like he can ping balls back and forth all day and he makes the appropriate runs off the ball to receive and go again, and again. He really looks like the type who would thrive with a proper and competent #10 behind him.


It's quite astonishing that this random kid most of the caf knew nothing about has just popped up and looks like such a polished all-round player straight out the gate. I wasn't expecting anything like the player we've got and little by little I'm wondering what the actual holes in his game are as he looks ridiculously competent to this point in time.

I wonder how LVG will manage fan expectations if Martial keeps performing like this.

1255~~~
At a loss to explain how 1) I had never heard of him before he joined for us, and 2) why he only completed 90 minutes five times in his career!

The guy is unbelievable. Hats off to Woody and LVG for having the balls to spend this much on a 19 year old. Thats not guessing he was going to be good - like Nani or Anderson, that was a statement of "This guy is for sure one of the best players in the world in a few years". To be that sure deserves huge credit because he is absolute mustard. He barely scored for Monaco, Wenger said he was a winger and then we go and stick him as a lone striker and he performs like he's been playing the role for 10 years.. And he's 19! Incredible.

1256~~~
I'm looking forward to next week. He's started a couple of tough away games and had a sub appearance at OT against a rival. Sunderland at home should be a game we dominate and win comfortabley so it will be exciting to see what he can do in a game with a bit more freedom.

1257~~~
He's so great, I want to start a thread to discuss him even though I'm in a thread that is discussing him. He deserves his own sub forum. FrenchCafe. We can talk about Cantona in there as well.

1258~~~
I'd agree they're both very talented but I have only seen Martial in an United shirt three times and have been impressed whereas I've watched Wilson loads underage and he is a special talent too.

If both reach their potential we will have a world class front 2 for many years to come.

No idea how you've never heard of him, or how so many haven't really. He's been a very highly rated youngster for a while and is an FM legend too. Why he only completed 90 minutes 8 times or whatever it was before he joined United was because he was 18 and turned 19 last season. Pretty easy to see why. Also his goalscoring record isn't bad. It's just he was 18 years old. Find me an 18 year old with a good goalscoring record... They don't exist. 12 goals last season, for an 18/19 year old, is very good. And it only got better once he turned into a starter in the second half of the season and he scored 8 or 9 of them in his last 14 games or so I think.

1260~~~
Why does every commentator and pundit keep going on about how cold and calculating he looks?

You'd think we had Ted Bundy up front for us.

1261~~~
Just watched Van Gaal's post-match conference and he said Martial's greatest strenght is showing his talent under pressure. Pretty much why he's received so much praise and deservedly so.

1262~~~
Nice to see his thread is positive, as many were very unsure of his qualities as theyd never seen him play & gave a shite what United paid for him. 
Lad is class & is going to have ups & downs. Needs to be used correctly, so won't be starting every game.

1263~~~
It's his eyes. They give away no emotion - like a shark.

1264~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1265~~~
Just saw the stat on MOTD. I was wrong.

4 shots not 5. 3 goals <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
Clinical.

1266~~~
He just seems a bit unemotional, which is not a bad trait in a striker.

I read an interesting article which talked about the very top players and how many of them would probably score quite highly on tests of psychopathic personality.

That's not to say they're killers or anything, it just means they remain emotionally detached from the situation around them and nothing phases them. They don't do nerves or fear.

Not many people would have the ability to zone out from the occasion of a football match played in front of thousands of screaming fans and millions watching worldwide.

1267~~~
Another decent performance, although that second goal in particular was handed to him by Southampton. Nonetheless you have to finish it and he did it well, as was the case with the first one. I'm still not gonna expect any wonders from him this season. While he could continue to be very productive for us, I'm also not gonna be concerned if he hits a dry spell. He's still 19 years old after all.

1268~~~
Good to see him on the scoresheet.  And great to see us get 3 goals in a game.. have we turned the corner?

1269~~~
Despite his price, I think it'd be harsh of us to have major expectations for him this season. I'm happy with whatever he can contribute.

1270~~~
So far it's pretty much ok to say that he'll be better in the box than Welbeck will ever be.

1271~~~
Well... yeah. Given that that's the weakest area of Welbeck's game*, that's hardly a high bar.

*unless the pass is hit behind him, in which case he'll flick the ball between his legs to score every damn time. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Anyway, cracking start to the lad's United career. Keep it going!

1272~~~
I know I've harped on about the kid a lot from the day we went in for him, but I'd be amazed if he wasn't one of the world's best players (never mind strikers) in 3-5 years time at least. He has the attributes of a top, top player but I think the main thing that could be seen in his Monaco days was that look of confidence in his own ability that the top players seem to have at that age (Ronaldo, Neymar etc.) even when they don't play brilliantly, or make some mistakes you can see that self assuredness in them. I can't help but think back to Van Gaal and Kluivert too, exciting times for us ahead because even if we're not firing on all cylinders as a team, we have an amazingly good and exciting foundation for the future with players like Martial, Memphis (who will come good), Shaw, Schneiderlin and the likes, and with a truly world class, inspirational player like Schweinsteiger to learn from too.

I haven't felt such a strong attachment to so many UTD players since the class of 92 days and I don't think I've been quite so in love with a player since Cantona as I am with Schweinsteiger <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1273~~~
He reminds me of Marlo from The Wire. Silent killer.

1274~~~
He's got that arrogance about him, he just knows he's good enough to play here. Was genuinely worried he'd struggle a bit after all the press attention and pressure put on him, but he doesn't look fazed in the slightest. It shows an extreme amount of confidence in his own ability.

1275~~~
I feel like Memphis and Martial can be our new Rooney and Ronaldo. They might not reach their level, but having two young players (plus Shaw and Januzaj) playing regularly and pushing each other on can only improve all of them.

1276~~~
we should sell him then, there is only place for one Marlo in the team!

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00814/Ashley_Young_and_Ja_814717a.jpg" src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00814/Ashley_Young_and_Ja_814717a.jpg"/>

1277~~~
So does Ashley Young.

Damn it. A few seconds too late <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1279~~~
He has that thing that you always, always, always want from a top striker...composure. He has a huge future ahead of him at our club.

1280~~~
Well done, just slotting in like it's nothing.

1281~~~
That touch at 6.26 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1282~~~
Am I the only one that can't help smiling watching him play?

He's just one of those players that is so enjoyable to watch. He brings a sense of excitement and magic to the game. Everytime he gets the ball you sit up, in anticipation of him doing something, and you can tell defenders are shit scared of him already too. The second he gets the ball they're backing off. We haven't really had a player like that since Nani's peak, and before then, Ronaldo. RVP is the closest, but he was exciting in a completely different way.

1283~~~
I'll honestly never grow tired of his goal against Liverpool. Just watched it again now and ended up having to replay it 15 times. I'm probably into triple digits at this point. It's a perfect goal. The timing, the occasion, the execution... There's also something very special about the roar from the Stretford End when the ball finds the net. Rarely hear the crowd scream like that at foodball matches.

One of those United moments I'll never ever forget.

1284~~~
Read before he signed that he was raw and would take time to settle, but his game looks so accomplished it's very impressive. I can't see how it would be possible that he's not first choice #9 now. He was brilliant.

1285~~~

1286~~~
Congrats to this massive signing. Looks like he could be a real world beater. Kinda reminds me of the young Rooney.

France really has some talents coming up. Coman at Bayern looked very promising so far as well.

1287~~~
quickly becoming a favorite of mine. He and Memphis are going to be special.  I like Mata but if we can get some speed on the other side our front line can be quite good.

1288~~~
They've got a truckload coming through. Here's hoping they don't just fizzle out at the next major national tournament.

1289~~~
France are going to have a hard time giving their strikers enough games with Lacazette, Martial, Benzema, Griezmann, Coman and Fekir all wanting in. I guess Fekir could play deeper and Griezmann and Coman could play wide. Crazy amount of attacking talent, though.

Add Pogba, Varane, Laporte, Kondogbia, Kurzawa and Zouma to the mix and the future of French football is looking very bright.

1290~~~
Linked play well, scored twice and drew 2 yellow cards with his running. Excellent stuff.

1291~~~
Found this on Reddit: Van Persie & Martial

1292~~~
Haven'tseen the full game yet but had a look at the goals, so can't comment on his overall game, but feck me this kid is ice cold in front of goal. His finished already looks top class.

1293~~~
Great post.

1294~~~
Blown away by how good he is. The fact I had no real idea who he was before we signed him has made watching him even more fun. Just absolutely ruthless in front of goal. Would probably rest him midweek and unleash him against Sunderland.

1295~~~
Cool as ice! Just the Cf we need. Rooney ain't going to get a sniff at no.9 with him now. He really shows all the attributes of what we want from a striker. His hold up play is so composed, loved to run at defenders and is not afraid to take a shot when needed. Can't believe we have him as our CF. <img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

Up yours Daily Mail!!!

1296~~~
He has this look about him like someone that just want to get the job done, simple. I like that he doesn't speak English yet, else the press will be queuing up for interviews.

1297~~~
That is a good read!

1298~~~
Yep, fully agree. Watching him, you can't see a real weak point. He's tall enough and has a good leap on him and can hold his own in the air, winning 7 aerial duels today (though we haven't seen how good he is at heading it at goal yet), he's really fast, strong, has very good hold up and link up play, makes good runs in behind, works hard, very good at going past players, has a great touch, and is ridiculously composed in front of goal. And has played 2 pretty big games in his first 2 United games in the league and has been brilliant in both. He absolutely has it all. Just a matter of keeping it up and keeping his head down, because he has it all to become a world class player and one of the best players around.

1299~~~
He has that Bergkamp/Cantona aura about him because he always seems to be two steps ahead of the play, his decision making is fantastic and his composure to pull off his vision really makes him stand out.   He also has the really special ability to turn up the pace and burn past the defenders if need be. 

Technically he is great as well, his finishing and the way he opens up his body is fantastic. And of course he complements all his footballing brain and talent with his physical ability.

I think he is the most talented teenager I have seen play for Untied since Ronaldo.  I also think he will be our top scorer this season if he gets enough minutes. I hope he can stay with us for his peak years.

1300~~~
Read this comment on the Guardian match report.

1301~~~
His second half performance was almost flawless. He can do everything you need from a striker.

1302~~~
I was thinking more about his demeanor, but yeah, in terms of pure looks, Ashley is closer.

1303~~~
...

Sorry Dev, couldn't resist. I don't think anyone's in a position to be holier than thou. Well, anyone except the people in the club that were roundly criticised for thinking he was worth anywhere near that amount. Us fans were generally clueless.

1304~~~
I believe Neville can't get the concept that this Johnny Foreigner may well end up Rooney's career with us and take another spot from the English nationals. He certainly wouldn't be so doubtful if Harry Kane or Saido Berahino were at United and doing so well

1305~~~
Its true there was nothing that excites me with this deal cause I knew nothing about him. That's why I asked kouroux and JPRouve about what they think about the player. They follow the French League as much as I follow the Serie A so they know their stuff


Please note that I am not paid quite handsomely to  go on life TV dressed like a secret agent from Man in Black and act like a football 'expert'. Football is a hobby for me not a profession. Hence you cant blame me for not knowing anything about the French Ligue (something I've been honest about from day 1). If I am paid to do such job I would certainly make sure to follow football more (at least the main leagues ie La Liga, the German, Italian and French league) and ask people who watch French football regularly what they think before sprouting such crap on life TV.

1306~~~
The only thing I can think of is that Martial is very important to how we play. If he got injured, we'd only have Wilson potentially similar IF he's ready to play his natural game but he's no where near as strong yet. When we had Rooney and Ronaldo, we had more options and the team was in much better shape

1307~~~
The problem isn't Wilson but Rooney. Rooney should be playing as a world class striker whose being paid god knows how much while Martial and Wilson should be fighting for a backup role. Till the time of writing Rooney had failed to deliver and Martial had stepped up. You cant blame Wilson for that

1308~~~
What <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> linked play well? His link up play was dreadful apart from the goals. He gave it away loads. Cool as a cucumber on the goals however, still a lot of developing to do but this is some dynamite game time that he's getting and he really does look like he has the goods. Pretty stoked for how it is going for him so far.

1309~~~
He makes an impression as if he's mentally on top of everything. Nothing seems to faze him, he stays cool and calm, no nerves or crazy emotions. The way he opened up his body against Liverpool and Southampten just shows that he's a very composed finisher as well. His build up play is already quite good.

1310~~~
How fast is he really?

I don't quite see the frightening pace of Henry but he seems as quick as say an Anelka in his prime.

1311~~~
One thing which has surprised me is his strength and willingness to challenge the defenders. He doesn't mind going up in the air back to goal and trying to get something on the ball, often winning the header. He has far more to his game than I initially thought he would.

When you watch Wilson (who I rate highly) he just jumps with no intention of winning the ball, just makes it look like he is doing something, Martial gets in there and challenges the CB which is great to see.

1312~~~
The attacking talents are numerous these days.

1313~~~
He's my favourite United player at the moment. With the pressure that's on him to perform well at such a young age he's thriving. Looks so calm and composed in front of goal. Can see this lad being our no.9 for many years to come.

1314~~~
Noticed that alright and laughed about it because someone was on here saying he was getting dominated in the air by defenders, which is not true at all. He seemed to win and flick on everyone of them, it's just a pity no one was making a press for the second ball.

1315~~~
Calm down. He did fine. Not brilliant but good enough, never in a million years was he dreadful yesterday.

1316~~~
No he was never in a million years dreadful, but I didn't say he was dreadful, his link up play though, was very ordinary. I think he only had about 57% passing accuracy which is abhorrent, those numbers are in another world compared to Rooney at 9 in some of his 'worst' performances this season. The lad is young and he bagged two goals, so slate wiped clean and on we go!

1317~~~
A lot of his passes didn't come off yesterday, especially in the first half, but the intent was clear. He was trying to make things happen all the time. If he can polish that side of his game and build a bit of chemistry with the rest of the team he has the potential to become a genuinely world class complete forward. His footballing brain seems very good.

In the second half he had a couple of very good combinations to open up space so he could run at the defenders. Think both of them ended with the centre back getting booked.

1318~~~
Yep. They couldn't deal with him at all when he tried to skip past them. It's such a relief to have an attacker that can go past players again.

1319~~~
Ahh, so it's ordinary. That's better than dreadful in my book. I don't like how everything is taken to extremes these days, either brilliant or terrible, nothing can be just fine or okay. It's the clickbait nature of the internet I suppose.
I thought he did fairly well in terms of passing. Obviously being the lone striker means he will often have lower passing accuracies than the rest of the team. Do you know if headers were counted in that stat? From his highlights I'd have thought he had more than 57%.

1320~~~
Agree, he was not a patch on Rooney who has been terrific in link up this season.

1321~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1322~~~
Another good game from the cold fish. I wasn't expecting much from him this season but in the space of 10 days he has become nearly a vital member of the team.

1323~~~
You need to put that number in perspective out of 13 unsuccessful passes 7 are headers, yesterday Rooney refused to play close to Martial when the latter was in an aerial dual.

1324~~~
No, please stop, Rooney has been great and people have agenda while Martial has been downright dreadful. Link up.

1325~~~
Lone front men do tend to have poor pass completion rates. Remember seeing Drogba's stats and being surprised at how low it was. Do they really count headers then? That seems a bit silly really.

1326~~~
LvG specifically praised his holdup ability. Its not outlandish to suggest he linked play well.

1327~~~
He did well, but some of his passes are too soft or played with too much nonchalance.

1328~~~
Of course they count headers. Passing completion is such a pointless statistic for a forward but in days of post-Moneyball and the gazillion of Opta stats it's inevitable that people would rather use Excel than their eyes to assess footballer hence nonsense like 'Rooney's link up has been good' because numbers specifically show that he's had 84.4214215125124% pass completion which is 2.52132151243125% over the average and 1.25135315523% better than Messi and converts to 0.41241251265124% better chance of winning the game and 0.021515124345% better chance to win trophy. In total Rooney's productivity has been estimated at $4.412412512million.

1329~~~
This is correct, but that will come. Think he held the ball up very well, and attempted to turn and keep the ball going forward too.
Didn't always execute the pass correctly, but the signs are very promising.

1330~~~
I thought his hold up play was very good. A wee bit sloppy with his passing and touch in the first half but got better and better as the game went on. His passing stats will be messed up by all the headers he won cleanly, he generally found his team-mate with the ball on the ground though.

1331~~~
Yeah I'd rather go with your unbiased and perfect opinion Joe Bloggs.

1332~~~
Would probably be better if you watched football and form yours. Works better than putting numbers in Excel and using formulas to judge players performance.

1333~~~
I love that he has a knack for getting past players with a simple touch or two. I read multiple accounts of people saying how Martial makes things look easy and I definately see what they mean.

1334~~~
As with all things the answer is to do both. Evaluate for yourself first and foremost and then stack it up against the statistics and see how it holds. The mind can be tricked very easily so it's always good to question yourself and stats are a great resource for that. I've generally been impressed with Martial's hold up play and ability to bring others into the game, he does have to work on weighting his passes a bit but overall still very promising in that regard.

1335~~~
I noticed this when I was watching and was going to post it here! But yeah, I agree with everything you said.

1336~~~
He has the composure of a seasoned, veteran striker. And his hold-up play as well as his one-touch passing is brilliant - not to mention his ice cold composure in front of goal. His pace and dribbling also adds a lot to our attack and the speed in which we transition moving up the field - i.e. he links up very well with Depay. 

The kid looks like the real deal.

1337~~~
Annoying that we didn't get this done sooner. I think those golden chances Rooney had against Swansea would've been slotted away by Martial.

1338~~~
De Gea in net and Martial up front all season and we could be top of the league! Maybe.

1339~~~
An extra point against Swansea is pretty much a given seeing as De Gea would have likely conceded neither of these goals and I reckon Martial would have been able to put one past Newcastle.

1340~~~
It's all going too good to be true really. There will surely be a run of games where he barely even gets a shot on target. But as so many have said, we need to be patient when that time comes.

1341~~~
In 50 minutes at St Mary's, <b>Anthony Martial</b> scored more away league goals than <b>Wayne Rooney </b>has managed since March 2014. He's played 1,753 fewer minutes.

1342~~~
Has Wenger done his nearly signed him speech yet?

1343~~~
I worry about this too but I guess we only live for the moment so it doesn't really help to overthink stuff. What we need is the rest of our attack stepping up because surely a time will come when he can't conjure up these moments of brilliance.

1344~~~
Yeah for sure. There will very likely come a time where he won't contribute much and will drift in and out of games. But that happens with all strikers, especially ones who are teenagers.

1345~~~
I can't wait to see him in a relatively easier game at home against Sunderland, where we will attack more. All the game's he's played so far have been physical and tough. 

I can't believe how easily he's slotted in, and how much of a difference a relatively unknown 19 year old has made is such a short period of time.

1346~~~

1347~~~
Heh, this "winger type" bloke already has more goals this season than any of his strikers

1348~~~
I keep reading that Martial is destined to go on a long spell of poor form, just because he's 19. I personally don't buy it. Sure, he's not going to score every game, but his strength, movement and speed isn't suddenly going to disappear. I think he has all of the attributes to remain a consistent threat to Premier League defenders.

1349~~~
I checked the odds on him being YPOTY last night, and he wasn't listed with any bookie. Now he's one of the favourites;

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.oddschecker.com/football/english/premier-league/pfa-young-player-of-the-year" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.oddschecker.com/football/english/premier-league/pfa-young-player-of-the-year</a>

1350~~~
That seems well worth a few quid at 9/1 for any betting men. Don't let EssexRob see it, he'll curse him.

1351~~~
Threw £20 on it. Damn you. 

Actually think it's a decent enough punt compared to other long shot bets.

1352~~~
Right on cue. Wenger has said he had been keeping tabs on Martial since he was a kid but they didn't sign him because they have wingers like Walcott and Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sanchez and Campbell.

1353~~~
I thought he did it well for a young player starting his first PL game. Sure there were some mistakes, either under hit passes or holding on to long, but in the context of his age and getting used to the league there were a lot more positives in that aspect of his game than negatives for me.

1354~~~
He's probably crying into his evian that he didn't snap him up. I keep thinking back to what Paul Merson said on Soccer Saturday "Arsene Wenger knows the French market better than anyone he doesn't think this kid is worth the money" and it brings a smile to my face.

1355~~~
Despite his most recent French signings being Giroud, Sanogo and Debuchy and the recent ones from Ligue 1 being Sanogo and Ospina. Going a further few years back there's been the hit successes Gervinho and Chamakh. But yeh he knows the French market better than anyone..

1356~~~
There's also Sanson, Lecomte, Imbula, Digne, Amavi, Mendy, Umtiti, Ntep and Tolisso to consider. Ridiculous really. Whether they actually win something is a different matter, but they should with that amount of talent in the future. 

Weird, if he really believes that. He always looked more like a striker IMO and his performances suffered out wide.

1357~~~
Its kinda crazy that the clean sheets have dried up since DDG's return, or proper since Swansea.

1358~~~
While I agree with the sentiment, it was actually, to be fair to the Mail, the Mirror that called him a waste of money.

I'd still go with Luke Shaw, but Martial has done as well as he could have in the time he has been here. 

The defence probably play at a worse level, knowing De Gea will save their arses 9 times out of 10.

1359~~~
I would think most top clubs have an extensive enough scouting network to keep tabs on most stand out youngsters or even youngsters with half decent potential. Wenger just seem to like stating it more than others.

1360~~~
He's done so well, he's exceeded any sort of reasonable hope I had. I just hope when things will naturally more difficult, he won't criticized too much (like it is the case with Memphis on the caf).

1361~~~
Wenger believes he was more of a winger than a striker because he likes to drift out wide. Pretty sure that's what Henry did every single time he scored so I'm not sure why he seems to think he would have only been suited to playing the wing role. With their current lack of goals I'd be extremely quiet if I were Wenger and someone else's striker was scoring and looking good.

1362~~~
And Rabiot and Areola. Decided I hat to draw a line at some point or I'd feel like I was writing a book.

Cheeky bet on France being one of the finalists in 2018 or 2022? Wouldn't surprise me at all. Ever since they got rid of Domenech they've actually looked like a solid team unit as well. Belgium and France have been doing some extremely sound work with their youngsters in the last 15-20 years or so. Germany too.

1363~~~
Wouldn't surprise me either. They actually should win something with that talent, everything else would probably be disappointing for them. Deschamps needs to stop playing players like Tremoulinas, Valbuena and Sissoko. They simply have better players than that.

1364~~~
You really hate the numbers higher then 5, you only used 8 once and 6 once other than that all the numbers are 5 or lower and because of this i don't believe you stats, they might be fake.

1365~~~
He played against them in the last year CL matches with Monaco. He played on wing and i bet that Wenger got an idea that he is winger from that experience, he just want to look knowledgeable.

1366~~~
It is in perspective, he is a young and talented player who scored twice. So we move on and hope he improves. Like I said, goals outweigh the negatives. We are all fine with that, it has been like that for Rooney in the past.

1367~~~
He can always improve, but even if he keeps playing like this it should be enough to be considered one of the best strikers in the league and easily our best striker, well ahead of Rooney.

1368~~~
Additionally, passing percentage requires you to be able to control the ball with your first touch and then attempt to play a pass. If your first touch lets you down 40% of the time, you can't trap the ball and allow a defender to nick it, it's not going to show up in the passing percentage column.

1369~~~
Whoever scouted him and convinced the management team that he was worth paying over the odds for, needs a big pat on the back. In a weird sort of way, I love buying a nobody because you have such little expectation.

1370~~~

1371~~~
I never realised it until that video, but it's fascinating to see that he was getting jeered a few times for little mistakes by the Southampton fans, yet he still managed to keep calm and collected. How can a teenager be so fecking unaffected by crowd pressure?! This guy is brilliant.

1372~~~
Watch the video in this thread. He really did have a fair few decent hold up plays.

1373~~~
For £56 million there are plenty of expectations.

1374~~~
I'm 23 and have grown a few inches from 21-23, so he has some time left indeed.

1375~~~
Hold up play is different to link up play. His hold up play is actually very good, but his link up play was not in that Soton game.
Yeah, your Ole's and Vidic's and Chichas for 250k/7m respectively.

We shelled out some serious coin on this kid, it honestly sounds more like pulling the trigger to obtain him than unearthing an unknown gem.

1376~~~
Men can still grow until 25 right? It'll be good for Martial if he can reach 6ft or 6'1 in the next few years.

1377~~~
What Neville said was that ideally you want to introduce a 19yrs old player slowly and not start him every game. But seeing we currently have only 1 or 2 strikers, and also the fact that Martial is our only striker who can offer pace upfront, its a necessity that he starts 95% of our games, which is true.

1378~~~
I was watching highlights of De Gea agains Southampton and in the second half Martial won 4-5 headers after goalkicks when there was abolutely nobody from oute team in 20 meter radius. Stats can be misleading.

1379~~~
I disagree with that premise. Ronaldo played 50 games when he was 19 and played 40 games the season before when he was still 18. He's our best striker and should start every week if he's fit; resting him for League Cup, CL dead rubbers and lower level FA Cup games when required.

1380~~~
Wingers are a bit different, they play more of a 'give em hell' position and one of less pressure. Ronaldo wasn't our best striker/winger back then either.

1381~~~
To be honest Ronaldo almost instantly became our best right winger and certainly by the time he was Martial's age he was beginning to eclipse Giggs as our best winger full stop. There's no reason why Martial can't play every week; even if we end up moving Rooney up front, Mata behind and Martial to the right for a few games here and there if we feel the pressure is getting to him.

1382~~~
Yeah true.

1383~~~
Ronaldo was not eclipsing Giggs when he was 19, that was end of his first season/start of his second season. He was still very inconsistent then and his goal/assist output was nothing like it would be by 2006.

1384~~~
He need support. I would still move for Berahino in January.

1385~~~
Looks like there is not much appreciation for numbers in this forum!

1386~~~
By the end of Ronaldo's second season he was starting to (in my opinion) and bear in mind Martial is a year further in his development age wise there's no reason that by the end of the season we can't be looking at him in a similar vein. 

The main point though is that Martial should be fine with playing 40 games this season. We just need to keep a close eye to make sure that firstly he isn't letting the pressure of being our main striker get to him (he doesn't seem the sort but who knows) and secondly that he isn't starting to get mentally tired (which links in to the aforementioned pressure of playing for a club like United). I remember Fergie sending Ronaldo home to Portugal for a week when he was a similar age and he came back completely re-vitalised, which is always an option.

1387~~~
The "what a waste of money" chants after his second. <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/> class away lads.

1388~~~
Don't want him anywhere near our club, and thankfully I don't think the management do either.

1389~~~
There really isn't though. Unless you don't actually follow football and just look at the price tag then sure, but most will know the fee is irrelevant these days, which is why most are "undisclosed". We needed a striker and pretty much gave them a blank chequebook, but so far it's looked good money spent.

1390~~~
gotta love when people use the Euro amount to make the fee seem bigger....

1391~~~
He didn't<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> Although he included all bonus payments, which he should as a true United fan because we should all hope he meets all the criteria stipulating the full payment, including becoming the best player in the world!

1392~~~
I think Southampton fans were chanting that when Martial missed a chance early in the game, just makes it better when United fans chanted it back after he got 2 goals <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1393~~~
I hink he starts for the sake of getting into it and gaining even more confidence against "poor" Ipswich side

1394~~~
Yes, expectations like winning the CL and the Balon d'Or, both of which are required before that fee becomes a reality.

1395~~~
4 goals 4 games <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1396~~~
What a waste of money

1397~~~
Made him Triple Captain for the game against Sunderland (H).

1398~~~
lacks a bit of composure eh?

1399~~~
Love this man.

1400~~~
Absolute finisher. That's 5 shots, 4 goals now.

Edit: Wait no, he missed one today! 6 shots, 4 goals.

1401~~~
Clinical finish, he just can't stop scoring can he <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1402~~~
He's a sensation. I honestly can't see him not scoring in a game. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1403~~~
United are going to have to pay that big bonus payment before Xmas at this rate <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>
And we are so concerned about United paying too much for players.

1404~~~
Martial going HAM

1405~~~
Needs a loan spell at Sunderland to truly see his potential, I feel.

1406~~~
He's an absolute machine. Complete nightmare for defenders

1407~~~
Who can stop him?

1408~~~
FFS

1409~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/eP9hY31nJuB/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

1410~~~
He has basically become our main striker in the matter of 120 mins of football. Incredible

1411~~~
He looks so composed in front of goal. Like he just doesn't give a feck.

1412~~~
Brilliant <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1413~~~
yeah, there's no need to worry. even into my late twenties i can grow a few inches almost at will.

1414~~~
Lethal. I love him already.

1415~~~
Its like he copies and pastes every goal <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1416~~~
Plays. Scores. 

Love him already.

1417~~~
We may have to actually pay that Balon d'or clause.

1418~~~
Well deserved kid. Like I said when we signed him up, I hope he performs well and shuts a lot of doubters up.

1419~~~
Equals Falcao's tally.

1420~~~
Incredible.  Simply incredible.  How good is this kid going to become????

<b>Massive credit to Van Gaal and Woodward</b> for having the balls to spend all that cash on a player no-one had heard of but on current evidence looks like hewn become a world star!

1421~~~
4 goals in 100 minutes? Impressive!

1422~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1423~~~
Already as many goals as Falcao had last season

1424~~~
Almost seems quite complete a striker already.

1425~~~
That's becoming a bit of a trademark finish of his.

1426~~~
Bargain if we do.

1427~~~
We will pay that 25 goals clause very soon at this rate.

1428~~~
This guy. I mean, he makes everything look so easily. Effortless!

1429~~~
You just know when he's in that position, he's going to stick it in the corner, but there's nothing you can do about it.

1430~~~
It just gets better and better. 

If he keeps this up he'll be eyeing Van Nistlerooy's record of goals in consecutive league games. 

What a waste of money, eh?! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1431~~~
This kid <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1432~~~
Here's hoping we have to pay every penny of all those add ons.

1433~~~
And if FM is right, he will stop scoring after that.

1434~~~
He's possibly the most composed finisher I've ever seen.

1435~~~
He's absolutely lethal. Cuts across defenders once he's ahead of them and remains ice cold as he puts it in the back of the net.

1436~~~
I was about to type 'sell him he hasn't scored' when he scored <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1437~~~
Anyone seen GlastonSpur lately? Thinking back to this classic:

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/anthony-martial.408616/page-4#post-18050289">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/anthony-martial.408616/page-4#post-18050289</a>

As it stands . . .

<b>Martial:</b>
Games: 4
Goals: 4

<b>Kane: </b>
Games: 7
Goals: 0.

1438~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1439~~~
And more than Falcao will get this season.

1440~~~
Teams are going to start sticking a defender permanently on the left post whenever he plays <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1441~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1442~~~
You tell him to score and he scores, absolute madman.

Seriously though, he's so fecking laid back, you got to love his swagger.

1443~~~
What a man.

1444~~~
<a class="username" data-user="24632, @GlastonSpur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/24632/">@GlastonSpur</a>

1445~~~
If this keeps up, everything bar the 2nd and 3 seasons of golden boot will be done and dusted this season. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1446~~~
115 minutes in the league
90 minutes in the CL
20 minutes in the League Cup

4 goals in 225 minutes. Insane <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1447~~~
He's fast becoming my favourite little player.

1448~~~
Don't remember a player who was so clinical at this young age. Messi doesn't count in these kind of things, obviously.

1449~~~
Every goal scored so far has been placed calmly in the corner.
He's unreal

1450~~~
he's all right foot though. That terrible shot well wide he took with his right, when with his left he would have had a much better angle.
<span style="color: #ffffff">go on, hit me</span>

1451~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>



Radamel <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1452~~~
He's basically what many of you were hoping Welbeck would step up and start doing. This kid has it.

1453~~~
He will just ignore this like the De Gea thread.

1454~~~
He's amazing! I got high hopes for him, but I don't dare utter them out loud.

And almost the best thing is that he's already married with two little children! They're not going to give a feck about football when he comes home tonight, what a great way to keep his feet on the ground. Fergie would have loved this lad!

1455~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1456~~~
Not half bad this lad.

1457~~~
<a class="username" data-user="24632, @GlastonSpur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/24632/">@GlastonSpur</a>

1458~~~
He's not even played 3 whole games for us yet and he's made all the bluster around his signing look ridiculous already, marvellous.

1459~~~
I love how quickly he get his body in front of defender so the defenders has no chance to tackle him and than he slots it home easily like it's a training game. Seems like I was a bit wrong on him, he's massive potential. #martialarts

1460~~~
His finishing is so composed that he's already an asset to the first team.

Scary thing is his link up play is good but could potentially get better.

1461~~~
Messi got 17 goals in the season he started as a 19 year old. 16 goals in the season he started as a 20 year old.

He's almost a 1/4 of the way there already.

1462~~~
He's the real fecking deal. His composure in front of net is incredible.

1463~~~
I was thinking the exact same. Fair fecks to them, because the risk for Louis with this signing was extreme. His job would be on the line if he'd fail and at the very least laughing stock for life.

1464~~~
Wow

1465~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1466~~~
Ohh you dutty boy! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1467~~~
He just made that goal look ridiculously easy.

1468~~~
Yeah I was thinking the same, he just makes it look foolishly easy.

1469~~~
You almost take it for granted how difficult it is to actually finish as cooly as that, as he makes it look like chid's play. Insane really.

1470~~~
Knew he'd score as soon as he came on. Don't think anyone else in our squad has that aura about him.

1471~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1472~~~
And he seems a confident dribbler but there is a fair bit of space for him to improve in that regard too, just need to see what the lad is like in the air and shooting off his left peg and we could have a complete package on our hands.

1473~~~
Real Madrid bound in three years.......

1474~~~
Next season, when Wenger squeezes that extra 37.5% he apparently gets out of every player.

1475~~~
Cool customer. He'll score 20 this season.

1476~~~
We should not really start overhyping Martial. Kane had as good a number consistently throughout last season. Let hope Martial can do better or emulate such success for us this season and continue that form towards other season.

1477~~~
Did you really have to post that?

1478~~~
He can't possibly keep this shit up.. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1479~~~
I'm struggling to remember any other teenager having such an immediate impact for us, Ronaldo wasn't even like this! Rooney had his debut hat-trick I suppose, that was special.

1480~~~
These are the moments you're mean to enjoy!!

1481~~~
To be fair Ronaldo was a winger. Take away the price tag and I think there's a lot less pressure on a young striker than a young winger at United. Just look at Memphis at the moment

1482~~~
He gets the job done.

1483~~~
Haven't been this excited about a player in a long while. 19 years of age, he can break our goal scoring records.

1484~~~
This.

1485~~~
I don't see why not. Defenders can't get near him. He's strong on the ball, skilful and his movement is top notch to boot. Unless he hits a disastrous patch, I can see this continuing.

1486~~~
Kaboul will be quaking in his boots.

1487~~~
The Iceman strikes again! Loved the way he collected the ball into his path and just made the slight adjustment to slot it past the keeper.

1488~~~
Playing with no fear! what a sight to watch him play.

I'm really hoping Memphis can get a few goals soon and play with confidence.

The pair are going to scare the shit out of teams once they are both firing.

1489~~~
The best part for me is that he is not just a scoring merchant, he is a full package. Physically strong, aerial ability, fast, dribbling skills, movement, passing, vision, hold up... call me a fan<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1490~~~
oh come on, don't be so realistic. That's not how we roll around here.

1491~~~
Martial is going to have peaks and troughs but United fans are right to be excited by his potential, he doesn't seem weighed down by his price tag or anything and his composure in front of goal is incredible.

1492~~~
Feck off<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1493~~~
In the next summer window we should make Antonine griezman our priority target, imagine the French link up between him and martial. Ohhhhhh <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1494~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1495~~~
A graceful player and a joy to watch. He makes the game look easy.

Does anyone know what his personality is like? It's tough to get a sense for that. With his early success, I hope we can help him stay balanced and focused.

1496~~~
That is what surprise me the most about him. Martial must have commendable mental strength to play the type of football he is currently playing without being burdened by United's atmosphere or expectation that his price tag brought. I think Sir Alex once said that the most important aspect in purchasing a player is his mental strength and that seems like one of Martial noteworthy attributes.

1497~~~
looking at the goal again, didn't he pretty much rob the ball from Memphis?  He'd probably doesn't care who he needs to run over to get those goals.

1498~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1499~~~
He already has a family, as far as I know. Seems very grounded.

1500~~~
just saying....

1501~~~
All his goals are calmly taken. Placed with intent and not rushed. He is a breath of fresh air, similar to Chico in how he plays off the oppositions defenders, but with his pace he tends to stay onside unlike Chico!

He gives us that different dynamic. Quickens the tempo up front as with him in the team, it is ball to feet and played in behind the opposition.

1502~~~
He was in a better position. And looked back to acknowledge Memphis when he scored too, first time he has probably smiled after scoring lol.

1503~~~
His finishing is like a 13 year old abusing the R1+O finesse shot on FIFA 12.

1504~~~
Good point. Class above Chico already though, and the Hernandez was good when he burst onto the scene.

1505~~~
Oh Anthony
A month ago you meant nothing to me
Now every time you score
I love you more and more

1506~~~
Ya I think Chico was too eager or at least seemed that way, like jump starting a 100m race, saw the ball and didn't read the situation. Martial seems so calm, knows where he is and where he should be positionally to capitalise on a pass or mistake.

1507~~~
Just grounding myself... I hope his stock just rises and rises and we're paying the Balon D'Or bonus in 2017, but somehow I don't see that happening <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

And let's face it, no matter how meteoric a player's rise is, the speedbump comes at some point. Unless your name is Ronaldo or Messi ;P

1508~~~
Hard to stay grounded when he's scoring goals like he don't give a feck

1509~~~
Funny little thing, all his 4 goals have been put in the bottom right hand corner.

1510~~~
The hype started in France long before there was ever any mention of him coming here.  It appears to be real.

1511~~~
Wouldn't surprise me if he pulls off one of those outside the foot finishes he attempted.

1512~~~
Difference being martial has way more talent and pace then Kane has. They aren't even close ability wise on the ball and potential wise.

1513~~~
Glaston would like this <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1514~~~
Its true though. Kane is pretty good and all, but its like comparing current Rooney with current aguero. Its not much of a comparison is it?

1515~~~
I'm glad Arsenal got Welbeck.

1516~~~
It really isn't. I want to see Martial a bit more before we make statements like this.

1517~~~
Anthony "the bargain" Martial.

1518~~~
This kid blows my mind. The things he's been doing since the transfer shouldn't be possible. I had hardly heard of him when the news of our mega bid came in, and not even a month later he's scoring goals ever 50-odd minutes.

Mental.

1519~~~
If you are Rooney you are looking at him and thinking, This guy is about to retire me.

1520~~~
How isn't it? I'm not talking about current ability, I'm saying talent on the ball. Martial is great on it, has a great touch, is very quick, has excellent hold up play and is scoring for fun currently. There's a reason united spent so much on him and didn't go for Kane. Kane had a good season last year but currently hasn't scored this season. They're both young players, but martial is way ahead of him ability wise.

1521~~~
More clinical than a bag of surgeons, gets the blood up just seeing him coming on. About time we had someone who could become a talisman putting games away.

1522~~~
You're a tool. 

Just saying...

1523~~~
I think he's better on the ball and he's got more potential but I don't think it's cut and dry. (Although if it winds Glaston up it is.)

1524~~~
Strong, fast, good dribbler, ice cold in front of goal, 19 years old. How is this possible? <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1525~~~
I can not take this sentence seriously, it can't just be me.

1526~~~
Glaston is just a parody of himself nowadays in fairness.

1527~~~
Kane did score a lot of goals last season though, and varied goals too. including headers and free kicks. I think Martial will prove to be a much bigger talent, but it's too soon to write Kane off yet IMO.

1528~~~
So really we should be a little underwhelmed if he doesn't hit a hatrick on Saturday

1529~~~
hatrick? If he doesn't beat Lewandowski's 5 goals in 9 minutes, he should be sold.

1530~~~
What a weird post. What does he have to do with Welbeck? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

I know it's just a dig at Welbeck, but it's really shit one.

1531~~~
Quite a few people who've been involved with him have mentioned that he's very mature for his age. That seems to be really translating on to the field, as he does not look anywhere near as inexperienced as he is. He's so composed it's amazing

1532~~~
I am getting another United shirt with that name on it..

1533~~~
It's only £56mil if he wins the Ballon fecking D'Or at some point plus golden ball etc.

As an accountant I am curious just how much of the extra costs the finance team think it is prudent to start accruing for!

1534~~~
I just cant believe it.  Was his mediocre goal scoring for monaco due to shite team mates?

1535~~~
Hopefully it will give Rooney a kick in the ass to improve.

1536~~~
He spent a lot of the time playing in wide areas. Also if you look at the goalscoring stats of all the best youngsters Messi/CR7/Rooney they weren't at all prolific at a young age.

1537~~~
He actually had a pretty decent scoring run last season from about early March until early May where he scored 8 goals in 9 league games, which happened once he got more play time and played more as a CF.

Also got 2 goals in 3 games in the Coupe de France, was on the bench when they got knocked out by PSG though.

1538~~~
If Louie didn't let him go to Arsenal, Wenger would be all over him now, dumfuk.

1539~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1540~~~
I don't think Rooney needs any kicks up his back-side. He knows what he is up against.
Last year, when he was played in midfield, he had a get-out-of-jail card and he didn't look too bad, when compared against Falcao (who was/is woeful).
This year however, he is playing as a forward and he knows that he needs to score goals.

EDIT: speaking of Falcao: he played today, Chelsea scored 4...Falcao 0.

1541~~~
I just hope he can keep this form up. I would not want to spend near £100 on my Martial no.9 third kit, just to regret it in the near future. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1542~~~
10 of his 12 goals came towards the second half of the season. Seems like we are benefiting from him continuing that trend. Just a matter of a young kid just breaking into the team and at the cusp of developing into the final product.

1543~~~
Some of that maybe, plus not always being played as a striker, plus despite media quoting him playing 70 games or something for Monaco I've also seen somewhere he only played 8 full games last season, i.e. he was often a bench player.

Apparently what attracted Monaco to him was that he scored 32 goals in 21 games for Lyon's U17s.

1544~~~
You don't score goals in Ligue 1, only good and very good players manage to score. Sometimes you have an anomaly that is brutally rectified the next season.

1545~~~
He has to score against Sunderland's pathetic defense, surely? I think I'll be a little disappointed every time he doesn't score in a game from now on.

1546~~~
You're worried about £100. Ed's having heart attacks about the kid winning 4 Balon D'Ors before the end of his contract...

1547~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/46kh" width="560"></iframe>

1548~~~
I never watched him but I read on here he scored nearly a goal a game in his last 10 games.

1549~~~
Didn't he mostly play on the wing?

1550~~~
It doesn't make sense, logically.

Cool as ice in front of goal, clinical finishing, pace, strength, positioning, movement, can take a man on and beat him, great technique - all at 19 years old. He's playing like he's the next big thing in football.  Then how come no one knew him before he came to us? How come his stats at Monaco don't reflect what we are seeing here? How come no other club was in for him, or no coaches/managers have come out saying they knew he was world-class? 

Don't kill me, but I am scared what we are seeing is a purple patch, and that he'll start loosening up. We don't know about his personality and his attitude, we don't about his training ethics or professionalism. Something has to be missing - it just doesn't add up otherwise. 

Hope I'm wrong, and hope he is the next Henry, but I'll be cautious with my optimism, and enjoy the present.

1551~~~
Plenty of people knew about him and plenty that did predicted he'd be this good for us. I wasn't one of those people, but it's silly to claim that 'nobody' knew who he was.

1552~~~
Also just read his first club, a 7th tier French side, was also the same club Henry & Evra started out.

1553~~~
very few people outside of France and certainly English football knew very little about him.

1554~~~
They are from the same neighborhood.

1555~~~
People in English football know nothing, you guys bought Obertan and Gouffran, FFS.

1556~~~
He was linked to many clubs this summer - Tottenham, Barca and Chelsea for example.

1557~~~
Well, what I meant was - why was he not hyped up like most of the young talents these days are? There are always a group of people behind every good player who believe that he's much better than he is - but when someone truly special comes along, everyone who encounters the wonderkid acknowledges it.
My doubt is - how come no one knew Martial as a 'wonderkid' before we signed him? Because he certainly is playing like one. Or is it an anomaly, his first few games? Maybe he's not a wonderkid?

1558~~~
I'm not sure why that's even a surprise though. You could say the same about dozens of foreign players that took the league by storm. It's just because we paid over the odds that it's being highlighted more.

1559~~~
As others have just said, he was a prolific goalscorer in the second half of his last season with Monaco. For them he played sporadically and often from a wide position, but he started to nail down some strong goalscoring form before his move to us. I don't think it's true that people didn't know about him really - a lot of people didn't, but a lot certainly did. Wenger just came out saying he has tracked him for years, but didn't sign him because he saw him as a winger and not a striker. He cost £36m to start with, and has Ballon d'Or clauses that could make him cost even more, so it's obvious that Monaco rated him very highly and so did we. 

I'm sure we are seeing a purple patch really. He can't go on forever scoring a goal in every game, because then he'd be the best player in the world. Doesn't mean that he's not an extremely good talent.

1560~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  Yep.  Guilty as charged!

1561~~~
I feel the same but its mostly because we've had nothing but bad luck since Fergie left so we're used of being let down. Taking the past 3 years into account it seems too good to be true. 

Having said that this boy is the ultimate killer in front of goals, he has everything.

1562~~~
Maybe he is really 29, who knows <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1563~~~
Scored on his League, UCL and League Cup debut for us. Just the FA cup for the full set. Would surely be the first player we've had to do that?

1564~~~
He didn't score in the UCL mate

1565~~~

<b>Top 30 in EPL had 368 goals between them. Average of 12.2</b>

It's not that big of a difference.

1566~~~
Yep that was Memphis

1567~~~
Oh yeah, for some reason I was thinking his 4 goals came in singles but obv got 2 on Sunday! Durr

1568~~~
Exactly, you see a lot of 19 years old players score a lot of goals in EPL?

1569~~~
The way Ronaldo and Messi are scoring now, I doubt a-goal-a-game would be enough. 
But yeah, you make sense. :P
Yeah, too many false dawns and all that. Would be nice to be not let down.

1570~~~
I'm not writing Kane off at all, he's agood young striker with plenty of space for improvement, I just don't see anywhere near as much natural talent in him as I see in martial. Its nothing to do with goals really, its the overall play where I don't think they're on the same level.

1571~~~
I thought you were referring to general goalscoring stats in Ligue 1. Hence looked up the above numbers. 
If you're talkinng about youngsters scoring goals for fun, that doesn't happen in many leagues, to be fair.

1572~~~
Id like him to slolwy improve on the right hand side.  His left hand side dribbling is already world class.

1573~~~
I say that because it seems that people correlate the level of the league with the facility to score in it, which isn't true.

1574~~~
Okay, I exaggerated by quoting the fee with all the clauses taken into account, but whichever way you look at it it's a huge fee. Of course there are expectations on him, no matter how hard you try to convince yourselves otherwise. The club will have expectations of him, he'll have expectations of himself and us fans have expectations. 

Fortunately he doesn't seem the slightest bit bothered by them.

1575~~~
Yes. But every time someone wants to complain about how big a fee it is, they fallaciously quote the £58million, so expect people to call bullshit on that. If you think £36m is big enough to support your point, then say £36m. If not, don't bother making the point.

1576~~~
If he carries on like this imagine what he's going to be like in a few years time <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

1577~~~
Amazing the impact he has made in such a short time. He plays, he scores.

1578~~~
No better team to carry on his form than against Sunderland.

1579~~~
Three very similar goals thus far, opening his body up and sticking it low to the keepers left. Thought tonight's goal though really smacked of a player oozing confidence. That strength and directness is something new for us and his receiving of the ball and first five yards look as good as anything out there. He's  got the power and acceleration to turn a half chance into a goal and that's a great weapon.

1580~~~
The Henry comparisons are so far scarily accurate. Although Henry wasn't doing it at the level Martial is at his age. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

1581~~~
I can't believe his finishing, he is so so cold.

1582~~~
The way he moved his body in front of the defender after the first two touches, basically guaranteeing a foul or a shot; fecking fantastic

1583~~~
Sort of reminds me of the initial impact Whiteside made. Same astonishingly adult-like physique for a teenager, and same almost nonchalant goalscoring.

1584~~~
He is going to be a next superstar of football!

1585~~~
<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1586~~~
Is it bad he's already become one of my favourite players? I suppose it was quite easy for him to fill that position as last season's favourite was De Gae. 

Ah I remember the days when consistently my favourite was Scholes...

1587~~~
I don't think Rooney, Hernandez, Falcao or Van Persie would have been able to do that to be honest. None of them have the right mix of acceleration, strength and composure to pull it off. It's not like he's just turning in goals from great service - apart from the gift he got against Southampton he's had to work hard to pull these goals off

1588~~~
Can't lie but, I was disappointed with losing Welbeck and thought that was the type of striker we needed often last season. One that has pace, strength and good dribbler. Martial seems to fit all all of that and one of the most important things is has going for him is that he is not bambi on ice in front of goal. As someone said each of the goals have all been in the same corner and 3 of them have been identically cool finishes - it's like him finishing off a move in training. Long may it continue.

1589~~~
The  next phase is teams will now pay attention to him. Looking forward to see how he handles that.

1590~~~
More importantly, how his team mates use the space he he creates and set pieces he wins.

1591~~~
I thought after he signed that 10 or so goals and one or two standout performances would make for a good season. Possibly need to re-evaluate.

This past transfer window of ours may be looked back on for many years to come, thinking about it...

1592~~~
Well, we've been using Memphis space very well. Memphis came with a lot of reputation and he quickly peaked their interest. Interesting how teams plan for both of them.

1593~~~
The only one i can really think of was Ronaldo, but he was a goal a game player almost his whole career. If Martial gets anywhere close to him ill be amazed.

1594~~~
ALL ABOARD THE ANTHONY MARTIAL HYPE TRAIN 

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://i.imgur.com/68ucn8m.jpg" src="https://i.imgur.com/68ucn8m.jpg"/>

1595~~~
Is Jones sticking it in the train's back end?

1596~~~
Missed the match, but not at all surprised to see him score

1597~~~
I hope we pay up the full sum <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

It's been so long that we've had a player that makes you think he's going to score the moment he's near the penalty box.

1598~~~
I thought he was left footed but all his goals have been scored from his right foot

1599~~~
Thats what I noticed too. Is he that right footed?

1600~~~
With all due respect this is bullshit.

He was basically the best young prospect player in Fifa 14. A two year old game had him as the biggest upside young player. Anyone who plays Fifa knows who he was, that's like the entire world ;p

1601~~~
Ouch <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> true, but still ouch.

1602~~~
As others have said, this isn't really true. He was a starter as a 19 year old in the knockout rounds of the champions league against Arsenal and Juventus, was a wonderkid on football manager which always helps

1603~~~
Yeah, because Wenger is famous for paying over £50m for 19 year olds.

1604~~~
Martial is closer with his fee to what Arsenal paid for Ozil but what's more important about Wenger is that he's mainly famous for persuading younger players to play for him and not for us plus Chelsea was also sniffing around but thankfully Louie present them with Falcao.

What's with this sensitivity about Welbeck, Amar ? He's an Arsenal player for crying out loud. He had literal years to prove himself in the first squad for us. Just move on and be happy we finally got the superior talent. MK Dons fans...

1605~~~
On a couple of his goals where running through on goal he cuts right across the defender forcing him to take him down or back off completely. Really clever football.

1606~~~
I just hope when Martial goes through a dodgy patch people remember he's only 19! Far to early to say he will score this and that but happy with his overall play so far!

1607~~~
At 19 Henry was voted young French footballer of the year and scored 10 for Monaco in 96/97. That was his third season as a senior player (began at 17) and he had 16 senior goals altogether at that point. Martial already has a career total of 15 senior goals and he also made his first senior appearance at 17 (for Lyon). Almost neck and neck! Henry got wasted for a season at Juventus and that hurt his goal returns.

1608~~~
Any song/chant for him yet?

1609~~~
Plus he wasn't really being used as an out and out striker, he was used more as a winger. 

Similar again to Martial.

1610~~~
At Southampton it sounded like the crowd was singing "oh Anthony Mar-tial" but it also sounded like there was another song as well "something something something MAR-TI-AALLLLLLLLL" came here to ask what it was.

1611~~~
His close control is unreal, even at pace it never leaves the end of his foot . his finishing has been exceptional but I'm most excited by this tbh Thierry Messi <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1612~~~
Heard them singing "What a waste of Money" in the Southampton game and the fans sang his name to the RVP tune after the 'pool game

1613~~~
Andy Mitten was quoted saying Martial has been impressive in training and that the players aren't surprised by the impact he has made so far. Looks like more to come from this lad

1614~~~
That attribute is what will make him successful. The first goal against pool, the commentator said, it was a bit of luck and the ball came off to him nicely. Looking at the replay, he used the left foot to set the ball nicely. It was so fast and unreal.

1615~~~
This. He's paired that exceptional close control with very nice dribbling. Somewhat Giggsy like, that.

Also, Ranieri was spot on about what he told in that article (in the Times?). Lad has that superb ability of 'coming alive' or 'switching on' in crucial attacking moments. That way he's always a step ahead of the defenders. Can't exactly teach these instincts I think. You either have it, or not.

1616~~~
Hopefully he can become as feared as Sergio Aguero in this league. We have lacked a player that opponents fear for a long time.

1617~~~
His emergence will help take some pressure off Memphis, who has the more difficult task in the team tbf. They seem to enjoy playing together as well.

1618~~~
I'm not sure about all this "protecting young players" stuff, if the idea is to rest them when they don't need rest so that they don't get disappointed they're not better. Or whatever the point is supposed to be. The "pressure".

Except a top 19yo like Martial has been under pressure for years, has been making headlines for years, has done hundreds of interviews, does he need to be protected the same way we tend to think young players need protecting?

Hell, now that he's at United he'll be spending half his days doing commercials and posing with Ramen Noodles, The games are probably a nice diversion from being a walking advertisement.

1619~~~
I do think all those journos and pundits who were shouting 'panic buy' and denigrating United's transfer policies should be eating their words a tad. It's early days, but there is no doubting his ability and talent.

1620~~~
Just love the way he cuts across defenders- it leaves them having to hack him down or just let him through to finish. Souness was going on about how he will start sniffing out chances as he improves, we have already witnessed this- last night's goal was no run of the mill goal, the ball was almost behind him- within 2 touches it was in the net, i don't want to get over excited about him, i don't want to expect to much, but you just have a feeling that whilst he is on the pitch that the slightest lapse in concentration by opposing defences will be be punished, just hope he does not pick up an injury any time soon - the difference in our attack is like chalk and cheese when he is in or out of the team. Love this guy.

1621~~~
Still hurt?

1622~~~
It wasn't mediocre. He just was a year younger and for the first half of the season was either coming from match for a few minutes, or not playing at all. In the second half of the season he played more and in the end finished with 12 goals. Also, Ligue 1 is a very defensive league. More difficult to score a lot of goals there than in any other top league.

For players of his age, one year makes a big difference.

1623~~~
The guy is a killer. Stone cold.

1624~~~
It's obviously unreasonable to expect him to continue scoring with anything like this kind of regularity but he still has a transformative effect on our attack just by providing that focal point in attack. Pace in behind, strength with his back to goal and that constant willingness to drive at the defence all in one package is something we've had perhaps just twice in the last two decades. His killer instinct on top of that just makes him a truly special player.

1625~~~
Herrera and Mata praised him this week for always making runs. He has elevated our attack and that alone is worth a lot. Him creating space for himself to get his shots away is just an added bonus.

1626~~~
Is it too soon to get carried away with the Martial hype? Ah, feck it, this kid's going to be a world beater! What a joy to watch. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1627~~~
This! It's fantastic that he's had the start that he has, and long may it continue.

That said, typically, we would be expecting a level of adaption to a new league etc etc so if he goes a few games without scoring, we need to remain patient!

1628~~~
Sensational start of his United career. The really good thing is that he can become much better than this because he's only 19 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1629~~~
I haven't seen a decent replay - which is annoying - but the way he dragged the ball from slightly behind him right into his stride was really impressive. So many little details in each game that make me think we might have signed a real star.

1630~~~
His footwork in close quarters and coolness in finishing is absolutely incredible. He likes that bottom right corner for sure.

1631~~~
Yeah he does those little things while dribbling (or indeed while shooting) so instinctively, when for other players it is a part of their decision process. Its so heartwarming to watch.

1632~~~
I have seen some excellent dribbling from him in isolated sections, like the step below Messi when it comes to close control. I think that he will score some amazing goals.

1633~~~
If he keeps this up it won't be long til teams start to dread coming to OT again. The fear factor we'll have if him & Memphis grow into world class stars will be great to see. The midfield should benefit hugely from the extra space Martial creates, as well.

1634~~~
Martial will outscore Kane this season but will still not be seen as a €140m player Kane apparently is.

1635~~~
It's really not that, I don't care much about Welbeck anymore, but mentioning Welbeck in this thread is really stupid when we stuck with van Persie and Falcao last year and it was far better idea to keep Welbeck than both of them. Plus his idea of Wenger buying Martial is unreal.

1636~~~
Indeed, shows great ability to drag the ball from behind him without breaking stride or kicking it too far ahead of him. That, as well as the strength to hold off the defender shows how good a player he is going to be.

1637~~~
As bad as RVP was, he scored 2.5 times as many goals as Welbeck did in the league last season. Even Falcao who was shit scored as many as Welbeck <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Which tells all you need to know about how great Welbeck was last season.

Woudn't be funny if Martial (19 years old, different league, no-preseason) scores this seasons as many goals as Welbeck did in his entire career here?

1638~~~
Not for this thread, but no it wasn't.

1639~~~
If he bags 30 goals, I think we'd all be ecstatic!

1640~~~
I would've been over the moon when we signed him if he managed double figures in his first season. Now I can't see him not being our top scorer.

1641~~~
I will somehow be disappointed if he doesnt score 20 goals minimum now. 

Unbelievable I know.

1642~~~
There was a good one outside the stadium after the Liverpool game. "Ooh, ah, Mar-she-al, I said oh ah Martial!"

1643~~~
It is very unlikely, but not impossible. Kane did that last season.

However, I think that it is safe to beat that he'll break Welbeck's record for his best season (12 goals) during this season. And he'll score on this and the next seaosn more than Welbeck did here on three full seasons (and 25 mathches from other seasons).

1644~~~
I like to remind myself of this every time he scores:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/MiIPeHp.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/MiIPeHp.png"/>

1645~~~
Got his first of many in-forms in FIFA 16 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1646~~~
With every game, it looks like Monaco got a really crap deal!

1647~~~
Van Persie was really shit for us last season even though he scored some goals, and Falcao was even worse. Welbeck was definitely better player for Arsenal last year than those two were for us. Sure if you are looking just through goals you can think otherwise, but neither of those two were great goalscorers last season either.

But without discussing whether selling Welbeck was good or bad idea in general, it was definitely better idea to keep him over both of those considering they were actually ruining our play, and were on massive wages which meant we simply had to get rid of them for any price this season. Again, I am not saying it because I like Welbeck, I am saying it because loaning Falcao was obviously one of the worst decisions in our recent years, same as on insisting on playing van Persie who was obviously past it and couldn't give a feck in last two seasons for us.

Why?

1648~~~
Oh, Anthony Martial!

1649~~~
I expected Rooney to be the one who scored 4 in first 4 since, if I am not mistaken, he scored hattrick on his debut.

1650~~~
That Mirror article...

<span style="color: #000000">Yes, by you you daft muppets.</span>

1651~~~
He looks more like the Brazilian Ronaldo to me in style of play and build. Same height, demeanor, style of dribbling and running. 

<obviously I am not saying... bla bla>.

1652~~~
Louis van Gaal wanted a striker that could score goals..We can both agree that Danny really doesnt..Falcao was poor, but if being better than Falcao is the standard, then that is a very low one. Thats why we got rid of all three, RVP, Falcao and Welbeck. None are good enough for what we want in a striker, especially goals.

The goals came from elsewhere last season, with Fellani and Smalling both matching Danny's goal tally, and someone like Herrera chipping in too.

1653~~~
He makes finishing look easy with those low balls in the far corner.

1654~~~
he's everything I wanted Welbeck to be (so far).

1655~~~
Not been to a game this year, have we got a song for this lad yet. Can never make out new chants listening to the tele.

1656~~~
Basically same type of finish for all 4 goals so far.

1657~~~
It wasn't a better idea to keep Welbeck over both RvP and Falcao until it became apparent that both would have dismal seasons. Go back to transfer deadline day 2014 and only the smallest of minorities would take Welbeck over Falcao. We were replacing a hit and miss striker with one of the game's best strikers.

1658~~~
And then some.

1659~~~
His latest one is probably the most similar to his debut goal vs Liverpool.

1660~~~
Crowd have been singing the same one as RvP.  Oh Anthony Martial...

1661~~~
Keepers will have noticed that. Am looking forward to him shaping to do the same finish, then taking it round the keeper instead.

1662~~~
He should be our penalty taker. He's the coolest man in football at the minute.

1663~~~
Although only a cameo appearance against Ipswich, once again Martial definitely impressed.  He has so many great attributes at such a young age.  There will be rough patches ahead, I'm sure, but he clearly has all the tools to be a top player.  You can certainly see why United agreed to pay such a fee for him.  If his development is handled properly, and the player himself remains fully committed to his career, then I'm confident that he'll prove to be an astute buy.  One of the best things about his goal yesterday (in addition to the composed finish, of course) is that he didn't simply defer to Memphis.  After Memphis chested the ball down, I think he could have latched onto it himself.  Martial, though, saw the opportunity and swooped it.  It wasn't a selfish play, it was a confident and aggressive one.  That's a true striker's mentality.  He doesn't seem intimidated at all by the size of the club or the players around him.  That bodes well for United!

1664~~~
Exactly, defenders will study him and teams will plan for him, and then we will see a dropoff. But the good news is that if defenders are concentrating on Martial, then that should help open things up for Rooney, Mata and Memphis.

1665~~~
How long before they're singing "HE SCORES WHEN HE WANTS" <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1666~~~
Do not want, sell him.

1667~~~
His link up play is terrible.

1668~~~
And he has a fat arse.

1669~~~
Boring barnet too.

Sell Martial buy Hery:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/24/1227542/087691-229b55d2-626c-11e5-96fd-e6179f05e4c3.jpg" src="http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/24/1227542/087691-229b55d2-626c-11e5-96fd-e6179f05e4c3.jpg"/>

1670~~~
Wow.. give the kid some credit. For the guy at his age with the price tag he's got over his head, i thought the pressure would get to him but he has been calm, collective and has been putting it back in the net. Yes, defenders will probably look into him more but you cant deny he's got talent, with hard work in training, no distraction and a manager pushing him to be better and will be putting them defenders back to school to keep studying on him. So write him off too soon

1671~~~
Saint Martial has touched more people at the club.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3247458/Manchester-United-provide-visa-service-fans-laying-fingerprint-session-Old-Trafford-ahead-CSKA-Moscow-outing.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...on-Old-Trafford-ahead-CSKA-Moscow-outing.html</a>

We've become so generous during his presence.

1672~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Poor Falcao.

1673~~~
Anthony Martial score goals but more importantly he give the club and us supporters optimism about the future.

The prospect of an injuried Rooney doesn't scare us any longer. What a turnaround. I get vibes from when a young Ronaldo came to us, you just know we had something special in front of us. 

There will be a rollercoaster of emotions and results but wow this is what life is about. My optimism is back.

1674~~~
Was coming here to write something similar. 

The most depressing thread is the predicted top 4 thread and most having us 3rd or 4th. 

Martial gives us that optimism now. We have no clue how he will do this season. He could win us the title. We just don't know. But what we have seen is similar to the class RVP brought us in his first season. It's so exciting.

1675~~~
Martial can be anything really. The signing has given us a chance this season, because we'd score one every two games or so without him. 

One thing is clear so far though,  his arrival has highlighted how inadequate our attack was. What has has been doing, is what we, and what any other top club, needs from their centre forward. Just from the last few games, we've seen something I don't think Rooney could have given us this year, and if we'd bet the entire house on his 20 goal promise, I'd fear for our chances of making the top 4. 

From the brief snapshot, Martial also appears to allow our other forward players to play better, as the whole attack is more dynamic.

Long may it continue.

1676~~~
I really like him as a player, but I'm finding it difficult to warm to him as an individual. All the stuff about him being 'cold' and 'unemotional' is well and good, but it's making it difficult for me to connect to him the way I have done with our other new signings. 

He still doesn't feel like a player playing for the club I love.

1677~~~
I am giving him credit. I'm saying that teams are going to have to plan how to deal with him.

Young players have to develop themselves as defenders start to prepare better for what they do.

Cristiano had to do it, Martial will have growing pains as well.

1678~~~
Spot on. However if it's Bale who stole Ronaldo's ball in similar fashion he won't be able to get away with that, even if he scored <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1679~~~
Can't find the post now, but a Monaco fan had written a detailed post on him. 

He didn't call him cold and unemotional, he called him a "shy and reserved, a really good kid and a family man".

1680~~~
Henry seemed arrogant and a massive twat when he was really cool in real life. There is always going to be a difference between how a player appears on screen and how he really is.

1681~~~
It's great to see a player who does all of his talking on the pitch. Humble, reserved and family man are not terms i'd associate with a modern footballer, let alone a 19 year old kid who has just become the most expensive teenager of all time.

1682~~~
His lack of emotion cracks me up. It's like he doesn't realise size of what he is doing, fee, club everything. 
Looking forward to seeing the variation in his game. First goal at Southampton aside, seen same finish and celebration every time.

1683~~~
Yeah he needs to work on his celebrations <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1684~~~
Only confirms the noises about him that he is down to earth. Refreshing to see he isn't one of the many cringeworthy footballers nowadays who are at home standing in front of mirrors 'working on their celebrations'.

1685~~~
Exactly, the best scorer in the PL had same boring celebration with his hand lifted through his entire career...

1686~~~
That Liverpool goal seems like such a long time ago now.

1687~~~
Not to Skrtel <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1688~~~

1689~~~
*hugs*

1690~~~
As long as he keeps scoring - I can connect with him.
I tend to disconnect with players who are not good enough to play for MUFC, for example Falcao - that guy was/is terrible.

1691~~~
<span style="font-size: 12px">"Martial, déjà le petit prince de MU".   Martial already the little prince of United.
</span>

1692~~~
My friend, defending and/or saving goals is not as simple as that.
Just because you think you know what a striker will do, does not mean you can stop the goal from occurring.
Many great strikers in the past have a signature type of goal - everybody knows what he is going to do - but nobody can stop it from happening.
Similarly, nobody knows what Falcao/Rooney will do, but neither can score a EPL goal.

I do expect a drop-off, but it won't be because defenders or goalies have worked him out.

1693~~~
So true!

1694~~~
Yea he's a right boring cnut, if we don't get a triple corkscrew after his next goal I'll drive him to Madrid myself!

1695~~~
Have all of his goals gone into the bottom of the right corner so far? Seems to like placing them there.

1696~~~
Word out of the club was that the whole of Europe was after him and club had to act fast. Wenger'so comments also suggest the same.

1697~~~
My words suggested the same.

1698~~~
Yeah, I think so. Hopefully he can finish elsewhere <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1699~~~
Yep he was so hotly pursued that his name wasn't mentioned anywhere the whole summer until the day we signed him. Sounds like a popular bandwagon to jump on.

1700~~~
Why would clubs want the world to know they're after him?

1701~~~
Spurs, Barcelona, Chelsea were all linked with him at various points

1702~~~
Seriously, just because <i>you</i> hadn't heard of him doesn't mean that he was an unknown.

1703~~~
Wenger is just upset he can't go into France and pcik up world class gems for peanuts anymore.

1704~~~
I really don't know why I took time for this but still:

And a comments from one article after we bought him:
And comment from Barca sport director from the same article which indicates they were looking at him:

1705~~~
Wenger today said Monaco told him he would not be sold this summer and took them at their word. Dipoesnt know the powers of Ed.

1706~~~
They said that to everyone, United tried their luck after the CL elimination which was the thing to do.

1707~~~
Tbf there were rumors that many clubs were not happy when they sold him because they told everyone that he is not for sale. Also there were rumors of many people at Monaco being pissed because of his sale.

In the end it looks like it was just about offering amount of money they couldn't turn down. The future will show if it was a good decision but so far it looks like we did great.

1708~~~
There is always one poster talking absolute shite, no matter the topic. 

It is pretty simple in this case. A lot of clubs wanted him and had him on the radar, for years. We acted fast after their CL qualification wasnt successfull, offered them a big amount of money. They couldnt say no, we got him. Case closed. Well done Ed and LvG.

1709~~~
Ouch. <a class="username" data-user="17739, @December_16" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/17739/">@December_16</a> getting torn apart by the ass cheecks in this thread left and right....

1710~~~
I'm curbing my enthusiasm. This all seems too good to be true.

1711~~~
It's the usual Caf bollocks. He's shown great enthusiasm and emotion after each and every goal he's scored. How a finish is termed "cold" or "hot?" is beyond me. Maybe the word they are looking for is unfazed which would be a fantastic trait to have in a striker. Why would any of that perturb you?

1712~~~
My friend, scoring goals is not as simple as that. Managers work on tactical plans for individual players for a reason.

The kneejerk fan will talk about it as if the player suddenly lost their skill or pace when the truth is more complex.

For example, take Valencia's first season where he was devastating from the right with his crossing. Many fans would say he forgot how to cross or stopped taking on his man with his pace. I think that after a season a scouting report for how to show him onto his left foot was developed with the consequence that Valencia's one dimensionality was exposed.

This is one reason why SAF and now LVG like to blood players at different positions so they learn to do different things on the pitch.

Martial will command attention and that is a good thing because it will stretch defenses in a way they wouldn't against a less effective player.

1713~~~
Took them 3 seasons to figure him out? 6 if you start to count from his Wigan days.

1714~~~
As others have said... Many teams were thinking of going for him, but Monaco were saying no chance until they got knocked out of the champions league, but it was a huge price then. Everyone was planning on going for him next summer. And he wasn't unknown at all. Look at the champions league qualifiers thread and you'll see like 5-6 people (including me) calling for United to sign him. The talent is obvious with him.

1715~~~
I agree with you somewhat but I don't think it was that simple in the case of Valencia. He used to just be able to accelerate suddenly and get half a yard to make a cross. When defenders started overcompensating and trying to get the jump on him, he started feinting, they'd go, leaving him space to make a low cross. I remember him destroying Ashley Cole in particular with that trick. Nowadays he just seems bereft of both pace and confidence.

It remains to be seen whether Martial will get found out like Hernandez but I think he has a lot more in his locker so we don't have to worry as much.

1716~~~
I predict he will score 32 this season.

1717~~~
My memory is fuzzy. I should have said first full season, 2011-12. Valencia suffered that nasty injury which set him back.

At Wigan his production was less because the team played more negatively (as I recollect).

1718~~~
You do realize that that he was named player of the year after his injury right?

Defenders never figured out how to deal with Valencia. He just inexplicably turned to shite overnight.

1719~~~
Yeah, he won it in his first full season 2011-12. I'm saying he only really had one season where he was effective like that. I think defenders adjusted how they played him after that season.

1720~~~
Would fecking love him to score again today. Couldn't be a better fixture on paper (Liverpool maybe)

1721~~~
It's like scoring a touch down in american football. "Act like you've been here (endzone) before".

Basically don't lose your head, cause you should be expecting to be a frequent visitor.

1722~~~
Today will be a big test for him against a defence that will sit deep and not allow him space to run in behind. Interesting to see how good he is in the air.

1723~~~
Good start, looked lively.

1724~~~
He's so good on the ball! What a boy.

1725~~~
Love him.

1726~~~
Totally convinced, he's so good on the ball and quick.

1727~~~
Yeah he looks brilliant on the ball, very strong and the defenders are having a tough time getting it off him. Also looks good when playing wide, looks like he wants to take his man on and can more often than not beat him.

1728~~~
He isn't even having a great game yet he is causing them problems all the time. I really like him.

1729~~~
Decent first half from Martial. I'd like us to get the ball to him a bit quicker, but it's clear that he frightens the life out opposition defenders with his pace. His hold up play looks pretty good too.

1730~~~
Some nice control and turning his man, decent half from him and his hold up play is impressive.

1731~~~
He causes problems for Sunderlands defence, and it seems like he's roaming around everywhere. He's been putting in crosses from both flanks.

1732~~~
Hold up play is on another level. Foul generator.

1733~~~
A bit worried he might be too one footed. Seems to always turn onto his right. If he could be comfortably turning either direction he would be absolutely frightening.

1734~~~
He's doing well but you can see the defense is starting to respect him a lot more. Him and Memphis are not getting much space to run at Sunderland. His hold-up play is pretty good.

1735~~~
Definitely looks our most dangerous player. He is willing to turn and take players on rather than the safe back pass.

1736~~~
You could see his disappointment at Rooney not being up to the mark with his play

1737~~~
Someone needs to help him. He's trying his hardest to hold the ball up and run and create space and no one is linking with him.

Looks a class above.

1738~~~
Very Strong,Very Good hold play,hope he keeps improving

1739~~~
Looks so dangerous whether he is up front or drifting out wide. What a difference a top class striker like him makes. He's probably our most important player in that front 4 in terms of us looking threatening, because he offers things nobody else in our attack does.

1740~~~
Very Strong,Very Good hold play,hope he keeps improving

1741~~~
Very Strong,Very Good hold play,hope he keeps improving

1742~~~
He is a ridiculous person.

1743~~~
Amazing.

1744~~~
Contract extension time?

I seriously cannot believe the quality I am seeing.

1745~~~
Did he just score by playing kerbie off Rooney's knee...?

1746~~~
He's going to smash the Henry comparison at this rate.

1747~~~
He's a special player.

1748~~~
Who would have thought that a guy that i literally didn't know existed 2 months ago would so quickly become one of my favourite players

1749~~~
What in the actual feck just happened. Was he like this at Monaco?

1750~~~
This boy is the real deal. We've been missing this type of striker for years.

1751~~~
He may be some kind of wizard.

1752~~~
So he can assist too. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1753~~~
The media will probably say the bubble has burst if he doesn't score today, even though he's been excellent.

1754~~~
He has to be, if he can make Rooney score.

1755~~~
He dances like a butterfly and stings like a bullet!

"Smooth" Tony Martial

1756~~~
You know I believe he did.

At least its much more fun to think so!

1757~~~
His talent level and control/mastery are just miles ahead of the players around him.

1758~~~
Such strength to hold off defenders and speed to turn and dribble, looks amazing today. If he plays 90 he'll score. But he'll come off soon I suspect.

1759~~~
Despite being 19, he is easily our best attacking player.

1760~~~
Credit where its due, brilliant buy from LVG. He'll be a star no doubt. And how comes he's so strong?

1761~~~
He's like the extreme opposite of static, quick movement and close control.

1762~~~
Here it goes...he'll be the best striker in the league in three years.

1763~~~
He really does have the potential to be the best striker around. Amazing with the ball at his feet, so composed, so strong and quick. All despite being only 19.

1764~~~
Such a fecking excellent player. He has absolutely everything -- quick feet, pace, composure, skill, awareness, can head the ball, beat a man, is clinical and he's only 19. What a buy. One of the best teenagers I've ever seen.

1765~~~
The guy is just a complete forward. Great to watch.

1766~~~
His confidence in the ball is amazing.

1767~~~
Please score <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1768~~~
This guy.

I like him. 

No frills, fluff or hot air. Just fundamental football. He's football's Tim Duncan

1769~~~
Is there any real weakness to his game? 

He can dribble, he can beat a man, he can finish, he has great composure, he's quick, his headed attempt showed great technique from a standing jump, his hold up play is first rate, he's strong. 

He's 19 for feck sake, it's disgusting. I love it.

1770~~~
He doesn't need to score today. That's how good he is.

1771~~~
He has everything to be a proper CF. Benzema comparisons not totally ridiculous. While Martial looks "skinnier" he has the same physical presence.

1772~~~
Doesn't look like he's going to score today. But I think this was his best performance yet.

1773~~~
Top player. Hard to believe he's just 19.

1774~~~
He can't be 19.

1775~~~
MOTM for me, causes defenders untold problems -- just excellent today. His hold up play is exceptional.

1776~~~
I would love to see if he is capable of scoring outside the box. It is not a necessity for him to have, but I feel with that in his locker, he would draw more and more comparison to true world class striker like Suarez, who I believe Martial is more similiar to because of his technical ability and assertiveness.

1777~~~
Yep. He hasn't yet had a shot from range so we're not sure what his shooting is actually like as his finishes have all been so composed and his overall play is so smart and not wasting plays by taking shots unnecessarily. But if he has the shooting from range, then his potential is even more frightening then it already is.

1778~~~
What's becoming quite apparent, and startling, is that he actually looks like a £50m bracketed player from what we've seen so far. Everything he does has that touch of class you expect in the elite company and what he's given us thus far is the kind of play we'd have expected from a Griezmann or that level of signing.

Even when he doesn't score, he can have a very good game.

It's mental to think this is the base he's starting his career with us from.

1779~~~
I was laughing when the Balon d'Or clause was included. Well Monaco's having a laugh now.

1780~~~
He's absolutely brilliant. As <a class="username" data-user="10238, @Fortitude" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/10238/">@Fortitude</a> said, this guy is only 19. He can only improve.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1781~~~
Did absolutely everything today. A true CF. 

I am incredibly impressed with him.

1782~~~
He's the real deal. What a mature player for a 19 year old. Ran the show today at times. He could win us the league this year.

1783~~~
MotM for me today again. His all around play is brilliant. There is really no weakness to his game at all, that we've seen so far at least. Yet to see how his shooting from range is and if he's a decent header of the ball at goal, but pretty much everything else is already at a really high level. Despite him only being 19. Hopefully he stays injury free, because he's already a top player.

1784~~~
Quality, would like to see us get the ball into his feet more often he's got good awareness and can turn defenders + brings others into play.

1785~~~
Wow, he is incredibly good and a complete forward!

1786~~~
He seems to have all the tools to be a top player for us, for a long time.

Can hold up the ball, take on defenders, find a man.  Really like what I'm seeing but still early days so won't go too crazy at this point.  but I'm excited for what could be.

1787~~~
excellent today, man of the match. the turn for the 2v1 situation he created for him and memphis was brilliant.

1788~~~
Martial's 19 years old and he is carrying our attack on his back. Hasn't been a teenager to be this effective in the Premier League since the days of Anelka and Owen. His impact on this Man Utd is even bigger than that of Rooney of the United of 2005.

1789~~~
Can't believe he's only 19. Didn't score, but played very well and his all-around game is great. I think he was fouled at least 5 times today.

Seems like we've hit gold.

1790~~~
Love him.

1791~~~
This guy blows my mind. How can he be so good at 19? He was playing like he had at least 10 years of experience in the PL. Crazy.

Credit to whoever said "feck it, we'll pay!" this summer. I'm guessing it was Woodward.

1792~~~
Too had Memphis didnt gave it back to Martial so he could get that record

1793~~~
He has it all.. Great performance.

1794~~~
A snip at 36m......and eventually a snip at the supposed addons of 56m. Well done LVG...you were right.

1795~~~
Didn't score but that was possibly his best game for us. He's clearly not just a poacher!

1796~~~
MOTM. His best game so far. How is he so complete for 19 years?

1797~~~
We struck a gold. A fecking big chunk of gold.

1798~~~
Freakishly good for his age. I was excited when we signed him despite never really having heard of him, because if our scouts were willing to take such a risk, they must have seen something special in him. So far it looks like they've been bang on with this one.

1799~~~
don't understand how could Memphis miss the brilliant chance created by Martial, he had so many options what to do, could have easily be 0+2 for Martial today, he was brilliant, his hold up play is the biggest surprise for me, he's becoming one of my favorite players, imagine how beasty he can be in say 4 years

1800~~~
Our scouting team has done a great job finding this guy and insisting that he is worth the amount we paid him. With barely a proper season under his belt, it amazes me how he was a relative unknown before the fee we paid for him. Our scout team deserve a huge pay raise for this acquisition.

1801~~~
I think he leaves the likes of Griezmann in the dust in terms of his potential.

He has instantly become probably our best attacking threat in the space of a few weeks which whilst doesn't say much about the competition he has at this club, the way he is striking fear into every defence he has been up against at such a tender age suggests he is going to be some player.

Very unique modern style forward, he has the talent to almost redefine the position for the modern age if he keeps going like this and becomes that ballon d'or level player we hope he'll become. One thing which I like about him is that he seems to be like Drogba with his back to goal and on the ball he is like a direct version of Henry/Eto'o. Interesting to see how he develops his aerial game in the box as well as from long balls, and the long shots.. but yes his base is terrific to start from.

There is something about his mentality and confidence which I think is very top bracket, type of player who would be a big big danger in the big matches.

1802~~~
The difference between him and Depay is enormous just now.

1803~~~
Easily MOTM today...again. Which is absurd considering hes a 19 year old french kid we just bought from Ligue 1

1804~~~
as good as he is, he is 19. hope we dont burn him out.

but I trust van Gaal and Giggs to look after the lad.

1805~~~
Can't really add much

His best game for us even though he didn't score

His strength and composure and skill is frightening

1806~~~
Properly good even when he doesn't score... Very encouraging.

1807~~~
Absolutely top game. What a quality all round player he is. Love it.

1808~~~
I found this funnier than I should have.

1809~~~
Looks very good, can't wait to see how he develops.

1810~~~
The story is that it's Giggs who scouted him and tried everything to convince LVG to sign him.

1811~~~
Really impressive performance, defenders are shit scared of him.

1812~~~
This boy is ridiculous - them touches in teh first half surrounded by 3 sunderland players where he kept the ball! His runs, srtength etc. He;s only 19!

1813~~~
Improve? I couldn't care less if this is already his peak.

1814~~~
Need to do a bone density test on his wrist Freddy Adu style.

1815~~~
He's going to be so good

1816~~~
For me how he played today is just as important as his performance against Southampton. Faced two brick houses in O'shea and Kaboul and dominated them physically. 19 years old FFS.

1817~~~
What an overpriced flop!! Wheres all the Martial fanboys. Couldnt even score past a sunderland team as bad as that? I bet Welbeck could have scored past that lot! <span style="color: #ffffff">Lols</span>

1818~~~
Monster of a player! His hold up play and dribbling in wide areas are fantastic. 

As someone said, he's just a complete center forward

1819~~~
Best panic buy ever!

1820~~~
Without a goal, but I think he showed another level today.

That little shuffle of the ball past Skrtel wasn't luck. He pulled off similar skills a few times today.

The scouting, Woodward, Van Gaal, Giggs, the agent...everyone deserves credit for finding this man and bringing him to Old Trafford.

1821~~~
Best piece of business United have done since Ronaldo.

1822~~~
fecking hell, he looks like a finished product already, immense talent!

1823~~~
More meant that if we had paid for a £50m rated player, this is the kind of footballer we'd have expected to get in return - the kind of player with obvious class and refinery to everything they do, like Griezmann, as an example. 

He looks like the kind of young talent you expect to see go to the top, like so many others who followed that path. It's all very promising for us.

Before he got here, all the talk of contract stipulations for WPOTY etc seemed far-fetched to people like me who'd never heard of him, but now, it looks like a genuine possibility and a perfectly logical thing for Monaco to put in, if he fulfils the potential he looks like he has. 

I think even those who want to hold back and judge him over a number of games are starting to be won over now. His first full game, he doesn't score, and he looks the most impressive he has done in our shirt. Not often you can say that about a striker, let alone a 19yr old!

1824~~~
Very good performance, and good assist too, could have another assist if Depay does his job

1825~~~
Did great today. His passing was a bit sloppy at times, but that is okay..he is still young. I can't imagine what kind of player he will be 4 years from now.

1826~~~
Wasn't he more of a winger for Monaco, cutting in from the left? He seems so natural in the CF position. I'm very impressed with his hold-up play and tactical maturity.

1827~~~
Agreed.

1828~~~
I think we've bought him before he went "BOOM!"

His goalscoring form towards the end of last season was impressive, he put in some excellent performances against Valencia in the CL qualifiers and he's carried the same vein of form straight into the United side.

We've timed it perfectly, it seems.

1829~~~
He was in the first half, but that was to bed him into the team. Second half of the season and the start of this season he was being integrated as more of a striker and the majority of his goals came in 2015. He's always been mainly a striker who can play wide.

1830~~~
Like Van Gaal was saying. We had the chance to wait for a year for him to develop more, but then his price would've sky rocketed even more and others would be in without a doubt. Now we paid big, but got him right away and are reaping the rewards.

1831~~~
This lad is fecking brilliant.

1832~~~
He's so, so good! Getting better and showing us more and more each game!

His talent is incredible.

1833~~~
Hold up, Hold up, The tricks and the technical ability and the dribbling and the finishing are all good and all, but can I just say that Martial is a hell of a physical presence. I was seriously laughing my arse off at him today, playing like he was freaking Drogba. He looks a bit rangy but he seems insanely strong at holding off defenders. You never get the feeling like he's a Bambi on ice like so many other young, tall footballers.

1834~~~
Amazing all round play for him. Not only is he ice cold in front of goal but he also has an eye for his team mates. He looks like a super versatile striker. The only thing that might need a bit of work with him is his heading but hell the lad is only 19, lots of time to bring this up to the rest of his game and he will be a perfect all-round striker like Lewandowski.

1835~~~
He was more playing like an inside forward than a real winger.

1836~~~
We also had a bit of luck, in that Monaco were unlikely to sell him if they'd made the CL group stage. 

It's like all the stars just aligned for him to be here. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1837~~~
Is there any Young striker U21 that has as much potential as he does? Any mentions.

1838~~~
Can't think of any. He's such a confident lad. A joy to watch.

1839~~~
Angel Correa at Atletico is an exciting prospect.

1840~~~
Definitely his best display for us imo. Got so much to his game and just the sort of attacher we've needed for ages. Really positive signs.

1841~~~
Absolutely fantastic. His best overall performance for us, even without the goal. 

Such a complete package already... I hope he has the hunger to learn and improve, because he'll be one of the top names in football if he does.

1842~~~
Best teenager in the world right now?

1843~~~
I thought Correa was a winger.

1844~~~
Isn't he an attacking mid / winger?

1845~~~
He's incredible.

1846~~~
Hands down. What a star

1847~~~
Pace, dribbling, fantastic close control, cool as a cucumber, finishing, hold up play, good in the air... I've been putting off getting giddy because of our terrible luck the past few years but this kid as it all.

1848~~~
Martin Odegaard and Alen Halilovic might have something to say about that.

1849~~~
Any highlight videos yet?

1850~~~
Strength, pace, great feet, unselfish, composed.

I think we're witnessing something very special with this guy.

1851~~~
He is the type of striker that we needed and he is showing it through his performances thus far. He has single handedly taken our attack up a notch.

1852~~~
He has a daughter. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Didn't even know that till now.

1853~~~
Better than both of them.

1854~~~
Halilovic is miles behind Martial in terms of current experience, performances and overall impact in his career.

1855~~~
Great potential but are they playing top flight football putting in MoTM performances as of right now?

1856~~~
LvG: "I'm very pleased with Anthony because he is not only a goalscorer, he is also an attacking point and he also prepares goals. So for us Martial is more important than I thought before he came."

Basically saying he is the team to stay!

1857~~~
Must be, it would even be hard for oppo fans to suggest otherwise.

1858~~~
Feel free to disagree, but I disagree with your disagreement. :P
That is probably because he cannot break into that current XI at Barcelona. Not many in the world can. So he's off on loan getting experience. 
Odegaard is 16. It'll be a while before he can compete for a top spot at Real.


I don't want to derail the thread, though. 
Top of the table feels so good. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1859~~~
Kind of answered that yourself really then, he's 16, of course he isn't going to be better.  

Lets stay there!

1860~~~
Magnificent player, he's got to be one of the most complete forwards out there in terms of ability. Doesn't have many weaknesses.

I really rate his hold up ability, he can make things happen even when there's an opposition player as tight as holding onto his shoulders.

1861~~~
<a class="username" data-user="82657, @Gandalf Greyhame" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82657/">@Gandalf Greyhame</a> ivaldo said ''right now'', so there's nothing to argue about here really. We're talking about performances, not potential.

1862~~~
Today was almost more encouraging in that he can have that much influence on a game, even without scoring. He has that rare knack that the best players have of making difficult things look easy. I couldn't be more excited about watching him progress over the next few years.

1863~~~
Ah, dunno how I missed that part. Agreed, then.

1864~~~
Its such a change to Falcao just falling over when someone came that close.. Cant be happier we got him now - our team really needed it.

1865~~~
They're not even close.

1866~~~
he is sooo good its startling. We are a completely different team with him as a focal point, he encourages players to get forward and join him

1867~~~
Not even best at united... Has to be Shaw <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1868~~~
This lad is rather special isn't he? I thought he was fantastic today, great hold up play, fast feet and everything we need in the number 9 position. Shame Depay didn't pass to him for a simple tap in, but I also don't blame Depay for taking the shot on either.

1869~~~
I think being 20 probably discounts Shaw. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

1870~~~
Impressed me more today than in the games where he scored, just due to his incredible hold up play and dribbling. Every time he gets the ball in the box he's a real threat. I think he will earn us a fair few penalties this season.

1871~~~
He is really is abit good, isn't he??  Certainly not a Macheda 'flash in the pan' type, Im already certain of that.

Loved his hold play and his maturity on the ball.  And he is strong: once he fills out, he will be Mark Hughes 'hard as nails'.  But the latest new thing I learned about him today is his ability to create fear and panic because of his high speed close ball control.  Its deadly inside the box and will lead the plenty of local scoring opportunities for himself and also penalties when defenders haul him down.

And all that before the Old Trafford coaches, Giggs, Rooney and Mata have been able to teach him a few new tricks.

1872~~~
If he can keep this form going he's going to easily be our player of the year. Our static attack before he arrived has become fluid and so dangerous with him in it. He's a joy to watch. 

He may not keep this kind of form up all season, but at least from the quality we've seen so far, we know there is a real star there.

1873~~~
if he continues this form it's one of the best buys we made, surely. even at that price.

1874~~~
Well said by many already. That was a very impressive performance from Martial. He may not have scored, but was absolutely key to the performance and win today. He displays strength, intelligence and composure beyond his years. We knew he has pace and dribbling ability, but I was very impressed with his hold up play. Sunderland are not good, but they have some experience in their squad and Martial showed that he can be a focal point in leading the line. Sunderland (O'Shea in particular) tried to intimidate him physically, but he wasn't deterred. Without taking anything away from his potential - which is huge - the boy has proven that he has an important role to play this season. Patience and care with his development will still be required, but what an exciting player!

1875~~~
Didn't score so I think we're gonna have to cut our losses and get rid in January.

1876~~~
I genuinely hate how he's now stuck on that 2 goal record with Macheda and Saha. It would help my ocd a lot better if he wasn't. Aerially seems to be a weakness for him otherwise he's impressive elsewhere.

1877~~~
He's scored 4 goals. 3 in the league.

1878~~~
Was very good because he gives us what we needed. We were looking towards Depay but this guy can go down both sides and be a threat. It's good he's settled and with child. Didn't know who he was before we bought him but he's really important to how we play and I think the likes of Rooney, Depay, Mata will benefit. Unlucky not to have had two assists.

1879~~~
Very entertaining game, Martial was looked dominant.

1880~~~
Damn time flies... And here I was thinking I'll get one over by being smart <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1881~~~
Ocd better already

1882~~~
Is Shaw still a teenager?

1883~~~
He's absolutely the real deal. its just a question of please dont get injured #wrapincottonwool

1884~~~
Well its fairly obvious really. One isn't doing anything because he's 16 years of age. One is on loan to an average team. Martial is leading the line for Manchester United and surprising pretty much everyone with his performances.

Self explanatory really.

Sun 4 Oct 16:00 

Next two games before the international break. Both of these teams will play an open game and try and win, which creates space for Martial. Will be interesting to see what he can do in games where he'll have the opportunity to read the defences and position himself accordingly. 

We'll get a good look at his off-the-ball positioning and intelligence and whether he has that predatory instinct to figure out where the weak links are like the real top, top class forwards do.

1886~~~
Only injury can stop him.

1887~~~
Still can't get over how good his overall play is for a 19 year old. What a talent! Didn't score today, but was still massively infuential to our play, and that's what you need from strikers.

1888~~~
Shhh. Ffs! <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

1889~~~
This kid is perfect for us. United have always had superstars, and this kid is a superstar in the making.

1890~~~
I think we're at the point where he's being overrated finally. Very tidy performance and I think we've forgotten what it looks like when a striker actually contributes to our play without scoring but half the people who voted think he was MotM today ahead of Blind and Mata as well as an 8.1 overall. Today was a 7, maybe a 7.5 I think what is exciting is it was those for all different reasons to his previous performances.

1891~~~
You have to take into consideration his age and the fact that he's only played five games for us, though, anation of those games were 10 minute cameos.

1892~~~
<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>
You shush it.

1893~~~
You've got a point. The reason why he's so highly rated is him having basically changed the dynamics of the team. Having De Gea and Martial in the team has been a massive difference to the team. 

The next stage for this teams development is replacing Rooney and getting Shaw back to his best.

1894~~~
he's currently doing what RVP and Falcao couldn't do

1895~~~
I thought this performance was his most promising - because of his overall game being so good. Kaboul absolutely shat himself, terrified of his pace and getting turned.

1896~~~
Easily done, I had to Google it to make sure. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1897~~~
Excellent display today, really thought Depay would've squared that one chance back to him for a tap in but nevermind. His strength is crazy for a 19 year old.

1898~~~
And Rooney. But Falcao and and RvP were putting in 4's and 5's all last season when they didn't score, just making the point that simply contributing doesn't make it a MotM performance. It has a disproportionately large impact on our attacking play because it allows the rest of the forwards space, but then again that is what strikers *should* be doing.

1899~~~
didn't score get rid

1900~~~
He's going to be brilliant for us if he keeps this up.

His hold up play is brilliant,Drogba like at times.

1901~~~
Absolutely massive potential. Pace, strength, quick feet and composure in front of goal, and he is only 19. He is a greater talent than Ronaldo was at 19. Ronaldo showed great potential but not as much end product as Martial does. I rate him higher than Benzema if Martial can maintain this form, and there is every reason to believe that he will be a monstrous player in 2-3 years' time. He is already our best striker.

1902~~~
Kenny Cuningham looked at that performance and said he needs to work on his game to be top class, the ball kept bouncing off him and be needs to work on having his back to goal
Pat Nevin claiming United finding Martial as the answer was luck.
Setanta Sports ladies and gentlemen, they had the game live at 3 and named him motm!

1903~~~
So MOTM awards should only be awarded when players do something beyond what they should be doing instead of being, you know, the best player on the pitch during the match? His hold up play was fantastic and he should/could have come out of the match with two assists - those assists involved some sublime pieces to play to deliver chances on the plate for his teammates. People can go overboard with praise for a fan favourite, I will give you that, but Martial was one of the three genuine contenders for MOTM today.

1904~~~
He is showing unreal potential. Seriously, these performances at 19 year old...

1905~~~
He is sensational. Can we brand "feck off Madrid" onto his forehead?

1906~~~
Don't be silly and actually read my posts.

1907~~~
That's the kinda thing that will make him want to leave

1908~~~
No, just no.

1909~~~
Don't even suggest it. I'll cry if he goes to Madrid in a few years.

Odegaard <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Freddy Adu would like a word.

1910~~~
A wife too..with another kid  on the way too.. a responsible father is our Martial.

1911~~~
The way he has started, people will expect him to turn up every match. He is only 19 don't forget and will have his ups and downs and we will need to be patient with him. Now go smash that Hattrick against Wolfsburg lad!

1912~~~
He is just way ahead of average Homo sapiens. Be it football or real life.

1913~~~
"just making the point that simply contributing doesn't make it a MOTM performance" then you go on to state that he is simply doing what a striker should be doing. That's what you posted and that was after you said he getting 'slightly overrated' for doing things strikers ought to be doing like there is a hundred strikers doing what this kid has been doing for us since coming in. The point is he has done very well all things considered.

1914~~~
Another strong performance that could have resulted in two assists, he just has everything in his game that you want in a modern #9 and he's only just getting started.

1915~~~
The scary thing..he is just getting better...in both!

1916~~~
Nah disagree, he was ace today, 8 is spot on IMO. Almost every contribution he made was positive. While it would be silly to make any bold claims after 3 starts and 2 sub appearances, he really does look the real deal. It all looks effortless to him.

1917~~~
More like put a clause in his contract that foresees the inevitable if he keeps this up.

1918~~~
Yup. We look like a right mess with Depay and Mata both nearly exclusively cutting inside and now when Rooney is back he likes to operate in that area as well and he's impulsive and where he will be is hard to predict for his opponents and his teammates. It is almost an impossible job for a striker to have the versatility and intelligence to adjust accordingly to all of that but Martial did exactly in this game especially. 

There was a point in the game when Mata dropped to the central midfield, and before it meant we had no threat out wide but Martial had made his way out right to play as a winger. In a very mature way, not hunting the ball but actually playing the role of keeping width and he did the same when Rooney dropped deep or when Depay cut inside. 

The strikers who do have the intelligence to move out wide rarely have the ability to actually beat their man and create something as well, like when Rooney ends up out there. We don't need a world class striker like Falcao or RVP, we need someone who suits the team and Martial has been that player for us so far.

1919~~~
Neither of those things mean what you claim they do in their original context. And the latter is is again nonsense.

1920~~~
In short: We need a striker who can also play as a winger just as we need wingers who can also perform as strikers to secure the interchangeability of our players' positions and maintain maximum flexibility in our possession based approach. It's no surprise that Memphis and Martial have linked up so well together. The M&M's are gonna be plenty of fun to watch going forward.

1921~~~
He ran into a few too many blind alleys and his general passing was pretty poor at times. As I said, it was a good performance and exactly what we need from him as nobody but Messi puts in 8/10's every week but it wasn't a <i>great</i> performance.

1922~~~
Remember to turn down sound.

Edit: My favourite bit at 27".

1923~~~
His feet are so quick it's insane, could dribble his way out of anything.

1924~~~
He's genuinely brilliant. His maturity is astounding.

1925~~~
He's playing well and is obviously very talented but when you have certain people saying he has the potential to 'redefine the position for the modern age' you just have to laugh.

1926~~~
If he continued to perform to a level where Madrid came sniffing, Madrid would have to break the £100m transfer fee barrier to even get a conversation started.

1927~~~
I'm mostly impressed by how calm and composed he is. Brilliant attitude.

1928~~~
I was really worried about this transfer. Seemed like a punt. He's continuing to prove me and everyone else wrong.. Was he this good at Monaco? His stats there were nothing really special. 

Properly excited about his progress, he can be a real star

1929~~~
Is there a song for him yet? 

Or is everyone still spending the 90 minutes rubbing their eyes in disbelief and wiping away tears of joy.

1930~~~
Keep him the feck away from Kevin Davies, is all I ask.

1931~~~
I wish people would stop shitting it about fecking Madrid every time we have a gem on our hands.

1932~~~
<img alt=":keano:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/keano.gif" title="Keano    :keano:"/>

"There is a man, a certain man, and for the Reds you can be sure that he'll do all he can..."

1933~~~
Amen. Worry about things when they happen and enjoy what's in front of you!

1934~~~
Yep, just 'Oh Anthony Martial' to the tune of Seven Nation Army. Basically our RVP replacement <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

1935~~~
Honestly, we struck gold with this guy. I knew he was talented when we bought him, but had no clue he'd be so good already. His attitude is amazing as well.

1936~~~
He started last season as a bench option, it was only later in the season he became a starter. 9 in his last 12 for them is pretty dang good, especially when he often played on the wing for them.

1937~~~
Good to hear.

I love this left-of-field signings, reminds me of prime SAF. Him playing wing explains the average stats.. the guy is clearly a CF

1938~~~
Was shitting bricks when he went down for a bit. I was expecting him to be in and out of the team but, while he will need to be managed to a degree - he has got to be starting most games. Hope LVG continues to let him keep going the way he is in taking defenders on, it's so nice to have a player going direct. Other players in the squad need to get their tails up - he is going to very soon I think become the player getting the most focus from other teams - much like Fellaini got after causing all kinds of problems for the likes of City, Spurs and Liverpool. Unfortunately then, no one picked up the slack, cannot let that happen this time.

Absolute joy to see this guy play right now.

1939~~~
So glad we signed him under the noses of the big clubs. I am sure if we would have waited a year he would be at the top clubs around Europe. Great signing and that amount we paid (and might pay) is looking like chump-change right now! A complete striker and an attacking outlet for us. With him and Memphis getting double-marked, it is opening free space for the likes of Rooney and Mata along with our fullbacks giving more opportunities to score.

1940~~~
We're not Accrington Stanley, you know.

1941~~~
I never meant we were not. Probably I should have posted "he would be at <b>other</b> top clubs around Europe"

All in all I am just glad we pounced on him. Kind of reminds me of CR signing, one day you know him as an opposition in a friendly game and the next you are singing him.

1942~~~
During the game, I kept rubbing my eyes in disbelief. It's a fantasy.

1943~~~
Difference between the Fellaini one and this is that once Fellaini gets marked, there is very little he can provide except for chesting down long balls. Martial will run his marker ragged. His movement is sublime, he runs the channels well, his close control and dribbling are top notch, he has a brilliant turn of pace and his ability to roll his man is also very good. I think teams will find it very hard to mark him out of a game. With so many strings to his bow, he will cause issues irrespective of what the opposition plans for him.

1944~~~
Except <a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a>, few on here had heard much about him and obviously were concerned that we were going to rely on a horribly out of form Rooney and a teenager from Ligue1 to get us goals.

I think we got him at exactly the right time. Every exceptional player has a breakout year where he actually announces himself as finally having arrived. I just feel this could be Martial's season to let the world know he is the real deal and no longer just potential.

1945~~~
Come on. Unfair on the kid to be compared to Messi. I understand where you are coming from but he got one assist and nearly another. His general play was also very good. You could say Blind is also a contender for MOTM but I think Martial just edged it considering his age and that he just joined our club.

Players like Young were given MOTM last season for far less.

1946~~~
That's not what I was doing though was it? And he was playing against the weakest defence in the league, it was between Blind and Mata for MotM. His age and inexperience make the fact he's putting in good performances even when he isn't scoring exciting, but they don't make suddenly make them great performances.

1947~~~
True enough but, as teams end up putting more than just one player on him, it will become quite a difficult for him to be as impactful without others stepping up is the point. Like when Chelsea put 2 people on Fellaini last year, that really should have meant more room for a few others but, the team failed to adequately capitalize on it. With Martial as you said, his movement and running of the channels will open up even more space and opportunities - hopefully we take full advantage of it.

1948~~~
You guys need to stop this notion that LVG prevent players from taking on defenders. It's not true and it will never be true.

1949~~~
We had problems against Chelsea because Carrick was injured not because they have 7 players on Fellaini.

1950~~~
It really is laughable that people still believe that, Depay hasn't been dropped so far and he's the one who constantly loses the ball and tries to take on defenders.

1951~~~
Chelsea just put Zouma on Fellaini from what I recollect and that completely neutralized his threat. If teams put more than one player on Martial then the fowards in our frontline will definitely use the extra space.

1952~~~
It was not a great performance but a very good one. You are entitled to your view and perhaps Blind or Mata edged it in your eyes but for many Martial provided more than them. 

As for him being up against one of the worst defenses, Blind was similarly up against one of the weakest attacks and yet they had a fair few cracks at our goal. I don't see you holding that while appreciating Blind's performance. I think Blind's ability on the ball does cover up some defensive deficiencies in his game.

1953~~~
Immense, i love his assist to Rooney, and Deapy should really have done better when Marital put him clean on goal, because that was quite special. Also, i love that little piece of skill he shows at around 7:00. Nothing came from it, because Kaboul(?) tracked back well, but i remember getting real exited for a second there

I read someone saying his hold up play reminded them of Drogba, and his dribbling ability reminded them of Henry. Imagine if he turns into a player combining the strengths of those two <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1954~~~
The turn that created that Memphis chance was immerse <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1955~~~
Even he spent half season on bench and on wing, scoring 12 goals is still very good stats for a 18 years old. Rooney at similar age only scored 9, Ronaldo only scored 6, Messi only scored 8. And we are talking about the best 3 teenagers in past decade, 2 of which went on to become best goalscorer/player of all time in football history.

Here's the comparison (roughly as they are born in different months):

<b>Ronaldo</b> scored <span style="text-decoration: underline">6 goals in 40 games</span> at age 18, then <span style="text-decoration: underline">9 goals in 50 games</span> at age 19 (winger)
<b>Messi</b> scored <span style="text-decoration: underline">8 goals in 25 games</span> at age 18, then <span style="text-decoration: underline">17 goals in 36 games</span> at age 19 (wing forward)
<b>Rooney</b> scored <span style="text-decoration: underline">9 goals in 40 games</span> at age 18, then <span style="text-decoration: underline">17 goals in 43 games</span> at age 19 (no.10)
<b>Henry</b> scored <span style="text-decoration: underline">3 goals in 22 games</span> at age 18, then <span style="text-decoration: underline">10 goals in 48 games</span> at age 19 (winger/wing forward)

<b>Martial</b> scored <span style="text-decoration: underline">12 goals in 46 games</span> at age 18, and so far scored <span style="text-decoration: underline">4 goals in 5 games</span> at age 19 (winger/striker)

Of course we have others once-a-decade teenage sensationals like Owen (23 goals in 44 games) and Brazilian Ronaldo (35 goals in 36 games) who had scored alot during their teens, but they are more of a pure striker at the very beginning. Neymar scored alot too (42 goals in 60 games) but in Brazil so its hard to compare.

1956~~~
That's exactly what I meant, he was comfortably one of our top three performers yesterday and as such he is a legitimate MOTM contender. And the player ratings are dependent on the teams' in the match not what Messi would have done in Barcelona, an 8/10 rating will still be found in a Sunderland v Bournemouth match as a function of how a particular player affected that said match.

You are correct in pointing out how the defense let Sunderland in on a few occasions which would count against Blind as he is part of that defense. Mata, on the other hand, was very wasteful on set pieces. So it is not ridiculous to point out that Martial's was the more complete performance without bringing his age into the argument.

1957~~~
I just got back from a Muse show, and kept replacing the words to the chorus of "Mercy" to "Martial."

1958~~~
Yep some people genuinely think LVG is preventing Rooney from beating players.

1959~~~
Never Wayne's fault though...

1960~~~
He's got full package, doesn't he? We've already known that he's pacey as hell, got great finishing, is strong, fantastic footwork and dribbling but he's surprised me with his brilliant vision yesterday and how altruistic he was. That chance he's created for Depay in the second half, he's scored with Rooney, there's probably something more that I can't remember at the moment, what a player he is. God save him from injuries and I seriously can't see him not being a huge success. Got to love him really.

1961~~~
Looking at the highlights I was very impressed. He has quick feet and a great ability to take a ball into feet and then turn the defender. He is also very pacy and seems the right balance between a predator but unselfish.

The only downsides was that he did run into a few blind alleys, but I think as much as anything our other attacking players should anticipate him turning defenders and run past him to create space and offer an option. His passing is also a bit wayward at times.

These aren't meant as criticisms just observations as he is still only fecking 19 and amazing for a player of that age

1962~~~
It's really hard not to get carried away by his performances, seems like he has that extra sec of thinking what to do when in the tight situtations, it's unbelieveable how calm and composed he is.

1963~~~
His heading and long-range shooting are the only things we have yet to see from him in his first 5 games with us, but I can't see both being much of an issue for him. I think we have a truly complete CF here lads, could probably play as the 10 if he put his mind to it. While he has shown the agility to beat his man as a winger too. He's looking like the player Fergie wanted Rooney to turn into when he did his Rooney out wide experiment years ago.

1964~~~
I really wanted us to rest him against wolfsburg but the loss at PSV means we need him to start

1965~~~
Anthony Martial is so good that he can literally use Rooney's knee as a cushion to help Rooney score a goal. To even read headlines like "Rooney scores to bring United top" is hilarious. Martial danced in the box through 3-4 defenders and then looked at Rooney and thought "aww, I feel for you lad" and goal, Rooney had no idea.

1966~~~
His part in the Rooney goal was fantastic, he never fails to amaze me watching him play. I know it's still early days but it just makes me laugh that the media was questioning this deal and thought Woodward and van Gaal had messed up big time.

1967~~~
He's so classy.. Will he be involved with France in the upcoming matches? I think he could probably do with a little break after the Arsenal match.

1968~~~
Exactly what I thought <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Unbelievable talent.I knew he's good before we sign him but didn't know he's this good.

1969~~~
We hardly shoot from long range as team. He had a good header which went just over yesterday. Coincidentally, it was an accusation thrown at Henry for most of his career. Hardly used his head but when you're that good with your feet, no one  cares.

1970~~~
There was a new song at the ground yesterday that I think might take off.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Sang to the music of "sweet Caroline" </span>
"Sweet Anthony, Martial, good times never been so good. 
Our number 9, Martial, scoring goals Falcao never could..."
(Repeat) I think further verses will be added if it gets going.

1971~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1972~~~
I did think that too..but seeing RVP, Falcao and Rooney this season too, you can see that the problems lie with the players.. all of them.

1973~~~
This makes no sense. Lvg didn't tell them to fall over everytime, have the first touch of an elephant or start huffing even after a jog.

1974~~~
I think he was agreeing with the post he quoted, he said the problem lies with the players and not the manager.

1975~~~
He probably will..but he usually comes off the bench for them..although with his form, the manager may want to try him out.

1976~~~
What Raw said..I am saying that the fault lies with all three players for their poor form..Falcao, Rooney and RVP.

1977~~~
Whenever he gets the ball I think 'something good is going to happen'. He's not just a technically gifted player, he's somebody who knows what he's doing and is almost impossible to stop by legal means. We hadn't had a individual who dominates the opposition like that since Scholes and now we have two (Bastian being the other). It's what Manchester United should be about.

If somebody told me he was 27 years-old and the club captain, I'd believe them based on his performances. I really hope the lad can keep up his standards. He's not just great 'for his age'. He's great, full stop.

1978~~~
Blind wasn't at fault defensively, he was also our most potent midfielder despite not actually playing there.

1979~~~
I just had a thought about how we are going to pay Monaco if he fulfills all the clauses. Is it possible to sell him to another team (say Salford) and then buy him back for the same price (obviously) and this would probably mean we won't have to pay Monaco the extra clauses. I'm not saying we're going to do it, but would it work?

1980~~~
My only gripe is he doesn't seem to have much talent in his left foot.

1981~~~
How would you sing the "Martial" bit?

1982~~~
Sounds like it's the part that goes 'do do do', so it would be sang like 'Mar tee al'.

Reckon the 'scoring goals Falcao never could' could do with changing though.

1983~~~
Yeh that's how it was sang, I agree on the Falcao bit and I think with time that will change

1984~~~
So Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A. was on the radio on the way to OT yesterday. At the game I had this version going round my head:

Born in the Stretford End!
He was, born in the Stretford End!
He's a true Red Devil from the Stretford End
Anthony Mar-she-al!
His name is Anthony Mar-she-al!

<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

1985~~~
Ah clever. Cheers.

1986~~~
Yet as a CB he let Sunderland's attacks have three-four clear shots at goal. Let us agree to disagree on this.

1987~~~
There are 4 defenders and 2 covering defensive midfielders.

1988~~~
So the blame falls on the rest and not on Blind?

1989~~~
No, the blame falls on the ones responsible. The allocation of blame is dependant on circumstance. So no Blind isn't at fault just because we conceded a chance unless, you know... he actually did something wrong. Which he didn't in this case.

1990~~~
You specifically said Blind
"He let Sunderland.."

So of course people will call you out on that and specifically defend Blind.

1991~~~
Even if it could work that time it would mean that no club would want to do a similar deal with us in future.

1992~~~
You're right - PSG would be the more obvious team for him to go to in this case.

1993~~~
Yeah that's one of the main reasons we wouldn't do it, but it's interesting to think about it in theory.

1994~~~
This, I doubt it would be legal but even if it was we'd jeopardise all our future transfer business.

1995~~~
PSG is a nothing club.

1996~~~
The clauses are probably relevant "whilst playing for Manchester United" or something. I doubt him moving in between would affect them.

1997~~~
It's really difficult not to get over-excited about this lad. He seems to have it all - big strong and fast with very quick feet. I find it reassuring that he doesn't really use fancy tricks when dribbling and relies on a good touch, good timing and good use of his body and change of pace. On top of all that he has so far seemed quite intelligent with the ball. There are definitely signs that he is getting used to the team and sometimes made passes to runs that didn't happen but he seems to know when to pass and when to be selfish more often than most young players.

That header attempt was decent as well.

We will have to see what he's like when he's out of form and how often that happens. Hopefully not for a long time yet.

1998~~~
Maybe in football manager, but it would never happen in real life. If you make a deal you stick to it.

1999~~~
It would be fairly slam dunk fraud. We'd be sued. MUFC and Salford are different corporate entities so collaborating like that to evade the terms of a contract would be illegal. I'm no legal expert, but I can't see how it would be otherwise.

2000~~~
If he meets those clauses then we will be more than happy to stump up the money.

2001~~~
No, that's not how contracts work. Monaco would sue us, and we would most certainly lose.

And even if it had worked - our ethos would be obliterated. No club would ever deal with us again unless we hand them all the money in one go, which would be a seriously damaging situation, even for a club as rich as Manchester United.

2002~~~
Emancipation was proclaimed a century and a half ago. <img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/> Racist!

<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2003~~~
Why would we want to destroy our relationship with Monaco and ruin our reputation for fair dealing over a few shekels? Evading rightful payment is no way for a top club to do business. Who are we, Barcelona? <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2004~~~
Neville putting some good analysis on him on MNF right now. If someone has recorded this, would be a great upload...

<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> <a class="username" data-user="32240, @Olly" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/32240/">@Olly</a> anyone?

2005~~~
What Nev is saying is something I noticed on Saturday too.

I think it was a first nudge by O'Shea in the game, when the ball wasn't near either of them. Martial stood strong to the nudge then just turned around and glared at O'Shea as if to say, "I'm not taking any of that today."

Fancied him to score on the weekend, but really pleased with his overall contribution.

2006~~~
It's difficult to say things which haven't already been said in this thread. I can honestly admit I hadn't seen him play before OR even heard about him so I couldn't have an opinion on the signing until I saw the guy play.

I'm totally surprised and can't believe how good this kid is! It feels like he was the missing piece to the LVG jigsaw. We've dominated games win, lose or draw but never had that deadly, ruthlessness in attack. He has instantly given that to us with his attributes. Memphis, Mata and even Rooney have come alive around him and it's so good to finally see our possession football finally have an end product. He's pushing the defence back so far our whole team can push right in!

I'm so excited to see how we fair in the next few games

2007~~~
Yeah it was a good little analysis from Neville of things I didn't really notice other than the chance he created for Memphis. The kid is tough.

2008~~~
still have it on my hdd
will  post it after the eve-wba match

2009~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/2vi9" width="560"></iframe>

this it?

2010~~~
^^  Thanks!

2011~~~
He's showing a lot of class but I do have to say you guys are overrating him a bit (which is totally normal. Anyone with such an impact at his age will be overrated like that). Another unpopular opinion I have is that him and Januzaj are of the same caliber. Is it wrong I feel like that?

2012~~~
It's not wrong, but you are wrong, they are not at the same level. Maybe they will be by the end of the season if Januzaj plays a lot with Dortmund but at the moment they are not at the same level.

2013~~~
No. Martial is showing more than Januzaj ever did.

Januzaj could be world class if he develops properly though.

2014~~~
I know what you're trying to say but I think the key difference between the two lies in their decision making. Martial shows the maturity and composure of a 29 year old who knows his role(s) inside out. Januzaj is capable of this however doesn't offer the same level of consistency during a match, Januzaj is capable of having one or two world class moments in a game yet still play a poor game and I think the best solution to this is regular playing time so he can exercise these decisions more in a match scenario. Dortmund is definitely the right club for him in terms of playing style, just hope he continues to get match-time.

Still early days for Martial but it's very reassuring and astonishing that he's got such completeness in his play.

2015~~~
From what the three of you have said, the only difference between the two is consistency and maturity. The consistency: it's still early days and we can't say for sure if Martial will be performing at this level on a consistent basis. If he does, which I really hope he does, then his consistency is much better than Januzaj's.

As for maturity/decision making, I think all Januzaj needs is game time. The only thing that makes me think Januzaj has more potential is the moments of brilliance he produces - his subtle movement/vision for through balls is just world class sometimes.

EDIT: If anything, I think they are both similar which I believe is an unpopular opinion as most would say Martial is way ahead of Januzaj .

2016~~~
I love Januzaj but IMO, Martial is far ahead of him. Martial is playing like a world class player already. With Januzaj, he always played more like an incredibly promising youngster but he never showed the level of intelligence, maturity and ability that Martial has so far. Martial is as good of a 19 year old as I've seen play for United really, from recent memory. Januzaj has loads of ability, but his decision making has always been questionable up until now and doesn't have anywhere near the physique that Martial has. That's the thing with Martial - Not only does he have the ability and maturity in his game that you wouldn't expect from a 19 year old, but he's also physically built like you would expect someone in their prime to be.

2017~~~
The thing is Martial has "done his job" on every occasion he's been asked to so far. I can't think of any game since his initial breakout period where Januzaj has done that. Too many good moments spoilt by bad ones immediately after.

2018~~~
Their positions and roles are too different to be worth comparing. And Martial's only played a handful of games, so still potentially in a honeymoon period, which lasted going on six months for Januzaj.

No useful comparisons to be made, really.

2019~~~
WTF? ppl completely forget about what Januzaj did in his first season, under Moyes he was arguably the best United player.. Martial has a long way to go, Januzaj was as confident as him, let's wait until he picks up a dip in the form and than judge. this is too early to make such conclusions, really..

2020~~~
Martial is on another level when it comes to making the right decisions.

The problem with Adnan is that he often don't know when to just make the simple pass instead of trying to dribble through a wall or making some fancy tricks.
He is with a good team now and under Tuchel he will learn to play more maturely. But it's nothing unusual for a 20 year old going through a rough spell, if you could even call it that.

Martial's start has been freakishly good, i would never have thought he would come in and just play like he had been with us for years.

2021~~~
Physically too. Strength, speed, and domination of opposing defenders.

2022~~~
Yeah, he got the whole package.

The physical part doesn't necessarily have to be improved that much for Januzaj, quick thinking and good decision making is more important for a player like him imo.
I see his future as a playmaker in the mould of Ozil or Silva, it's a big ask for him to be that good, but he definitely got the potential.

2023~~~
They are not on the same level, for me anyway. Januzaji even after his first season with us, where everyone hyped him up as the next best thing (including me), I still saw some big flaws in him to which I was not too optimistic about (decision making, selfishness, physically weak etc). Martial, on the other hand, was almost perfect in the way he has shown us signs of strength in almost every aspects of the game as forward/wing forward.

2024~~~
The pass to Depay showed so much maturity.

And credit for Rooney for taking him aside after that. Was obvious rooney was impressed by his decision to opt for the smarter play instead of going for glory.

2025~~~
the liverpool & soton goals certainly helps him a lot, rather than being under pressure to score now he is playing with more freedom and relaxed, as shown against sunderland.

his decision makings are excellent for a player of his age.

2026~~~
I don't remember this. Any gif of it?

2027~~~
Comparing Martial and Januzaj from a technical point of view isn't preposterous. It's a decent comparison.

Where Martial is streets ahead is with his physicality. If Januzaj had Martial's place and strength, he'd already be a star.

2028~~~
Pace and strength aside, I think it is their decision making and mental strength which make them miles apart.

2029~~~
Martial came to us already played 70 odd senior games for Monaco.Januzaj came to the first team after playing for bloody Manchester United Under-21.People love to make unnecessary comparison.It's normal for the one who has more senior experience to be more matured on his game despite being about the same age, doesn't mean much about their future.

2030~~~
These are the starts that immediately followed Sunderland

Januzaj looked like a world beater. Just look at that Norwich match and tell me that isn't really impressive. One thing Martial has over Januzaj is indeed pace and strength. These two things allow his dribbling to be more consistent. I bet people wouldn't question Adnan's decision making if he had actually pulled off some of his attempted dribbling. Inconsistency in dribbling can make you look like a star in one match, and make you look immature in the next match.

2031~~~
This. I think that Martial has a big advantage over Januzaj because of his physicality but it's too early to say that his decision-making is much better. Especially considering that what impressed me the most with Adnan when he broke through was exactly the same things, his decision-making and composure/confidence. I think your spot on with your last few sentances aswell.

2032~~~
I didn't see it either. The pundit on my feed mentioned it.

2033~~~
Yes, this is exactly my point as well.

2034~~~
Pace, physical and mental strength. That's THREE key attributes out of 5 or so that decide how good a footballer is. So alot then.

My guess: we won't see much of Januzaj again, if at all, after his Dortmund stint.

2035~~~
Martial and Januzaj are similar in that both have potential to be the best in the world in their position. But speaking about "current" contribution, Martial appears to be already way ahead of Januzaj. The former has 4 goals and 1 assist in 5 appearances this season while Januzaj has had a total of 5 goals and 3 assists in 24 appearances. As others have mentioned Januzaj doesn't have the needed attributes to perform now while Martial is very close to finished product.

2036~~~
Martial's much more developed, physically. So better able to handle himself in a robust league like the PL. Januzaj's still got a lot of filling out to do. Players develop at different rates. Januzaj can still come good. He's clearly very talented.

2037~~~
Lot of Januzaj for a Martial thread. There really is no comparison between the players. Martial has all the necessary attributes that Januzaj is lacking and shows few signs of developing. He's fast, strong, incredibly hard to knock off the ball and has great decision making. Januzaj has some wonderful skills and good vision, but without the other attributes he's not going to amount to much. It's too early to write Januzaj off and there's plenty of time for things to go awry in Martial's career but, right now, Martial points up all the areas in which Januzaj is deficient. Add to that that Martial is Januzaj's equal in technical skills and vision, and you get a complete package - something that I seriously doubt we'll ever be able to say about Januzaj. (Now, having said that, I can see a lot of similarities between Januzaj and Eriksen at the same age, so there is still hope - although perhaps not at the "United level".)

2038~~~
I think it's normal and warranted to make comparisons. They're both young attacking players with potential to be worldies. Right now one of them is doing much better than the other and we are just pointing out why that may be.

I firmly stand by my stance that Adnan will be a top player (playing for top 3 of La liga, or top 4 of PL) whether we get him back or not.

2039~~~
Does anyone else read the word "martial" in any sentence as "Mar-cee-al" regardless of its context now?

2040~~~
How is the French pronunciation of the word?

I still say Mar-tee-al.

2041~~~
Mar-see-al

2042~~~
Mar-shull


<span style="color: #ffffff">:P</span>

2043~~~
It's only two syllables, more like "mar-syal".

2044~~~
Yeah, I just didn't want to write Mar-sial, but Mar-Syal works

2045~~~
Mars-e-al

2046~~~
Marseille-al

2047~~~
Mars-ee-al, surely?

2048~~~
I don't think there is a rule about the "e" wants being pronounced short or long.

2049~~~
'e' sounds like é
'ee' sounds like the letter 'i' in French

2050~~~
The Martia-n (starring Matt Darmian)
<span style="color: #ffffff">I'm so sorry</span>

2051~~~
Riveting conversation lads.

2052~~~
I was going with the English alphabet.

2053~~~
Yeah but when you write 'e' in the phonetic sense in English, it's pronounced as 'é' or 'eh'

2054~~~
I am pretty sure it's Martial...

2055~~~
Surely the s sound is softer than in 'mars' as in the planet Mars and more like 'marsh'.

2056~~~
Nah

2057~~~
It wasn't phonetic for me <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/> otherwise I'd have used square brackets.

2058~~~
I don't know why we're arguing about this. It's making my day worse than it already was. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2059~~~
No, it's like Mars the 't' is pronounced like a 's'.

2060~~~
Anthony don't mess around
Because we love him so
And we all know he'll score
So now he's really gonna
make us pay the addons
for the ballon d'or
Don't try to stop us singing
'Cos the lad alone is killing you right now
Thank Ed and Louis van Gaal
for bringing him to England
We don't need Pedro now
Mar-tial!
Martial!
Mar-tial!
Martial!

To the tune of Hey Ya! by Outkast

2061~~~
Can't wait to see what he can do against Arsenals defense. They were all over the place defensively against Leicester and apparantly again yesterday. Also, I heard Koscielny picked up an injury? 

Martial vs Mertesacker and Chambers sounds like a good time.

2062~~~
Excited to see him up against Dante tonight. I really hope he has a good game tonight, i want his confident start prolonged.

2063~~~
Oh, that's really painful to read.

2064~~~
It's pronounced Tony Marshall, obviously.

2065~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Brilliant.

2066~~~
Looks like LVG has been vindicated so far getting rid of RVP.

2067~~~
Getting rid of RVP was good for all parties involved. For us, RVP wasn't the same player he was when we bought him and was still on huge wages. For RVP, he was still good enough to play somewhere in Europe - so for his own career it was a good move because he gets to still play and earn a pretty good wage. 

Martial is looking like he best replacement we could have bought, all things considering.

2068~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ouch that is so cringey

2069~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2070~~~
Honestly, it does scan.

2071~~~
Beating players at will, feck sake he is really really good.

2072~~~
He's incredible, fantastic player.

2073~~~
Most dangerous player for us by a mile. Ridiculous. I'm not sure Rooney was as good at the same age

2074~~~
He's bafflingly good.

2075~~~
He can't be 19.

2076~~~
This guy is an absolute monster.

2077~~~
He's actually scary good.

2078~~~
Excellent when running at defenders, really quick feet, excellent close control. Only 19.

2079~~~
He's a joke.

2080~~~
He's just not showing any weakness in any facet of the game. Phenomenal so far.

2081~~~
How the feck can he be so good at 19?

2082~~~
He will be a world beater next season. Incredible signing.

Makes our attack more threatening.

2083~~~
Forget Rooney, even Ronaldo wasn't this good at 19.

2084~~~
A joy to watch. Magical player.

2085~~~
If he stays with us for his peak career there will be statue of him outside the stadium

2086~~~
Martial is going in dry. Serving up the BBC. He's in the mood.

2087~~~
Hold-up and strength on the ball still needs a bit of work. But another amazing half for a 19-year-old; he does not seem fazed, is so quick and already really thinks like a striker. Was unlucky to be given offside the first time, and he was clean through too.

2088~~~
Is it too early to say he could well become the worlds best?

2089~~~
He absolutely shat on Rodriguez before he passed it to Rooney.

2090~~~
He's stupidly good.

2091~~~
No, it's too late.

2092~~~
It's actually comical how good he is, just casually shitting on a Champions League team at 19 years old. 

Fantastic player.

2093~~~
It's crazy how much attention he already receives from the opposition. I'm currently watching the game on German TV and the commentator has been shitting himself whenever Martial has been in a 1-on-1 situation.

2094~~~
Quick summary of your thoughts on his game in general?

2095~~~
That footwork before he shot with his left foot was great to see, he's got that quick thinking X-factor.

2096~~~
I suppose he is there already.

2097~~~
Way too early.

2098~~~
There's no way a 19 year old with minimal experience should be <i>this </i>good.

2099~~~
I was actually laughing my arse off when he was dancing through their defenders at will. It's fecking ludicrous. Rodriguez is a damn good full back too <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2100~~~
He's quality.

2101~~~
We have signed a superman. He can do anything! Shame Rooney didn't finish that chance...

2102~~~
True but I'd say Rooney was better (aka more consistent) at that age than Ronaldo

2103~~~
The second Memphis and Rooney ups their game, then our attack with him and Mata can be frightening.

2104~~~
Everytime he touches the ball, I think United will score. That kinda sums it up.

2105~~~
He's looking like the best young outfield player we've signed since Ronaldo for sure.

Not going to get any more ahead of myself yet even though it's tempting.

Edit: maybe since Smalling actually...

2106~~~
I don't have much hope left for Rooney. That was a bad miss today. Form is temporary and class is permanent and all that but...he has gone to shit.

2107~~~
At times the ball sticks to his feet like a certain player I dare not name. Joy to watch.

2108~~~
Sorry but that comment isn't hyperbolic enough to do him justice.

2109~~~
Best u21 player in the world by a distance. He looks the finished article already. We just need to get the ball to him more as he makes something happen every time he touches it. Ridiculous how good he is.

2110~~~
This.

2111~~~
Don't even go there.

2112~~~
The last player I can think who seemed to be so complete at 19 is Brazilian Ronaldo.

2113~~~
My worry is he's somehow lying about his age like Obafemi Martins, it's the only explanation.

2114~~~
Well he is bollocks in the air...

2115~~~
The impotency of this side when you can't get your best attacking player the ball more than 4 times in an entire half...

2116~~~
Hasn't scored in 2 games. Drop him.

2117~~~
Keeps impressing even though not scoring. Should have got an assist if Rooney didn't feck up.

2118~~~
Shame we ended up so defensive and couldn't get him on the ball more tonight, he is devastating.

2119~~~
He nearly always does something good when he has the ball. Can't say the same about ROONAY ROONAY!

2120~~~
The kid is the absolute business and he's doing it alone for the most part with Memphis fading in and out of games and Rooney fading in and out of consciousness.

2121~~~
Excellent again. Leads the line beautifully. So versatile as well, great to see. Hopefully we find him a better supplier at #10 soon.

2122~~~
Shame we didn't get him the ball enough in the 2nd half.

Another good performance though. The way he skinned Rodriguez in the 1st half was <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2123~~~
The best thing about him is the way he ghosts past players. Not tricks just body movements and pace. Wonderful to watch. Produces a wow moment every game and gets people on the edge of their seat. First touch is good. Could have done better with the header which he totally missed, putting dante to man mark him shows what his importance was.  Hope he continues to grow.

2124~~~
Imagine what damage he could have done with a remotely competent footballer behind him in no.10.

If only LvG still has his storied nutsack to drop Rooney. Second game in a row when he's set up another beautifully yet seen it go to waste.

2125~~~
You what mate? thats one of his best qualities. I feel like you had that in your head from when we signed him and were going to say it regardless.

2126~~~
Struggled to get involved in the second half. Or perhaps more accurately the team struggled to get him involved. He still looked class nearly every time he got on it though, that quick turn and through ball to set off a counter attack near the end was nice. Heading technique could use some work, but you can't have it all at 19!

2127~~~
As an attacking point Anthony Martial is one of the best players I've seen at his age. The way he glides past players is beautiful. Had Rooney been anywhere near decent he would have had an assist for sure, and he could have gotten another in the second half. The comparisons are becoming increasingly ridiculous but I can't remember a teenage number 9 this good since Anelka for Arsenal in 1997/98. He slices through defences like a hot knife through butter. If he keeps this up people will start likening him to a young Luiz Ronaldo.

2128~~~
He's brilliant. Absolute joy to watch. His dribbling is so good, and his hold up play is far too good for a 19 year old. Looks as if he's been playing for decades.

Why do I get the feeling though that headers is not his strongpoint? I don't mean knocking it down from a goalkick or something, but when in goal. I'm sure I heard/read over the weekend that it isn't his greatest quality. I guess you can't have it all I guess.

2129~~~
He gives up on some feisty duels bit easily at times especially when defender is desperate on the counter. Could improve his heading too.

Otherwise he's class as everyone would agree. We should have gotten him involved more.

2130~~~
Was isolated in the second half but first half he was really good.

2131~~~
I can't believe just how good he is already.

2132~~~
That aspect usually tends to improve with age.

2133~~~
He has shown some great touches with his back to goal, yes. But he still gets muscled off the ball or has it knocked away from him in these situations. For me, this part of his game has been inconsistent so far, but indeed very promising at such an early stage.

I don't wanna sound too harsh. His pace, dribbling, finishing etc is fantastic too for a man so young and finally we have someone who runs channels and can bring others into the game.

2134~~~
He's so much better than Rooney it's amazing

2135~~~
We couldn't get him involved much in the second half but he was good whenever he did get the ball. First half was very good again.

2136~~~
I really enjoy watching him run with the ball. He reminds me of a young owen or giggs. So direct, with the ball stuck to his feet.

2137~~~
Rooney's horrendous miss kind of sums the two of them up at the moment. Nice bit of play from Martial who manages to create a very good chance, which is embarrassingly squandered by Rooney.

2138~~~
Did well in first half, second half, we struggled to get the ball to him.

2139~~~
The nature of playing with your back to goal is you are not going to win every ball - You think Suarez/Aguerro/ Benzema dont get muscled off or have the ball nicked from them? Defenders will always nick it off you every now and again. His shielding is fine, you are just being over critical.

2140~~~
Class again, whenever the ball comes to him you feel he's going to make something happen or at the very lest hold it up well and keep the attack going. He will drift out of games as he holds his position as the tip of the attack, but he's moving constantly and always alert when the ball comes to him.

2141~~~
Just dont burn out and get injured,i can take his form going up and down,think the way how LvG wants his striker to play,he wont look over tired after X months like some other young players.

2142~~~
He oozes class every time he's on the ball <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2143~~~
You just need to give him the ball and he'll do the rest. Class player.

2144~~~
If his shielding is 'fine', he would not have it nicked off him very much at all, no? Re: those strikers - they don't have it nicked off them as much as Martial has done so far. Maybe I am being a little overly-critical, but maybe that tells you just how impressed I've been so far and the level I already expect of him.

2145~~~
BT Sport loved to mention the fact that he's 19 though.

2146~~~
He needs a worthy strike partner that will complement his style of play. With Rooney having the touch of a camel on rollerblades, he's having to do the work of two strikers.

I just hope we don't burn him out (especially considering he's had no pre-season), but he has become such a vital player for us already.

2147~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2148~~~
How long before Martial gets frustrated with the quality of players around him and puts in a transfer request?

2149~~~
I missed that....

2150~~~
Plays with so much experience for a 19 year old, yet he still runs at defenders like a young lad without fear. 

Was never in the game in the second half, first half he was brilliant.

2151~~~
Still missing that CL goal to complete the trio of competitions scored in, but who cares. Looks dangerous, gets past defenders and creates dangerous chances, and retains the ball really well for us.

Can't recall which pundit it was that pointed it out, but at any rate I totally agree with the point that he just seems to know when the conserve energy, and when to spring to life. He's going to become an absolute stone cold killer... in footballing terms, I mean.

2152~~~
I love the fact he's also creating opportunities for others. It seems we've done a good job using Di Maria money on him.

2153~~~
Absolute gem of a player. Now bring in two more wide players capable of playing at the pace he does and watch him net in the goals for fun.

2154~~~
Really enjoyed these. Great wit, RedCafe.

Also I love watching Martial play, I'm still in disbelief most of the time.

2155~~~
Sounds all positive from tonight. Now please just let him score against Arsenal. I'd love to see the headlines after Wenger (more or less) snubbed him.

2156~~~
Is he not already one of our 3 to 5 best players?  Bastian, Mata, Smalling........Martial?

Quite remarkable.

2157~~~
You're missing our best player there. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2158~~~
Tonight after that Rooney miss. It's crazy, but you want to hold back from the Ronaldo ascension comparisons, but feck me he's been so good, it's hard not to.

2159~~~
Can't believe how good he is looking. I echo what the majority say which is how gifted he is on the ball. It seems weird how he is giving us the performances which have been sorely missed recently by marquee signings.

Exciting times to be a united fan with him and a few others alongside.

2160~~~
Playing alongside Mata, Schweinsteiger, Herrera, Memphis, Shaw, Smalling, blind, Darmian, De Gea? There is most definitely not a lack of quality in our squad, not by a long shot. Loads of very promising young players as well. The only issue is Rooney at the moment, because on one hand you hope he can get back to a good level and if so it'll be like a new signing, but if not then he's a problem for us. Our squad quality is very good though.

2161~~~
This kid, barring injury, will be world class someday soon. Extremely gifted. Gooners must be fecking sick as parrots.

2162~~~
Aside from Henry comparisons, he does strike me as an Arsenal-type player. Be lovely if he could rub salt in the wound on Sunday.

2163~~~

2164~~~
He's the best player at the club. That's saying something with Mata, DDG, BFS, Carrick and Rooney around.

2165~~~
Smalling>Martial

2166~~~
It's pretty close isn't it.

2167~~~
Ugh, Martial Martial Martial.

2168~~~
Another missed assist today, no thanks to Rooney. But quite amazing how he just skinned their defender effortlessly before that.

It's clear that he's already a marked man though, hope he gets more protection from referees.

2169~~~
His ability to glide past players so easily reminds me of a young Ronaldo (without the insane trickery). The Brazilian version. Not that I think he is or will be half as good as perhaps the best striker of all time, I just enjoy it when players carry a similar playing style as the legendary R9.

2170~~~
I was thinking the same thing earlier - The Original Ronaldo without the tricks, but with all the strength and tenacity

2171~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Cracked me up. Thank you.
I get what you mean. I haven't kept tracked of the defenders (baseless assumption they are experienced defenders) that have done that to him but he has been put off-balanced a few times. Physically he looks strong for a 19, so I really have to put it down to inexperience for the time being. One of his first moment for United was in a tussle for the ball with a Liverpool player (Can?) and he showed his strength. Can't expect a 19yr old to know every art/trick of the trade.

2172~~~
He's only getting started...<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Needs a better strike partner though

2173~~~
As long as we don't make him angry and confused it should be o.k.

2174~~~
It must be frustrating for him to play with Rooney. Get in Herrera and we shall be potent up front

2175~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2176~~~
The best dribbler we've had since skinny wing Ronaldo or that 18 month period Nani was great.

2177~~~
I can not wait till his individual performance is uploaded on YouTube, since I missed the game.  Anyway, I m looking forward to when he gets a better partner playing alongside him in the future. Perhaps Mata, Wilson or Januzaj from our current players could be an ideal partnership.

2178~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1dk7qPa9rGw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2179~~~
This boy has talent.

2180~~~
One of the first names on the team sheet as far as I'm concerned. He's a joy to watch at full gallop.

2181~~~
He is ice cool. Hardly any hint of fear when he plays.

2182~~~
Read between the lines...I dont think that comment is necessarily about the quality of our squad.

2183~~~
I get shudders when I think where our attack would be without the lad.  We hit the fecking lottery with him, didn't we?  Don't care what anyone says, nobody thought he'd be this good so soon.

2184~~~
Who would you recommend?

2185~~~
I only caught 20 minutes of the match and had not yet seen any highlights of him, he was immediately impressive.  Everything from touch, to composure and skill nevermind his relentlessness.  Haven't seen what sort of two way player he is in terms of tracking back or winning balls back but looks a very quality player

2186~~~
Never stops boggling my mind. The music... are they chosen randomly or whatever's free online?

2187~~~
KdB would have been sensational I think. Anyone else of a similar quality? Griezmann maybe

2188~~~
You need to constantly remind yourself that he is 19. 

He just generates excitement when he has the ball.

2189~~~
Griezmann is the perfect fit. His speed to beat the offside trap from the no.10 position and ice-cool finishing will complement Martial's hold up game seamlessly.

2190~~~
Great find just need another player ala Bale to play around him. We'd be scary we are very close to becoming a top team again.

2191~~~
Another gem please..not a galatico that doesnt want to be here...after Herrera, Darmian and Martial I now trust the scouting team to find just that.

2192~~~
Owen Hargreaves reminded us aplenty.

But, yeah, he's really very, very good. Last night was quite possibly my favourite game of his due to the quality of the opposition we faced.

This was no Ipswich or Sunderland, games in which you'd expect us to dominate. Wolfsburg are a good side and he gave their back line a bit of a hiding. On another night he'd have an assist and possibly a goal to his name.

2193~~~
... Top quality?

2194~~~
We hit the jackpot, boys! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2195~~~

2196~~~
It's hard to not get too excited right. I tend to give young players a season of bedding in and growing into consistency before being confident that they could be a mainstay, but man he just looks like the real deal it's hard not to get carried away.

2197~~~
Must be a good contest in training. Hopefully we never have to see it in club football <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

2198~~~
The kid is special, absolutelynodoubtaboutthat! 
Imagine a world where he played week-in, week-out with a forward passing, attack-minded, energy-laden number 10!

Fast, strong, clever.... Hard to keep a lid on it cause he's only 19.... But what a player so far!

2199~~~
His ability to control the ball inside the box with two, three players around him is unreal. Also whenever he gets the ball close to, but outside, the box he moves inside in a jiffy and suddenly the defender can no longer risk tackling him. Add that to his steely composure and I'm having a very, very hard time not getting super hyped about this kid. Sensational.

2200~~~
This is all thanks to the iPads people, don't forget that.

2201~~~
He's fecking unreal <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Fast becoming one of my favorite players, alongside Smalling, BFS, Darmian, Herrera, Shaw, Mata, Blind, DDG, Carrick...etc...actually that list is becoming increasingly long. We have a ton of good guys in our team, who happen to be excellent at football as well these days.

I was initially worried about the price, but it seems we might have gotten ourselves a bargain! (way too early to say though, i know!).

2202~~~
I love how he's the Caf' dream of a number 9. We've all wanted Benzema for I don't know how long, and appreciated Welbeck' contributions even if he couldn't score. Feels like we deserve to have finally found this gem of a player.

2203~~~
So... do people still think he's 'raw'?

I hate it when people describe a player that way. Particularly when it isn't true. It's such a lazy way to try and make yourself sound intelligent.

2204~~~
Yay. Griezmann or Reus next season to play that number 10. role, and hopefully Depay starting playing good and we'll have as good as attack as any.

Martial has been very different on what I expected. He looks more like a 29 years old player than a 19 years old player. Fantastic composure and mentality, in addition to his undoubted talent.

2205~~~
I always thought "raw" is an attribute of a player who tends to lose ball because of bad decision making or poor touch (Memphis comes to mind actually). I wouldn't say he's raw, he seems to be consistent with his ball control. He's good enough to play every game for us on current form, that's for sure.

2206~~~
He looks ready to be honest, nothing seems to phase him. Only thing i would worry is about burn out, he will need to have a rest eventually. Problem is we have no other striker like him and we would be pretty toothless when he doesn't play.

2207~~~
He's raw in the same way that a rare cooked sirloin steak is raw.

2208~~~
People use that word to make it look as though they're clever enough to 'see' potential. In actual fact, they're just hedging their bets by pinning the responsibility on the player to improve. It's a meaningless phrase.

2209~~~
The thing I find bizarre is that us average joe fans had barely heard of him. Was it just assumed that he was looking good because of the standard of Ligue 1 and that he's surprised a lot of people by stepping up a level against better opposition?

2210~~~
It's all about the trajectory of his improvement. He's turned a corner in the last 12 months and kicked one from being one of dozens of highly rated young players into one of the most promising around. When that happens in a short space of time then it's easy to catch "average joe fans" by surprise. I'm a "lower than average joe" myself at this sort of thing as I only watch PL/CL football and don't play the Football Manager game. I prefer it that way. There's enough young players to keep on top of at our own team, never mind scouting the whole of fecking Europe.

2211~~~
I definitely don't scout young talent like I used to. As you say it's probably a Football Manager thing (specifically unearthing wonderkids) but I think as much as anything its an age thing, or at least just spending the last 15 years following football online, you soon realise 99% of the players hyped at a young age don't live up to the hype and there's little point in following them.

I can remember one article though, I think on F365, that had a list of "Wonderkids" and one of them was Messi. Under the "Who is he?" bit they said he's the reason Barcelona will likely cash in on Ronaldinho soon, he's <b>that </b>talented." or along those lines. I remember scoffing at it and thinking there's no way you let a once in a generation talent like Ronaldinho go because you have a good youngster coming through.

I'm going to dig out the article now...

2212~~~
His piece of footwork followed by his left footed strike that went just past the top corner was lovely. Some goal that would have been.

As for armchair scouting - I'm no average joe, I'm th best armchair scout in the world! Jokes aside, with me, if a player catches my attention I may start following, usually to see he's the real deal or not. Sometimes a player's style or story just touches me too so you form early attachments and always try to 'check in'.

I first saw Martial at th Emirates last season, and he immediately caught my eye. I just tried to keep an eye out here and there after that. My proudest scouting job was Thiago Alcantara though. First saw him playing for Barca youth teams in the #10 shirt while I was looking for clips on Iago Falque and Gai Assulin, who had been linked in random articles. Followed him ever since, so when we were 'close' to signing him - I was a sad man in the UK who felt proud as if he were one of my own.

2213~~~
Interestingly it seems that he was held back by a certain Mr Falcao. Ranieri was quizzed critically by the press when he subbed off Falcao for Martial. I think Monaco's biggest ever signing gave him much less chance at getting minutes at the typical 'wonderkid' age.

2214~~~
Interesting thought. I think you make a valid point although I never took it that way. To me it means “there is a lot of aspects in his game that he has to improve” to become a good player. That’s how I would refer to Memphis. As for Martial, he does the wrong decision from time to time but I’m 100% sure he will be a star in one or two years (that’s because I don’t expect him to continue playing in such form, there will be dips obviously). I’d call Depay “raw” because I don’t have that certainty, so I guess that proves your point.

2215~~~
Was linked to Barca just a few weeks before joining us , and from these comments its evident that they were looking at him

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/barcelona-chief-praises-manchester-united-signing-anthony-martial-amid-reports-they-were-chasing-him-1518489" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/barcelona-...al-amid-reports-they-were-chasing-him-1518489</a>

Also linked with Spurs and Wenger's comments seem to suggest that he was interested. So its likely he was a known commodity amongst the top club's scouts, and United just moved ahead of everyone else for him.

2216~~~
Another good performance last night, we've got a very good player on our hands.

2217~~~
I feel you, I followed Barcelona because of him, before that I couldn't care less about them.

2218~~~
I think it is simple rhetoric more often than not really. Mere lazy cliché. If a player is young, everything he does well is a testimony to his great 'potential', and his mistakes are due to 'rawness' or 'inexperience'. If a player is older, his positives are down to his 'experience'.

Ryan Giggs, for example, still regularly gave the ball away with stupid attempts at back-heels and flicks up until he retired. These things are typical 'inexperience', excpt he's 40, so we can't call it that.

Martial won't be considered the best player or striker in the league regardless of what he does this season. It's likely he will only be considered the 'most promising'.

2219~~~
I missed the first half yesterday and just saw the highlights. The feck was Dante up to when Martial skipped past him in the first half? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2220~~~
Catalogue boy not impressed by Martial

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.teamtalk.com/news/michael-owen-martial-not-taking-my-breath-away" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.teamtalk.com/news/michael-owen-martial-not-taking-my-breath-away</a>

<b>Michael Owen says Anthony Martial has “done what he had to” but not ‘taken his breath away’ with his performances for Manchester United so far.</b>

United paid an initial £36million to sign Martial from Monaco on transfer deadline day, but the 19-year-old has responded to raised eyebrows about his transfer fee with four goals already for the Red Devils.

Owen, however, is not getting carried away about the Frenchman’s performances.

“He has done what he had to do, that was the question mark before he came because he didn’t have a goalscoring record,” Owen said.

“I am not watching him and he is doing things I haven’t seen before, he’s not taking my breath away but you can’t pick any holes in his game right now, he has scored four in four.”

2221~~~
Not even Louis van Gaal who said when he signed him it's for his successor and even recently that Martial's ability to create for other players has surprised him.

2222~~~
Michael Owen is a twat. A boring twat to boot.

This is the same guy who never forgets to sing Rooney's praises, even when he has zero impact on a game.

2223~~~
'He's not even handed round a promotional leaflet or anything.'

2224~~~
That's kind of the ironic point I was making...

2225~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2226~~~
Owen <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

He's a parody of himself now.

2227~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Nice.

2228~~~
I really hate that Scouse bastard. An absolute travesty that he pulled on our great shirt.

2229~~~
This kid will go far.

2230~~~
He's no Michael Owen, lets just leave it at that.

2231~~~
Michael Owen can go feck himself with his "might as well if got it from a packet of cornflakes" league winners medal.

2232~~~
Owen in not-recognising-a-striker's-abilities-beyond-scoring-goals shocker.

2233~~~
That first half, Jesus, he was doing what he wanted with their defenders, his footwork is amazing.

2234~~~
He looks so relaxed whatever he is doing. Against Southampton there was a run against their fullback in which the fullback was sprinting his socks off, and I thought "run you lazy fecker" but Martial just glided away from him without breaking a sweat. Amazing physique. Also, not speaking English seems like a big plus as he shuts his trap and gets on with playing football.

2235~~~
Rooney isn't good enough to be playing alongside this guy. which is rather sad to see from Rooney's perspective, but amazing to see from Martial's.

2236~~~
His reactions are the best. He gets fouled, fouls, scores, creates or whatever really he just has this dead pan expression. It's kinda funny. Dante got into his face last night after a foul and he didn't bat an eyelid. His temperament along with his not so obvious strength are major assets. Not to mention his actual technical ability.

2237~~~
That was absolutely hilarious.

Dante was going fecking mental and shouting at the referee and throwing the ball around, and Marital just got up with a blank expression on his face walked to his position for the free-kick.

A nice contrast to Costa who would have probably poked Dante's eyes out and slapped him a bit.

2238~~~
Nothing what's said here makes sense.., what does he expect Martial to do? He isn't going to reinvent football but you can clearly see his talent and if Owen can't see that he needs to stop watching and commentating on football and focus on his horse-business.

2239~~~
I never understood that either. He should have been remembered as the eternal loser like his mates Carragher and Gerrard. It such a shame that SAF allowed him to join us.

2240~~~
That's what I wanted to say but you've put it perfectly. 

One thing I absolutely love about Martial is when he turns and gets a player 1-on-1 - If he doesn't skin him it comes as more of a surprise. He's an edge of your seat player and I'm looking forward to watching him develop for us.

2241~~~
Sometimes his eyes narrow and I'm convinced he's going to sneeze because no other part of his face moves.

2242~~~
Any luck in finding this article?

2243~~~
Its just insane how dependent we are on him right now. Without him, our attack looks slow and plain. I have never seen a player of his age come to a new country/league and have such an impact.

He's not the next anyone, just the first Anthony Martial.

2244~~~
Bale would be a dream signing for me, we need a player to knock us up one more notch and we'd be there, and what better than a top right-mid. Who else is there than Bale though? Genuine question.

2245~~~
Agree, proper forward thinking player, I reckon fergie would've loved him. Can't stand it when one of our players get the ball and turn around to play it back, Martial seems to love intimidating their defence and constantly going at them. Would say Herrera and Depay are our only other proper forward thinking players.

2246~~~
<span style="color: #ffffff">.</span>

2247~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2248~~~
His inclusion into the squad has transformed our attack in ways that I'll admit that I didn't think was possible for a boy coming in at 19 with no EPL experience.  His quickness, speed, dribbling and finishing are very much needed and his passing has been a nice surprise as well.   I hope this kid keeps playing the way he is now.  ATTACK!

2249~~~
The first two times I'm talking specifically about talent. The third time I'm saying that 'raw' is a pointless term, which is basically what I've been saying all along.

I never actually called anybody 'raw' as a personal description. It's meaningless.

2250~~~
Just to illustrate his impact, something I posted in the LVG thread. 

I think the difference from earlier in the season is Martial. Before we got him, we were scoring an average of 1.66 goals per game (10 in 6, which includes 7 goals against Brugge.) Since then it's 2.5 (15 in 6) against much tougher opposition, while also creating more chances. Small sample sizes obviously but still a clear difference IMO.

2251~~~
Good recovery Dante, Muffled's post is no longer in any way a hilarious put-down.

2252~~~
Greatly appreciated. The kid is diffinetly a talent. I would hope we can manage him to become one of the world's best.

2253~~~
I just realised that Martial actually does have sly eyes like demon

2254~~~
Griezmann, who has a buyout clause and would an amount similar to KDB, and he is also a United fan.

Bale has said it a thousand times that he doesnt want to leave. Even his agent who you'd expect to do the same keeps on saying that. He aint coming here.

2255~~~
Burn

2256~~~
Nah.

Every single teenager in history has been 'raw'. But not every teenager in history has had raw talent. They're two different things. I'm standing by what I said. The last post MF quoted actually backs me up. Most of the other instances are me complaining about people who use the word! (I think one of those is something I posted in the 'little things that annoy you' thread, ffs.)

Saying a teenager is 'raw' is completely redundant. It's as silly as saying that a teenager needs to 'bulk up'. They're nothing phrases that don't mean anything. They only serve to make the poster sound like they're offering an insight when they're not.

2257~~~
That was really said in passing..just reminded me of one which Pexbo did with Dumbstar by quoting something completely contradictory to what he said once..No worries.

2258~~~
Dante got burnt badder than a raw talented fish on a stove! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2259~~~
Too much raw comedy in this thread <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2260~~~
What Martial has done so far in his United isn't extraordinary.....if he was a 25 year old. So in some respect Owen has a point.

But doing it at 19, in a new team, in a new country, with the burden of a huge price tag and the extra expectations that come along with that? That's extraordinary.

He's not only scored and assisted goals, but he's also given some attacking impetus to a team that badly needed it, he's displaced Rooney, and generally looks like he's been a striker for a top club for years. You can sense the confidence boost he has given the team already, and that is why what he's done is breath-taking. So no, his general performances haven't been out of this world, if you ignore the wider context, but ignoring these additional factors is foolish. If he performs in the exact same way 2 or 3 years down the line, Owen would have a point, but not now.

2261~~~

so got you there!

2262~~~
Was going to say that! I'd love to see his Rooney thoughts in comparison!

How anyone can't see that one is plodding, look unfit and barely impacts the game, and one has completely revitalised our attack I don't know.

2263~~~
I'm wasted on you idiots. It's almost as though you can't see I'm the best poster on this site.

2264~~~
You definitely have the raw potential to be the best but you are still a bit raw, patience.

2265~~~
If it's any consolation I'm with you on this.

2266~~~
Really? How so?  Not that I don't believe you but is always good to have players who want to play for us regardless of money offered.

2267~~~
What a miserable and boring bastard Owen is....can't believe he was number 7 at United.

2268~~~
Him and his brother are United fans..dont know the twitter handle of his brother but someone here probably does, I heard about this before he was this good though..Yes, those are the kind of players we need..the ADM thing burnt our fingers, we should learn from that.

2269~~~
He's scoring in a team using LVG philosophy something that RVP, Rooney, Hernandez and Falcao had struggled. That despite moving in a new country, at age 19. I find his ability to immediately take ownership of the forward line by scoring and creating some magnificent goals as impressive.

Its funny because if SAF used the same yardstick with Owen as he's using with Martial than we would have never signed him. The man was a wreck, who was living on his reputation and was largely useless to us

2270~~~
Sad part is he has to link up with  a dud like wazza. Imagine a #10 on his wavelength and level of play.

2271~~~

Anyone seen this yet? Quotes from the Monaco President about how another team offered an even better deal for Martial, but he really wanted to come to United. I'm liking this kid even more! Wonder who the other team were.

2273~~~
He would be ideal, someone who can play anywhere across the front 4 so can effectively be cover to everyone whilst still nailing down a regular starting spot.

2274~~~
chelsea matched our offer and i think psg were the ones who beat it and were prepared to loan him back.

2275~~~
If true, it does say something about him. He could have got an easier ride in Ligue 1, familiar culture and language, closer to family, but chose to follow his dream to Manchester. Nice.

2276~~~
Just saw that too. Encouraging quotes.

2277~~~
It would surprise me a little if a French footballer had an actual dream of playing for Manchester United. We've only had what Evra and Cantona as significant French players? And even then I didn't think France fans particularly like Evra. Does United really have a strong presence in the area

2278~~~

2279~~~
Yes they do. They are as big as Barcelona or Madrid in France.

2280~~~
Arsenal are huge in France, so I imaging the PL gets a lot of exposure there.

2281~~~
That surprises me a bit too. I get France hasn't really had any giant clubs the size of Barca, Bayern, United, etc but surely the league is good enough on its own that people don't feel the need to support an English team.

2282~~~
I heard Rugby was the biggest sport in France up until the '98 World Cup. It might still be in a lot of ways.

2283~~~
I can imagine the leagues decline in recent years shifted domestic interest away, particularly as the majority of their top players moved abroad.

2284~~~
Yup. Last year saw some of the better players in L1 make moves to respectable BPL clubs - Ayew, Payet, Martial etc. I'd imagine the exposure in France would only increase

2285~~~
I think it's Chelsea. They were linked with him too, weren't they

2286~~~
An interchangeable front 4 with pace and technique, yes please !

I also feel that Griezmann can get much better than his current level. Much much better. After the Rooney, Falcao and Rvp front 3 of last season,we deserve that.

2287~~~
PL is shown quite extensively on Canal + (6 games each weekend), with a show dedicated to all the highlights, there's a certain level of exposure. Arsenal used to be the French media and fans darling, but that's changed somewhat. I'd say people that follow English football over here support Arsenal, Utd and Liverpool evenly. 
In what ways would that be? Except in the South West of France, where rugby is bigger culturally speaking, France is quite easily the first sport in France.

2288~~~

2289~~~
Can't argue with that.

2290~~~
Very strong words from Redknapp. I suppose he doesn't always talk shite.

2291~~~
But Michael Owen is not impressed

2292~~~
Like Rooney in Paris said, it's only true and still true in the south west and Languedoc.

2293~~~
Won't read much into it. It's unlikely that Redknaap is informed enough to say this. Most likely a case of him jumping on the hype train.

2294~~~
Neymar. But, not far off.

2295~~~
Redknapp has probably never heard of him a few months ago and now he's calling him the best 19 year old since Messi. Just a bit OTT there.

2296~~~
So Martial turned down bigger offers, huh?

How many clubs are there who can match that outlay?

It has to be Chelsea and PSG.

Perhaps he figured that United would give him the best chance of playing regularly while at a higher salary.

If we hadn't sold Welbeck, Chicharito and RVP, would Martial be here now?

2297~~~
he should watch him in the warm up fully stretching his hamstring

2298~~~
Honestly from watching him, I can't argue with that. Martial plays with such maturity and intellignence, and just looks like a world class player in his prime already despite only being 19. Of the past 10-15 years, I don't remember a teenager other then Messi and maybe Rooney looking as good as he does.

2299~~~
He played for Les Ulis the same under age club as Henry and Evra and was given a pair of boots which Evra gave to the club president while he was playing for United so its not impossible

2300~~~
Wouldn't rank him above Mario Gotze  just yet to be honest (purely post Messi era, otherwise you'd have to include the likes of Cesc aswell).  Easy to forget now, but there was a time when Gotze was being talked of as arguably the biggest German talent since Matthaus. Played a big role in 2 consecutive Bundesliga titles, best player in the 2009 U17 European Championship, Bundesliga team of the season, 'Golden Boy', performed really well vs Brazil in a highly scrutinized match - Gotze vs Neymar for the best teenager in football, and so forth. Martial's body of work at United is impressive, but too condensed to be making such proclamations. Then again, it's Redknapp, and the Sky hype machine. Doubt he's watched Gotze at 18 or 19.

Although, like Gotze, Martial seems almost chillingly mature and intelligent for his age, like a  frost wolf, something that <a class="username" data-user="61592, @bosnian_red" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/61592/">@bosnian_red</a> mentioned previously. Could be a treat to watch over the years. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2301~~~
How do you play France?

2302~~~
By using a hand when you're not supposed to <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

2303~~~
Everyone's getting a bit carried away. He's playing extremely well <i>now</i>, but you can't really start saying 'best 19-year-old since Messi' until he's been doing it for a year. I'm not even sure I would pick Martial over Shaw at the moment in terms of how good they are compared to other players of a similar age in their position.

Let's just enjoy it rather than going straight for the sweeping declarations.

2304~~~
What an absolute gimp <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2305~~~
This guy seems like a brilliant prospect and I'm delighted that we signed him but how were there no big long running links with all the top clubs like a young Hazard or a young Aguero. Wenger reportedly had the chance to sign him but turned him down. (That had to be a money reason)

2306~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Ffs, alcohol at lunch...

2307~~~
But he's not <i>literally </i>the best young player so Jamie doesn't really mean it.

2308~~~
Who knew Evra was going to be as big a fan of us before he came here.same can be said of Cantona. You just never know.

I would assume Arsenal had a lot of fans in the early 2000's cos of the strong French presence in their team at the time. But Martial was 8 when Arsenal last won a league title. His first real premier league idols would probably have been the Rooney/Ronaldos or something like that.

2309~~~
Martial is already superior to Gotze, from a sheer talent perspective... he will prove that with ease in my opinion.

2310~~~
He is a mature player but so is Luke Shaw. I think we should slow the hype machine down a little.

2311~~~
He was linked with Barca, just because the English media didnt print stories doesnt mean he wasnt..I even posted the article where a senior Barca official was talking about him , in this very thread..He didnt just come out of thin air..He was a known commodity, with the Monaco chairman even saying another club offered a higher fixed amount than we did, and an offer for Martial to stay at Monaco for another year, you dont do that for mere punts, but quality...this is a proper talent, and was moving to a big club probably next year. He only moved this year because we were willing to force Monaco's hand.

2312~~~
Not sure I agree with this mate. Without delving into abstract arguments about what constitutes talent, Martial is not superior to what Gotze was at 19, 20 year old. I think people are getting carried away a bit here, and Gotze's time at Bayern is coloring their judgement in terms of how special he was as a youngster at Dortmund. Let's wait and see what level Martial performs at for a season or two, like Gotze did for Dortmund before making such claims. Obviously, I'm not going to name the posters, but done dredging up some posts from Gotze's thread circa 2011/ 2012; and the sentiments are kind of self-explanatory :





Gotze was arguably the biggest talent in a sub-generation that included Neymar, Isco, Hazard, Thiago, Munain, Eriksen and so forth. Martial is awesome, but let's pump the brakes a bit. He might prove to be better in the long run, but a lot of times, those things don't boil down to pure talent. Gotze's development has been stunted somewhat by external factors that wren't all under his control - ranging from niggling fitness issues, to some minor shenanigans, apparent lack of razor sharp focus, and the label of being the most talented German since Matthaus.

2313~~~
Look at that fecking smile.

2314~~~
Am I the only one seeing the sadness in his eyes?

2315~~~
Wonder what club he turned down for us. PSG?

I really hope his dream is to walk in the footsteps of his fellow countryman Cantona. Could not bare to see him off to Spain.

2316~~~
He reminds me of Bitch-Stewie:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://familyguytips.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/wpid-wp-1415924569699.jpeg?w=474" src="https://familyguytips.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/wpid-wp-1415924569699.jpeg?w=474"/>

2317~~~
Seems I was totally wrong on this one. Hardly surprising as I had only seen him twice before when arsenal played monaco. But he really looks the works. There are some chinks in his armour, his off the ball movement in terms of being a direct goal threat isn't there yet. He doesn't look for his own shot enough and hasn't shown anything from range yet but everything seems to be there. Very impressive by him so far.

2318~~~
Probably Chelsea. But, I would not put it past PsG to make such an adacious move for a player we showed interest to. Even though, I question the price tag before, I am glad we were more assertive in our pursuit and not back of the same way we did with Moura or Hazard.

2319~~~
He might be right, but after 4 starts? Come on.

2320~~~
How is Jamie Redknapp one of the foremost football pundits in a country of 64 million people? Seriously, how?

2321~~~
Because very few people with intelligence seriously aspire to be football pundits would be my guess.

2322~~~
Then they are not intelligent, because it's a well paid job.

2323~~~

Well done, Tony!

2324~~~
IIRC there was a times article a day or two after we signed him saying something similar that most people tried to write off as nonsense

2325~~~
It feels good to have a striker that genuinely strikes fear into the opposition defenders and gets you excited before and during the game. I think Utd have lacked this player for quite some time now and Martial has almost instantly brought this fear factor back.

2326~~~
Probably our best again so far?

2327~~~
Biggest threat out there. He's actually matching Mertesacker for strength which is extraordinary. He really need Memphis' pace today though otherwise he'll get too isolated up there.

2328~~~
I remember Robin Van Persie against us in that 8-2 game and everyone thought "he's to good for this shite."

Martial is out Van Persie in this game. I just look at him and think "they've let you down here, lad."

2329~~~
Probably. It seems like he tries to play at a high tempo at parts but you've got players around him slowing it down, we really need someone to compliment his style.

2330~~~
The only acceptable performance out there.

Love this guy

2331~~~
He's been brilliant again.

2332~~~
Pretty much. He's younger than Memphis and looks a completely different calibre of player.

2333~~~
He's the one bright spot. He looks great. His play for his chance was outstanding.

2334~~~
That turn deserved a goal.

2335~~~
Our only bright spot in the half.

2336~~~
shame he was denied by great instinctive save by Cech, next time I am sure he will score from tis situation. Could have been 3:1 before half time and game on... 3:0 is not that bad after what we've seen tbh..

2337~~~
Even when we are losing 3-0 to Arsenal he still finds a way to put a smile on my face. God bless the boy.

If we ever get back into this game it's going to be because of him.

2338~~~
The only risk now is that the stink off Rooney & Memphis rubs off on him.

2339~~~
He really needs someone up there with him. Rooney is just atrocious. Depay looks like he couldn't give a shite. Would love to see Herrera at 10 behind him.

2340~~~
He's awesome.

2341~~~
He is fecking amazing.

2342~~~
Wouldn't say he was amazing in this game. Had he been better United would have been in the game. Got two great chances to score but missed both.

2343~~~
He certainly should have scored one alright. But he's still been our best player.

2344~~~
The only positive from the game.

2345~~~
This guy's great.

2346~~~
Very good I felt sorry for him tbh. Only positivity came through him.

2347~~~
He can't do it all himself. Not every game anyway.

2348~~~
What a gem, the only positive in this game.

2349~~~
He played well again, pretty much our only real threat for 80 minutes both wide and centrally, was unlucky not to grab a goal. You'd honestly think he was 21 and Memphis was 19 when you look at the difference in the maturity oi their games.

2350~~~
Thought he did very well. He is showing that he cannot be handled by getting tight on him. You are going to see defenders back off him more often which should open up shooting opportunities and chances to go past defenders.

2351~~~
What I liked was that he continued to play his game, pinning defenders with his strength in the middle and peeling off into the channels to use his pace. Unlike Rooney of the Rovers.

2352~~~
With Smalling the only bright spot today. Could still have done better but the fecker is only 19 and we already are dependent on him going forward with the likes of Rooney being done and Depay not performing.

2353~~~
The only player who was good today

2354~~~
Wut?

First chance he created out of nothing and it was very difficult to score from turn and his shot was actually very good but was saved. 

What was the second, my brain has stuck at the moment?

2355~~~
Was our best player along with Rooney. Love how effortlessly he goes past players, he's definitely a proper future world class player. You can just tell his quality. Should have scored mind you, but he did brilliantly to create the chance in the first place. The way he's played now, ignoring his age... you'd have to say that only Aguero is ahead of him as the best strikers in the league. He's brilliant.

2356~~~
Once again looking a step above his teammates at 19 years old in a new team. He's going to be great for us and will fire us to a league winning campaign eventually.

2357~~~
Another promising performance, let down by the team.

2359~~~
I was actually disappointed by his shot. He could have hit that cleaner, and he also had more time than he realised. But we can't be too harsh on him for that - he created the chance out of nothing and was the only positive point from today's performance.

2360~~~
He did very well for that chance, most strikers wouldn't have been able to control that pass and turn to shoot, and his shot wasn't straight at Cech he at least was trying to put it into the corner. It's just a shame he doesn't have someone else up top with him playing to a decent standard to help him more.

2361~~~
i am a bit sad. he needs to have a worldie of a season for us to have any chance at challenging. We need reinforcements in January.

easy us saying that though. He didn't know the defender was on his arse after the great turn

2364~~~
A perfect summary of our slow play.

2365~~~
Amazing player. He stood out even in a crap performance. He plays with a maturity far beyond his years.

Shame we provided no support to him whatsoever.

2366~~~
Yeah, our best player by a mile.

2367~~~
Agree with most the positivity in here. Just a shame he didn't finish that chance before half time. That could have changed everything.

2368~~~
It was actually a good finish, but unfortunately an even better save. I thought he was mostly great in what he did today. His pace really is something, even if he doesn't look fast always he just glides away from people. He even made Bellerin look stationary today. He is also so strong in his hold-up play that it is quite something for a 19 year old lad. 

Watching him playing so well at such a young age gives me hope that Wilson can replicate some of that play.

2369~~~
The only one out there possibly who can come out of this with their head held high. He tried his best to get us back into it but it just wasn't meant to be.

2370~~~
Hype getting a bit out of hand I see. He really wasn't very good today. Which doesn't matter.

2371~~~
He makes great runs too - Herrera will feed him through balls all day long

2372~~~
He made out only real chance all on his own. Made numerours good runs. And the biggest compliment I can pay him is, throughout the whole match I thought if anyone was going to get us back in the game it was him. 

Scoring isnt everything.

2373~~~
Completely agree although regarding your last point, from the little we've seen of Martial, if there's one thing he could perhaps improve on is that he's a bit too unselfish at this moment. His maturity in playing the game and adjusting to the situations is very assuring as he seems always pick the 'right' choice. He will beat the player for pace and laid it square, he will hold the ball well and lay it off, he won't try to take on 2-3 players in no hope situations (looking at you Memphis) etc. Maybe we can see a bit more forceful threat from himself. E.g in situations where he drops deep/wide and instead of looking for the right pass, become the danger himself and look for the shot (in effect this will open up space for others too).

That's not a slight on him though, he's done everything you can ask of him and then some. A joy to watch.

2374~~~
Our best player in the game, by far. At times he was all alone against the whole Arsenal defence and still made things happen more often than not. 

He's miles ahead of Memphis at the moment in terms of decision making, technique, maturity, attitude and overall impact in the games.

2375~~~
The only positive player, and who can actually pull of his tricks and dribbles is this 19 year old kid, knows exactly how and when to dribble, and get past people, we got a great player on our hands

2376~~~
He was actually pretty decent again I thought amongst a bunch of woeful performers. Made a chance for himself which was well saved and despite being isolated for large periods of play he at least tried to make things happen when he got involved. The future looks good for him.

2377~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/34wOOOpkidg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2378~~~
I thought he made a fair few unforced errors during the game, in the highlights reel I counted 11 times he lost the ball. 

However I thought he was our MOTM and our brightest player. He was trying things and brave enough to keep trying when a previous attempt hadnt worked. He seems to me to have a calmness about him but also a sharp energy as well.  Some of his touches show just how big a future he has.

Still learning how his team mates play, still learning the English language, still getting used to being in England and not France at 19. Still getting used to the EPL.  Hamstrung by a strike partner who is past it.   I would actually like to see him and Wilson get a game together and Rooney on the bench. I think we would see goals.

2379~~~
Management must set the attack around him. Vital to get the very best out of him. He's just so good

2380~~~
I liked what I saw from him today. He was positive in his actions and thinking. My fear is burnout. I think that is part of the issue with Memphis. We have zero backups for his role that are remotely suitable. That includes Rooney. I just hope he doesn't burn out. I agree the attack should revolve around him. He is so dangerous. Ideally I just wish he had a proper partner at #10 or as a strike partner.

2381~~~
Our best player by far during the match. Thought he was really unlucky not to score as Cech pulled off a crazy save. It's amazing how he's done since coming here.

2382~~~
At 5:30 when he goes past Gabriel and cuts it back, why the feck is Rooney not making that near post run until its of no use? At least Fellaini had made a decent far post run. Time to drop Rooney and give Martial either a decent strike partner or a No.10. Wilson or Mata or Herrera.

2383~~~
Comfortably our best player yesterday, the kid is absolute class.

Shame the rest of the team was having an absolute shocker of a performance.

2384~~~
The kid cant save matches on his own. The team needs to support him.

2385~~~
This clip pretty much sums up our attack in this game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2386~~~
Looks to be a level above most of our XI in terms of technique, movement and decision making. Which, considering he is 19, is an indictment on the rest of them.

2387~~~
He's quite simply fantastic. He'll score 25+ this season unless he gets injured. This time next year he'll be world class.

A bit ridiculous how no one brought him up in the summer when there numerous threads on which striker we should sign. He looks a level or two above every one of them.

2388~~~
Not to be hyper critical, but he really should have scored that chance... that's the goal, just before half-time, that gives us any remote chance of getting back into the game.

Still he made the chance himself and everything, and he's generally brilliant... so there you go.

2389~~~
Not to be hyper critical, but you're going to be hyper critical? 

Cech made a monster save, it happens, no blame on Martial. He did brilliantly to even fashion the chance.

2390~~~
He had very little time to shoot before the defender closed down the angle. Cech was very fast rushing forward to close him down though

2391~~~
An indictment of the quality of our so called 'senior' players and 'legends' that we now rely on a 19 year old in his 5th or so game for the club to get us results. He and Mata make up our attack. Disgusting.

2392~~~
Indeed, but then that is generally how people phrase things before doing that exat thing!

And he did do brilliantly to fashion the chance (as said above) he'll have to do brilliantly to create chances for himself in a lot of games for us it seems... he also has to take the chances he creates, and with his standard of finishing he's shown so far, I'd expect him, one on one with the keeper from 8 yards out to score. 

I love the kid, but doesn't mean that he didn't have <b><i>the</i></b> big chance that <b><i>could </i></b>have got us back to the game. We should rightly applaud him for creating it (and we have) but yeah, you would hope next time he bangs that in.

2393~~~
Looked to me as he scuffed the shot a bit (need to see it again though), if he connected a bit better and lifted it half a metre off the ground then thats a goal.

2394~~~
Yeap, He did scuff a little bit but it was down to his balance after he tried to bounce the ball with the right foot and shot it with his left foot. Had it the other way around he would've been able to make a clean shot with a better angle

2395~~~
It was an excellent save. Nothing wrong with the finish. Would have found the corner perfectly. Once Cech got that close and spread himself the opportunity was gone.

2396~~~
Martial did pretty much everything possible to score that, but you have to give Cech props for reading the situation and closing him down very quickly. If he didn't manage to spread his leg out wide it was a goal. Sometimes tough things are just not meant to be, on another day that goes over his foot into the bottom corner, and Schweinsteiger takes a good first touch and dinks it over the keeper. 

At 3-2 we could well have got back into the game, but it was just 1 of those days. 

Apart from that though he looked our only shining light, he goes passed defenders like they aren't even there, and he muscled Mertesacker on more than 1 occasion. I haven't felt excited to watch a united player like this since Pogba in the reserves and Ronaldo/Rooney when they were together.

2397~~~
I love how he never smiles and looks so serious all the time.

2398~~~
Harsh to say he didn't do enough there. He clearly did enough, just Cech did better.

It's a bit concerning that we're <i>demanding</i> a 19 year old who is less than 10 games old at the club, to score those kinds of goals though.

2399~~~
It is. With the way Rooney and Memphis are playing, our season's hopes basically rest on his shoulders.

2400~~~
To be fair, no striker converts every single one of their big chances. Apparently those are usually converted at around 40% (saw this stat somewhere), and he's been scoring all of them but that one pretty much. Did great to make it but was a good save on him.

He's a different level of talent and potential to any of our other youngsters though. Januzaj, memphis, Wilson, pereira are all varying levels of promising and can become top players, but with martial, you can tell he is already an excellent player. Even on an off day, he can still dribble the ball past defenders, hold the ball up and create something out of nothing. He's actually a lot like an aguero, or a Sanchez for us, and he'll only get better. Obviously not at their level quite yet, but he's that difference maker we needed in our team, someone who can suddenly just take everyone on on his own and score a goal. As long as he stays clear of injuries, its obvious he'll become one of the best around. Same with Shaw (sadly he hasn't stayed clear of injuries, so let's hope he recovers well and it doesn't hamper him too much).

2401~~~
You must be awesome at weddings.

2402~~~
Far from hype. He looked like our only chance of ever scoring. A few Arsenal fans I know who watched him for the first time thought he was our only real threat

2403~~~
Well, maybe he was, and I'm not trying to downplay his potential as I've been as impressed and surprised as anyone. But yesterday was not a good game, he conceded possession too many times.

2404~~~
That's not his job, to retain possession. For who? Rooney and Memphis were useless. Mata was ineffective. He was our only functional attacking outlet, and he was a genuine threat both on the wing and through the middle. I'm not giving him a 10, but that's because he was in a team that received a drubbing. On an individual level I found little fault with his performance, and that's if I become a nitpicking bastard.

2405~~~
Watching that game I actually felt sorry for the boy. He often had to face at least 3 defenders in front of him, while his 2 other partners never tried to run to create any space but stood there watching like a couple of morons

2406~~~
Yeah they were doubling up on him whenever he had the ball, they were more worried about him than anyone and he still almost scored a great goal.

2407~~~
He was excellent against Arsenal, created chances out of nothing. I thought and wrote already before his signing that he's already better than our forwards. But he has surpassed my expectations. At this point of time, he is second only to Aguero. Given his age and potential, I wouldn't exchange him for Aguero though.

2408~~~
He's a great player in the making, but it's annoying how the emphasis is on finding players that can "create something out of nothing". The system should be solid enough that such occurences where that magic is needed, are few and far inbetween.

2409~~~
What's also impressive is his demeanor.

He is not petulant at all. When there is a dodgy foul or close offside he simply gets on with it.

On a side note he is a beast in fifa 16. Too fast with tight dribbling and can finish from anywhere.

2410~~~
Very good point really. I hope we don't get to a point where the football will be about giving the ball to Martial and just hoping that he does something special. He is going to get more and more tightly marked.

2411~~~
Got this bit from an interview he did - but this section only I'm afraid. Kid sounds pretty grounded..

<b>Anthony Martial interview </b>
Quote:
“I know this is a very great player who is a legend in England, I do not think we have the same characteristics. Thierry Henry is Thierry Henry. I still have everything to prove. By continuing to work, I will try to reach his level but I am still very far off.”

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Transfer</span>
“Basically, I was told ‘untransferable’ so I thought staying in Monaco,” he said.

“When I knew about the offer, I did not hesitate a second and it was done quickly. I really wanted and I really wanted to continue to play in the Champions League. Van Gaal called me and spoke to my mother who did the translation. When I arrived in Manchester I met him, we discussed at length and it was done quickly.”

<span style="text-decoration: underline">Transfer fee</span>
"It did not bother me too much. It was more my family with all that was written in the newspapers and what was said. I was just in a hurry to go to Manchester and play football.

“I try to ignore it all. I stay in my bubble, I concentrate on the football, I work and I try to learn English as quickly as possible.”

2412~~~
could he be any more perfect?

2413~~~
he's brilliant.

2414~~~
I don't know how much English he can actually speak but from what i've read it would seem he can't speak a word of the language. They don't care for English much in school out there do they? Compared to Scandinavian countries for instance

2415~~~
Yes, it's probably the +100m speakers and almost 30 countries where it's spoken. Scandinavians are great at English out of necessity. 

No, he could not be any more perfect. Well, he could categorically state that he'll never ask to go to Real or Barca.

2416~~~

2417~~~
<b>How was your experience for your first goal for Manchester United against Liverpool?</b>

<i>It really felt good. The fans were with me in my celebration and it was really something great for me. Old Trafford is impressive. The supporters average is 75,000 people, it’s a bit of a change from the little Stade Louis II… </i>

<i>It’s really magical to me. It’s nice that there is in the world. This is what makes footballers want to play all matches. It’s going pretty well for me. I’ve played matches, scored some goals, I am very happy.</i>

<b>Your transfer happened very quickly. What was your experience?</b>

<i>Basically, I was told “untransferable” so I thought I was staying in Monaco. When I knew that this offer came, I did not hesitate a second and it was done quickly. I really wanted the move, and I really wanted to continue to play the Champions League. Van Gaal called me and spoke to my mother who did the translation. When I arrived in Manchester we met, we discussed things at length and it was done quickly.</i>

<b>What was your first impression of Old Trafford?</b>

<i>I’m just warming up and I saw all the fans stand and applaud me. I thought it was really good of them. They did not know me but they showed me a real support. This is what allowed me to be ready quickly.</i>

<b>Were you intent on proving yourself a success on your debut?</b>

<i>For sure, it was very important to show the coach that he could trust me and allow me to play. Going to Manchester, I knew there was Rooney in attack and that he preferred to play No. 10. I told myself that I would get my chance and I had to seize it.</i>

<b>Did you obtained guarantees about playing in a centre forward position?</b>

<i>I knew I would be the second striker.</i>

<b>Does you feel that Louis van Gaal give you more confidence than Leonardo Jardim?</b>

<i>Van Gaal told me to work hard and I would win my place in the team. It is what I did. For now, I’m playing.</i>

<b>There were many comments about the transfer price. Did they weigh on you?</b>

<i>Me? It did not bother me too much. It was more my family, with all that was written in the newspapers and what was said. I was just in a hurry to go to Manchester and play football. </i>

<i>Many people spoke, but I stayed focused. I worked hard to be ready. I have not read any of the newspapers. Since I was little, I never looked at what was said about me. </i>

<b>Is it not too difficult to handle all this pressure at just 19?</b>

<i>I try to ignore it all. I stay in my bubble, I concentrate on the football, I work and I’m trying to learn English as quickly as possible.</i>
<b>
Everybody compares you to Thierry Henry by your gestures and your background. You get inspired?</b>

<i>I know he is a very great player, and he is a legend in England. I do not think we have the same characteristics. Thierry Henry is Thierry Henry is. I still have everything to prove. By continuing to work, I will try to have his level but I am still very far.</i>

2418~~~
He probably speaks a bit of English, if not a lot. I expect him to pick it up quickly though, he seems intelligent and has a great attitude. Plus he's young and surrounded by English, it should happen quite naturally

2419~~~

2420~~~
Good for him, well deserved. 

Who would have thought he'd become one of our most important players when we signed him?

2421~~~
First of many I imagine.

2422~~~
The players playing around him have to step it up. Namely Memphis and Rooney. Not been good enough. It's a bit frustrating because I think he'd even be more amazing if the others around him were playing well.

2423~~~
I imagine there aren't many new signings who become player of the month in their first weeks in a foreign league. Fantastic.

2424~~~
Looks like it..

2425~~~
Your point being? That I was proven wrong? I already wrote that he's surpassed my expectations. But...You didn't quote the posts where I said already before the deal for him that he is better than our current forwards. And that I thought about him as an option already before we enquired about him. I'm glad that he turned to be even better tnan expected. So, what's your point exactly?

2426~~~
Pretty poor form digging up posts from a few months back, when most people on here were having doubts.

2427~~~
What does he mean by "I knew I would be the second striker"?

2428~~~
Rooneywas supposed to be first. But he's shite.

2429~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I notice this as well. I guess that is his thing.

Nevertheless, he deserve player of the month for September.

2430~~~
This is really exciting. To think, we're going to have years of watching this guy.

2431~~~
He just seems really level-headed and mature. He's not going to harp on about his ambitions, but he'll work hard towards them. 
I really really like this guy, as we all do. 

Nothing more exciting than a young, extremely talented forward.

2432~~~
Well deserved player of the month. I just hope he won't play much for France so that he'll be fresh for the Everton match in two weeks.

2433~~~
I love it, walks with a swagger and confidence like "yes I know I am pretty damn good" <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Martial assist for Benzema against Armenia.

Nice vision and invention to play that slight pass. Good stuff.

2436~~~

2437~~~
Sexy that

2438~~~
This boy is a superstar in the making. How did we sign him? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2439~~~
At first I thought he'd just Rooney'd the first touch, but yeah looks like he meant it on second viewing

2440~~~
Fantastic stuff.  This signing was like winning a poker match. High risk, high reward.

2441~~~
Well, we did break the world record fee for a teenager...

2442~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I m glad he is justifying that price tag so far for United.

2443~~~
Can't wait till we get proper attackers around him. Half of our attackers are still asleep this season.

2444~~~
That French team on paper looks scary

2445~~~
I'm pretty sure all bipedal human beings walk like that.

2446~~~
I went the other way. At full speed I thought it was a lovely flick pass but his reaction to chase after the ball then slow down once Benzema had it implied to me it was by accident, since normally you don't make half a run when following a pass, but who the hell knows.

2447~~~
Still possible for Martial to end up starting. Benzema is a great set up man and if Matuidi-Pogba-Cabaye/Schneiderlin can handle the midfield, you could see someone like Valbuena or Payet starting the tournament as the other winger (along with Griezmann) but Martial scoring off the bench in the group and winning the job. A time honoured tradition at international tournaments, really.

2448~~~
He meant it.. I think its fairly obvious.  He chased because he thought Benzema might need support but once he saw he'd gone clean through. . Let him get on with it.

2449~~~
No it's not at all. Ffs you post on a public forum and if you post something that turns out to be rubbish you can expect to have it mentioned again. Might make people think twice.

2450~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.. an adjective now?

2451~~~

He is amazingly consistent. Looked fantastic again from those highlights

2454~~~
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh, you're a one way streeeeeet!!

Why do these morons keep making youtube videos with letterboxes that block half the screen.

Not bad this kid

2458~~~
What Martial can improve is his heading ability. Most often when the GKs kick the ball upfront he misses the header while no defender is close by.

2459~~~
His heading was great whenever I watched him for Monaco.

2460~~~
He glides past defenders so effortlessly, he slows them down and then just accelerates past them, just brilliant.

2461~~~
Just took the time to read the posts from a few days back - I didn't bloody know the kid had won player of the month?? In his first month?! That is insanely great! Can't wait for him to improve even more  - and he's ours<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2462~~~
France have a real young, quality squad <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

2463~~~

2464~~~
Very interesting read that. All clubs worth their salt interested different it's true. Also, the clauses seem different to what was first reported. Or maybe Monaco rate him highly enough to believe those clauses are very likely to be activated.

2465~~~
Good man....

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.co.uk/manchester-united/story/2658271/martial-believes-united-can-win-premier-league-and-ucl" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.co.uk/manchester-...elieves-united-can-win-premier-league-and-ucl</a>

2466~~~
What's great is that that isn't even a full sprint <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> It doesn't look as if he put a lot of effort in pulling away from defenders there. Seems to have gears of speed as a back up. 

I'd love to see how fast he can go.

2467~~~
I've adopted the Martial walk.

2468~~~
Some dude on Twitter says he's starting in the friendly today

2469~~~

2470~~~
How in the feck is Varane captain over Blaise Matuidi, who eats lighting and craps thunder?

2471~~~
How is Sissoko still playing for France? They have quite a few good midfielders. Deschamps has the habit of making some questionable decisions.

2472~~~
it's only a friendly.

Martial, Benzema & Griezzmann as a front three on paper will be brilliant at the euros.

2473~~~
And one assist, one.

2474~~~
Decent through ball to Giroud. Schmeichel should have done way better though.

2475~~~
Clever pass from him.

2476~~~
Yup, he does well on the left.

2477~~~
Incredible Front Trio...

We should do our all to sign Griezmann.

2478~~~
He's just got that quality to make absolute mugs out of defenders. Beautiful to watch.

2479~~~
He's started brightly.

2480~~~
His touch and general play around the box is bloody brilliant.

2481~~~
Where are you watching this?

2482~~~
French TV.

2483~~~
He has been brilliant so far, what a talent.

2484~~~
Ahh Ok thanks, just scanned through the channels and couldn't find it, guess I'm stuck with the Ireland game.

...Just seen his assist on twitter, very nice.

2485~~~
Along with Varane arguably 2 of the 10 biggest talents in world football (even 5 maybe).

2486~~~
It was Spain, then Germany and now it's France who have the best talents around. We should try to get a few of them.

2487~~~
What a sexy little flick through the legs to put Giroud away on the left.

2488~~~
He's been really good for us up top, but i'd love to see us use him as a wide forward on the left, with us getting a striker next season.

2489~~~
What a fecking player

2490~~~
It's where he'd be so dangerous in a fluid front 3, he's got so much variety in his game he'd be such a handful.

2491~~~
With Depay not on form, I'd love to see:

---------- Rooney
Martial - Herrera - Mata

If Rooney wasn't captain, I'd probably give Wilson a go up front just for his pace alone. Or a new striker like you said.

2492~~~
In a fluid front three he could be lethal. Kane would be a good striker.

2493~~~
Assist for Giroud:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/gndi" width="560"></iframe>

2494~~~
I think so too. We could try and replicate the Barca front three. Think he'd bag quite a few goals from that position too.

2495~~~
Id agree actually, I think Kanes build up play and creativity is a little underrated, he's great at bringing others into play.

2496~~~
Yeah, that's why I proposed that's the only reason why I rate him because he is very good during the build up phase.

Regarding Martial, I feel that he is even better than I think, he seems very close from Griezmann.

2497~~~
We should get in the right side of that front 3 as well. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2498~~~
Varane is more of a media darling than Matuidi. Blaise should be the captain period. His consistent performances for club and country should have earned him that honor ahead of Lloris even.
It is a mystery, he is simply a rubbish footballer.

2499~~~
Because when we were struggling, maybe a year before the World Cup, he played very well and kind of "saved" us, so Deschamps is loyal to him.

2500~~~
How long is Ribery injured for? Is he one of those guys who is just not good for the French team like Nasri, or will he come back in the starting xi provided he's fit?

2501~~~
He retired from international football.

2502~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> feck sake I feel silly now. Does make sense why no one has been talking about him

2503~~~
Everytime he got on the ball something exciting was happen, just like his performances for United.

Interesting how good he is at LW, could possibly use Wilson up front with Mata on the Right.

2504~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> I won't blame you, no one cared when he announced it.

2505~~~
He should have mentioned a couple of quotes about LvG. There would have been 10 different threads opened on here and every newspaper would write it with different conclusions. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2506~~~
How was Morgan tonight? I take it you watched the game.

2507~~~
He was good but nothing outstanding, Martial was brilliant though.

2508~~~
Good to hear. I've said it before but I'll say it again, it's really hard to stay grounded with how well Martial plays. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2509~~~
Well since you know a lot France NT, do you think Martial have a chance to be in the first team at EUROs?

2510~~~
He will elevate his game when the other attackers around him step up.

2511~~~
I'm 99% sure that he is in the group for the Euro because Deschamps said that the current 23 players were going to play against Germany and England. As for the first eleven, if we play in 4-3-3 he will start on the left, if we play in 4-4-2 Diamond he won't start.

2512~~~
Think Martial will probably make that left wing his own for France, going into the Euro's. A front three of Martial - Benzema - Griezmann looks frightening.

2513~~~

2517~~~
Even if the only thing LvG achieves as a United manager is to bring through Martial, that'll be enough for me. I'm doubtful we'll win much under van Gaal, but at least we'll be left a star on our hands. He could be the manager's Rioch/Bergkamp legacy.

2518~~~
Impressive performance.

2519~~~
I wonder why they make these videos always feel like watching through a periscope. Sometimes you can't even see the player.

2520~~~
He just feels like a special player.

2521~~~
Wow, that's very impressive. Can't believe he is 19.

2522~~~
With the players we have with huge potential, I really think its set up perfectly for the next manager to come in. We can realistically expect 5 of our u21 players to become world class. With one of them, martial, potentially being the best in the world. Januzaj, Shaw, Pereira and Memphis alongside Martial is perfect for Giggs or whoever else takes over to take us to the top. That's part of the reason I'm confident Giggs will be a success if he takes over. United always give managers time, and Giggs is sure to give the players freedom and attack with pace, but the organisation from Van Gaals tenure will be left over. And with the players we'll have when in a couple of years, it just seems like even if Giggs isn't a great manager, that circumstances will potentially make him have a great Starr with united. 

With some players, you can just see that they'll be among the best in the world. Everyone saw it with Rooney, regardless of how he is now, everyone saw it with Messi, with ronaldo, with hazard, Sanchez, de Gea, aguero, Silva.... Everyone knew these players would be top players. Martial and Shaw are firmly in that group as well IMO.

2523~~~
Amazing talent. He needs to work on his finishing/composure, but that will come with time and hard work. He's got something special. It's rare that I'm this excited about seeing a United player.

2524~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> His composure is one of the (many) things that really stick out about him. He's got amazing composure for someone so young and never seems to rush anything. At a guess, I'd say he could work on his shooting from range or striking the ball with his weaker foot, and maybe heading it, but we haven't seen him really try to do that much, so he might have it in him.

2525~~~
From the little I've seen of him, I get the feeling he'd be best served playing on the left of an interchangeable front three.

Not really an option for us, at the moment, though.

2526~~~
It's great for his age yes, but it's still got a way to go to be great.  His technique, dribbling, agility, speed, passing (inconsistent) etc. is more at the level of the best strikers.

For being a 19 year old you can't expect much more from him, but for being United's number one you would eventually expect him to improve on those aspects of the game that we mentioned.

2527~~~
His overall play and end products has been superior than the rest of our attack. Saying Messi needing to improve on his heading ability is pointless, of course every player needs to improve. Just watch and enjoy, at 19 years old the boy will certainly keep improving.

2528~~~
Our current attack isn't what we should be comparing ourselves too. We gotta compare ourselves to the best in the league. Saying Martial needs to improve his ability to finish well (in many different situations), is not the same as saying Messi needs to improve his heading (which he doesn't have to).

I am watching and enjoying. I just mentioned that in the post before. I can still give some constructive feedback on his play though.

2529~~~
He had some good games on the left for Monaco so no surprise he's played well there for France as well, the versatility is another string to his bow.

2530~~~
He was actually SMILING at 2:59.
Wow.

2531~~~
On a completely unrelated subject, I love France's away kit.

2532~~~
I don't agree with all of this 'we should turn him into a left wonger' talk. He can certainly play there, and even play well there - but if you have a player who can be the best centre-forward in the world, you play him there. It is far more valuable to the team to have one of those.

Goalscorers at the top level are gold.

2533~~~
In a way he is a bit like Suarez, he is a striker that can play on the left but he is pacier than Suarez, so in a fluid attack you don't need to necessarily assign him the middle.

2534~~~
We've got ourselves a very talented striker, the only one in our squad. Let's go on and turn him into a winger.

2535~~~
This is where you make a mistake, it wouldn't make him a typical winger at all. Besides most of his impressive performances have come from playing on the wing and cutting in. He has more space to run and dribble.

2536~~~
Ronaldo, Messi, Robben have showed that you can be as much as a goalscorer and play on the wing (not as a typical winger of course). If the player is good enough, scoring goals and creating havoc won't be a pb wherever he plays.

2537~~~
Yeah, the way he played last night reminded me Hazard, until now I have always see him ending up as a striker but he might be a great inside forward.

2538~~~
It is great that his talent allows him to give the team more possibilities. Wherever he plays, he'll be a constant danger and even more so when he has space to run into.

2539~~~
We don't have a fluid attack though. van Gaal's system is very rigid - it isn't one for interchanging positions. We have no options up front to chuck him on the left anyway.

2540~~~
At the moment, for sure yes. Hopefully in the future, with more talented attackers it'll be a possibility.

2541~~~
We are thinking about the future at the moment we have one player upfront that's Martial, Mata has nothing to do in our front three. So we can dream about who will be ideal to partner him, two wingers or one winger and one striker? 
We should be open to all the options.

2542~~~
I'm not saying they can't all operate from wide, but if a player is of a certain level of influence, you want them where they can do the most damage. Messi could always play wide, but he was moved centrally as he needed to be at the centre of things. Robben is a brilliant winger, but was moved centrally for Netherlands to maximise his influence on the game, as he was their standout talent.

Henry would have still been brilliant if he was made to play from the left, but it was quickly recognised that he was good enough to do it centrally, so it became the logical choice. Daniel Sturridge was often used from the right in his younger days, but it would be a waste to do so now. We are getting to the same turning point for Theo Walcott now. He can play on the right, but his threat is likely to be far more devastating if he can transfer it to the centre. Welbeck, on the other hand, is an average player who will be used in both roles as the team requires, however, if he became prolific, he'd spend his time in the middle.

I think in an ideal world, you want your best attacking player to be fairly central to what you do. Also, top strikers are few and far between. When you have one, you have to play him there I think. I mean caftards have been telling me for years that Rooney has been 'sacrificed' every time he is not central to our attack.

2543~~~
He's got this fantastic body balance that fools so many of his opponents, Giggsy-esque it is.

2544~~~
<a class="username" data-user="69330, @Rozay" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69330/">@Rozay</a>  and the question is where does he make more damages? I've seen him play a lot, Kouroux saw him too and I don't know. At the moment he could be great in both roles, his speed and creativity make him a very good inside forward and his calm and power make him a very good striker.

2545~~~
good reviews for our man in the French press:


<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.francefootball.fr/news/Les-gagnants-et-les-perdants-de-la-semaine/598206" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.francefootball.fr/news/Les-gagnants-et-les-perdants-de-la-semaine/598206</a>


Not far from man of the match in Denmark for his first start for France, the Manchester United man scored points and his presence in the group is (already) almost guaranteed for the next gathering in November. Decisive passer for Benzema against Armenia, Martial was very powerful on the left side against Denmark's Guingampais of Jacobsen, who had a rough time. The former Monaco player could even afford the luxury of missing a goal chance to top it off. And if he as expected faces the  Germans and English to open his account for the Blues?

2546~~~
He missed a chance? How very un-Martial of him.

2547~~~
He created by himself the biggest opportunity that he missed, he was on his left foot and Kasper did a Peter.

2548~~~
He was class yesterday. Such a clever player.

2549~~~
It all depends on the system.  Martial is as much of a striker as he is of a wide attacker and therefore he gives the manager good tactical possibilities. I personally think he's even better player as a wide player than a central striker, in the end where United needs him the most will determine where he'll play.

2550~~~
Always love watching him play. Such an elegant player. Everything he does seems so smooth and he has such a great close control of the ball it's just fantastic to watch.

2551~~~
Moving Martial to the wing is a nice discussion to have, but who should we play as no.9 then? Rooney again?? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2552~~~
I hope not. I think Martial actually got all the tools to be an amazing number 9. He got the physical strength, can hold up a ball and lay it off. He drift wide if there is no space in the center and play a smart cross or pass, or come deep to get involved in the build up and on top of that his finishing has been amazing so far. I'd rather we go for someone like Griezmann or Reus or even both if we need to improve our wide options.

2553~~~
Of course that's not a worry now.  If/when we do buy a good no. 9, Martial and he should interchange positions often.  As such, Martial appears to be a very good no. 9, but I think he's better off cutting inside from the left at times.

2554~~~
It'll be available for cheap soon enough cause they'll have new ones.

2555~~~
I think for France this is a good solution as they have a world class number 9 1/2 with Benzema who is ideal for a one striker system but we simply haven't got this kind of player and I don't know which option would be available in the near future. On the other hand I feel there are some players in the wide areas that would offer what we need and don't play for anyone of the 3 giants or City right now, which means they should be getable for us.

2556~~~
If we buy a good no.9, he should play alongside Martial to support each other as I believe in a 2 strikers system more than a lone striker one. This no.9 person hopefully can also play as no.10 if require to against opponent with powerful central midfield (aka. Rooney 6 years ago)

I like these 02 guys that you mentioned, but they are a little bit over-hyped which will cost us a lot of money. I prefer Mane who is EPL proven, similar to Martial in a lot of ways that they both should compliment each other instead of competing (explosive pace, nice passing and shooting, can operate on their own in the wing, good positional sense etc,). They would form a beastly partnership even more dangerous than the Cole-Yorke pair

2557~~~
My bro is going to France soon. Im seriously considering asking him to bring me one.

2558~~~
Dont think he'll end up as a 9 to be honest, way too complete and all round for that.

2559~~~
And here was me thinking he had just one facial expression.

2560~~~
It'd be perfect if we had two of him - one for the left and one upfront.

We need to buy the next Martial.

2561~~~
Think he will end up as a centre forward with freedom to roam and drop deep as he sees fit. His hold up play and the way he turns defenders with his back to the goal are great qualities, which imo, would be better utilised up front. I can see the merits of having him on the left and cutting in but he can do just that, dropping into the left channels/flank from a central role ala peak Henry for Arsenal. Some facets of his game, esp his movement off the ball in addition to those highlighted above, would probably be better suited to a roaming centre forward-esque role.

2562~~~
Yup. Would hate to see him pushed out left even if I think he'd learn that role faster. His skill set is just too unique to not let him take more time to develop a more complex game as a centre forward. He has showed his ability to drift out wide and provide dribbling from both wings, his hold up play has been magnificent and a real surprise as well and he also has a fantastic technique and link up game. 

It is obviously a lot harder to make the right decision when you are played centrally with so much freedom and versatility but he's never going to be a better winger than someone like Robben or Hazard as he isn't specialized enough. As a centre forward I can't mention three top strikers who has better dribbling than him and he's already very complete and just has to develop his game.

2563~~~
What is it with people wanting to change positions of players who are doing very well? Happened with Jones who was shafter out to the right and then somehow into midfield before getting his first serious run of games at center half after about 2 years. Likewise with Di Maria who was thrown all around the pitch instead of being utilized in the only position he ever excelled in.

2564~~~
He has only played a dozen of his 80 games as a striker though. I do think that he is a striker but it's not where he played at professional level.

2565~~~
If we brought someone like Griezmann in, we could play at totally fluid front four. I'd love to see that, but I'm not sure Van Gaal would agree.

2566~~~
I'd prefer for us to change to a front three, moving to three centre midfielders, but it doesn't look like happening anytime soon, unfortunately.

2567~~~
Why do they chop off the top and bottom of the screen? Annoying YT vids!

2568~~~
so that youtube wont delete them due to copyright - no channel id

2569~~~
We should buy Griezman (and Mane) regardless. Van Gaal is only going to be here for about another year and half.

2570~~~
He's such an efficient and elegant player but he combines that so well with his physique and pace. Such a joy to watch.

Saying that though, it takes a lot of physical endurance to do what's he doing and I hope we don't burn him out. 

Right now, he's doing the stuff that uses a lot of strength and stamina like hold up play, running the channels and generally being up top alone. It's not whether he has the body or stamina for it, you will eventually wear down during the season, especially for a 19 year old playing in the premier league and having more than 1 game a week.

2571~~~
Not seen much of Griezman but Mane should be bought. He's exactly the type of player we should be buying in January.

2572~~~
His strength to hold the ball and ability to turn the defender is scarily good for a 19yr old. And that's what now, 2 caps and 2 assists? Do we have to pay Monaco for that?

2573~~~
I have often seen that lately, Southampton aren't going to sell Mané in January.

2574~~~
Why the hell did Arsene baulk at the price? He hooks up so well with Giroud!

I'm so happy we got him!

2575~~~
Maybe Arsene loves to do this with money than spend it.


<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--JMX7gP9P--/17kdjxvdqvygyjpg.jpg" src="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--JMX7gP9P--/17kdjxvdqvygyjpg.jpg"/>

2576~~~
As I've said to Arsene on many occasions over Sunday dinner in Totteridge:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/103whuH.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/103whuH.jpg"/>

However, as I have pointed out to Arsene over many a drunken game of Boules after rôti du dimanche … he needn't worry about Scrooge McDuck comparisons as that canny little feathered fella was born penniless in Glasgow, and if that description fits anyone … well you all see where this is going don't you!

2577~~~
Absolutely that's so fecking horrible. They want to make the video look more cinematic but than don't put in the effort to pan to the right segment of the video to keep the important stuff visible. Just like the shitty effects some of these people put over all their videos, it's fecking horrible and don't get me started on the god awful music.

2578~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2579~~~
The Youtube video makers have to crop the videos because of copyright.

2580~~~
So it's fair use if they just take parts focus on one player and add something (black bars, effects, music) themselves? Or just because they can't show anything from the TV-Station that broadcasted the game? I just wished they would do something else that was less annoying but hell I also get that they need to be quick with the videos to get them out and still take up a lot of their free time to do these videos. So in the end I'm glad someone even makes to effort to do these videos at all.

2581~~~
It's bloody hard to find a quality number 9 these days and there's an abundance of wide forwards/ wingers out there. If we find a player who has potential to be one of the best number 9's in the world, we'd be bloody well wise to keep him there if you ask me.

Only way I could see moving him to wing as worthwhile is if we somehow bought Lewandowski and I don't see that happening unfortunately.

2582~~~
We'll need him at his best vs Everton, that's for sure. Kind of unfair that he's this amount of burden, so soon. Mostly down to Rooney offering us muck.

2583~~~
Because Lewandowski is going to Liverpool for just 40M <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2584~~~
I say bring back Khalid Boulahrouz

2585~~~
Correct. Second we find a quality centre forward everyone wants to put him on the wing. Bizarre

2586~~~
There is nothing bizarre about it, we bought a player who excelled on the wing in the last 14 months, it's true that he is projected as a striker and that he has done very well for us but there is absolutely no reason to ignore his past year and not allow ourselves to think about all the possible adjustments that we could make regarding our attack.
Now because we have Memphis and because Memphis is a talented prospect we should consider that Martial will be a striker for us in the future, but if we have the opportunity to sign a better striker than Memphis is a winger or if Wilson breaks out, we know that Martial is potentially as good on the left than he is in the middle.

2587~~~
We seem to be hell bent on getting Muller but even then we lose a bit of pace up top with him leading the line and shifting Martial wide.
Having Martial allows us the potential to have a fluid attacking formation, players that can drift and interchange along the front 3. Signing a Reus /Bale would accommodate that even more. Just because Martial would find himself drifting in from the left wouldn't necessarily mean he's being played from there. He would still be a striker.
Kind of how we played Rooney / Ronaldo /Tevez

2588~~~
He clearly would make an excellent winger but he is going to be one of the best centre forwards in the game. He can drift wide to find space but his main value will be as a striker.

2589~~~
He has the same potential in both positions, like you I see him becoming a great Lewandowski-Suarez hybrid (I suppose that it is what you see in him) but he could also be a sort of Cristiano Ronaldo.
The problem with Martial is that he exploits two different part of his skillset in those positions, you can't really say that he wastes something on the wing and you can't really say that he wastes something upfront. What I do see though is that he plays more naturally on the wing at the moment, he has to decide where he wants to be a top player because in term of skills he has the potential for both positions.

2590~~~
Can't they just cover the logo with a black square or something? Not sexy enough, better to cover some of the actual highlights?

2591~~~
IIRC, Youtube compare the video and audio charateristics, so if you don't want to see your video deleted you have to modify the audio and the images.

2592~~~
I tend to feel a great centre forward is a more valuable commodity. I wouldn't for example convert a good number 9 to a winger. His strenght with his back to goal makes him different from almost any winger IMO. He has the full package to be a striker so I say play him there. Closest to the goal where he can do the most damage and doesn't need to track back. Suarez could easily be a winger with his skill set. Would you play him there? Of course not as it would be a waste

2593~~~
I think that you didn't understand my point there is no conversion here, we are basically in the "Alaba case" we have a player who has been formed as a striker and know the position but who has been developed and played as a winger in his short professional career there is no conversion for us, we and he just have to chose the position. It's like Alaba.

2594~~~
Not so much a conversion but a choice. Where to play him. Surely it has to be as a striker based on the above. Henry could have been a winger. It would have been a mistake. We seem to be in a discussion about perhaps getting another striker and playing him wide. It would be a waste

2595~~~
He is a lot better than Henry on the wing, it's not even close. Henry was excellent at striking the ball and Martial isn't, if he has one flaw(not a big one) it will be his striking technique which could prevent him from being a great striker. And once again the waste would be to not think about all the options, players like Desailly, Makelele, Messi Iniesta, Alaba, Griezmann changed their positions, extended their options and had/have great careers at a world class level. Martial is neither a striker nor a winger, he is a fast, technical, powerful, creative player, as long as he has teammates playing on the same wavelength, he will shine.

A little bit of tinkering might show us something new, for example if I was LVG I would think about Memphis upfront and Martial on the left in a 4-3-3, I would try that in training.

2596~~~
Let's agree to disagree. I cant see him ending up anywhere but centre forward

2597~~~
Same tbh, he is good out wide, but his hold up play and strength along with ability to beat a man, make him the perfect 9

2598~~~
Just watched the highlights of the Denmark game and ....wow. I'm really struggling to think of many other young players who can play in two completely different positions so naturally. He completely tore the full back apart. Even when Rooney was younger and played wide it always seemed unnatural.

I've yet to see martial play badly yet. I have no idea how he managed to fly relatively under the radar so long

2599~~~
He's such a great player, he makes Giroud score. Sign him up!

2600~~~
Imagine if we got Griezmann? Just the thought of it makes me 38,7% hard. A French Connection to make Wenger cry.

I would usually say that we shouldn't dream, that United don't go for muppet fantasies like this. But Woody is such a man, that I doubt nothing.

2601~~~
Apparently that's how the bonuses work in his case, 25 goals for us is first 10M Euro, 25 times picked for the NT is another 10 and shortlist(?) for top 10 Ballon d'Or would add another 10.

Seems that Enquetes de Foot (some French canal+ sport programme) dedicated one of their episodes or a good chunk of it to Martial and all the things regarding his transfer/move to Manchester. Apparently it was Chelsea who offered more money for him but he wanted to join us and that was the factor that decided whole thing. Usually French canal+ sport was spot on with their information regarding transfers from Ligue 1/of the French national team players iirc.

Maybe <a class="username" data-user="49797, @Rooney in Paris" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/49797/">@Rooney in Paris</a>, <a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a>  or <a class="username" data-user="26211, @kouroux" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/26211/">@kouroux</a> know a thing or two more or can translate some of the things because my French is pretty rusty and there's some information more regarding Anthony on <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/enquetes2foot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/enquetes2foot</a> 's timeline.

2602~~~
This is some information I didn't know of and tbh you translated it perfectly.

2603~~~
<a class="username" data-user="64979, @Kostur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64979/">@Kostur</a> I haven't watched the show but from the twitter timeline, you said everything.

2604~~~
I'll have to try to catch a replay of the show, could be interesting.

2605~~~
chew on that Jose!

2606~~~
Yup, thought so.

2607~~~
Ha!

So that's the final proof that Pedro was the panic buy and Martial was actually everybody's first choice. A lot of egg on faces in the media (and on the caf) right now.

2608~~~
You know that's only just occurred to me. Great stuff <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2609~~~
Giroud nearly missed this brilliant assist.

Fantastic stuff by Martial.

2610~~~
It's still early days but haven't been excited about a young prospect since Ronaldo.
He said in an interview after the France match that he prefers to play the main striker

2611~~~
What about Rooney?

2612~~~
Martial has started games as striker even with Rooney in the side. LVG realized that Rooney as striker wasnt working. He's our number 1 striker at the club now.

2613~~~
Didn't think of that! So we actually won the transfer market trophy this season.

2614~~~

2615~~~
could do worse on your first month in a new league. 

fantastic player to have. congrats to him and us.

2616~~~
Definitely deserved.

2617~~~
And we never actually bid for Pedro. We were in Barcelona to bid for Neymar. 

Pedro talk came from Pedro agent <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2618~~~
Rooney & Ronaldo were around the same time as youngsters and Ronaldo had this extra star quality but Rooney not far behind

2619~~~
Incredible. Hope it inspires Rooney and Memphis to step up.

2620~~~
The photo is great. Cool as a cucumber. It's becoming a cliche but really, nothing fazes him.

2621~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/TNu7QxY.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/TNu7QxY.jpg"/>

Starting to think he's a machine.

2623~~~
Brilliant <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Well deserved award Martial! Keep'em coming and we don't even have to pay any extras to Monaco for that award! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2624~~~
Arsenal fans are having a meltdown on Twitter/ Facebook as they firmly believe Sanchez should've won it.

2625~~~
Was just coming here to post that he always has the same face, he's like the footballing version of Kimi Raikkonen.

2626~~~
September player of the month, for one good performance...in October? Arsenal fans really are a special bunch

2627~~~
He is absolutely smashing all my expectations of him when we signed him

2628~~~
That has nothing to do with what I was talking about.

2629~~~
Should be leading the line.

2630~~~
Looks average so far out wide for United. Van Gaal playing him in a restricted wide role is counter-productive for our team. If we did not have Herrera and Mata doing so well in that free role, I doubt our result will correlate with our performance.

2631~~~
Our best player last month and he gets shunted on a wing in order to accommodate Rooney. It's fecking pathetic how he's keeping the club by the balls and LVG deserves shit for not benching him.

2632~~~
Could be a bit tired, he's played a lot for a teenager recently. He can be much better than this out wide like he was for France in the internationals. Just a bit off the pace in that half.

2633~~~
Tbf we don't have many wide options.

2634~~~
But revisionist I think. At the time, Rooney appeared the far more exciting prospect (in my opinion, of course.) Things obviously turned out very differently, but Rooney circa 2004-6, was about as exciting as they come.

2635~~~
Should have scored really, looked like a bit of a scuff. Wasn't expecting Rooney to pass maybe?

2636~~~
Throw that useless sack of shit there then, Martial was excellent as the #9 so there's absolutely no point to break that.

2637~~~
Rather we drop Rooney and put Perriera out wide. Dare, I say I would not mind seeing Valencia either. Young when fit is also a much better option.

2638~~~
I can see logic in the move if it was done because of Coleman's pace. It's working at the moment anyway.

2639~~~
Put him back upfront please. Need a player who can actually run at their CB's and utilise the space created.

2640~~~
He's been solid on the ball but seems to be hampered by instructions to stay very wide.

2641~~~
Wasted on the wing considering how good he is up front. Offers so much more than ROoney.

2642~~~
with all the creativity from Herrera, Mata and Sweiny from the deep you'd expect Martial up front beating the line, stretching the play..

2643~~~
Needs to be in the middle, had some nice touches so far and probably should have scored. Still so far so good.

2644~~~
Should be leading the line but unfortunately, we don't have many options there right now. Depay is woefully off-form and Young is injured if I'm not wrong and Rooney... Well let's not get into that.

2645~~~
He's suffering the same fate as Depay usually does, constantly facing two or three defenders and having no space to go at the defense.

2646~~~
How on earth did he get through that gap in the 77th minute or so, if anyone could gif that at some point that'd be great.

2647~~~
How  he created space for that last chance I'll never know. What a man.

2648~~~
He's an absolute joy to watch, tormenting defenders in tight spaces

2649~~~
Long may this form he's in continue. What a player.

2650~~~
Ball is stuck to his feet.

2651~~~
Even in a restricted role, he still looks like a proper football, despite being his worst performance in a United shirt so far. Hopefully, we can put him down the middle in the next game.

2652~~~
He's amazing. So happy he's ours<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2653~~~
He should play as a number 9 nonetheless. Like I said, he was limited in his opportunities because they were able to constantly throw 2 or 3 guys at him.

2654~~~
He's ridiculous.

2655~~~
fecking hell he's bumraped Coleman today.

2656~~~
Superb.

How he doesn't have a goal or assist is beyond me.

2657~~~
Did the same thing again. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2658~~~
He's ripping Coleman apart. Robben-esque at times

2659~~~
How do you stop him?

2660~~~
It's all so easy for him. Incredible talent.

2661~~~
So comfortable inside and out.

2662~~~
This kid makes defenders shit their pants when he runs at them, it's so good having a player with that ability again.

2663~~~
Should've had 2 assists today. Is he really 19 <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> ?

2664~~~
Best u21 player in the world without a doubt. So fecking good.

2665~~~
And people were worried about our left side <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2666~~~
Just waiting for Memphis get his act together as well.

2667~~~
Better on the left than Memphis ever was. Excellent player.

2668~~~
Martial was on auto pilot for that second half. Just toying with these fools.

2669~~~
that performance deserved at least an assist.

2670~~~
I've held it in apart from some very good ''potential'' praise til now but feck me this kid is going to be world class.

2671~~~
It's incredible what kind of dribbles he was still doing after 80 minutes or so on the pitch. Great player already.

2672~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The state of Seamus Coleman today.

2673~~~
Relatively quiet first half but he had Coleman on toast every time he touched the ball. Brilliant, brilliant player.

2674~~~
Martial... what a performance. You wouldn't think that Coleman is actually one of the best right backs in the league. This reminded me of Bale vs. Maicon.

2675~~~
He made Coleman look like a decrepit old man.

2676~~~
Incredible.

2677~~~
His best games have been the ones he hasn't scored in <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Such an incredible talent. What a waste of money indeed.

2678~~~
I don't understand how he beats his man so reliably, great player to watch.

2679~~~
Despite being played on the wing he still managed to create 2 or 3 chances that should've been burried, he's like Flash in the tight spaces ffs.

2680~~~
It's all in his hips, just drifts past players like they're not even there and Coleman is one of the better full-back's in the league, just so, so good to have someone that teams are already shit scared of.

2681~~~
He'd still be dangerous if we played him at centre back.


The chant where everyone mispronounces his name to the same tune as RVP's is seriously weak.

2682~~~
He can play alone against eleven players and still somehow create a chance for himself. Incredible talent.

2683~~~
Unlucky not to get a couple of assists and a goal.

Just a ridiculously talented player who can play anywhere up front.

2684~~~
That second half was a joy to watch. Poor Coleman

2685~~~
Take note Memphis.

2686~~~
I loved the fact that he understood his role and tracked back. Unlike depay, he did  do that. He also did coleman in both sides and also via pace. Amazing !! Best player in the world.

2687~~~
Up against one of the league's best RBs and still did a job on him in attack and defence.

Hopefully we see him back up front next time though.

2688~~~
Hasnt scored in a while, but stats aside, what a player. Always impressive..

2689~~~
Had an answer for everything Coleman's mustered.

2690~~~
Coleman will be checking his house to make sure Martial isn't hiding somewhere to terrorise him after today.

2691~~~
Martial made Coleman look average. His change of pace from a standing start is frightening. My God, we've got a gem on our hands.

2692~~~
Imagine it was Ivanovic in his current form <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2693~~~
Coleman won't want to see him again.

2694~~~
Reminded me of Messi at the Stamford Bridge in 2005.

2695~~~
Couldn't agree more. He's going to be an absolute star in a year or two. Look how composed he looks already.

2696~~~
Time for a new 10 year contract, unbelievable talent!!

2697~~~
Beats defenders for fun and is almost impossible to dispossess inside the box. Unfortunately didn't score the chance he had, but another very impressive performance, especially given how much attention Everton were giving him. Just sensational.

2698~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/e9KDIUPraEW/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

2699~~~
How easily he strolls past defenders is downright bizarre. Even when there is no physical space in which to do so he somehow manages it.

2700~~~
Monaco deserves another 10m Euros for that performance alone.

2701~~~
Coleman wasn't completely fit, but that shouldn't take away from the consistency with which Martial beasted him

2702~~~
How the feck did he get out of that? Like, seriously. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

2703~~~
That's being kind to Coleman... those last 15 minutes, they were all shitting themselves whenever Martial got the ball at his feet. You could see Martial just knew he had the beating of him and could take him whenever he wanted. Brilliant player already, not just potential.

2704~~~
brilliant again today, he is immense. No need to concern ourselves with his age because at this stage he needs games to push on some more.

2705~~~
He has the Suarez 'flooky' dribbling ability

2706~~~
I missed it so I was hoping someone would upload it. Feck me, he's good.

2707~~~
Cops would have a preemptive arrest warrant against him before that matchup.

2708~~~
yeah.....total waste of money......

2709~~~
He's just so good. He's already exceeded my expectations for this season.

2710~~~
The ball was stuck to his feet this whole time. Amazing.

2711~~~
Despite no goal and no assist, he delivered a much better and complete performance than either Young and Depay all season long. Not surprising because it's where he showed most of his talent at Monaco. What a player.

2712~~~
That would have been a Suarez-like goal. If only it had gone in!! It would have been replayed for years.

2713~~~
You don't see Seamus Coleman get run ragged like that very often <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2714~~~
What do you mean by restricted role? Genuine question

2715~~~
I love the way he seems to think "ok, I have the ball, and the goal's over there somewhere. So I'm going to run in that direction and sod anyone in my way."

2716~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Downright bizarre indeed it is! At that specific part, he really reminds me of the Brazilian Ronaldo. He also just stood there, decided to run past the player like he wasn't there and went on and did it. If he can manage to be half the player Ronaldo was, we're really in for exciting times.

2717~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2718~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that's exactly the right description. I used to think Suarez was just lucky and the ball was just getting stuck under his feet at the right time. However, it's quite clear that this sort of dribbling is intentional.

2719~~~
The way he plays and dribbles reminds me of Suarez but not a cnut.

2720~~~
Excellent towards the end. Run Coleman ragged. Even out wide, he's superb. Frightening talent. 

Would prefer him up top, but he's definitely a viable option out on the left.

2721~~~
Rest him against Moscow, or?

2722~~~
Positional instructed to limit his movement across our front line and give us natural width so as not to have our midfield clogged up in the center. In layman term, he played like a traditional winger, rather than one that roams freely like we saw Mata or Herrera play today.

2723~~~
Aye. Absolutely incredible how he just changes pace, a quick movement of the pitch and the defender's fecked. Effortless. Superb superb talent.

2724~~~
I was like that with Martial for a while too last season, I just couldn't comprehend why defenders weren't able to dispossess him with the way he dribbled and ran at people. When someone does something over and over again, it really is a skill.

2725~~~
He was making me laugh at how casual he was when he wanted to go past Coleman today. He picks up the ball and it's almost as if he's thinking "Shall I bother to run past him or not". Feel a bit silly comparing the two but he reminds me of Messi with his dribbling.

2726~~~
Ah gotcha! He was amazing in that 2nd half. He's first 10 metres of sprinting is Usain Bolt like, he's past you before you know it

2727~~~
What a fecking player. That's just my reaction every single time he plays for us. Destroyed Coleman in the second half and had some absolutely magical moments in their box with his exceptional technique.

2728~~~
Exactly. You can't have that much luck consistently.

2729~~~
Some fans compared him with Henry, but I do not see that. Suarez always seemed more accurate. If he can work on his distance shooting/technical finishing, then that comparison will be pretty accurate.

2730~~~
He's proving many many people wrong
Think Blind and Depay might play in Moscow with one eye on the Derby vs the rag racists

2731~~~
He's toying with these fools son. The kid is something special, had Coleman chasing shadows.

2732~~~
Absolutely disgusting how good he is

2733~~~
The way he glides past players without looking like he is trying is a thing of rare beauty. A bit quiet in the first but looked the part in the second, if only we could play him on the left and centrally as he looks to be the best choice for both slots.

2734~~~
Le Tissier saying he was quiet <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2735~~~
His dribbling is better than Henry's imo.

2736~~~
He doesn't seem to like shooting.

2737~~~
Immense player

2738~~~
He's something else, fantastic player, he roasted Coleman in the second half.

2739~~~
I'll say it again....a few years time?...Real Madrid <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

2740~~~
his control is frightening. I don't get the Suarez comparison, he is all failed nutmegs and hustle. Martial is like a professional burglar silently gliding through your house at night

2741~~~
Feck off <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2742~~~
That's not even remotely true. Suarez is a great dribbler.

2743~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2744~~~
Though he was quiet first half, I think playing him out wide meant that their full back wasn't so keen to go forwards. Second half, him and Lingard gave us great options on the break. The goals may have dried up but he's always creating something like a proper winger should

2745~~~
Wasn't particularly happy to see him shunted out wide to begin with and thought he was fairly quiet in the first half, but in the second he had Coleman all over the place and he deserved an assist or a goal without question.

2746~~~
that's really original man, congrats!

2747~~~
so what..it's the truth.

2748~~~
Compared to his other performances he was. He'll be held to a very high standard because he's started his tenure with us at a very high level and also performed very well for France.

Compared to other wingers, he still did well today. Easily my favorite footballer in the world right now.

2749~~~
It really isn't. You're free to believe that we're doomed to lose every single talented player we'll ever have to Real Madrid though.

2750~~~
Shut up Togg you dick. This Madrid' stuff is boring. I seem to think he's playing for Manchester United. Let's not forget, he's got a family and he's with child. He could quite easily settle in Manchester for a long time.

2751~~~
Oh right, I'm a dick. So if Martial develops into a top top lethal striker Real Madrid won't sniff around and try to buy him? What planet are YOU living on?

2752~~~
No not every talented player...just one that could potentially score a lot of goals...

2753~~~
How can the only thing some people think about after signing a top class player is Madrid? Are you still having nightmares about Ronaldo? fecking hell...

2754~~~
And that automatically means we're gonna sell or he desperately wants to go there? We're still United and well on our way back to the place we belong. We can compete with them for players.

2755~~~
I love watching this guy get on the ball. Doesn't seem to matter who is around him, he is strong enough to hold off players, and his feet quick enough to beat his man more often than not. Really helps the team as a whole having a player like him on the pitch. Defenders don't seem to know what to do against him right now, and it helps us push teams back, while opening space up for others.

2756~~~
Your life must be amazing fun. Failing to enjoy today because tomorrow <i>might</i> be bad <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2757~~~
Well on our way to where we belong? Oh come on...we are way off that at the moment. Perhaps we will be..who knows...I'm just saying don't be surprised if he is successful that they come sniffing..that is all. He has such huge talent. We nurtured Ronaldo and he went, we pretty much only kept De Gea through default..but don't tell me he didn't want to go and kudos to him for putting in top performances now....but he'll be off, no doubt.

2758~~~
I have to disagree with that though. Not currently yet.

2759~~~
You are so wrong. I loved today, love the players we have, think we have a  team that could really grow. I'm just cynical about the money in football at the moment that is all.

2760~~~
In the future I meant, once Martial is at a point where they're gonna be interested in him. Watch us win the title this year and things are gonna look differently.

2761~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/yxud" width="560"></iframe>

2762~~~
Really good in the second half, always looked the most likely to make something happen, but I don't want him out on the left long term.

2763~~~
Give Berbatov cup of coffee and he'll turn into El Martialinho.

Insane ball control at his age and always looks like he just don't care how good he already is.

2764~~~
<img alt=":yawn:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/yawn.gif" title="Yawn    :yawn:"/>

2765~~~
Can't wait for his match highlights <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2766~~~
He looks so natural with the ball I half expect him to dink one in from range or swing a lovely volley but he doesn't look interested in that.

2767~~~
We can offer more money than Madrid and it'll only get worse for them in that respect. Just enjoy Martial's performances and don't be needlessly pessimistic that we might lose him if Madrid show an interest. Even if they become interested, there's nothing to suggest that he'd want to leave or we'd agree to sell.

2768~~~
ah shurup...

2769~~~
I'm loving him....believe me. One of those who thought he wasn't a waste of money but a great signing. Ah well...if everyone agreed with everyone else on here..well..it would be a bit boring wouldn't it?

2770~~~
Does he wear invisible skates or something? Feck sake, he is 19 but he just 'glides' through players at will. Unreal potential.

2771~~~
Maybe it's premature but I think he's world class already, the way the ball sticks to his foot is very much like Hazard and when you combine that with explosive directness and an intelligent head this is the result. I really do think he will tear up the league this year and could well win us a title of the rest of the team falls into place.

2772~~~
He is on his way to being the difference maker for us. Every team has one. Hazard or Sanchez or Aguero. He could be our talisman.

2773~~~
The planet where by that time we will have a lot more money than Madrid and probably a stronger outlook for the future.

2774~~~
Very impressed, wow how good could he be ?

2775~~~
Should of had a couple of assists today. Class.

2776~~~
First half was as quiet as he's been so far. Not that he was bad or anything. Once the game got a bit more stretched he was absolutely roasting Coleman. I never saw him play for Monaco so that's the first I've seen from him as a winger and I'm quite impressed!

2777~~~
So he's shuffled to the left to accommodate an out of form Rooney and he does pretty well. Gets his marker booked early on, and twice dances into the box where he'd have enjoyed having someone to pass it to. 

More impressive as a striker but the kid is exciting to watch. Probably more efficient on the left than Memphis as he seems to have a better understanding of the game, but the two of them will link up well in the future.

2778~~~
ok..fine

2779~~~
I was surprised to see people upset by the simple thought of him on the wing, but you made me realize that most United fans don't know him.

2780~~~
So, instead of enjoying a player that plays for us, you are worried about him performing, because Real Madrid would come sniffing, let's buy lots of average players then, that's the solution.

2781~~~
That right there is just insane. The chest control, the movement away, luring them out,  then dribbling away two defenders with no fecking space to work on. If he had scored it would have been the goal of the season

When he scored against Liverpool, i might have thought he was another Macheda, but since then he hes swept away all doubts. Looks like we are going to have to pay Monaco the full fee. Future Ballon d'or winner for sure

2782~~~
He's like a more technically gifted Henry. I'm off to go get his shirt tomorrow.

2783~~~
He's too f*cking good.

2784~~~
I think people were more annoyed that he was being moved to accommodate an out of form Rooney than thinking he wouldn't be suited to the wing. I readily admit I knew absolutely nothing about him until we signed him though.

2785~~~
He can play up front, on the left and even on the right side of the attacking trio. He has lots of talent, it just matters that he's on the pitch. A bit surprised by the negativity with him playing on the left before the match.

2786~~~
I think he has been very good on the left from what I've seen of him (friendlies for France and highlights today) however I would still prefer to see him as centre forward due to his cool finishing

2787~~~
I've watched that around 15 times now and I'm still none the wiser at how he did that <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2788~~~
His finishing is probably the aspect of the game he needs to improve the most. He scored 4 goals and it is impressive but I wouldn't much more from him in terms of goalscoring.

2789~~~
Good way to improve in that aspect is to play up to right?

2790~~~
I know it's a lazy comparison but the way he sort of teased and lured out the back and then sped past him reminded me of Henry.

2791~~~
It was another pleasing performance by him today, every time I watch him play he shows something new to his game and he is intelligent which is impressive with him being young, little things like when he was running at Coleman and one time he would cut inside but then the next time he would go down the line. I was saying to the tv don't cut inside this time as to keep Coleman guessing, so it was nice when Martial mixed it up.

2792~~~
It's crazy, Coleman (I think its him) just seems to pass straight through him, would have been a great goal.

2793~~~
Not necessarily. What matters is playing in position/system that allows him to have chances to shoot the ball. He had a good chance for instance (the Rooney pass) but delivered a weak shot for instance today. No matter where he plays, he'll have opportunities, the rest will improve with time and experience.

2794~~~
Doesn't seem to like shooting.

2795~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>needs to start scoring again, it's gone a little quiet.
if I'm being critical. which I am

2796~~~
He goes from like walking pace to full sprint in a couple of seconds.

2797~~~
In what sense?

2798~~~
My reaction when he went by a few players with so little space was pretty much "What the feck?". Similar to that goal Ruud scored in the CL about 12 or 13 years back (can't remember against who)**, although Martial didn't score obviously.

Incredible talent. Can play across the front three, can run at players, can finish, can assist, can beat players consistently, can hold the ball up. Good first touch, good strenght, excellent ball control. Has to be one of the best young players in the world at the moment. I'd never heard of him before we bought him, so well done scouts.

**Yeah, was against Basel:

2799~~~
He has no fear, he gets the ball, can run at players (and get away from them with no problem), and he got his head up. Looked very mature a times. Always happy with signings like him.

2800~~~
Do you think so? When he gets into scoring positions he seems very composed to me. I think maybe his passing can be erratic (although looking at the pass to Rooney and for Giroud in the week can be very good)

2801~~~
100% sure, his passing and even crossing is absolutely fine/good for his age. His finishing will improve with time, he needs more power and "anger" with his shooting.

2802~~~
nah..I am enjoying it. I'm just bored with the way money has affected the game and subsequent loyalty that is all. I've been around a long time and I've come to realise that club loyalty is something of the past because of the money involved. I'm not saying he will definitely leave and I will enjoy him here. But....I'm just cynical that is all. No one has to take any notice...but just putting my thoughts forward...that is all. Dear me....if we were talking in the pub it would be an off the cuff comment..on here it becomes some sort of political statement...I give up...

2803~~~
Martials situation is different then your average young player. He's married and has a child. It's not so easy uprooting a family. I think Manchester would probably suit his family. Once they speak the language they'll be fine. Everyone's situation is unique but let's drop this Madrid bs. People don't want to read it because it's irritating. Even if they offered 100m, why would we sell? We're not a selling club. Other players have different situations and sometimes that dictates but he's playing with lots of confidence. I think that's a sign he's happy and we should be happy!

2804~~~
If money's all that matters then we have nothing to worry about in the medium term.

Within a few years we'll be able to just say no to Madrid, as they won't be able to offer us sums that would tempt us to sell. 

The worm is turning.

2805~~~
Cheshire is a great place to raise a family. Madrid and Barcelona are better if you want to be a party boy.

To be honest, I'm quite happy to lose out on players who choose to chase that kind of lifestyle. If Ronaldinho had had his head screwed on right, Fergie could have eked and extra 3 or 4 seasons out of him at United.

I think Martial will enjoy the pace of life here. There's still plenty to do for a multimillionaire. He seems the level-headed type who'll want to stay.

2806~~~
Martial.......Rooney.......mata
..................Herrera

Are currently stronger than 

Memphis........Martial......Mata
.................Rooney

I say keep him out there. I love the fluid movement we showed today

2807~~~
I'd personally probably put Herrera in Rooney's place. I'd like Martial to be our main man up front, although I'll still be fairly content if we stick with what we did today since Martial's shown he can be versatile and play out wide too.

2808~~~
And

----------Martial------
Young---Herrera---Mata

is stronger then both of those.

2809~~~

2810~~~
Non sense.

2811~~~
I hope us getting this lad says we have now got a solid scouting network in France. French players adapt better in teh Premiership that South Americans.

2812~~~
He is literally insanely good.

I fecking LOVE him.

2813~~~
Congratulations on winning September Player of the Month. Now play on the left wing so Wayne Rooney can take your position.

2814~~~
He showed moments of absolute class on the left, but I didn't think he was that great. At least not in terms of end product. He's need to improve the timing of his runs and/or his final ball if he's going to be our regular option on the left. I'd personally rather see him up front with Rooney on the left. The latter is a top crosser of the ball and we could definitely use that.

2815~~~
Please dont shun him to the left in favor of rooney.  He's a mercurial talent and shunting hin left will only delay his progress.  You dont mess with kids position juat for the sake of it

2816~~~
Our focus should be about building a top team and nice playing environment that no player want to leave the club in the future. There is no point worrying about losing Martial when he hasn't even played 10 games for us yet.

Having said that, we probably need to tie him down with a new contract at least 2 years before it expires.

2817~~~
Like kouroux said:

He's primarily played on the wing for Monaco and his goal against Liverpool came from the left. He also played out wide for France during International break and got MOTM apparently so I wouldn't really compare it to, say, putting Sturridge out on the left in favour of Ings up front for Liverpool (hypothetical scenario).

I see Martial's primary role as striker and I'm sure the club do too, but he did very well and with the contrast in Memphis' form on the left to Martial's form on the left it was worth seeing how he'd do there for us.

2818~~~
I don't mind a few match for rotation. But at 19 he needs to be playing in his best position and not messer around.  It might work but overall imho it wont benefit him.  He might still turns into a great  player but with these kinds of talent you cant take the risk.  I really dont want him to end up like rooney or kuyt or oshea and any other jack of all trades master of none. 

World class talent plays in their favored position,  the rest have to make room and not the other way around

2819~~~
Every time I see him go up against 2 defenders, I am like "What the feck are you doing?! Just pass!" and he manages to skin them with such ease it's astonishing! Absolutely monster of a player. Can't believe he is ours. His overall play is a huge boost to our side and his holdup play really helps us mount an attack. Loving it!

2820~~~
How did he get player of the month in the league, while Mata got our player of the month?!

Bizarre

2821~~~
I thought playing him on the left was just a tactical decision to help nullify Coleman's attacking threat and exploit the space he leaves behind on the counter? 

Certainly hope it isn't something we see too often. I want the striker who looks most likely to score playing as a striker.

2822~~~
Champions league.

2823~~~
Paging Jamie Redknapp.

2824~~~
Not trying to be a smart arse but, I don't understand....

2825~~~
League player of the month is based on league performances, ours is based on league and CL. Mata played brilliantly in that CL game recently so that might have given him the edge there?

2826~~~
Ah I see....Was sitting here trying to remember what Martial done in the CL <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2827~~~
It has already benefited him immensely as a player. Modern day football requires footballers to be as complete and versatile as possible. I can understand the fear of him becoming like Kuyt but think of the likes of Messi/Muller, players who are able to different positions at a great level. It can even be said that playing him as a central striker isn't his "natural" position.

2828~~~
He did well on the left. I hope we learn from the past so history doesn't repeat itself. Moving players out of their best position can impact their development. Martial looks to be a mercurial talent and I want us to build the team around him as the central attacking force instead of sacrificing him for the sake of senior players. Rooney should be accommodating Martial, not the other way around.

2829~~~
I still think it was ridiculous that we moved him out wide to accomodate Rooney when he's the in form striker.

2830~~~
Maybe it was LVG's intention to let Martial show to Depay how it should be played on the left wing. We can't seriously rely on just Martial on the left and afford Depay sitting on bench when our striker situation isn't that great

2831~~~
Shame he wasn't in the middle as he'd of murdered Jagielka for pace.

2832~~~
Martial completely nullified the Everton wing attack on his side, tracking back stopping overlaps, cutting off Lukakus supply.

2833~~~
That is never going to happen as Martial just arrived and Rooney is the club captain. Besides playing Martial on the left isn't playing him out of position.

2834~~~
I don't know why people are so against him playing on the left. He has played that position regularly and he's fantastic there both offensively and defensively. Rooney hasn't been good for years but as he seems undroppable, this is the best formation for us. Herrera-Mata-Martial can only happen properly if Rooney is used as "9". 

And whether we can afford to keep Depay on the bench should be no issue, we clearly have better options for forming our attack. Best players should play, and yesterday we saw a line-up where Rooney was the only "problem".

2835~~~
Wee need another equally good dribbler in the side. This possibilities<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2836~~~
Martial playing on the left is not "out of position" by any stretch of the imagination. What's wrong with people? There's always something to moan about on here.

2837~~~
I know, it's because they don't have a clue.

2838~~~
That ball control at 6:41 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2839~~~
On of my friends was working in his box at one of our home games. Was saying how the family is very nice even if their English was limited. Got a cute baby too.

2840~~~
The thing I love about this lad is his attitude. Its funny cause it's the exact opposite of what's often levelled at these type of players. Worked hard and tracked back. Also dribbles but knows when to play it simple. No tats, coloured hair or anything else symbolic of footballers beyond their football. I'm guessing this lad won't have a yellow Lambo either. 
Hopefully he'll continue to grow cause he's fits a united profile to the tee. Memphis should take note. Football first.....

2841~~~
That's a good point. I still think he'd make a bigger impact on the game playing as the central striker though.

2842~~~
Plus I think Martial won our POTM the month before, so there may have been a wee bit of fixing from our side. The votes were 44% Mata and 42% Martial.

2843~~~
We looked better upfront with him being deployed as a winger. He has the pace and the skill, and it's not a role that is foreign to him at all.

LVG probably put Rooney in front to handle the finishing, letting the young Martial do all the work. It's kind of funny when you realise that Martial is being over utilised, in order to support a man who performed a similar task for the team for almost a decade, which will inevitably have an effect on his end product, but make the team better,overall.

Hopefully, this doesn't become a permanent role, as it could lead to exhaustion and a decline in performances in his late 20s, and ultimately, and if history is anything to go by, his goal scoring is going to be heavily criticised in the "Is Martial a legend and where does he rank, if yes?" thread in 2025.

2844~~~
Usually you'd say people are going overboard when they say a 19 year old is a nailed on future superstar, but this guy is too good. He does everything with ease that a lot if top footballers don't start doing until well into their twenties. He's actually a sensation.

2845~~~
Silky.

2846~~~
Which is strange as I remember reading that he may be a bit lazy when we signed him. This doesn't appear to be the case at all so far

2847~~~
Done a brilliant job tracking back! Completely shut down Everton's right side and gave Coleman nightmares. 

Should play on the left against City too. I fancy him up against Zaba.

2848~~~
Its not Martial as wing that people are worried with, its rather Rooney as a 9, especially based on what he has shown this season. Martial offers us more as 9 compared to our captain, he also offers a lot as a winger..so yes.

2849~~~
Sagna seems to be first choice this season.

2850~~~
I don't want to involve myself in the whole argument of where to play Martial, but for me it was pretty clear that starting him on the left was circumstantial. Van Gaal clearly wanted another body in midfield so he started with Herrera behind Rooney. Martial on the left was the obvious choice as Rooney can't play there, Young is injured and Memphis is currently shit. 

Playing Martial on the left isn't exactly playing him out of position as he played there for Monaco quite a lot and was very good, but I think he already confirmed that his prefered position is the centre forward. Playing the odd game on the wing in certain games against certain opponents is perfectly fine, if there aren't better options - as was the case yesterday.

2851~~~
And Rooney as a striker offers us a lot more than Rooney as a #10, while Martial also offers more than Memphis. If Memphis performs well we have to bench Rooney and put Martial upfront.

2852~~~
perhaps they would be wiser to not moan after a 0-3 victory where rooney scores one, is unlucky not to score from a martial long ball down the flank and is unlucky not to have an assist for Martial to his name

2853~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2854~~~
I'm not sure about him offering more as striker..but , if its between him and Memphis, then Rooney edges it..and lets just hope his striking improves.

2855~~~
They are possibly not basing their entire opinion on one game..I think. But Rooney's past perfomance as striker in LVG's system.

2856~~~
Rooney offers more as striker than Rooney as a #10. You don't really think that he is a superior #10, right?

2857~~~
Would be great to see Martial up front with Herrera behind. I think he would get a lot of chances created for him

2858~~~
No, no at all. My argument is that he offers less as a striker than Martial. The way Martial played as striker suited us perfectly, and as not every stiker can thrive in this system, not necessarily because they are poor players as Falcao and RVP showed last season. But I understand that we dont have much a choice, so hopefully he steps up. Martial's hold up play was particularly impressive and I felt that is something we solely missed . But if its Memphis v Rooney, Id choose Rooney.

2859~~~
Hasn't Zaba played the last couple of games? Don't know who started yday though.

2860~~~
Saga started.

2861~~~
At left back.

2862~~~
Saga <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2863~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Fecking iPad.

2864~~~
Can Martial play the number 10 role <a class="username" data-user="26211, @kouroux" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/26211/">@kouroux</a> ?

2865~~~
Would destroy both Zabaleta and Sagna who both aren't the quickest.

2866~~~
Once we get Muller, that's where he will play <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2867~~~
Out of interest is Martial getting similar gushing praise from the media/oppo fans as he receives on here? I've somehow avoided football analysis all season so far.

2868~~~
Against City I'd hope Martial would play up front, drifting wide as he does, and have Rooney on the left. That way Martial can go on either side or through the middle and cause damage like that.

2869~~~
People really think Rooney would play on the left? Not a chance. He will either play as a striker or behind under van Gaal.

2870~~~
He played on the left 2nd half of the Arsenal game and looked the best he looked all season - the brugge game. Still not great though.

2871~~~
Was called poor man's Origi on RAWK.

2872~~~
I have never seen him play there so I don't know for certain (I don't think so anyway).

I know he has in France but that's mostly the good appearances he's had for the national team.

When you think of all the possible combinations with Martial/Rooney/Herrera/Memphis in those 3 positions (striker, left winger and 10), I think what LVG did yesterday was the best.

2873~~~
Every time I see him, it appears as if he is angry or couldn't be bothered...just looking at his face.  He goes about the pitch with a stone face, not much emotion, but then puts it into gear and plays incredibly.

Hope he continues to develop and become a world beater for us.

2874~~~
In the last 20 minutes, he madean absolute fool out of Coleman, could have gotten 2-3 assists as well, such an incredible player, especially at getting past players, and its his decision making that sets him apart from Depay, even though hes 2 years younger, does the right moves, dribbles tricks all at usually right times

2875~~~
Well that's the thing. You live for the past, you forget the present <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> Two quick wingers either side will suit Rooney. Sure he's had bad games but the teams reshaping itself and people should grow up. After all as main striker, Martial would be expected to get goals too but he's not scored in a few. So in that respect, he not only looked creative and tested the full back but he got into goal scoring areas of the pitch.

2876~~~
He's not scored in  a few, but you can see why one would want him as main striker, he is still very good without the goals. And creates opportunity for the rest of his teammates. I guess will see, Rooney cant possibly get any worse. Anyhow, lets stick to Martial.

2877~~~
Great player in the making. His dribbling is fantastic and I like how he can play as a winger.

The things that are holding him back is his decision making and his shot, but that will get better with age.

2878~~~
That's not the Memphis thread, mate. His decision making has been one of his main strenghts so far - he knows when to dribble, when to shoot and when to pass the ball. He's so confident in his abilities and he's showing some unbelievable maturity in his play. Can't believe he's 19 years old.

2879~~~
Yeah but when he makes his mind to dribble, most times he will keep dribbling until he loses the ball. Then sometimes he will lazy and sloppy passes at times. As I said, all these things will get better as he gets older.

2880~~~
His decision making has been great so far. It's not like Memphis where when he starts dribbling he runs into dead ends. He has most of the time passed it at the right moment, dribbled at the right time, and generally just picked the right option most of the time. No player is perfect with his decision making, so you can't fault him for losing the ball occasionally when dribbling, it happens to Messi, it'll happen to Martial. It could just be a great run of form, but his decision making (and overall game) has been at the level of a top class player in his prime really. Not a youngster.

He hasn't really properly shot all too often so we've yet to see how good of a shot he has really. Looking at his overall game, there's nothing really that sticks out as holding him back. He's been playing brilliantly and his overall game is very complete and at a very high level already. Which is ridiculous to say as he's just 19 years old, but he really doesn't have any weaknesses in his game. Probably his passing is the one thing, which is a bit inconsistent at times. Was hardly a problem though and has shown quality passes as well (like the ball up to Rooney for his chance).

2881~~~
Not sure how you can question his decision making. So far its been one of the most impressive things about the kid.

2882~~~
yep, good post.

2883~~~
3:16 - the way he just got past Stones, even if momentarily. Bloody hell, the speed of that turn. If he wasn't in a tight space on the wing, he'd have been away. 
The last chance he created at the end as well - so easy for him to just run past Coleman (?). Should have had an assist there.

Plus I'm fairly certain he did more defensive work in that game than Memphis has done so far at United.
(I'm a fan of Memphis, so even though this may seem like another dig towards him - it's more a praise on how fantastic Martial did on the wing).

2884~~~
My impression is that he's been rather consistent so far.

2885~~~
His tracking back got a special mention on MOTD.

2886~~~
Was he this good at Monaco or did he step it up since his transfer?

2887~~~
He was showing a lot of promise in the second half of last season and IMO the talent was quite obvious. I didn't expect him to be this good though.

2888~~~
I am asking because he looks scarily good at the age of 19 playing in a new league. Not just good but actually really really fecking good.

2889~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> brilliant

2890~~~
Poor mans Origi <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> mother of god...

2891~~~
I was thinking maybe the club fixed it so he didn't win it to try and cool the hype a little?

2892~~~
True Geordie on Martial's first goal. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2893~~~
That was idiotic!!

2894~~~
Is he trying to surpass Memphis'/Januzaj's record for most failed dribbles in one half? Right back has him in his pocket.

2895~~~
Need to move him upfront to get him into the game even if it means Rooney on the left

2896~~~
Very poor first half from him but this was always going to happen, yonug players are always more inconsitent and he was bound to have a game like this after his great start.

2897~~~
His first poor game for us really... Probably could've been a pen for us on him though at the start, but stupid pen to give away and their right back has the beating of him so far.
Honestly think the cold might be having an impact on him and the team. Everyone's touch and passing was off for the first 20 minutes really.

2898~~~
Turns out he is human after all.

2899~~~
Put him back central. We don't want him having to track back and defend.

2900~~~
He was crap but shouldn't be put out wide when he's looked class upfront, especially when his replacement is Rooney.

2901~~~
Struggling with being doubled or even tripled up on within a second of receiving the ball. CSKA have done their homework. He still looks like the only one who might make something happen though to be honest. As unsuccessful as his dribbling has been there's at least a conceivable possibility that he might make it past his men and do some damage. The endless sideways passing from everyone else will never create anything in a million years.

2902~~~
They are doubling him making it difficult for him. Solution would be for Rojo to overlap and take away the other man or Schweinsteiger or Rooney to get into the space left by the 2 defender. Unfortunately not happening. 

Either make them pay for doubling on him with proper overloading the others or put him in the center where they cannot double on him and he can run in behind. 

Btw why the feck does Rooney not try to run behind at all? Like not even once???? So easy to defend against.

2903~~~
He only played 90 minutes 5 times in 2 seasons at Monaco.. Not saying he is tired or anything... just that he isn't experienced. 
Looking a bit lost in a tough European away is not that surprising.
He'll learn from it.

2904~~~
sticking him out wide to facilitate Rooney playing doesn't half reduce his threat!

2905~~~
I'm not sure I get why he's staying wide when our right side's getting into crossing positions.

2906~~~
His development will be stunted due to being stuck out on the left wing because of Rooney.

2907~~~
Legend.

2908~~~
That's a ridiculous header

2909~~~
So he can head it as well <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2910~~~
Get him closer to goal and he scores. No surprises. The boy is magnificent. Top class header (with questionable keeping). Please end this Rooney-centric striker focus now Louis. For the sake of the team and to maximise our full attacking capabilities.

2911~~~
Wonderkid.

2912~~~
I take it back. Unreal header!

2913~~~
Goal drought over.

2914~~~
Origi would've been proud of that.

2915~~~
Love this lad.

2916~~~
Awesome.

2917~~~
Superb header from him.

2918~~~
He's amazing.

2919~~~
The French Pele.

2920~~~
Takes up a central position and scores. Why is he being played wide left? 

Brilliant header.

2921~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2922~~~
The club really got this one right. I'd have paid £100m for him if I knew he was this good.

2923~~~
The Black Pele.

2924~~~
Martial goal assisted by Valencia = the least smiley celebration for an equalising goal I've ever seen.

2925~~~
Clearly belongs to central attacking position. Probably just giving a rest to Memphis. Will be back to CF once Memphis is back.

#livinguptothepricetag

2926~~~
Nice to see him make up for his error, should be playing through the middle though I think their centre halves would have been delighted playing against Rooney instead.

2927~~~
Attacking 101 works after all.

2928~~~
Have you seen Pele lately?<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2929~~~
Well taken goal.

Need him in central areas. Not because he can't play out wide(he can), just he's a much better option than Rooney up top.

2930~~~
Good goal but he needed to make up for that nonsense in the first half.

2931~~~
Not much came off for him today but his technique in small areas amazes me. He reminds me so much of the Brazilian Ronaldo with his ball control.

2932~~~
he's good.

2933~~~
Which basically means, Pele.

2934~~~
The whole team struggled today but he looked like the one who could make something happen - and he did.

2935~~~
Can LVG fecking move him back up top.

2936~~~
Yeah, he's perfectly capable of slotting in out wide for us, but I see no reason for us to do so when he looks like our best option centrally at the moment. It'd be like us moving Rooney out wide in 2009/2010 since we'd just signed Michael Owen.

Granted, that's a bit of an exaggeration...but the general point applies.

2937~~~
Play him upfront ffs

2938~~~
Should play as a main striker.

2939~~~
Playing him on the left v Everton made a lot of sense. Playing him on the left tonight didn't.

2940~~~
What a player this kid is - wasted out wide tonight, but still scoring!<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2941~~~
The big problem for us is this:

-He'sd better than Memphis as a winger
-He's better than Rooney as a striker, but Rooney needs to play.

2942~~~
Memphis has been poor tbf

2943~~~
And, as a direct result of point two, putting him back upfront will result in Rooney pushed back onto the #10 and Ander benched.

2944~~~
I don't get the HT criticism of him. Rojo did feck all to support him in our attacking play, he was just passing him the ball and then immediately withdrawing without any reason whatsoever, leaving Martial against 2 or 3 CSKA players all the time. Even Messi would have struggled against that ffs.

At least Valencia tried to involve himself in our attacks. Rojo just left Martial against numerous opponents when it was his job to attack more after CSKA parked the bus.

Anyways, brilliant header from the lad. I'm glad he scored again and should be playing centrally for sure.

2945~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2946~~~
He was pretty poor today bar the goal, his handball was idiotic. If you're going to do that try not to wear neon orange fecking gloves <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Cracking goal though, keeps showing things nobody knew he had in his locker.

2947~~~
Or Herrera/Rooney out wide, with the other in the middle. Here's hoping.

2948~~~
Quite poor, Rooney is hardly pulling any trees either.

2949~~~
How about Rooney at left wing, surely that minimizes his effect on the team, especially if our fullback can push forward and provide some width?

2950~~~
He's better centrally there's no doubt about that IMO, but he again played his way into the game tonight, got a vital goal which was a cracking header and could have had a couple of assists.

2951~~~
Brilliant<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2952~~~
5 goals and an assist in 9 games. At 19, new to the league in a side struggling to create chances. Very impressive. All he needs to do is manage to get burgled and he's batted off all the excuses made for Di Maria.

2953~~~
Berbatov and C.Ronaldo after the Bulgarian's sick assist against West Ham.

Edit: Not an equalizing goal. My bad.

2954~~~
He had a torrid time on the left-wing with Rojo putting in one of the worst LB performances I think I've ever seen in a United shirt. Constantly 1 vs 2 and isolated. 

Much better on the right, once he had some proper support from his full-back.

2955~~~
I was thinking about that, but again people would say Martial managed to rip Coleman a new one at least twice while it was the same Rojo as LB (shit performance by him). I wonder if it was CSKA that used a different gameplan to make Martial look bad in the first half or it was Everton that were shit on Saturday. Anyway, he managed to score the goal when we needed it and salvaged a point; good stuff.

2956~~~

2957~~~
I love LvG, but he comes out with a lot of pigheaded, moronic statements at times.

2958~~~
Why? Martial and Valencia on either side were our only sources of width.

2959~~~
Even Jamie sees it too

2960~~~
Rojo hung him out to dry tonight. He didn't get on the overlap once in 70 minutes.

He tried things, most of it didn't come off, but that doesn't concern me. He was up against a good defender tonight yet got his goal in the end. His header was very, very clever.

2961~~~
Did anyone see the Philipe Auclair interview about him? Said he's developing incredibly quickly and only has one remaining weakness in his game. Heading the ball <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

2962~~~
Yeah that Fernandes fella was quality tonight. If he performs always like that, would could be a bargain for clubs.

2963~~~
Rojo was much more involved in our attacking play against Everton, it was his best game for us so far. Today he was hesitant in his attacking play and rubbish as a whole. There were some great overlaps on Saturday, so Martial was never isolated like he was today. Today he had to come up against 2 or 3 CSKA players and their fullback Fernandes had a good game, which only made things worse. It also seems like our gameplan for the first half was to pass it to Martial and see what happens. We really miss Shaw.

Everton never really parked the bus, which is also a huge difference to today. Martial had more space in the second half on Saturday as Everton were chasing the game, so he had time and space to destroy Coleman.

We really should be playing him as a striker, but Memphis needs to step up big time.

2964~~~
Officially passes Falcao's tally from last season..in 9 games.

2965~~~
Di Maria's as well.

2966~~~
His passing is a bit off at times tbf.

2967~~~
Took his goal well even if he got a bit lucky with it, thought the keeper changed his mind about diving half way through only to reach out again once it was in

2968~~~
Found it hard to take it seriously considering it pretty much started with him saying Cabaye and Sissoko are good options for their national side. Everyone who watches a bit French football knows there are better players than those for their midfield.

2969~~~
Officially passes Falcao's tally from last season..in 9 games.
Dont remember how many ADM got, but yes..very likely.

2970~~~
That was a good header though.

2971~~~
He said they'r both good players and France are spoilt for choice in central midfield. All of which I'd agree with.

2972~~~
That was one of 2 or 3 things that I wasn't sure if he had or thought he could improve, his heading. Though he's won plenty of aerial battles in the prem so far, he just hasn't really had any chances on his head. Took it brilliantly though. 

Think he can improve on his shooting from range and his passing, he's brilliant at just about everything else. He hasn't shot from range too much, but the few times he has they weren't too convincing. That's something that can definitely be improved upon though. As for his passing, it seems like it's just inconsistent which is absolutely normal for a young player. It's crazy to see how complete of a player he is at the age of 19 years though. Shrugged off a disappointing first half (a big part of it was due to Rojo not offering any support and CSKA doubling up on him and diving in every time he touched the ball), scored the goal and was a lot better overall in the second, especially with added support from his fullbacks instead of being isolated 1 v 2 at all times.

2973~~~
That's fair.

2974~~~
It certainly looks as his biggest weakeness, I think that the closer to the goal he will be the better for us, hence play him as no9 and bench Rooney ffs.. he can dribble his way to the goal so he doesn't need to shoot from range..

2975~~~
Was doubled up way too often and his decision making was uncharacteristically poor today. He was trying to force things mind you, as nothing much was happening in the final third and given his age, he is bound to have an iffy performance here and there. Extremely well-taken goal and a crucial one at that.

Really needs to be played centrally though - his movement off the ball, ability to turn markers and great hold-up play simply means he is our best striker at the moment. On the left, he just didn't have enough support from both his fellow forwards and Rojo, and it is much easier to nullify him as he just doesn't quite enjoy the same tactical freedom there, as he does in the lone centre-forward role.

2976~~~
The only shot from range I can remember him having was against Wolfsburg. To be fair, how often do we shoot from range as a team?

2977~~~
Had a bad first half when things weren't coming off for him and their right back was winning that battle, but he won us a valuable point in the end with a great header. Everyone knows he should be playing centre forward anyway.

2978~~~
For me, I think his passing is his only weakness. Seems pretty complete in every other area.

2979~~~
Gotta love that he never stopped trying stuff when it was going against him.

2980~~~
Thought he was rather poor apart from the great finish for our equalizer. I think he is wasted out wide and should be our number 9.

2981~~~
In the first half he seemed to play too much like a traditional winger hugging the touchline and this is why he was bad IMHO. I mean everyone is entitled to a very bad performance once in a while but the way he played (or was asked to play) was too restrictive. On the left he can do well but only if he has more freedom to roam around (his movement was good for the header) and also when his LB overlaps and creates space for him (which Rojo didn't do very much last night).
Would his performances as a striker be better for Utd ? Probably yes because he's a better player than the current Rooney but it doesn't mean he won't have tough matches there too.

2982~~~
I remember Phillipe Auclair saying his only real weakness is his heading <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

What a well taken goal.

We need to play him up top, he makes our entire team better playing there,

2983~~~
Play him up top and he will get us goals, plenty of them. He is half the player on a flank.

2984~~~
This.

We lack pace and the idea of getting in behind the defence with him out wide, he simply must start up front. The only issue is that then leaves Herrera and Rooney fighting for the ten role, given Rooney's form it shouldn't really be him, we all know it will be though.

2985~~~
I do think he is better to top, but it isn't by a lot. He's class on the wing as well, the only reason he struggled today at times was because he was constantly doubled up and Rojo gave him no support to give him a bit of space. He's our best winger and our best striker by a distance for both IMO.

2986~~~
He's a classy player.

He looks classy on the wing.

He looks classy up front.

The difference is that his final ball is quite poor when he's out wide. He offers little creativity and little goal threat from the wing. Put him in the middle and he gives a lot more substance to go with the style.

2987~~~
Redeemed himself with the goal after the handball in the first half, I think he's better as a 9 than out on the wing but he has played well there.

2988~~~
I don't mind him playing wide left on the face of it. He's good out there and is still dangerous.

What really annoys me about it is that he's there to shoe horn Rooney into the team.

2989~~~
He works hard, but defends like a striker.

2990~~~
he defended well against coleman in the everton game.

2991~~~
by staying up the pitch and attacking. Coleman didn't dare go past the halfway line for most of the game. CSKA got their tactics spot on against him. Fernandes would closely mark and Tosic would close in on him to double team when he had possession allowing either of them to break out. Tactically CSKA were brilliant last night.

2992~~~
Said it last week, but if you have a potentially top class centre-forward - especially in this day and age where they are getting rarer and rarer - you HAVE to play him there. So what if he CAN play wide? Everyone plays wide, there are so many long term options there - but no young centre forward like him in world football.

It is simply far more valuable to a team to have a world-class centre forward than other positions anyway, and Rooney is no goalscorer in any case.

2993~~~
But what happens to our beautiful Wayne though? He's not good enough to play on the wing and he HAS to play.

2994~~~
He should replace Shaw and take a full back spot. Or we can create a new position for him where he is assistant-goalkeeper or something. Just get him out of the way.

2995~~~
That's no surprise though. He should play upfront where he's excellent.

2996~~~
At the moment, unless Martial, Herrera or Mata do something I don't see us scoring much.

Better as a #9. 

I just wish we'd drop Rooney and move Martial infield.

2997~~~
It's painfully obvious how it's the solution. Louis needs to get his balls out and just drop Rooney. Drop him and Valencia and we're a very good team.

2998~~~
The problem with dropping Rooney right now is that we would be playing the even worse Memphis instead... Maybe just put Rooney on the left, its worth a try

2999~~~
Is young fit?

3000~~~
Nope

3001~~~
He's by far the best as a centre forward but still offers some quality out wide due to his exceptional talent. Players like that can play across the entire front line because their set of skills makes them versatile.

Still, there is significant difference between him as a centre forward as him on the wing. Someone like Benzema or Lewandowski would probably still be decent if they were shifted out wide because they are exceptionally talented footballers but their productivity would nowhere near the same.

3002~~~
I agree. The main issue is that we REALLY need his movement and holdup/linkup play as a CF if we are to continue with this posession style football. More so than we need him outwide.

3003~~~
Sign of a good player when he's not particularly having a good game but can pop and score/create a goal. 

I do think due to his age and experience he will have a dip in form eventually, we just need to stick with him.

3004~~~
His touch and composure is that of an accomplished 28 year old. His maturity is incredibly impressive. Normally teenage attacking players are all gung-ho, eager to impress and taking on too big of a task, but he looks a natural. The way he holds up the ball especially. He's not trying to turn everything into a highlight reel. He knows when to release the ball and when to try and evade the challenge. He's got a great head on his shoulders.

3005~~~
The only issue I see with Rooney on the left is that Mata/Rooney as wide men is a bit slow. 
However given our patient style of play it may not be such a bad option.

3006~~~
Hence, rather him at #9 than Rooney who works and defends like a coconut.

3007~~~
The only reason I can't give LVG too much aggro over Martial on the left is that Memphis cannot play for us with the what he has shown so far.

3008~~~
He's pretty much the only player in our team who can score out of nowhere with a brilliant move etc. We hoped Depay would be that player but Brugge game aside he hasn't turned up in that aspect at all and has refused to take any risks whatsoever.

Martial is a better centre forward than a winger and he's our best attacking player at the minute so we should work to utilize him in full.

3009~~~
I still can't believe how good he turned out to be <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3010~~~
Just think where we would be right now had me not splashed all that cash on this lad.... Dearry me

3011~~~
I kind of disagree tbh. Hes been poor, but he has been taking risks, Ive seen him trying tricks, taking players on etc. Mainly though it hasn't been coming off and his loose touch seems to be a big hinderence to him. I don't think we can say he hasn't been taking risks, but we can definately say he has been playing poorly

3012~~~
I wish we had 2 martials, we would really be flying then. 

I can't wait until Memphis hits full flight as those 2 combining could be electric. 

The sooner he gets into form the better IMO.

3013~~~
There are very few players who you would watch a team just to see them play but he is one of them. Kind of like how Ronaldo, Rooney and Cantona were in the past

3014~~~
Agreed. He's the first player I've been excited to watch since to ronaldo left. Hoping Memphis can get too that level too.

3015~~~
What a Fecking goal last night. It was like Ronnie O'Sullivan potting a ball into the corner with power. He had so much to do and he made it look easy. Incredible.

3016~~~
Thing is, with a good talking to Memphis might stop making so many mistakes. He's dribbling the ball too much.
Rooney however is ponderous and slow. you can't teach an old dog new tricks etc.

I'd give Memphis a game after he's had a good talking to. He's a good player, he's just in need of some guidance.

3017~~~
I agree. Its not the dribbling that was the issue with him. Vs Arsenal that was just a bad attitude and lack of professionalism and down right lazyness. He has been rightfully dropped, and until the lesson has been learnt he should remain dropped.
Also TBH his first touch is probably as bad if not worse than Rooneys

3018~~~
How long is Young out for? 

A Young-Herrera-Mata Combo with Martial leading the line would work for me for the majority of the season. I sweat when I think of what kind of state we would have been had we not signed this guy.

3019~~~
Sacrificing this boy out wide, just to fit Rooney into the team, is an absolute tragedy.

3020~~~
I kinda agree, but i'd prefer to keep the pressure off Martial as much as possible, plus i don't expect United to win the league this season no matter who plays or what system.

3021~~~
To be honest, I like the fact that we are playing him out wide (even though it might not be an intentional ploy), and this might even benefit him long term. Playing through the spine of the team carries an immense amount of responsibility, and although Martial is extremely mature for his age, no 19 year old should have to carry the burden for a club of United's stature. Let him play on the left and right wings instead of being the focal point of the attack, let him develop as a wide forward to add to his arsenal of skills as a lead striker for the future, let him make mistakes out wide (the kind that would be more heavily criticized and punished in central positions). 

There's no real hurry, he has a lot of growing up to do, and doing it in a position with lower responsibility will take the load off a bit. As the lone striker he'll be the center of the opposition defense's attention, his tactical freedom will be curtailed, and we won't get to explore the extent of his versatility. Even at Monaco, he was essentially playing as a left winger for most of the time, no it's not exactly alien terrain.

Kinda like what Simeone does with his young central midfielders Óliver, Koke and Saúl. Eases the burden on them while Gabi and Tiago are still around, gives them more freedom while also accounting for match experience, but they should be ready when the experienced ones hang up their boots or change clubs. Rooney starting as the #9 isn't the ideal situation, yes, but then again he'll stink it up wherever he plays. Even the likes of Benzema and Suarez played out wide on several occasions when they were Martial's age. And Robert Lewandowski often played as a wide forward when Lucas Barrios was the main man at Dortmund.

3022~~~
He didn't seem to mind the pressure when scoring against Liverpool or a brace against Southampton. Sometimes players are just ready, I don't think he feels the pressure as he plays consistently.

3023~~~
Rooney's stealing the position off him. So undeserved that Rooney gets that role.

3024~~~

3025~~~
Great post. Martial is so young, there is no urgency to see him as the number 9 at the moment despite how annoying and frustrating Rooney can be.

3026~~~
I agree in principle. However he is the best no9 at the club, and so he should really just play there tbh. He played outwide last season for Monaco.
If we had another top striker then I would agree, but for now, I'd rather see Rooney LW and Martial no9, we really need what he brings through the middle at the moment.

Martial likes this

3028~~~
He's 19. Still can't believe that.

3029~~~
They are bricking it every time he gets the ball. He just somehow gets the most out of every single situation. The difference between him and Memphis is huge, at this point.

3030~~~
Find off the season (regardless the price) what a player this kid is!

3031~~~
Best player on the pitch.

3032~~~
He's been looking dangerous. Has a real perseverance when he's dribbling with the ball, and doesn't give up easily when he loses it. Must be a bit of a nightmare to play against him, since he's hard to contain.

3033~~~
Absolutely wasted on the wing. The damage he could cause if he was up front

3034~~~
Dutch commentator said that whenever Martial gets the ball he just makes things happen compared to other attackers on the pitch today.

3035~~~
I don't understand how he keeps hold of the ball so regularly while riding tackle after tackle. The ball seems to ricochet around and come out at his feet every time. It happens way too consistently for it to be luck.

3036~~~
He's still doing a lot of good work out on the wing, and his dribbling ability means that he's able to take players on out there and succeed, so I wouldn't say he wasted. But still, I'd much rather see him centrally ahead of Rooney. Martial's looking like a more dangerous striker than Rooney at the moment without actually even being a striker.

3037~~~
He's just a brilliant player. Looks the likeliest to make something happen out of both teams

3038~~~
Need him up top to stretch the game. There is no space for us at the moment.

3039~~~
It's just a relief to have someone who is the best dribbler on the pitch in most games. Since Ronaldo left and Giggs adjusted his game we really missed that.

3040~~~
He gets more space on the wing so we are able to see his dribbling. I wouldn't say he would be as effective if played as a CF because we just don't pass the ball to our forwards enough

3041~~~
Just put him up front where he can hurt them. Phenomenal player

3042~~~
Oh I didn't mean he wasn't still class out there, he's still been our best player. I just think we would actually look like scoring if he was up front, City can't handle him.

3043~~~
Would like to see him running at Kompany (yellow card) and moved centrally.

3044~~~
Love this man hard.

3045~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

3046~~~
Best forward we have. Comfortably.

3047~~~
Looked like the best player on the pitch.

3048~~~
That ball into the box was delish

3049~~~
Still our best attacking player but he's wasted on the wing, get him back to #9 ffs.

3050~~~
This.

3051~~~
His output has been terrible since he has gone on the wings. Van Gaal needs to put him back upfront and so he can start scoring. I do not understand why Van Gaal is struggling with this simply concept.

3052~~~
He's invaluable to us because he can beat men even with no support. Our most threatening attacking player by far.

3053~~~
Master at holding the ball up under pressure and involving others.

3054~~~
My concern with him as a #9 is that he wouldn't see as much of the ball as he is doing at the minute on the wing. Especially as he would have to be replaced by Memphis or Young, who wouldn't provide as much as he is currently doing.

3055~~~
Was very good I thought.

3056~~~
Can we just play him up front ffs

3057~~~
What a fecking ball that was, incredible that he has even that in him.

3058~~~
If he plays as a false 9, he will see a lot of the ball like how Suarez plays for Barcelona or Liverpool in the past. On the wings, he has a lot of the ball but he is less influential in his output productivity because he has to use some of his energy to track back and help his fullback.

3059~~~
I wouldn't worry about it too much, since he's a player who's capable of dropping back and picking it up, before taking on players. He'd still get plenty of time on the ball because he's one of those players who has the ability to just forcefully involve himself.

3060~~~
Our best attacking player. If we had 2 Martials, we'd be in business.

We need to bring in a versatile attacker that can play out wide and beat a man, so Martial plays up top.

3061~~~
He would see much more of the ball in areas where he is most effective which is all that should matter.

3062~~~
It doesn't matter where he plays because there is always going to be a problem of playing either Rooney or Memphis (two average players at the moment). The most important thing is to give him the ball and support him when he has it and that is on the wing or up front. Just because he'll play up front doesn't mean he'll automatically bang them in.

3063~~~
Am I the only one that thought it should have been obvious to a 5th grader that Martial needed to be moved centrally for the last 25 mins?

3064~~~
Get Rooney out of this side and Martial up front. The difference he makes to our attacking game is huge.

3065~~~
Realistically, the only hope we have is an injury to Rooney to see the best out of Martial. He'd thrive with Memphis, Herrera and Mata in behind him.

3066~~~
It is absolutely mind-blowing that LVG puts him on the wing with the form Rooney is in. 

Infuriating.

3067~~~
He plays wide to accommodate Rooney it's not rocket science. Depay has been poor and still settling so LVG uses his best options.

3068~~~
Most talented player on the pitch by a distance (saying something when there's Mata, De Bruyne, Sterling, Toure, Schweinsteiger and Rooney on there). Incredible how he's such a good player despite being just 19. He's brilliant on the wing, but up front he's even better probably (though there really isn't that much between that). The biggest difference is our back up on the wing is Memphis/Young, who can both be excellent players, and up top it's Rooney, who is pretty clearly past it at this point.

3069~~~
He is already so good. I know he is very young and maybe it is too early to call him world class but he does show some world class things almost every game. He dribbles past players like they arent there and that pass towards Lingard really was world class.

3070~~~
Prior to CSKA I thought heading was his weakness and he scored a header, this week I thought his passing wasn't up there and he provided some beauties.

3071~~~
Would be great to see Martial in front of Herrera with Young or Depay on the wing.

3072~~~
It really is infuriating to see him on the wing.

3073~~~
I don't think comparing us to Suarez at Barcelona or Liverpool is relevant, because our style of play is so different. Whatever you think of Rooney you can't deny that he sees less of the ball than Suarez did at either of those clubs. LVG's style works this way and I'm convinced that's part of the reason every single striker we've tried as looked isolated and poor.

3074~~~
By far our best attacking outlet which, to reiterate all that has been said before, is shocking really. I hope he's played as a 9 with Fellaini or Pereira or even Mata behind him on Wednesday, tear Boro apart and show LVG what plan A should always be.

3075~~~
I understand that and I have criticized Van Gaal for that decision. Nevertheless, even though Depay has been average, I still rather have him in our team over Rooney who has been piss poor for a player who seems to be our star man.

3076~~~
Another great display, I love how he ghosts past even the best of defenders. He should not be out wide though, he should have been running directly at that City defence instead of the shite we seen yet again from Rooney up there.

3077~~~
Another game another good performance.

3078~~~
Imagine what he could achieve when playing upfront...? 

Good to see him being thrown out wide to cater for Captain fantastic.

3079~~~
What a talent. Playing on the left by himself without much support from Rojo and yet gave Sagna a hard time.

3080~~~
The two genuine weaknesses he has are crossing and striking from range. Hopefully he can improve on the former but the latter is just a part of his game I doubt he'll ever have. Not enough power in that right foot of his.

3081~~~
Martial this season when he started upfront was more productive and saw a good amount of the ball. If a player is performing well, regardless of his position our other teammate will try and find him because they know he is capable of making things happen. Playing him in the role aforementioned by me, will guarantee more attacking influence because he is not being played as an out and out striker.

3082~~~
Every single striker except Martial, you mean. Temperamentally and tactically Martial is much more suited I playing the lone striker role than Rooney. He plays in moments, doesn't need constant involvement on the ball to stay on top of his game and his hold-up play and ability to stretch teams in behind gives our attack a completely different dimension. That's wasted out wide. I sympathise with LvG because we do need someone who can dribble out wide with Mata on the opposite wing, and that's been Memphis' biggest problem so far. He just hasn't offered that. 

Still, playing our best attacker in his best position should be a no brainer and Martial is obviously that.

3083~~~
If he pays me enough, I will take Rooney out for him.

3084~~~
What i find most impressing here is how consistent he is. Young players usually have a lot of ups and downs, but he puts in one great shift after the other

3085~~~
Could just be his striking technique from distance that affects power.

I thought Messi in his younger days was poor at striking from range, but then he got much better at it.

3086~~~
Just imagine if we hadnt signed him and had gone with Rooney and co in attack all season...I shudder

3087~~~
The kid is too good, always dangerous. That's invaluable as either he will do something or teams will put more focus / players on him which should give space to our other attackers.

3088~~~
I feel sick just thinking of it.

3089~~~
Rooney is not worthy of being called his teammate. It's a travesty.

3090~~~
He's like the fecking Bat Signal shining hope over Old Trafford. He's very good on the left but I can't help but think how much better we'd be with him as the #9.

3091~~~
Man its soo frustrating having him on the left. Play him upfront FFS

3092~~~
I voted him MOTM. He was the only player who looked like doing something and tried to beat a man. It's ridicolous that he's pushed out to the left. I understood it against Everton when he helped deal with Colman (Rooney wouldn't have) but we're playing at home against a weakened rival. Why not go for it?

3093~~~
I don't think his level of performance really changes with him up front or on the wing. He's a brilliant player either way. The difference is our back up for the 2 positions... I'd take Young over current Rooney any day, and we'd look very threatening and have loads of pace. Memphis if he got his confidence back and once he gets used to the league as well. But Martial is clearly one of those top players for us. Like Aguero is for City, Hazard for Chelsea and Sanchez is for Arsenal. He's brilliant.

3094~~~
I think he's also brilliant on the left. Get a functioning striker into the side and Martial would be even more devastating. Brilliant player!

3095~~~
it's not frustrating playing him on the left, he's doing really well there. The frustrating thing is that we have a useless palyer up front who needs to strat everygame. 

I can imagine Harry Kane up front and Martial playing as left striker, that would have been brilliant set up...

3096~~~
He is real quality even on the wing. But I prefer him leading our attack line, as he is by far our best attacking player on the front.

3097~~~
Apart from Messi, I can't ever remember a 19 year old with the ability to beat a man so easily.

3098~~~
Not really. As good as he is as a 9, we would be wasting all his directness playing him there. I won't talk about Rooney, though, I'm trying not to.

3099~~~
It's not about his performance, I agree he is still playing well, but the team would be much better with him as the #9, we could stick Young, Lingard, Memphis etc....on the left and put him central and be a better team, as his touch, hold up play, pace, runs and dribbling as much better than Rooney's.

3100~~~
Depay has just been as frustrating as Rooney in many matches this season.

3101~~~
But he is young, I feel that it's better to trust and support Memphis than wasting game time on Rooney.

3102~~~
Thats what I mean. He has been great on the left he is doing the job. But knowing that he could be doing that in the centre of the field is frustrating. Just seems wasted.

3103~~~
Looks like a player doesnt he?

3104~~~
I feels the scale of being frustrative weighs more heavily on Rooney this season. Depay looked great in some matches, particularly the champion league, while I m struggling to find a game this season where Rooney was more than Average. I would even call his Hat trick against Brugge, an anomaly because I said that after the match; we played a poor side and he was not going to kick on from that despite some pundits claiming that you should not write of Rooney.

3105~~~
There are moments when you take your eye off him because he appears to have lost the ball (or be in the process of doing so) and you look at the surrounding opposing players to see if a break is on, only to flick back to Martial who has miraculously managed to not only keep the ball but somehow beat a man or two without really changing his direction. Its freaky good but done in such an understated fashion and although I've seen better dribblers I have never seen anyone do it quite like Martial.

3106~~~
True, I'd drop both and play Young , and bring someone in January.

3107~~~
A brilliant player, has probably put in at least a 7/10 performance for every game he has been here. Basically no-one else in our attack is on his wavelength, especially not Rooney

3108~~~
Love him, City have some really top players and they couldn't handle his ability. In a couple of years he's going to be a true superstar.

3109~~~
Agree was sayin the same to my lad. It was like his goal against Liverpool, looked like he rode his luck but he keeps doing it!!! It's almost like his feet react so quickly even when the players thinks he's got a piece of the ball. It's really freaky!!!

3110~~~
We haven't had someone like him since Ronaldo. Every time he gets the ball you expect something to happen.

3111~~~
He did this brilliant little flick to Schweinsteiger when he had two men on him and seemingly nowhere to go. He's honestly amazed me with the way he's started here, if we can get Memphis back into form so he can play as a striker we will be all right this season.

3112~~~
Ronaldinho at 19 was a cracking talent too.

3113~~~
By far our most threatining player today and in general since he joined us. Amazing talent, just a pleasure to watch everytime he picks up the ball. Quick feet, great hold up play, trying to take players on as often as possible, good vision, calm personality - he got it all. Hopefully the rest of our offensive department starts to perform properly soon, so we can get the best out of him.

3114~~~
Can bot believe how good he is. Fantastic player. Just hope we can get the right players around him.

3115~~~
When he reaches his peak he could be phenomenal. The way he was going past City's players was ridiculous at times.

3116~~~
You will take him out in the form of...<i>martial </i>arts!

3117~~~
Was excellent today. The strength he shows is outstanding, and he fights for everything.
The beauty of watching him out wide is that he gets the opportunity to receive the ball, turn, and run at defenders. He causes problems, and got two players booked today.

I really want to see more of him through the middle though, my only worry with that is, that he won't have the chances to run at defenders as much, as we move the ball quite slowly, so it compacts the middle of the field.

For a teenager, he is showing exceptional talent

3118~~~
For the love of God, let him play up front with Herrera behind him; that's all there is to say.

3119~~~
it's sad that we're shifting him to the wing in order to shoehorn a clearly out of form/past it player up front.

3120~~~
I'm hoping he gets a rest sometime soon. He is our only useful striker (and our only decent LW, as it happens). We need him for the whole season.

EDIT: Of couse, he was fantastic today. Class above the 21 other players on the pitch.

3121~~~
I think once young is back. He should move to the middle. Young is the only other player we have that can run at fullbacks and escape them. It makes sense to have him out there at the moment as no one else can do what he's doing out there and its an important job. Out wide he can use his pace and trickery to beat a man and get more involved in the game than if he were in the middle. Taking him away from there to go upfront leaves us with no one of that ilk until young is fully fit. Memphis is not bad at it but is clearly out of form and not nearly as disciplined when we are without the ball.

3122~~~

3123~~~
He is like Berbatov but can actually get past players.

3124~~~
So nothing like Berbatov at all?

3125~~~
Pretty much.

3126~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

3127~~~
He needs to play upfront. He's so much better then Rooney its almost embarrassing.

3128~~~
He is ridicilously good, what the hell.

3129~~~
One thing that's making me so happy about him as well is the fact he seemingly loves United too.

Turning down other teams, notably more money from Chelsea to join United.

Could we actually have a player who becomes world class who stays?

3130~~~
The way he just glides past defenders is incredible, looks like a young Torres.

3131~~~
At this rate we'll finally have a player other than De Gea winning our POTY <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Could easily win the Premier League Young POTY too.

3132~~~
agreed. as I've said earlier in this thread that martial being shoehorned at LW to accommodate a clearly out of form/past it rooney is sad to see.

3133~~~
This is a really good point.

Rooney has been poor, but the service into him has been poor as well. Martial is getting plenty of touches and plenty of quality service on the wing. It would be a shame to put Martial centrally and have him isolated due to our possession first play it safe philosophy.

3134~~~
Must be said all the talk and rumours circulating over the next few weeks indicate we'll be going for Kane (obviously nothing concrete or anything) and Mane too, those two plus Mata/Herrera/Depay/Martial open up an enormous amount of combinations for us for next year.

3135~~~
our only attacking player that got something special in his game, the way he glides past players, his vision etc.

shame rooney is off form/past peak at this moment.

3136~~~
He needs to play as no.9. What is it going to take for LVG to drop Rooney. FFS I am tired of it now! Martial will make things happen if he plays up front. He is already doing so much more cutting in from left.

3137~~~
Him and Berba had a very good understanding.

3138~~~
If our #9 is as good as him, we will win the premiership.

3139~~~
Didn't he also play the ball into Lingard who went on to hit the bar?

3140~~~
Yeah he did

3141~~~
Yeah, he did. Creative stuff it was.

3142~~~
He's way ahead of everyone for young player of the year so far. Shaw is the one who could have challenged him, such a shame he got injured <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3143~~~
It's a shame that he has to play on the left because of 'you know who'. 
Louis should do what Fergie did with Ronaldo, build a team around this kid, give him the free role. Martial is that good and can become something special.

3144~~~
He is becoming a phenomenal player indeed. His dribbling reminds me a lot of Suarez tbh. Even if he is playing LW, I would like him to move infield more and try to get into the box often instead of hugging the touchline. If it needs to be, then I would drop Mata and play Lingard to offer more width on the right wing to compensate.

3145~~~
I just wish we played through him more. It seems like 80% of the play goes through the middle and the right and that we don't do him justice really. Whenever he touched the ball he were dangerous and actively breaking the opponents down and creating stuff. Just wish he was our focal point centrally instead of Rooney, so he would be involved with the play on both sides more.

3146~~~
I saw that again on tv and boy ... was that a flick or chip

3147~~~
He's becoming the only exciting reason to watch United these days...

3148~~~
It's only a matter of time before he's back as a #9 for us. With Young back, Memphis needing games and hopefully bound to regain some form eventually, Martial will be back as a striker for us with Rooney dropping deeper. We might bring someone like Mane in January as well. I think it's quite certain that we'll bring a wide player either in January or next summer.

I think Van Gaal knows that Martial is better as a striker, but had to play him on the left because of circumstances such as Young's injury and Memphis's form. He's great out wide, but most of the times he's far from the goal hugging the touchline, and we have no one in the box. There was a moment yesterday when Rojo crossed the ball into their box, but there wasn't anyone on the receiving end despite it being a great cross. 

Yes, he has great technique, but he is also a very composed finisher and doesn't get bullied by the CB's. It's not like he doesn't get the chance to run at the opposition when he's playing up top. He constantly drifts out wide on the left. That's how he scored against Liverpool after all. 

We should sign someone like Mane or Bale or if we sign a striker, it should be someone like Aubameyang so that he and Martial could interchange positions.

3149~~~
First game I've watched of you lot all season (just match of the day till now)

He was fantastic - why on earth is he being wasted on the left?  I know the answer - I just can't believe LVG wouldn't move it about to do it.  Just seems so simple?!

3150~~~
feck the Henry comparisons,  Henry wasn't half as good at the same age!

3151~~~
We have no one to play on the left, it's easy to say "drop Rooney" but the attacking midfielders aren't pulling any trees, benching Rooney for someone who isn't clearly better will cause problems. It would be easier if Young or Memphis were available or in form.

3152~~~
I would like him to shoot. so many times he opens up space with his dribbling bit always looks for a team mate. He's too unselfish imo.

3153~~~
His ball retention and dribbling is simply stunning. Brilliant talent.

3154~~~
Martial would create his own chances unlike Wayne these days.

3155~~~
It's because his shooting isn't still at the same level of his dribbling and running. He doesn't trust himself yet to hit the target.

3156~~~
We miss is skill set in the striker role. Being able to hit your striker with a pass and have it stick or him able to spin in behind in one movement is invaluable when you have a lone striker. 

We pass to our current striker, he receives the ball and then his second touch is seemingly always a tackle! No wonder we don't look like scoring for large parts of the game.

3157~~~
Turning out to be the best bit of business we've done in years.  We'd be completely fecked without him.

3158~~~
I think you mean 'comparisons'.

Compartments is something totally different.

3159~~~
I did mean that, dunno how I managed to type a completely different word.. still drunk from last night this morning <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3160~~~
no problem <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

3161~~~
Predictive text?

3162~~~
That move where he bamboozle 2 City players with a flick to his own standing leg needs a gif. Somebody make it happen

3163~~~
His crossing is really shite though. Delivered some stinkers into the box yesterday.

3164~~~
That's because he's a striker and not a winger <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3165~~~
We miss him upfront so badly.

3166~~~
We need two of him. One on the left wing and one at striker. Possibly one at right wing aswel

3167~~~
So many didn't even beat the first man.

3168~~~
Not really. He is both.

3169~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-e1eo_mNSHU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

He should have had 3 more assists too. Rooney twice (Everton and Wolfsburg) and Memphis (Sunderland).

3170~~~
Sad truth.

3171~~~
Have people in the office asking why he's not playing more centrally<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/> Didn't know I looked like LVG<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>
What can you say when it's so obvious he should be playing there for us? It was depressing tbh

3172~~~
It's not like he's being Welbeck'd out wide to be a workhorse.

He has bags of talent and it's actually pretty good to see him in a position where he gets a lot of freedom and a lot of touches of the ball, one of our only players that can beat opposition players, that's why I don't mind him there. It's just so pleasing to watch him glide his way in from that left wing spot.

Honestly wouldn't mind him alternating positions as Left-Forward and #9 Position this season, we've got him for a very long time and it's a good trade for him to learn as we ease him in to that #9 position as his natural role. Sooner or later Memphis will get a spell again and that would mean Martial will be up top.

3173~~~
I wouldn't say he is wasted out wide myself, but I do think his skill set could be better utilised up front, esp in our team. If our team had other dynamic forwards who could capitalise on the attention that Martial is receiving, then Martial out wide could thrive, as would the team of course. However, it is easier to pin him down and double up on him out left in our team, frequently meaning he has to beat more than one marker. If we had a fluid front trio with  pacy and direct players like Benzema or a Ronaldo alongside him, then it wouldn't really be a problem.

As it stands, in a triumvirate with Rooney and Mata, he will have greater room to manoeuvre up front - having the freedom to drop onto either flank or drop deeper - and his impressive ability to turn markers tight to him, and his excellent hold-up ability would guarantee a higher rate of success than him frequently trying to dribble past 2 players out left.

3174~~~
This isn't so much about Martial but rather about people wanting Rooney dropped until he's performing. I think Martial offers a lot on the wing too and he's got the movement to get into the box still. I think LVG should have given Wilson a run out against Everton especially as their high line would have given him a real chance to grab himself a goal. Hopefully he keeps progressing  as he is because he's doing great. I wouldn't worry about him being the one to watch at the minute. I think we're doing as well as you'd expect and baring the odd game here and there - defensively we're looking pretty good. 

Martial is doing really well and that's the main thing. LVG is still sculpting the squad and Memphis, Lingard, Wilson etc will hopefully be watching this kid and how he's taking responsibility so early on in his United career.

3175~~~
Agree with that, while I think Welbeck was very good for us from the wing, Martial offers a bit more as his dribbling is better and I think he can produce from the left as well. Left forward is the position he can benefit form for many years to come even if he ends up as no9..

3176~~~
almost like he's also on the mic of that track in the vid, fits really well.

Top buy with Schneiderlin

3177~~~
Can we just activate that 'plus 1' bollocks on his contract now and save ourselves any future bother?

3178~~~
Jesus, think if he scores now, he might start up front on the weekend!

Edit: Felli up front, never mind!

3179~~~
The only player in our team that generates any real excitement.

3180~~~
To put a positive spin on Martial not being played up front....there would be a lot of pressure on him there and it may be a good thing in the long run easing him in.

3181~~~
Pants today out wide. Doing all the same things Depay is getting slaughtered for and yet somehow he'll come out smelling of roses. 

No idea when LvG will realise he's wasted out wide, just runs into trouble or beats a man down the outside and hits the first defender with his cross.

3182~~~
If Martial was pants for 6-7 games in a row he'd start getting stick as well.

3183~~~
And yet there is a 3 point difference between their match ratings on the caf today.

3184~~~
I think the penny has dropped for LVG and he'll be played centrally from now on.

3185~~~
at least he tried and did beat the first man. he tried after that to slot a ball across in tight spaces and just missed another diving header. he beat more men in the time he was on than memphis has all year.

3186~~~
He shows so much quality everytime he touches the ball, just a joy to watch.

3187~~~
He beat him down the outside, exactly the same as Depay cutting in except it looks a bit more stylish. Still offers nothing in an attacking sense.

3188~~~
Comparing him to Depay is mental.

3189~~~
Is it possible to get Pep Guardiola next season, so we can have a manager who could develop this lad into a ballon D'or winner? I am tired of Van Gaal playing him outwide for Rooney. I went through this assessment with Welbeck before and playing Martial out wide will not help him develop his overall game in the longrun. If he is going to be a striker in the future, play him and develop him their.

3190~~~
How is it the same? Getting in behind the defender is a threatening position. Depay was cutting in but wasn't getting any luck doing so. I'd much rather see Martial central though.

3191~~~
he moves with the ball so much better than does memphis . not even close in application. he may not have scored but he had the balls to take a man on and beat him. that in itself makes him more dangerous. maybe it didn't come off tonight but he'll do fine. memphis looks a million miles away.

3192~~~
He seems way too dependant on his left foot, always cutting to the outside of the defender. He's becoming more predictable.

3193~~~
The bright light.

3194~~~
Memphis dreams of beating players the way Martial does.

Martial out wide isn't a problem. It's a problem when he's put there to accommodate Rooney up top.

3195~~~
Imagine how bad we'd be to watch this season if we hadn't wrapped this deal up at the last minute. We need 2 more attackers of his ability and profile.

3196~~~
He gets down the outside, not behind him. Crossing from the byline into the first man is just as bad as if you've cut inside, it just looks better. 

He did absolutely feck all today and somehow seems to be the highest rated player in the team.

3197~~~
I could have sworn he got properly behind his defender a couple of times but I'll admit I wasn't 100% focused towards the end so could be mistaken.

3198~~~
It really shits me up how close we were to having a strikeforce of Rooney, Fellaini and Wilson.

I mean, holy fecking shit. Thank god Martial ended up being absolutely brilliant, though admittedly he didn't really do much today.

3199~~~
Really needs to prove himself on the left wing before I would consider using him as a striker.

3200~~~
It's crazy how much we are relying him to come up with something in attack, I hope we don't run him to the ground like Liverpool did with Owen.

3201~~~
He made a name for himself on the left for Monaco and has been great for us in the last few games there. Destroyed Coleman, scored a vital goal against CSKA and created all sorts of problems for City's defense last Sunday. Just because he didn't really get into the game on the left in the last 20 minutes tonight means feck all. He grew into the game as a striker in extra time and was unlucky not to score. Once again created a chance out of nothing with a brilliant turn inside the box. 

Why the feck would he need to prove himself out wide in order to play up front anyway? Makes no sense.

3202~~~
Why? If he proves himself on the wing, wouldn't you use him as a winger? You play the player in the position that he is, the strikers position isn't some prize that he has to earn through playing on the wing.

3203~~~
Yep, the thought of Martial not being in this team at the moment is a strange one considering how influential he's becoming to our attack.

3204~~~
One of the stupidest posts I've seen

3205~~~
Try reading it out loud in a Dutch accent.

3206~~~
I agree. Griezmann + another one.

3207~~~

Imagine how bad we'd be to watch this season if we hadn't wrapped this deal up at the last minute. We need <b>2 more attackers</b> of his ability and profile.

Singing more attacking talent to compensate for a cautious manager is not the answer, let's hope Martial gets the manager he deserves to unleash him properly.

3208~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3209~~~
Martial alone wont be enough.

3210~~~

3211~~~
You cannot be serious. I actually hate it when posters gang up on a player and trash him(like they did in the match thread against Menphis) but going by performances even today, MArtial played a lot better. Memphis was actually pretty bad(still no need for the vitriol which were being spouted in the match thread about him) and Martial looked a lot better than Memphis when he came on.

Like some have already pointed out, Anthony did beat his man couples of time, it just things after that didn't happen sometimes. He's deservedly being ranked higher than Memphis, nothing controversial there

3212~~~
That was brilliant from him. He's great on the left (except for those 20 minutes yesterday), but his place is in the #9 position without a doubt.

3213~~~
By 3 points? For a player that didn't actually do anything in the game but give the ball away and run into trouble when he came on? Pull the other one.

3214~~~
That the spark of acceleration is something United needs up front! He needs to play up front.

3215~~~
People have been drooling over that clip on Twitter too and I don't really get it. He ran up a blind alley and got crowded out without playing a hurtful pass or getting a shot on target. He's made much more effective and damaging runs starting off from the left wing, that's for sure.

3216~~~
He beat three men, only to be foiled by a brilliant block by Ayala. Can you imagine if Rooney did that? Maybe 10 years ago.

3217~~~
You being a little harsh tbh, its not much to drool over. However he gets the ball into feet, holds off the defender, turns runs directly for goal, shows some good footwork not to get tackled. He didnt get his head up when he should have realised the defenders had him covered, should have just laid the ball off to Pereira there and he could have got it into the big fella.

I think the point about the clip, is showing how much potential he has, that was good defending by Boro there, however given that exact same scenario again, he could have got a shot in at goal and scored a great goal.

For me this is refreshing in his play, very different from what we usually see a striker do.

3218~~~
The first touch with his back to goal and the spin is the most impressive part. Hopefully Van Gaal puts him back central.

3219~~~
The bit where he rolls the ball under his feet to alude one defender, then plays it between the two was also impressive. It was however good defending in the end from Boro (alot of cover)

3220~~~
Good defending and a heavy touch from Martial. I think he's a fantastic talent and am delighted we signed him but don't get the hooplah over that specific incident. If Welbeck did something similar for Arsenal everyone would be taking the piss out of him for running with his head down and falling over when he tried to shoot.

3221~~~
Wrongly

EDIT: BTW I don't believe the touch was heavy, looks like he intended to burst away from the defender with the touch and get the shot away, however the defender did well and also got good cover. 

Like I said it wasn't anything to drool about, but it was very positive play, something we need to see more of from a United 9

3222~~~
The touch was not heavy imo. Just good defending. Also not going to really be able to beat 3 or 4 defenders inside the box unless you are Messi. He did well to beat the first 2-3 defenders. Again to dependent on him.

3223~~~
Best player so far again today, the ball to Rooney was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3224~~~
The run by Rooney was also brilliant. Shame he wasn't decisive enough to finish it, would've been a great sequence.

3225~~~
Honestly. Is is just me or does Martial seem to be playing really deep.

3226~~~
Needs to get into the box when we have the ball on the other wing

3227~~~
I like him from the wide. If we had a half decent striker he would have an assist, plus a rather unexpected Herrera miss. 

Would still prefer him on the top but I suppose we have to get used to it.

3228~~~

3229~~~
Thanks, where'd you find this if you don't mind me asking?

3230~~~
Whoscored. There is a heatmap section in the Match Center.

3231~~~
Oh, cheers.

3232~~~
Was by far his worst game for us... Every time he dribbled past them, they just brought him down so he couldn't do anything. Still created the chances for Herrera and Rooney so could've had a couple of assists on another day, but was a meh performance.

No surprise though as it's impossible to do anything when the rest of the team is insistent on not going forward and creating anything. Fecking Messi and Ronaldo would struggle in the way we play, even if we had both of them.

3233~~~
Good performance again I thought. Poor fecking lad though. Has to carry our whole attack. Form our right hand side with Mata and Darmian there is absolutely zero coming. Nothing. Rooney up front can't move or control a football to save his life, so it's pretty much up to a 19 year old to carry our attack.

3234~~~
How long before he gets sick of playing in this crap system

3235~~~
One man show in the attack for United. Should have had two assist today.

3236~~~
Carrying our attack by himself.

3237~~~
He's the only real threat we have in attack right now, ridiculous given he is only 19 and in a new league.

3238~~~
Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass.....

feck it, lets just give it Martial and expect him to take on the whole team!

3239~~~
The whole onus of the attack is on this kid. He is our Robben; if he doesn't fire, we are fecked.

3240~~~
This kid is so ridicilously good, carrying United's offense on his own.

3241~~~
It's funny how the whole team just fanny around passing sideways and backwards until it reaches martial, then he suddenly just bursts forward and runs passed his defender. 

If only we had 2 other of him for the striker and rw position we would probably win the CL <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3242~~~
Probably the biggest indictment of LVG is that for all the money we spent,  we would be fecked without him.

3243~~~
He created two excellent chances and the full back he was up against had to be switched off of him at half time because he was a foul away from a second yellow card. 

He can't be expected to do much more all on his own surely.

3244~~~
That pass he played to Rooney was superb. 

He's our only attacking threat in the final 3rd. It's a shame we depend so much on him. Imagine how badly we'd look without him? I shudder.

3249~~~
Hes the sole enjoyment I get out of watching United these days. That pass for Rooney deserved so much better...

3250~~~
It is a joke that after the brilliant performances he had for United in the center, our manager has decided to shift him out wide. I do not understand the logic in that. Such decision in particular when the alternative has been below average should be a sackable offense if I m being hyperbolic.

3251~~~
Could have been worse...could have joined Chelsea <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

Pretty much this. He's the only player we have that you'd pay money to watch.

3252~~~
Some of the passes he has made so far have been <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>.

3253~~~
Thought he gave the ball away a little too much at times. He also showed really good signs too though.

3254~~~
He's the only dangerous player we have and we chuck him out on the wing.

3255~~~
He's a bit unlucky on the assists stats. By now he should have at least 4 or 5 more assists to his name. He's put some absolute sitters for players to finnish off yet nothing came off(Ronney vs Wolfsburg, vs Everton, vs Palace, Herrera vs Palace, Memphis vs Sunderland) and some other I probably can't remember. Those chances were absolute sitters waiting to be bury and would have been on other days.

3256~~~
I wonder how he feels about United's other offensive players. He came to United as " that 19 year old unproven kid with a price tag of 50 million " and he immediately outperforms everybody. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3257~~~
Putting him on the wings is hurting us since we need his goals and he is lethal in the box plus his hold up play is far better than Rooney's.
But it is excellent that he can do both, his dribbling is very impressive. Definitely our best attacking player by a mile.

3258~~~
He is 19. amazing.

3259~~~
I love the way when he's in the box he pulls to 1 side and isolates a CB with his back to them, then receives the ball to feet while holding them off, and will quickly turn or lay it off to a runner.

He's absolutely fantastic at holding the ball, for a guy his size it's very impressive. The fact he can then turn with little touches of the ball makes him very difficult to mark - something we haven't utilised enough recently.

3260~~~
He's got the 'softest feet' of any player I've seen at United, including Berbatov and Di Maria.

45% pass completion yesterday was pretty shit, though.

3261~~~
That's an area of his game he will have to improve with time. He played a beautifully-weighted ball to Rooney, but he does misplace some fairly easy passes. I think that's the inconsistency of youth. 

His feet are incredible, and he's a wonderful prospect. We need to get rid of Van Gaal and Rooney, put Martial up top, buy a top winger and a backup striker. I think Memphis and Mata will do much better under another manager, especially if we could somehow get Guardiola. We'll always be turgid under Van Gaal though.

3262~~~
Jeebus. Think that might be a record.

3263~~~
He would be good on the left if we had Scholes to supply him with inch perfect cross field balls on his chest like Valencia and Nani in 2009 and 2010.

But we don't have Scholes. So start him as striker.

3264~~~
So that through pass to Rooney was technically Martial's fault. I guess its true his team mates actually are letting him down <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3265~~~
Whoscored counted that as a successfully completed pass.

3266~~~
Exactly what I feel too. In a team devoid of excitement, Martial has been a blessing.

3267~~~
Interesting comments from Pardew after the game.

Alan Pardew was reluctant to get too involved in the analysis of United’s current attacking concept, but in outlining how Crystal Palace set about their preparations for this game, he shone a fascinating light on the Rooney-Martial conundrum. Louis van Gaal continues to prefer the United captain up front, with the French teenager back in the position where he spent most of his apprenticeship in France after such an eventful opening salvo as the centrepiece of United’s frontline. But Pardew was clear about the danger Palace were most concerned about. <b>“We didn’t give Martial an inch today,”</b> assessed the Palace manager. <b>“Not an inch. It was a big target for us to stop him and we felt if we could stop him, we could stop their creative angle. When you take into account his age, that’s some recommendation, by the way. Our analysis is much greater than it has ever been. Our information is much greater so to protect ourselves against the top players, we have greater awareness. I have to say he is an impressive young player. I think he handled himself very well because he would have felt our presence around him and still he had moments in the game. The Man United manager will have to be very, very careful I think to keep his exuberance there because we were looking to stop him, I make no bones about that.”</b> It all seemed to add to the case for Martial to be given more game time in the middle.

3268~~~
Interesting but expected really. Everyone but van Gaal and Co can see that he is our best attacker atm and should be played centrally.

3269~~~
Which gives more fuel to the fire that either LvG is deluded or his hands are tied.

3270~~~
I've said this before , but man, Imagine if we didnt sign him..we'd be properly screwed now.

3271~~~
Although not exactly the same, I remember thinking the similarly about Adnan in the Moyes year. He was also playing so much better than any of our other attacking players and felt he was carrying the team for a bit.

It's a shame that Adnan's gone back a bit since then, but it's one of the reasons I have faith both Martial and Januzaj will come good. Both have shown form when others haven't.

3272~~~
I find this sad and incredibly unacceptable.

3273~~~
certainly looked that way, they were hounding him and doubling up, still sliced them open with that pass. So teams already acknowledge him our biggest threat even stuck out wide

3274~~~
When you're relying on a 19 year old to create and score goals you have problems.

But please play him up fecking front!

3275~~~
Yeah you can tell teams have already started to double up on him, amazing really. Yet he's still managing to produce key moments each game. Shame he is doing everything on his own.

3276~~~
We aren't helping him enough either considering Rojo rarely overlaps to give him space, or the right wing doesn't take advantage of the extra space.

3277~~~
its pissing me off watching this guy on the wing when he could become our best striker in years. we have such a talent on our books and we are doing our best to waste him.

3278~~~
<b>Manchester United</b> manager Louis van Gaal admits he doesn't know what <b>Anthony Martial's </b>best position is yet.

The 19-year-old French international has scored five times for the Reds, but has found himself playing out left in recent games with Wayne Rooney up front, something that has frustrated the club's supporters.

The Dutchman said: "He played always in Monaco as a left winger and I have to see what is the best balance in the team. We have played him in the striker's position, but in Monaco he played more or less at the left-wing."

<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> sooooo the no9 is no longer really considered a no9?

EDIT: Does this guy ever know anyones best position?

Rooney, ADM, Herrera, Mata, Januzaj, etc etc etc

3279~~~
In what way?

You mean in an opponent trying to beat us kind of way?

3280~~~
Up feckin front Louis, up feckin front. It's not that hard.

3281~~~
No. That an opponent feels they have stopped us by stopping one player.

3282~~~
Balance seems to be code for, wherever I can switch people around to play Rooney. 'Balance' was the excuse for playing Rooney in midfield last season. 'Balance' is the excuse for playing Martial wide left. Its garbage. Increasingly it seems Van Gaal isn't big enough to manage Rooney. 



Opponents can see where the threat is coming from. Why can't our manager?

3283~~~
No different to acknowledging that the best way to stop City is to shut down Silva, or Coutinho at Liverpool. Every side has a player that makes them tick. I always assume Mata would be that player for us but it looks like Martial is perceived as more of a threat right now.

3284~~~
Difference is for example with city that might be the best way but clearly not enough. Aguero or Toure can just as easily do the damage. 

With us they only need to take care of martial and that's all they need to. He is our only threat and IMO  some of the blame for that falls on LVG for his system.

3285~~~
No all

3286~~~
Sorry but cannot agree. He is mainly responsible but not the only one. He is not telling Memphis to dribble into defenders, he is not telling Rooney to take 3 touches to control before passing to the opposition, he is not telling Mata to hit the first defender with his set pieces,  he is not telling Valencia to hit the cross against the defenders legs. So on and so forth.

3287~~~
We need to start playing him as a number nine, he should be the focal point of the team because he's our best player at the moment. Put Rooney out on the left.

3288~~~
Is there any chance at all van Gaal will play him up front in place of Rooney tomorrow or is it just wishful thinking? If he's given the chance to play there it's pretty clear to everyone that he will do a better job. 

We can't afford to slip up again in Europe and need someone to be clinical for us up front, Martial is obviously the answer right now. He is being limited out wide and the bottom line is we can't rely on Rooney right now in the form he is in, surely van Gaal and Giggs have to be aware of that by now and go with Martial as our main striker.

3289~~~
If they haven't been made aware this far into the season, unfortunately I don't see them ever realising.

3290~~~
He is telling most of them not to play their natural game. He is also the one who chose to let players go without suitable replacements. He is also the one who insists on Rooney up top.

3291~~~
What is that you think the likes of Memphis Rooney and Mata want to do but are asked not to?

3292~~~
Mata def wants to play through the middle, I think the world and his dog know that.

Rooney is not a back to goal, hold up the ball striker, especially not this Rooney (TBH the main issue here is his insistence in playing Rooney)

Memphis has just been poor, however its not easy being asked to hug the touchline when double teamed and having to produce magic because the rest fo the team is so rigid (still doesn't excuse his poor performances). Memphis has more license to roam inside last season at PSV.

Martial is doing a very good job out on the left, but even with him, you can see that basically we get the ball out there, he has to stay there and then he has to produce magic. Put the lad upfront, and allow the rest of the team not to be so rigid positionally, especially the left winger.

3293~~~
I'm hoping he's asking Rooney to not be any good at Football, otherwise I'm out of ideas

3294~~~
Mata has the license to drift anywhere he wants as you can see in games. Let's not pretend he's been asked to hug the touchline and stay there. 

Memphis starts out wide to keep our width Hut again, he can go as he pleases, infield or out wide. I don't see his poor performances having anything to do with a lack of freedom and everything to do with him not being  able to do what wingers are supposed to.  

Rooney played the #10 role and was as poor.

3295~~~
Van Gaal isn't blind. Nor is he stupid. Unless he had his eyes closed, he would have watched those games just like we did, seen what Martial is capable of in a centre forward position and taken note. 

So why persevere with Rooney at centre forward? Well the easiest explanation is that Van Gaal has been working on this system for over a year now with the players. Some players have more experience of playing in this system than others, Rooney being one of them (as he was pretty much undisputed first choice striker before Martial arrived). He's had over a year to absorb Van Gaal's ideas, so it's natural that Van Gaal trusts him to implement his ideas on the pitch, whether you agree with them or not. 

Watch Rooney's movement on and off the ball and you can see there is a purpose to what he does within the scheme of our play. Not a lot is coming off for him at the moment but then again, he's not the player he once was. Privately, even he must know that. But in Van Gaal's eyes, Rooney's experience of playing that role in this system means he gets the nod ahead of Martial, whose versatility means he can still affect games from the left wing. Which leads me to conclude that until Martial gains more experience, or we sign another forward, Van Gaal will likely persevere with Rooney at centre forward, because he believes the system works, and the results will improve with time.

And maybe, just maybe, the style of play might improve too.

3296~~~
OK, I get you.

I'm not too concerned by a point away at Palace, nor the fact that they tried to shut Martial down. October was always going to be difficult - the worrying result/performance was 3-0 to the Arse, I honestly thought we could compete better than that.

3297~~~
Funny,in think its the exact opposite. Arsenal was a freak result. The points dropped against teams like Swansea and especially Palace give me the most concern. We don't create enough against the teams lower down the table.

3298~~~
The Swansea result & performance was poor. A draw away to Palace is par for the course.

Getting beaten 3-0 by one of our major rivals, and failing to beat City at home when they were missing their 2 best players is a better barometer of where we are IMO.

3299~~~
Yeah, I'm not worried about Arsenal. We got sliced and diced for 20 minutes and the game was done. And besides Arsenal are competing for the title.
We do have an issue in the first 20-odd minutes of every game, where our players look like they have been drugged. 
As the game progresses, we wake up.
I think our players should take some caffeine pills before starting each match.

Against Crystal Palace and Middlesborough - these teams should've got spanked. But as is now the norm, we can't score a goal.
By the time we were missing penalties (we scored 1 out of 4), I was laughing too hard to care. It's as if our players lose their senses when they are in front of goal.

1 goal scored in the last 4 games.

3300~~~
You missed out the game against Middlesborough. We lost that one on penalties and couldnt score in 120 minutes.

3301~~~
Where have I done so? He spends most of the game in a position where he is largely ineffective. He comes alive usually when he drifts, but fact is he has to go back to his position more often than not. It is not ideal.

Memphis has been poor as I said, but if you look at Martial when he has played LW even when he has played well, he has been more or less always stuck on the left. Crosses come into the box and Rooney isn't even in there, and there is no one on the end of them.

What is that about Rooney @10. Rooney has been poor as I said, he is still in the team, that is down to the manager. On top of that Rooney shouldn't be anywhere near a team who requires the forward to hold the ball up and play with his back to goal.

In terms of our attacking play, the manager is not utilising the players to the best of their strengths, instead he is attempting to put square pegs into round holes to suit his idea of a system

3302~~~
At this point, I'd even shift Herrera out to the left to accommodate Rooney as #10 and ultimately Martial as #9.

3303~~~
Can't seem to get him the ball in good spots. Whenever he gets it, he's surrounded by players.

3304~~~
Created 2 chances from 8 passes. If Rooney could find a through ball to him any time soon he could have scored too. Receiving the ball absolutely everywhere along the top line as well. Absolute menace of a player.

3305~~~
It's insane that we can't capitalize on it. He's surrounded by three guys, manages to move the ball around and instead of quick, swift action, we resort to slowing the game down, allowing them to get in place again. Lingard was the main beneficiary but couldn't do anything of notice.

3306~~~
Good to see him in the strikers position.

3307~~~
Thought it was his worst performance for us till now. Though they were doubling up on him every time.

3308~~~
Yeah he wasn't up to his usual high standards.

3309~~~
His worst outing so far tonight

I didn't want to see him come off but I can understand why

I think he needs a rest. Played loads for us and for France in a short space 

If only we had strikers to rotate him with

3310~~~
The other players seem incapable of using Martial's smart runs. There were situations today when the other attackers kept making the wrong decisions with their final passes instead of passing it to Martial, who was all alone in the box a couple of times. 

It's always tough playing against a team that has parked 3 buses and Martial was always surrounded by 3-4 players, which is insane. Yes, he lost the ball more than usual today, but still made things happen.

3311~~~
I thought it was the correct decision to bring him off.

3312~~~
Poor game from him today and taking him off was the right decisions, he has played a lot in the last couple of weeks so he might have been a little jaded.

3313~~~
Shame we decided to attack (or were rather forced by the fans) only after he come off.

3314~~~
He looked gassed in the second half. He should probably sit the game against West Brom at the weekend. The kid needs a break.

3315~~~
I thought his first half was decent, but what are you gonna do if you're constantly surrounded by three people? We have to learn to capitalize on it more than anything.

3316~~~
He needs a bloody rest, he's a 19 year old lad with the weight of the world's biggest football club on his shoulders. 

Why on earth Van Gaal decided to sell all of our strikers and not replace them is anyone's guess, the bigger mystery is why he won't give James Wilson a bloody shot from the bench.

3317~~~
His poorest outing for us which Michael Owen highlighted at every chance while lubing up Rooney.

3318~~~
Not a great outing, but the lad was surrounded like the popemobile at all times.

3319~~~
Agreed. It's obvious that he's tired.

3320~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3321~~~
One of the problems I have noticed with him (common with young players)  is that he switches off a lot, far too often when a move breaks down he doesn't react quickly enough to getting back into the game and just stands where he was or walks slowly

3322~~~
Probbably a little Over played, Looked tired and i can understand that. LVG has some big balls to take him off at that stage , and especially for Fellaini <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>, its the best decision to make but you just know the whole of OT was gonna have a moan when they saw the Numbers on the board come up

3323~~~
There was once chance at the start of the second half where Lingard beat his man and drilled it in low, was never going to make it to Rooney but the CSKA player made a hash of the clearance. I thought if Martial had gambled on the cross coming in he'd have easily got a shot away and probably scored. Despite all the weird criticism Owen threw at him was surprised he didn't mention that, thought it was obvious Martial was being dozy there.

3324~~~
Another game where he gets tripled up on. The other players should be running into all the space left.

3325~~~
Below par, but his par is very high in fairness. CSKA had clearly, and rightly, marked him out as the main danger so he was often crowded out by defenders. Could possibly do with a bit of a rest, but I'm not sure if we'd cope without him!

3326~~~
Pardew has worked us out...

3327~~~
There was one moment in the first half, it was when he ripped that brute's shirt, he was being chased down by four CSKA players and manhandled into the corner. 

It demonstrates the threat he possesses and how much defenders - and coaches - worry about him. Some uncharacteristic indecision in the second half tonight, which we can forgive.

3328~~~
His hold up play for a 19 year old is just incredible.

3329~~~
Looked poor tonight but actually did have some decent chemistry with rooney in the hole as the setanta commentary pointed out. 

Again we just look better when he is up top

3330~~~
He looked really tired when he came off. He's played a lot of football for a teenager. In an ideal world he'd get a game or two off.

3331~~~
Not his best performance tonight, quite frustrating really as he got given an opportunity up top and was offside constantly and his link up play wasn't as good as it has been.

3332~~~
Frustrating we're making him a work horse and playing him further away from goal, where yes he has room to run into but also means he has to do more to get into it too. With players like Martial, you should give him all the tools to succeed and playing him wide left (now that he's getting double/triple marked) means he's battling twice as hard.

3333~~~
And your thoughts on tonight?

3334~~~
Probably his worst game in a United shirt, but he's always so positive. Just didn't come off tonight, unfortunately. 

Didn't really have any chances today that I can think of, and this goes back to what I, and others, have been saying about we sometimes look void of ideas, regardless of who we play up top. We were better in terms of creating more opportunities tonight, but we still didn't create that much, and because of that, Martial sometimes feels he has to do everything on his own.

3335~~~
His weakest performance so far other than maybe against Arsenal. With Rooney also playing as a striker that may well have been the first time in his professional career he's played with a strike partner? Did he play alongside Giroud for France or something?

3336~~~
He was surrounded by three guys each time he got the ball. If we had runners going off him (and were smarter) we would have had people free at times. Hes clearly a threat and you can see the opposition will do that more to him now. We need others to help him out.

His hold up play is the most surprising thing about him, its better than I thought it had any right to be at this stage of his career.

3337~~~
The stats are pretty grim tonight

Passing - 57%
Shots OT - 1 from 1
Dribbles success - 1 from 9

3338~~~
Who cares? Booo

3339~~~
Below par and faitgued. All things considered I'm fine with that. We've run him into the ground and asked him to be a tracking winger, whilst expecting him to beat players up the pitch AND score goals/create chances.

Shouldn't have been in this position in the first place.

3340~~~
It was a difficult game for him with few chances (if any?) to get the ball in the kind of situations on the break that players like him thrive off. He didn't look nearly as sharp as he can be. Wouldn't complain if he got a rest against West Brom but I'm guessing Van Gaal knows what colour zone he is in.

3341~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3342~~~
It is insane that this guy is shouldering the burden of carrying our entire attack.

3343~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://instagram.com/p/9pKSsSKZ_A/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://instagram.com/p/9pKSsSKZ_A/</a>

"Bad match for me tonight." 

Looks like he's taking it a bit rough. He seems to have very high standards which makes me even more confident in him, it's not easy when a team is parking the bus like that. He'll grow even stronger from this.

Most importantly, Hope he didn't think the crowd was booing him...

3344~~~
Didn't he get the memo? The crowd was booing to support him.

3345~~~
He and Berba played together upfront at times for Monaco.

3346~~~
We attacked for 90minutes. Did you really think the fans forced us to attack? Or you trolling?

3347~~~
Played lots of games since arriving and teams are singling him out already, ideally we should be able to rest him as he's going to have bad patches. It's refreshing to see him come out on his instagram and say he had a bad game though. I mean he doesn't need to do that and shouldn't have to but it shows he's pretty humble and mature.

3348~~~
He got standing ovation after the boos and whole stadium was chanting his name. Don't think I've ever heard OT be so loud as they were with the boos, attack attack and his chant. 

Think he's just being critical bout himself, which is a good thing.

3349~~~
Good thing LVG decided to rest him a bit.

3350~~~
Sorry but in no way should he of been subbed off, especially not for Fellaini.

3351~~~
It worked though, especially for our upcoming games it was a good substitution as he was visibly tired.

3352~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3353~~~
Well he's a better judge of his own performance than many on here (and in Old Trafford last night). Was always going to happen, though. He's just a kid who's performed miles better than expectations this season. Great to see he sets himself high standards and isn't going to strop about being subbed. I just hope our other attacking players can compensate for this inevitable dip in form. We badly need Rooney and Lingard to kick on from last night's performance and have a decent run of games. I'm not sure we can rely on Memphis to fill the void, based on last night's cameo.

3354~~~
In his short time here he's become our only real attacking threat eventhough he was virtually unknown player when United first signed him. LVG said he's one for the future, and IMO even Martial himself didn't think he would play that much, let alone starting in almost every match. Being only 19y old and in another country with expectaion that are constantly raising can really damage young player no matter how talented he is. No one wants him to burn out, let him develop and being rested now and then will only benefit both him and United in long run. Fellaini gave us other options when introduced and in the end United won the match so don't really see why it's so big deal that Martial was taken off earlier than expected.

3355~~~
He needs a good winter break to recharge his batteries. Maybe something resembling Fergie's treatment of Ronaldo<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jan/03/newsstory.sport6" target="_blank"> when he was Martial's age</a>. Young players will have ups and down, both mentally and physically - you can see some signs of exhaustion already, and Martial didn't even start that many games for Monaco. So there's an excessive workload on top of playing in a faster, more intense league. Unfortunately, we are super-light up front and he's been our best attacker this season, so the club can't really afford to give him a few weeks off. Just hope he's not run into the ground, especially when he won't get a lot of rest in the summer with the European Championship in France.

3356~~~
Really hope we tell Domenech to go easy on his minutes during the international break.

Edit: Feck, meant Deschamps.

3357~~~
feck sake. I just looked at my calendar and realised it's two weeks between WBA and Watford. Then it dawned on me.. sodding internationals!

3358~~~
Where are people getting this he looks tired malarky from?

He doesn't stop running, and he's 19 years old. He's probably on a massive high if anything.

3359~~~
That would be from him looking, you know, tired?

He even admitted himself he had a bad game, on his instagram page. Why are you insisting the opposite is true?

3360~~~
His worst performance for us. Still an incredible player though and will surely be the best striker in this league before too long.

3361~~~
To be fair, he was poor, but being tired is different. Maybe mentally tired if anything, and could ideally do with a break as you said. Unfortunately, our attack is so poor that we couldn't even get away with giving him a proper rest in the League Cup to a Championship side.

3362~~~
He was poor and got worse as the game went on. Wouldn't you say it's fair to call that a tired looking performance?

3363~~~
They put 2 men on him all the time and crowded him out. If we were 1-0 already then I think it would have been accepted easier but people were nervy. I think LVG handled it well enough. Good to see the player being honest and i'm glad he didn't thank the supporters for their 'support' as he seems to back the managers decision.

3364~~~
I think it's fair to call it a poor one, that got worse, as you said. I think to call it tired, you'd need to see signs of tiredness, not poor form. I saw him running around up until he went off, sprinting for loose balls (and winning these sprints). Nothing was working.

He may well have been tired, and you may well have detected tiredness, I'm just saying I didn't observe it specifically.

3365~~~
I think tiredness can be mental as well as physical. He seemed to lose his focus. Getting caught offside, taking the wrong option, not being aware of what was around him. Tired in mind as much as body.

Anyhoo, we're arguing about semantics here. When someone is having a bad game and gets worse as the game goes on, then it's a no brainer to sub him off.

3366~~~
Indeed, we are fundamentally in agreement, as I believe he was mentally tired, and should have come off.

3367~~~
A downturn was inevitable, he's just 19 and it's been amazing what he has already done for us. He was poor last night for sure. I'm sure he'll bounce back quickly though.

3368~~~
19 yo and his hold up play is better than most other forwards in the PL.

3369~~~
Maybe it's just me but when I watch Martial, it seems like he doesn't waste any motion. No matter if he's having a good game or a bad one. Which at his age is remarkable. 
His composure is ridiculous for a 19 year old

3370~~~
so this lol

3371~~~
I wasn't serious. Are people really still using the world <i>trolling?</i>

3372~~~
Don't know if this has already been mentioned but it seems, from his instagram posts, that he thinks that the crowd were booing <i>him</i> when he was subbed due to his performance

3373~~~
"<b><span style="font-size: 22px">Bad match for me tonight but good win  <a class="externalLink" href="https://instagram.com/explore/tags/workhard/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#Workhard</a>"</span></b>

Did he say anything else? If not, then I wouldn't say he thought he was being booed. Probably just thought he didn't play well enough. His personal standards are probably high.

3374~~~
So he thought he didn't play well, then heard a chorus of boos while he walked off the pitch. Follower immediately by applause for Fellaini. You can see why he might misinterpet the jeers.

3375~~~
I was worried he would at the time, but we started chanting his name a minute after Fellaini came on.

3376~~~
I fecking love this kid. Has the attitude of a true footballer with the kind of potential that could see him turning into a legend. Feet well and truly on the ground for the lad.

By the way, might I add that subbing Martial was a great decision by LVG. A brave one. The boy should not be the be all and end all of our attack. If it gets into his head that the club needs him more than he wants to play for the club then that's how you spoil them. Subbing him off also preserved the lad. He's been playing non-stop ever since he's come in and that amount of football could easily burn up talent. He needs to stay fresh for the weekend and I'm sure that was a part of thinking.

The way the lad ran off the pitch without a moment's hesitation was such a refreshing sight. No complaints. No fuss. Straight off. Well done lad. You are my favourite player at United right now. Well... maybe after De Gea, Smalling and Mata.

3377~~~
It's why I don't agree with people jeering their own team regardless of circumstance. Very easy to be misinterpreted.

3378~~~
I was thinking this at the time. I really hope someone tries to get it across to him that he wasn't being booed because I won't be surprised if he thinks he was booed off.
I've always disagreed with booing anyway. I just don't see how it helps.

3379~~~
The Thing is that even in one of his weaker games you can always see glimpses of his Quality. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about Depay.

3380~~~
Followed immediately by the crowd singing his name.

3381~~~
How could he be certain that the people singing his name were the same people that were booing him a few seconds before?

3382~~~
I'm sure he understood that the boos were just disagreement with the substitution. After all, the fans chanted his name afterwards. I don't think he's that thick.

3383~~~
He isn't thick.

3384~~~
It's odd the papers have stopped quoting his price tag incessantly, wonder why that is? <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

3385~~~
That's the first time he's been subbed early, and given how we were chasing a goal - he probably thought that spoke volumes that he didn't play well enough. 

I seriously doubt he thought the fans were booing him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He's not stupid I'm sure. He's been here for 2 months or so now, not booed anyone during that time so I'm sure he realised it was the fans booing the surprising decision. 

It doesn't matter at the end of the day I guess.

3386~~~
You know him, do you?

3387~~~
Typical from you. At what point has he appeared thick? Going by his interviews he's not exactly a stupid boy.

Schneiderlin has singled out intelligence as one of his assets.

3388~~~
Whatever it is. He has it.

Just. Makes. Things. Happen.

3389~~~
He has to adapt to being the center of attention, but still created himself a great chance. Nonetheless, quite easily my favorite United player on the current team and probably in a while.

3390~~~
Too much pressure on him to create really. Mata and Rooney should be the ones carrying this burden (not saying they have been poor, just not creative enough).

3391~~~
I disagree, I thought he was plenty creative, but look at how many players he's surrounded by. He can't force it or else will look stupid.

3392~~~
He being who? Mata or Rooney?

3393~~~
My bad, thought you were talking about Martial, clearly should learn to read even short posts properly and not just fly over them. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

EDIT: Nonetheless, I think it's difficult for us to be very creative with the way West Brom is playing. Typical Tony Pulis tactics against a big club. I saw a couple of dangerous passes by Mata.

3394~~~
Best player of the first half. Created our two best chances, one for Lingard and one for himself. We need more players of his caliber.

3395~~~
That Lingard one was basically handed to him though, he didn't have to do too much. Shame Lingard's first touch was poor, otherwise that could've been our best chance of the game.

3396~~~
His footwork is a joy to watch.

It wasn't a hard chance to create but his quickness of thought, awareness and weight of pass were all good, which is not always the case with young players.

3397~~~
Funnily enough I think we'd be more dangerous with him on the left right now, as he's the only one who can take players on and go past them consistently.

3398~~~
Hit and miss but still our most dangerous player. Good stuff for the chance but probably should have scored.

3399~~~
The pass was underhit in my opinion, part of the reason why Lingard couldn't get a shot in quicker.

3400~~~
It was a poor first touch by Lingard, he simply hit the ball a little too hard.


Martial looks tired again in the second half. He really needs a break.

3401~~~
His smirk was just brilliant.

3402~~~
After the penalty?

I liked it too, such a calm character.

3403~~~
Didn't look tired at all at the end there.

3404~~~
True, but that could just be a matter of channelling your last reserves. He knew it was a huge chance to put the game away. That's what great players do.

3405~~~
Had a decent game upfront today. Needs space to really come alive though. Does he get the assist for the penalty?

3406~~~
Would have scored if he wasn't brought down, I'm sure. Exciting player to watch, even when he's not scoring. Always looks likely to be able to create a yard of space when the ball is pinged to him with his back to goal. Got a shot away from it in the first half.

3407~~~
He looked like a kid in school, smirking while his mate is getting bollocked by the teacher. I burst out laughing.

3408~~~
Third name on the squad sheet for me behind De Gea and Smalling.

3409~~~
His (lack of) expressions are just hilarious.

3410~~~
Already a big fan of this lad, has all the talent to build the future of our attack around.

3411~~~
In fantasy football he does.

3412~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CTOW-IiWEAA8BEz.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CTOW-IiWEAA8BEz.jpg:large"/>

3413~~~
Safe to say we are on our way to rebuilding our spine.  DeGea - Smalling - Schneiderlin ( still needs to establish himself)- Martial.

3414~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3415~~~
Well he should because he was pretty damn important in winning it

3416~~~
Ridicilous talent. Sometimes hit and miss sure, but he makes things happen. He's got that X-factor.

3417~~~
I thought his all round game was below its usually high standards.

But I loved that last little touch of his before he got sent down for the penalty. He knew were the defender was and played him into the foul perfectly. Very mature forward play.

3418~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3419~~~
Should have scored off that chance in the first half though. After that great bit of skill, he hit it bang straight at the keeper.

3420~~~
The guy is 19 he's not tired for fs. His form is allowed to dip without people making up that he's tired. Overall it was a solid performance and could easily have got a goal or assist

3421~~~
His acceleration just after pass from Ander is another reason why he should play as striker. Another thing is staying cool and waiting for defender to make a move and in the end his last mistake in the match.

Signs of a deadly striker aren't stopping from occurring.

3422~~~
He got an assist

3423~~~
Does the penalty count?

3424~~~
It does.  He's the one that gets the penalty.  Technically he earns it. 

You can argue it's not from open play,  but the book says it's one.

3425~~~
Great stuff <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3426~~~
He doesn't smile much but his performance really put a smile on my face.

3427~~~
So cool he should be the next James Bond. Even in an off day for his high standards he still put in a performance like that. What a talent we have in our hands.

3428~~~
Looks like he played a free role up front today, I lost count how many times he switched sides in the first half. Played more forward than Rooney too today which is a positive.

3429~~~
I was disappointed when he was brought down. Really hoped he'd score.

3430~~~
90 minutes into football and chill and he gives this look

3431~~~
Ha!

3432~~~
Hopefully Depay starts to settle and hits his Dutch form and gives us an exciting new era up top.

3433~~~
Bring Januzaj back and we could have the youth forward lineup of dreams.

3434~~~
The look on his face is priceless most of the time. It's looks almost apologetic, like he feels bad for the defenders he's burning.

3435~~~
It really is the importance of having pace upfront. I hate Rooney bashing all the time but if that was him in Martials position he wouldn't have made it to the box without being tackled first. 

The fact we can sit deep and leave him 1 up against 2 defenders is so important, as he can just pull into the channel and no defender will beat him to the ball.

3436~~~
Martial has had a great start but I'm not 100% sure he's ready to be our no.1 "90mins every game" main striker and there's a danger we'll burn him out by doing so.  The mistake was not bringing in another more experienced striker in the summer, so that we could at least rest him occasionally or take him out of the firing line if he goes out of form

3437~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/sx3q" width="560"></iframe>

Assist vs Germany.

3438~~~
Fecking brilliant.

3439~~~
More than an assist <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3440~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3441~~~
That hug from Giroud <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>. Great play.

3442~~~
Stupidly good for his age. 

But let's keep accommodating Rooney for him sure.

3443~~~
Who did he get drop with the shoulder feint just before the pass?

3444~~~
The acceleration and close control combo! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3445~~~
I'm already bored of the Bayern, Barca, Madrid rumours and they haven't even started.

3446~~~
Fecking hell how good is he ?

3447~~~
I reckon he's best used on the left right now, more opportunities for him to find some space.

3448~~~
I can't believe he's this good. He can't be.

3449~~~
Fecking hell. Feck me he is out of this world.

3450~~~
How did he get from the point where he got the ball to the position when he made an assist ffs. That is how you turn not even slightly dangerous situation into goal scoring opportunity.

3451~~~

3452~~~
Fantastic.

3453~~~
We have bought the next Messi.

3454~~~
Looked like he did the elastico, and on Ginter. You can see it's him, #18, just after he outmuscles Rudiger.

3455~~~
This could be a steal like it was Ronaldo when he moved to Real, a lot of money but steal in hindsight.

3456~~~
fecking hell

3457~~~
What's he doing playing out on the left though?

3458~~~
Giroud striker. France have a lot of attacking options and for the bulk of his career he's played wide left and works very well there cutting in as above.

3459~~~
Aye, it was a comment made in jest. Just a little ruse.

3460~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> This lad can win us the league.

3461~~~
That goal reminds me so much of Suarez.

3462~~~
Love the way Giroud stopped celebrating his goal just to thank Martial for this masterpiece.

3463~~~
He's just unreal at times.

3464~~~
Martial >

3465~~~
Get him out of Paris sharpish

3466~~~
Feck me, fecking class act

3467~~~
The way the ball just seems to stick with him effortlessly whilst dribbling is so reminiscent of him. The goal against Liverpool was vintage Suarez.

3468~~~
Thats not even fair. Cant believe we bought him . I feel like its too good to be true at times.

3469~~~
What a talent!

Seems to have the perfect temperament too. 

Best teenager in the world?

3470~~~
He's hilariously good <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3471~~~
He just shredded Germany's defense.

3472~~~
He is brilliant and United need to support his growth by making him our main man and building our team that gets the best out of his ability.

3473~~~
I think he easily is and if he was in a more creative/attacking team like Arsenal or City he'd have a lot more goals sadly.

3474~~~
It's a good thing we got him when we did, if he played like this at the euros the fee would of been ridiculous.

3475~~~
Its great we finally got an attacking young world class player, worthy of playing for United, its been too long for a club of our size without having a young world class player in the making

3476~~~
Other than that assist, how was his performance?

3477~~~
Whatever the feck he wants.

3478~~~
Very good again. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/osAJzM7t3t4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

3479~~~
Feel for him and Evra tonight, as well as the rest of the squad obviously. Was Bastien playing for Germany tonight?

3480~~~
Yes, played all 90 minutes. Got skinned by Pogba.

Schneiderlin played the last 10 minutes too.

3481~~~
Yeah I've just checked, hope they're ok, they've had enough problems recently in the French national team. Obviously not on the same level, this is grim.

3482~~~
I have no more words for this guy. Didn't watch the game (I will do) but the assist for Giroud was just pure class, and this is why I continue to say I would play him on the left. People are saying he's not as effective, but to me, from the wing, he's able to use his best attribute - taking players on. I mean, we've been craving for that moment of magic at United from the wing. When he's up top,  he often has his back to goal.

3483~~~
Yeh.Especially since Martial was doing 90% of the work.

3484~~~
Every time I watch I keep dreading the moment where he turns out to not be as good as he's looked to start off. He's just so consistent, as well as being incredibly talented.

3485~~~
He's as good on the left as he is up front I think. Suited more for up front in some games, sometimes out wide. Just for us, he's better through the middle as we have no other striker and you need a striker.

3486~~~
Wow.

That look Boateng gives him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3487~~~
Does he really need the space though? He excels at close control and dribbling through defenders in tight areas, not running the ball down an empty flank a la Bale. He's beating one or two players inside the box with regularity - do that centrally and you'll get into excellent scoring positions.

3488~~~
What a talent. We've done exceptionally well to get him

3489~~~
It would "easier" to dribble from the left with more space to gain momentum and acceleration even if he still excels in tight spaces. There is a big wish to see him in central areas because it would give him more opportunities to score but tbh he isn't a natural goalscorer yet so there is no hurry to play him there.

3490~~~
Good bit of skill but nothing extraordinary as you'd think from the reactions.

3491~~~
Should tell you all we need to know about how devoid & starved we've been of creativity at United for a few seasons now <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3492~~~
Ha, that's exactly what I thought after watching the clip after having read the posts here.

3493~~~
Aye it was magnificent tbf, but yeah, great wingers for other teams probably pull those moves off regularly.

3494~~~
Cmon, It was just a step over. Nicely done ofcourse but nothing incredible about it. The only reason it's even worthy of praise is the small space he pulled it off in.

3495~~~
I think that's the actually "awe" of it - seemingly nowhere to go and yet he executed it perfectly.

3496~~~
Yep, I get that. I doubt anyone would have posted it had it been a simple step over in a lot of space but personally, even the space he pulled it off in doesn't really deserve the over the top praise it got here. Understandable in a way considering the reason you mentioned, the whole media narrative behind him and his age.

3497~~~
Very true. Sad state of our attacking half of our squad though <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3498~~~
To be fair redcafe is known for hyping players. Just read the posts about smalling. You'll think that he's the mixture of moore,  Maldini and Baresi in their prime

3499~~~
I hope the lad isn't too affected by what's happened in Paris. Imagine giving it your all for your country on a football pitch and there are terrorists outside your stadium going berserk. 

So messed up and I hope the lad gets all the support he needs.

3500~~~
<a class="username" data-user="58565, @Varun" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/58565/">@Varun</a> you're not impressed because he makes it look so effortless <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3501~~~
No, Anthony's move on the German defender doesn't make you forget about Maradona and Ronaldinho but it was pretty sweet...more than good enough for our needs.  We've been missing that kind of movement with the ball inside the box for too long.

3502~~~
Unfortunately I'm a Smalling fanboi devilish <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> but yeah, all I'd say is, on this season's form, he's been one of the too CB's in the world, but to be rated as world class, he needs to maintain this for a while longer! 

The Caf is known for its extremes though, so no surprises there. It's football though. Us fans are mostly, too emotional!

3503~~~
He had improved although one need to also take in consideration a lot of things which include

a- A focused and fully committed DDG
b- The signing of Schneiderlin and Bastian in midfield
c- Rojo settling down

Having said that all this talk of world class is pretty BS. Players do not become world class after 6 months of decent football

3504~~~
Yeah, agreed. Though to give them their dues, when the defence is conceding too many they take the blame, and if they're keeping clean sheets - we can't shift the credit they must get credit too.

But a functioning team does help. It's the 1 main issue I've always had with for example, Pique, as much of a fan of his I am. He always played in dominant teams which made him "world class" but many a time I've seen him exposed in 1 on 1's, he seemed in trouble.

But that's another topic for another day. I don't disagree with anything you posted.

3505~~~
Tbf to him, he's the only one in our squad I'd consider capable of pulling it off. Memphis probably the only other one. 
That's harsh. He's just being acknowledged for what he is, among the beat CBs around atm. No one's comparing him to all time greats let alone call him one.

3506~~~
Whether or not you rate the goal as amazing, I think it's quite clear this lad has real talent and potential. The amazing thing for me is that in today's day and age, hardly anyone even knew of him until we signed him - especially on here. It really does show me that we maybe need to have some faith in our club's recruiting strategy instead of ripping it apart for not signing the likes of griezmann.

3507~~~
Bit of a daft post after a video of him doing brilliant work on the left wing, following on from his worst United performance so far when played centrally.

3508~~~
I would definitely play him on the left than Depay. For Rooney, we should just get a better striker.

3509~~~
So people don't even know why LVG plays him on the left?

3510~~~
Saying that he's on form and if he carries on doing that he will be world class is one thing. Saying that he's world class, one of the best defenders in football and creating ridiculous Smalling vs Martial threads is a different cup of tea

I also believe that hyping players is doing them a big disservice. In Italy players are criticized and scrutinized for their entire career and irrespective of their reputation (Cannavaro, Batistuta and even Maldini were criticized). The results are there to be seen. The only player I can think of who was massively hyped and cuddled was.....Mario Balotelli

3511~~~
How many CBs have been better than him over the past year? I think it's fair to say he's among the best around. The whole "world class" thing is nonsense anyways, people define it to suit themselves. 

Regarding the last point, with all due respect to the Italians, who gives a feck how they treat their players?

3512~~~
Good bit of skill? That is Germany mate not Albania. No offense to Albanians but you get the drift. His play was ridiculously good.

3513~~~
TBF that post isn't meant to criticize Smalling. Some of the best defenders in the world played in some of the strongest defenses of the time. Maldini played alongside beasts such as Baresi, Tassotti and Rijkaard. Cannavaro won the WC surrounded by talent such as Gattuso, Pirlo and Buffon at his back. However let keep things into contest. Yes Smalling is playing well, he's been an important player for us in the past few months and if he continues to improve than he will become a great defender on the lines of Rio, Vidic and Stam. Yet there's quite a long road to be made

3514~~~
Name five defenders in world football currently better than Smalling.

3515~~~
Yeah and he got the better of Ginter not Boateng. No offense to Ginter <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

3516~~~
I guess you didn't see Boateng trying to intercept the cross.

3517~~~
It does because they won 4 world cups while the creators of football had won just one more than half a century ago despite their various white Peles, HurriKanes, Mr Chelsea, Captain fantastic, Captain Marvel and the rest of the X Men. Let me give you another interesting stat. Everytime Italy won the WC either the nation or the Serie A was in the middle of a scandal. The fascist regime during the 30s and the match fixing scandals of 1982 and 2006. In 2006 Cannavaro was labelled a finished player who shouldn't even be in the WC squad. He went on winning the WC and the ballon d'or. Pressure makes players better while hype ruins them

Maybe that's also the reason why the best talent of the class of 92 happens to be the player who had passed from most hurdles and was questioned out of the lot

3518~~~
There's no doubt that he's playing extremely well. However 6 months of great football does not make a player WC.

3519~~~
Nice bit of strength to shrug off the big guy in the build up as well.

3520~~~
Go watch how well he took his early United goals. Natural calm finisher if ever I've seen one.

3521~~~
It all depends on your meaning of World Class, at the moment I'd only put 3 possibly 4 players in that field; Messi, Ronaldo, Suarez and possibly Augero.

3522~~~
Bale is and so is a few others imo

3523~~~
As I said, it depends on how you see it. No one is right and no one is wrong.

3524~~~
I've been watching him his entire career basically so a few goals for United isn't enough to label him a true goalscorer yet. He still has a very average shooting ability.

3525~~~
How some people can just start a moaning about everything is beyond me.

3526~~~
I don't think anyone is in awe of his assist, people are just in awe of his talent and potential. I'd add that ive been very impressed with his composure and mentality too. 

Considering how little most of us had seen of him, and the headlines on the day the transfer, all the above have been quite the pleasant surprise.

3527~~~
And he shrugged off Ruediger before that, who was mistaken for Boateng.

3528~~~
Correct

3529~~~
Neymar surely?

3530~~~
It's been a year of great performances, not 6 months

3531~~~
Always the same. Even if Messi played for us and scored a hattrick every week, there would be some finding something to moan about.

3532~~~
this.

3533~~~
Debatable, you could also add half a dozen to the list. For me the term WC is used way out of context these days.

3534~~~
I really don't think it's debatable to have Neymar in that bracket now, he's been the second best player in the world this year.

3535~~~
Each to their own.

3536~~~
Pretty much spot on devilish.

3537~~~
Yea I agree I think he is a certainty. Purely from attacking players perspective he must be there. I wouldn't disagree with anyone who name Lewandowski or Muller either

3538~~~
Hype and pressure are related. Are you suggesting these English players aren't under pressure? The media is more than willing to crucify them when things go bad, same for the fans. With Hype comes expectation and pressure.

3539~~~
So? I'm talking about the skill is which is being labelled incredible etc here. That skill had him getting the better of Ginter and not a seasoned top pro like Boateng. It doesn't matter anyways, he can beat who he's up against and if he's playing left wing, it's the rb he will be up against and he beat him. I just pointed it out because of the post I quoted with the German and not Albanian bit. 
Yep. No doubt.

3540~~~
In my opinion they are not. They are massively hyped and protected until they feck up in a tournament. That's not the way to rear talent

3541~~~
Fair enough if you think so. I don't think that's the case.

3542~~~
I genuinely believe Martial is best playing on the left of a 4-3-3 after watching his performances this season.

Only issue is we need a much better no. 9 for him to feed. Otherwise he's our best option up front until then.

3543~~~
Actually I believe they are making youth players a great disservice to be honest. A typical English young player start doing well and the media is all over the place, calling him names, hyping him beyond measure and minimising his weaknesses at each passing day. The player in question is made to believe that he had actually made it, he's a superstar and he doesn't really need to listen to criticism or improve his game at all. Then a major tournament occur, as usual England underachieves and if the player in question happens to have committed a mistake than he's thrown under the bus. All misplaced hopes are thrown over one player as he takes most or in Beckham's case all the crap. 

Critics in Italy are much tougher. They are more difficult to impress and more fickle in terms of questioning the player's talent. Don't heed to my words but the words of the likes of Zola and Vialli who played in both leagues and have found the EPL much less stressful than the Serie A. However if they feck up badly in a major tournament than they never blame a single player because of it. Its a team game and all the team (or at least the manager) will get the blame.

3544~~~
I do agree with what you are saying about the English players. My only point was that they are under pressure to deliver for their clubs due to the hype and expectations. They don't get a free ride. The scapegoating bit, I agree with too but then again, with the English team, they all suck at major tournaments and thus ko one gets singled out unless it's an obvious incident like it was for becks. 

Can't comment on the Italian way of doing things as I don't really follow them.

3545~~~
He shows the sort of qualities I really like in an attacking player, terrific assist.  Plenty to be optimistic with him, no need to rush to judgment on his overall potential as there is a long road ahead for him

3546~~~
I may be wide of the mark here, but he reminds me of Berbatov -- more pace, can beat defenders in a way Berba couldn't, but similarities in terms of hold up play, technique, and ball control.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Z7VaZGEkVs?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Similar to Martial's assist last night. Also has that same sort of swagger, albeit, combined with a greater work ethic.

3547~~~
A pacey and look-like-he-care Berbatov.

3548~~~
If Messi, Ronaldo, Suarez and Aguero are what we are classifying as World Class, then Neymar still has some way to go to get there. Those 4 are definitely one notch above. I'm guessing that Pogba will reach that class sooner than Neymar.

3549~~~
I just said that to a friend about Martial reminding me of Berba.

3550~~~
Aguero above Neymar ? How does one come to that conclusion, Aguero has been fairly underwhelming for Argentina and in the CL whereas Neymar has excelled at any level he's ever played.

3551~~~
Seriously?

3552~~~
What <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3553~~~
His facial expressions are hilarious.

3554~~~
Oh come on now. Neymar has easily been the second best player in the world this year after Messi and has been performing better than Suarez at Barca since the latter joined them(Neymar is Barca 2nd best player even after suarez joined them). 

How on earth do you class Aguero and Suarez above Neymar currently? Messi is the only player in the world right now(this season) who's shown to be better than Neymar who is currently la liga top scorer. 

Neymar has shown proficiency with goals and has better build up play then Ronaldo(who is only a goal machine but doesn't show the all round play Neymar is showing for Barca). 

For some odds reasons Neymar tends to be underrated on the Caf. I mean the majority were going on about how Bale is better than Neymar <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  That's how badly underrated that skinny brazilian is on the Caf.

3555~~~
Martial reminds me more of Luis Suárez (shenanigans aside and strictly in terms of playing style), rather than Berbatov to be honest. Similar raw dribbling style, has the ability to drive at the opposition, weirdly low center of gravity for being almost 6' tall, really good at evading defenders while making the ball stick to his feet. Suárez would play centrally and out wide too, and became a significantly better goal producer once he gained some experience at Ajax. Hope Martial can hit the 20+ goal mark next year or so, and progress from there. Has the chance to be a very complete 9½ forward in the Suárez mold; and also, while he might not be a 110% effort based street fighter like Suárez, it's heartening to see Martial work hard for the team. Not just in attack, but tracking back, and opening spaces for his team-mates. Really intelligent for his age, just seems kinda natural.

PS: That comment regarding Neymar is weird TBF. 10 goals in the Champions League (tied with Messi and Ronaldo but in fewer minutes), 22 goals and 7 assists in La Liga, 7 goals in the Copa del Rey for last season; 12 goals for Brazil in 2014 including 4 at the World Cup where he was the heartbeat of their attacking unit for a total of 50 goals for Brazil and Barcelona in 60 matches. And he's been better than ever in Messi's absence too. If the bar is set at Agüero, Neymar should definitely be there. As should Thomas Müller for that matter. The last bit about Pogba makes you feel he was taking the piss though...

3556~~~
For me, it's Messi, Neymar, Suarez, Ronaldo, Lewandowski -- in that order, though on current form, Lewa might be above Ronaldo.

3557~~~
I can definitely see the Suarez comparison. Do you think the Henry comparisons are wide of the mark? Seems pretty similar to the early Henry who'd play wide-left.

3558~~~
It's weird because my opinion of Martial fluctuates every month. When he first joined United, I thought he looked more like the Atletico or Liverpool version of Fernando Torres with all the pace, eye for goal and composure. Then once he started playing more regularly, some of the Henry similarities came to light in terms of how effectively he dribbled from slightly wider areas, beating his man, good close control. Now, he's evidencing great work-rate and desire to go with all the attacking threat like Suárez. Dunno what player comparison comes up next month. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Truth be told, I'd be really realy happy with the peak version of any one of those 3 players. Torres might look a bit out of place in that company now, but his first season in the Premier League was majestic.

3559~~~
Soon we're gonna compare other players to him.

3560~~~
...

3561~~~
Anyone else worried that we might burn him out later in his career playing him this much at such a young age? I mean not everyone is a physical freak like Ronaldo. Even Rooney at age 30 seems like he's gone.

3562~~~
If Aguero is WC, so does Neymar.

Neymar:
South American Footballer of the Year: 2011, 2012
FIFA Confederations Cup Dream Team 2013
FIFA World Cup Dream Team 2014
UEFA Champions League Team of the Season 2014–15

136 goals in 225 games for Santos, and 67 goals in 107 games for Barca (wiki.)
.. and so far this season has scored 17 goals in 16 games (whoscored.).

Unless of course if you don't rate South American football.

3563~~~
Neymar is the best forward in the world right now and is more talented than Pogba anyway.

3564~~~
Not sure he has that, excuse the phrase, cuntishness that Suarez has -- I think that's half of what drives Suarez on the pitch, a bit like Costa, but obviously a few levels above. Martial just seems so laconic and laid back, but lethal when it counts. That's why I get the Henry thing.. also, the Torres comparison you mention -- the Torres who was a beast and made Vidic look a fool, that is. Not sure Martial has that long-range shooting ability Torres had though, but it remains to be seen -- guy is 19! after-all. 

Can't help but compare him to other players, but none seems to really fit. What I do know, barring injury, please God, is that he is most definitely a potential future Balon d'Or winner. Has everything you'd expect of a world class player, and to have it at such a young age is remarkable. I'd honestly never heard of him before we signed him (well, had seen him play against Arsenal, but couldn't remember his name), and now he's just exploded onto the seen -- keeping Coman, hugely talented in his own right, out of the national side; and who could argue, when you see what he did last night?

3565~~~
I totally agree with you that we are better of playing him out wide. The way we play means our striker usually receives the ball with his back towards the goal this is not the best way to utilise someone like Martial in my mind. When playing out wide he will have much better opportunities to run at the defenders and take players on, I would even perfer him to play as the #10 over striker for the same reason.

3566~~~
He keeps surprising me, his balance and pace control in that dribble is perfect. Fair fecks to our scouting and especially Louis, sometimes his arrogance and
stubbornness can work against him but going all out for this kid and flipping the finger to all is probably going his best piece of business during his time here.

3567~~~
That Neymar post was odd haha

Can't believe we've got him. He's going to be a world class player. Every time I watch Martial, I expect something great.

3568~~~
One of the most laughable posts I've seen in a while. Suarez hasnt been better than Neymar for 1.5 year now, same level. And Pogba? Oh dear, do you even watch him?

3569~~~
What?!? Neymar is already better than Suarez and Aguero in my book. As for Pogba reaching that level before him, I don't know what to say really..

3570~~~
Was he involved in the friendly against Germany?

3571~~~
Yeah, had a nice assist you might be able to find in this thread.

3572~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://instagram.com/p/-Ef27gIcU4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://instagram.com/p/-Ef27gIcU4/</a>

3573~~~
The guy must eat, sleep and breathe football settling down so quickly at that age. Comforting to hope so.

3574~~~
That assist against Germany was unreal. So glad we signed him.

3575~~~
Is to too early to name and shame the kneejerkers on here who derided his transfer?

3576~~~
Hardly daft even if you think that. Simply pointing out he's our most effective forward and with our team struggling for goals, we could do worse than play him up top at least until we replace Rooney.

Van Gaal isn't playing him on the left purely because of him doing a good job out there. He's doing it so Rooney can continue playing.

3577~~~
Regardless of the reason why, he's played better for United out wide than he has up top. Rooney's been a little better in his last 2 or 3 games so Martial left and Rooney central is the best use of our resources. The only time it made sense to play Martial up top was when Rooney should have been on the bench.

3578~~~
Nope, he's only going to get better and better

3579~~~
Not me. I think players that burn out early tend to be those that play with a burst of energy, and I don't see that in Martial. Maybe it's his cool attitude covering up for it, but I just don't see the intensity that might be lost later in his career whenever he's on the ball.

3580~~~
Would be interesting to see a poll about where people prefer to see Martial - out wide or up front.

Up top for me, without a doubt. Apart from the explosive second half against Everton where he destroyed Coleman and some nice moments against City and Palace, he's been much more effective for us as a striker. Even his goal against CSKA Moscow happened when he briefly moved to a central position to make Valencia's cross count. He has great technique, but more often than not he's too far away from goal and is often isolated. He's shown too much composure, great link up and hold up play not to use him a striker.

When played as a striker, he's constantly drifting out wide on the left anyway, so no point restricting him to a wide position. We just need a better number 10 behind him and better delivery from the wings. Despite getting some assists under his belt, his final ball and overall passing need some work, so I think we should keep him in the striker's position.

The way he won the penalty againsy WBA and his tendency to create goalscoring chances out of nothing (Arsenal, WBA games immediately come to mind) are other reasons why he should stay up front.

Buy Mane in January and we're looking good. Obviously we'll also need to sign a better #10 as well, but I guess as long as LvG is at the helm, Rooney won't lose his starting place.

3581~~~

3582~~~
You must be fecking joking....<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/><img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

3584~~~
I just saw this, it better be a fecking joke or a mistake

3585~~~
oh piss off

3586~~~
Holy feck. Hope it's not serious.

3587~~~
Seriously feck off. Sick of international football.

3588~~~
Feck

3589~~~
Literally don't know how to react to this. I want to slump to the floor and karate kick the wall at the same time.

3590~~~
Definitely true. This international break was a fecking disaster.

3591~~~
Looked fine when he went off?

3592~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/iuZ0T2rwguY/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

feck.

3593~~~
Shite.

3594~~~
He picked up a knock earlier on and was limping. But he seemed to run it off.

3595~~~
Video

3596~~~
If its a bandage and not a plaster it might just be a cut or bruise, lets hope

3597~~~
Delle Alli can go eat a bag of dicks. He was roughhousing the French players all night. Its a friendly, not the World Cup final, dimwit. (Although I understand you're keen to impress).

fecking international break.

3598~~~
FFS hopefully just a bruise or something

3599~~~
Please no, just please no

3600~~~
Or a twisted ankle? How long does that take to heal?

3601~~~
Deschamps says knock on top of foot apparently

3602~~~
Sounds like it's an impact injury. Pretty sure he will be fine for Saturday if that's the case

3603~~~
Twisted ankles can be right feckers so it better not be that.

3604~~~
Good job England you useless fecking morons.

3605~~~
Looking on the bright side he could do with a short break from playing really.

Not a good thing playing a 19 year old in every game imo.

3606~~~
Gaaaaaaah! <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

3607~~~
Ah feck off. Just feck off.

3608~~~
feck OFF

3609~~~
The fear among the fans at the thought of Martial getting injured. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> One has got to laugh. How the feck did we leave ourselves in such a fecked up situation with our attackers.

3610~~~
I mean really, we brought this upon ourselves. We were genuinely about to go into the new season with Rooney, Wilson and Fellaini as our main strikers <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3611~~~
It's bloody ridiculous. The state of our attack without him isn't worth thinking about.

3612~~~
International breaks are just so shite. Especially when it is just friendlies.

3613~~~
Please for the love of everything, let it be a simple bruise. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3614~~~
Some of you lots overreact a lot and it gets annoying. You just read what Deschamps said yet you wouldn't stop with all these worst case scenarios such as twisted ankle etc. 

Bloody hell people get a grip. From the look of things and what Deschamps said it's nothing serious, so let's keep the hysteria and pessimism when we actually get something conclusive which point out to such otherwise the lots of you just want to sound tragic despite signs showing there is nothing serious. 

God people can get irritating in this place.

3615~~~
The reality is that we shouldn't be relying on just 1 striker

3616~~~
Too true. Even if Martial is injured, it's not the end of the world.

3617~~~
While this might be true, it's not the point I was making.

3618~~~
We already have issues in the final third, if our main attacking threat is injured than it doesn't bode well.

That being said it doesn't seem serious, hysteria is justified though.

3619~~~
I'd prefer to use the word "concern" but hysteria is just mad. Before any confirmation you see a lot of people shitting their pants.

3620~~~
Am I the only one thinking it might actually be beneficial for the lad to be rested a few games before the busy Christmas period? If it's not a serious injury and just a knock it'd be a forced layoff for sure, but it might be better in the long run.

Our main problem is we're obviously so reliant on his attacking spark to create chances, so I can understand the 'concern'.

3621~~~
Without him and attack that is already horrendous to watch and which struggles to create chances will become even worst. He's that important to us now.

3622~~~
It's not the "end of the world" for anyone, but it's natural for people to get more annoyed when our most exciting player gets injured. I've defended LVG/the style criticisms a lot, but without Martial there's not much excitement in attack on show is there? And loads of people look forward to our matches being fans.

3623~~~
You wouldn't think so by reading some comments ("we're fecked" etc etc ..)

3624~~~
It is considering we have no forward line without him

3625~~~
Why do useless friendlies always injure so many players, and we have one of the worst attacks in the league, the only think that gave us on the attcking side to look forward to was the unpredictabilty and quality of Martial, I hope the match on weekend wont be another snorefest to watch, with zero players being able to take their man on

Maybe Depay will be forced to start now, should be interesting how he does

3626~~~
It's a farce that an injury to one forward should cause so many problems anyway.

3627~~~
We do even if it's a very frustrating (shitty) one. Injuries are annoying and even more so when the players is important but they happen and I just accept it.

3628~~~
I understand the frustration (if he's injured). The rest (Rooney, Depay etc) haven't exactly filled people with confidence. But yeah, let's see what happens if he isn't available. From a personal POV, I have to say he's become one of the biggest reasons to look forward to watching us play so there's that side of it too.

Let's see what happens if he's out for Saturday first, and then see how we perform. For all we know we put out a good performance and win.

3629~~~
If we put in a good performance, Mata, Rooney, Herrera all can score. But we need to put in a good performance.

3630~~~
Don't forget Memphis, Young and Lingard....

3631~~~
If we had, we wouldn't be panicking so much. During the treble season none of us worried if either Ole, Cole, Teddy or Yorke were injured because we were sure others would compensate to them. We dont have that now

3632~~~
Panicking when you know for a fact that he'll miss the game is one thing and panicking when you know have no confirmation is extremely stupid for me.

3633~~~
Still, he's the only decent striker we have. The rest are either too unproven or too shit. No one knows if hes only missing 1 game either

3634~~~
Then why start panicking now ?

3635~~~
Cause it can be worse.

Im not panicking, Im just gutted that's all and I am sorry for LVG. He inherited too many crappy players and if shit hits fan the blame will fall on him

3636~~~
My comment wasn't specifically aimed at you but at many posters in this thread and the one for the friendly match. LVG has to take some responsibility for not adding another attacking player (playing Fellaini as a striker is madness for instance).

3637~~~
LVG got rid of RVP and Falcao which proven to be masterstrokes since they are both finished. He did allow Chicarito to leave which may be considered to be a mistake however the little pea wanted to leave and he brought Martial whose a great player. There's a limit to how many players a manager can be allowed to sign so you cant blame him for not spending another 35-50m on a striker, especially since we've got that fat feck on top salary and a long term contract.

3638~~~
I don't blame him for not buying an expensive player but more about loaning a (fairly inconsistent) player like Januzay. However if he had to buy a player, I'm sure one not too expensive could have been found.

3639~~~
Is there any news on his scan yet?

3640~~~
Loaning Januzaj was a bit stupid. However I disagree on the second point for two reasons

a- football has changed. Defenses are getting tougher season after season. I was lucky to watch in summer a United game during the 90s and I was amazed how the EPL had improved on that level. Some of the spaces and mistakes done by the EPL defenders of the time would be considered hilarious in today's football. I wonder how many of those CBs would even make it to a top 5 EPL club these days. Also the systems had changed. The time of having two strikers upfront is over so you really need a top quality striker upfront. A Teddy or a Forlan type of striker will probably not do.  

b- We need to understand that players are highly paid employees. We're talking here of people earning 70-300k a week here and not some clerk on minimum wage. That's why we simply didn't add more midfielders when we had a nearly 40 year old Giggs, Scholes, Cleverley, Fletcher and the rest of SAF's favourites there and that's why we couldn't add another striker in especially since we already have a 300k a week striker playing there. 

I believe that Rooney is a bigger problem for the club than we simply think. He's on top salary, on a long term contract and he doesn't seem to want to go to Turkey or the MLS anytime soon. If the white Pele decides to remain to OT till the end of his contract than we'll probably not be able to add that quality striker we need as an alternative to Martial

3641~~~
How can you feel sorry for him if it's all come down to lack of personal(players). This excuse about 8 coach inheriting shit players doesn't apply to LVG right now given he's been at the club for 2 years and has had time to rid himself of what he considered dead woods or useless to his plans. 

And he's had money to spend on a squad of his liking. If there happen to be a lack of further attacking options that would be on him, not anyone else. He got rid of other strikers he felts weren't going to cut it for him, was given the money to buy replacement but opted to go on with only Rooney(now if this is whether he didn't want to buy another striker beside martial or he couldn't pull it off despite trying, it's still on him). 

I wish people would stop with this " Manager inherited crappy players therefore we feel sorry for him". This doesn't apply to Van Gaal anymore as I've explain in the above paragraphs.

3642~~~
There's plenty of dead wood to clear and some will be more difficult to dislodge than others

3643~~~
I still don't see how that would excuse the manager if you were to lack attacking options when he was given the funds and had time to act. 

This whole inheriting shit players narrative doesn't apply with Van Gaal right now. That would have made sense when he just got here and had to deal with the cards dealt to him, but right now it's not the case, he's bought his own players and had plenty of time doing so. The excuse about inheriting a terrible squad as to feel sorry for him is utter nonsense.

3644~~~
There's a limit to the amount of players a manager can bring in two summer transfer windows. Also players on high salary must first be sold to make way to other players and that is not as easy as you think especially if they happen to be on a long term contract

3645~~~
You can also chose not to let players go unless you have suitable replacments.

3646~~~
Everything you sais is true but it still doesn't need explain as to why LVG would make this stupid decision of going into the season with our current attacking options. Moyeq fecked us with the Rooney contract but it's thanks to that he is still so big and important at the club.

3647~~~
We could well do but we should never be in a position where one injury should be any huge cause for concern.

3648~~~
Yet we've always been and so are plenty of teams. 

Earlier it was Carrick being our only central midfielder under Sir Alex. 

City last season had nothing in defence after their main two. Two of their three main defenders were Mangala and Demichelis. 

Arsenal are always an injuring away from being completely fecked. Sometimes it's "we don't have a decent keeper", and other times it's "what if cock gets hurt". 

The issue is more to do with the attackers we put faith in and how "well" they've done. Hopefully next summer we finally sort that out.

3649~~~
And when things like that happen it's braise of a mistake in not having sufficient cover. There's no excuse for going into the season with two strikers especially when has played as often out wide as up front. Arsenal isn't a great example for why this isn't a big deal.

3650~~~
There's a lot that isn't ideal. Things tend to be less than ideal when you're on the road to the top. Unsurprisingly it's only the teams that have reached the pinnacle i.e Bayern, Barcelona, Madrid, and in terms of squad strength it seems, City that can usually say we don't have such issues in our squad.

I have to say I take this transition phase for what it is, which is how I saw 2003-06, where I do think we went wrong more than having two strikers up front, which I think isn't that bad a situation, is putting all our faith into an attack of Rooney, Depay, Young and Mata. But anyway, that's what we have for now.

3651~~~
As said letting Januzaj go on loan was stupid. Selling Chicarito was stupid too unless he wanted to leave or/and it was the only way for us to bring Martial in. What concerns me is that we probably wont be bringing in a quality striker unless Rooney leaves. That's a bit of a problem since no one would want Rooney at this point

3652~~~
It's only a huge cause for concern because Rooney started the season so poorly. Which won't have been something taken into account when looking at resources for the season ahead. Even with Martial out, we have Lingard, Pereira, Mata, Young and Wilson all capable of playing the position he would most likely be used in. The fact that a couple of these players are relatively unproven youngsters is something a lot of us were happy enough with at the end of the transfer window, as it was evidence of Van Gaal's commitment to youth. Personally, I'd have to say I'm in favour Van Gaal's paradigm of having a lean squad and, hence, lots of opportunities for kids.

3653~~~
True.

I hope he returns in January. I'm a fan of the kid's abilities, and I thought he showed us some good stuff early on before he went on loan.

3654~~~

Erm...

3655~~~
Good news.

3656~~~
It would still be an issue even if Rooney was in great form. Who do we look to from the bench if the game isn't going well? Fellaini as it has been all season with limited success. Given Wilson and Pereira's limited game time it becomes quite pointless really. Even when we need a goal he never has Wilson on the bench to throw on.

3657~~~
feck me I've only just realised he has a wife and kid. Are we sure he's definitely 19?

3658~~~
He also just had another child I think.

3659~~~
He has a foot injury apparently. Valencia had a foot injury (not sure if it's the exact same injury) and he is out for apparently 5 months. Let's hope Martial's is no were near as severe. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>


EDIT: Just saw this <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

3660~~~
Maybe she is clarifying who he is. 'Anthony is not injury. That would be Phil Jones' middle name'

Is this definitely correct? I seen the same thing on Twitter but everyone is retweeting the same image with 84 likes. Has anyone seen it for themselves?

It would be a shame for United if he was out for any length of time, but especially for the player - at his age and given his current form

3662~~~
It's an Instagram post. Her account his private though so I can't check if it's legitimate, I can't imagine why it wouldn't be though.

3663~~~
Anthony is not Ian Dury but he does like to hit me with his rhythm stick thank you for your messages x

3664~~~
I knew the injury wasn't serious the moment there wasn't any follow up about it and when Descamps basically said it was nothing. People love over reacting. 

All the talks about twisted ankles and such were doing my head in, especially since the pessimism was unfounded and some just want to sound over dramatic. 

He'll probably play Saturday unless Van Gaal want to rest him or something but as far as injury goes there is nothing to that.

3665~~~
I've no idea what sort of sick games they were playing but turns out that was the same one.

That headline sounded scary. The article is much better though.

On another note - I have started liking Sport Witness a lot. Its good to have a genuine source compiling the information available. They seem to "get" united fans too.

3671~~~
Sport Witness is quality.Although their headlines can be a tad misleading.

3672~~~
Well because it is run mainly by United fans.

3673~~~
How fragile is our squad if it hangs on the availability of a 19 year old.  Glad to hear its minor.

3674~~~
I mean, thanks for the link and all but that tells us feck all we didn't know already. You could see by picture of the the bandage on his foot earlier in this thread that he'd injured his "coup de pied". I reckon the most likely mechanism was kicking the bottom of someone's boot. Which hurts like bejaysus but rarely breaks bones.

As others have said, the main reason to be reasured is that he only had a bandage/dressing on rather than a cast. Which makes a laceration the most likely damage, rather than any kind of fracture. Unless the French docs made a complete balls of their initial assessment anyway...

3675~~~
Mata is more important to us than Martial IMO, as is De Gea and possibly Smalling. I don't think the squad rest on the availability of Martial at all.

3676~~~
Our entertainment levels do.

3677~~~
No chance is Mata more important than Martial. He's barely shown up the past four or five matches.

3678~~~
Martial has been tepid too recently. It is just he is in his honeymoon phase with the CAF on here after his explosive start.

3679~~~
what are you on about?

3680~~~
Harsh but fair. There's always a marked delay between the change in the caf consensus and the reality of what is happening on the pitch. This is just as true when it comes to unpopular players hitting some form as it is when caf favourites start to experience a bit of a dip.

3681~~~
It's not harsh but fair, it's just a bit of a bizarre criticism. 

I'll give you he's not played particularly well, although he's also been double marked in games since Palace, but tepid is such a bizarre description. He's still been full of running and the most exciting player we have. 

I'd describe someone like Mata's recent performances as 'tepid' but certainly not Martial.

3682~~~
I'd say "not playing particularly well" and "tepid" are much the same thing. If we assume playing well = hot, then better to be rated tepid than cold!

3683~~~
At the risk of getting into the sort of bizarre debate glaston was having yesterday:

I'd put words like tepid in the same category as 'bright' and 'entertaining'. You can be 'bright' and play badly and you can be 'tepid' and play well. It's a term of excitement for me, in football terms (or more accurately a lack of excitement). Martial still does things that excite me, they're just not coming off for him like they were at the start of the season.

3684~~~
To say that he has been average to decent is not bizarre criticism in my book. I would say terming it bizarre is more bizarre. Now we are getting Glaston territory. 

He actually played quite badly against CSKA and was taken off with half an hour to go whilst we were desperate for a goal. That shows you that LVG was not pleased with the performance.

3685~~~
Vs Palace he created our best 2 chances, vs Westbrom he was unlucky not to score and then he won the penalty. He didn't have a great game vs CSKA but he hasn't exactly been average in the other games either (unless you're just talking about that one game)

3686~~~
If he is anywhere near as good as this thread suggests then he has been average by his own standards. Leo Messi's career would be declared over if he only 3 created chances and nearly scored once over the period of five games.

3687~~~
During the last transfer season they helped me keep my sanity. I have been a fan since

3688~~~
RE: Sport Witness

They're the only twitter related media that are worth following tbh. Not only are their articles very good but they also tend to rip other rubbish articles to pieces. A credit to their profession.

3689~~~
He is not Messi, he wasn't average vs Palace or Westbrom, but then he also wasn't brilliant either.

3690~~~
What is it with this website and people only reading like one sentence of a response?

I just find the vocabulary odd, I don't think I've ever heard 'tepid' used as a synonym for 'bad' before, whereas its used frequently for 'uninspiring' or 'unexciting' something which Martial hasn't been. If you'd read to literally the second sentence of my reply to you I said 'I'll give you he's not played particularly well'.

3691~~~
So what's the news on the injury?

3692~~~
Only one of the players that you mentioned scores goals on a regular basis.. He is vital to us without him we have little or no threat in front of goal..

3693~~~
Good thing it's a teenager being judged and not Leo Messi. He was the best attacker vs city on either side. Against palace they set up with an intention to stop mainly him, and he still had a few great moments, and again was our best attacker. Won a penalty on our last game.

Hopefully people don't get under some strange illusion that it's only the first four games where he scored that he played well. He's been class all season barring one or two here and there. Even against Everton he bossed Coleman.

3694~~~
There's a thread dedicated to the injury.

Answer to your question is "there is none".

3695~~~
It would be idiotic for anyone to judge him against Messi. That would be unfair on anyone, including a 19 year old Messi himself.

For a 19 year old under that much expectation, he has been a revelation for us, and even when he has not scored, he's still been quite good for us. He's also created chances during that period that have not been converted by others. He's not perfect, but the kid has been very good for us, and even for his NT team. 

But its the thing around here, every player seems to have unwarranted detractors, even when he has done well, as some people cant help but go against the consensus opinion.

3696~~~
I am not a Martial detractor FFS. I just think that he has been average to decent in recent games and not exactly a decisive player for us. I still think he is a great talent and could be a world class player for us. I actually think he plays within himself at the moment. The hyperbole around him on the CAF does get a little too much I feel though. I agree as well, overall he has been one of our best attacking players this season, probably the best. The strength of this team hasn't been upfront, however. The defence has been the standout for me.

3697~~~
There's a separate thread for his injury? ok lol. Thanks and phew!

3698~~~

Nice little video. First time I heard him speak. Little bit of english at the end, as well.

Favorite players - Brazilian Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Zidane. Couldn't have chosen better.

19 years old <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

3700~~~
When you look at the chances he created for Rooney vs Everton, Rooney vs Wolfsburg, Memphis vs Sunderland (all should have scored) and the Lingard chance vs City (unlucky not to score) he quite easily should have another 3/4 assists to his record this season.

3701~~~
That Rooney miss against Wolfsburg looks worse and worse on each viewing. Awful miss.

3702~~~
Wow, just wow. A special player. 

If Memphis get's his finger out, and we can help Januzaj reach his potential, we could have a very good triumvirate of attackers. With Lingard also impressing, that's four players under 22 with good to world class potential. It's a real shame we just let Januzaj go on loan.

3703~~~
The kid is truly special. Make the right signings over the next 2-3 years and our attack build around him could be absolutely lethal. I love that despite being a striker who plays superbly with his back to goal, he's put it great performances even when he hasn't scored. That's the hallmark of a complete player.

3704~~~
He's the apprentice who's a Sorcerer!

3705~~~
Aside of him being a great player and great lad, it's also great to shut everybody who criticized his transfer fee up.

3706~~~
Indeed

3707~~~
Best thing about that is that he did it on the very first day.

3708~~~
Coleman and Ricardo Rodriguez are one of the best fullbacks in their respective leagues and Martial shitted all over them.

3709~~~
And against Liverpool.

3710~~~
Had an argument today with a Chelsea fan, claiming: Deulofeu has been better than Martial so far this season. There was even a United fan agreeing with him. Naturally, I said they are bonkers but just in case I am massively overrating our little French genius here, what does the caf say to this?

<span style="color: #ffffff">I have to admit, I don't particularly watch Everton every week...</span>

3711~~~
I think we're overrating his overall performances. There's been a huge number of times he has done some genuinely brilliant things and shown a huge, huge amount of promise.

3712~~~
Dont really watch everton but deulofeu has more goals + assists in lesser minutes for everton so probably something in it.

3713~~~
Would you agree with the fact Deulofeu has been more impressive?

3714~~~
I haven't seen enough of him to comment fairly.

3715~~~
Deulofeu is in good form but before that run started he wasn't even guaranteed a place in their starting eleven. I think he played less than half an hour in 7 of their 13 PL games? So no, I'd say Martial has been better.

I can see why neutral fans might argue for Deulofeu, his form has improved recently while Martial's early impact has dimmed. That doesn't make them right though.

3716~~~
Haven't seen much of deulofeu but he's supposed to have been excellent this season. Has to be noted that as much of the hype about martial' season is about the games he didn't score or assist in as the ones he did because his all round game has been so damn good.

3717~~~
<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/> So off to Barcelona in a few seasons?  Btw, nasty looking scar on his left hand.

3718~~~
Just think if we had everyone playing at the top of their games as we have seen.

If we can get Januzaj back playing to the level he was a couple of years ago. What a great attacking group we could have, all young for the future.

---------------------------MARTIAL------------------------

DEPAY---------------------JANUZAJ----------------LINGARD

------------HERRERA-----------------SCHNEIDERLIN---------

Not to mention:
MATA
ROONEY
PEREIRA

We have such a great group of YOUNG players in the team at the moment:
DE GEA
SHAW
SMALLING
JONES
DARMIAN
HERRERA
POWELL
LINGARD
PEREIRA
DEPAY
JANUZAJ
MARTIAL

All between the ages of 18-26

3719~~~
Powell + Lingard but no mention of Wilson or Pearson?

3720~~~
My bad, i genuinely just forgot to mention them.

3721~~~
Don't forget Pereira either, who has a big future for sure. And Wilson who still has potential, just not as much as the others probably. And Shaw is just 20 and he's as good as any 20 year old around (let's just hope he returns as he was).

3722~~~
You'd think our the core of our team could be sorted for the next few years when you add De Gea, Jones, Smalling, Shaw (as you pointed out), Schneiderlin, Darmian all still relatively young, plus the youngsters named before.

3723~~~
During the time I watched, he was non-existent and didn't look like he wanted to make anything happen either.

3724~~~
Forgot he was playing.

3725~~~
Not his best game for us. Unlike others, I didn't feel he was that bad in the 1st half; was a bit off, but still managed to get a couple of decent shots away. He was anonymous in the second half though, which is disappointing since one of his most impressive factors since coming here has been that he's often looked like a breath of fresh air even when the team has been dire. Didn't help that we weren't creating anything for him, though.

3726~~~
Mixed bag in the first half. Non-existent in the second. Kid could do with a break. Almost a quarter of a <b>billion</b> quid spent on new players, no attacking injuries and we can't afford to give him one, despite this poor performance tonight. That's the sort of financial mismanagement that would have shareholders calling for the board to be sacked in a lot of other industries.

3727~~~
Invisible out there today. Had a few chances in the first half, probably should've scored one, but second half I barely remember him touching the ball.

3728~~~
Didn't look ready to play today.

3729~~~
Very poor tonight along with Depay and Lingard.

3730~~~
Stats:

2 shots.
2 on target.
18/26 passes.
8 failed passes were short exchanges around the box.
69.2% pass completion.
2/2 crosses.
1/9 take ons.
1 ball recoveries.
0/1 tackles.
0 interception.
0 clearance.

3731~~~
Watch this lads proformances start to rapidly decline under LvG. He'll strip him of any creativity and have him thinking more about his defensive duties than being creative going forward.

3732~~~
One of his worst for us. Not sure he was entirely fit either. Seemed much more laboured and weaker than anytime I've seen him.

3733~~~
Also it's strange to say this about a 19 year old but we really him to be in form for the last game of the group stage. He's one player who on his day can destroy defenders so to have a chance to qualify we need players like him in top fitness and form.

3734~~~
Dreadful tonight.

First half he ran the channels and stretched the opposition defence on a few occasions, but lost most of his personal duels and made the wrong choices. Second half, he was hopelessly anonymous.

3735~~~
I'd have to agree with Scholes in that he doesn't look like a natural goalscoring striker, doesn't have that natural strikers instinct. Still very young of course, but he seems better playing on the left where he can run at defenders and go past them. Today probably wasn't completely fit, but still. He has huge potential, but I'd prefer if we bought a striker like Kane in who can play alongside Martial, or Martial playing on the left. His off the ball movement in the box has a lot of room for improvement if he wants to become a player who scores 30 goals a season basically.

3736~~~
What are you on about?He has almost zero defensive duty tonight.

3737~~~
Was rubbish tonight and has not sparkled for a few weeks now; honeymoon is well and truly over!  

I'm fine with that, he is a special talent and will soon become invincible.  Hopefully he takes the criticism easily and smokes Vardy at the weekend.

3738~~~
Get Kane in to partner him and we'd be brilliant up top.

3739~~~
He was poor tonight and people can call me a hypocrite but I am cutting him some slack as we have way too much resting on a 19 year old in his first season, that's not his fault, most 19 year olds lack consistency.

3740~~~
Don't see much wrong with what you're saying. I think we all know he's not going to be magnificent in every game, and that he'll have poor spells. Considering the impact he has made since coming here, it's perfectly understandable.

3741~~~
He has defensive duties every game under LVG cause I can really hear him saying, not tonight Tony just do the feck you want. its a pity LvG didn't squeeze the balls out of all the forward players then maybe they would play with a little more free spirit

3742~~~
People were saying 'get him up top, it'll make a big difference'. Lets be honest, it hasnt done feck all really. The tactics are obviously stifling our attacking players.

3743~~~
He was very poor tonight, but he's a 19 year old kid and his form should be inconsistent. I genuinely feel sorry for this guy and Memphis because there's a hell of a burden on their shoulders and it's unfair.

3744~~~
Was really surprised he started and I guess that shows the desperation we are in. I feel sorry for him as he looks like a spark that isnt allowed to explode.

3745~~~
We are suffering from relying too much on him, he has played nonstop since he came and needs a rest.

3746~~~
Even when he doesn't play well, he still manages to be a threat. Memphis needs to learn from Martial.

3747~~~
It didn't take long for this turgid side to make Martial look clueless.

3748~~~
Didn't look fully fit to me at all. Not sure why he had to displace Depay up front.

3749~~~
Poor, but perhaps he was unfit.

It shouldn't come to this position that we rely so heavily on him.

3750~~~
Some people are extremely naive and simple minded. Playing up front is tougher than on the wing for a young player who likes to run at players.

3751~~~
Looked quite terribly tonight to be honest. I thought he always tried tot do to much with the ball, dribbled aimlessly, passing wasn't that great, not his best from him.

3752~~~
Bingo.

3753~~~
It's good to see most fans having perspective on him, he's a fantastic talent but the price we paid doesn't alter the fact he'll have the same issues most 19 year olds have, our big problem is the attack is so bad we've started to rely on him and expect from him immediately.

3754~~~
I think he'd be best in a system like Neymar is for Barca. You should go all out for Kane and make him your main Striker and possibly a very good RW unless Memphis is given a chance on that side.

3755~~~
I'd keep him on the left for the time being, seems to get more of the ball there and you can tell he enjoys it a bit more. We've got plenty of time to ease him in as a striker if that's our route.

3756~~~
Brilliant dummy that Lingard should have scored from, mind.

3757~~~
So the consensus about his best position has moved to left wide-forward instead of an actual #9?

3758~~~
Need a big performance from him if we want to grAb three points.

3759~~~
He is opening up the game for us with his dribbling. We need to get him on the ball more.

3760~~~
Too bad Young has been fecking up easy through balls over and over again.

3761~~~
This kid is basically our only striking threat and he's feeding off scraps. And also because he has useless Wayne next to him he has more than one Leicester defender on him as Rooney is no threat to them whatsoever.

3762~~~
Things just weren't coming off for him but there were sparks of his ability, albeit not a fan of him on that right side.

3763~~~
He was rubbish. Memphis wasnt great, but he did more in his little cameo than martial. Young offered more despite being crap.
He is our best striker.. but he did nothing today.

3764~~~
Worst game yet probably.

3765~~~
I only saw the second half but Memphis didn't do anything, neither did Young. Martial probably was no better but the whole team sucked in the 2nd half.

3766~~~
Feel for the lad, has no one on his wavelength when in attack.

3767~~~
He put a ball in that found Mata in space inside the box and got into a goal scoring position where he hit it over the bar.
Not much, not perfect, but 2 chances..

Martial on the other hand... did nothing. Had a poor game. Happens.

3768~~~
At one point we had a counter on, and rather than take his man on and cross or shoot, when he was on the wing he cuts inside and kills it dead. It seems its not just the system, the attacking player are just not doing their job as well.

3769~~~
Judging by how you explained he would have to dribble in that case too which isn't safest option either. He is also not known for his crossing technique so again that wouldn't be his job to do.

3770~~~
Martial's trying to do too much because he simply isn't get the service. More often than not, his goals will come from him taking on 2 or 3 players, but he shouldn't have to do that. It's a big part of why Rooney, and all of our other attacking players who haven't got that ability to beat 2/3 players (i.e. Messi, Neymar, Ronaldo) don't score, because we're asking them to do too much when they get the ball.

3771~~~
Regardless of that, his decision making was poor for the most part and he's very reluctant to try anything these days either. Has to be the van Gaal effect.

3772~~~
Amazing that two posts within a matter of seconds with one saying that he is trying too much stuff and the other saying that he isn't trying too many things because of the Van Gaal effect <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3773~~~
I am starting to think that the left wing is actually the best position for him, if we can get a quality striker then Martial would probably be shifted to the left.

3774~~~
He was very good in the period between Leicester's goal and half time. He was making things happen, but Young kept fecking up the through balls behind their defense, which really pissed me off. They were relatively easy passes.

He wasn't very good in the second half, but our whole play was slower, for some reason. The lack of urgency in our game cripples Martial more than others.

3775~~~
He's been van Gaalised.

3776~~~
It helps when your teammates are able to make things happen. Mata, despite his stats, is very underwhelming, Young is devoid of creativity, Memphis has the legs of a 32 year old (as in slow in everything he does) and Rooney...nuff said.

3777~~~
Much like memphis and januzaj, I think hes been "philosophied". They all came into the team looking exciting, but are taking less risks now and being more "safe" with the ball.

3778~~~
He was our only threat in the first half but faded in the second, playing with Rooney and Mata must have him losing the will to live as there's rarely ever a forward pass coming from them and neither can run with the ball so he's isolated.

3779~~~
I thought he was crap today, kept losing control too easy.

3780~~~
Get him Harry Kane to partner him in the summer.

He's more of a creator than an out and out goal scorer at the moment.

3781~~~
I like the fact that he tries too make things happen. Posters moan on here that we pass backwards or don't take risks then criticise Martial for running down blind alleys or giving the ball away.

I would prefer him to run at defenders and lose it most times, but that one time leave him for dead and create something like he did on the byline against Simpson. His pace and directness actually opens the game up for us, and was only time Leicester were out of position. 

When we have the ball you can literally predict 9 times out of 10 what the next move or pass will be, at least Martial provides something different and can be unpredictable.

3782~~~
We are slowly sucking the footballing life out of him. Soon, we will start calling him average or overhyped like what happened to Januzaj.

<span style="color: #ffffff">Just kidding...but he does not look like himself anymore. He looks fat and more uglier.</span>

3783~~~
It's probably a result of just having different ideas of football. I like aggressive, high tempo football with players showing a willingness to take risks. I love winning more than anything, but prefer it to be done that way. I understand it's not always possible and wouldn't play that way at all times as a manager as well, but generally, it pisses me off how careful our players are, especially those who aren't supposed to be.

EDIT: That's why I prefer Luis Enrique's Barca to Pep's.

3784~~~
Depends what sort of football we play and who the other front 6 players are.

Sometimes you're better off having a 9 who likes to peel wide in order to run at players and has the benefit of leaving the middle open at times for other players to attack that space or just leave the CBs with nobody to mark until you've gotten in behind a bit wider and they're in a panic anyways.

I agree that under Van Gaal, if the other team sits back and we play 4 at the back, Martial might perform best at LW. However, the same is true for Memphis and maybe even Young, so that's a bit of a problem.

3785~~~
Martial doesn't appear to have much pace.

3786~~~
I think someone joked earlier.
When he first came to MUFC, he couldn't understand anything LVG was saying, so he played on instinct and scored goals.
Now that he has understood LVG's philosophy, he has now stopped scoring and prefers to play safe.

3787~~~
Some of you just come to your own conclusions and ignore the truth.

Martial is still playing how he always did, he dribbled more than enough times today. Our biggest issue is the fact that we don't get him on the ball enough.

It sounds silly to say cos he is so young, but our attacking play should be geared to maximise the most out of him.

3788~~~
Well that's not true.  Probably one of the top 3 fastest players on the team along with Shaw and Smalling.

3789~~~
What? Go back and watch him blow past Simpson like he isn't even there then.

Anyway, I thought he was average. Did some good things but also tried to do too much at times. Needs to work on his decision making obviously, but he's young so that will happen. Was infuriating that Young kept over-hitting simple passes through to him.

3790~~~
I thought he played well.

3791~~~
I did too. I thought that if we were going to create anything, it was gonna come from him down our right side. He was the only one of our 'attackers' that I got excited about when he got the ball.

3792~~~
To be fair, he does <i>look </i>slow. He might be running at 100 mph but his technique gives the illusion he's jogging.

3793~~~
Yeah I can understand that. He kind of glides past people.

3794~~~
He's beginning to look frustrated and you can see that by the number of fouls he's giving away. Needs a goal and a great game pretty soon. Feel for him. He's playing with dross.

3795~~~
My favourite moment was when he took the ball, and he had Young on the left in acres of space and after second or two he was like, feck that I am not doing that shit passing him again and tried to dribble two players himself. Even if he lost the ball I still liked it because he is obviously fed up with both Young and our style of play. Of course van Gaal will criticise him for that though.

3796~~~
looks like this bubble has now burst...

3797~~~
In a perfect world he wouldn't be starting every game. Teams are already doubling up on him and he and Rooney are never near each other for support. Shame we can't bring him on the last 15 minutes when games are stretched and defenses are tired.

3798~~~
Think he needs to go back on the left. There's always 3 men on him when he's in the middle.

3799~~~
Yeah and Memphis needs a run upfront anyway but for it to have any remote chance of success it would have to be in the absence of Rooney and Mata. If we had a good manager, after what we saw of Memphis at Watford, we'd have seen;

------------Memphis-------
Martial--Herrera*--Lingard

as an attacking quad more often.
*I know he is injured but even when he attains full fitness he will still spend a few weeks out getting back the "match rhythm" that Rooney doesn't seem to need. I'd even try Perreira in the hole, what would we lose either way because we know we won't be getting anything from Rooney anyway!
Atm Martial and Memphis could do with exchanging roles for a sustained period, if only to maintain their confidence, because Memphis has looked better through the middle whilst Martial excels when he has isolated the full back. It's a tactic I feel we should try.

3800~~~
I feel sorry for him because although he didn't really offer a lot up top for us he just wasn't getting any decent service from those in behind him.

3801~~~
He'll be fine.

3802~~~
That would be a fantastic thing if the other players in close proximity could take advantage of the space that causes. Yesterday we had Young, Rooney and Mata who for all different reasons, did not take advantage of anything.

3803~~~
Are you the same guy that said Shaw looked slow too <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3804~~~
Play him together with Lingard and Memphis in a front three of 4-3-3 perhaps?

3805~~~
The only one looking like make something happen. We're entirely reliant on him, which is obviously not going to work out for us over the course of the season.

3806~~~
Needs support. He's such a talent forced to play with the likes of Rooney and Mata.

3807~~~
Still our best attacking player, he just can't do it all himself. Looked more lively with Memphis and lingard around him, needs people to give him space and isolate players 1v1. 

The 352 is such a poor formation with our players.

3808~~~
Played pretty well. As did young I thought. Our two brightest attackers. But we need a few more stepping up. Also, not sure why we've stopped playing the ball into his feet with his back to defenders given he's brilliant at that. It seems to go to him more in the air in recent weeks and he's not going to win those outright. If we had another centre forward I'd have moved him to the right instead of Mata so he could see more of the ball.

3809~~~
We need him on the left, upfront and right.

3810~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> that's actually true. I just keep waiting for him to get the ball and always feel he's not getting on it enough. To be fair, I thought young did pretty well yesterday too. Need Herrera back to give some quality in central areas.

3811~~~
To be fair, his end product has dropped from the initial days. He is looking for more passes than dribbles, (and needs to work on his passing) and that sees him venture less and less into the opposition's penalty box or whereabouts. A striker should do more.

Best attacking player we have, though. Hands down.

3812~~~
He looks really really tired to be honest. His energy levels just dosen't look the same to me. I think he should get the week off, no point in running him down.

3813~~~
Looks tired and also too cautious, looked very poor in that 1vs1 situation, but we are also not feeding him properly. Pairing him with Fellaini up top is also not a good fit.

3814~~~
Ehhh, he came alive for the chance he had, problem is he keeps drifting to the channels and dropping deep because we never find him otherwise.

3815~~~
That's why I said we don't feed him well either.

3816~~~
Just struggling to get into matches lately. Maybe because he is young or maybe the system.

3817~~~
He has absolutely feck all space to play with. Every time he get's the ball he's got three around him. Everyone knows he's our only threat, so just mark him.

3818~~~
He's being crowded out because teams know if they stop him they stop us. 

Should create more space for others, but the qualities not there to exploit it.

3819~~~
His form has dropped massively since his explosive start. He use to get past players with ease. Now, I do not see that in his game anymore.

3820~~~
I've seen him do it plenty of times since then. A far bigger problem is us not getting any sort of decent attacking ball to him.

3821~~~
Just put in on a plate for Fellaini. You know how that went.

3822~~~
Just created that chance completely by himself, great dribble, great movement, great pass.

3823~~~
He is excellent and we are fecking shite.

3824~~~
The kid is a feckin warrior, and the only one consistently trying to beat a man.

3825~~~
Yep. If we had another attacking player who could step up like Martial we'd find things a lot easier, but we're so easy to stop because Martial is the only real threat right now.

3826~~~
It's sad that we rely on a 19 year old for bringing dribbling quality, hold up play and goals. Should have done better with his chance but again the only attacker with genuine top class ability.

3827~~~
And suddenly when Memphis comes on and creates havoc, Martial suddenly comes to life as well.

Overall a much better second half, created the best chance of the game almost entirely by himself, should've probably scored, but I didn't think his looks on goal were that clear.

3828~~~
Yep. Looks like he needs someone to bring him to life, someone with a bit of speed and creativity.

3829~~~
For all the love in he botched our best chance. He needs to score those.

3830~~~
Erm... really?

3831~~~
The best chance still belonged to Fellaini right in front of goal.

3832~~~
I'm not really being too critical of him because he obviously has talent but for the price we paid you'd be wanting a greater output.

3833~~~
Until Memphis came on, he was our most dangerous attacking player. He should've put one of his chances away, but you can't expect much more when he's constantly being crowded by several players and doesn't receive a lot of good passes. Carrick was the first guy who could really feed him some proper passes.

3834~~~
He missed a great chance but at least he's a threat, the problem is he was our only threat until Memphis came on which means teams can focus on him and mark him more intensely.

3835~~~
I think you can, specially the chance in the second half, at the very least he had to hit the target.

3836~~~
True enough. I just get the feeling Martial is a little languid and only comes alive every now and then. He frustrates me bacause I think he plays within himself.

3837~~~
Not like before. His finishing might have been overrated at the beginning as he does not look clinical like a natural striker in front of goal. However, like I stated before, perhaps he is just off form. Class is perminant as I see glimpse even when we are playing awful.

3838~~~
Which I stated just before the bolded part but nonetheless in terms of overall attacking player, he does a lot more than the rest upfront, except for Memphis who was great when he came on.

3839~~~
Clearly he's very good in 1 on 1s but his finisihing in other situations needs to improve or he needs to get better at bringing other players into play in dangerous positions. Very young through. It's a shame we are so reliant on him.

3840~~~
There's a reason he drifts out so much.

Name ONE player, who plays consistently well (or enough i.e Herrera/Mata) in the MIDDLE, that can control a ball, makes runs, hold the ball and receive on the turn? 

We play balls wide because we're afraid of losing the ball in the middle of the pitch and getting countered. Martial can do all those things above but he will have 1-3 players on him AND when he does get those balls in the middle, who is he going to pass it back and what is he supposed to do with it? 

We NEED Herrera/Mata there behind Martial with Lingard and Depay/Young on the wings.

3841~~~
You shouldn't. Young players will always be inconsistent in front of goal.

As for his peformances other than that, very happy with him today. Our attack is poor but this kid is pretty much the main reason to get excited about watching us.

3842~~~
Really unlucky not to score today. Would have been a nice birthday present.

He is the only bright spot in our attack. Does a pretty good job all on his own considering he is the only competent attacker in the team.

3843~~~
I think you always expect improvement from any player (I know I do at least). The degree of expectation is what should always be different between the players depending on their age, experience and tons of other parameters.

3844~~~
Improvment yes, but surely that's in terms of years not weeks? I would expect martial to be better in 17/18 than he is this season. Might not happen as there are always ups and downs, but yeah that's the progress he hopefully makes.

My point was that if you're going to expect a 19 year old to be clinical in front of goal you're setting yourself up for disappointment.

3845~~~
In terms of months yes and he has in some way. He already looks stronger on the ball.

3846~~~
Agreed 100%.

He is young, he is far from the finished article and so he is getting an easy ride here.
Had Rooney played like Martial did today (ie. average), people would say that Rooney is done.
The simple truth is that we cannot rely on a 19 year old to lead our line on his own. He needs another striker with him, who is at his absolute peak.
He is our No.9. His job is to score goals which means he needs to score. I know its harsh, but this is MUFC.

And for those saying that he always has 2 players on him - this applies to all top players. Aguero, Suarez, Ronaldo, Messi, etc. It's upto the player himself to make it happen.
I want to remind people that he is playing for MUFC (not a lesser club). All our great players of the past have either raised their game to match expectation OR have been moved on (ie. not good enough).
I said in another thread, that if a top striker was on the pitch for us today, he'd have scored 1 goal at least.

I agree. But at MUFC, no striker gets 2 years to prove himself. Generally speaking if you can't deliver, you get moved on.
Wellbeck was a young player, who was given chances, but could not score many goals. Result: SOLD.

In any case, I hope that he does score a few goals, because if this goal drought continues, his confidence could spiral downwards and if this happens, he may never recover while at MUFC.

3847~~~
I thought Martial actually did really well, just his finishing was a bit off. Looked dangerous throughout.

I'm going to refuse to blame any of our players for their productivity though as long as Van Gaal is here. Whatever tactics he has us playing, it ruins anyones output. Hell, Messi and Ronaldo would probably struggle to score half of what they do now if they played for us.

3848~~~
Or you could look at Rooney who was inconsistent in front of goal for a long time. Martial isn't in danger of not proving himself, and nor is he in danger of not delivering or being moved on. He's more Rooney/Ronaldo than Welbeck. Like young Rooney he is excellent even when he doesn't score. Like those two, he will be given patience, and his work in progress phase will be one where he continues contribute even if he isn't prolific like all kids aren't. Nothing in guaranteed in life, but right now that's pretty much where it's at.

The second paragraph is laughable. "He may never recover". We've probably got the best teenager in the game at our club. He's someone we're going to build teams. Not sure what the reason for worry is?

3849~~~
Absolutely nothing wrong our tactics. LVG has to ensure we get goals form the team but we played with the intensity that everyone wants.

3850~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Sure.

3851~~~
Well its no wonder that pretty much every single one of our players scores less and attempts fewer shots with us then they did under their previous managers. Its not a coincidence when it happens to every single player.

3852~~~
I'm not saying it's a coincidence or unrelated. I just don't think absolving the players of all blame is right, either. They get most of the praise when they score a chance, not the manager. Should get at least some of the blame when they miss one, as well. This is especially relevant today.

3853~~~
We're going to burn him out, aren't we? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

This is no way for a 20 year old to be learning his trade - we should be gradually building him up, not by making him our most important attacker and putting all the burden on him but by easing him into the squad - like we did with Ronaldo. Sadly, this is not possible with the players we have.

PS. Happy birthday Anthony.

3854~~~
Oh I know, I'm not absolving all of them of blame, just that I'm not blaming the players too much for their overall output. Our leading scorer has what, 5 goals? Put these exact players in a different style and they'd have twice that.

3855~~~
We had 21 shots today and one was on goal so the problem certainly wasn't that we don't shoot.

3856~~~
Today is the very big exception. Today it was just the finishing and if we played like this in an attacking sense, fans wouldnt complain. What usually happens is we have around 10 shots, a few from distance, but really nothing to good. That's the reason we've drawn 7 of our last 10 games. We just don't do enough to win consistently, though today we should've.

3857~~~
Ronaldo played 50 games for us in the season he turned 20.

3858~~~
I thought he improved considerably in the 2nd half. Unfortunately in these close matches he needs to take those half-chances. He did set-up one or two others though. Definitely one of our best.

3859~~~
How did did we bought him for?

Well done to lvg for splashing all the transfer fund on a unproven promising youngster where what we need is a proven goal-scorer.

Time will tell if he will come good but in recent matches, he has gone off the boil, no where near potential balon dor winner

3860~~~
And that is a problem ?

3861~~~
Where the white text

3862~~~
Happy birthday

3863~~~
This has to be a joke, everything that is wrong with football fans in a singular post!

3864~~~
I hope we sell him for nothing to Montpellier next Summer, the useless idiot.

3865~~~
The guy is going to be a beast but he's just hit the inevitable barren patch, and this is the point where we needed a proven goal scorer to to take the pressure off him.

It's not his fault he's still learning his trade and missing a few chances, he could do with a break imo and a few starts off the bench, but sadly we just haven't got that luxury.

3866~~~
fecking yes! Important goal!

3867~~~
Black Ice.

3868~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> What is this shit?

3869~~~
You can sense the Wolfsburg fans were scared of him whenever he touched the ball. Only with him they cheered when he lost the ball, purely out of relief.

3870~~~
Had a good game, held his position well most of the time and took his goal well, I am very pleased with what we have seen from him in his United career so far.

3871~~~
I noticed how he immediately made runs after passing the ball expecting his teammate (Mata?) to pass it back but that didn't happen enough.

3872~~~
He played well, we saw what he can do when the ball is played into his feet.

The trouble is, most of his teammates mistake him for a 7 foot beast with the touch and control of Messi and hoof balls into him, and expect him to do the rest.

He needs support in the form of a proven goalscorer. This is a massive burden for a 19 year old. If I was LVG I'd throw a lot of money on someone like Lukaku.

3873~~~
Good game tonight, him and Mata linked up well for his goal. I'd like to see more of them playing together.

3874~~~
He seems to link up really well with Memphis. Outside of that though, we lack the players who are willing to take the necessary risks in order to feed him for his runs. While Mata provided the assist to his goal, that's about the only time he's really put him through and to be honest the passing lane was simply wide open.

3875~~~
Our most exciting player to watch. The one that looks the most capable of making something happen. Reminds me of Januzaj two seasons ago. You just wanted him to get on the ball and run, in hope that he'd wriggle through. And even when he'd get tackled, you'd just want him to do it again. Because where else are the goals going to come from? OG, it seems.

3876~~~
The shining light of LVG's tenure here.

Martial will be one of the Prem's best players in 1-2 seasons.

3877~~~
Happens nearly every game.

He beats one or two players, plays a quick pass expecting it to be returned to him, but the receiving player takes the ball and makes a harmless pass to someone else and the momentum of that move is gone. 

I said it in another thread, we hardly ever play 1-2's its such a rarity.

3878~~~
I shudder to think where we would be without him.

3879~~~
Yes exactly that, I was looking for the term 1-2's.

3880~~~
He's so good for his age. 

I liked the front four today and hope we can see them play together more often.

3881~~~
He's just brilliant. I can't wait to see him with better attackers surrounding him.

3882~~~
Our best player by miles.

3883~~~
Was class today. He's going to be such a good player, already is a very good one. Gave his all but we can't rely on him at his age. He's going to burn out by the end of the season.

3884~~~
The only attacker worthy of wearing the shirt at this point in time.

3885~~~
I love this kid. He's got everything to be one of the world's best. 

This.

3886~~~
Or under a better manager.

3887~~~
Yup.

3888~~~
Just 20 years old! Obviously there will be games and spells where he disappoints but that is normal. A constant threat tonight I thought. His pace troubled Dante and Naldo.

3889~~~
He deserved more tonight, he looked truly gutted at the end of the match. He try's to do so much on his own but gets very little support from those around him. Scholes is right though we shouldn't be relying on a 20 year old as our main goal threat.

3890~~~
Needs better team-mates. Players who actually have a bit of creativity and trust in their technique.
Someone with similar attributes to Sterling would suit him really well. From one side at least. And then a proper goalscorer on the other side of him.

Get in a technically gifted midfielder who isn't afraid to zip balls into him as soon as the opportunity presents itself (Gündoğan), and we're laughing.

It's all about getting in players on his wavelength, who trust their ability to pass/dribble into (and from tight areas).

3891~~~
Could easily get 15 + goals this season which would be fantastic, the only issue is we do not have the senior player who is banging in the 25 goals + and helping him out.

3892~~~
Really felt for him at the end of the game. When he signed for us this season, he can't have envisaged being entrusted with the responsibility of carrying our attack. It's quite alarming how his technique is a few levels above the rest of our team. Pretty much the only player that doesn't look fazed receiving the ball in tight spaces.

3893~~~
Actually feel sorry for the guy. He needs teammated on his wavelength.

3894~~~
Now that's just irrational.

3895~~~
That's she shittiest bit about the whole thing. Normally, a 20yr old kid signing for a club like Man Utd would be amazed by the technique and ability of those around him. Maybe even realise how big the gulf is. It could well be the other way around here.

3896~~~
Yep, in most cases, you have your 20 year old looking up to other players and trying to impress them and all that. Martial is our most talented player and best performing attacking player already. That's just not good for him or for us.

3897~~~
Hopefully we will get the next 2 transfer windows right and fix that. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

3898~~~
What really grated me was that there was a point in the first half when Martial played the ball to Lingard, made some movement clearly indicating he wanted the give and go, then Lingard took an age to notice and passed it back into midfield/defence. It's actually a problem with many of our players, who are either unable to play that way, or they are scared to try. Martial however, always seems to look for these sort of plays which implies that some players are just unwilling to or would rather the safe option that makes life easy for the opponents. You see lots of teams play like this, heck look at Wolfsburg's second goal, imagine Max Kruse was Lingard for a second when Draxler played that ball to him, he'd probably play it backwards to Varela.

3899~~~
embarrassing post

3900~~~
Lukaku has been brilliant this season.Its no longer just the goals with him either, brings a lot of his teammates into play too. Martial could feed of that imo.

Why do you it's irrational?

3901~~~
Both are no.9 and equally deserving of being the main man. We should rather look for a pacey, tricky wide forward and a no.10 with consistent end product.

3902~~~
Griezmann!

3903~~~
fair point, I was thinking more of a front two.

3904~~~
Griezmann plays the same position as Martial, he isn't a wide forward, people need to get him out of their head, the player we should be going for is Reus.

3905~~~
seems rather injury prone

3906~~~
Reus has been underwhelming for the past 1.5 seasons, whether because of injuries or other factors. His last good season was 13/14. Mkhitaryan and Aubameyang have been easily outperforming Reus this season, in Aubameyang's case he was outperforming Reus last season too when Reus wasn't injured.

3907~~~
I think they would make a great pairing, for both club and country. Griezmann as the second striker and Martial as the number 9. They could both interchange. The only problem is a lack of heading option.

Realistically though, we need to bring in some top class wise men; it just seems that there aren't that many out there that are available.

3908~~~
I agree that we are lacking top class wise men, both on the pitch and off it

3909~~~
Agreed. Actually some wide men would also be good.

3910~~~
Injury prone player who only has eyes for Barcelona

3911~~~
One of the reasons we need to bring in an experienced striker is to help Martial learn. Look at what that short stint H.Larrson loan deal did for us (our attacking players). You could see he had an influence.

We have Martial who is a talent, but obviously needs to continue improving and I honestly dont think he will if we dont help him in that regards. Coaching can take him so far, but working with and playing with just as good if not better strikers will teach him a thing or two. Plus hes only 20. We risk burning him out long term cos we cant afford to rest / sub him.

I also think it shows how crazy we (LVG) was when he was on a goal scoring run, then suddenly just put him out left to accommodate Rooney.

3912~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iFW8s6MYin8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
Such a <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>-worthy player. It's going to be so exciting watching him grow.

3913~~~
Probably the best teenager I've seen at United. Going to become the best player in the world at some point in the next 3/4 years, no doubt.

3914~~~
Agreed. We need to have some top quality strikers around him to help him learn the nuances of the role. He needs to work on the runs he makes and having another striker that makes those runs would help Martial to improve.

3915~~~
I hear Ibrahimovic is available this summer. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

3916~~~
Nah. Rooney takes it for me n

3917~~~
There's quite a lot of doubt actually.

3918~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/wjo9" width="560"></iframe>

3919~~~
Was almost the perfect blend of Bergkamp and Gattuso! Scalpel and bludgeon in equal measure!

3920~~~
He's human after all. Bad miss but harder than it looked. 

His dribbling in the box was pretty damn impressive.

Needs to take it up a level second half. Goals in this game for him.

3921~~~
What is it, one goal in the league since September? Flashy dribbling will only get you so far.

3922~~~
He's very economical with his movement isn't he? That's something missing at the moment for me, doesn't seem to make the right runs frequently enough or have that anticipation in the box. I'm sure it'll come in time.

3923~~~
We're running him into the ground and it's only going to get worse over the festive period. I don't think anyone expected him to be playing so much so soon.

3924~~~
Should've scored today granted, but you can't blame him when he's been our only player who actually looks to create chances for himself or others since he's come in basically.

3925~~~
Needs to put a bit more effort into chasing down the ball and trying to make chances for himself for me . Looks disinterested at times.

Other than that great dribbling again, hopefully his game comes together and more of these dribbles lead to something. Needs more service from his team mates as well though it must be said.

3926~~~
If and when we sign other worthy attacking players, the extra space for Martial will make us very dangerous.

3927~~~
He can't be expected to carry the attack on his own.

Once he has a teammate on the same wavelength he will be some force to deal with.

3928~~~
Some nice footwork at times and got into a couple of decent positions, but not his day.

3929~~~
Was very poor I thought. Obviously it will happen as he is young though.

3930~~~
He probably should have scored, but then again, he shouldnt be relied upon to get goals and carry our attack in his first season where we arent even giving him any minutes to rest.

Agreed. Add some experience, and competition and it will do him and the team a whole lot of good.

3931~~~
He still has that rare ability to carry the ball past defenders with ease, even if his finishing has gone off a bit. He looks like a dangerous but young forward who has all the tools but hasn't quite figured out how to use them most effectively yet. It's our own fault for expecting him to score all our goals.

3932~~~
I think you can see the pressure getting to him. When he was first signed he didn't show any emotion after doing something, whether it was good or bad. But now after he misses a chance or makes a mistake I can see him getting down on himself. It's really unfortunate that we are relying so heavily on him.

3933~~~
His close control is exceptional but I think eventually he'll be better off as a wide forward in the role Neymar plays right now than as an out and out striker.

3934~~~
Some brilliant foot work spoiled by bad finishing.IMO he played at the right position,i would say he need to be played more at this position even when Rooney returns.

3935~~~
He's a really mediocre ball striker. There's nothing behind his efforts.

3936~~~
He needs to work on shooting practice. The rest of his game already ranges from ok to very good. He needs more venom in his attempts.

3937~~~
We are over using him and that's LVG's fault due to not signing enough strikers in the first place.

3938~~~
This.

3939~~~
Of course not. He is 20 and not even at the club for half a year, it would also help if he wasn't our only competent attacker atm.

3940~~~
Thing about his dribbling is that he has tried to initiate 1-2's plenty of times from what I've seen but the likes of Depay, Lingard and especially Mata somehow do not return the ball to him enough.

3941~~~
His ball control and dribbling is there, but need to improve his finishing.

3942~~~
His ability to escape from tight spaces is ridiculous. Is he related to Houdini?

3943~~~
his finishing is actually pretty good, its not his fault that he gets 1 chance per game....

3944~~~
Is that something you can actually improve at this stage of your career? Souness said Sterling lacks power in his shots but can improve that with training, but I found that a bit odd. I can't think of any players that have developed a more powerful strike later in this professional career.

3945~~~
You can always improve your shooting technique, but the power's either there or it's not.

3946~~~
Memphis has shown glimpses of being on the same wave-length but they have not had much time together and the players don't have much confidence right now.

3947~~~
I honestly don't know, it is his most obvious weakness at the moment. Just like <a class="username" data-user="80030, @ADJUDICATOR" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/80030/">@ADJUDICATOR</a> said, with better technique his shots would already start to cause more trouble.

3948~~~
I still think he's performed better when he's come from the wing. He has so much more space over there.

3949~~~
Mata in behind him would be perfect.  Look at the goal in Wolfsburg, that's where Mata should be all the time, not on the right wing where he's not suited to the requirements of a winger.

3950~~~
I like him being in the centre and going out to the right to get the ball, it works because it pulls apart the defence and allows other players to run into the box whilst he creates something. Its what he did against Wolfsburg but Rooney missed the chance. He can do the same on the left with Memphis and the no.10 running into the middle, hopefully our attackers learn how to interchange better, could be good tactic.

3951~~~
He was there last game and he did absolutely nothing. Mata needs replacing just as much as we need a pacey winger to supplement Marital.

3952~~~
This lad is a little gem. Which needs some polishing

3953~~~
Probably bit late and already posted, but this cheered me up.

3954~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3955~~~
caption contest. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3956~~~
And they said he shows no emotions.

3957~~~
This, especially if our next manager has us playing fast counter attacking football.

3958~~~
He will improve his finishing, nothing that hard work won't iron out. Rooney was similar at a young age and he ended up pretty good at scoring, just a shame the rest of his game took a nosedive

3959~~~
Mata has had enough chances and has proved on many occasions now that he isn't good enough.

3960~~~
I'm inclined to agree sadly. Thought we had our own David Silva when we signed him, such a shame.

3961~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

3962~~~
He's playing kind of deep today, would be nice to see him up front, making runs rather than right-mid, or whatever his position is on paper.

3963~~~
Only player today with a bit of quality. 

Incredible feet. Did the same against Bournemouth without the goal to finish it off.

3964~~~
Imagine United's attack if this guy's last minute transfer didn't happen.

3965~~~
The wrong man is on £300k/week

3966~~~
He seems to be our best playmaker as well as best striker, ridiculous really.

3967~~~
His close control is so so good.

3968~~~
This stinks of Fulham at home in the Moyes era.

3969~~~
The only bright spark today.

3970~~~
I only hope that this guys is here when we actually appoint someone who likes to play positive football

3971~~~
Very quick footed with nice tight control for the goal, still not sure where his position is at the moment.

3972~~~
His best position is at no9. Anywhere else would be a talent wasted.

3973~~~
Statistically our best player.

3974~~~
Our only bright light. The only player currently at the club, when it comes to our attack, that I think is good enough if we want to build a world class team again.

3975~~~
We played him on the feckin right wing. In a 433 as part of the left three I can sort of understand, but feckin right wing.

And no shock, we push him up front and he scores.

Its just mind boggling.

3976~~~
It's crazy to think that he's not being considered as our number one striker now because he should be.

3977~~~
He is our No.1 striker and LVG knows it.
But Rooney is err...

3978~~~
...Shit?

3979~~~
Absolute class this lad. Far too much responsibility on his shoulders right now. He's the only one looking capable of pulling something off.

3980~~~
He's world class. Looking jaded at times, but he should never have to be playing this many games in his debut season.

3981~~~
The whole attack needs reinvigorating, apart from this lad of course, he's magic.

3982~~~
Missed the match, watched his highlights and didn't get disappointed. He's the bright spot of the season.

3983~~~
Any gifs of his goal? Can't bring myself to watch MOTD.

3984~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/5csq" width="560"></iframe>

Decent touch, neat footwork and very good finish considering the pressure.

3985~~~
Thanks. He really is a class act.

3986~~~
There would be no reason, other than it being Manchester United, to watch us if we didn't have this kid.

3987~~~
Sad but pretty much true. To think he was a last minute 'gamble' in the summer. I knew our summer transfer activity was bad but it's turned out even worse than I feared.

3988~~~
Need to watch a closeup slow-motion video of the goal to truly appreciate the beauty of the goal. So much quicker of thought than everyone else around him.

3989~~~
I'm looking forward to watching this player for years to come. Given his age and current abilities, his potential is very exciting. Imagine him in a truly attacking team that plays with pace and aggressiveness!

3990~~~
It's just insane.

3991~~~
It makes no sense. Our most potent attacker is played in the position he's least comfortable playing in. The thought process behind it is "special".

3992~~~
Erm why not? 

Luke Shaw played every game for Southampton in his teen years. Theres no age for quality.

3993~~~
Pushing him out of position in order to accommodate Rooney is an utter disgrace.

An absolute fecking disgrace.

3994~~~
Yup, shoving him away from left wing/#9 to fit two inferior players in those positions is just fecking mental.

3995~~~
Its absolutely inexcusable.

LVG should be sacked for that alone. I genuinely fear for Martial's progress if we stick with LVG.

3996~~~
"captain shall always play"

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

3997~~~
I would understand if we were moving him around to accommodate Messi. But fecking Rooney? Come on!

3998~~~
Far too much responsibility being placed on him at the moment as the only creative outlet in such an enormous team. Luke Shaw never had to deal with anything remotely similar, not to mention the price tag.

3999~~~
I like him more on the left then anywhere else really. He gets too isolated up top because of how we play, while out on the left he gets involved a lot more often and he can be a constant threat with his dribbling. When he's our best player in any of the front 4 positions, it doesn't really matter where you play him, he'll still put in good performances. I'm all for playing him where we'll have the best team overall, or have him the most involved.

4000~~~
I was thinking the same thing during the Moyes season with Januzaj.

4001~~~
For all the outcry i would actually like to see him get a run on the right. It would take some of the pressure off him and i think he could still be pretty dangerous out there after a few games to get a feel for the position.

Playing Rooney up top and Mata in behind is the only real option we have to get them both back in form, might not work but it's worth a try. If we continue with Rooney in behind and Mata stuck out right the team will suffer as they have both just not been performing in those positions this season.

4002~~~
Rooney playing in such a vital position up top and so badly makes little sense IMO. Herrera with Martial infront of him and Mata on the right is the way to go. Wont happen though. Wayne is king at OT.

4003~~~
Exactly which is why up top at least i think he would cause less damage to our build up play. And might even score a few goals to boost his confidence.

Mata on the right is absolutely not the way to go. We need width and pace out there to stretch teams and Mata provides neither but Martial can. Plus Mata looked better in the middle yesterday than out wide.

4004~~~
The difficult times the club is going through is gonna make him a stronger player mentally. He already has so much responsibility.

4005~~~
Fixed.

4006~~~
Love this guy.

4007~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4008~~~
Maybe but if he must be on the pitch then it definitely shouldn't be on the right wing.

4009~~~
1 thing I think him playing on the right showed the most is how nice it was to finally have pace on both wings. He made so many great dribbles through their midfield that ended with a poor Rooney pass or final touch. 

We desperately need another right winger with pace, so that Martial can get back up top. Him being the only fast dribbler in the team isn't helpful at all.

4010~~~
This. We absolutely need to have pace on both wings.

4011~~~
It's something we ALWAYS had under fergie through the years minus Beckham, but obviously he brought a very different skillset. We could still play 433 with fast hard working wingers, or change and go 442 and still keep that pace. That is 1 part we have somehow lost in the fight to gain possession, as many would say speed kills. 

It's mainly why Leicester are doing so well, they have the average fastest squad in the league, and stangely enough they are walking it.

4012~~~
He looked frustrated by the (non) service from his teammates against Norwich.

4013~~~
Sometimes he reminds me of a CAM.  The way he has the ability to dribble & his close control; i feel like being right up against the defensive line is detrimental to his skills. 

Either way our attack lacks a focal point.  IMO all memphis,  martial, lingard/ new RW should be playing off a central focus point (basically in front of the defence rather than up against it)

4014~~~
Was at the game on Saturday and it was appalling watching him shunted out to the right while Rooney was stinking it up at #9.

It seems to me that teams find it much easier to smother him when he's on the wing as well. He'd be much more dangerous in the middle.

4015~~~
Was watching asky last night and Henry was making a big deal of him being on the right saying it was a total waste and I tend to agree. They showed a touch map and almost all of his touches were right out on the touchline and he wasnt getting involved enough close to the box. 

A player like Martial has to be playing as a striker, OK maybe late in a game chuck him out wide if were desperate but players ding score from the touchline. Martial has shown he is a goalscorer let's just hone his goal scoring skills as his finishing is not the complete article just yet.

4016~~~
I'm not one of those calling for LVG lo leave before the Stoke game, but if this is how he intends to use him, then he needs to be fecked off asap.

4017~~~
Yes, and Mourinho will come in to loan him out and eventually sell him like he did Lukaku

4018~~~
board would never let him do it. Woody is a personal fan of martial, scouted him and everything.

4019~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Im sure he did

4020~~~
At this point, I think it's pretty clear that it won't work and isn't worth a try.

4021~~~
I doubt that would happen.

4022~~~
Tell me please how many games have we played this season with Rooney up top and Mata in behind. And of those games how many have been in a row?

4023~~~
Him getting a run on the right is such a shit idea, how about we just play him as a striker.

Mata's shit as a number ten and Rooney's shit as a number nine, Rooney has no chance of playing his way back into form, he's completely done, mate.

4024~~~
Mata at number 10 can only be as good as the three static goofs put in front of him. If they don't move then he's got nothing to hit.

4025~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/wi6a" width="560"></iframe>
Excellent analysis on LVG and clues to why our attackers have been shite under him. If he can't see this is a problem, then there is nothing anyone can do to help him.

4026~~~
You're fighting a losing battle trying to argue our players aren't shit at the minute.

4027~~~
Lets be honest here Martial isn't exactly pulling up trees either up front. Yes he's young and in a team that isn't playing well. But he's being played too much and has too much pressure on him right now. Moving him out wide will relieve some of that pressure.

Mata isn't shit at 10 jesus he was Chelsea's player of the year 2 years in a row and one of the best players in the league. We play him mostly on the right and his form goes to shit, coincidence i think not.

Rooney may well be done but it seems like Van Gaal is going to keep playing him, so i would prefer him up front as opposed to in behind where his bad form will have a more negative affect on the team.

4028~~~
My point is, its ridiculous to pick out Mata when the rest of our front 4 (including Martial) are too static.

4029~~~
Oh I quite agree with you, but we're in full crisis mode and it seems everyones decided that absolutely everyone is shit for the time being.

4030~~~
That touch-map is just ridiculous. Has LVG mistaken Martial for Valencia? Baffling tactics.

4031~~~
It's quite frankly blizzare and if the rest of the sack can't force him to change, then, we need to decide asap.

4032~~~
We had a problem on the RW from the start of the season. Soon as shaw was injured; the left hand side got just as bad.  Everything currently has to go through the centre & unfortunately martial is still a little too young to build the whole team around; even though that is the long term plan.

4033~~~
Kind of off topic and i mostly agree but he goes missing at times and its just less detrimental when hes out on the wing.
I'd still play lingard on the right though, or young.

Martial looks great at #9 to me, i'd leave him there, its one of the few parts of our attack that looks functional.
Its the 3 behind that are the issue for me.

4034~~~
Good analysis by Henry on Martial. It is good to know we are ruining a potential top class attacker in Martial for future reference. It is embarrassing how we are utilizing him as a static winger. Before we had him, we complained about not having a striker that run in behind, pull defenders and can score goals. When he first arrived, he did all of that when we played him centrally. Now we have resorted to giving him a more strict approach that has clearly ruined his game. It was a jest before when I taught we will ruin Martial after seeing what we did with Di Maria; now it does not appear to be to funny considering we are possibly hindering a potential top class player's development.

4035~~~
He has 7 goals in 20 appearances. He has probably played wide a few times too. He has adapted as well as any teenager moving to a new league in a struggling team.

What pressure exactly is on Martial? No one is moaning when he has a shit game or misses chances. Everyone thinks he is good now and will get better so we are willing to wait.

4036~~~
Posted in the mnf thread, probably useful here.

4037~~~
Thing about Smalling in attack is top example. 

Attackers who know their instructions are static, and defender who is lost in attack has better movement than them. It's quite sad actually what are attackers are instructed to do, or actually not to do. We are complaining about teams that park the bus and saying we lack quality to break it and our manager is instructioning our forwards to just keep their positions. Great stuff.

4038~~~
Where did i say he wasn't adapting well?

Of course he's under pressure, most of our fans are looking to him to carry the team right now and i'm sure he aware of that. Because of other factors like senior players being woefully out of form and the squad being thin. He is having to take on more responsibility than he ideally should have to at his age.

And i could be wrong but it also looks to me like he is putting himself under pressure to perform and carry the team because of all the injuries and players in poor form.

Even at that at his age i don't think he should be playing every game, could lead to him burning out and slowing his development.

4039~~~
Great clip, it just shows how out of touch from modern football LVG truly is. Carragher explained things very well and Henry was spot on regarding Martial. 
Martial was never asked to play as a "hug the touchline" winger before in his career, another incredibly stupid decision by the manager. The more you think about it and the more you realize half the team's problems are self inflicted.

4040~~~
Do you think Rooney will suddenly roll back the years and start banging them away and leading the line because he's got Mata behind him? My opinion is that he won't, so it won't matter who's behind him.

4041~~~
This is Mourinho we're talking about. Mata will be as good as gone too

4042~~~
Anthony martial will become twice the player having games on his weakest side.  

If he becomes as capable on the right as he is on the left; we will have a central striker who can rotate around 2 wingers who cut inside. 

Playing an aging wayne rooney on the right does nothing for martial's long term ability; neither for wayne rooney's short term abilities.

4043~~~
Rooney's the best crosser in the squad. He'd be a good choice on the right, imo.

4044~~~
Maybe not but we won't actually know if it would work until we actually you know try it out for a few games in a row.

I doubt we have set up that way for more than 2-4 games this season. And certainly not 2 in a row.

Van Gaal will always play Rooney when fit thats a fact we can't get around, in his current form he is less of a hindrance to the team up front than he is in behind where all our play runs through him.

4045~~~
what's this based on exactly? Cant remember the last time he was out wide whipping a pearler in

4046~~~
He's not allowed to drift out wide under van Gaal. His crossfield passing technique certainly hasn't abandoned him, though. They're essentially the same methods of striking the ball.

4047~~~
his 60 yard golf shots to the right wing are nothing like a cross into the box

4048~~~
He's done them loads over the years.

4049~~~
Am I imagining things or is Rojo the best crosser we have? He hits them with purpose and precision more often than not. Blind is also good at picking out a man from out wide.

4050~~~
Rojo does seem like a good crosser of the ball but I'm not sure we've seen enough of him consistently at LB to really assess. 

Shaw is probably the best but he's obviously out.

4051~~~
Well Mata going might no be the worst thing. Martial is our best attacking player though. I can't see Mourinho dropping him.

4052~~~
Really? Don't think Shaw's shown consistently excellent delivery from wider areas. I've always felt he whips it low or cuts back a lot more often/better than he floats them.

4053~~~
Shaw's crossing is seriously suspect. Blind is the best of the lot.

4054~~~
Rooney got credited with an assist for that <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4055~~~
Ffs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4056~~~
The only reason we cross the ball is because fellaini is playing. There is not a single player otherwise that crossing is worth while for. 

The reason young doesnt start out wide is because that's not the football we play.  We dont have that predatory striker who heads in crosses so why people are talking about crossing is beyond me. Its not like you see neymar crossing the ball for a messi diving header every game. 

You are starting to see attackers on the floor; a type of play much more constant than closing your eyes and crossing.  This bad period is a growth period & players like martial will have to learn and play on their weakspots (RW)  to dominate.  

Rooney is no long term thing here; a mere stop gap until the right individual joins the right position.

4057~~~
It really is similar to Evra's at times. Low and hard without much precision, the crazy thing is that I've seen Evra deliver some beautiful crosses at Juventus.

4058~~~
I worry that we're going to waste this guy.

4059~~~
Naah, LVG is a goner.

4060~~~
Did you get that curry recipe? My wife is nagging me about making it.

4061~~~
Tonight for sure.

4062~~~
You're a star, sir.

4063~~~
Click on a thread about football player. Get prattle avout curry recipes. Wtf is this shit <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4064~~~
I would suggest Young is the best crosser we have in the squad.

In my opinion we should be looking to play Young on either the right or left, drop Rooney and play Martial up top with either Mata or Herrera in behind

4065~~~
He put in a couple the other day that Hernandez would have lapped up, but there was nobody there.

4066~~~
We don't really have anyone with that predatory instinct like Hernandez, RVN or OGS were like in the past. Martial is a great prospect but isn't the same kind of striker at all and Rooney just seems disinterested unfortunately

4067~~~
Young never seem to find anyone with his crosses. LvG should never have let Januzaj go out on loan. I think he is a much better crosser and has goals in him.

4068~~~
Pfft that could be true for Young literally every game he plays. He has a complete inability to find a man when crossing the ball. He might have nice shape on it, but he's a dreadful crosser.

4069~~~
He is awful crosser from the left, IMO. I can't remember few goals we scored after his cross. He has good cross from the right but he hardly plays there.

4070~~~
All depends on him and Herrera today.

4071~~~
he really is awful but what is frustrating, every one of us knows where his cross is going to go, every defender knows but only our players dont have a clue where the ball is going.....

4072~~~
Back post. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4073~~~
He hasn't played that well either.

4074~~~
Still the only player willing to take his man on and succeeds more than the likes of Memphis and Mata.

4075~~~
Depressing how much experienced forward players around him could have helped him today.

4076~~~
He's let his head drop. Big fan of his even when he's played below par but today he was just plain bad and too selfish/naive/lazy call it whatever it you want.

Constantly dribbled into troubled (which before he would get somewhere with but the majority of the time today just got sniffed out), lost 'chances' to take a shot/put a ball in earlier by being far too slow decision making wise and worst of all today put in lazy crosses as a last resort that never cleared the first defender simply because it was the easier way to get rid of the ball.

I'm only harsh but he's the only thing I believe in at Utd atm but I know he's young and deserves more patience.

4077~~~
Ran into dead ends much too often but made himself a chance in the 2nd half, marginally less crap than the rest.

4078~~~
Yeah, he's been really poor recently too.

4079~~~
Really needs to improve his off the ball movement - he always seems to get the ball in a stationary position and then he will just get doubled up on. He made 1 good run inside when Johnson was ball watching - why doesn't he do that more often!!

4080~~~
AJ is a million miles of the standard united need just now as is Wilson. What we need is 3-4 full internationals coming in to the starting 11 around the age of 23-28!

4081~~~
He's basically dribbling himself into the ground. He knows he's gotta do it himself.

4082~~~
I do agree btw.

4083~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/fiyn" width="560"></iframe>

Embarassing.

4084~~~
That was stupid. Sometimes players fall without looking for FKs but this was a clear dive.

4085~~~
Ugh...our environment is toxic. We need Pochettino or a more capable manager.

4086~~~
While that was bad he was completely isolated, no wonder he feels like he has to cheat to get anything done.

Shame he didnt score when he went for the far post, it was a lovely spin and a great little drag passed the defender. He has those moments of magic when he drops off and is so good at shielding the ball against defenders.

I hope our new manager gets a proper 442 going so that he has a striker partner to dovetail, he will become even better with another forward close supporting him IMO.

4087~~~
He's so, so good. Would love a goal tonight.

4088~~~
He is playing better tonight. He needs to work on his striking of the ball.

4089~~~
His dribbling is ridiculous, so many times he's running at two or three people closed off, but somehow comes out the other end with the ball, unless he's chucked over.

4090~~~
Needs to quit diving/falling over.

4091~~~
He doesn't dive, he just gets fouled a lot, but I agree that he has to keep his balance.

4092~~~
He's so much more effective coming from out on that wing. As long as it's a left forward rather than a left winger who is asked to run up and down the line, I think that's his position.

4093~~~
He does, that penalty shout today was a blatant dive. Dived one or two times vs Stoke as well.

4094~~~
His delivery isn't good enough for a top winger. We need to get him a proper position.

4095~~~
The shining light of LVG's tenure.

Our best outfield player at the age of 19. Just incredible.

4096~~~
He was very good again. Fantastic player but needs others around to support him. Should have got MOTM ahead of Rooney

He was our best outlet and had Ivanovic on toast, so LvG moved him to the right and brought Memphis on........

4099~~~
Tactical genius.

4100~~~
I reckon he'd love to play with somebody like Kagawa.

4101~~~
Actually think he's better on the left-wing. Tore Ivanovic apart, just imagine we had a similar outlet on the right wing and a proper striker.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/5row" width="560"></iframe>

4102~~~
Because he is not a winger. He is a Goal scoring forward playing wide.

4103~~~
Commentator is over excited there. TC knew nothing of that save, the ball hit him rather than him making a save.

4104~~~
He's absolutely mint, but he wont be here for long if he keeps us these performances and we continue to stagnate.

Barca/Madrid/Bayern et el will be all over him within a season or two.

Future BPITW material.

4105~~~
Was MOTM for me, only just better than Rooney <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

4106~~~
Brilliant today we need to build around him like henry said, class player.

4107~~~
Holy shit..  That guy is exciting.. That cant be said about many others in that squad..

4108~~~
Gameplan should have been to isolate Ivanovic and have Martial run at him all game.

4109~~~
Not condoning it but, it's also crazy how many non-calls he is getting right now that can see him maybe look for it at times. Poor guy ends up on the ground looking frustrated so often and it doesn't seem like our management is doing anything to get protection from the refs. I know there are players that have the mentality to just pick themselves and keep going even after getting repeatedly targeted and Martial might turn out to be that way but, still would like to get both the management and our senior players starting to look after him better on the field.

4110~~~
You can see how much more frustrated he seems to be on the pitch in comparison to when he arrived. Bad results and bad football have affected him a lot. Just hoping he won't dive anymore so that when he gets genuinely fouled, referees won't think he's cheating.

4111~~~
I didn't think the move to switch Memphis in for him on the left was that bad a decision. He was having a harder time as the 2nd half went and Zouma was dropping back to help Ivanovic more. Sending him over to the right was the bad call. Would have kept him central, force Chelsea to get tighter in the center with both Martial and Rooney in there. Gives more space for Memphis to work with, plus I wonder if Martial would have done better at the end of that Borthwick cross.

4112~~~
Definitely better coming in off the left than playing up top at the minute imo.

4113~~~
It feels like in recent times on the wing he has been playing really deep, at points I couldn't even see him on the TV when the camera was focused on the opposition third, he was more like a left midfielder in nowhere land. Whereas last game and some games earlier in the season he seemed to play much more like a left forward, was lovely to see him going at the opponents. Hard to believe he's only 20 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4114~~~
1 in 3 is a decent return from him in his debut season so far, especially when you consider the restrictions on our attacking play and the lack of service. Aged 19/20 and in a new league, I think he's done ok. Playing on the wing hasn't helped either, but this guy is going to thrive once we work out how to attack without leaving gaping holes.

4115~~~
He must have been shocked to see the technique of the superstars we have like Rooney. Probably seen much better at Monaco and in the Lyon youth academy. 

Basically he is our best and most likely player to force a breakthrough. He wasn't expecting this shit when he joined United.

4116~~~
"He's done ok" is an understatement, the kid has been head and shoulders above the rest of the squad. He made Coleman and Ricardo Rodriguez look like average fullbacks.

4117~~~
Pretty much. I meant more in terms of goal output, but it's clear to see that even at 20 he's a cut above the rest of our attackers.

4118~~~
He's our player of the season as far as I'm concerned.

4119~~~
One issue I have with him playing out wide is that he has the propensity to stand still, seeking to receive the ball from deep and dribble forwards. Thats nice, and can sometimes work because his dribbling ability is fantastic, but he should look to make inside runs more with his pace. Sort of like how Walcott would do playing out on the right.

4120~~~
His best position is on the left at the moment in my opinion. We need to keep him there for a run of games and get some consistency in attack. Changing positions every game is not helping him or the team.

4121~~~
He's had a terrific season so far for a 19/20 year old especially considering just how poor an attack he's part of.

4122~~~
Our problem is, we seriously lack players making runs into and around the box. When he got the ball against Chelsea he had to do it all himself. If Herrera made a few last minute runs into the box, along with a few other players who could drag defenders away, he'd have much more joy cutting in and either scoring, or making an assist.

4123~~~
I still think hes a striker, not a winger, i dont want him becoming the next Welbeck, he needs to learn his position, not get shunted for players who may earn more but clearly arent at his level..

4124~~~
Confident he'll be among the best players in the world at 22/23.

4125~~~
He is a striker, it is just that our attacking options are that fecking bad that him as a winger is better than the actual wingers that we have. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

4126~~~
He is wasted as a striker at the minute as he gets no service. At least with him on the wing whoever is upfront or attacking the box will get chances. He could and almost did score and create one on Monday.

4127~~~
He'll be ok as long as his instructions are clear! Changing positions between CF and LW won't harm him as he plays on the left for the national side.

What will harm his development is different instructions every week and a different manager every 12 months...consistency is what he needs.

4128~~~
He's already better than Welbeck ever was, but I'm guessing you mean you don't want him not to know his best position?

4129~~~
We need two of him. One on the wing and one at number 9. He's insurmountably our best player in both positions.

Imagine Martial launching in from the left with the ball, dropping the shoulders and serving up full backs on toast, then fizzing it across goal to Martial. Phwoar.

4130~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> The state of us. Our best striker is also our best winger and has only been here a few months and also one of the youngest players in the squad. Unbelievable.

4131~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4132~~~
On the flipside, in a glass-half-full scenario, it's also a testament to just how stupidly good he is <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4133~~~
Done well in the big games as well. 

Scored <i>that </i>goal against Liverpool.

Best attacker on the pitch vs City.

Best attacker on the pitch vs Chelsea.

Got the opening goal in our "biggest game of the season" vs Wolfsburg.

4134~~~
Also think he is far more effective on the wings than through the middle right now but, then again he is also better than Rooney through the middle at the moment. Problem becomes when he is played through the middle we have no one on the outside right now that can attack defenses and it leaves him with little service. The thing though is that he needs to be playing with a bit more freedom in terms of his positioning. When he is right or left sided player, he actually plays as a winger, sticking too much to his sideline. Against I Chelsea, there was a point where we had the ball down the left and there were like 5 of United down there and Martial just stood on the touchline where as he could have made the run behind or into the middle. We need to change his wide role to be more of a wide forward, to someone that is free to come in whenever he sees the space or swap with the striker, we'll get a lot more out of him.

In January if we can get a striker that is willing to play off the shoulder of defenses, not constantly coming short, leaving us no one to play the ball into the box to, to keep the central defenders occupied, then I don't think people will mind as much him playing a wide forward role because he'll have more freedom rather than getting stuck as 9 who doesn't see the ball that much for him to be truly effective.

4135~~~
I like to think of him as our Premier League moulded version of Neymar on the left. Fast, a hard bastard and incredible dribbling ability. It's the two positions next to him that we really need to sort out.

4136~~~
Welbeck was a bad example, I want to keep him centrally so he can work on his shooting and close control, learn thr positions to take up.. Being wide forces you to look up and look for the middle man usually, when you dont counter well as we set up for possesion, i just think we are limiting his gosl action and it's crazy as he is the best we have at the moment it would seem

4137~~~
By far, but he's also our most dangerous and creative winger, which is even crazier in my opinion. 
Of the two, it's probably easier to find a quick, creative young winger in the market than a CF as complete as he is. Hopefully we help him out by bringing one of the former in.

4138~~~
On the left he sees more of the ball and makes more penetrative runs than any other player we have. Let him build up some sort of understanding with Rooney up front and Herrera behind and we at least might start creating some chances, for all 3 of them.

4139~~~
At the moment he's better on the left even if in the future there is little about him being our main striker.

4140~~~
I keep changing my mind about his best position, but with his dribbling skills and pace i feel he is best used out wide.

4141~~~
He is less likely to get doubled up on when he is on the left than when he is playing in the middle, especially as our style of play means teams sit in compact banks of four. 

At the minute, we need to focus on getting him one on one against defenders as that is when he is at his most deadly. It only makes sense to play him on the left at the minute.

4142~~~
The first order of business has to be to buy a good pacy wide player to enable us to play martial up top.

4143~~~
I'm assuming I'm in the minority in thinking Martial is better off coming from the wing at the moment. People blaming Rooney for pushing him out wide, but I actually think it's better this way. Of course, it would be a lot better if we had a decent striker to replace Rooney in the middle.

Martial just makes so much more space for himself coming from the wing. We create a lot more chances, for the team and for Martial himself. 

Then again, if we had a competent winger then maybe it would be different and this would result in Martial actually performing better in the middle and actually scoring more from the threat coming from someone else on the wing. Alas we are unable to do that with this current squad/Memphis' current form.

Hopefully he'll get into a purple patch soon.

4144~~~
People saying Martial is best suited to the wing seem to have forgotten what he offers through the middle. Remember the hold ups battling with defenders twice as big, the little one twos putting others through, the quick feet inside the box creating space/chance by himself.
The fact that he can be effective in the wings should be his asset as a striker who likes to roam and find/make spaces for himself/teammates, not the other way around.
Strikers of his quality are few and almost all are unattainable. But a tricky pacy wide-man like him are many and easily attainable. For this season,due to the incompetence of Rooney, Memphis and LVG, he has to be sacrificed to the wings but come next season let our no.9 be the no.9.

4145~~~
As long as we're forced to endure Rooney in the starting XI, the only way to go is to have Martial left and Rooney central in a 433.  But as soon as LVG understands the extent to which Rooney is a liability and eventually drops him, Martial can go back to his best position.

4146~~~
His position is a real problem this season. We need him out wide because he's the only one that can beat a man and terrorize defenders. We need him in the middle because he's miles better than Rooney. I'd try Memphis as a striker for a few games.

4147~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/efws" width="560"></iframe>

4148~~~
Maybe the fat scouser can learn how to finish off this young lad. 

Downright dumb he's not playing as the main striker in the middle.

4149~~~
And some are still disgruntled with him. What more can you expect from a 20 year old in his first season in a new league with utter shit surrounding him.

4150~~~
Under normal circumstances I'd prefer him on the left, but really, everyone else is shite and he should probably be up front.

4151~~~
I want to see him play as a center forward.

4152~~~
Would force a move if I was him.

4153~~~
Amazing talent

4154~~~
Our attacks start with his movement and finish with him doing something superb to score directly or indirectly. Thank God for Anthony Martial.

4155~~~
Scroll through the last ten pages and you will see some saying he hasn't done that well. Absolutely shocking posts.

4156~~~
The first half today was average, the second half was world class.

4157~~~
He's already a brilliant player, it'll be very interesting to see just how good he can become

4158~~~
Pointless assessment of his match aside, I was talking about Martial's time here so far. How could one ask more of someone who has turned 20 coming from a foreign league with useless veterans guiding him during his time here?

4159~~~
#Bargain

4160~~~
He's absolutely sublime. Never would have thought he'd have such an impact at United.

4161~~~
This kid is the Man Utd attack at the minute. That Golden Boy award cannot be questioned.

4162~~~
I thought he was overrunning some of his dribbles in the first half and his touch was off but then he scores the equaliser and sets up the winner. What a talent we have here, fantastic player.

4163~~~
His overall time here has been brilliant. What makes you think our veterans are useless in terms of leadership? Just because some are not playing well on the pitch? Fact is, you can't know anything about their leadership unless you're on the inside of the team.

It's obvious Martial has been one of our best players this season and is a huge talent, that doesn't mean he's free of criticism though. And in today's first half he wasn't half as active as in the second. Even prior to the goal he was looking to make things happen, he was moving much more off the ball, he was active with the ball and doing just what we need from him.

4164~~~
Great, great players. I can only hope we will add enough quality to the team to give him enough incentives to stay here for a long, long time and not jump ship the second Real or Barca come calling.

4165~~~
It's just incredible the way he glides past defenders. That's the most striking similarity to Thierry Henry.

4166~~~
He's a monster already and still raw as hell. I'm so looking forward to see his development

4167~~~
He's special. Where would we be now without him?

4168~~~
Love him. His league goals from last season that I posted in another thread:

That goal of his today reminds me of some of them & hopefully we can get someone to provide him the service to score even more

4169~~~
Absolute genius.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4170~~~
This should settle the debate about his best position.

Very interesting. Did you do it by judging from where he made the run and scored from or did you go as far as checking the starting lineups for all those matches ? Great effort anyway.

4171~~~
If he can improve his touch a bit I genuinely feel we have a once in a generation good player, the way he created the Rooney goal was insane.

4172~~~
We would be totally fecked without him, our only attacking threat.

4173~~~
Agreed.

4174~~~
Class today, one or two raw moments for sure but he's just such a threat and you can't ask much more than getting a goal and making the winner.

4175~~~
Yep. He's class up front, but he gets too isolated when we put him there at times and our players behind the striker can't really do anything so he doesn't get many chances or time on the ball to run at the defence. On the wing, he's a constant threat and creates chances consistently which no other United winger can do at the moment, and he can also come in and score goals. He's our best player basically, so you put him where he'll get on the ball the most. For now, that's out wide.

4176~~~
I wouldn't go that far just yet, he's still got a lot of developing to do and could turn out to be an absolutely fantastic number 9 I think. The main problem with him being up front has been our team not being able to give him the service. Right now it's been good to have him on the wing as he can take people on and make things happen though.

4177~~~
Where would we be without this guy? He's the only player in the squad you could say is at our level. Got a few more if them in, please.

4178~~~
That's the most important thing for me about this. He doesn't lose his danger factor and he can be creative, there is a lot to win for the team by playing him there at the moment.

4179~~~
Anthony Master.

4180~~~
I just meant that at the moment there is no doubt he is better playing there. Once his finishing improves and experience, there is a top class striker waiting to emerge.

4181~~~
He basically forces the 4-3-3 formation, he's so good from the left but not exactly a winger. I love it. 
Get the 2 other attacking players this summer and he'll double his numbers.

4182~~~
I can't wait for us to offload Rooney and build our team around him. Still raw in some places but who cares, he's only 20 in a new league. A bright future ahead.

4183~~~
Fixed.

4184~~~
Some day very soon he's going to go into full beast mode. You can really feel it coming

4185~~~
I think I prefer him out wide. In LVG's system at least. It gets him on the ball much more than he does as a #9. He just seems to breeze past full backs when played as a winger and creates plenty of chances.

4186~~~
I think so too. With better players around him I'd want him more as a #9 but we don't have that at the moment. So I want him to be the one creating the goals.

4187~~~
Agreed.

4188~~~
Kid is pure class, best young player in the world right now and currently the reason I watch Manchester United.

4189~~~
Very good performance, scored a goal and assisted the other. I hope we find attacking players who can bring the best out of him

4190~~~
Yeah. Once our other wingers are a bit better then the likes of Memphis (right now), Lingard, Mata (providing no threat out wide), or Young with his inconsistency, then he should go back up top. But as it is, he's the only winger who can be a consistent threat with his dribbling and pace out wide.

4191~~~
Great header, couldn't believe he managed to get so much power on it, I was sure it hit someone on the foot first.

4192~~~
Excellent performance from him today, he's so quick and direct. The antithesis of Rooney, basically.

4193~~~
Brilliant today, I just worry that eventually he will get fed up of carrying this side. Let's enjoy him while we can.

4194~~~
He works out wide when its wide of a front three. He doesnt work when hes put on the wing and told to stay there (cos then he doesnt really get into the box).

If we can get an equivalent of him for the right, (and a top class striker) it will take off pressure of him, allow him to be rested as well. Given hes only 20 hes having a strong season, but again, we need to be careful not to burn him out.

4195~~~
Waste of money etc etc

4196~~~
nine..teen!

4197~~~
He is capable of having a Ronaldo level of impact for us if he's nurtured correctly and given time.

4198~~~
Absolutely right. I'm still not sure how he got that much power into it.

4199~~~
What a talent he is. Exceptional.

4200~~~
Played at wing back for portions of today's game. You could see at the game that he was basically matching youngs line across the pitch.

4201~~~
Oh and yeah, he's class. He's the only thing keeping us entertaining at all. We'd be fecked without him.

4202~~~
Depay should study Martial who is younger than him, more mature and better than him.

4203~~~
Yup I'm with you there, he's clearly going to be a striker but is so effective on the left for us. His assist for Rooney's goal was brilliant he just ran past the full back with ease.

4204~~~
Not comparing but he's capable of that move that messi does where he uses other players to play 1-2's to him to enabling him to dart at goal. Not many players can do that but martial's combination of ability,  pace and strength that allow him to. He has to work on what he does when he gets the return though. He loses gas sometimes in those moves.

4205~~~
His instantaneous change of pace to beat players in tight situations is incredible.

4206~~~
Thought of Messi as well today when I saw him go past players. So quick for the first few meters with close control and he times it so well. Defenders really have to time it perfectly to stop him.

4207~~~
I know right. His pace from a standing position is great too, Depay needs to learn from this kid.

4208~~~
He is going to be one heck of a player in 3 years time.  Sadly thats when we'll have to sell him to Barcelona <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4209~~~
Heading was supposed to be the one thing he wasn't good at, as well. That's two great headers he's scored for us, doesn't look too bad at them to me

4210~~~
Mix of both. Looked on transfermarkt for where they attributed him as playing from then looked at where he made the runs and scored from. I think there was just one that didn't match with transfermarkt saying he started on wing but he was central at the time.

4211~~~
I don't agree with those that say he should be playing as a 9, should be used like Neymar off the left, but also needs to be given the freedom to roam and swap positions. You want him in the box more often, but not having to play with his back to goal top much as you nullify his threat then.

4212~~~
if he picks up an injury we are fecked. He is so far ahead of anyone else its unreal, we need him to create and finish

4213~~~
He reminds me a lot of Henry, a striker who is adept at going down the left, coming in and scoring.

4214~~~
He was never bad at them, he just never tried one.

4215~~~
Yep. It was that and his shooting from range since he never tried either. His shooting overall I don't think is that great, or definitely can be improved on, so that's one thing at least that you can point out as a weakness.

4216~~~
I see. Thanks for your effort, very informative. At the moment I want to see mostly on the left then as a striker and really if there are no other possibilities on the right.

4217~~~
When I see how he improved his dribbling, I can only dream about how he can improve his shooting.<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4218~~~
Better than Henry and Ronaldo at the same age. Quite a player. My only concern is we are playing him all the time at 20 because no one else is on his level. Possibly the only good of getting knocked out of the champions league is that he won't have to play so much

4219~~~
He is absolutely brilliant.

4220~~~
Actually I think it'd be most kids dreams of being able to carry a team like United, gives him a great chance of being a main member of the Euros squad for France.

4221~~~
Gonna have to start blocking the people who spout the shite about him being off to Madrid/Barca.

4222~~~
He can study but he'll never have martial natural gifts with the ball at feet. He can learn other things from him I guess. But he has had a season as top goalscorer and talisman in his career once.

4223~~~
Probably gets MOTM from most but, not for me. I thought he was absolutely a waste in the first half - either of his own doing or instruction. He just would not move off the sideline even when Rooney vacated it by moving into the channels or came deep and when Young was attacking from his side, Martial would not even be in the picture. In the second half he played more of the wide forward role and a goal and an assist and was actually getting involved in some of the intricate play. 

He is some player but, has so much to learn.

4224~~~
Best player at the club. If we hadn't signed him we'd be in big trouble.

Just a goal and an assist, pretty shit really.

4225~~~
Wow, just wow.

4226~~~
What's so wow about it? He played a lot better in the second half but, for me Young was was MOTM for me.

4227~~~
He was better in the 2nd half, which coincided with him not playing at wing back anymore. Playing our best centre forward as a wing back was mental.

4228~~~
Think you've got echo turned on mate.

4229~~~
I said it a few weeks ago, everything he beats his man and comes into the box, his passes to set up a team mate are always pinpoint, usually the players just cant finish, an exceptional player

Also I liked his one- two passing with mata in the final third, some great moves the 2 pulled off, that looked amazing

4230~~~
Somehow this kid made the ridiculous sum of money we payed for him look like a bargain. Amazing. No doubt the best young player in the world.

4231~~~
Martial is a difficult player to rate. Compared to most players his performances are fantastic. But he just looks so ridiculously talented it's hard not to get impatient and start expecting him to be Thierry Henry or Ronaldo9 straight away. Do we judge him on what we'd expect from a 20 year old centre forward in his first season at the club or on what he's capable of?

Somehow we just need to stay patient. It's difficult though when a young player is verging on genius

4232~~~

4233~~~
Next season get better players around him and he'll be even closer to Henry.

Indisputable talent.

4234~~~
Definitely prefer him on the wing much more room to work in and cause the opposition problems.

A year or two out there and he'll be ready to play up top on his own.

4235~~~
He is effective in the middle or the wing, it's a shame we don't have Shaw bombing down the wing doing overlapping runs for him.

4236~~~
He's so naturally cool on the ball. He's so eager to drive.

He's such an anti-van Gaal player, yet he's relied on as the only source of anything meaningful.

4237~~~
If only we had 3 Martials <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4238~~~
He's bloody brilliant. 

Just imagine if we didn't 'panic buy' 'waste our money' on him. We'd be sitting next to Chelsea.

4239~~~
I think he'll be the best player in the Prem or thereabouts next season if his development continues.

He's just a brilliant player. A shame he's part of a struggling squad. I can't wait to see how he performs in a squad firing on all cylinders.

4240~~~
It's great how nobody mentions the fee anymore. Columnists were queuing up to shoot him down about the fee before he'd even kicked a ball in a red shirt. He's continuously sticking two fingers up to the lazy mouthpieces every week. He's roasting full backs every time, and his goal scoring has been more than reasonable for a first season for a 19yr old playing for a poorly performing side.

4241~~~
Having Shaw back will unleash our left wing. At the minute, Blind, Rojo and Darmian are not quick or attacking enough to provide that much of a threat to take the extra man off the winger.

When we get Shaw back, I think it will give Depay and Martial more space to do their stuff, which could be huge.

4242~~~
Love his positivity. Obviously he can lose the ball cheaply at times but he is so exciting. Great finish and assist. Great buy.

4243~~~
Once he cuts out losing the ball easily he will be frightening. He's ridiculously good for a 20yo.

4244~~~
You read my mind.

4245~~~
If we are keen on winning the EL, he might have to play more than if we would have been in the CL.

4246~~~
He can be a little inconsistent but you can see the sublime quality in his play and composure. He had one touch in the match where he just cushioned the pass and calmly turned with it all in the same motion to move toward the goal. Once it all comes together with some better players around him to open up space he will be absolutely lethal. I don't have any complaints about him at all, even his personality and temperment seem to be top quality.

4247~~~
Noticed that when he joined us. Young, hungry but mature at the same time.

4248~~~
He makes it look so easy.  Of course he's very pacy, but he looks like he's only running at 75%.

Incredible that he was our last buy this summer, almost an afterthought.

4249~~~
Imagine how good he could be with quality service around him. He has to do a lot of it on his own out there at the moment.

4250~~~
We need to get our act together or we will lose him really fast.

4251~~~
Losing Shaw was one of the worst things that could've happened us this year. I'm still not over it.

4252~~~
We really need to get a good quality left winger in the summer and push this guy up top. He's a once in a generation talent that will score bucket load with proper players around him.

4253~~~
We've got him til 2020 so I'm not too worried. 

Were people saying the same about Ronaldo and Rooney in 04-06?

4254~~~
He's a joy to watch.

4255~~~
Glad to say I got this one wrong...thought we had gambled too much on a future potential star when he's already the best option we have to win a game.

4256~~~
He has a young family which is sure to ground him, as opposed to other talents his age who go a bit mental with their money/status. Not heard how his English is progressing; don't think he spoke much when he joined.

4257~~~
As a big fan of those 1-2s Messi loves doing (Neymar too now). It was lovely to see Martial try connect with the other players.

He is probably the only player in the team that plays with such purpose. Lingard too actually, lingard just isnt as talented.

4258~~~
Him and Shaw down the left could be frighteningly good. Shaw's a tank and is going to open all kinds of space up for him, like he was for Memphis. Martial is far more mature as well so he will link up and make good use of Shaw.

4259~~~
Those two are the only players in the club that run at players. I'm not even having a go at the other players cause it isn't their game. We simply haven't bought enough attackers in the last two years.

4260~~~
Although we lost Di Maria we got an upgrade, a younger & cheaper upgrade, as far as I'm concerned.

4261~~~
We'd been scouting him a while, just that Monaco getting knocked out the CL increased the chances of a move from 0 to feasible... and even then parts of the Monaco board were pissed off that he was sold.

4262~~~
Pretty sure his fee including addons is more than what we paid for Di Maria

4263~~~
To be fair, he does have to become the best player in the world for that to happen

4264~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

£59.7m for Di Maria <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2014/Aug/manchester-united-sign-angel-di-maria-from-real-madrid.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...ted-sign-angel-di-maria-from-real-madrid.aspx</a>

£57.6m for Martial (if all the bonuses are triggered) <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-transfers-monaco-reveal-9981162" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...hester-united-transfers-monaco-reveal-9981162</a>

Bet he's on a significantly lower weekly wage also. 

Also, I bet he would be absolutely emotionless if some scallies broke into his house <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4265~~~
No. We paid £59.75m for Di Maria. Maximum we pay for Martial is £58m

4266~~~
Fair enough. Pretty sure its also massively due to the Euro collapsing like a motherfecker in between those two years. I'd know, because I lost a chunk of my deposit when living abroad for the year.

4267~~~
Was he signed on the usual 4 year with an option (United's option) of an extra year?

4268~~~
yep.

4269~~~
Good, I hope he's not an fortune already so we can nail him down again to an improved contract in a year or so.

4270~~~
I'd actually like to see him behind a more focal point of a striker. 

He has this unique ability to start attacks with the ball.  It's hard to explain but he can turn - dribble - pass upon recieving the ball (a very small bit like kaka)  and he does so with urgency.

4271~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4272~~~
The fee's £36m at the moment.

+£7m if he scores 25 goals in his first four seasons here (he probably will)
+£7m if he gets 25 French caps during his first four seasons here (he probably will)
+£7m if he wins the Ballon d'Or in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 or 2019 (he probably won't seeing as he'll still only be 23 and has a long way to go to surpass Neymar or Messi in the next 3 years)

I expect £50m will be his final price. Not really that bad considering it's roughly what City will pay for Sterling. They currently have the same goals/assists for the season, fwiw.

Looking at their respective lifestyles and attitudes, I reckon that £50m will give us a player who's going to stay at the top of world football for longer than Sterling will manage. That's just a feeling, though.

4273~~~
Although it's a different kind of attitude you've got to give it to Sterling for what has happened. At 19 he forced that move to City, had to deal with all the other external things (media pressure, pundits blasting him, being the next great English hope) last year yet whilst still performing at a good level.

Player ability and attributes wise? That's debateable but I think Sterling carries that same determination and professionalism on the field. I.e I don't think he's that type, who will get out of shape and suffer a mental loss of form so to speak. The worry for him will be mostly the same for Martial imo. Over playing, too much pressure and risk of injury because their playing style (and accumulative wear and tear).

4274~~~
^ bang on. The media witchhunt against him led by Scouse pundits was a disgrace.

4275~~~
Feck the fee, all I care about is that he's outrageously talented. Pace, dribbling at pace (doesn't get talked about enough), finishing, strength, hold up play...the guy has everything you want in a striker. Can't wait to see what he'll be in a few years time.

4276~~~
I think having him in front of the defence be thay a false 9 or a CAM/CF will allow him to utilise his drive & skills.  Playing off a predatory striker could be wonderful.

4277~~~
Just been watching some highlights of him. Fast becoming one of my favourite players <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4278~~~
He's worked with Berbatov last season, IIRC <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4279~~~

4280~~~
Good on him and LvG. Louis ows the lad his job.

4281~~~
The more I think about it the more id love to see him paired up with someone like Lukaku. Pace and Power together could be something to behold

presumably Lukaku can speak French so they could communicate well

4282~~~
Oh yes.. this please!

4283~~~
Might just be me but I'm really not a big fan of Lukaku. We need another Martial level talent, Lukaku is tiers below.

4284~~~
I'd prefer Kane that would be a sophisticated attack.

4285~~~
oh I wouldn't grumble at that too

4286~~~
2 seasons I would have agreed with you but I think he's really kicked on, and at only 22 has a huge ceiling.

4287~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> That power.

4288~~~
Are you serious ?

4289~~~
In terms of natural ability, he's correct (well not multiple tiers). Lukaku is a very good striker but Martial given his natural gifts should go on to bigger things IMO. In terms of how naturally things come to them, Martial is a level above. There's a certain class to his game that Lukaku doesn't have.

I'm beginning to feel this way as well.

Lukaku is very explosive, but Kane comes across as more refined and complete.

4290~~~
Just reacted to the "tiers below" expression. As far as I'm concerned, the only real difference in talent between them is how easy Martial can get past his opponents. It is a big difference, Lukaku has other attributes.

4291~~~
Kouroux has appointed himself Chief 'Keep The Caf Grounded on Martial' since we signed him.

4292~~~
Not sure about 'tiers below'.
Martial would do very very well to match Lukaku's scoring record over the next two years. And unless his overall play jumps to a ridiculous level (to compensate for fewer goals), I don't see how he's a tier above.

I'd say lukaku was just as good at 20 years old. The rest is really just down to preference in style, which Martial will win more often than not (and will obviously always win on a United forum).

4293~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VH0CddK-1bw/UMKnDEm8wKI/AAAAAAAAU_Y/PIhPjUbhz6g/s1600/unlimited-power.jpg" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VH0CddK-1bw/UMKnDEm8wKI/AAAAAAAAU_Y/PIhPjUbhz6g/s1600/unlimited-power.jpg"/>

4294~~~
He really has been the start of our attacks.  When it comes to possesion football there is always a player like iniesta even thomas muller who initiates an attack from a deeper position ( an almost similar position to where herrera has been playing).  It's not about passing or shooting -  it's about facing the opposition and pushing the defence back as a team of LW-AM-ST-RW. 

Lukaku is fine but i'd prefer Kane too just because he also has the ability to pick out a pass.  However,  martial is slightly stronger on the left so buying someone like Embolo who is a strong striker with inclinations to roam to the right -  we could have up to 4 attackers during attacks. 

            Embolo
Memphis martial RW

Memphis-martial-Embolo-RW

4295~~~
Availability my friend, availability.

4296~~~
Martial has, for me, the attributes truly special players have whereas Lukaku does not. Of course, he has to develop aspects of his game, but as a raw talent when a player has his strenght, pace and genuine top class talent on the ball, then he's a bit special. Martial has that. Lukaku despite a decent goal-record has never had that. He doesn't have Henry type pick the ball up and frighten defenders or a swerve of the hips to beat a defender in a split second. That separates the good talents from the gems IMO. What Martial makes of that "gem" of a talent he is, is another matter, but so far the signs look very very good.

For example, it doesn't surprise me when fans of the Belgium NT criticize Lukaku. He's very good, but he hasn't got the raw technical skill of an Henry, Suarez type footballer.

4297~~~
football is more about effectiveness rather than that raw ability you speak of especially when it comes to strikers. Batistuta and Shearer for example didnt have that on ball ability you speak of but were both every bit in that Henry/Suarez class because their other qualities more than made up for it. Lukaku is in a similar boat and this season has shown signs that he's well on his way to being a proper big time player. Martial has a frightening amount of ability hence i believe we shouldn't even be considering signing a number 9 but until he learns to be exceptionally effective he'll always have questions on his name. There certainly isnt any tier between them in terms of potential as what Lukaku has is enough to make him the best striker in the world.

4298~~~
This exactly! There are players who have the potential of becoming the next Ronaldo (fat one) or Henry, not to say that they will but you know it is within them, some can never reach that level no matter what. Martial is the former, Lukaku or Kane is the latter. Of course the latter two can go on to have much better careers than Martial ever will. But the point is still that their absolute best would be reaching the levels of someone like Shearer or Andy Cole which is not bad at all at all. Martial is one of those very few who can reach higher, remains to see if he becomes one of those even fewer to actually reach it.

4299~~~
I wasn't speaking about effectiveness but only natural ability. And I see plenty of goals in Martial as well.

And I completely disagree. Pure goalscorers are great, but in the end, they tend to fall slightly short of players who both score and frighten you when they pick up the ball and run. Hence, why as much as I loved Ruud, Henry was better. Or why Suarez, although his peak isn't that long yet, is one of the most dangerous strikers I've ever seen. I probably didn't watch Shearer at his peak, but if his ability on the ball wasn't top class, I don't see how he can compete with the names mentioned at their best. Lukaku can keep developing but he won't be as good as the likes of Henry either unless his ability on the ball drastically improves.

4300~~~
Agreed. RvN vs Henry comparison is very apt.

4301~~~
effectiveness is what makes the cream of the great attackers. If Lukaku puts up 35 goals a season, for consecutive seasons while being showing a degree of BMT then he'll be in any class of any striker during his peak. Shearer during his prime was every bit as good as Henry, he posed a massive threat without all this skill. His ball striking combined with his aggression ensured that for a time he was in the most feared strikers bracket. Why would a Batistuta need all this skill on the ball if hes smashing balls 30 yards away on the half turn. 

Whether Henry was better than RVN or not is another debate by itself however during the time he wasn't considered in another tier to him or Eto'o or Schevchenko.

4302~~~
Player of the month. Was a pretty shit month to be fair <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4303~~~
He has scored a few goals last month though. And has been performing well.

4304~~~
he seems/looks like he's nearly 10 years older than he is. plus he has 1.5 kids, if not a full 2 by now. 

someone get an american republican who had experience chasing down obama's birth certificate to investigate this guy.

4305~~~
i mean this guy is so much further ahead in his life than i am at 33 it's frightening. i am nothing.

4306~~~
I'm not a big fan of just signing people like this because they're the only ones available in January. That's how you end up where Liverpool are.

4307~~~
Now that's a happy face.

4308~~~
looks like something he just made in CDT.

4309~~~
He looks overjoyed.

4310~~~
Of course but if you make a decision to only sign the worlds best players because thats where you feel you belong, you'll end up frustrated when you cant sign anybody because the worlds best players rarely move, and when they do 4 or 5 clubs are in for them.

So when you rule out the very top echelon, you would be extremely extremely lucky to pull of a transfer of someone as talented as lukaku in january, even if he's not one of the worlds top 3/4 strikers.

Ultimately your only really able to get the best in the summer, and even then your not going to be grabbing 2 or 3 pogba/bale type players in one window. For every Martial your gunna need a few schneiderlins and hererra's to improve the squad as and when you can. Not signing ANYONE whose not the top prospects in the world is just as dangerous as signing a few too many Sahko's, because you quite literally wont have any talent in your 25 because the best weren't available.

4311~~~
Hate all this talk of comparing his potential to some of the modern greats. Let the lad actually achieve something first other than a big bucks transfer before he's talked about to such levels.

4312~~~
some things are funnier than others, some are not

In case you really believe what you wrote Lukaku is great talent, just because he isn't as good dribbler as Martial doesn't make him a bad player or lesser talent he's got some beasty attributes which Martial doesn't and he's consistent goalscorer from the early age scored more than 16 goals every season past 4 years and he's 2Ofeckin2. He's already scored 19 this season in 25, half season, I am not sure if this is not enough to justify that he clearly is world class talent or some people still thinks he's below Martial's talent just because they are biased fans, the same people who thought Blind is our Pirlo/Modric and Darmian world class fullback.. 

There are some statistics behind Lukaku other stuff like talent are not quite meassurable. And noone can say Martial can fulfil his potential. Januzaj had an awesome start where he is now..

Also it's pretty pathetic to think of players of Martial's potential and that we can just find them easily and take them to OTif we really think that high of him.

4313~~~
Lukaku is a modern great already? <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

4314~~~
Effectiveness isn't only goals which is the point you're missing.

4315~~~
Did anyone see him when he went up top?

4316~~~
Couldn't watch the match so had to rely on the match thread but he wasn't mentioned once until the 70th min or so. Normally you'd see alot of martial!!! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Posts but he must've been truly anonymous this time.

4317~~~
Didn't have a bad start to the game and kept plugging away, but seemed isolated out on the left. When we moved him central we just pumped balls up to him like he was a 6'5 #9. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

4318~~~

4319~~~
Seems like he was under orders to stay wide left in the first half (until he swapped with Mata for a while). He needs to be allowed to get in the penalty area more as otherwise it is Rooney against 5 defenders.

4320~~~
The sun are disgusting

4321~~~
Not a good game. Just showing his inconsistency though, no big deal.

4322~~~
Guy is incredible. Most promising youngster in a United shirt in a long time. Shame the team around him are shite

4323~~~
He's being wasted on the wings. He's ready to be our main attacking outlet already.

4324~~~
He's better on the wing for now, has more space to run at people and create chances for himself and others. I still don't understand why it's not obvious for many caftards.

4325~~~
Agree the only thing is his finishing but that will come. But what a buy by LVG to be fair and at the time he got ridiculed by the press for a panic buy yet Stirling was more.

4326~~~
I don't like him on the right, but still a decent performance from him. 

We need to get him on the ball more.

4327~~~
Agreed, doesn't seem as effective on the right.

4328~~~
He started brightly and that run to open things up for the chance Herrera laid on for Lingard is why he's our most exciting player. Faded as the game went on though and moving around all the time is not helping him IMO.

4329~~~
Looked exhausted at the end I'm guessing he is in the red zone.

4330~~~
He was quiet at times, but I'll still give him plenty of praise due to his work ethic. He relentlessly works to keep the ball, and always perseveres when dribbling with it. Certain opportunities end up with more threat than they should because of him.

4331~~~
He's not a right winger at all. Don't understand why we didn't play Lingard on the right and Martial off the left when you seen the starting 11

4332~~~
Because our manager is a clown.

4333~~~
Made no sense why he played on the right with lingard left wing. He's brilliant either up front or on the left. Probably closer to competent on the right then anyone bar Young as well though to be fair. But still a big waste of his abilities today. Should only ever play left wing or as a striker. Maybe even as a 10. Not a right winger though.

4334~~~
I never thought his hold-up play could be as good as this, for that reason I don't understand he doesn't play up front more often, he showed he has a great turn and burst of space which would defo make problems to collocini. Rooney looked rather hilarious tryna go past collocini on his left through the middle. Martial would simply go past him and goalkeeper like he showed us before but yeah I undertand we have limited options from the flanks he's good dribbler actually no matter where he plays. He's maybe slightly better from the right as he can cut inside on his stronger foot though, still perfect allrounder we have and can develop into great striker but rooney must play<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> that's for sure and if he doesnt play up front he will drop here and herrera who is twice player rooney is and will sit on the bench. This is sad situation, as Martial suffers from it, he would score three today, newcastle defense was so open and herrera is great if given space and support and can release ball really quickly as he showed today as well whereas rooney is lost there but yeah he took his chances today mostly well so he got himself another 20games in the starting line up :-)

4335~~~
Thought he was pretty anonymous. Surprised he stayed on the pitch over Lingard but that was probably a fitness based decision.

4336~~~
I thought he was excellent yet again.  I don't mind him on the right.. Newcastle looked on the back foot every time he ran at them.

4337~~~
He always beats his man, not every single during a game, but always at least once a game. How rare is that for us to say about a Man Utd player this season.

4338~~~
Beautiful player to watch, the most easy on the eye we have had since Ronaldo. He and Shaw are van Gaal's best signings, immense potential.

4339~~~
It is stupid to waste him on the right <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>. Talk about shackling your best attacker.

4340~~~
Equal fastest man in the PL this season:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.givemesport.com/689455-anthony-martial-equals-this-seasons-premier-league-speed-record?autoplay=on" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.givemesport.com/689455-a...asons-premier-league-speed-record?autoplay=on</a>

4341~~~
He did it to take advantage of Dummet who is plain shite. Martial was poor yesterday.

4342~~~
LVG is a fecking idiot. Wastes our best attacker on the right playing as a winger.

4343~~~
Nah, he has been doing it for the last few games regardless of the LB faced.

4344~~~
<img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

I take you meant on the left wing in your first?

I agree with Rooney looking better i would prefer Martial out wide myself. He's better out there than pretty much all our other options right now.

I do think he might need a rest though. The lad has played nearly every game since he joined.

4345~~~
It's really daft to play him on the right even if he didn't do badly. He looks uncomfortable and uneasy every time I see him play there.

4346~~~
Does anybody get the feeling that this season is doing him more bad than good? He's clearly a huge talent, but because of how shite we are, we've been forced to play him more than he should at any club of our stature. In an ideal world, you'd prefer him to come on here and there with something to prove to the world class players already at the club, but instead he's playing week in week out with dross. He has nothing at all to prove right now and he's being burned out.

4347~~~
Yes indeed. For me it's 1) left wing 2) striker and only if there are no alternatives on the right.

4348~~~
Both he and Rooney are better playing as a front two, with Rooney behind Martial. I think criticism of him on either wing is over the top though, he often looks good there too. I'm happy with him anywhere in the attack to be honest. I do think it's important to keep players like Lingard and Herrera close to him though, to provide the through-balls and one-twos which make him dangerous.

4349~~~
Made some good runs last night, but more often than not Fellaini and Schneiderlin either didn't see him or chose not to pick him out. Would have been interesting to see Carrick playing instead of Fellaini.

4350~~~
Nah, I don't think it's been too bad for him. I don't see what's wrong with playing him a lot; plenty of world class players break into their sides in their late teenage years, and if expect Martial to become a top player then I don't see why it should be any different with him. He's not been playing in a <i>great </i>side as such, but someone like Lukaku is still relatively young and thriving at an Everton club below us in the league, for example. Either way, I think it benefits Martial massively to get plenty of game time and he's getting that. The fact that it's often not in his best position is quite worrying though.

4351~~~
He didn't want martial chasing after their right back who's very attacking. Lingard did the hard work which left martial fresh to be our attacking outlet. Was a smart move IMO.

Unfortunately in the 2nd half we just didn't have enough of the ball and never really got it to him. He does need to learn how to get involved more though when he's suffocated like that

4352~~~
The rb wouldn't have been as attacking if he had Martial to take care of. Manchester United shouldn't play their best attacker out of position in fear of Newcastle United's RB.

4353~~~
lol janmaat wouldn't sit back just because martial is on his side, how many others have sat back and not attacked when he's played left wing.

Anyway he did alright I thought on the right, was unlucky not to score or assist. Obviously he is more natural on the left though

4354~~~
Not sure you understood the meaning of "as attacking".

4355~~~
That's you're opinion but IMO he wouldn't care who was tracking him back, that's just how he plays. He would rather attack than defend. 

Having martial chasing him all game would have been detrimental, where as dummett pretty much stays back.

4356~~~
It's criminal playing him on the right.

But he is so good he could play any forward position and create something.

4357~~~
We need to buy a right winger in January, so Martial can rotate with Rooney in the striker position with Herrera/Mata behind. Or even Rooney behind Martial like this:
With Januzaj, Mata, Young, Lindgard, Pereira, Schweinsteiger as rotation players.

4358~~~
Shifting his position in attack in order to accomodate Rooney is daft and will backfire at some point. Sooner rather than later.

4359~~~

4360~~~
He's scoring on Sunday. I reckon he'll haunt Liverpool for years, as long as he stays with us <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

4361~~~
Or is it more because we need his quality out wide? If we had better wingers, I'm sure he would play up front.

4362~~~
Doesn't feel right seeing him talking and making facial expressions that aren't stoic and in-the-zone<i>. </i>

4363~~~
His goal against Liverpool is still my moment of the season. Surround this kid with more quality and I can see him really owning this league.

4364~~~
He'll be instrumental in the coming years in the proces of rebuilding this club where it should be. The standard of the Premier League.

4365~~~
I like the fact he is being played across the front line. The thing with this desperation amongst fans is causing us to ignore he is just a kid that has to be nurtured into a complete footballer.
We can't keep skipping stages in the education of these lads because the team is in need of results. We all know he'll end up a striker but for now let him learn about other roles so he can anticipate situations better.

4366~~~
The fact that he's played across the front line shows how well-rounded he is and his sheer ability is frightening. He has shown instincts on the left, right, through the middle, in the box, etc. I yearn for the days when there was fluidity and uncertainty in the attack, however Martial is a great foundation. If Memphis can continue to mature and have a directness/urgency in his play, we could enjoy watching a proper 9 and a proper 7. If Januzaj knuckles down, then we'll truly have something. Until then, we'll have to make due with what is currently on tap.

4367~~~
Which club do you support? If you don't mind me asking.

4368~~~
Correct he doesn't need to play up front regularly yet, playing out wide will benefit his all round game later in his career.

4369~~~
Haha.. United.

4370~~~

4371~~~
In a match where you are playing on the counter he'd be 10 times more useful playing on the last man, being wasted in this match on the left

4372~~~
Good defending against Firminho there

4373~~~
Might develop into a great player.. but offering less than Welbeck used to on the left wing.

4374~~~
He definitely is. He's faster, stronger and a better dribbler than Welbeck. He has shown he can actually finish too. Should definitely be played up top though.

He's our only good attacking player.

4375~~~
Precisely. Drop Rooney into the #10/take him off and play Martial uptop alone. Sakho and Kolo will shit their pants if he's allowed to run at them.

4376~~~
We should never have sold Danny.

4377~~~
The run that ended with Sakho blocking his shot was decent. Otherwise he's working off scraps, but making more of them than Rooney or Lingard.

4378~~~
Welbeck wasn't a striker, Martial isn't a winger.

4379~~~
And?

4380~~~
He's our only attacking player we have who actually looks any good. Imagine how impressive he'd be in a decent side. He's being asked to perform miracles in a side that struggles desperately to create anything.

4381~~~
And Welbeck wasn't a striker, Martial isn't a winger.

4382~~~
And?

4383~~~
I'd love to carry this on, but it's actually quite self explanatory

4384~~~
I never said he was a worse player than Welbeck. Just that he is offering less on the left wing. It doesnt matter what his best position is. Blame him, blame the manager, blame no one. Different argument.

4385~~~
He was our only threat for best part of the game and any time we looked like scoring it was based off his own work causing their defense problems.

4386~~~
Such an exciting player but his decision making at times is poor.

2-3 times in the second half he had Rooney in decent positions in the box but instead of looking for a pass he turned into a bunch of defenders and tried to dribble thorough them. Needs to work on using his team mates better instead of trying to do it all alone.

4387~~~
Really like him but wow is he greedy; almost no awareness of his team-mates, head down and try to dribble past 3 defenders every time.

4388~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Come on. Welbeck was absolute wank on the wing. For all his fancy play everywhere else, he never actually did anything productive and that's why he was sold. Never really dribbled past players, created chances or got in a chance. Martial consistently gets into good positions, goes past players, holds onto the ball better and creates more then Welbeck. There's nothing at all that Welbeck is actually better at then Martial

4389~~~
Martial stands out in our squad worse than a rolex on a homeless man.

Easily our most dangerous attacker.

4390~~~
A constant danger for the Liverpool defense. Perfrom well in nearly every game. Sign a few quality players and he will shine next season.

4391~~~
He's brilliant.

4392~~~
His touch and close control is insane. We need to build a proper team around him.

4393~~~
Most teams have two, and sometimes three, players marking him. Imagine, if we had just one more quality player in the team... Or, if Memphis would actually turn up one of these days.

4394~~~
Welbeck offering more on the wing? What was he offering, stolen watches?

4395~~~
Badly needs a rest though, but weve put ourselves in a position where we are reliant on him for counter attacks.

The rest is moreso for long term implications.

4396~~~
You are constantly talking shit. In every thread.

4397~~~
He is absolutely useless on the left wing. He only looks decent when he moves central.

4398~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Anyone with two eyes and a functioning brain can see that isn't true. What did Welbeck ever offer on the left wing? He couldn't dribble half as well as Martial and had zero goal threat so how was he an improvement?

4399~~~
No amount of <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> will change the fact that Martial offers very little from the left wing.
He is only playing there because that is the easiest way to shoe horn him in.

For all his fantastic ball carrying ability, he very rarely beats his fullback. He is constantly trying to run inside and runs into people.
He isnt a winger. He isnt doing well as a wide forward.
I really didnt think it was a controversial point. It wasnt even a criticism of Martial. Just saying he is not a great option out wide.

Still enjoying his honeymoon period on the caf by the looks of things.

4400~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4401~~~
If we can find another two young players of his ability, we are golden.

4402~~~
Did you watch the Chelsea game? He was taking Ivanovic apart time and again.

We didn't score in that game, through no fault of Martials. I don't think anyone will argue he isn't better as a striker, but to say he offers nothing or very little from the left isn't true. There are games when he does and games when he doesn't, like any 20 year old in world football.

4403~~~
Ok, you're right and everyone else is wrong. Got it.

4404~~~
Err, Martial had a great game on the left just a few days ago against Swansea, scoring one goal and assisting the other. Saying he's ''absolutely useless'' there is idiotic.

He still made things happen today, despite finding little joy against the 2-3 Liverpool players that were constantly surrounding him. He's also staying too wide for my liking (I guess due to Van Gaal's instructions as he demands stretching the play), but it's also because he received absolutely no support from the fullbacks whatsoever, so he couldn't really move centrally during our few attacks today.

Most of the time our players are passing the ball to him and just leave him against multiple defenders to see what happens. This over-reliance on him resembles our attacking play with Ronaldo a few years ago. ''Just pass him the ball and stand still''.

4405~~~
Yes he did. That assist was from the left wing too and not central..
Absolutely useless might have indeed been an overreaction. scratch that. was an overreaction.
Still think he is poor on the left wing.

My original post was with "why is he wasted on the left wing, move him up top" in mind. And no one here agrees with my opinion that he is poor out wide.


We probably do miss a full back like Evra too.

4406~~~
I'd like to see him up front as well, but it won't happen anytime soon, especially with Rooney's current goalscoring form. 

He's very good on the ball, but the lack of support from the fullbacks means he's constantly surrounded by at least two opposition defenders, so it's only natural he's not going to come out of those situations on top every time. After all, he's not Messi. If we had Shaw available, he'd have been much more effective. Our current fullbacks are useless in attack and are poor on the ball as well, but despite all of this, Martial is still creating chances and making things happen, which showcases his talent even more. 

Van Gaal's pragmatic system doesn't do him any favours. We're playing too defensively and the passiveness of the fullbacks is making things much more difficult for the attacking players. Not even Young has been able to constantly deliver on the wing as a right back. 

We need Shaw back, so Martial could be used like Neymar at Barcelona.

4407~~~
Quiet at times, and out of position, but he still looks incredibly dangerous when he's on the ball and gets space to attack. I thought he was quieter in the first half than the second, but there was one moment where he came back and challenged Firmino (I think that was it) completely unexpectedly. Love him for moments like that.

4408~~~
he massacred everton from the left side as well. He has had plenty of very good games for us from the left while playing in a team full of useless attacking play from the more senior players. His game vs City was good as well, created the lingard chance with a smoothly lobbed pass and went past city players like they weren't there.

I can not remember Welbeck doing alot from the wing.

4409~~~
Our best outfield player easily.

Need to surround him with better quality.

4410~~~
fecking Welbeck offered more on the wing <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Only on here. I'm sure Arsenal might take us up on a swap deal. The overrating of Welbeck will never die for some around this place.

4411~~~
He looks like he is capable of beating his man anytime he wants to, so I just wish he'd want that more often. He seems to slow down and take a touch or two more when he could easily keep the pace of the game and do more. Best outfield player of ours, though, no doubt about that.

4412~~~
He's streets ahead of Welbeck in any forward position

4413~~~
His defensive contribution today was enormous. He doesn't shy away from his responsibilities when playing on the wing like Memphis and Mata often do. It's not really expected of him, but he's a very good tackler.

4414~~~
I frickin' love this kid. Even when we can barely pass the ball he has magic in his feet when he gets the ball and drags us forward. Unlucky with the finish from a tough angle after some lovely work to create space. Set up a shot for Herrera. Beat his defender for dead before Sakho blocked his shot. And his defending for the Firmino chance was brilliant. It's hard to shine when the attack simply doesn't work, but I love how assured he is, and doesn't end up looking clumsy all the time due to a lack of cohesion in those around him. That's the sign of a good player, when your technique and quality on the ball stands out even when the team has played poorly in attack.

4415~~~
Thought he was our best player today, not sure how De Gea got man of the match

4416~~~
Imagine what Martial could do for United once we set him up with a proper attacking partner.  Say, Greizmann.

4417~~~
Rooney is back. But we could do with another yes.

4418~~~
It's funny cause he has a dribbling style that you think he was lucky there like the Liverpool goal but then when he keeps doing it you realise he actually means it......

4419~~~

He has a surprise for us soon it seems...

4420~~~
We're signing someone <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4421~~~
He discovered how to get into super saiyan mode <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4422~~~
Probably the birth of his second child.

4423~~~
LVG has probably told him he can start in the middle against Southampton!

4424~~~
Might be that he's close to 1m followers and is planning a giveaway but a new signing is the dream.

4425~~~
First thing I thought as well <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4426~~~
Only just realised, while watching MOTD, that he won the corner that led to the goal. Just give this lad the ball and let him run at full backs. Defensive chaos ensues.

4427~~~
I hope it's not that he's getting a divorce.

4428~~~
We need to really give him incentives to stay, like playing more exciting, attacking football, getting rid of Rooney, and getting 1-2 proper wingers.

4429~~~

Good lad, gave away signed official match jersey to his 1 millionth Instagram follower.

4431~~~
Not just the full backs, the AM needs to be closer to him too some times. 

We dont move forward well as a team. And we really should leave him up when we are defending corners, no need to bring eveyone back and have no outlet.

4432~~~

The Scan of the contract of Sale between AS Monaco and United for Martial.

4433~~~
I think it's ridiculous something like that has been made public. Is that how Monaco operate?
Seems Monaco will get percentage of any profit on any transfer. Hopefully that is very very far away.

4434~~~
Wow just wow...
But all in all if he is all that we will all be so happy..

4435~~~
So the agreement also reveals AS Monaco is eligible for payment if we sell him for a profit.

4436~~~
Well.. We desperately wanted him. Monaco owned Woody. 

Not my money and I'm pleased he's here.

4437~~~
Easy solution: Never sell. 

Who the fcuk sells a worldie talent like Martial, anyway? Not United (hopefully), that's for sure. (pretty please)

4438~~~
This deal has changed the landscape for young players from Europe IMO. Shalke will be looking for £35m at least for Sane. Breel Embolo will be close to £30m.

4439~~~
Interesting reading. Looks like we will only be due a sell on % if we sell him before close of the 2018 summer window and he hasn't been nominated for Baloon d'or or scored 25 times for us in a season or played 25 times for France. Sell on only comes into play for fees over 60 million euros. Seems unlikely in that case we will pay anything. If he is that good we aren't going to sell him in 2 years.

Interesting clause 4.5 forbids to details of the contract to be made public! Unfortunately any problems are to be addresssed to Fifa.

4440~~~
They have already broken it.

4441~~~
Yep hence why I was pointing it out<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4442~~~
Great, so we won't have to pay them the 10 mil when he wins the Balloon Door.

4443~~~
our transfer agreement for Martial

<a class="externalLink" href="http://en.youscribe.com/catalogue/tous/leisure-and-hobbies/sports/contrat-anthony-martial-2690581" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://en.youscribe.com/catalogue/tous/leisure-and-hobbies/sports/contrat-anthony-martial-2690581</a>

4444~~~
50m Euro up front then, 20m in add ons that will almost certainly be paid. And 10m if he wins the Balon d'Or.

4445~~~
Serious data breach here btw. Ibans, fax numbers, etc.

4446~~~
The way I read it, it's 10 mil the moment he's on the list for the Balon d'Or.

4447~~~
Monaco will be campaigning hard for that then <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4448~~~
It says Balon d´Or shortlist, which is 25 I think?

Looks like he'll definitely cost us the full 80 million. Let's hope he stays with us for a long time.

4449~~~
A shining light in a turgid season

4450~~~
It's amateurish from Monaco. I can't see us being pleased about it.

4451~~~
They also get a percentage if we sell for more than 80 million. If we sell for 90 million, they get 5 million.

4452~~~
Calling Edward Woodward "Ed" in an official agreement? I call BS.

4453~~~
Bargain.

4454~~~
Yup, was just about to post this. Very likely to be bullshit.

4455~~~
Also, after seeing some agreements regarding ending of contracts for absolutely dead-normal employees of dead-normal regional companies, I doubt something involving enough money to fund a minor state is done in a 3 page fax paper.

4456~~~
Something similar has just been leaked about Mangala. The same source that has been leaking documents for months. Journalists believe the documents are authentic.

4457~~~
A multimillion euro document in that font as well??

And you're right, surely a transfer agreement would run into tens of pages.

Edit: no witness/attorney signatures our regulatory body stamps either

4458~~~
I'm jumping on the bullshit train too

4459~~~
I think this is the real one.

Martial and Vardy the joint fastest players in the league.

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4461~~~
Surely this has got to add weight to the fact that we need to buy a strike partner for him that will bring out his best qualities. The team should be built around him for the next 5 years at least.

4462~~~
martial-kane for me.

4463~~~
Yes and we won't have to complain about it next time we'll try to sign a talented young player.

4464~~~
Does it? We could also just by a right winger and play 4-3-3 with Martial up top looking to use his pace to get in behind, or Martial out left and Memphis up top or not a starter.

4465~~~
It's just so exciting to have the best young talent in Europe in our team. I get the same feeling I had when I watched a young Ronaldo and Rooney line up for us a decade ago. He's just a bit special.

4466~~~
If we find that, then we are Barcelona.

4467~~~
With Rooney back in some form, id rest Martial a bit.

Kid or not, he's played too much football.

4468~~~
Rooney himself was playing just as much at the same age and since he was 16. Henry too (at 20)

4469~~~
He has just had a week off! He is twenty and fully physically developed as well, not 17 and still growing.

4470~~~
Poor today, never really got into the game.

4471~~~
Well said!
Oh baby, a triple!

4472~~~
Seemed as confused as anyone else on the pitch as to where he was playing and what to do... Can't wait to see him under a new manager

4473~~~
Very quiet today. Needs to play centrally.

4474~~~
Disappointed we didn't see him link up with Borthwick-Jackson with those inside channel passes, only chance I remember from him was when he was running at 3 players.

4475~~~
Few months with us and he's now shit. What a club.

4476~~~
Scored 4 in his first 4.. Next 24 games.. 4 goals. 3 assists.
3 goals and an assist in his last 18


Clearly has the talent.. But not doing enough.

4477~~~
He's played too much at his young age but that's because he's one of our best players. Badly needs a rest now.

4478~~~
He is constantly double and triple teamed. He is clearly knackered as well.

4479~~~
Send him out on loan, so Van Gaal can't infest him enough with his shit on a stick. Or he's fecked.

4480~~~
We've ruined him. Players will be strongly advised against joining us.

4481~~~
Came in to say this. He looks absolutely knackered - the fact that the teams know that he is the biggest threat and double/triply up on him doesn't help either. Poor game from him, but he needs a break so badly.

4482~~~
He looked so frustrated, like everything is relying on him (which in a way it kinda is) to be our threat, our pace, our running, our counter attack.
Hes only 20, and he really should have not played as much as he had so far for us. Were putting him into total burnout so early into his United career.

How many of those first 4 were up front? It still is mind boggling he was playing up front, scoring, and then we go and drop him to the wing. For a game like this, there is no reason why we couldnt play two up top so he can be a threat in behind to make defenders drop deep thus freeing up space for Rooney / Mata to occupy between the lines.

4483~~~
We couldn't even string two passes together due to our inability to look like a professional football team when under pressure, so no point commenting on Martial, to be fair. He and Rooney had absolutely no support and in the couple of occasions when we got near their box, Lingard was too busy avoiding his team mates with his crosses.

4484~~~
A lot of different players follow this pattern: start off well, then go drastically downhill.
I wonder if this is coincidence or something is happening in our club which is causing this.

4485~~~
Doubling and tripling a player is not unheard of.
When 3 players mark 1 player, it is upto Martial's team-mates to create/score a goal, by using the free space which will be made available for them to operate in.
Unfortunately, our attackers are so bad (worst that I've seen at MUFC, since I started supporting them 20 years ago), that they are unable to take advantage.

4486~~~
Had the bollocks to take risks but nothing came off for him, Southampton had too many men around him.

4487~~~
I'm getting frustrated with him, whilst I'm aware he's being marked to buggery, I'm also aware he's running straight into defenders. 

Fantastic talent, just needs the pressure lifted off him a little, I'm pretty certain he's being sent out as the only player allowed to express himself. It's as if Van Gaal is trying to use him as his Robben, unfortunately, he's not the running juggernaut of the dutch man as of yet.

4488~~~
I bet the montage of his weak passes, shots, runs etc would be long as his good ones. But he's the only one who can lift you off your seats so he gets the pass for this season at least.

4489~~~
He was poor yesterday. He shouldn't try to beat all defenders on his own so often even though he lacks enough support from Rooney and the other players. I blame also LVG because shifting Martial's positions across the attacking line in order to make room for Rooney is daft and is already backfiring.

4490~~~
Any chance you have a link to that article?

4491~~~
Not sure if this was the article, but here's David James of all people writing about it.

Not the article <a class="username" data-user="36088, @Kraftwerker" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/36088/">@Kraftwerker</a> but an interesting read, nonetheless.

Cheers

4494~~~
Reminds me of Januzaj under Moyes. 

Constantly doubled/tripled up on and looks shattered because he's used far too frequently for a young player.

4495~~~
Yesterday was probably his worst game for us, he needs a rest really.

4496~~~
Such a fantastic player and needs help. Has all the ability in the world but is literally our only attacker who has been able to do anything of note all season.

I think people should remember how young he is when he has an off day and also remember his much responsibility lays on his shoulders.

4497~~~
Freaking love this guy. He is already my favourite player. I can really relate to his personality as well.

4498~~~
I think am watching a different player from most people. I'd start off by say he looks tired but his form is down to him not playing off the ball. 
For a guy that's being doubled up on he has to play smart and be unpredictable, not only that he doesn't get involved in counters unless the build up is through him.

4499~~~
^You're right there. He should be a bit more selfish and look to make runs behind defenders and be on their shoulders. 

His preference to having ball to feet and trying to dribble himself into dangerous positions is wearing him and the team down in terms of more effective opportunities. 

But the kid is 19 and our system/style is fecking sh|te. 

This is not a functioning team where players are operating at even 60% of their 'level'.

4500~~~
Ronaldo was the same at times in his early days. Tried to do it all himself and if he wasnt involved in the build up was either uninterested or unable to add to an attack. Martial is also every bit as capable at going past people and causing problems as he was, so i think he will just be fine once he's had a few more years.

4501~~~
I think whoever is the next manager will have to decide where his position is and play him there all of the time, this will also dictate our transfer targets.

4502~~~
Think it might be the other way around, sort of. See what star we can get and then pick Martial's position. If we sign someone who is much more effective centrally then Martial will likely play wide and vice versa.

Also, it's possible we'll play 2 up top, still. Simeone has shown 4-4-2 can work (and Pellegrini sort of, too) and there's a case to be made that Schneiderlin is best in a 2 man midfield since he lacks the passing game you want from a DM, but he's mobile enough to be defensively still effective with only one partner. I could see something like this:

-----Martial---<i>Striker-----</i>
Memphis-------------<i>Winger
-----------</i>Herrera--------
-------Schneiderlin--------

being the future, depending on the manager.

4503~~~
Simeone's 4-4-2 only works because they are all very disciplined and work hard, I can't see Herrera or Memphis excelling in that system to be honest, and no matter who we get as manager I can't see them playing Herrera in a midfield 2, ideally he needs a 4-3-3 system to really shine.

4504~~~
Has anybody else noticed he seems to say "puta" in frustration when missing a chance? Puta meaning "feck" in Spanish.

Is there a French word that is similar to puta that could be used for the same thing? I just thought that it was odd.

4505~~~
Actually, he says "putain", which is the same thing.

4506~~~
Playing 90mins every fecking game. We are running him into the ground.

4507~~~
Philosophy.

4508~~~
Putain (as JPRouve said). In English, it would be letting out a big 'Feck'.

4509~~~

What happened with that gutter-press story about him being a LOVE RAT? Did it predictably turn out to be bollocks?

4512~~~
Griezmann/Dybala
--------------------Sane/Mahrez

Kane and Griezmann would be amazing, but I think we wouldn't have a good balance in a 442. With those players, I would play 433:

4513~~~
That poor RB, I don't think he has stopped Martial once all game.

4514~~~
I can't help but feel sorry for Christie tonight, he probably thought he was a good player until tonight...

4515~~~
Martial - Lukaku/Kane - Deulofeu would be an attacking line-up i'd watch every single minute they played. He's one of my favourite players to watch, he's brilliant.

4516~~~
Motm for me today. Constant menace

4517~~~
He's a genius.

4518~~~
Can't believe someone compared him to Welbeck in the match thread, insane

4519~~~
Sub him off, for feck's sake. He's playing 90 minutes every week and we have no alternative to him.

4520~~~
This guy is is going to be some player, he is already a level above anyone else in this team and still only 20 years old.

4521~~~
Finds it so easy to get past his man when he is on form.

Not sure if he has stepped up today or the drop in quality of opposition is the reason.. but he can do that.. And he will only get better/smarter at dealing with better defenders

4522~~~
One more player like him on the right wing and we may have something that look like a set of complete wings.

4523~~~
The only attacking spark we have. We'd be absolutely fecked without him

4524~~~
fecking brilliant.

4525~~~
A level above everyone else.

4526~~~
Oozes quality.

4527~~~
He's brilliant. His end product needs to be much better, but that only comes with experience. Heaven knows where we'd be without him.

4528~~~
He's so good, frightening potential this guy.

4529~~~
its been refreshing to see a palyer who can take on players but if he cant deliver better end product its worthless, finally he managed to cut back better to Mata, at the and of the day he's as effective as Lingard..

4530~~~
Absurdly talented. The boy has magic in his feet.

4531~~~
Was class today, should've definitely scored though on a couple of occasions

4532~~~
Don't mind him on the left so much any more, you can always bet on this guy to beat his man somehow. Really can't wait to see Shaw and Martial on the left <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4533~~~
Just needs to work on his finishing and shooting. Apart from that he is grand already.

4534~~~
Imagine what he will be like when he decides not to walk the ball into the net? 

If he can develop his shooting range he will be 1 hell of a player.

4535~~~
That was a Ronaldo-esque performance today, and it was fecking fantastic to watch.

4536~~~
Makes it look so easy. Just walks past players. Awesome!

4537~~~
Such a bargain.

4538~~~
we need two more of him. one for the left one for the right and one for the Striker <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4539~~~
What a player he is. Credit to the club for signing him when most of us doubted the signing.

4540~~~
He just goes by players for fun. Electrifying speed and light on his feet. He is legit and at such a young age it is frightening to envision what he will become.

4541~~~
10/10.

4542~~~
7/10! We were playing a Championship that are in terrible form. It is the least we should expect from our record signing.

4543~~~
Preach it brother. No matter the costs, every million well spent even if it would be only two deals for the whole summer.

4544~~~
Couldn't give a feck. Maybe it's because I've been subjected (like the rest of our fans) to dire shite all season. 10/10 for me.

4545~~~
Class

4546~~~
he is the only player in the side who actually excites you watching the game

4547~~~
our record signing is at PSG

4548~~~
He's very exciting, poor opposition today but he was by far our most threatening forward, he's the only forward player we have I want to see starting next season.

4549~~~
Gets into so many shooting positions but refuses to pull the trigger.

4550~~~
Depends on what exchange rate you go by:-

<a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_association_football_transfers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_association_football_transfers</a>

Lets hope we have to pay more add ons for Martial than we did Di Maria!

4551~~~
Had to block a few idiots in the match day thread who referred to him as Welbeck or "shit".

4552~~~
Already a brilliant player, but once he improves his shooting technique he's going to have it all. Could really become one of the top few players around if he fixes that one part of his game.

4553~~~
Blind's goal made me wonder how many more assists he would get if we regularly got more men in the box.

4554~~~
It's weird how when he plays as an inverted winger, he seems a lot better at going on the outside onto his weaker foot then cutting in for a shot. Basically does the opposite of memphis when on the wing

4555~~~
Will be BPITW. He's just crazy talented.

4556~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EabWq-5VKEg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

4557~~~
He's what we all wished Welbeck could of been. What a player.

4558~~~
Can't wait to see him under a different manager and system.

<span style="color: #ffffff">At this club, of course...</span>

4559~~~
Imagine if we had him and ADM on the wings. . Or Martial, ADM and Shaw linking down the left.

4560~~~
Shaw and Martial on the left could be phenomenal.

4561~~~
Welbeck never showed 10% of the talent this lad has got. He's unbelievable.

4562~~~
Really good to watch. Obviously still has to work on decision making and end product but he is a gem. Blind pipped him for MOTM IMO though.

4563~~~
He's an absolute gem. Wish we had more like him.

4564~~~
Really pisses me off that Di Maria quit so early and didn't give it 1 more season. With a player like martial he could have had a good target to pass too. 

I know he never really had his heart in it but it's a shame what could have been

4565~~~
Were going to burn him out if were not careful. Right now he wont feel the effects of it but long term I think it may hurt him. Cant remember the last time he had a good rest.

4566~~~
Such a talent! He's by far our best attacking outlet.

4567~~~
Anthony Martian. He's out of this world.

4568~~~
Signing a proper winger (s) in the summer should be TOP priority o we can play him up top more often. He's outrageously good

4569~~~
Nice VDO .  He's already done some very cool things!

4570~~~
Surprised he's only got 5 assists this season. 

Off the top of my head I remember the one where put it in off Rooney's thigh, won the penalty for a goal (WB?) and two last night.

4571~~~
Maybe he is a martian and doesn't burn out.

4572~~~
It's sad that we can't afford to rest him even against Derby County. He can't play every game till the end of the season, surely?

4573~~~
He was superb last night but like others have said will need a break at some point however doesn't seem likely reinforcements are arriving anytime soon unfortunately.

4574~~~
I don't think he needs a break actually, maybe one after the Euro and that's it. The lad is young, strong and raring to go. He needs as much game time as possible, as long as he doesn't get injured. What fecked up the career of players like Owen and fat Ronaldo was injuries, you can argue it's partly due to them being burn out but I think a modern footballer should be able to play every week barring injuries across the season.

4575~~~
His dribbling & close control of the ball in tight spaces is just amazing <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I don't think he needs a break - we know how LVG is regarding his "red zone" and close monitoring of the condition of players, if him or his staff felt Martial was burnt out we would have seen some rotation.

4576~~~
This lad is just special, I just hope we can build an excellent team around him for him to thrive in.

4577~~~
As long as he's playing out wide, we should work at isolating him vs the full back. Will always have the beat of him.

4578~~~
What a talent. Pretty much the one bit of joy this season has given us. Watching Martial.

4579~~~
Him and Shaw would be a crazy good left flank. With that being said, what's Martials best position anyway?

4580~~~
For now, I'd say on the wing. Sees a lot more of the ball, very rarely has his back to goal and has more room to use pace and dribbling skills. 

If we get a Martial type player on the right wing next season, we'll be very dangerous, in my opinion.

4581~~~
Before his injury, Shaw was developing an excellent relationship with Memphis and we have seen how Shaw's absence has negatively affected Memphis' performances. I can see a great relationship developing between Martial & CBJ - they seem to really understand each-other position and passing wise and this bodes very well for the future.. will be interesting to see where this leaves us when Shaw eventually comes back.

4582~~~
Has to be left wing for me. He can beat players from wide in a way none of our other players can. We have players who can finish if Martial can get the crosses in, but we don't have players who can do what Martial does.

4583~~~
We haven't had a player as good at taking on full backs as him in years. He should be given more freedom to run at the opposition than he has so far.

4584~~~
Not disagreeing but I'm starting to wonder how much this actually has an effect.

We've protected the likes of Jones, Welbeck, Cleverley somewhat early in their careers and it never paid off. We protected Smalling too yet he's had the least injuries under LvG where he's been the mainstay of our defence, although granted he may have just grown out of all the injuries.

I wonder if there's a case for modern young footballers needing to be played often to put an expectation on them to deliver performances, maintain focus and protect them from distractions outside of football. I think there might be a conditioning angle too, in that at the age of 19/20, its a good age to get a player's body comfortable playing 40-50 games a season.

Burnouts are a risk but it could be offset somewhat by the points above. I think Rio, Rooney and Lampard were examples of young players given responsibility at a 19/20 which has worked out well.

4585~~~
I think it'll do Januzaj a world of good having a new star pupil in the class. Right now Martial is two levels above him. Quicker, stronger and more polished.

4586~~~
Are we talking about injuries or ability? In terms of ability, the problem I have with those players is the number of positions theyve had (eg Jones as played CB, RB, DM) so I dont know if hes excelled at one or just been ok at all. Welbeck another example of somebody who has swapped between striker and LM. And in terms of injuries, Ithink somebody like Cleveley was unlucky (dont think he fully recovered from that Davies foul). 

The argument obviously is our handling of Giggs and ronaldo (didnt Ronaldo get Xmas time off and then he would come back stronger second half of the season). 
Then I look at people like Owen and Fowler who suffered later in their career.

I do think youre right cos you also look at somebody like Messi and think, this guy keeps going. Would love to see a study on this, but i would still lean towards people who have long careers would be managed better early in their career

4587~~~
It is the combination of pace, power and ability on the ball. You don't see many players with that blend of attributes. The two Ronaldos are the only two that I can think of right now.

4588~~~
Yeah, quick players are rarely agile dribblers. People like Walcott/Bale etc never need to learn how to slalom or keep the ball close at a young age as their pace just makes it too easy for them. Only when they come up against proper athletes does this become more important. He's such an exciting player, you really do wonder how good he could be. I just hope we can get some other better players around him to bring out his full potential.

4589~~~
He's going to be scarily good when he improves his end product even more. Not sure which position I prefer him in but we certainly need performances like that from wide areas!

4590~~~
Some players just scream that they are special and will be guns in the future.

Martial is one of them.

4591~~~
Martial looks like a fantastic prospect.

Even playing in this underwhelming United team he oozes quality

4592~~~
Under Giggs, I reckon he'd be utilised as a striker. Under Mourinho, it'd be as a wide forward.

4593~~~
I think that the praise Martial gets about a good performance against a shit defence is a bit over the top.

The real test is against teams from the top half of the PL and he is very inconsistent against them.

Against Southampton (at OT) he was very poor. His decision making hasn't been particularly good recently, the end product of his dribbles against quality defenders is often zero.

Of course, he's an exciting talent and I have praised him a lot on here. I was surprised how good he was in the first month or so. The money seem to be well spent. But as things stand right now he has a long way to go before becoming a genuine world class forward.

4594~~~
Barkley?

4595~~~
Nah.

4596~~~
Fancy elaborating?

4597~~~
He doesn't have the close control of Martial and I don't think he is as strong or fast. Barkley has a high top speed with the ball but isn't that quick off the mark for me.

Barkley has a better strike from range but is better at 'attacking the space' rather than as a pure dribbler IMO.

4598~~~
He's already a really really good player.

As for the big games this season:

Was easily the best player on the park when we played City.

Was the best attacker on the park against Chelsea.

Was our most useful attacking outlet vs Liverpool away from home albeit it was in a poor attacking display from us,

Destroyed Liverpool's defence scoring THAT goal at home.

Didn't play against Spurs.

In what was billed as our biggest game of the season and one that could have taken us into the knockout phase of the CL, scored the opening goal against Wolfsburg after which we sadly did lose.

We aren't a great attacking side so naturally his statistics aren't as good as they'd have been if he was playing this well for a team like Bayern or even City. Once we develop our attack and add some better players around him you'll see similar performances rewarded with more wins and assists rather than simply being one of the best in dull games.

4599~~~
Yep. His output is only decent right now, but when you look at it like his first season in the prem, playing on the wing mostly, and having just turned 20, it looks a lot better. Especially in this united side. Put him in a free flowing attacking side, like arsenal, city or even Leicester, or united teams of old, and I reckon he would have at least double the goals he has now. 

Ignoring the goals and assists, his all around game is so good, can't wait to see how he is when he gets more quality around him and more freedom.

4600~~~
If/when he adds more conviction and experience to his finishing, aerial game and movement we could have our own Weah-Eto'o hybrid. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4601~~~
Maybe I'm being a bit harsh because I don't want to excuse some of his not so good performances and low productivity only with Rooney, Mata and the other being crap for most of the season. He has been fantastic in the first month or so and had some brilliant games since then as well. Maybe LVG has relied too much on him and failed to give him some rest, apart from changing his position on the pitch. I'm afraid he won't be fresh enough till the end of the season. The most difficult games are ahead.

4602~~~
As far back as Palace away teams were already doubling up on him. Pardew was very complimentary to him saying he is the only one worth worrying about. Neutralise him and we are limp

4603~~~
True, he needs better support from the other forwards and midfieders.

4604~~~
Watch Stoke gang up on him and we turn to shite. It's too predictable.

4605~~~
But think of all that space it would leave the likes of Rooney and Lingard in... Quaking in their boots.

4606~~~
What a bloody goal. This boy. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4607~~~
Suck it!

4608~~~
What a bloody goal. This boy. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4609~~~
Have any manager you like, if we can develop this guy correctly he can carry us to titles on his own.

4610~~~

4611~~~
Not utter garbage this lad, is he?

4612~~~
Reminds me of the Blackburn manager at the time when Valencia was on song "we tried to double up on him, but it was useless". Martial can dribble on top of that.

4613~~~
Literally the next Henry.

4614~~~
Whoever gave the green light to sign this boy (be it LVG or Woody), well done!

4615~~~
I <i>literally</i> doubt that.

4616~~~
He's been best player in the world his age.

4617~~~
Tomorrow's headline

The Sun: <i>"Martial shines as Guardiola plots move for youngster" <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>
</i>
Lad is just filthy. Pure and other filthy good

4618~~~
The best bit about him, he makes football fun to watch, which it should be.

4619~~~
I absolutely love the guy. Best talent we've had since Ronaldo.

4620~~~
Why?

4621~~~
What a finish,thought it was going to go over the bar.

4622~~~
Semantically, I doubt you can literally be anyone else but yourself. Therefore, he can figuratively, seeing as that means metaphorically, speaking become the next Henry. I'm just being a dick.

4623~~~
Lovely goal, and a bit different to what he's scored for us. He keeps on showing that he's got more and more in his locker

4624~~~
I haven't been this excited about a United player since the days of Ronaldo, he really is a joy to watch.

4625~~~
Pretty convinced this is his best position. Not many can do a better job than him in this left forward role.

4626~~~
Ridiculously good at running at the defender. Creates a chance for himself or somebody else every 10 minutes. 

I think his decision making has improved a lot since joining.

4627~~~
I have been saying this all season, he is to far up the pitch when he receives the ball when playing centrally, he needs to receive it deeper so that he can run at defenders at high speed.

4628~~~
Please, for once, sub him off now. It's not often we can afford it but even when we can, he still plays 90 mins for some reason. When was the last time he got a break?

Edit: Thank you! Could've been earlier but I'm content.

4629~~~
Do you prefer Martial as a striker or left winger?

4630~~~
Striker in the long run, but for now LW since he's much more involved that way.

4631~~~
Gladly<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4632~~~
What a player.

4633~~~
We've basically signed the next Messi.

4634~~~
I hope we don't burn him out, especially with the Euros coming up too.

4635~~~
He has the potential to be better imo.

4636~~~
If he is 70% of Henry I will be happy

4637~~~
Where's that ''we need to sign the next Messi'' thread gone to? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4638~~~
Brilliant.

4639~~~
Best young player in world football. I struggle to think of anyone better.

4640~~~
Not far wrong really! In terms of top talents he's pretty much it! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4641~~~
Agreed but I think this lad is even more direct and explosive. His mentality is spectacular.. one of the most composed and confident players I've ever seen. Always felt Henry had a faux arrogance.. something which held him back from being a proper all time great and didn't quite match the likes of R9, Eusebio (truly great strikers). Whereas Martial looks like someone who could dominate CL finals and world cups.. we are truly blessed to have him.

4642~~~
Never would have thought he'd turn out this amazing. Just remembering the outrage on here when we signed him is pretty hilarious <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I do prefer him on the left now. He's got so much more to his game.

4643~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4644~~~
His potential is frightening.

This is his 1st season in the Prem and he's been exceptional. Blown us all away.

4645~~~
Excellent performance again, I really like him in this left sided role.  Him and Rooney seem to have been mixing well the last couple of games which is a great sign.  His dribbling is top notch and his finishing will improve in consistency with time.  In short he's gonna be a hell of a player.

4646~~~
He's 20 years old, in the prime of his life. A great physical specimen. 

At 20 Ronaldo had already had 90 appearances for us in the previous two seasons and would add another 47 in that season. 

He's the sort of guy you just need give as many games to as possible. He's only going to grow and grow.

4647~~~
He's better on the left for now at least I think. He's simply very very good beating his fullback. The rapid change of feet for the goal against Liverpool looked kind of fluky at first, since then he continues to bamboozle defenders with the same footwork over and over again.

4648~~~
He is absolutely sublime.

4649~~~
He's fantastic.

4650~~~
The first touch that set up his shot for the goal was pure magic.

4651~~~

4652~~~
Phenomenal talent <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4653~~~
I know it will be hard for people to believe but Henry at this age could never dribble as well as Martial can. Martial's dribbling is absolutely top notch.

4654~~~
Only going to get better. Our main striker for years to come. A massive fan of his style of play.

4655~~~
Think that position suits him down to the ground. I don't want to tempt fate but if we continue to strengthen and stop feeling sorry for ourselves we'll be alright. Gives us a great option out wide.

4656~~~
Lovely cutbacks from him too, really like the partnership he's forming with Borthwick-Jackson.

4657~~~
Brilliant touch and dribbling. He looks like he has the ball on a piece of string

4658~~~
I bloody hope he stays with us long term, because he is going to be something special if he keeps improving!

4659~~~
Just set up the Liverpool goal perfectly that headline. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4660~~~
Frightening on the left. That finish. Gawd.

We have an absolute worldie on our hands here.

4661~~~
Excellent game from him tonight, just electric pace combined with slick footwork and better finals balls, he also has the ideal temperament that you want in a young player, Black Ice!

4662~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4663~~~
SAF used to send Ronaldo on holidays when he was 20 go recuperate. 20 year olds are not at their peak physical condition and need to be nurtured carefully.

4664~~~
Just an amazing player

4665~~~
Assists, goals and then more assists.

Too fast for ya brah.

4666~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4667~~~
£58 million?

Bet Monaco are wishing they made us pay more.

4668~~~
Good performance. Perhaps, we are doing the right thing playing him out wide at the moment, so he can develop his all round game more.

4669~~~
If he's going to play left wing consistently he needs to learn how to cross the ball better, but what a fecking player we've got here.

4670~~~
He's ballon d'or material. Simple.

4671~~~
Fair point. I don't see any signs of fatigue  though, we seem to be wary of "the red zone" so you'd hope we'll rest him when needs be.

4672~~~
As far as I'm concerned, he doesn't need to cross the ball. I'd much prefer he keeps sticking to a more inside forward role, in which he can more so pick a pass in the box, or take on his man.

4673~~~
I'm not sure about that.

4674~~~
He's 20 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4675~~~
I think Martial had a 'dip' earlier in the season but he's seemed to have got strong again. There's too much to fight for, to let have a rest. I think he's enjoying it too. LVG might have subbed him to get him an applause for his performance.

4676~~~
I hope we nurture a selfish streak in him.

4677~~~
Top talent looks very confident after Derby game. I always thought for player his age coming to our league with a huge price tag that 10 goals would be a great return, he has 9 so far and a fair few assists. Hopefully he can continue this fine form into the coming months as when playing like this he is near enough unstoppable. The front three right now with Mata at 10 looks to be a good understanding despite how limited Lingard is, hope LvG doesn't tinker too much.

4678~~~
One thing tonight is that we seemed to play more of a 4-3-3 at times, with Martial and Lingard closer to Rooney than the touchline, with CBJ especially providing the width on the left.

4679~~~
With him on the left, we need to find a way to fit Depay into the side. Maybe try Depay on the right with Mata throw the middle. That could be some counter attacking team.

4680~~~
Superstar. An absolute joy to watch.

4681~~~
I'd love to see us try and make Memphis a right winger. He favours his right so much, yet clearly prefers to play from the left. We've seen a few times that he's got a decent cross on him so I'd love to see us work on that over the next few months.

4682~~~
Perhaps up front? LVG did try it a few times, did it against Watford and he looked decent then. Though that'd mean pushing Rooney back which would be unfair considering his form.

4683~~~
I'd like to see this if he could get his head right and build some confidence. Right now though I think Januzaj on the right would be very good, he has miles more technique and ability than Lingard and has proved he can be a top player with a run of games. Just no more Mata on the right!

4684~~~
Don't think he'll ever have the range of magic Henry did but he can be more consistent if we develop him well.

4685~~~
Defenders might be on to him more in his 2nd season but he seems that good he'll still find a way to get past them. The potential of him is looking very good.
Great finish from him tonight

4686~~~
Maybe a floating three or four of Martial / Memphis and one other (ideally Muller lol)

4687~~~
Griezmann

4688~~~
Henry was better from distance but Martial is a better dribbler IMO. The likes of Henery, Ronaldo, Messi etc, they produced performances like Martial's tonight consistently over a full season, that is the challenge for Martial.

4689~~~
Sizzling hot!

Just imagine how good he'll be in 24 months when he is even bigger, even faster, has even better first touch and even better finishing.

He must be the highest achieving 19 year old in world football right now?  And he is truly benefitting from LVGs small squad policy by getting loads and loads of game time.

In a season of negatives, Martial is an LVG success from which we will enjoy years after LVG leaves.

4690~~~
Why not?  Top quality strikers continue to evolve and develop up to the age of 25.  The great thing for him at such at such a young is he'll get 45+ games a year in our current squad.  

His contemporaries like januzaj, Wilson and Depay can only dream of that kind of exposure right now.

4691~~~
Can't get enough of this thread. You'd forget the doom and gloom while reading this thread.

4692~~~
Sublime.

4693~~~
Looks like he can become a genuine World Class player

4694~~~
Is Black Ice his actual nickname or did you come up with that? suits him perfectly.

4695~~~
Oh yeah, good shout. TBH, I think something like that is the way forward, it doesnt restrict Martial and Memphis and can decrease the chances of them being man marked or double teamed out of a game.

Kinda like how we played the 460 at times with Saha, Rooney, Ronaldo, Giggs (and carrick scholes sitting).

4696~~~
His shooting is the poorest part of his game IMO. It's what sets him apart from Henry. Henry had a terrific shot with his right leg.

4697~~~
Wow.

4698~~~
Mean that some of Henry's rangy strikes and volleys oozed an air of arrogance that Martial doesn't. Martial could go further than Henry in terms of glacial composure in front of goal though.

4699~~~
Can he only shoot with the inside of his foot?

4700~~~
Sane, Griezmann or Dybala would be also great with Martial and Memphis.

4701~~~
Doesn't matter if he can place it like that.

4702~~~
What about at 20 years of age?

4703~~~
Think he had a go at the near post with his laces when he went past Johnson. He probably actually should have used the inside of his foot and gone for the far corner like he normally does!

4704~~~
My thoughts exactly...

4705~~~
He needs to played wide with the current state of affairs but I think he'll be best as an a roaming out and out forward.

Playing out wide now will make him an all round better forward in the long run, I think. And it takes the pressure of him to score goals now.

I'd like Memphis to have another go up front in place of Rooney. The issue is I don't think Memphis would be able to operate with his back to goal.

Something I'd like to see is a front two of Memphis and Martial playing high and wide with Rooney/Herrera/Mata playing deeper and feeding them.

4706~~~
As a wide man cutting in he will be trying that all day but if he does end up playing central then he needs to learn how to shoot through his laces.  
Its not a criticism it's that he doesn't look comfortable doing it

4707~~~
No! You're not being a dick. Misuse of the word literal is heart breaking. Another I've noticed quite a trend of on here lately is "it's criminal that we're playing x". No. It's not criminal.

4708~~~
I thought, okay its his first season, he would be trying to find his feet and somehow he is our best and most exciting player and he certainly improved in a way we can see it. What a player he can be, my only concern is whether we can keep him until the end of his career. Hope we find a manager next window who will try to win something with this team to give players like him and deGea a hope and they will stay..

4709~~~
even as a 20 years old? I dont think he was that good at 20... but you're right his shooting looks like one of his biggest weaknesses

4710~~~
To be honest I don't know. I Was too young. I also don't know to what extent a great shooting technique can be developed.

4711~~~
More direct type of play. Him, Depay and a certain someone (Griezmann) would be a great interchangeable pacey front three.

4712~~~
Man of the match yet again, he's been phenomenal for us down that left side in the last couple of matches. I would like to see him in a more central role long term though. His goal was class, nothing any goalkeeper could've done about it.

4713~~~
This boy is unbelievable. If he keeps his head down and continues to work hard - Messi and Ronnie be kissing goodbye to that Ballon D'Or trophy. He really has frightening potential.
Reminds of Brazilian Ronaldo actually...

4714~~~
He is so so good. It is crazy to think that he is only 20 years of age. 
If he stays fit he will become a phenomenal footballer.

4715~~~
He seems to like playing in close proximity with Mata... two of them work nicely off each other.

4716~~~
Thats been the biggest change recently. He is simply playing closer to everyone around him.

4717~~~
I saw it when he first came, that he has this understanding with Mata. It was a brief period, and never understood why that wasn't built on. In any case, glad it's happening now. Let's hope it continues.

4718~~~
Shit, get yourself to the nearest hospital with a cardiac unit asap then.

4719~~~
I agree, has time to improve. Maybe Memphis can teach him a thing or two

4720~~~
I called him it after the Southampton away game and some have started to use it here, can't really take a claim to it though as it might coincidence. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4721~~~
He's fine. <a class="username" data-user="82626, @dirkey" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/82626/">@dirkey</a> didn't say that it was literally heart breaking, after all. It's funny, however, seeing as how he was just criticizing someone for using a figure of speech while using one himself. 

Almost literally literal would be a good tagline for him.

4722~~~
I agree, x gets a shite rap on here, literally underrated as feck.

4723~~~
His booking was the most Rafael-like yellow card ever.

4724~~~
Henry wasn't famed for his finishing at a younger age. He was famed for his pace and wing play. I remember he, Victor Ikpeba (spelling?) and Trezeguet at Monaco during the late 90s. They were a real "pace and power" frontline with Ikpeba being the targetman. Henry was very much a Martial in our current setup, playing mostly on the wing, except Henry was more winger than forward. I believe Wenger started to let him drift more central at Arsenal and that's when the goals picked up. Don't remember him as much of a finisher with Monaco and Juventus.

4725~~~
His first time pass for rooney's tap in was excellent. So often the opportunity is lost as they take an extra touch or the pass is just cut out. I know its not the most technically amazing pass but still so often gotten wrong.  

He just has all the basics of a great footballer. He is a natural footballer. He is getting better at picking out people in the box. He doesn't just blindly cross it in,  always looks to find his man.

4726~~~
I haven't felt this much excitement watching a United player pick up a ball since Ronnie was here

4727~~~
HE should have hacked down the ref instead of Bardsley really. He got shoved in the face and ref waved play on for some reason.

4728~~~
Same here. One of the very few attacking players who make you feel excited every time they touch the ball. A true joy to watch.

4729~~~
Another fantastic display from him. Every time he gets the ball and runs at defenders, you just know it'll end with a chance on goal.

I agree that he should play centrally long term, but he looks very good, and productive out on the left.

4730~~~
Martial Manhunter

4731~~~
I think people are misunderstanding my point. I'm talking about his shooting from distance. Martial is a great finisher in front of goal but I've not really seen anything of note from him from distance.

4732~~~
Henry was definitely quicker than Martial. Martial has all the tools to become world class but maybe he will never reach Henry's level.

4733~~~
We played more of a counterattacking game yesterday so he received a lot of balls in space. But what impressed me was that even when the Stoke players doubled up, hey couldn't shop him.

4734~~~
Why would you say that already and why is that so important? Just let him develop nicely and enjoy the show. Dont understand why people always have to compare and say he will never be on this or that level. Who knows, he might surpass Henry, maybe not. I find him brilliant and great to see, it has been a while since someone so young can excite the masses.

4735~~~
It's a figure of speech. Not actually meant to be taken literally.

4736~~~
Worried after Bardsley he might get a lot of the rough stuff

Hope he reacts like Ronaldo did

What a player though... beat Johnson so many times Glen must have thought he was at an S and M weekend

4737~~~
It is harder to get away with these days. Bardsley should have been booked after that terrible challenge near our box and that would have put him effectively out of the game.

The ref was terrible last night in that regard.

4738~~~
Comparisons between exciting young players and previous stars of the game are something quite natural. The post above my post touches on this theme and I stated my opinion. Henry is probably the best forward along with C. Ronaldo the PL has ever seen. We can be happy and excited about Martial's potential even if we compare him to Henry. The very fact that the comparision makes sense speaks volumes.

4739~~~
At age 22 Henry moved to Juventus and flopped. No one really expected him to be as good as he was once he arrived at Arsenal.

I watched him play for Monaco in the CL a number of times too and while he was one of their best players you didn't feel like you were watching the future best player in the world.

4740~~~
Well, Rooney at 18 was probably better than Zidane was at 22. But Zidane went on to become an all time great. I agree that Martial at 20 isn't any worse than Henry at the same age. But this does not mean that he is going to be as good at 26-7 as Henry was at Arsenal. It is too early to tell. At one point Januzaj was compared to Cruyff on here...

4741~~~
It's premature to say he wont reach that or that level. Let's just see. So far, he's been brilliant

4742~~~
I feel that Martial has enough upside in regards to talent to be a top three Ballon D'or. The big question is temperament IMO. Can he produce his best on a consistent basis for a full season and beyond? Can he cope with the pressure of being the best and is he hungry enough for it?

4743~~~
Spot on. He's a very special talent. It remains to be seen whether he will have the character to realise his potential. Maybe he will need also a great manager. SAF helped Ronaldo a lot.

4744~~~
this. a player can have all the potential in this world but still needs a manager who can make him turn potential into success and became a world class player. hope that will be the case with martial at united.

4745~~~
15 goals and 10 assists would be an excellent debut season if he can get there. Just hope we can get him some help sharpish.

4746~~~
We play some minnows in the cups and it is perfectly possible that he achieves these numbers. We need him to deliver more often in the league. He's our best forward and best bet to make top 4.

4747~~~
Yet another goal from the Thierry Henry catalogue.

Just hope he improves his shooting. Yeah, sounds ridiculous after he bent it into the far top corner from 18 yards, but you know what I mean. If he could learn to put his laces through it he could score tons of goals as he so easily makes opportunities for himself just outside the box.

4748~~~
If we had another two him we'd be running away with the title.

4749~~~
Hmmmm <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

4750~~~
My iPad is a mess
They couldn't stop him.

4751~~~
No worries mate. Just messing with u!

4752~~~
There's no limit to his potential, brilliant player in the making! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

4753~~~
Whatever the outcome of this season, his arrival will be a bright spot.

Right now he's looking like a player who has the potential to become one of the very best, and he's already performing at a higher level that anyone could reasonably expect from him at his age. Imagine what we could do in the coming years if we were able to bring in a striker and a right sided attacker with similar potential! We're already one third there, it's possible lads <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4754~~~
To clarify, I'm not addressing your doubt over Martial, I'm addressing Henry's abilities pre-Arsenal when you were too young to remember. Henry was much more a winger than Martial is back then. Trezeguet was Monaco's bigger threat in terms of shooting. It's still early to judge if Martial would actually reach Henry's level, but the thing is not many people expected Henry to end up in the 'forward' position that he did at Arsenal.

4755~~~
Only because of age. You need to lower the hype. Messi is possibly the greatest of all time who doubles the scoring record of all time great strikers, while at the same time possessing vision that rivals the best passers ever. Martial is just starting and his ability doesn't reach that of Messi's. There is no reason to be setting the bar that high. 

In any case, Martial is a joy to watch. Still not sure where I would like for him to end up on the pitch.

4756~~~
I have watched his goal for the 89th time this morning, true class.

4757~~~
You just know/expect something is going to happen when he has the ball, top top talent.

4758~~~
His finishing will improve but his close control is better than Henry's or pretty much every other player (bar Messi and maybe Suarez). I just can't get over the fact that his technique on the ball, running in between defenders is quite often executed perfectly <b>at pace</b>. 

Absolute bargain.

4759~~~
Every time he's one on one with a defender, I expect him to go past his man. It's sad it's the complete opposite feeling I have with Memphis.

4760~~~
Any team with three Martials up front is going to win the league

4761~~~
Louis van Gaal has admitted that even he is “surprised” by the immediate impact Anthony Martial has had at Manchester United.

The French forward has emerged as <b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.football365.com/news/martial-man-uniteds-accidental-main-man" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">United’s accidental main man</a></b> since joining from Ligue Un side Monaco in the summer.

Martial became the most expensive teenager in history after United signed him for £36.7million on transfer deadline day in the summer, with the 19-year-old expected to integrated slowly into the first team.

But the 20-year-old has scored nine goals in 29 games at the club, becoming their second-top goalscorer this season behind captain Wayne Rooney.

Manager Van Gaal admits that even he has found Martial’s immediate impact “very much surprising”, with the striker having scored against Stoke on Tuesday.

<b>“You come from the French league, come to the Premier League and you do this at 20 then you have a lot of potential to give but then I am the manager not any more at that time when he is at his best,”</b> Van Gaal said.

Martial impressed again as a wide forward at Old Trafford against Stoke, with chances in his favoured central position few and far between for the French international so far.

<b>“That [starting centrally] is dependent on the shape of the team, his fellow players,” Van Gaal added. “He likes to play in a striker’s position more than where he is now playing but when I need him to play on the other side. When he plays like this I am not changing. Same as Rooney, same as Mata. I am not changing.

“They were team goals and team goals I love the most – superb, superb. I’m also happy with individual goals but these were a team. The finishing was also very good.”
</b>

Big hint there that he will not be sticking around

4762~~~
You are as bad as Neil Custis. Martial will be coming into his prime around 25 years of age. Of course he isn't sticking around for another five years, a true nothing comment.

4763~~~
Of course he isn't going to be here in five or six seasons.

4764~~~
Yeah, Martial will only be 21/22 should Vangle see out his contract. Long way from his peak.

4765~~~
We can only hope Martial is here at his peak, potential club legend

4766~~~
Is it just me or does Martial look so much like the guy who played Dre in Straight Outta Compton?

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a13/hannahlikesdogs/14D8C879A5104D8C9D8F70C7DBED9B18.ashx.jpg" src="http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a13/hannahlikesdogs/14D8C879A5104D8C9D8F70C7DBED9B18.ashx.jpg"/> <img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a13/hannahlikesdogs/kong-skull-island-corey-hawkins.jpg" src="http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a13/hannahlikesdogs/kong-skull-island-corey-hawkins.jpg"/> 

Seriously they actually do look pretty similar, he reminded me of Martial the whole movie... <span style="color: #ffffff">inb4 people call "OH ALL BLACK PEOPLE LOOK THE SAME DO THEY???" on me....</span>

4767~~~
He reminds me more of that Noah guy in the Walking Dead.

4768~~~
I hope he has a field day against Ivanovich. The latter hasn't been solid this season.

4769~~~
It was so well taken. His first touch to bring down Rooney's pass was world class, and the way he just nonchalantly steps into the shop and just whips it makes him look like a seasoned player. 

And he <i>just</i> turned 20! Simply incredible.

4770~~~
Should be a bloodbath.

4771~~~
Nah, that's Danny Welbeck.

4772~~~
Signing him is one of the brightest spots of the LVG's tenure at OT.

4773~~~
Yep simply stunning, imagine how good thus kid could become.

4774~~~
I second this

Martial's dribbling technique is superior to Henry's in my opinion aswel. As for the pace argument it's too early to tell.

4775~~~
He didn't have a bad game but I was disappointed in how little he got at Ivanovic, I thought he'd be running at him more frequently.

4776~~~
Playing close to every single game may be having an effect on him.

4777~~~
Not sure why he didn't try and go on the outside today, pretty much every dribble he did was cutting in.

Was unlucky not to score from a great save from cortious but apart from that was fairly quiet.

4778~~~
Thought ivanovic simply reads the game pretty well and decided to show up for a day. Was pretty tight on him too.

4779~~~
Great shot in the first half, but after that Chelsea knew he would go on the inside and managed to tackle him.

4780~~~
True he was, but at times he had him turned and back peddling, just never chose to go outside. Thought he would have wanted to test his pace but he never really for him running

4781~~~
Imo looked tired.

4782~~~
Did well in the first half, nothing really in the second. Ivanovic stuck tight to him and Willian covered well to not give him much space. Still had a few very good moments where he could've scored though.

4783~~~
Agreed and they were constantly doubling yp on him. 
If Rooney had crossed instead of going for the stupid chip, he would've had a goal.

4784~~~
Most keepers in the league wouldn't have saved his shot in the first half.

4785~~~
Was unlucky not to score. Courtois did brilliantly to save his first half effort and Martial did very well to create enough space for his second half chance, but really should have gone for the far corner.

4786~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/z8i9" width="560"></iframe>

4787~~~
Our best player along with DDG

4788~~~
He is our future. He will probably be the worlds best player.

4789~~~
Some people continue to insist he can't shoot.

There's only a handful of keepers in the league who save that.

4790~~~
Wouldn't say Ivanovic had his number in that game. Chelsea were set up to defend against him, doubling up every opportunity. Mikel wouldn't have played the whole game if it weren't for Martial. More and more teams will start to do this as there are very few right backs who can live with Martial. Shame we cannot capitalize with another of his ilk on the other wing.

4791~~~
They doubled on him all game, yet he still created two very good chances for himself. Shows just how good the guy is.

4792~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/10162164/anthony-martial-says-patrice-evra-played-key-role-in-man-united-move" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.skysports.com/football/n...trice-evra-played-key-role-in-man-united-move</a>

God I fecking love Paddy.

4793~~~
He can curl the ball pretty well, which is great when shooting after cutting in from the left wing. 

When playing centrally, the striker should be able to smash the ball in as well from distance, which Martial hasn't shown an ability to do so far.

4794~~~
We should've done all to keep him and Vidic just for the dressing room.

4795~~~
Is it possible not to?

4796~~~
The strike against Chelsea wasn't a curler, though you're right he hasn't shown it centrally so far.

I think he was a bit too hesitant in terms of shooting from distance until a few weeks ago. Maybe I'm imagining things, but he's started shooting more often and the shot against Chelsea was the latest example. The only way he'd improve his shooting technique from long distance is by actually shooting, so long may it continue.

4797~~~
Wonder if he can do the same with Pogba, despite him already being at the club?

4798~~~
I would honestly be surprised if he hasn't been tapping him up since the day he landed.

4799~~~
Patrice Evra is a fecking hero.

4800~~~
Noticed that as well when I was watching it.

4801~~~
Watched a YT video of his debut vs Liverpool earlier. Goosebumps when he starts to accelerate AT Skrtel, you just knew it was going to happen.

4802~~~
People thought it was lucky at the time too. He does it nearly every game now, no matter the opponent.

4803~~~

4804~~~
He made Coleman and Ricardo Rodriguez look like average fullbacks at the age of 19 man.

4805~~~
Not surprising. Someone once said he has magic in his feet. Couldn't be more apt.

4806~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://i.gyazo.com/d1c41dc8eee656a06de0c2de09666577.png" src="https://i.gyazo.com/d1c41dc8eee656a06de0c2de09666577.png"/> 
In good company with the best of his age group, despite being overburdened and double-marked most of the time.

4807~~~
Thank you for the compliment. It was me.

4808~~~
Love his talent. Physically and technically he has everything you need. He can strike the ball, he is fast, beats players of fun, he's strong and agile. How far he goes depends on the mental side of his game. Right now for me his game lacks the goal hunger of a player who will be a a truly prolific scorer and in front of goal he is a poor finisher and tends to make the wrong decision or strike the ball incorrect more often than not. Despite this in his first season i England in an attack as poor as ours and mainly playing wide he has scored at a 1 in 3 rate. That will be solid for a first season if he can maintain it.

4809~~~
I know this had been said a lot of times before but that finish is ice cool.

4810~~~
Delightful finish. So composed. Yedlin isn't the easiest match up for him, as he is lightning quick, but he's still finding ways to make his quality shine through.

4811~~~
Not really worth stating it anymore - he's class, end of.

Looks in another league (aside from Mata when used correctly) to his fellow front players.

4812~~~
Beautiful finish.

4813~~~
Once again he's up against at least two Sunderland players all the time, yet scored a goal and is our most dangerous played along with Mata.

4814~~~
Thank feck we have him. Imagine if we hadn't bought him <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>.

4815~~~
The Black Pele.

4816~~~
Our ray of sunshine! The only attacker we have that can dribble and beat a man on a regular basis.

4817~~~
Disappeared once LvG put Depay in his position and shifted him to the right.

4818~~~
Only player capable of beating a man, Yedlin on a fecking yellow and this moron throws him on the right wing in order to accomodate poor le cut inside man. Another piece of inexplicable shit.

4819~~~
Only positive thing so far this season. He's by far our best player but somehow LvG felt the need to switch him out of his best position to make room for Mempiss.

4820~~~
Never would have imagined he'd have such an impact for us. He's our best outfield player.

Shoving him out on the right was absolutely absurd though.

4821~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4822~~~
It pissed me off no  end. It's so fecking dumb that you'd think people like LVG wouldn't even think of doing it.

4823~~~
By far our best attacker on the field.

I really hope we are getting him better team mates next season, if he has to play much longer with this shower of shite he might decide that following in CR's footsteps looks like a great idea.

4824~~~
Good first half topped off with a classy finish, I felt he fizzled out in the second half though and then we stupidly switched him to the RW. Truth is though I feel we are too reliant on him to always be the one to run at defenses, we need someone on the right to share the responsibility and switch things up.

4825~~~
Don't understand why he needs to move to accommodate Depay

4826~~~
Don't understand why he needs to move to accommodate Rooney who doesn't offer either hold up play or pace up front.

4827~~~
Very nice.




Gutted as I am Martial deserves all the love, his goal was a perfect understated piece of absolute class.

4828~~~
Imagine if we didnt sign him though. We were close to going into the season without him

4829~~~
This and the de Gea to Madrid debacle. We were so so close to being even more shite than we are now.

4830~~~
Completely brainless decision. If you're bringing on Memphis, who should get the priority of playing in their preferred wing position - Martial or Memphis? It's clear as day. LVG needs to realize that Martial is his main man right now, and not someone to be shunted around.

To make things worse, Martial, as natural a footballer as he is, always looks a bit awkward on the right.

4831~~~
If those two scenarios had occurred we might actually have been fighting relegation right now.

4832~~~
Was moved to the right in order to accommodate a clearly inferior player after scoring in the first half <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Let's move our best player on the right to play with a complete rookie of a rightback when we ''chase'' a win. Genius!

4833~~~
Yup, doesn't seem comfortable there at all as be has to cut in on his weaker foot. He was easily the best player in the first half so obviously, we had to do the sensible thing and marginalise him for the rest of the game.

4834~~~
Does he have a right footed brother we can sign?

4835~~~
Complete joke that he was moved to the right hand side to accommodate Depay. We'd look a far worse team without this guy around.

4836~~~
I wonder sometimes what kind of road his development would take in a great attacking team. Like in the place of Sterling with Suarez and Sturridge in that 13-14 team. Or in a three with Vardy and Mahrez from the first half of this season's Leicester.

4837~~~
I hope Martial doesn't start wondering himself

4838~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> ...<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

4839~~~
he must be starting to regret his decision at this rate.....

4840~~~
He'll probably start if we don't sort this shit out in the summer.

4841~~~
Why? At the very least he's launched himself onto the world stage. It's not a great time for the club but its great for his career right now, a year ago barely anybody knew about him or thought he was special since coming to United he has become one of the best young players in the world.

4842~~~
Brilliant finish. Decision to shift him for Depay was idiotic.

4843~~~
I don't have a problem with him being moved over to the right to bring Depay on. It was worth a try.

However, when it became obvious Martial had been absolutely invisible since he'd been moved over, LVG should have changed things around further to get him either into the centre or back to the left.

4844~~~
If he wants to follow in the footsteps of people like Ronaldo, Robben and Bale then he should learn to play both sides and continue to score goals. At the moment he is much better on the left.

4845~~~
Sunderland was not the occasion to experiment with moving Martial to the right. 

In the pantheon of moronic in-game decisions by LVG, this one may top the cake.  Martial was schooling Yedlin, more looked certain tom come but then LVG put the boot on Martial's neck and he instantly went into witness protection.

4846~~~
Poor Anthony Martial. Always winning MoTM 'cause everyone else is shite.

4847~~~
This is van Gaal. Martial does well on the left so it's obvious he needs to move him to his right to show his absolute genius of making bold decisions.

4848~~~
He has moved Martial to the right to accommodate Memphis a few times this season. 

Memphis should be the one moved around, if anything. Martial is playing well on the left and Memphis is the one with a point to prove.

4849~~~
Memphis should not be moved around and he shouldn't be put on the field when we are not dominating, LVG is being extremely stupid there.

4850~~~
If we can't bring on a 27m signing to change a game then something is wrong.

4851~~~
I agree, but if it's a choice between moving one of Memphis or Martial, it should be Memphis.

4852~~~
There is no choice to make though, Memphis shouldn't even play wide. In my opinion he should come in as a striker next to Rooney and when he does we should play in 442.

4853~~~
You just said you don't think he should be moved around and now you're saying you'd want to see him used as a striker?

Anyway, my point was more about getting the best out of Martial (who is actually delivering) and less about Memphis.

4854~~~
Moved around means that we move him depending of the situation, right? I'm saying that he should only play upfront, that's where he played his only good game.

4855~~~
I meant it in relation to him being used out of position. 

Fair enough, though I doubt it'd make much difference. He's also had a couple of good games in the Champions League from the left and hasn't kicked on, I think he's just shot of confidence.

4856~~~
We need him on the left. Everything good about this side goes through him. We'll create bog all if he plays up front.

Bring back Wilson, give Keane a chance or play lazy Depay up front so he hasn't got as much responsibility going backwards.

4857~~~
I hate this bullshit notion of 'not enough contact for a penalty'. He's running at speed, not to mention shifting his weight due to moving the ball and rolling his foot over it, it doesn't take an awful lot to knock you off balance in that situation, yet these 'experts' seem to think unless you're kicked full on in the knee it's 'not enough'.

4858~~~
I think Europe's top clubs may target Martial in the summer - he's been one a very few bright spots in our season. Deserves to be playing Champions League football as well.

4859~~~
He's going no where.

We spent a stupid amount of money on him. No ones going to come close to offering what it would take us to sell.

4860~~~
That's the spirit.

4861~~~
Feel sorry for him, deserves so much better. And he'd be the perfect Arsenal-Wenger striker (Well after Sturridge).

4862~~~
How long till he leaves?

4863~~~
He gets a pass for that display.

4864~~~
He completely disappeared in the last 30. But then our whole attack did. If you can call it an attack.

4865~~~
He has the money going for him, will easily get Rooney wages if he maintains his performances and then starts flirting with Real in a few years

4866~~~
I feel for him.

4867~~~
He started brightly, some lovely footwork on more than one occasion, but at times he seemed to be the only one really up for it up top and he faded in the second half.

4868~~~
I think we've got one more year of him.  Similar results to this and he'll be off imo. I'd wish him all the best.. deserves to be recognised as one of the world's greatest young players and competing against the best.. not this shite.

4869~~~
Its embarrassing how completely reliant we are on him.

4870~~~
How many matches has he played this season? We are way over-using him because we have less-than-zero other options.

4871~~~
He had to rely on McNair's hoof balls all game <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4872~~~
Him and de Gea the only two I feel sorry for.

4873~~~
We can't afford to rest him even against shit teams. Pathetic. He has played too many games, won't be surprised if he picks up an injury or gets knackered in the last months of the season.

4874~~~
It really is, hes not got much help and to think he was deemed a "late panic buy", Sad thing is , this and the FA cup games should be ones we should be resting him in but were so shit ourselves and with options, we cant do that.

4875~~~
And Luke Shaw.

All three will be gone soon if we don't buck up.

4876~~~
I'm just waiting till he gets injured

4877~~~
His face waiting for the kick off after their second goal... If he gets fed another year of this bs he will leave.

4878~~~
Bloody hell. its not like we signed him from Barcalona and this is a huge step down for him.
He was playing at Monaco... who got knocked out of the CL qualifiers and then got knocked out of the Europa League group stages.

This is still a step up for him.

Obviously, he'll want CL football as most top players do.. but people dont have to worry about him being too upset and leaving anytime soon.

4879~~~
I feel his best position for us is the LW, he's far more involved, that makes him more of a threat and more influential. Playing up in strike yesterday he didn't have much of the ball and was meh. He's got all the talent and I do feel it would be best if he continued on the left where he cut in or dribble down the line, come in the box for crosses and he does his bit defensively. I'd rather Memphis play upfront than Martial right now, if it ain't broke don't fix it type thing. Get Januzaj back fit or bring Wilson back off loan. I don't want to see anymore of Lingard. After Matas and Herreras preformance I'd give Pereira more game time.

..................Memphis..................
Martial........Pereira.......Januzaj

Or

....................AJ/MD....................
Martial........Pereira.........Wilson

4880~~~
Obviously a huge talent but sometimes I wish he looked a bit hungrier, when the ball was bouncing around the box yesterday I was looking at him and he was just standing there looking motionless - ball watching.

If he can add that poacher instinct, like Hernandez is in the box, looking to sniff out any chance that might fall his way he could be a lethal forward. Also would like to see more aggression from him, like Ronaldo when he was developing into a world class player - you could tell he wanted it so badly and was just a winner that wasn't going to fail, I get they are 2 different people but it is concerning how it looks like he doesn't give a sh*t sometimes. Hoping next season he will be more selfish and look to get more shots away and be disappointed if he doesn't score in every game he plays, he can beat his man so effortlessly and work himself into some great shooting positions but seems to try too much or look to pass when he should just let fly.

I know that seems harsh and I'm asking a lot for someone that's new to the league and just turned 20 years old but that is the level I see him at - he could be the next superstar if we develop him right.

4881~~~
I agree with you. His natural talent is fantastic but he needs that extra raw mentality IMO, that Suarez-esque thunder and hunger.

4882~~~
In fairness, he is French

4883~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/b5wp/2015/138/en/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/sites/b5wp/2015/138/en/</a>

Most fielded U21 across the big leagues.

Carrying our attack too ffs.

4884~~~
So were Cantona and Evra... I like Martial's coolness.

4885~~~
Only for forwards though, Bellerin, Sule, Tah and Romagnoli(barely) have a higher percentage.

4886~~~
Ha yeah, was just kidding. I've played enough football in France to know they're not all  Laurent Robert!

But yeah I quite like it too, I loved Rooney's fire too at that age but Martial is so cold blooded it's brilliant!

4887~~~
He's defended excellently tonight.

4888~~~
Don't get why he doesn't get rested or subbed. We have no other strikers

4889~~~
Should have had a goal.

4890~~~
LvG needs him to save his ass so he will work him like a horse. Starting to affect the young kid.

4891~~~
Top defensive header on that free kick, well in Tony.

4892~~~
Sometimes I think that Martial would be better on the left as a wide forward in a front of 3. Or do you think we will have a better career for us as striker?

4893~~~
Even when he doesn't have his best game he still has moments and works hard for us without the ball.

Right now he's a better dribbler than he is a finisher, so LWF is the best role for him once we get in a new #9.

4894~~~
Yeah I prefer him on the left too. Would love to see how he does with a top striker up front.

4895~~~
In the future I wonder if his best position would be as a striker playing right at the top or playing behind a more physical striker ( who keeps the opposition defenders busy)

Martial dribbling at already busy defenders could be quite a prospect ( a more attacking version of Oscar behind Costa)

4896~~~
Played every single game this season, no wonder he got injured. Well done, LVG.

4897~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I can't do anything but laugh anymore.

4898~~~
FFS.. We'll be lucky to avoid a thrashing vs Arsenal if the injuries keep piling up like this.

4899~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Seriously?

4900~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Suspected hamstring injury. Our league season is on the brink of being over (still hopeful of us getting through tonight). Need others to really step up big time.

4901~~~
To be honest, what difference does it make at this stage. We're not winning a trophy or finishing in the top 4 with or without him. The season's been over since Christmas.

4902~~~
ffs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4903~~~
FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECK.

4904~~~
Is it not true? It's obviously why he got injured.

4905~~~
My big concern is Arsenal. If he's injured for that and DDG is still out, we could be absolutely crushed again

4906~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Injured in the warm up. 

You can't make it up.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

4907~~~
Wondered what was going on then when I saw Rashford lined up!

This season is doomed.

4908~~~
Yep our season is fecked.

4909~~~
If it really is hamstring then he's out for sure. Hoping it's a small knock.

4910~~~
The law of Murphy strikes again!

4911~~~
rucking hell, it just gets worse and worse

WHO knew that relying on 2 strikers, one a very young guy in a new league for a whole season could be disastrous?

Oh that's right, everyone!!

4912~~~
This is what happens when you tell a teenager he's not horny enough.

4913~~~
if we line up v Arsenal, without De Gea, fullbacks, Smalling, Schweiny, Rooney and Martial, we could really take a pasting here.

4914~~~
Beyond caring this is silly now.

4915~~~
He was the only positive from this season.....aaaannnd he's gone.

4916~~~
Pulled his banjo string.

4917~~~
#PrayForMartial

4918~~~
Don't want him rushed back, making things worse. 

Hope he is back when he's good and ready, and fit to play.

4919~~~
Good link, thanks for that.

4920~~~
Good thing is that he actually he gets some rest now, I guess.

4921~~~
Was to be expected, tbf. LvG's relied too much on him.

4922~~~
David May just called it on MUTV lvg keeps banging on about the red zone players surely Martial had to be in it he's played near enough every game.

4923~~~
Obviously... <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

4924~~~
i mean you can blame LVG but hes our best player of course hes going to play, injuries happen at all ages lets just put up with it.

4925~~~
Dutch commentator saying Martial has been taken out because of precaution because of Arsenal game coming up?!

4926~~~
Hope so because well need him.

4927~~~
He was a bit quiet tonight.

4928~~~
Van Gaal on Martial: "It's a tight hamstring. He was very wise to step out, it's not a rupture - I don't think it's too heavy."

4929~~~
Yep seems in line to what the commentator on my chAnnel said, a precaution because arsenal is coming up.

4930~~~
From the official site on Martial:

"It should be his first muscle injury [since arriving at the club]," he told <i>BT Sport</i>. "But he is smart and wise to step out. It is not a rupture or anything like that. A tight hamstring. I don't think it is very heavy."

The manager elaborated further at his press conference: "Anthony can be tired. He's only 20 and he's played all the matches so it's not so remarkable. He stepped down himself and that I like very much. 

"I have already explained to you the only muscle injury we have is Marouane Fellaini. That we know already when he played so many matches in a row. It's always like that when you don't have other players and it's difficult to change or rotate. So the next muscle injury would be [expected to be] Martial but I don't think he has a muscle injury. He is very intelligent - he steps down when his hamstring is tight.

"You have to cope with that, it's difficult also for the team because, after David De Gea, now Martial, and Martial and De Gea have played very good seasons, I think, and they have to be replaced."

Nonetheless, everybody will be eagerly waiting to see if Martial will be available for Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Arsenal at Old Trafford.
-----

Wouldn't be surprised to see him start sunday.  He seems desperate, repeating that it's not a muscle injury several times.

4931~~~
At least the kid is smart to put his fitness over a game. He'll start Sunday.

4932~~~
I'd say it's a very good quality to have, to know when you can't play. Smart decision although if he had pulled out and then we lost I think everyone would be a little bit pissed off

4933~~~
Not really. It's not like he threw a hissy and insisted on being left out. He told the physio what he was feeling and they decided not to play him. He looked respectably annoyed about it. We don't want players lying about their fitness to the management. As you say, he did the smart thing.

4934~~~
But one must come to the conclusion that surely if we had some players in the squad to play we'd have said "don't worry about your hammy Tony, sit this one and have a rest lad" and not the other bloody way around, christ on a bike.

4935~~~
Should we expect him back for Sunday? Or would a 'tight hamstring' take longer?

4936~~~
For those that missed Louis' brief update...

4937~~~
Hope he isn't shafted to the right in favor of Memphis or Rashford. He is the biggest talent among them and needs to be developed and made use of in the best possible way.

4938~~~
If Rashford doesn't score next game he'll be the one of the bench. Martial will go back upfront.

It'll be more interesting to see what happens when Rooneh is fit.

4939~~~
I still don't get why Rashford can't be moved out right

4940~~~
Not a problem as finally we'll have a potentially game changing forward on the bench.  We have struggled this year for attacking options in the last third of the game.  Am delighted if Rashford can excel in that role for now.

4941~~~
Baffling to see our best and most talented player shunted to the right (where he has been shite every time) with 2-match heroes occupying his most effective two positions.

4942~~~
I don't think he is any better than Lingard on the right. Seriously don't understand why we play him on the right from time to time, he is our best attacking player both on the left and as a striker but he is always pointless on the right.

4943~~~
Stupid manager. So stupidly stupid that hes playing on the right.

4944~~~
There are a few who advocated for Rashford and Memphis in his positions and Martial to the right. 

Tells you alot about redcafe.

4945~~~
Our best player over the last 6 months gets shunted to the right for the best players over the last 180 minutes. Its fecking stupid.

Plus Rashford offers very little build up. And Memphis kinda sucks today.

4946~~~
Brilliant run to win the free-kick. Any GIFs, <a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a>?

4947~~~
I'll do gifs later  no time atm

4948~~~
Cheers. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

4949~~~
Put him in the middle and he does something, and a goal comes from it. WHo knew.

4950~~~
Should never be played on the right.

4951~~~
He was shit tonight, but still won the winning freekick with a great run.

4952~~~
Just dont understand why he cant do at least basic things on the right like he does on the left. There was a 2nd ball of him dropping to Ander and you could see miles away that Ander gonna pass into space,he just stood there...

4953~~~
And he will have many more shit nights if he continues playing on the right.

4954~~~
Play him central or on the left.

Adjust the others.

4955~~~
This. He really dont like the right.

4956~~~
Terrible header from Herrera's cross early on and didn't improve much until that nice piece of skill and run late on that resulted in the free-kick from which Mata scored.

4957~~~
Crap on the right but still had some nice link play and a run that won us the freekick.

4958~~~
He was rubbish truth be said. Move someone else around. He's our best player. Play him in his favoured position.

4959~~~
Play him up top. Knew from the beginning that RW was a bad choice for him. Even though he had a game to forget, did win us the freekick from which we scored - so all good <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

4960~~~
I think he's capable of better performances on the right, but the fact he just returned from an injury and Watford's physicality didn't allow him to show more on the wing.

He was better centrally (which can be expected), but still didn't really get enough chances to make a mark in the game (maybe apart from that poor header in the first half). Did very well to win us that free kick, though. His close control is something else.

4961~~~
Completely invisible on the right, instantly improved up front. Should never play on the right wing, he doesn't seem to know what to do as he's pretty one footed and so becomes predictable.

4962~~~
Was ridiculous we didnt shift Memphis and Martial in the first half when it wasnt working out for either. Expecting it to just... work was strange philosophy.

He should never ever play on the right again.

4963~~~
So this rules out playing him on the right, which at least reduces the dilemma to two positions. Both he and Rashford looked infinitely better once they'd swapped. Worth noting that if he hadn't been fouled (winning the free kick which Mata scored) he was clean through, and would most likely have scored. It was his most incisive bit of play in the match, so it's a shame he didn't get to finish it off himself.

4964~~~
He hates it on the right. He had a right strop with our coach at Sunderland away because they told him to swap to the right. He doesn't look interested when asked to play out there.

4965~~~
Definitely seemed pissed off and uninterested all game. Just can't seem to do it out there. No reason to play him there anyway, on the left or up top, he shouldn't be pushed to the right for lesser players.

4966~~~
Its not that. When Rashford was in form, its not right to move him or bench him. I think Martial should have come off the bench tonight given he was doing from injury and we have tough away games coming up.

4967~~~
Memphis and Rasher were in form so it wasnt the worst of decisions to shoehorn him into the lineup from the right but he was just ineffective today, nextime maybe rashford from the right and martial up front or depay from the right, rashford up front and martial from the left...

His dribble through the middle was amazing though, he just has the ball glued to his feet, recalled that "football on cord" I always wanted, offered every morning on teleshopping..

4968~~~
Lets just call a spade a spade, he was bad.  playing some weird tactic of all de geas kicks going towards him but he was winning nothing. His touch was off and his dribbling was poor for the most part aside from earning the free kick. If he was on the left or up top it would have been the same, sometimes players just have shit games and this was one for martial today. Didn't get a chance to play himself into the game because the ball spent an absurd amount of time with our defenders and not enough with out attackers tonight.

4969~~~
Can't play on the right, but you can understand why LvG put him there, just didn't work. Let's not forget he just got back from an injury, we don't know how much he has been training for.

4970~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/ibq3" width="560"></iframe>

4971~~~
Rashford did ever so well to win that ball so Martial could counter.

4972~~~
Not his greatest day but still exciting to think about what the future holds for these young talented players working together.

4973~~~
He can do better. The match was a great learning experience for him. You got to see instances of his tackling ability. He's going to be a beast in a few years.

edit: I was wondering where my TFM comment went. My mistake. I had 2 tabs open at the time and mistakenly commented in Martial's thread.

4974~~~
He's just a poor player on the right ATM. Every time he plays there he seems confused as to what to do and all his natural instincts disappear. I don't think we should play him there till he shows some signs of comfort on that side (if he does at all).

Having said that, lovely play to win the freekick that we scored from.

4975~~~
I thought it was a dive to be honest...
Very good dive as he was losing the ball.

4976~~~
I just don't see his best position as a striker leading the line.  

If there was a striker holding the two central defenders then martial could dribble in to the space he chooses much like Kaka used to do behind Crespo at Milan. 

Him leading the line means it takes something really special to get past players & even though we have seen that alot of times,  relying on that means his influence is felt less. 

Not much we can do in the near future tbh.  He leads the line better than mata does playing on the right.  Eventually though..

4977~~~
Didn't have his best game but not every player plays at their best every single game.

Even not at his best still drove forward and took players on and beat 3 players to win the free kick to get the winner so... not a bad day at the office by far.

4978~~~
It seems to me his best position by far is left wing, although I think he will evolve into a centre forward over time. At the moment he seems wasted in the middle.

He especially seems like half the player on the right, however I think part of this is fatigue. He looks like he could do with a bit of a break. Give Pereira/Januzaj a chance if we need to rest Lingard.

4979~~~
Would be a treat if Memphis and Martial build enough of an understanding to frequently interchange positions during the game. Both seem comfortable as an LW & CF, actually really rate Memphis's holdup ability.

4980~~~
some very good pieces of play before the freekick, Varela playing it constructively - Darmian would most certainly clear the ball, nic steal from Rashford afterwards and fantastic dribble from Anthony..

4981~~~
Looking at he replay he didn't intend to go past the final tackle.

4982~~~
We need him back in form.

4983~~~
Did not know it was a dive. Is this the freekick for the goal?

4984~~~
Seems to be me that it was both a dive and a foul. The defender went to ground and impeded play without getting the ball, but Martial wasn't touched and took a tumble.

4985~~~
Exceeded all expectations for me very glad to have him here. Hopefully Depay and Rashford come good and if we buy another forward of real class we should have an exciting front line.

4986~~~
Agreed. Add Lukaku and we're very well placed for years to come with a great blend of speed, power and skill. Goals from every department with that lot.

4987~~~
Thats because it wasn't.

It was a shit tackle.

4988~~~
He is coming to life in the second half

4989~~~
Cant do much when Rojo and Blind do nothing but hoof it to West Brom's center backs

4990~~~
Has been useless after the injury... Why did he came back in the team when the team was finally doing well? Same with Darmian.

4991~~~
Had some good moments but he had no service.

4992~~~
Fairly ineffectual for a while now, mostly because he has to run it 40yards or magic something out of nothing.

4993~~~
Expected that from him. Didnt really look interested. Cant really blame him.

4994~~~
He was our best player in the second half by a fecking mile. What the feck was he supposed to do with the abysmal hoofballs from that waste of space Blind?

4995~~~
Utter nonsense. He was the only one controlling the ball with three men up his arse and holding it up. There were two sequences when he kept their entire backline busy by himself with a 100 mph no-hoper hoofed up in his general direction. Won us a few freekicks with good dribbling and alot of neat little touches as well to keep possession, but nothing apart from a sideways pass available to him so what can he do? 

Wtf have you been watching? Some people need to take up another hobby.

4996~~~
Though he looked our best player after Smalling.

4997~~~
Had 0 interest in the game today.

I have said it before in this thread but he really needs to discover some hunger and needs to adjust his attitude if he wants to be one of the best in the world - would like to see him with a win at all cost attitude, the guys that just cant take losing like Ronaldo/Suarez - that drive is what is lacking in his game and in my opinion is holding him back. Martial must be so easy to defend against at time as if the balls not near him he doesn't care, players like Kane/Vardy would run everything down win throw ins high up the pitch and not let a team play out so easily against us and when down to 10 men that's exactly what we needed not a disinterested walk around and not give a feck performance.

4998~~~
Ran the ball well with no support most of the time, but he needs to move more after he parts with it, he's not taking up good enough positions in the next phase right now.

4999~~~
If he zero interest he wouldn't be tracking back with Craig Dawson or trying to make something happen in the final third with two sometimes three people on top of him.

5000~~~
Looked the only one out there likely to make anything happen. He must be wondering what the feck he has done coming here when the players around him are incapable of playing on his wavelength. 

Would be hugely suited to playing in the Barca team.

5001~~~
Not sure why he's getting criticized. He looked a cut above everyone else on the field. Not easy when Rojo barely supports him with an overlap and with Blind just hoofing it to him with 2 defenders on his back. He was the only player who probed for us in the 2nd half. Had no support from anyone.

5002~~~
Holy shit is he getting criticised for that awesome display as an isolated forward? He was literally our only outlet and tried to win it single-handedly.

5003~~~
Go to the United without Rooney and Martial thread. Latest post askig the question if he is too unpredictable for his teammates and thus making good teamwork harder. Shocking.

I swear some want ten Valencias playing for us, all the predictability we want.

5004~~~
His hold-up play, at age 20, is comparable to (though not as good as) Berba and RvP in their prime, and he has tons of pace too. And dribbling. I can't give him much more praise.

5005~~~
This place is astonishing at times.

5006~~~
Was poor to begin with but got a lot better. Cannot really blame him too much as he is still coming back from an injury, had no support from Rojo who should not be playing LB and we were also down to 10 men. Was our only real outlet in the second half.

He'll be even better when he has Shaw behind him, we have a proper striker in the middle and when we no longer philosophy.

5007~~~
He'll score a goal or set someone up vs Liverpool and it's happy days again. Terrible posters on he caf.

5008~~~
One of his issues is that he's an actual footballer who can dribble past people, control a ball whilst being marked, turn on the ball, lift his feet quickly...

It's all too much for his heavy-footed clogger 'trudging in mud' 'can't even turn faster than a snail without a football at their feet, let alone with one' team-mates. He needs actual proper footballers with him.
Players who are good enough with a football that they can actually fathom other players being able to control a quick, zippy pass and attempt it.

5009~~~
He's our best player, and by some distance (bar De Gea).

5010~~~
I fear someone might just snatch him from us.

5011~~~
I would hope we have a huge buy-out clause on him, I fear though we will still be shit in about 2 seasons and he will be a very hot property if he continues on the same trajectory.

5012~~~
I think Shaw is slightly better.

5013~~~
Probably the best young talent in the world, but he still has a lot to learn. His off the ball movement is really poor, I think that's the main reason why he sometimes does better when he plays on the wing.

5014~~~
Shaw had a few good games at the start of this season, he couldn't get in the side last. I agree he's a top talent but Martial is Balon d'Or level potential. 

Madrid will be out for him in a few years to replace Benzema.

5015~~~
To be fair we don't know a level that Shaw is on right now. Hopefully this injury will just be a slight break in his development and not a serious issue but we can't assume that he will return to us as good as he was in August - September.

5016~~~
At half time I'll admit I was questioning him as well, he looked disinterested and generally a bit sulky

Second half he was a lot better and everything positive he did he pretty much did on his own

5017~~~
Pretty much. He had 0 support.

5018~~~
Got my motm award; he's one of the few things that definitely aren't wrong with us.

5019~~~
I meant at the moment. Martial has more potential and plays a more crucial position. 

But right now, I think Shaw, if healthy, is a bit more productive. Martial looks great out there, but he's got 3 goals in 17 starts up top. You can only be so good as a 9 with those kinds of numbers. 4G + 2A in 10 starts is pretty damn solid, though. That's basically the rate Sanchez produced last year from the wing, and quite tough to do. 

So, to give you an idea of where I'm coming from I'd say Shaw is like an 8.5 at LB and Martial is an 8 at LW and a 7 as a lone striker.

5020~~~
So, when he's supposed to start giving a feck about this game? Wtf is happening, is he playing injured or what?

5021~~~
We can't get in their half and when we do the ball is either hoofed his direction or he's up there on his own.. what do you want him to do ffs?

5022~~~
To run maybe? To press?

Criticsm has nothing to do with his on ball quality, he can hardly do anything at all, but he is standing most of the time like he is injured.

5023~~~
Woeful recently.

5024~~~
Did we get too excited too quickly?

5025~~~
Philosophised

5026~~~
How is he meant to be playing well when Memphis next to him aint doing shit for him?

Everything decent we have done going forward has been with Martial getting on the ball.

He should play wide until we have a suitable wide player.

5027~~~
He is not providing with an outlet at all. Very poor half. We should switch Rashford and Martial.

5028~~~
Swap him with Rashford

5029~~~
He did it all by himself earlier in the season so it's quite strange how he has been playing.

5030~~~
I didn't bump the thread for people to criticise him only because he showed nothing because he obviously can't do everything alone, but I am surprised by his lack of effort, especially in the first 20-25 minutes where he was lazy(maybe even instructed?) just to stroll around and don't do any pressing or chase the ball at all, and his synchronisation with our other players was terrible, so many times they played to ball to his feet only for him to completely ignore it and turn his back and run in other direction. Really weird.

5031~~~
When we had players actually passing the ball to him you mean? Every ball today is launched towards him. We have had 25% of the ball in that half.

5032~~~
Needs to make himself a target. He's off on his bike looking for a though ball when it's never on.

5033~~~
Barebones support. Mata and Fellaini taking years to reach him. Rashford is playing as fullback basically.

5034~~~
Im pretty sure its a tactic because NO ONE is our team is pressing Liverpool from the front. There not much of a point Martial trying to press vs 3 players.

5035~~~
Needs to play on the left. Push rashford up front and Memphis on the right. Worth a shot.

5036~~~
He hasn't had the ball. Whenever he gets it he looks dangerous.

5037~~~
I think Messi is the one player who could have made a difference in Martial's position today. Maybe Drogba with his sheer power.
Are we already expecting those levels from Martial?

5038~~~
Worth a try, but with a non existent midfield.... probably won't make much of a difference

5039~~~
Why should he press when it's clearly not what Van Gaal has told the players to do? We've been fecking abysmal in defense and midfield and our wingers are playing as wing-backs, yet people are getting on Martial's back, who had to come up against 5 Liverpool players at once when the ref gave the advantage. I just don't get it. He hasn't been at his best recently, but it's pointless signaling him out in this game.

He was also our best outfield player against WBA. How has he been "awful" recently?

5040~~~
Nothing working for him tonight.

5041~~~
He's been very average recently.

5042~~~
Van Gaals fault!

5043~~~
Look like he is stop giving shit also can't blame him.

5044~~~
Have any of our attackers done well under LVG? Martial was the outlier for a while but he seems to have fallen into line now.

5045~~~
Yeah. You could put Pele up front, but he'd be hard pressed to do much given he'd see the ball about five times per match, and be utterly isolated each time he's fortunate enough to see the ball.

5046~~~
You know when you've been Van Gaaled.

5047~~~
Needs to play wide left. End of.

5048~~~
feel sorry for him, nothing he could do tonight. Isolated and doubled up on with no support.

5049~~~
Get Van Gaal away from him ASAP.

5050~~~
I should qualify (as I will with every player) that the set-up didn't help him at all. But yeah, he was dreadful even during those rare moments he did get hold of the ball.

5051~~~
Has to get so bloody deep just to get on the ball and then by some miracle hope that the dross around him in attack can play proper one-twos. It's painful to watch.

5052~~~
Was only a matter of time before he was infested. Surprised it took so long.

5053~~~
I'm not sure if he's tired or just sick to feck of playing in this dogshit system.

5054~~~
Been poor lately.

5055~~~
Looks like he finally understands the philosophy.

5056~~~
How is it that whoever plays as a striker loses form! Rooney was in decent form before he replaced RVP, and same for Martial. I've said it earlier, I'd say it again- LVG is a hopeless manager for strikers

5057~~~
Has been officially Van Gaalised.

5058~~~
Definitely in a poor run of form.

5059~~~
Here's the reason. All the strikers have either been past their best or nowhere near their peak. 30 and over or under 20. A crazy situation to be in.

There's no analysis of Martial needed. At his age with his inexperience what are we all expecting of him tonight?

5060~~~
Expected loss of form. 

Young player, who we ended up pinning all our hopes on too soon because everyone else is completely useless. Has hardly had a break and it's clearly taking an effect.
He also knows he doesn't have to fight to start a game because again, everyone else is so completely useless.

I'd give him a rest for at least a month to be honest, think our season will be done and dusted this time next week anyway so let the boy sit it out for a bit.

5061~~~
Yes, but the striker just doesn't lose form this suddenly. Rooney was good and people wanted him as striker till the point RVP was starting, Once Rooney became our #9, Rooney loses form, and similar case with Martial

5062~~~
1st touch was vile, yes Memphis pass had some pace on it but needed to better then what he did

5063~~~
No service at all.  Midfield absolutely dominated.

5064~~~
He's faded badly. I'm not surprised really, there's no confidence in the team.

LVG will ensure players like him don't succeed. We saw that with Rashford tonight too. Too much shackling of creative freedom.

5065~~~
Reluctant to go into a Rooney debate but he's clearly nowhere near the player he was at 25. Falcao isn't even a footballer anymore and RVP is now playing at a much lower standard.  Not their fault, it's the ageing process. 

They needed replacing but we chose to do it with a 19 year old with 50 career appearances.

It's not that LvG ruins strikers, it's that he's made terrible decisions with purchases and selections.

5066~~~
Non-existent when he plays up top. Not his fault, though. No service whatsoever. When he does get service, he takes too many touches because he's been starved.

5067~~~
Put him on the left and Rashford up top and get Memphis the feck out of the team unless we play the likes of Brugge or Midtittyland.

5068~~~
He looks tired and also short of service.
One criticism I would aim at him is that he always seems a bit on his heels rather than anticipating, hopefully once LvG has gone the new manager will improve this part of his game

5069~~~
He needs a proper manager to work with him. He's getting into bad habits (taking waaaaaay too much out of the ball being one of them). A season or two with a proper manager who lets him play would do wonders at his age. He could be an amazing footballer.

5070~~~
Predictable that he'd fade eventually with Van Gaal. Was a testament to his quality how long he actually looked like a quality player despite Van Gaal being in charge. He'll be a class player, and we'll be fine again as a team... Just once Van Gaal moves on.

5071~~~
Why does no one ever talk about his reluctance to make runs when we on a counter. I accept the attacks has too many holes for it to get him properly functional but he has to stop strolling when we are on a counter.

5072~~~
Hes 20 right? No surprise that hes some what fading out given the lack of rest (being injured isnt rest btw)

I dont fully agree cos he scored something like 4 goals in 4 games when he came in. Then when Rooney came back he was shifted out and then got like 4 in the next 16 games or something (dont quote me on that). 

I honestly think if hes been Vangaaled. He seriously is not getting the help he needs in this team and its the changing of positions, formations etc that is affecting him as well as others.

5073~~~
In hindsight we should have started with the system we started the second half with. We had much better control until we gave the stupid second goal away and Martial was more involved.

5074~~~
Definitely plays better on the left than upfront

5075~~~
To be honest i have felt for a while that he doesn't work nearly as hard as he should do in some games. A lot of the time if a ball doesn't fall perfectly at his feet he just lets it go instead of chasing it down and trying to make something out of it.

Though to be fair he might be knackered as he's played way more than he would have done if we had half decent attacking options.

Between that and trying to over complicate things by trying to dribble around 5-6 players when a simple give and go would be more effective. He can be frustrating to watch at times.

Yeah that frustrated the feck out of me tonight. In games like this he has to put more effort into holding the ball up to allow his team mates to break forward and support him.

Though to be fair he might be knackered as he's played way more than he would have done if we had half decent attacking options.

5076~~~
Same with Rashford.
Same with Di Maria.
Even Memphis had a few promising games at the start of his MUFC career.
All attackers seem to turned to shit under LVG, after promising starts.

The travesty is Di Maria. How can you make him play bad. Is that even possible? Well, LVG managed it.

5077~~~
Poor tonight, but I think he's not fully fit, or match fit at least. The support he gets is beyond awful.

5078~~~
To be fair, ADM playing on the wings has always been very hot and cold, long before he joined us. It was his performances from LCM that were incredible and he was much too fragile to play there consistently in the PL.

5079~~~
Sounds like what Rooney had to do all the time.

5080~~~
Surprise. It comes with how LVG wants the player to play #9 and I am not in the least bit baffle that Martial is struggling as did the list of other players who have played #9 for us. If you aren't a tireless machine who can play two positions at once at a high level like Olic, or a 6'5" beast who can hold the ball up and intricately lay it off with interplay around the area like Gomez then you're on a hiding to nothing playing up front for Van Gaal.

Martial is so very obviously not a #9 yet. He creates a huge problem at left forward because he is quite clearly worlds above Depay when it comes to using the ball on the flank and getting into scoring positions from what we've seen this season. I think he should definitely be playing on the left for the next couple of seasons at least.

5081~~~
He really does look off the pace at the moment. Think he desperately needs a rest.

5082~~~
He's better on the left, but he's been feeding off scraps since the Watford game. He had to make the most out of Blind's brainless hoofballs against WBA and still had a couple of nice moments where he showed his quality.

About yesterday - can't really fault him. His first touch let him down on a couple of occasions, but we were embarrassing all over the pitch (and on the bench), so can't really blame the #9. We were never close to creating a decent goalscoring chance.

I agree he needs a rest, though.

5083~~~
He'll be fine, we've asked far too much of him this year. He needs a holiday to de-stress and come back clean for next year.

I hope he doesn't make the French squad for Euro 2016, a month on the beach will do him the world of good.

5084~~~
He doesn't really know how to play as a true 9 yet, but what 19-20 year old really does. You have to be playing the game for a good few years to lead the line on your own and not be wasteful in possession and an attacking threat. Was getting dragged under the ball every time, not that lumping it up to him was a good idea anyway, and his touch was way off. Needs a rest, could really do with another striker to protect him when he's not having the best game.

5085~~~
I don't really get all these calls for a rest. He's just had a little break. 

It's not fatigue affecting his performances it's that he's just turned 20. We're seeing the inconsistency that we all expected.

What's annoying is that before his injury he was in very good form on the left. Since he's come back he's been rotated between right wing and centre forward.

It's maddening stuff from LvG. Nearly two years in and nobody in the front six has a set role.

5086~~~
Di Maria *cough cough*

5087~~~
The chemistry between him and the other attacking players has been generally poor. Don't know whether it is down to tactics, different styles of play but something in the communication between them is seriously wrong. 

Martial wasn't good on the ball last night and looked a bit languid at times but this has more to do with him being overused this season. We've relied too much on him in too many games. The same is with Smalling. They were our best outfield players but now look a bit knackered.

5088~~~
Naah,he hasn't been properly rotated. Being out due to an injury after being used 5-6 months without a rest isn't a genuine break. That's not enough. Rotation is key in keepeing palyers in good form both physically and mentally.

5089~~~
He was playing really well before his injury, no signs of fatigue, then had a two week break. Since coming back he's been a bit off. He's worse after having a rest. So putting it down to being tired doesn't make sense.

5090~~~
He had some excellent moments now and then but he wasn't all that against Chelsea and Sunderland. He almost disappeared in the second half vs Sunderland. The signs were there.

5091~~~
He was excellent against Derby and Stoke at the beginning of Feb. Decent against Chelsea and then scored a very good goal against Sunderland. Second half he was switched to right wing. I think that's why he disappeared.

Since then he's had a two week break. Do you think he's been better or worse since he came back?

5092~~~
Does anyone know how long VanGaalitis lasts for? Hopefully he's only got a light bout of the disease...

5093~~~
He had injury problems. It wasn't a proper rest for him, he wasn't being rotated in order to be kept fresh. I explained already above. It is one thing to play 5-6 months without being rested and to get a break due to an injury or being in the red zone; and it is quite another thing to be properly rotated during the season.

5094~~~
Looks tired somewhat. Also gets marked by like 2-3 players these days as soon as he has the ball. Would be great if opposition fans couldn't just concentrate on him to make us look toothless in attack but that's how it is.

5095~~~
I get your point about being rotated and rested throughout the season. 

However he has just gone two weeks without a game, that's still a rest. I think it's evident he's been worse since coming back from that rest.

He's just a young player having the fluctuations in form you'd expect.

5096~~~
That may be part of the reason why he has been a bit underwhelming at times, too.

5097~~~
He's facing the prospect of a 60+ game season when you include Euro 2016. He's been used far too often this season. 

Suffering from serious burnout.

He will need to shake thing up though, defenders are learning how he plays and he will need to combat that.

5098~~~
He's looked really unhappy on the pitch recently. I would too if I was being asked to follow this shit philosophy.

5099~~~
Should be Martial left and Depay up top

5100~~~
Carrying our attack, the norm.

5101~~~
Better today. It doesn't help that Rojo rarely provides the overlap.

Constantly faces 2 defenders. Shaw back would be a huge boost to our attack.

5102~~~
His best game in a while now. It's a shame we rely on a youngster to rescue us.

5103~~~
One of the few players who looked to make something happen in a game where we created little for much of it.

5104~~~
He was average until Bastian arrived on the pitch and seemingly turned the match around. Considering he was up against a makeshift RB, I was expecting more of him.

5105~~~
Was our only attacking player who looked he could make something happen. Glad he got that goal.

5106~~~
Good performance, he linked well around the box and looked the most likely to score for us, then scored and excellent goal from a move that he started and finished. No 20 year old should be relied on as he is at a club with our resources IMO.

5107~~~
Not his best game but got a hugely important goal and as always looked our one attacker with top class ability.

In those last 5 minutes I wish it was him and not Memphis in all that space on the left.

5108~~~
Absolutely amazing talent. The maturity of his game and decision making (apart from in shooting situations, which lets him down badly) is a very high level. 

He worked his socks off today defensively AND offensively. He constantly faced double/triple teams in the first half and regularly received the ball near the half way line than closer to the penalty area and still kept possession well, offering an outlet etc etc.

So much understated work that your typical Fifa playing fan don't see, 'he's a player with pace and trickery, why isn't he running behind and setting up goals like he's Robben?', such bs.

5109~~~
And he's only going to get better over the next few years. I do think we're overplaying him though - at his age he should be rested far more. 

Let's hope we can keep hold of him with no UCL football.

5110~~~
He's one of the few reasons i've still enjoyed watching united play this season.

5111~~~
He looks tired to be fair.

5112~~~
Is he the only player capable of getting shots on target and scoring goals in this team? It looks that way, imagine if we had add a couple more quality attacking players how much more of a threat he could be.

5113~~~
15 goals would be a good return in his first season in English football.

Hopefully he can get 4 more at least.

5114~~~
I think Martial will start to excel further when he is surrounded with better players and more movement in the final third. Majority of the current players are far too static which creates no space for other individuals on the pitch.

5115~~~
This.

5116~~~
he wasn't good in the first half, his dribbling was way off, if it was lingard he would be called to be sold, he got better in the second half and scored which is always nice for a striker, still think he needs to work hard to become a proper no9, he's curerntly much more effective from the left wing but maybe it's the lack of quality on wings that put us in a situation like this when we need to play him on the left to have at least one player who can beat a man, I wouldn't certainly mind to play him from the left even next year, it's good for him to get on the ball as much as possible and we should try to sign Kane/Lukaku as our new no9, they are more suited to that role, Martial can tear teams from the left and from the right we would do with Griezmann who could be also great backup striker, Martial-Kane-Griezmann =  some firepower, Martial-Lukaku-Griezmann doesnt sound bad either and is way more realistic though..

5117~~~
I'm his fan but I don't get how this is called a good performance - certainly not by his standard.His dribbling was a bit off.

I would love to rest him when we can to avoid fatigue.

5118~~~
People forget he is just 20 and this is his first full season, ever. 
Calm down, he will have shit games and good ones.

5119~~~
Struggled against a quick wingback without any help on the overlap from Rojo. The issue is in the way our team is set up; doesn't really help ease the burden from the individual player having to create and take multiple players on. Its silly, but i think he played hard and deserved he goal. His decision making needs to improve which is nothing new for a player his age.

5120~~~
He played 48 times for Monaco last year.

Agree in general with everything else though.

5121~~~
With forwards, you don't expect 90+ minutes of outstanding play.  You expect a forward to score when the opportunity presents itself.  Martial came through for us today.

But the boy needs rest.  It's a shame we can't give it to him right now.

5122~~~
His performances on the left to me is showing why he should eventually be playing as an AM. 

Him leading the line leaves him having to move around all over the place to get in to space. 

Playing in the centre away from the busy CB's ( holding on to our central striker) would leave martial to pick and choose spaces to dribble on to. The same way mata play playoff 3 attackers trying to pick a pass; martial should be there picking empty spaces playing balls in to and off our forwards.


Replacing Passing players like Carrick & even Mata are the least needed considering the whole squad can pass for 60% of the time. We need to line up much more vertical and with intent.

5123~~~
we are burning this lad down.

5124~~~
Anyone see him as an AM/CF similar to how tevez used to play for us? 

I think him leading the line is not using him to the best of his abilities. I love how precise his dribbling is and he could consistently be in a position to dribble in to open spaces.

5125~~~
If the manager is willing to use 442 or 4411 formation he could also be suitable as a second striker role to support the number 9 in my opinion.

5126~~~
His passing isn't good enough to play a deeper role through the centre, and he's fairly one-footed. Out wide is the best place to utilise his pace and insanely tight close control. The only issue is keeping him involved in the match long enough to do damage, he can fizzle out a lot at the minute because we aren't getting the ball to him quick enough in advanced positions, or he just stands still too often waiting for the ball to come to him.

5127~~~
His future is probably as a central striker, but I see no reason why we can't keep him out on the left, cutting in, for the time being. It's where he's done his best work so far this season. For me, we should be buying a striker this summer that would work well with him.

5128~~~
He made Clyne shit himself, absolutely owning him. Haven't seen defender being so scared against us for a long time.

5129~~~
He's terrific. Looks dangerous every time he's on the ball, got lots of little moments of skill and trickery, and consistently offers us more in attack than any other player.

5130~~~
He deserves so much better than our shit team, just hire Mou already and let him build a winning team around this guy.

5131~~~
Was a threat throughout, just too isolated.

5132~~~
Thought he played well. We don't get him enough of the ball, but he looked consistently threatening whenever he was on it. The only attacker in our team who offered anything substantial.

5133~~~
Constantly had 3 players on him. The other players need to help create space for the lad.

5134~~~
Tried to make things happen, along with Rashford.

5135~~~
Martial and Rashford were decent, we really need an equally dangerous right wing.

5136~~~
Tried to make something happen. Gulf between him and the other players bar Rashford was huge in ability.

5137~~~
Really wouldn't be surprised if he left us in the summer, along with De Gea.

5138~~~
He did all he could and along with Rashford at least caused Liverpool some problems.

5139~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> feck off

5140~~~
He's an unreal talent. On par with the best we've had of that age.

5141~~~
Excited to see what he can do when we've got other dangerous attackers and defenders can't triple team him every time.

5142~~~
He and De Gea were the only ones worthy the shirt tonight.

5143~~~
Honestly, give me one reason why he'd stay?

5144~~~
This is officially his most prolific season now. 12 goals for us + 1 for Monaco in August.

5145~~~
4 years left on a big contract, at a club where he can earn ever increasingly astronomical amounts over his career and at a club where the current manager will soon be leaving and a new manager with a huge budget will take over.

5146~~~
he is double tripled marked... Opponents know that he is the only one that needs to be marked out of the game.. 
Rashford--Martial --<RW>  could be a front three that could cause havoc.. How we wished Memphis was that player..

5147~~~
Only reason to watch United nowadays is this kid.

5148~~~
If, say, one of the top teams comes knocking (Barcelona, Bayern, Real etc.), none of those reasons can stop him from leaving. (Obviously, IF he wants to leave)

5149~~~
Don't get why we don't, you know, pass him the ball about 90% of the time. It's all van Gaal's Dutch side did with Robben and it worked pretty well.

5150~~~
You don't think we'd be able to tell a club like that to do one?

5151~~~
Because that would involve the players around him giving a toss.

5152~~~
Of course. However, what if Martial insisted on leaving this dumb?

Anyway, no point in arguing over this, we'll only go around in circles. I, for one, hope he isn't even considering it. He's a joy to watch.

5153~~~
He seems like a smart kid. As talented as he is he'll know he has no chance of getting into Barca's team regularly, probably the same with Real depending on who they bring in.

5154~~~
If Benzema doesn't get called up he might get his chance and set euro 2016 alight. The only success he'll be tasting for a while.

5155~~~
He was really good tonight, very lively. He just needs better players around him, imagine if we had Shaw and Di Maria linking up with him down the left... That could have been a reality with a bit of luck...

One thing he does have to work on - striking the ball with power. He seems to have almost mastered the placed curling shot but I'm struggling to recall a sweetly struck shot where has put his through and got it on target. Not bringing this up because he had a few wayward attempts tonight but just an observation from the season so far.

5156~~~
His best game tonight, really stepped up to the occasion just not quite at the level to do it all on his own 'yet'

5157~~~
He will be in the squad regardless of whether Benzema gets called up or not.

5158~~~
I was hoping to see him start. Maybe he will anyway, since he's started on the left for them the last few friendlies.

5159~~~
Twitter followers. He's young enough that it might matter to him. Fingers crossed.

5160~~~
I thought he had Clyne in his pocket for the entire game tonight. He's an incredible talent.

5161~~~
His crossing has improved too.

5162~~~
Good game. Had a fine defensive full back on toast.

5163~~~
Also, you didn't add that he admitted playing for United being his dream.

5164~~~
Should be on pen-duty for the rest of his United career.

One of our most composed finishers.

5165~~~
Was brilliant first half I thought. But I have no idea why we didnt use him more second half or use him to get others free if he was being marked by 2 or 3 guys.

TBH, hes our only outfield threat.

5166~~~
An absolute top guy. Tries to play football, tries to make things happen...

A proper United player

5167~~~
I was actually scared he would miss. I think Herrera is a better penalty taker though. He absolutely whacks them hard into the top corner.

5168~~~
Was surprised how he got up and got the ball for the penalty, shows great character. Seems he is getting more comfortable game by game.

We have a great talent on our hands, and if we can't build around him it would be such a waste. 

Also, if we had used him more in isolation with clyne second half, he would've created or gotten him sent off.

5169~~~
As a young talent at Manchester United, he is up there with Rooney and Ronaldo for me. The kid is simply a phenomenal talent. He's got magic in his feet, a smart footballing brain, an eye for a pass, a good finish, good hold up play, pace, pretty much the lot. He also seems to be a very composed young man. In most big games this season, he's done well. He's done well against Liverpool, was the best player against City, in the do or die game vs Wolfsburg he stepped up with the first goal, and even against Chelsea he was the best attacker on the pitch (definitely ours).

While I've always thought should be a CF for us, his ability on the ball might just be too good for that. I still feel his hold up play is miles better than Rooney or Rashford or Wilson, so maybe rotating will be apt.

5170~~~
The highlight of our season. Can't wait to see him play for a different manager with better players and tactics which will ensure he has more space and chances to do his thing. Most of the time he's feeding off scraps/aimless hoofballs and is constantly being double or tripple marked. No surprises there, though...who'd bother marking Mata or Lingard?

5171~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

We do need to sort this out. Martial has 2-3 defenders on him all the time. We need some sort of threat from the other side.

5172~~~
It is kinda the case for all attacking players really. It is just that Martial's gifts on the ball are almost godly.

I hope we play him as a left sided forward next season and give him the room to use his gifts. I don't really think he has the space to work his magic when he is at #9.

5173~~~
Yep. Kind of makes life easy for the opposition to pluck 2-3 defenders on him. They can leave the rest 1 v 1. Heck, going by the form of most of our players, they can leave themselves 1 v 2 and still look comfortable.

5174~~~
Wouldn't go that far just yet...  if the keeper went the right way yesterday he'd have said Martials penalty. It was at a nice height and not right in the corner.

Anyway, it's amazing how shite we are when we have this absolute gem of a player out our disposal. It's a true testament to LVG really.

5175~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5176~~~
Yeah, I agree. I used to think he's better as a number 9, but his running at defenders is far to good to not use him on the left. I feel he's too isolated when playing up front, so he's more useful on the left in Van Gaal's "tactics". Things could be entirely different under another manager, though.

5177~~~
Agree. I'd like to see him rotating between the two roles under the next managing. Under LVG keep him LW so that he gets more of the ball.

5178~~~
Swinging in off the left he is devastating. He's literally flamethrowere'd about 6 right left backs this season. We must work on his tactical positions that he takes up in the off season and work on building his end product to complement the attacking unit and when to be selfish and when not to.

I mean, the guy is just an other worldly fantastic player and it has been a real shame that this has been such a shit of a season that it has almost eclipsed how bright Martial's talent is.

When you contrast it with Depay I think Depay has better reading of where his positioning is supposed to move him around on the field. He pops up and commands the space a bit better than Martial in my opinion but his work on the ball is usually "head down and just run as hard and as fast on the ball at goal as possible" where as Martial is always scanning, always looking around and will use subtlety to complement his pace, skill and speed.

Not to roast Depay, but I would like to see them both work on their game at left forward in the off season and come back stronger players for it.

5179~~~
What really annoys me with both Martial and Memphis is that they never play off the shoulder and try make the run behind the full back.  They always take the ball to feet and slow down the attack. They both have the pace to break the offside trap too
I can only presume it's the managers instructions as Memphis used to score loads of goals in the channels for psv. Memphis has better movement than martial also... But his touch,decisions and dribbling are nowhere near Martials.

5180~~~
Well, I can only assume that it is either not the directive or that it is part of Van Gaal's passing philosophy that has rendered that type of play out of the play book. They really should do it more, Memphis especially. But as they have to drop more to support I guess we see them getting on the shoulder a lot less. I can only theorize that a lot of our players don't make those runs because barely anybody attempts those passes from deeper.

Also, ninja edit your quote because I meant to say "Martial torched right backs", not left backs. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

5181~~~
12 Goals & 7 Assists in 38 in his first season at age 20 with a counter-productive style, incompetent manager and a dreadful team whilst playing mostly LW, (and sometimes ST and RW)

Would be fantastic if he ends his first season with 15.

5182~~~
This.  You guys have got a real star in the making.  Hope you hold on to him (you're not as mighty as you once were you know <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/> ) and get a positive manager in who can utilise martial properly.

5183~~~
Memphis its even more annoying because he hasn't got the ability to beat players or hold up the ball like Martial.

Watching Neymar, this has probably been his most improved aspect of the game at Barcelona. He is consistently making runs in behind. Although, playing for Barcelona its a lot easier to be a willing runner because you know they have players who will try and most of the time find you with the right pass.

5184~~~
Can't wait to watch him in the summer for France, he's a special player.

5185~~~
From the earlier parts of the season, most opposition teams used to defend deep, so there usually wasn't much space to run into anyways. But recently, I think that has changed. Martial always tries to beat the offside trap when running into the channels from what I have seen. Even in the pool game, you could see Martial and Rashford regularly doing that. Memphis obviously hasn't played enough in recent games to really merit a more current discussion.

5186~~~
We've got no one who can make those passes... I don't blame them for not running in behind.

5187~~~
Sad but true amol <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Damning indictment on our play and standard of our squad

EDIT: Excellent interview.

5189~~~
Some more from that interview in the MEN: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-anthony-martial-ronaldo-11065268" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...ester-united-anthony-martial-ronaldo-11065268</a>

“I am a striker but I love playing wide,"

"The main thing is wherever I play I enjoy it and help the team.

"I must continue to work hard in training. I need to think more like a goalscorer, sometimes I get so immersed in the game because I love general play so much.

"Someone like Cristiano Ronaldo focuses on scoring to progress, so perhaps I need to think more about scoring."

----

"I don't go out a lot as I like to stay in," he said.

"I often go for dinners with my girlfriend and I love to see movies at the cinema but I don't understand them. We go for walks and to the shops."

Martial told Sky Sports' Geoff Shreeves the last film he saw was the 1986 cult David Bowie film <i>Labyrinth</i>.

5190~~~
Going to read/watch the interview later but it shows the incredible self awareness and maturity of this lad judging by the quotes above.

We've side stepped the poorer aspects of his game because it's so obvious the talent he has AND shows on the pitch but for him to realise, he needs to be more effective than pretty i.e playing on the shoulder, playing a one-two instead of stopping the ball and dribbling from a standstill, looking for more goals (in turn that will open up space for his dribbles etc) is amazing. 

Seriously can't wait til we get Shaw fit again and have a manager, who recognises this. Oh and to get rid of Rooney.

5191~~~
He is very mature and level-headed for his age.

5192~~~
Such a class interview that, seems happy here although staying in all the time won't do much for him, wonder if he's good mates with anyone in the team yet?

5193~~~
As a Bowie Fan he would tell you he knows when to go out and when to stay in.

5194~~~
Such is our weird links with Cavani every year and the general shit house nature of our board and it's member, I hope to God there is nowt in the rumours about the Cavani swap deal

5195~~~
Hernandez scored 20 goals in 42 appearances his first season. He is pretty close to that. Martial is younger as well and playing in such an ill-flowing attack.

5196~~~
Of course there's nothing in the rumours.

5197~~~
That'll do me

5198~~~
I just saw his interview with Geoff. I think Anthony is my soul mate. We both look indifferent on the outside, love to stay at home or go to the movies. He also seems like a genuinely kind guy who puts other before himself. Would bang.

5199~~~
Niall Quinn has just said that he's flattered to deceive. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

Souness completely overruled him and said "Nahhh" mid sentence. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5200~~~
"Martial has flattered to deceive" - Niall Quinn

5201~~~
Think hes been poor. Doesnt seem to be trying as hard as he could.

5202~~~
Think you could say that about most players on the pitch today, such a flat game as a whole. Think Martial has been ok, he looks better with Rashford and Lingard making runs off him.

5203~~~
I don't think he is anything special today, probably should have passed it to Lingard when he decided to take a shot. Tbf, I don't think we are giving him much freed either, he hardly leaves his position.

5204~~~
He does some great stuff and then loses the ball so meekly in dangerous areas.

Sometimes needs to just kick it long.

5205~~~
He's so good.

5206~~~
Christ, he's an absolute warlock on the ball sometimes. I think he needs to be left side forward again next season and just get him running at fullbacks. He sat Sagna a couple of times today.

5207~~~
He's been playing non-stop for us. About time he gets a proper rest.

5208~~~
He's incredible.

5209~~~
Yeah, I agree.

5210~~~
I think he was great yet again.

5211~~~
One thing I think that's really understated about Martial is his work-rate off the ball when he plays on the left flank, he's such a mature footballer already in his decision making and he just needs to iron out a few kinks technically I feel.

5212~~~
Such a brilliant player. Can't wait to see him in a properly functioning side with more quity around him.

5213~~~
People are sayin he was meh? wow

5214~~~
I thought he made a lot of poor choices today which stopped us from creating good chances. Sometimes he makes very strange runs off the ball when the obvious run into the space might have seen him reach Rashford's cross right in front of the goal. Still he looks a class above most of our team.

5215~~~
We have the best young player in the world, we need to look after him and build around him.

5216~~~
Sour face Souness was waxing lyrical about him.

Kid's going to be an absolute star.

5217~~~
He is so hardworking off the ball, have not really thought that he would be like that for a forward. Compare that to Mata or Depay, he is running his socks off every game. His dribbling is amazing, only his decision making isnt right up there with his other ability currently.

5218~~~
He's played a lot of football and he's doing alright. A few more goals and it'll be a very respectable season.

5219~~~
apart some nice moments, he was quite terrible today but he is the most likeable player here so everybody will forgive how many times he gave the ball away and set up a counter attack, obviously needs rest but we have none else to start

5220~~~
He's young, played in an inferior league. As he said himself, the pace and physicality of the premier league is like no other. This guy is going to learn and get better and better. Brilliant temperament, hard trainer apparently and looks after himself. We need to keep this guy.

5221~~~
His maturity is quite phenomenal. It was quite clear that the 'talismanic' players like Schweinsteiger, Carrick and Schneiderlin were looking to feed him the ball to take responsibility when the game grew scrappier and scrappier.

5222~~~
Totally agreed. He ran at them time and time again worked his socks and although he didn't score was a great outlet down the left.

5223~~~
France should rest him actually, because he would not have any break at all before Euro's if they don't and that will be a problem in the summer for them.

5224~~~
Worked his buns off in the first half with doses of quality, in the second he did the same and looked our best outlet when trying to relieve the pressure. He's so smooth on the ball and just looks like he's destined for the very top.

5225~~~
Thought he was poor today,( I think mainly due to tiredness) but along with Rashford, has been  one of the few highlights of this season, so he gets a free pass from me.

5226~~~
Thought he was great.

5227~~~
I think it will hurt more when we let him go to Madrid than it did with Ronaldo..

5228~~~
Reading back through the first few pages of this thread and found this gem. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5229~~~
I thought he was exceptional today. One of his best games for us imo.

5230~~~
The maturity and completeness of his game at 20 is astonishing. He was very good again today.

5231~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5232~~~
Excellent again today, hope he carries it on between now and the end of the season

5233~~~
Needs a rest. I imagine hes going with France to the Euros and will get games for them too. 

Agreed, his off the ball work is great.

5234~~~
Shudder to think what he looks like playing in a good team. Looks France's best player every time I watch them.

5235~~~
I also thought he played great today

5236~~~
Btw no time for him to rest now. 8 big games left to salvage 4th and cup game at Wes Ham. We need our best attacker for every one of those.

5237~~~
That's what I thought. He did well today.

5238~~~
Thought it was one of his lesser games today. Great young player, though.

5239~~~
Someone get a gif of that run he went on at the end when Rashford was down injured. Brilliant bit of play to relieve the pressure.

5240~~~
I Think souness is the best and fairest pundit of all them.

5241~~~
He's absolute class.

5242~~~
I can't stop smiling when i think about how good he already is and how good he will be in the future! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5243~~~
Wait for Madrid to come sniffing..
So good this kid

5244~~~
Yes, he's class. I get the impression the plan was to use him sparingly this season but with a good rest this summer I think he will ultimately benefit from virtually a full season. He's such a smooth player with an effortless look about him and that turn of pace from a standing start is a great asset. 

Don't think he'll ever be a 20-25 goal a season striker because of the way he naturally drifts wide but 15 a season with everything else he brings will do nicely.

5245~~~
Fecking love this guy,there was 3 city players around him at one stage today.
Hopefully a few decent signings a good manager in charge and the fact he has a debut season under his belt he will become even better.

5246~~~
That was absurd, I couldn't believe how he was holding on to the ball and going past the City players when it was just him against like four of them

5247~~~
No reason why he cant be. Basically a 15 goal player this season while spending the majority on the left and it being his first in the prem, and playing for a struggling united side that is so poor going forward. Put him in a better functioning and he can definitely get over 20 goals a season playing as a wide forward. Easily can be that if he was a striker consistently but I feel like he would be a bit wasted because of his dribbling.

5248~~~
Thought his turn to set up a shot for himself (not long after the goal) was really nice.

5249~~~
Sourness loves himself a bit of Martial.

5250~~~
Teams aren't doubling up on him as much cause they also have Rashford's pace to worry about.

5251~~~
You know his good when Souness likes him. Wonderful player.

5252~~~
I still wish he slipped a through ball to Rashford instead, would've been another goal easily. But not complaining, he has that killer instinctive that will serve him well as a striker in the long run.

5253~~~
Again such a threat. What a talent, already.

5254~~~
Won't he be in the Euro squad? He seems to be a part of the NT now...

5255~~~
Fantastic player that we have on our hands. 

Absolute class.

5256~~~
I thought that he was again one of our best players - only Rashford and Smalling were better. So fecking threatening <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5257~~~
Probably our most talented player along with DDG. 

Always has a good game, always terrorises defences.

5258~~~
We need to make sure he is here for long, the future is bright with Martial.

5259~~~
Can't wait to see him play for France again.  As good as he looks for us, he looked even better playing alongside class players for France whenever I watch them. Remember the game against against Germany where he looked a class above every player on the pitch including Griezmann.

5260~~~
It's great how no one gives a shit about his price any more. He's been that good.

5261~~~
Imagine, a few years ago saying we spent 50m on a striker and he scored 12 in 39 games. Doubt we'd be close to as happy as we are(rightly as he's been awesome) with Martial.

5262~~~
We just need better players around him to compliment his talent.  Sometimes he's so damn quick no one can keep up with him.

5263~~~
Depends. I think we would still be delighted with his obvious technique, moments of breathtaking skill and even goal return as he's started 75 percent of his matches on the left instead of up front.

All this at 19-20? Nah, the caf isn't that dumb to not recognize his worth. Not now, not three years ago.

5264~~~
We need a quality right winger to make things easier for him. The opponents know we're going to do close to feck all on the right and are concentrating all their defensive efforts on Martial. Yet, he still finds a way to piss all over their fullbacks and make things happen against 2-3 players at a time.

5265~~~
"The Premier League is more physically demanding than Ligue 1. I love English football, it's the best in the world in my opinion, and I hope to stay here for many years to come. It's true that the atmosphere here is quite different from the one in France, people live and breathe football here, and that's what I like, every footballer wants to play in the Premier League. In France it's easy to know which team is going to win the game, where as in England anywhere you play, you know it's going to be difficult. I think it made me realise how physically strong I am, I wasn't aware of it while playing for Monaco, as I wasn't playing consistently. I think the manager believes in me and I make sure I look after myself as well as my diet in order to be fit for games."

5266~~~
Almost sure he'll get called up this summer barring injury.

5267~~~
A player as good as Martial... if he doesn't turn into a 30+ a season player, there is something seriously wrong. He needs to be hitting insane numbers with the talent he has. Anything less would be a major disappointment in my opinion. He has Ronaldo level potential and if anything is more mature and dangerous than a young Cristiano.

5268~~~
It depends if LVG is in charge.
While LVG is in charge, none of our strikers will score lots of goals.
As an example, Martial is on 7 league goals right now. For comparison, the top goal scorer (Kane), is on 19.

5269~~~
Do you see him as a winger even in the future or will he be the main striker?

5270~~~
I prefer him in the winger role, for now at least. He's just one of those magical players that you want to get on the ball as much as possible. Out wide is where we can do that.

5271~~~
He should have played Rashford through on goal. Really annoying that he didn't spot/chose to ignore that run.

5272~~~
He looks much more confident lately. The way he picked up the ball against liverpool, and his shooting from distance on more than one occasion yesterday. 

What a phenomenal talent. Its such a joy having a player like him to watch week in week out.

5273~~~

5274~~~
Booty pop!

5275~~~
the most pleasing thing about his development. Up until the last few he's simply been refusing to shoot from distance even when in space.

5276~~~
The best thing about him, is that he never really has a poor game. He might be quiet but he's always technically good and still causes problems. At his age to have a level of consistency like that is very impressive.

5277~~~
It's obvious to say but having Rashford next to him has upped his game because 1) he has someone to finally play with (i.e not Rooney) and 2) I think he has some pride in not letting the other teenage sensation up stage him. 

Body language expert here.

5278~~~
He's just so good already, God knows how good he could be if he fulfils his potential. 

Probably the only 100% successful signing we've made since Fergie went.

5279~~~
I've always been eh on him being a striker and wish we would keep him out wide.

But something about the City game, I could just envisage him as our big number 9, taking players on, dropping deep and terrorising defences.

A complete forward.

He's so good I'm already worried about losing him if we don't sort our shit out.

With Martial, DDG, Smalling and Shaw we've got four excellent players and we also have promising young players coming through. It's a good foundation for a manager to come in and build upon, but we really need to sort the manager situation this summer to start doing that. 

Losing Martial before he has the chance to perform in a top team would be heartbreaking.

5281~~~
Completely agree here. Plus with the pace he has, he finally has someone like Rashford that can match his pace. Both of them up top are a nightmare for any defense. Huge tests coming up for both of them against Everton and Spurs, especially the latter.

5282~~~
He just said he wants to be here for many years.

5283~~~
Is he a Mourinho type player ? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

5284~~~
Really excited to many many years of a brilliant Martial and Rashford partnership. If either of Memphis/Lingard/Januzaj/Pereira come good, that will be icing on the cake.

We just need a pacey right/left back and our attack will terrorize opposition defences on the counter.

5285~~~
Could be reminiscent to Eto'o in his Inter team. Cuts inside and is quick, powerful and pretty lethal. There were actually some rumours early on in the window that Chelsea were in for Martial.

Jose's had some truly fantastic wingers in Cristiano, Hazard, Robben, Duff, Willian, Di Maria etc. they've been so important to his counter-attacking concept and I don't see any reason why Martial couldn't be. His willingness to track is pretty fantastic too.

5286~~~
He's every managers type player.

5287~~~
Imagine Mourinho comes and doesn't fancy him. We would sack him on the spot.

5288~~~
Chelsea went in big for Martial is the rumour.

5289~~~
Jose wanted Martial at Chelsea so he will love him here

<b>Deschamps looking for improvement from Martial

</b>
France national team manager Didier Deschamps is seeking “improvement” from Manchester United striker Anthony Martial.

The France frontman, 20, became the world’s most expensive teenager last summer when United paid Monaco £36million for the former Lyon star.

Martial, who has been capped six times by Les Bleus, is in line to face the Netherlands and Russia in friendlies this week and Deschamps believes the frontman has justified his hefty price tag.


“Anthony is young but he has confirmed his potential in Manchester despite the weight of the price of his transfer,” said Deschamps.

“He has progressed, he plays a lot. He is young and he is not tired.

“He is doing very interesting things with speed and impact. Usually he plays on the left but he can play as centre-forward too.

“It’s good, he continues to progress, he comes regularly for the French national team [but] he has a lot of room for improvement.”

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.football365.com/news/martial-discusses-his-favourite-playing-position" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000">Martial, who recently hinted he prefers to play out wide,</span></a>  has scored 12 goals in 39 appearances for United and was a one of United’s better performers in Sunday’s 1-0 derby win over Man City.

United boss Louis van Gaal last month admitted Martial’s form for United had exceeded his own expectations after he scored in the 3-0 win over Stoke.

“He was 19 (when he signed) and now he is 20 so that is surprising when you come from the French league to the Premier League and you can do this,” said the Dutch boss.

5291~~~
precisely

5292~~~
Mourinho wanted to sign him last summer apparently. Anyway, he suits him perfectly. Mourinho has used loads of young players in his career. What he hasn't done is developed them through the youth team, but in terms of signing young players for the first team and using them as key players, he's never shied away from doing that. They just have to be good enough to make an impact already.

5293~~~

5294~~~
Just got a nice assist for France.

5295~~~
Yep, lovely pass. He's a magical player.

5296~~~
That assist was exactly what Memphis was missing from his game tonight. Great awareness.

5297~~~
He got two assists. <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

Neither of them had particularly great games tonight though.

5298~~~
Yup, both set pieces. Nothing to do with awareness when he had the ball. He made plenty of bad decisions in possession.

I thought Martial did ok, he had this assist and another good run and shot deflected wide. But nowhere close to Payet or Matuidi.

Blind was probably the best United player on the pitch, and he was part of a defence that conceded 3 <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5299~~~
I know I just fancied being argumentative <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Agreed he didn't really do a lot wrong.

5300~~~
He's a class player. Had an average game but still created 4 or 5 openings in 45 mins.

5301~~~
Didn't watch the game, but saw France's third goal. Blind's specialty of faffing about with the ball only to play a garbage, doomed hoofball was on show once again. It really pisses me off, because he's doing it all the time for us as well.

As for Martial - great assist from the lad. Special talent. You just get the feeling he's destined for the top.

5302~~~

5303~~~
France's jersey look absolutely hideous.

5304~~~
Anything happen him tonight? Just checked my sports App and said he was subbed off at 46 minutes, which unless it's a mistake and they meant subbed off as the second half was about to kick off, it would mean he was injured?

5305~~~
It'll mean he didn't come out for second half.

Sites like soccerway have 46' for when a player is replaced at HT.

5306~~~
Was worried there for a minute, cheers! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5307~~~
We probably gave France instructions for him not to play more than 45 minutes. There no reports that he's injured.

5308~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nyCHb2oAYh4?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

5309~~~
No injuries. He was terrible though, France's worst player in that half. Doesn't help that everyone else was playing good to great and that his replacement (coman) scored a stunner and did succeed in his dribbles.

5310~~~
Van Gaal Effect.

5311~~~
I'd say he is pretty much overplayed at this stage. Would have been nice if could have gotten some rest through these friendly games. On top of that for all his talent he will be inconsistent at his age. We shouldn't even be at a point where we need to hope that a 20 year old can somewhat carry a team full of experienced international player.

5312~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5313~~~
Where would we be without this guy. 
The club has been a two man band this season, him and Dave. 
The club deserves credit. The football world thought we were nuts when we paid potentially €80m for this guy. I reckon we are going to pay all the clauses.

5314~~~
Hoping he's not injured.

5315~~~
He's just got so much in his game, if our right side had more of the same he'd find it easier as well because right now teams are doubling up on him as lot. He also puts a really dogged defensive shift in for the team.

5316~~~
"£50m down the drain, Tony Martial scores again"

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5317~~~
That song is going to be stuck in my head all evening... <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5318~~~
I may be bashed for this.
Although he scored and played pretty decent, felt he was a tad too selfish. there were instances where I felt he should have passed but goes about dribbling, which although in general isn't too bad for a player his control but needs to understand that passing is a better option. But again he is young and this part will improve with experience

5319~~~
I somewhat agree. In terms of all round game I thought Jesse and Rashford played better than him today, but he's just so phenomenally talented that if you had to pick which one of them would score the winner you'd have always backed Martial. 

Good to see that his passing wasn't that slightly tired-looking, half-hearted stuff too like we've seen in a few games from him recently.

5320~~~
He will turn into an Henry-esque player. He has so much potential.

5321~~~
The most "unachievable" one is him getting on the Balon shortlist (23 players), which will probably happen in the next 2 years.

He'll be worth the fee, as long as he stays with us for the majority of his career.

5322~~~
He looked absolutely knackered at the end. I thought he was actually quite sloppy and made more bad decisions than usual today but he's still head and shoulders above everyone in the side. Like watching a kickabout in the park until it gets to him and he does something good.

5323~~~
On course for 15 goals this season.

5324~~~
3 goals in the last 4 games. He's back! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

5325~~~
40 appearances for us plus internationals and some games with Monaco. On course for a 60+ game season and still has to go to the euros. The guy needs a rest.

5326~~~
I guess his sloppiness towards the end was because he was in pain.

5327~~~
He's not two years from being in top 23 footballers in Europe, that's too much to ask for for now. 4-5 years and we may be talking, few players get close at 22-23.

5328~~~
Think he's talented enough to be in that bracket at 23. People were saying Hazard  was in that bracket last year. I don't think Hazard was as good as Martial at 20.

5329~~~
Even if he doesn't stay with us for that long, we will easily make our money back on selling him if he wants to leave.

5330~~~
You're probably right, but these lists are bullshit, and if we get our shit together and he continues to be our best attacking player he'll be on the list, regardless if he actually merits the inclusion.

5331~~~
Yep. If we are winning trophies in two years it will be largely due to Martial. I don't think we will be though.

5332~~~
He is class, I hope the limping at the end wasn't anything serious.

5333~~~
Class act, just oozing quality. Didn't think he was at his best and made some bad decisions but still on a different level to the rest of both sets of players.

5334~~~
Tony Martial came from France,
English press said he had no chance,
50 million down the drain....
As Tony Martial scores again! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5335~~~

5336~~~
Plays with no fear. Needs a rest but we cant afford to do so. With Euros coming up, we need to manage him properly to stop second season burnout.

5337~~~
That's brilliant <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5338~~~
Really appreciated his defensive side today as well. What a player.

5339~~~
Apart from the bit when he badly switched off and let Coleman get behind him! Just after he scored too.

He did the job pretty well most the game though, he's improved at that massively through the season.

5340~~~
Starting to think his future may lie on the left instead of upfront. His dribbling is his biggest asset and he's still a massive goal threat coming inside like he does. Maybe similar to Ronaldo, a striker/left winger hybrid.

5341~~~
Awesome. Made my day.

5342~~~
Balon D'or shortlist is probably like 15 attackers, though, right? He could crack that:

Messi, Suarez, Neymar
Ronaldo, Bale, James
Muller, Lewandowski
Griezmann,
Aguero, De Bruyne
Hazard
Ozil, Sanchez

that's 14. I could see Martial joining the bottom names on that list in 2 years.

5343~~~
I agree. I think perhaps we were just desperate to get him up front because we were so used to seeing Rooney be useless there, when actually his skillset may be better suited to a wide role after all. He can still be a 20+ goal a season player from the wing, and could be an assist machine if we got a really good striker up front.

5344~~~
I saw him put in some good defensive efforts today as well.  Very special to contribute a gamewinning goal the day Sir Bobby was honored.

5345~~~
13 goals. 7 assists. From a 20 year old brought in for crazy money in his debut season in the most competitve league in the world, as the main man in a toothless attack.
I wouldn't want to hype him up ... but he'll probably be the best player in the world someday. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5346~~~
a poacher's goal today which is nice.

agree that left wing forward is his position now. enable him to use his pace and dribble ability, as well as chance for him to cut inside and have a go at goal. just want to see him taking his shot as soon as he gets that extra few yards rather than trying to do something else, us wandering inside everton's final third area without trying to shot at goal was frustrating to watch yesterday.

5347~~~
Links up very well with Rashford. Once he comes inside from the left he can really open teams up. I think one of the things he can improve is his decision making after he receives the return ball, he just needs to shoot earlier sometimes. He's getting in good positions, then attempting to dribble past the crowd. What a phenomenal talent though, a joy to watch.

5348~~~
Honestly didn't expect him to have so much impact in his first season. What a gem.

5349~~~
Absolutely agree, first half there was a chance created by Rashford with a backheel and Martial got in, got a touch, next move should be a shot since he was around 12-13rd yard but he took another touch and it killed him. It's sometimes as if we're trying to walk the ball into the net.

5350~~~
That's exactly the chance i was thinking about. Just go for goal. After his goal against stoke, i know he has that ability, he just needs to start shooting more.

5351~~~
Is he eligible for the PL Young player of the year ? Because if he is, he wins it by a landslide for me. Wasn't probably as effective yesterday with his dribbling, but still had some really great link up play with Rashy. That little set-up they had in the 2nd half near the wing, to bring the ball into the box was just <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5352~~~
No. Just no.

5353~~~
i think he is eligible yes. DDG was nominated for it last year and he was what 24?

5354~~~
Should be 23 or under at the start of the season.

5355~~~
Anyways isn't Lukaku already the strongest contender for the PFA Young player award.

5356~~~
13 goals and 7 assists in a team that's been pretty poor going forward, that's a really good return.

5357~~~
Kane walks YPOTY unfortunately.

5358~~~
I do worry that he is playing too much. Who would have thought when we signed him he would already have 40 appearances for Manchester United in one season.

5359~~~
I love his movement and his dribbling ability especially in tight areas.  One area of improvement is shooting from longer range.  If he has that in his arsenal, he could a really special player.

5360~~~
His touch sometimes lets him down as well at crucial times as well. He could have had a few more goals if he was able to take the ball well when sent clear. This is probably just me nitpicking but I have definitely noticed this happening four-five times.

5361~~~
Our lack of attacking options meant he would have played a lot of matches if not 40. That's when we hadn't even accounted for Lingard or Rashford.

5362~~~
Imagine him with RVP's shooting technique! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5363~~~
Yes. Easily to be fair to the guy.

5364~~~
Not sure I've noticed much of that. More a case of him running out steam after making driving/dribbling runs into the box due to having to get past too many defenders. Over time he'll learn to put the final touch to those moves or simply find a way to have to do less. But it only happens because he's capable of taking defences on.

5365~~~
Yes, i agree with you on this one.  That little backheel from Rashford that sent him clear until Stones came crashing in.  He could have just smash it through towards the goal rather than dribbling it into the box.  But why are we nitpicking this when his ability to reach a higher ceiling is there for us to see.

5366~~~
He wants to play as a striker so is there any point in signing a young striker like Kane or Lukaku for massive money? Okay Kane is looking like a fantastic player so if he is available then I think itd be hard to turn down but I do think it would hamper Martial.

5367~~~
I don't see why we can't bring in another young striker, barca fit  3 strikers in their system. On top of rotation, it's about the movement and flexibility of players. I think Martial definitely has what it takes to part of a fluid attack.

5368~~~
No they don't.

5369~~~
Kane, Alli and Lukaku are probably favourites - and no one is winning it by a landslide. Martial didn't have a season as good as theirs, he just showed enormous potential, but as far as YPOTY goes it should be one of those three

5370~~~
I have to agree with you. Suarez is the closest to Martial, Messi and Neymar aren't strikers.

5371~~~
I think Martial is still ahead of Alli. Agree about Kane and Lukaku though. Probably Kane will win it again as his goals have held more importance in PL Title Challenge

5372~~~

5373~~~
Not so sure, yet. I thought RvP would defo win the 12/13 award, yet Bale got it ahead of him.

If Martial continues this good run, you never know.

5374~~~
That's good company he's keeping. Hopefully he'd go onto emulate those three legends!

5375~~~
Incredible company! If he can reach Giggs/Cantona levels, we'll be back winning titles.

5376~~~
I think it's also a good achievement considering he has played out wide. Scoring 1 in 3 is decent all things considered, particularly considering his age and the fact the team have created so few chances this season.

I think had he played regularly up front he would be around the 20 goal mark around now. If he was playing for a team who could create chances then....who knows. Regardless he has been our most threatening outfield player this season by some distance. Considering his age and the environment he has come into that's quite a good achievement. Unfortunately for him may not even make top 3 YPOTY due to the outstanding seasons for Kane, Lukaku and Delle Ali.

5377~~~

5378~~~
Don't let the city fans see that!

5379~~~
If only THAT run had a goal scoring finish. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

5380~~~
I imagine he thinks he's made a huge mistake

5381~~~
Not his best game but he still has moments of brilliance where he can score a goal or create a chance out of nothing due to his perseverance.

5382~~~
Easy to forget he's only 20. The decision making will come.

5383~~~
He looks knackered, really needs a rest but who would replace him?

5384~~~
Completely burnt out.

On a completely unrelated note, Chicharito scored his 24th goal of the season today.

5385~~~
Thought the same myself today, and I bet Dave is praying RM come back in for him.

The rest are truly shambolic. We're miles off.

5386~~~
One man attack.

5387~~~
Yep. And the humiliating and sad thing about our current situation is I wouldn't blame him.

5388~~~
Looking forward to seeing how he does under Mourinho, especially if we bring in competent attackers to help him like Ibra <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> 
As of now, with LvG, the plan is basically give him the ball and hope he scores while everyone else hold your shape.

5389~~~
We kept him out wide and put Young up front <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He didnt have his best game, but he still created the only shot we had all game.

5390~~~
Only real piece of quality in our team other than De Gea.

Also, read his wife left him, is this true?

5391~~~
It's really frustrating we have to rely on his moments of brilliance for any semblance of attacking threat. It's so easy for teams to double and triple team him at times because Rojo never bothers to overlap and the one time Rojo did and had time to cross we only had Ashley bloody Young in the box.

5392~~~
Once again carrying our attack all on his own.

I bet he's having a joyous time, he's looked absolutely fecking exhausted recently.

5393~~~
Van Gaal seemed to imply martial not scoring a good chance with lots of space was the turning point. Let's forget that he made it entirely himself amongst a team so clueless we were just hitting the ball at him hoping he'd do something

5394~~~
Not his best game, but could have scored a magical goal. Looks like he either needs a game or two out, or a hell of a lot more support.

What's amazing is that our entire gameplan going forward seems to be to "give it to Martial". No quality through the middle. No quality from the right. No quality from the striker. Just give it to this and hope.

5395~~~
I am not seeing any genuine footballing chemistry between Rashford, Martial and Lingard. Our best attacking combo has been Mata, Rooney and Martial IMO.

5396~~~
I was absolutely livid just before he created our only chance. He got the ball out wide, and there were five players standing in a line in midfield, just behind him, showing absolutely no intent of offering him anything that resembled an outlet.

At the end he managed to create a chance out of it on his own, but for me that really summed up our game. Punt it to Martial, and hope he does something. It's a travesty, really. If you're him, you can't be blamed for starting to look for a way out after a season like this, because he's clearly cut out for a much higher level than we're offering him now.

5397~~~
He's so much better than everyone else it's embarrassing.

5398~~~
I've only read it in The Sun, so I don't know how true it is. The Sun were the only place who reported the original story including that X Factor bird as well, and nothing seemed to come of it after that, not in the media anyway.

5399~~~
I will say it here, Martial like the rest of the team has been average this season.

5400~~~
I think he was fortunate in his first few games that he didn't speak English and therefore it took longer for LVG's tactics to filter through to him via teammate translators - he was just playing on instinct.

5401~~~
That's harsh and you're not wrong, however, it's incredibly out of context. We've seen Martial play to his potential and consistently show that in spurts (that's an oxymoron but you know what I mean) show his class. How it produced consistent results? Nope but his 'average' is the least of our concerns and shouldn't really warrant a mention where the bigger problems are his team mates and sh|te tactics.

5402~~~
He has done about as well as any attacking player can in Van Gaal's system at United. He's had good periods and periods where he has been ineffective, but good on the whole, especially considering he was 19/20 in a new country/league and in a struggling team where the entire tactic is give him the ball and hope he does something.

5403~~~
That's true, the whole team has been average. When it's the odd player/s, then clearly you hold the player himself accountable. But when it's the entire team?

5404~~~
That's my point, I'm tired of seeing all the players being individually lambasted at the exception of the fans favorite. At the exception of De Gea all our players have been individually and collectively below par, CBJ is the other exception.

The players shouldn't be lambasted when we all know that a lot of the problems comes from the management.

5405~~~
Lord...

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/f51q" width="560"></iframe>

5406~~~
Well he had a very promising start to his career with us and shows something special every now and then but he has pretty much settled on the level of the rest of the team by now.

5407~~~
He needs to play more with his head up (he has a tendency to run into traffic) but fundamentally he looks knackered after playing so many games this season. Great squad management by yesterday's hero.

5408~~~
Put him back in the centre. Play Young, or dare I say It Memphis out wide.

5409~~~
Considering the context of Martial's move and the way we have played this season I find calling Martial average very strange indeed (unless you believe there is much more to come). He's not been consistently brilliant but he seems to make our most threatening contribution every single game even when overall he's been poor. For a guy that was supposed to be a panic buy and that was already written off before he came he has acquitted himself fantastically. In a team like ours every time he doesn't score a chance he will look worse off because its the only chance that sticks out. However it shouldn't be normal for the best chance of the game to be your left winger leaving 3 people for dead and not finishing as well as he could have. Part of me thinks Martial snatches a bit at chances because he's conscious of the fact that he might well not get another.

Clearly however with the talent Martial has at his disposal if we are being critical there are often situations where he should do better but I think in a more settled, offensive minded team he would also do better generally. Martial is rightly cut slack because firstly he is the only one who seems to show attacking intent and secondly no one really expected him to be such a permanent fixture within the team. There is more to come but he's been a rare shining light in a dire attacking season.

Next time you watch United pay attention to the attacking movement around Martial, it's genuinely shocking and disheartening. Rojo barely every gets on the overlap and Martial only really has the option to knock it into a forward or pass square to a stationary midfielder. When Martial does beat a man on the outside there tends to be very few numbers in the box to aim for. The only frustration with Martial is sometimes when he comes inside he takes a bit too long to decide what to do but I'm not sure if cutting inside and shooting is part of his game as much as it is for someone like Depay. There are definitely things to work on but there's no way I can bring him to the level of the rest of the squad, inept coaching or not our only hope in every game is Martial (and sometimes Rashford). In a way this is kind of reminiscent of Januzaj's breakthrough season but there is clearly a lot more end product and physicality in Martial's game.

5410~~~
There is no need to right essays about it, he has been average. I'm a huge fan and I was a fan way before the caf knew his existence but he has been average. He has a great potential and I have absolutely no doubt that he can become a top player.

Martial today looks like Martial 2 years ago, one good move in the game and then nothing.

5411~~~
His run at 60 minute was out of this world. One of the best pieces of football that I've seen in the whole season. Can't wait until he's mature enough to finish more of his chances, in 2 or 3 years he can (and hopefully will) be one of the best players in the league (and, who knows, maybe even the world?).

Some nice moves, even though being double and triple marked didn't help him, obviously. The turn when he left 2 players for dead was so Iniesta-esque <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Not a great performance, an average onee, actually, but still a very promising one

5412~~~
He hasn't been average, one of the few bright lights of our season. But it's worrying how much responsibility he is having to shoulder in our attack and if it goes on beyond this season it will be a concern for his development.

People labeling his seasons performance average. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He's a kid and he has lots of rough edges (running back into traffic and generally taking too much out of the ball among them) but with time, patience and a manager who can guide him he'll be a proper player. I do worry that the expectations of him at this point might prove to be damaging to him, though. He's basically being asked to carry a very average side.

5416~~~
I don't understand how you feel fans have been too harsh on players because of the coaching and then proceed to call Martial average, flying in the face of most opinions. You seem to want context for the rest of the players and none for Martial? Even if you know him better than most that's a strange way of going about things. He's 20, he cost a lot, he was written off and he carries our attack. More developed players like Di Maria and Depay have not even managed to settle.

5417~~~
behave. without him this year we'd be 10th

5418~~~
He has not been better than Di Maria, they have both been average, I don't blame him, I don't condemn him, I don't say that he is an average player, that he has an average potential, I say that his performances have been average like most of his teammates. In terms of creativity or finishing he hasn't been special, he showed that he has the talent but he has not exploited it.

Being average doesn't mean that he is shite and to be perfectly explicit I put all the blame on the staff.

5419~~~
I thought they were talking about this particular game? If not, then wow

5420~~~
I wouldn't say his season is average, but he's been playing on his own for some time and today it was an exaggeration. It's not a surprise that his best action (probably the only good one today) was that run where he dribbled half of their team. He relied everything on his dribble and he didn't try anything different, and it's not the first time it happens, nor the second.

Many times we play slow football against a parked bus and he has no chance of doing anything, so he has an excuse for me. But today there was room to play faster and take profit of spaces, and he ruined many actions by keeping the ball too much, or facing a wall of defenders when a fast and simple pass to a more uncongested zone would have been much more productive.

He needs to read games and situations better and use some different tools, and he has showed before that he's able to do it, even when we are shit as a team. It's true he's played a lot of games, but he didn't look tired in that run where he nearly scored, or missing his wife or anything. And he was pressing at the end of the match with energy, so I don't buy any excuses today. He's a massive talent and he can play much better than this.

5421~~~
He might be average for his standards but relative to the rest of the team he's been much better, even when he does not play well like today he's still the most likely to make anything happen. There's a huge difference between Martial's persistence amidst a shower of shite and Di Maria's gutless displays at the end of last season, irrespective of who the coach is. It's this difference that means fans cut Martial slack. 

I think it's unfair to put in him in the same category as his teammates, we've scored 71 goals in 50 games this season it appears, 20 of them have had direct contributions from Martial. In our first 6 games without him we scored 10 goals. He then played some part in every game from Liverpool at home on Sept 12 to Watford away on Nov 21, where we scored 2 goals. Martial then played every match up until the Midjytlland game at home where we scored 5 and the Arsenal game at home after where we scored 3. He's played every game since. From my back of the cig paper calculations, in the games Martial has played (41) we have scored 51 goals, he has contributed to 20 of those which is 39.2%. That is a lot for an average contribution. 

Sidebar: The Brugge and Midjytlland games skew the goals scored without Martial quite heavily (12), otherwise it's 8 goals in 6 games which is closer to type so you can nip that 'we're better without him in the team' hot take in the bud and if anyone can be arsed here's the links for those calcs and I'm off to write my dissertation, good night all:

5422~~~
He's done as well as you could really expect anyone too with this style of football and considering how young he is. He's been one of our best outfield players defiantly.

5423~~~
I keep saying it, Van Gaal should have built the team to extract the most of Martial. Leave Martial 1-1 Vs anyone and he will beat them more often than not.

5424~~~
I dont get this at all.

What were you expecting of Martial this season? Surely he's exceeded expectations.

5425~~~
I can only assume he's a WUM, it's just such utter nonsense to call him average this season when he has been quite easily our best outfield player, our top scorer and is 20 years old.

5426~~~
Indeed.

5427~~~
I can understand <a class="username" data-user="84732, @JPRouve" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84732/">@JPRouve</a> 's point. Seeing him at Monaco last year you could expect a more consistent threat and more end product from him.

Of course you can't blame him, he's been overplayed and it's hard for anyone to shine in that team.

5428~~~
He only played four full games for Monaco last season. Moving to a different country at a young age, to a better standard of football, what kind of end product did you expect from him?

Describing Martial as average this season is one of the craziest things I've seen on here.

5429~~~
The thing that sticks out is that he still manages to have more moments of quality than any other player we have or have had in the past couple of seasons basically. None of the senior, better paid players are managing the impact he has had even if it's not ultimately up to what he is capable of, because we as a team are in such a state. When we have an actual good team around him then we'll surely see him shine.

5430~~~
Very true. Was quite quiet today, but he had that brilliant moment where he was able to burst through three or four defenders and nearly scored. He's a constant threat, and by far the most dangerous outfield player in the team right now.

5431~~~
He should have shot across the goalkeeper instead of trying to be clever and reverse the shot. It needed a finish similar to his debut goal. That's usually his go to finish, so I was amazed when he reverted to something different.

Had he scored, it would have been one of the goals of the season. He completely took four Spurs players out of the game with that run.

5432~~~
Calling his season average is one of the stranger things I've read here. Even stranger coming from a decent poster.

5433~~~
In what world has Martial been average? That's as mental as calling Rojo a good player. 

If we hadn't signed him,  this season might have just about finished me off.

5434~~~
Calling Martial's season average is OTT. His stats are average but they do not tell the whole truth by far. 

Still, there is a tendency on this forum to highlight only the good sides of Martial's game and to turn a blind eye to its weaknesses by explaining them away with LVG's inept tactics or the lack of quality in the team. 

Yesterday he had one absolutely brillliant run but apart from that he was dogshit. 

Maybe he has played too many games this season, maybe he is trying to do too much on his own, maybe he has to learn when it is good to retain the ball and dribble and when it is better to release it quickly. Cruyff said about 10 years ago that Messi should learn when it makes sense to dribble and when he has to pass the ball if he wants to become a truly great player. Martial is still very young though. A new manager, new tactics, new team mates will help him to develop further.

5435~~~
Maybe I'm wrong but I'm not impressed by his performances at all. He has regressed or at the very least stagnated this season, the only thing that he improved is his left foot. Maybe I'm harsh and it's true that he is our best attacking player but our attaack is absolutely wank, our attack is around Monaco's and it's a terrible attack this season.

5436~~~
To be fair to the lad, he is working with 0. More or less when he got the ball he had to try and take on the whole Spurs defense by himself, especially when Rashford went off. Anytime he attempted to link play with the other attacking players they lost the ball.
Don't think he played well, however its difficult to do that in those circumstance I think.

5437~~~
I completely agree.

5438~~~
I know what you mean, but he's a one man attack atm. no supply from midfield whatsoever, he's expected to carry the ball past 2-3 defenders everytime and that's just not realistic. He also looks absolutely knackered, doubt we were expecting to play him as much as we have.

5439~~~
Rumours his wife has gone back to France and they have split due to her being homesick....

5440~~~
That's what living in Manchester does to women who are used to decent cities.

5441~~~
I think Martial has been a bit average since he returned from injury, but I wouldn't label his entire season average. But I did not watch him at Monaco.

He's played far too many games and has been asked to lead our attack. Let's see how he does next season in a better functioning team hopefully.

5442~~~
They have a kid, I call bollocks...

5443~~~
Probably caus of him shagging around if anything.

5444~~~
This. I don't get how he's been average. He moved from the French league at 19 years old and immediately became our best attacker by a country mile, received the Golden Boy award and is rightfully regarded as one of the best and most talented young players in the world. He's mostly been playing on the left, yet he's got 13 goals and 7 assists and if his teammates weren't so fecking useless, the stats would have been even more impressive. He's had some quiet games, but who doesn't? Especially at 19-20. 

I guess he's average for having to come up against 2-3 opponents every time he touches the ball as our tactics are something along the lines of "pass it to Martial and stand still like utter morons." Funny thing is - he doesn't always come out of situations like that with the ball, but he still does quite often and it's fecking magical. His run yesterday brought a smile to my face and it's not the first time he's done it either. 

Maybe people were expecting Messi when we signed him. In that case, yeah, he's been average.

5445~~~
He's constantly offered the only bright spots in our games. His consistency has gone down some but he's also played almost every game the entire season.

LVG blaming him for the Spurs loss is insanity, he creates a chance (the only real chance) all on his own and gets criticized for not scoring. I guess he would've been better off just not creating a chance in the first place? Seems that would've been better in LVG's mind anyway.

5446~~~
He needs to improve shooting and he hopefully will because that is his main weakness so far and something he hasn't changed since Monaco. It's not powerful and not precise enough at the moment.

5447~~~
Home sick even though France is a 1.2 hour flight? Jesus.. it takes me that exact time to get from my Home house to my college house and not by first class <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5448~~~
The rumour is apparently false.

5449~~~
She is in France right now (or somewhere else warm) according to her Instagram at least.

5450~~~
Martial has been closer to world class than he has to average! A shining light in a terrible season. the supply and movement in this team is some of the worst I've ever seen and yet martial still produces at least a chance a game.

5451~~~
According to rumours, Martial went with another girl on some date and shagged her as well, apparently they've removed their photo's where they are together on Instagram as well. There seems to be some truth in it.

5452~~~
Ffs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5453~~~
They've definitely removed pictures of each other on Instagram.

5454~~~
He has not had an average season if we're assessing expectations realistically. The way he's played has given us hope that he's going to be a world class player, but some are now reassessing his season by those exacting standards, which is unfair.

He has consistently been the only bright spot in our games, and seems to be the only player that actually makes something happen. Our game plan is basically get the ball to Martial and hope he does the rest. It's a testament to his quality and impact this season, but it's also hindering the player himself. He cannot and shouldn't be the only attacking outlet.

5455~~~
Agreed

5456~~~
If I was a 19 year old millionaire I wouldn't be that mad to settle down with a family either.

5457~~~
Giggsy taught him well.

Players get married too young because they are often advised by managers and old pros to settle down young and focus on their game.

It's a good idea in theory, but leaves them open to a possible crucification when they stray from home or step out of line.

They should stay single and bang as many as these escorts, models and socialites for as long as they want until they're nearing the end of their playing days.

Defoe has been with every girl in London and still had a good career. He wasn't harassed over it either.

5458~~~
They split because he apparently shagged some bird from the X factor

5459~~~
Everytime I try to take an interest in the players personal life, I end up angry and confused.

5460~~~
Doesn't quite look right tonight to me. Is it just me? It's strange.

5461~~~
I think it's true, she changed her instagram handle from samantha_martial to samantha_helena.

5462~~~
Think he's been average lately. Quite wasteful, overdribbles too often. It's clear he feels like he has to carry the team. Admittedly that has been the case quite a few times but nonetheless, with Rooney coming back, maybe he could do with a couple of games on the bench just to wake him up a bit.

5463~~~
Two assists <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5464~~~
9 Assists in total. Yikes.

5465~~~
I feel I must bge watching someone else as I think he's been good the last couple of games and was good tonight with 2 assists, I think his performance went up a notch when he moved central and was acting as a false 9, feeding in Lingard and Rashford, he's forming a good understanding with the latter.

5466~~~
He's not quite fine tuned at the moment. He's always a threat but his sharpness is costing him even more goals and assists.

He did well overall though. Basically 2 assists and was unlucky not to score himself.

I do worry about the amount of games he's played this season, with Euro 2016 still to come.

5467~~~
Think Villa would be the perfect game to rest him tbh.

5468~~~
21 goals/assists in his first season where he's had to carry the attack, in 42 appearances. 

Great first season. Under a better manager next year he could close to double that I think.

5469~~~
Done very well in a team with very little attacking threat imo. Happy he seems more greedy. Needs to shoot some more. Would have been ridiculous if he scored against Spurs after that run. Needs to do more of that.

5470~~~
Should rest him a bit. He's played a lot.

5471~~~
I think he might have scored today if he'd gotten a pass on a couple of counters. Good positioning at LW on those, but the reverse ball wasn't played. 

How many players in the world would you swap him for, considering his age? 

I think he'd be #3 on my value list behind <b>Neymar</b> (24 and damn near a goal a game from LW, also carries Brazil) and <b>Messi</b> (28 but I think he'll be a brilliant CM/10 once he's 32-33 and can't play wide anymore) and just ahead of <b>Pogba</b> (similar, but far more potential than Koke, though he's also filled with Gallic ennui which might concern me), <b>Verratti</b> (can play as a 6 or as an 8, has 10+ years left and is incredible) and <b>Koke</b> (24, so maybe 9-10 more years of top CM play). <b>De Bruyne</b> loses points for being a 10 (have to build around him to get the best out of him and can't really play a normal 4-3-3, whereas the first 4 names fit any formation perfectly) and <b>Alaba</b> loses points since fullbacks are sometimes cheap enough that you might be able to replace 80% of what he gives you a bit easier. But he's got 10 years of greatness left too. 

I think that's the first tier when you look at age + production, unless I'm missing someone. Seems wrong to have no Germans named.

5472~~~
I do think he flatters to deceive some times and could be more effective but then I remember his age and cut him some slack, not his fault we spent a fortune on him.

5473~~~
It was frustrating wasn't it. Whenever he gets the ball he is usally marked by two, but during the few occasions he has acres of space Herrera fecks up a simple pass, Lingard doesn't look up and passes to Rashford who was running in a far worse shooting angle and Fellaini does the same as Lingard not much later.

5474~~~
I'm just happy we seem to have a wide goalscorer again. Haven't since Ronaldo left. Arsenal went damn near 10 trophyless years without one between Pires getting old and Sanchez arriving. Spurs haven't had one in the history of the Prem.

5475~~~
Will get double figures goals and assists before the season is done. For most of the season, he was the only player teams bothered to mark.

5476~~~
Considering that he never had a pre-season with us, his age, being in a new country and the shit that he has played alongside in addition to, as you say, a deranged manager who shifted him around he has done very well.

5477~~~
I'd love to, but you just can't not play him. He takes two defenders or at least a defender and a winger tracking back out the game! You can't say the same about Depay who would replace him!

5478~~~
He's been average this season according to some.

5479~~~
His wife have now dropped the Martial name from her Instagram account.

Edit: Oh, beaten to it.

5480~~~
He has been, what he has done this season is half of what he is able to do.

5481~~~
I don't think hes been average tbh, I think he has just not had the support around him. Its obvious he has a lot more in his locker though

5482~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5483~~~
No it has nothing to do with the support, his striking technique his average and he stopped improving his runs and positioning. Obviously people are satisfied by his performances since he is a lot more talented than anyone else in our roster but it doesn't mean that he is having a good season, by his standards that's an average season.
And lets be clear I'm not blaming him, I'm just judging his evolution and the quality of his individual performances.

5484~~~
I agree on his striking technique. The thing with the runs and positioning for me is that his team mates are not helping him, he is the creative outlet in the team so he keeps coming to get the ball to make things happen, instead of making runs. Watching him for France he seems to make a lot more runs off the ball (where he knows his team mates will find him)

5485~~~
Gareth Bale might dispute this

5486~~~
That's why I wish we'd give Mata a sustained run as the #10 with Lingard on the right and Rashford up front. Not 2-3 games or a half.

5487~~~
You keep mentioning his standards. He was 19 when he arrived, having only played four full games in a weaker league the previous season. These "standards" don't really exist. He like all young players is an ever changing work in progress.

5488~~~
Sherringham too?

5489~~~
Haha. I totally forgot. Bale definitely qualifies. Change Spurs to Liverpool? McManaman only topped 7 goals in one of his 7 seasons and nobody else comes to mind.

5490~~~
Kuyt mainly played on the right didn't he?

5491~~~
I think Gerrard also scored 20 from RM once.

5492~~~
On 2nd look, Bale only topped 9 goals once in the league, so while he was a good goalscoring threat, the fact that they played him on the left instead of on the right probably meant he created more goals for others with crosses but he wasn't exactly banging them in until his final season as Spurs, where he played centrally too but scored wherever he was deployed.

5493~~~
Martial hasn't been that amazing as he was a few months ago, there is no denying that, but that is partly due to teams now using 2 players on him. Although, there are no excuses for some not so good finishing. Makes me wonder why don't we hire someone like Van Nistelrooy as one of our coaches. Let him earn his badges here instead of PSV

5494~~~
i hope we rest him vs Villa, he needs it.

5495~~~
I'm not sure I'd class him as that just yet. I mean he's only got 8 prem goals and I'm pretty sure only 4 of those were from wide? 

He's young though so that's not bad. It just shows LvG/club were really short sighted in not getting another proven attacking threat in to support him, no matter how much potential he has.

5496~~~
Anybody notice how deep his collecting the ball now and how He's being asked to 'knit the play'....?

5497~~~
Too true, it weirdly reminds me of Welbeck's.

5498~~~
Almost got a quality assist for Memphis, great footwork to create the opening and a neat pass. The rest will have done him good.

5499~~~
He needed a bit of rest, good decision.

5500~~~
Strictly speaking, he did get a rest somewhat since we had a game and he wasn't starting. Reality is it will have been a normal week between his next game and that's not much is it seeing as usually we play every week.

Certainly not going to rejuvenate him after having played nearly every game since he joined us.

5501~~~
I know the MEN is a piece of trash for most stuff, but found <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-uniteds-anthony-martial-makes-11193897" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this</a> admission by Martial interesting and smart at the same time. I think quickness, agility and mobility are much more important for him going forward. Memphis, to me, is the prime example of too much added muscle weight having gone wrong.

5502~~~
Was happy he was rested. Given the game was kinda hoping he would have the whole game to rest.

Hopefully he gets a few more games to rest in before next season.

5503~~~
Finally got a bit of a rest. Pretty sure he has played every game he has been fit for since signing which is a bit ridiculous considering his age. He has seemed tired in recent weeks and less effective then earlier in the season... Though that could just be him being vangled.

One thing I will need to criticize him for is that he has seemed less and less interested and motivated on the pitch as the season has wore on. Like he looks like he knows he is the only player for us who can do something attacking wise on the pitch, and he is getting more and more frustrated. He still works hard defensively and all that though so fair play to him, and you can't blame him too much because of our overall style and tactics and how everyone else is basically useless in attack. But there is still a clear attitude difference between the start of the season when he came and now, and I'm not sure it helps his development as there is nothing pushing him on to be better. 

That's why we seriously need to bring in top class quality, someone like Ibra, or a top right winger, so Martial has someone to compete with to be the top guy here, and push him on to improve. Right now, there is nobody close, and he's only 20, so it could easily make him complacent (if it hasn't a little already).

Yep. In fact I was kinda thinking that he looked a decent amount bigger then he did at the start of the season and I'm not sure if that helped his agility.

5504~~~
I thought he looked a bit frustrated tonight and I think he needs to make more runs into the box when the ball is on our right.

5505~~~
Very good first half, but didn't have many chances to have an impact after he was moved centrally.

5506~~~
I think he was frustrated with himself.

5507~~~
I thought that as well; I wonder if he could do with a bit of a proper rest as he's played a lot this season.

5508~~~
That left footed shot was pretty unlucky, he struck it with fair venom. Yeh he could have gone abit wider or on the ground but was still a very good stop from speroni. Overall tho, it wasn't his best showing but I can let him off as long as he tears Everton apart this weekend.

5509~~~
He had a good game but certainly needs to do a bit of shooting practice for scenarios where he can't cut inside so just has to drill it with his left, he had a few in the game which he couldn't make the most out of, the most promising thing is that he is getting the chances though and is always a threat.

5510~~~
It's obvious he's working on his shooting. When he first came, he simply refused to shoot. Still the part of his game that needs to most work.

5511~~~
Fortunately, improving their final ball or shooting is at the top of the improvement list for nearly all young forwards.  He's got everything else (other than aerial aggression which should improve given his height).

5512~~~
Not his best game, but still a joy to watch. Young and Lernin.

5513~~~
Yeah, finishing wasn't really there but was a threat as usual.

5514~~~
It's a shame we can't create more chances for him to help improve his shooting

5515~~~
Between Martial and Rashford, who do you think has been better as the main striker?

5516~~~
The guy is clearly tired its honestly ridiculous that hes had to play this many games. Then he has the Euros in the summer, no rest at all for the lad.

5517~~~
I fear for him. This is like Wenger overplaying one of his talented young players to completely burn him out.

Like you said, with the amount he has played this season and the Euros, where France will surely go a long way, we are likely to see a huge drop in performance from this guy next season.

5518~~~
Yep and I'd argue that we've already started seeing the drop in his performances. The last few games he has been very average sprinkled with quality which shows a play who is struggling to keep their level. Theres clearly times where he gets the ball with space and would normally go for the defenders but around the 60minute mark he is dead on his feet and just waits for support to pass it round.

5519~~~
Martial has been better coming in off the left than playing as a striker, Rashford better upfront so it works out fine.

5520~~~

Funny how they left out the part about Wenger <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5522~~~
Anyone who thinks he has been average should never watch football again. He has been our best player after DDG.

5523~~~
It was mentioned he's had some average games which is fair enough. He's looked knackered recently.

5524~~~
I don't disagree - he needs to be given rest, & far too much responsibility is on him. He's also had a few games where he has made too many bad decisions (like any young player will). That said, he has outperformed everyones' expectations (bar those on this website, of course) and has won us several games in his debut season, all at the age of 20. If anyone thinks he has been at the same level as Lingard, Depay, Mata etc (that is the definition of average, being the same standard as everyone else), surely they need to have their head checked.

5525~~~
This is actually a. Big worry.

5526~~~
Red Cafe is quoted in the media now?

Thanks again <a class="username" data-user="41920, @Dan" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/41920/">@Dan</a>. You posted the one from shamans last week, right?

5532~~~
Yeah, not sure how long they've been taking quotes from here as i've only started getting the i on a Saturday since The Independent stopped being printed.

5533~~~
Utter wonderkid. Such a joy to watch when he's on fire.

5534~~~
He's almost going into De Gea territory in regards to brilliance being the usual.

5535~~~
Already proving himself to be a big game player. Can't wait for his prime, hopefully at United<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5536~~~
Unreal talent

5537~~~
Fantastic.

5538~~~
Feel for Besic. Been schooled.

5539~~~
Have to laugh at some of our Liverpool posters calling this guy overrated. He's easily the best young talent in Europe right now.

5540~~~
Hes absolutely up for this game and hes at his very best.

5541~~~
So good

5542~~~
Should have scored, other than that fantastic.

5543~~~
He's the closest player to having Ronaldo-like potential that we've had since Viva left the building.

<a class="username" data-user="7174, @SirAF" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/7174/">@SirAF</a>

5544~~~
Him, Rashford and Lingard have linked up very well.

5545~~~
Rooney and Lingard has been very good in the first half but this guy is just on another level, he just oozes class. He will become a very special player in a couple of years.

5546~~~
Pure magic. He's so incredibly complete.

5547~~~
Will be the best player in the league, inside the next 18 months.

5548~~~
The skill was wonderful but his tracking back is very impressive. He's done it well all season.

5549~~~
Wouldn't say he's complete yet, still has work to do on his finishing. For his age though, he's as complete as it gets.

5550~~~
Absolute class.

5551~~~
Great talent, I cannot wait to see him mature and look (sometimes) less clumsy on the ball. I'm not criticizing him, it's just that at times it seems like he decides at the last moment what he's going to do and it can look awkward.

5552~~~
Sorry, that's what I mean. His base skillset is incredibly complete. There's very little he doesn't have in his game, or hasn't shown this season. One of the most complete young footballers I've seen.

5553~~~
Yeah it does look somewhat awkward, but his close control is quite supreme. Something that only the top dribblers have.

5554~~~
I think the only thing he has looked a little weak at is his choice of shot, or not getting a shot away at all, especially around the edge of the box. If he can start cutting in and lashing shots across the keeper, he'll be among the best forwards around.

5555~~~
Man Oh man..... 

This kid is fantastic. If he only smiled.... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5556~~~
He's a winger in my eyes leave him there throughout his career

5557~~~
Its way to early to say that, while he looks at his best out left currently, i still think he will develop into a beastly striker.

5558~~~
Definitely could be right. He's just amazing

5559~~~
Yes!!!!!!

5560~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5561~~~
Worth whatever the feck we paid.

5562~~~
Dave and Martial - the Man Utd XI

5563~~~
He is soooo talented.

5564~~~
Martial <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5565~~~
He is magical.

5566~~~
Could have paid three times that. Wouldn't have cared at this point.

Without him and Dave we would have sunk without trace on all fronts.

5567~~~
Are you shitting me? What a run! What a fecking run in the 92nd minute after running his arse off the entire game.

My poor heart! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5568~~~
What a positive fecker, always want to attack, gotta love players like him!

5569~~~
The kid is absolutely spectacular. What a huge huge moment

5570~~~
What a player.

5571~~~
What a fecking player

5572~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> Brilliantly taken goal. Showed Lukaku up big time!

5573~~~
He is so clutch. I kept saying, "Sub him, he's injured", and then he does something like that in the last minute. Pure magic. Bliss.

5574~~~
He's a genius. Knew he was going to score

5575~~~
One game's rest leads to that!

5576~~~
Reminds me so much of brazilian Ronaldo when young, brilliant player in the making! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5577~~~
I love him. No idea where we would be without him.

5578~~~
Great goal and great assist today. I can proudly say that I've always known and believed he was better attacking from the left than as a pure striker.

5579~~~
Lukaku should take note. Fantastic performance, shat on Besic all game.

5580~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/B6rvI90.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/B6rvI90.png"/>

5581~~~
Rinsed that right back.

5582~~~
The new "you don't win anything with kids".

5583~~~
Lets be honest, as soon as he cut in on his right foot at that angle you just KNEWWWWW the back of the net would ripple. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5584~~~
That flick earlier and the blocked overhead was also pretty incredible.

5585~~~
Beats players for fun. feck sake. Another 2 of him in attack and we'll have world beaters.

5586~~~
Magical player It's only a question of time before we have to pay Monaco that Ballon D'or clause.

5587~~~
Superb playmaking as well to start that move, he's done the same sort of give and go a few times and it can be very hard to defend against

5588~~~
Overrated ? Shut the feck up.

5589~~~
You beauty!!!!!!!!! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5590~~~
What a fecking player! He destroyed one more Everton right back after Coleman at Goodison and seems like he really likes to shit on this team in particular.

5591~~~
What a player and what a goal. Absolute class.

5592~~~
One of the very best risks that this club has done and well worth it

5593~~~
Amazing game and deserved hero, when he plays with tension he's unstoppable.

5594~~~
What a performance today and what a moment of beauty it was that he scored the winner in that manner.

5595~~~
This will never be forgotten!

Martial is a fantastic player, and the best signing we have made since De Gea.

5596~~~
Pay any amounts of money for moments like that. Can't wait to see him in a couple of years he's gunna be unplayable!

5597~~~
Great goal. Great player. Actually relieved for him as he seems to have been very frustrated with all the fluffed chances hes had.

5598~~~
Stunning performance. Stunning goal.

He's absurdly good.

5599~~~
Will be the best player in the Prem soon imo

What a player

5600~~~
Exactly what I said. Super talent.

5601~~~
What a player. He's 20? Depressing, ridiculous and scary.

5602~~~
Will be interesting when Shaw comes back and he doesn't have a donkey overlapping him.

5603~~~
Those moments where he gets the ball on the wing and just stops for half a second before going on a run inwards - they're magical. You just know something great is about to happen.

5604~~~
Love the celebration after the goal. Immensely talented and worth every penny

5605~~~
Insanely good. Ripped them to shreds.

5606~~~
He has the mentality to go along with the talent, Ronaldo-like if I may say so. What a player.

5607~~~
Swoon. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5608~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/wo2f" width="560"></iframe>

5609~~~
That's almost as good as it gets. What a moment.

5610~~~
For feck sake, he's just so good. Dream signing. Build the bloody team around him!

5611~~~
Reminds me of Messi when he does that. Today's goal was like that. No ones getting in my way. Off  I go to score my goal.

5612~~~
World class performance. Best outfield player on the pitch.

5613~~~
Love him..the only worry is can we keep him.

5614~~~
Only watched that ten times over.

5615~~~
Trade mark goal from Martial.

5616~~~
We need to build a world class attack around this kid, he's Ballon d'or talented.

5617~~~
It's amazing, we paid a fortune for him, he's still only 20, and this could be a valid worry.....

5618~~~
He is fecking immense.

What. A. Player.

5619~~~
Not worried about losing him yet. He'd only sit on the bench at Barca, Madrid etc.

5620~~~
Best 60m we've ever spent. Build everything around him.

5621~~~
Not so sure with the stars of those clubs getting older....I'm not being pessimistic, but christ...where does he want to end up. In Champions League football with a chance of getting in the team, or having no chance in a team that doesn't get to that level.

5622~~~

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5625~~~
It could be a worry in the future. 

But I don't see why people need to bring this up all the time. let's live in the now. He's here now.

5626~~~
Involved in 24 goals this season - 10 assisted, and 14 his own. 
A 20 year old kid. In his first season in the PL. 
Playing for Manchester United. 
As the main man. 

Wow.

5627~~~
In the next four years, he'll be the best in the world.

5628~~~
He just keeps upping his worth, he was dangerous all match and assisted Fellaini's goal, but to do that in the last minute of an FA Cup semi final, to make it and score it with such aplomb......Magic Martial! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

5629~~~
it's all the more meaningful when you realize we scored so few goals this season.

this signing turned out to be better than I had ever imagined.

5630~~~
Magic. Love seeing full backs shit it when he picks the ball up wide left. His potential is unlimited.

Also love that after all the stick the he and the club got during that international break before his debut, all the red tops saying he was a waste of money, and ex-pro columnists predicting he would flop before even seeing him kick a ball purely because they hadn't heard of him, I love that he's sticking two fingers up at the lot of them, and has been doing all season.

5631~~~
He raises his hands to Rooney saying give me the ball. Then he gets it and starts a nice 1-2 and finishes it off like that in extra time.

5632~~~
I cannot stop re-watching his goal<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> God he's something really special....

Loved how he celebrated with the fans as well.

5633~~~
As long as we have him on a long term contract, we shouldn't sell. I hope the club learned a lesson after selling Ronaldo.

5634~~~
A legend in the making.

5635~~~
What a player, must be a nightmare to play against.

5636~~~
I have complete trust on our scouts. They decided not to go for otamendi and pedro and decided to buy him. Knight them.

5637~~~
I seem to remember arguing against someone at the start of the season who though he was poor value compared to Sterling. 

Hindsight is great, of course, but still. I'll take Tony.

5638~~~
Well, that's it isn't it...contracts mean absolutely shite when a player really wants to go. I'm just saying, a player of that talent has dreams, the same as Ronaldo did. It would be interesting to know what his dream team is? The team he dreamed of playing for was. We all know Ronaldo's...what is/was Martials

5639~~~
Absolute class, we should be building teams around this guy for the foreseeable future he's going to be one of the worlds best. Him and Shaw linking up down the left is going to be unstoppable.

5640~~~
PES-esque goal. Finished off with a finesse shot. Brilliant. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5641~~~
He is brilliant.

5642~~~
I don't think he's going anywhere anytime soon. What was Henrys when he was winning not much with Arsenal? So not everyone really cares or thinks like that. The fact is, we made a decision to have a younger squad so that's good in a sense. They can all grow together. Ronaldo was a different issue all together. It was just ironic he turned down clubs - include those in Spain to sign for us - seeing as he wanted that environment. I wouldn't worry about Martial.

5643~~~
feck off with the transfer talk. Can't we just enjoy this magnificent talent playing for us? He's 20 Ffs

Btw loved that he demanded the ball.

5644~~~
He is the Iceman

5645~~~
Even if we win the FA Cup, the fact that we signed this guy will still be the biggest positive I'll take from this season. Nice to have <i>really</i> top class talent in the team.

5646~~~
This. fecking this.

First moment of absolute joy in this season for United and people are talking about him leaving. FFS.

5647~~~
He'll be one of the best players in the world. Frighteningly good.

5648~~~
Just got back from the game. He was amazing!!!

5649~~~
He's too good. Fantastic play for the game, dragged us out of a hole and into the final.

5650~~~
Tony Martial came from France
The English press said he had no chance
50m down the drain
As Anthony Martial scores again!

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5651~~~
Everything about that 30 seconds was beautiful, raising his arms and demanding the ball from the captain who is in a similar position because he wants to win it, the link up play, and the way he staggered his run when Herrera fell showed good awareness, top class finesse finish, and then that unreal celebration! Who thought he would top the Liverpool moment.

5652~~~
The biggest compliment I can give him is that after 8 months the £60m or so we shelled out for an unproven teenager is absolutely 100% worth it, without a shadow of a doubt. Genius.

5653~~~
Benefitted first half from Everton's bizarre decision to give Besic no support at all defensively. Found it a lot more difficult second half when Gibson started doubling up on him, but then popped up with a great goal. Love the guy so much!

5654~~~
If he had connected with that overhead kick...

5655~~~
He did didn't he? I thought it was blocked

5656~~~
Yeah, he did. Not sure what he's on about.

5657~~~
Ah, I thought it went just past his foot. 

Anyone got a replay?

5658~~~
would sign him all over again in the summer <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> .

There is so much more joy in buying these sleeper style signings than buying higher profile established signings. Really have to hand it to lvg and the scouts for getting him in.

5659~~~
not long before Real come knocking of you ask me.

5660~~~
Where has this notion come from that he was invisible in the second half until the goal? He should have had another assist for his dribble into the box and pass to fellaini who got his shot blocked by jagielka with his hands, he went past his markers at least akother three times (one time brilliantly with that heel flick) and put in dangerous crosses on all three counts where our players were inches away from tapping in. He did a nice backheel one touch pass for Lingard to have a free shot at goal as well. 

Hope An all touch youtube compilation of this match gets made soon for Martial so we can rewatch and compare his two halves. He was actually more consistent and less prone to losing the ball in the second half.

5661~~~
The feckers can knock as much as they like, they're not getting him. I think we should get rid of that paranoid stuff and just enjoy watching our talents. Just because Ronaldo dreamt of playing for Madrid doesn't mean everyone does and we're going to lose every world class player we have. Once we get our shit together, there won't even be a slight worry.

5662~~~
I think they would potentially have to pay a world record fee to get him. He is quite possibly the best 20 or under player in the world

5663~~~
Not long before I come knocking with a baseball bat straight onto those wretched "martial ganna leave, madrid and barca to pounce la" posts typing ratfingers of yours everytime he has a good game.

5664~~~
A baseball bat? You must be a pussy to hide behind one of those. And I never said he'd leave, but without a doubt they will be interested and most prob will come knocking. Do you not think so?

5665~~~
FFS!  We are not some Mickey Mouse club. The guy just a few weeks ago said he wants to spend many years here. We paid €80m for him. Madrid can't afford him unless he runs down his contract which still has 4 years to run. Get a grip. 
You don't hear Spurs fans fretting about Kane.

5666~~~
Real Madrid can piss off if they come knocking. I wouldn't sell Martial for any amount of $$$. Tired of them swooping in for our players.

5667~~~
I do once it is time. In three years maybe we can not hold onto him. But to repeat it like a broken record as you have done several times over a longer period of time whenever people are happy with his great performance reminds me of those very old and ugly people I know who are always depressed and miserable.

5668~~~
lol the last few years have driven some folks potty. I wish they would just zip it.

5669~~~
Are you mistaking me for someone else?? I have never mentioned Real coming knocking for him before?

5670~~~
<b>On matchwinner Anthony Martial</b>
"He could have scored in the first half when he was in the same situation, so I told him at half-time to shoot low into the corner – and he did that!"

Another one of those "the player scored or did this and that because of my advice" post match comments <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5671~~~
Nah I'm far from potty mate, just being realistic. I'd be amazed if the likes of Real doesn't come knocking eventually. I'm not saying he'd leave, and I hope to feck he is with us for many years to come, but they will try.

5672~~~
Oh ok. There is this one mong in this thread who has been on and on about real and barca coming to knock knock for him for the best part of the season. Excuse me.

5673~~~
I'm sure Martial wouldn't have scored without Van Gaal's half time guidance <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5674~~~
Fair dos, we'll move on. No harm done. My post about Real was more of a worry tbh, cause I love everything about him atm.

5675~~~
Typical Vangle.

5676~~~
Oh shut up LVG, we won because no one listened to you and they played instinctively

5677~~~
Don't think I said he was invisible second half, just that he wasn't involved as much as he was first half. Not a criticism, just an observation.

5678~~~
It's not everyones dream. They can try all they like but what will happen is the media will lie at some point because people make it easy to create a story. Let's just enjoy the moment and forget the rest.

5679~~~
don't believe I said it was <i>his </i>dream.

5680~~~
Average season my arse

He's fecking ace

5681~~~
All things considered, isn't he just the most magical fecker?

5682~~~
14 goals and 10 assists for a 20 year old playing on the wing in his first season is an outstanding return.

5683~~~
God I love our scouts for recommending his signing and for LVG and Woody going out there and getting it signed and sealed.

5684~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Becoming as frequent as Wenger's "we could have signed him but decided not too" spiel.

5685~~~
Just saw this comment on Martial's performance under a Guardian facebook post:

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5686~~~
Henry-esque goal but the shot itself had some solid power in it. No chance for Howard to reach that.

Sings of maturity are there and looks like he's being raised as an attacking winger.

5687~~~
What a player. I havent celebrated a goal like that since I was at Old Trafford for his debut. And it was pretty similar with his composure.

The dude is ace, only 20. I know hes going to the Euros, but I hope we can get him some much needed rest to avoid burnout.

Nor Neville Southall tbf.

5688~~~
It's scary how good he could become

5689~~~
Perhaps he could reach that with his spider-man reflexes but the shot was just too powerful to steer it anywhere else than back of the net.

5690~~~
Would have been pretty fecking impressive had Howard reached it from the bench.

5691~~~
Haha, nah I said that cos you said Howard instead of Joel.

5692~~~
Nobody could stop that.

Who's Joel ?
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5693~~~
Joel Robles, who unfortunately was on the receiving end of this masterclass by Martial. Or is it a rhetorical question from you?<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5694~~~
Yeah it was pretty much the perfect finish. What a player.

5695~~~
How many more fullbacks does he want to torch this season? Absolute wizard on the ball. Will undoubtedly start on the left next season, I feel for Depay because he's been left in the dust by this little French maestro.

5696~~~
Not really a question. In the end I'm glad Howard wasn't playing. Won us a charity shield once then won a penalty shoot out against us... in the FA Cup.

5697~~~
Can become some player, that is for certain.  Still think he needs to work on his end product, which should come with time.  Looking forward to him being here, hopefully for a long time.

5698~~~
Incredible stats. A star in the making.

An inspired signing, as it turns out! It just shows that actual football scouts may know just a bit more than journalists and the average fan. What an outstanding first season he's had. Watching him, it's actually quite easy to forget just how young he is. He's picked up his young family and settled into a new league / country with surprising ease (particularly given his price tag and the media reports following his transfer).  He seems very humble and grounded, yet supremely confident. All indications are that he has a great chance to develop into a world class player. I can see him turning into a real leader for the team over time. 

While he can certainly operate as a striker, for the time being he's absolutely tailor made for the left side of a front three. I very much look forward to watching him for years to come.

5700~~~
Yes, without a doubt.

And I still feel that with all of his involvement in the games, he could have had more goals or assists this season. If he improves his conversion rate and avoid, sometimes, going for too much, his tally will rise considerably. Besides that, fantastic player.

5701~~~
Memorable performance for all the good reasons. 
Had a great game and the 20mins he seemed to struggling with a knock shows how much important a player he is to the attack. 
Though I believe he still wanting in his decision making but for an unfinished article he is bloody brilliant.

5702~~~
Martial can be as good as he want to be, barring any injuries or setbacks.

He is laughably talented.

5703~~~
He's still a year from being the same age as Ronaldo was when everything suddenly clicked for him after the World Cup and he started tearing the league apart for giggles.

5704~~~
I swear this kid is the next Henry.  It's scary how talented and composed he is at his age.

5705~~~
His drop of the shoulder and acceleration past a player is a joy.

Already getting an aura about him.

5706~~~
Was incredibly today.... probably his best game of the season in such a big game too. Tank

5707~~~
Tony Martial came from France! 
The English press said he had no chance! 

50 million down the drain! 
Tony Martial scored again!

5708~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Thanks, mate. What was the context in which they printed my post? 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Selective quoting, I am enraged.

5709~~~
The sheer joy that you get out of watching this guy play. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> The wide player we have been missing since Ronaldo left.

5710~~~
Oh feck off. Anyone off the Caf could have told Martial that.

5711~~~
And for a moment Rooney did hesitate, thankfully he passed to Martial and we came to this conclusion. 

Viva Martial!

5712~~~
I'd have told him to shoot into the top corner, would've been an even better goal.

5713~~~
Remember when he was backed into the corner post by Besic and he absolutely embarrassed him and ran 20 metres and drew a foul? What a player

5714~~~
I remember when he first started here, the most impressive thing was the he just seemed to choose to do something and then went about making it happen. Saw that today with the run for Fellaini's goal and then for his winner - he knew what he wanted to do before he got the ball and then it was simply a matter of his teammates helping out. Has to be a nightmare to defend with his magnetic feet also.

If there's a criticism, for me, it would be that he's sometimes slow to react/change plans when something he intends doesn't come off. I'll chalk that up to his age and experience.

5715~~~
Can we threadban the word Madrid from this thread or at least temp ban anyone who tiresomely brings it up after every good performance? It's just boring, fatalist nonsense, without a shred of evidence for it happening.

With the trajectory of both club's incomes, we'll be taking players off them in a few years, unless they can somehow refinance another loan from the currently broke Spanish government or whatever it is they do when they need to bankroll another team.

5716~~~
The way he picks the ball up and just injects pace into a piece of play that was going nowhere is great. He's absolutely sensational.

5717~~~
You know what I meant.

5718~~~
Let's not forget, lots of folk were pissed at LVG from putting him out wide <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> His pace and directness are important that's for certain. Hopefully he keeps improving.

5719~~~
To be fair... (Although it's a little bit of a stretch).. Ignoring a similar instruction in the CL was the reason Welbeck was let go.

5720~~~
They've got quotes spread out over two pages for all teams, looks like they get quotes from all over.

5721~~~
Some wonderful moments from him in this game

- Assist
- flick for Lingard's chance
- that skill at the corner flag
- the flick to bring the ball over his shoulder
- Fellaini chance which was a handball
- the winner


Add to that all the times be ran at defenders and was a real threat.

5722~~~
Agreed. 

Think we need gifs of all of these.

5723~~~
No actually I don't. You insinuated that I was potty for saying real would come knocking, and are now twisting what I posted to make it look like I said it martial would jump at the chance. Fact is all i said was real will come knocking, and they will at some point.

5724~~~
I actually first wrote that but thought I was being too demanding!

5725~~~

5728~~~
Aye its brilliant for any left winger that is not called Christiano Ronaldo. Its just brilliant and if other attackers had been foing their bits throughout the season we'd be in a better position than fighting for fourth.

5729~~~
I've seen the best of Depay so far and can imagine the type of player he'd become if he reached his full potential and played in a right system, but he just havent got Martial's giftedness and talent, not in the same league. Martial can become the best attacker in the world (probably behind Neymar though), the way he glides past players, his vision, technique, only his finishing needs some improving, could have 20 easily in this bad attacking team.

5730~~~
Great skill and assist for 1-0

What a player. 

A truly special talent destined for the absolute top.

5732~~~
<a class="username" data-user="78020, @GifLord" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/78020/">@GifLord</a> hero

5733~~~
That assist segment looks dubious to me - perhaps it includes his numbers for Monaco and France, apart from his United total? That said, your overall point still stands - he's been exceptional for his age considering the pressure he was under at the start of the season, no doubt about it. Especially when our offensive unit has struggled as a whole and been short on confidence and verve, which hinders him to an extent. Great display of resilience from him, and from a footballing standpoint - you can totally envision him matching Hazard's 2014/ 2015 standard over the next season or two if we bring a couple pieces to help him, and build a cohesive unit - which will be imperative because a lot of times attacking is more predicated on instinct, so having good 'telepathic' chemistry between your players can elevate the sum of parts performance. And if he keeps progressing further, there's no reason why he can't leapfrog Hazard's peak (Eden just doesn't have the drive, apparently), and be part of the true elite - because all the ingredients are there in abundance. Haven't been this excited about a United youngster since arguably Cristiano in the mid 2000s.

5734~~~
Our best outfield player by a distance.

If Shaw returns anything like he was before injury, and if Martial keeps playing off the left flank next year could frighten the life out of teams.

5735~~~
That skill at 4:42 <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5736~~~
If LVG is here, that's where he'l play. Said yesterday after the game that he sees him as a winger and not a striker.

5737~~~
Like watching Henry in his Monaco days

5738~~~
Thank feck the pass fell to him and not Lingard(who had a decent game).

5739~~~
Lovely video montage. Great music too <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

5740~~~
I was saying this to someone yesterday <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5741~~~
The guy is incredible. Only watched him like 2 times when he was at Monaco, and was quite baffled we made such an outlay on him. He's the real deal. Ballon D'or material. The celebration was mental though, better than the goal even.

5742~~~
Don't make the mistake that I was directing it to you. We get to the fa cup final and all some want to do is bring people down with this talk of other clubs..no one wants to hear it. Even if that is what you mean, SO WHAT...if Madrid come in for him? So what? You might as well have said he would jump at the chance...It makes no difference. No one wants to hear this constant nonsense and worry about other clubs.

Enjoy the moment. I wouldn't worry about them. We had something similar with Depay after some European game. We are not a small club lol but some people act as if we are.

5743~~~
What a player. I cant determine which role is better for him

5744~~~

5745~~~
His playing style and poise on the ball reminds me a lot more of a young Anelka. Almost a clone of him

5746~~~
He will do himself a disservice by insisting on playing upfront for now. A player of his ability should see the ball as much as possible.

5747~~~
Imagine getting someone of Martial's ability (not going to be easy) on the right hand side. We'd be devastating.

5748~~~
He has played many games for us and France will be desperate to win the EC, I hope that the guy doesn't face a burn out.

5749~~~
Let's just hope France face an early exit (losing every game 4-3 with Martial hattricks of course)!

5750~~~
France have so many attacking options they probably won't use him

5751~~~
He's already a key player for them. Unless he has a stinker, I expect him to start all their games.

5752~~~
What a great option to have come off the bench when the opposition are tired.

5753~~~

5754~~~
where do you recon he will play. striker or outwide

5755~~~
Love the Martial chant.

5756~~~
Wide. Same position he plays for us.

5757~~~
With Benzema out for the euros, I expect him to play. Martial on the left, Griezmann on the right, Giroud up front? They've got plenty of options, that's for sure.

5758~~~
Martial, Benzema and Griezmann as a front three I guess. That's pretty damn good.

edit: didn't realise Benzema was out, but yeah they've still got Giroud. Or Martial, Griezmann, Coman <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5759~~~
No, it does not. I checked the stats for this season, and here: 
1 assist each against Sunderland (3-0), West Brom (2-0), Swansea (2-1), Stoke(3-0), Shrewsbury (3-0) , Everton (2-1)
2 assists vs Derby (3-0), West Ham (2-0),

Apart from this, he has 2 for Monaco, 1(2?) for France. So that would be 13 assists overall.

Edit: Just realized that all the games Martial has had an assist in, United have won. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5760~~~
Alright, fair enough. Seems like you've done your research, so no reason to doubt the numbers now. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Though I'm a bit surprised (pleasantly, mind) that the assist number is already into double figures. 24 'scorers' is a superb return, all things considered.

5761~~~
Also, very quiet fellow, isn't he? You only hear comments and stories <i>about</i> him - never <i>from</i> him.

5762~~~
Whoscored, Squawka, Goal, transfermarkt - none of them were giving me a fair count, so I opened up the match day thread for every game this season on the Caf, and then counted the number of '+' signs next to Martial's name in the lineup on the right. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5763~~~
That video is missing that amazing touch he took near the byline. its in this video around 3:23.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TXIFmsf79U0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

5764~~~
If he improves his shooting/finishing/composure, he will be the best obviously. A better Saha <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5765~~~
France will be the team to watch at the Euro's with the talent they suddenly have

5766~~~
Why didn't you include the one where he denied jokingly after that?

5767~~~
Sigh I asked in another thread because someone said he made a joky jokey afterwards but here js the full quote the place where i got it from (official site):

<b>On matchwinner Anthony Martial</b>
He could have scored in the first half when he was in the same situation, so I told him at half-time to shoot low into the corner – and he did that! It was a fantastic finish. I think he can do much better [in the future] because I see a lot of things that he can still improve and he shall improve. Only by training and by playing can you improve. Also, when you are playing at a higher level then you improve. When you are older you know all the things shall happen again. Then you have experience and you can decide much better in the same situation as before. 

From <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2016/Apr/manager-reaction-louis-van-gaal-gives-his-thoughts-on-uniteds-fa-cup-semi-final-against-everton.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...niteds-fa-cup-semi-final-against-everton.aspx</a>

I don't see a joke there, so you can see why i left that irrelevant part out. Rest assured I had no agenda and if he made a jokely dokely somewhere then I didn't know.

5768~~~
Martial will look good in a white kit few years from now... <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5769~~~
Yep always loved the White Utd away shirts

5770~~~
Did you watch the interview? He did laugh it off like it was tongue in cheek.

5771~~~
Is the consensus about his position slowly moving towards the LW position? I think it suits him better.

5772~~~
As long as it's actually as a left/wide forward, rather than a plain old left winger in 4-4-2 terms.

5773~~~
Yeah basically the Neymar/Sanchez/Reus/Ronaldo role. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5774~~~
How boring.

5775~~~
Madrid should maybe concentrate on finding their own young talents, instead of letting other clubs do the work and being the slimy shits that they are, snatch them away when they're the finished article. Thing is, you're not even guaranteed trophies with Barca around.

5776~~~
If we are playing a front three he should be on the left, but if we are playing 4231 is rather him through the middle

5777~~~
I was just reading through the thred on Ronaldo pre 2006/7 because I thought they would be very similar but they really aren't. It doesn't mean he will become a better player or anything but its pretty incredible when in here we all agree that a player is destined to be a star, there are usually divisions over most players. He's like shaw in that its not about potential, he earns his keep for the team now, potential is much less relevant when he is already delivering the goods to the extent that he is the star man in our team (dave aside).

5778~~~
His dribbling technique is amazing, how he keeps the ball under close control surrounded by opposition players is a joy to watch.

5779~~~
That old lesbian Florentino Perez can only dream of Martial. In fact, he should be worried of us taking their players and not the other way around. Just because the feckers signed Ronaldo doesn't mean Manchester United can be bullied into selling.

5780~~~
it's there, 0:46.

5781~~~
Football expert, Ray Parlour

5782~~~
Just look at the guys blasting his signing even before he's kicked a ball.

5783~~~
Wait. I've just realised he wasn't even nominated for young player of the year. How the feck did that happen? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Win the golden boy award for best youngster in Europe, but not even nominated for PFA young player. It can only have been an oversight due to him having a skillset beyond his years.

5784~~~
I think he's a top player already and would be getting more attention if we were better as a team. I'm sure he can do a great job as a striker but as a wide player he is scoring goals and also creating them for us. He is having a young Ronaldo/Rooney impact on this team in terms of his importance. He will explode next season.

5785~~~

5786~~~
this guy had huge pressure as a 36 million pound 19 year old but he's blown away any lingering doubts about his talent.

5787~~~
he reminds me a lot of andy cole actually, with a bit of henry as well.

5788~~~
What a signing. I was expecting him to be in and out of the side this season. Instead he is carrying the attack and is already the best outfield player at the club. His dribbling is exceptional but it is his intelligence that really impresses me. The flick for Lingard was pure class. With more quality around him he will be even better.

A left sided forward in a 4-3-3 is his best position just now but he is so good he could play anywhere across the front line.

5789~~~
14 goals and 10 assists so far in his debut seasons with us, at 19/20, in a faltering side with an obvious lack of creativity/quality around him in the final third. 

In 4 or 5 years this guy could be hitting Ronaldo/Messi figures.

5790~~~
I hope we do the right thing, and bring in the right players around him to benefit from this talent he has.

5791~~~
Not sure about the last bit, but 24 goals+assists is pretty great keeping in mind he's been playing so much on the left, and the total goal tally of the team.

5792~~~
I honestly thought that the transfer fee was a ridiculous one for a 19 year old. 

However they had been rumours just  a few weeks before then that Barca were planning on signing him next season(Couldnt because of the transfer ban), and Monaco werent interested in selling. They had even promised Jardim that they wouldnt sell him. 

It still was a massive gamble on our part. There's a lot I give Woodward grief for, but credit to him for having the balls to do this.

5793~~~
I think he is going to be a proper star, but I dont think we will see Messi and Ronaldo figures for a while yet. Those two have made those numbers look easy, but they are anomalies in football history. Think of how long it took for us to see someone as prolific as Gerd Muller.

5794~~~
Btw, Suarez has done it this season. Neymar was well on his way before his recent terrible run. He did get 40 last season which was great at his age.

5795~~~
I can't see any team in England dominating enough for a player to get 50 goals.

5796~~~
Fair enough, But I cant really see it becoming the norm, especially in something like the UCL where those two have consistently hit outrageous figures..7 goals or so in the UCL used to be quite impressive..now you find them having scored that in the group stages.

5797~~~
In 2/3 years, if we're back to being the attacking force we used to be, we could easily expect 25-30 goals a season with 10-15 assists on top.

5798~~~
Not rated as much as the others. Players are the ones who vote so he didn't get enough to be in the top six I guess. 

Harry Kane
Philippe Coutinho
Romelu Lukaku
Dele Alli
Ross Barkley
Jack Butland

5799~~~
Martial is skilled and he plays with panache and I'm a sucker for that type of player. Of course I'd love to see him in Madrid, but that's just me so no need to get nervous for now. You'll have no problem keeping him if United quickly get's back to where they were, but if that doesn't happen, the only thing I can see is Martial leaving 2 seasons from now, and I hope old lesbian will be in for him.

5800~~~
I can honestly say that when we signed him, I wasn't mad about the fee like almost everyone were (including the famous Andy Tate). I don't know why but I somehow had a feeling that there must be more than just the outrageous fee. And I was proved correct with his first appearance (vs Liverpool). 

We're lucky to have him. Praying to god that he'll stay fit and I can't fecking wait what he can do once we have our team sorted out.

5801~~~
<img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

5802~~~
I still keep going back to that 93rd minute winner. Must have watched it around 20 times already. 
What a player.

5803~~~
How do some opposing fans have the audacity so suggest he under-performed or had a bad season?

5804~~~
Jealousy.

5805~~~
Genuinely can't be anything else, he's the Golden Boy holder, what more do they want?

5806~~~
Some rival fan called him "ridiculously overrated" a week or so ago <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5807~~~
A Liverpool fan of course..

5808~~~
Unsurprisingly, yes.

5809~~~
It just angers me, even funnier is that FIFA have lowered his potential to 84 on FIFA 16.

5810~~~
Some United fans in this forum have said the same. Crazy stuff.

5811~~~
Niall Quinn said he'd expected more of him prior to the derby a few weeks ago. What an idiot.

There are a lot of things you can justifiably slag Utd off for these days, but Martial isn't one of them. He's been incredible, a ray of light in the gloom for most of the season.

5812~~~
Still can't believe that goal. Him and DDG are probably the only two players where you can't make a case of them disappointing.

5813~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5814~~~
I would have loved to have Martial at Bayern, SZ reported he was a big transfer target of ours for 2016, but United pulled the trigger on him. I expect in terms of importance for United he will be as huge as DdG in a couple of years time. Really an exciting young player!

5815~~~
Niall Quinn is a colossal bellend. I can't watch Sunderland or City on Sky anymore because they always cart him out to spew his bitter nonsense.

5816~~~
Martial. He's a footballer whose game brings a smile to my face. He's really impressed me.

5817~~~
Opposing fans?

There are some on this very thread who do the same. Some clown was comparing him to dogshite like Origi ffs.

5818~~~
Gutted he didn't score that goal against Tottenham, he really deserved it. So often he's close to glimpses of absolute genius, but then it's ruined by a poor touch or a dodgy shot. 

Once it clicks for him he's going to be absolutely unstoppable.

5819~~~
Yep, but it's very very normal. I'd say if we were to look back at Henry when he was 20, he was very similar. However,  that run and finish in the semi final is what we'll surely be seeing on a regular basis as he gets older and progresses. You don't lose that calm ability in front of goal, it can only get better and that makes me very very excited.

5820~~~
hopefully that's something which is encouraged and not coached out of him. Sometimes managers/coaches do that

5821~~~
Said it before but in 4-5 years if he isn't hitting Ronaldoesque numbers i.e. 40+ goals a season, I would argue he hasn't reached his potential.

With his talent, he really should be aiming to attain that level of excellence. At this age, he is already ahead of Ronaldo in my opinion based on his development curve - he has a naturally higher footballing IQ. On the flip side, Ronaldo had a far more versatile style of game, naturally ambidextrous, much better flair/trickery and super ambitious. It is not a cert that he can hit those numbers, far from it but although he is less naturally gifted than a Ronaldo in terms of awe-inspiring skill, he has a beautifully simple game which is more like a Messi.. more about close control, drops of the shoulder and gliding through gaps.

Its why I think he can be a huge player in big games in the coming years because a guy with athleticism and close control, can be incredibly difficult to mark in tight encounters. Messi can get snuffed out of very tight games because he lacks the physicality some times to bully the opposition, whereas Ronaldo lacks the finesse to sometimes put on a complete show against big teams. Martial is the type of player who once he matures, could dominate big matches like a Ronaldinho did in his pomp but without the dazzling skills.

5822~~~
He's been less of a dogshite since Klopp took over to be fair to him, but yeah, those comparisons are ridiculous.

5823~~~
they really really are. origi hasn't made it through LVG boot camp. Martial made it through and is still putting up good numbers

5824~~~
I disagree. Natural talent is only one part of the equation. Having a ridiculously merciless work ethic and an exceptional football IQ (ie a football brain) are the other two thirds. We only know the natural talent bit at the present and time will tell if the other two develop him further. Therefore expecting Ronaldoesque numbers is just setting a lofty bar that will result in a perception that he has underachieved. Let him develop at his own pace instead of bringing players like Ronaldo into the equation.

I agree with your post (the bolded bit). For me Martial, taking his age into account has an exceptional footballing brain relative to his position and style of play. He's not a Messiesque #10 of the future but as a pure wing forward/striker hybrid... he has everything you would want, decent eye for a pass, good link up play, movement, knows how to exploit gaps within the defence when running with the ball at high speed, get out of tricky tight spaces. He has a great feel for the game, more than Ronaldo did at his age... basically if you were trying to create a ruthless goal machine from out wide, Martial comes pretty close to the ideal prototype. He's even more direct than a Neymar/Reus.

So for me he has 2/3's of his game complete. So in terms of talent.. both technical/footballing IQ wise, he has it all (relative to his age). Obviously there is still much growth to be had in this area which brings me on to the next point.

The thing that will underpin whether the technique/IQ improves and therefore he becomes even more productive is the work ethic element. That is not something which is out of his control, work ethic.. if he puts the hard yards in there is no reason why he shouldn't be hitting those numbers. If he fails to put in the hard yards, then yes he should be disappointed as he will only have himself to blame.

For me if Martial was to peak in terms of producing Hazard/Robbenesque or Ribery numbers goalwise, yes I would definitely consider that a failure because he isn't a playmaking winger.. he is there to be a goal threat. Everything is set up for him to be an unstoppable force of nature down the wing and rack up an insane amount of goals. He is a natural finisher and for me his competition should be someone like Neymar. He should be aiming for 30+ goals a season at his peak.

The amount of chances he creates for himself, the way he can finish, the amount of times we see him nearly score worldies and the way he comes alive in the box.. he is the type of player who could get hat tricks quite easily against weaker opposition. He has it in him to dominate games on the goal front.

5826~~~
I don't think he has more than natural ability at this stage. Whether or not he is a natural goalscorer is completely open to debate since he had only scored 14 goals ever before joining us. More broadly, its critical to downplay expectations with players like him and allow the player to organically develop over time rather than conjuring up arbitrary numbers of how many goals you think he should score because you've arbitrarily rated him to reach a certain level.

5827~~~
Fair enough. But obviously you have to take some form of a leap in terms of imagination when it comes to rating younger players otherwise you'd wait 7 years and when they come good.. say well I knew he had it in him in hindsight.

I am sure United when signing him had to arbitrarily rate him to some degree as in terms of productivity he had hardly set the world alight prior to joining us. They must have assumed he had it in him to be a goal threat worthy of plying his trade here. 

If you were coaching him, of course it is critical to downplay expectations both when dealing with him as well as the media. I would be surprised however if in the minds of many at Old Trafford, they weren't secretly expecting him to have the world at his feet.. the 'Ballon D'Or' clause said it all for me.

5828~~~
<a class="username" data-user="43572, @Raees" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/43572/">@Raees</a> sent you a message

5829~~~
I think it's unfair to expect him to get 40/50 goals. Those kind of figures depend heavily on the team he is playing and how competitive the league is.

5830~~~
Yeah suarez scored 8 goals last week in 2 nothing games, really pads out the stats, not that suarez isn't incredible or anything

5831~~~
yep. also he's a type of player who can help out the team in more than just goals

5832~~~
He'd be more Henry than Saha. He does more special things like individual runs, making his own chances and assists. Much more than Saha

5833~~~
Football growth doesn't work like this I'm afraid. Ask Hazard. You either have the capacity to do a Ronaldo or Messi or you don't. You can't estimate it based on a player scoring 14 in a season. No one is expecting Kane to hit their numbers and he is a far more proven goalscorer

5834~~~
Strange. Sterling last year at 20 years of age scored <b>13 and got 9 assists</b> yet went for <b>£50 mill</b>. He had completed 2.5 seasons in England making <b>150</b> odd <b>appearances in club football</b>. In Liverpool's title challenging season he got a respectable<b> 10 goals and 7 assists</b>. So if Sterling was the second coming of Christ, how can someone say with a straight face "Anthony Martial is overrated. He has underperformed"       14 goals 10 assists and counting.

5835~~~
Hence "could" - implies uncertainty.

5836~~~
I think it's down to jealousy and/or not watching enough of him to form an adequate opinion, but then again I find the "average season" claims just as ridiculous.

5837~~~
He will be Martial, he is a special talent no need to be compared to Saha, Henry or Moses.

One day, I hope I can be there to sing along. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

5839~~~
Name and shame that idiot please.

5840~~~
I really do think the 433 formation is the best way to get him, Rashford ** into the team.

He's the sort of player who should be given a free reign and not asked to do too much defending, save his energy for attacking. 

I Imagine getting him into a Ronaldo style 2nd striker form the wing will be the best way for him going forward.

5841~~~

5842~~~
433 formation allows him to drift into space that would have been taken up by a No 10. Against Everton, he used the space to good effect. Besic didn't know whether to follow him or not. Same with Lingard. That's why both players were very involved.

5843~~~
Exactly, what I mean, having a few deeper midfielders and leaving a hole infront of the defence actualy draws their midfielders away, leaving more room for them to work in. It also means they need to play a more narrow formation which can help leave our wingers 1v1. It's no coincidence our form has risen since we stopped playing a 4231 or using a number 10 in general.

5844~~~
Not a surprise.

5845~~~
Tip: overrated doesn't mean he's shit.

5846~~~
He is underrated, they think that he is playing at his best level.

5847~~~
Who's they? I dunno why I even got dragged into this discussion...

5848~~~
The people you tipped.

5849~~~
Good goal and loving some of the runs he's made first half.

5850~~~
Quiet after the goal but he's always a threat. Our only threat at times.

5851~~~
Hes been quite poor this half. Started well, but hes continuously given the ball away in good positions.

5852~~~
Been good but his short passing has been off.

5853~~~
Why is he on the right????!

5854~~~
Double team him and we dont win.

5855~~~
That annoyed me too. Was a waste and is always a waste yet somehow weve done it more than a few times this season.

Loved his finish though. Wish he had a competent left back to play with.

5856~~~
15 goals for us this season, very good output for a young winger in his first season of English football.

5857~~~
Fingers crossed Shaw comes back with no problems...

5858~~~
Took his goal well and looked our main threat as usual, it's a shame he gets so little link up with Rojo in comparison to how Lingard and Valencia were operating on the right.

5859~~~
Just wait till next season when Shaw is back <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

5860~~~
Didnt really look at it today, especially compared to last week, although I suppose thats my fault for expecting a performance like that one every game from now on.

5861~~~
Took his goal well, and as usual was a constant threat. He just needs to focus a bit more when he's passing. Got into good areas today, but often broke down because of a poor pass. Will come with experience, though.

5862~~~
Most teams work to put the ball on the plate for players like Martial, got a chance kicked it in the goal, not at his best though.

5863~~~
Imagine where we'd be had we not stuck gold with him. LvG should count his blessings on that one.

5864~~~
Had 15 goals and 10 assists in mind as a benchmark for a strong first season. Very pleased he's got there with four games to go.

5865~~~
i mean....

5866~~~
Where would we have been without him or de gea this season <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

5867~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Don't get me wrong he was still good and probably our best player, just the standards he has set himself are so high now in my eyes. He looked a bit tired today though imo.

5868~~~
Scored the goal and created acres of space on the left only for #RojoIsShit to feck it up time and time again. Too bad he isn't surrounded by better players.

5869~~~
A foreign 20yr old bought for huge money by United - if he wasn't justifying the price, you'd never hear the end of it.

Didn't link up with others much today, which is a shame because he really comes to life then. A better team/tactics around him and he'd be pushing 20 goals already.

5870~~~
He's great. 20 goals+ next season.

5871~~~
It's actually an amazing return for someone who's new to league and barely 20

How was he not among the nominations for YPOTY?

5872~~~
Was he not? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's criminal.

5873~~~
I agree he must've been very close to being considered, his goal return for his first season has been very good.

5874~~~
Just had a look and the shortlist was Kane, Alli, Coutinho, Butland, Lukaku and Barkley. I'd argue that he's had a more impressive season than at least two of those. Quite an English list, really.

5875~~~
Don't know how he got in ahead of Barkley who has had barely any impact in comparison to him.

5876~~~
Scored and was a threat when needed. Leicester are tough defensively, with simpson giving it his all.

5877~~~
Agree with both of these, not to mention that the 4-3-3 suits most of our midfielders more than 4-2-3-1 anyway. This season has been such a fecking trainwreck.

5878~~~
The kid keeps on scoring despite receiving more attention. That's key going forward.

5879~~~
His potential is incredible. Imagine how good he'd be in a Fergie side..

5880~~~
He's a magician on the ball, they should make him play in a full length wizard robe. It will also help opposition fullbacks and give them a fighting chance.

5881~~~
The thought of a fully fit Shaw operating on the flank with Martial gets me all hot and bothered. 

Fingers crossed he comes back at 100%.

5882~~~
Ye, hope he doesn't lose his ferociousness.

5883~~~
The most Martial I've ever seen him.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/TX5BZuw.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/TX5BZuw.png"/>

5884~~~
Remember when some journo said Martial wasn't smiling anymore? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5885~~~

5886~~~
"I'm not manager to take risks". 

No shit <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

5887~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I think he said that specially for the caf

5888~~~
The first word of truth to come out of his mouth for months.

5889~~~
Any word on if he'll be fit for Tuesday?

5890~~~

5891~~~
No Martial no cl party.

5892~~~
We need him if we're going to get CL football. There's no way I can see us scoring without him.

5893~~~
Would be a huge boost if he's fit, as he's our best attacking player by a distance, and one of the best in the country. 

That said, we have won games without him before, and we can do so again.

5894~~~
Shiiiiiiiiit

5895~~~
It's over.

5896~~~
Curtains

5897~~~
When we need him most, this shit happens, after being fit all season. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

Speedy recovery Martial..

5898~~~
In days gone by you would think this is a classic Fergie move into lulling the opposition into a false sense of security <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

5899~~~
If true, we're missing attacking option #1 and #10 (Felli).  Memphis really needs to show something here.

5900~~~
James Ducker is also reporting that Martial will miss the West Ham game and faces a race against time to be fit for Bournemouth.

Somebody needs step up to the plate and deliver the goods on Tuesday.

5901~~~
Well, feck.

5902~~~
How about this for a front line?

Young Rashford Lingard  and Mata as 10

5903~~~
Welp, there goes the Champions League. 

Pack it all up, lads.

5904~~~
Ando be happy.

5905~~~
Give Pereira the creative midfield job and push Rooney further forward. Hopefully the rest did Rashford the world of good.

5906~~~
I wouldn't rush him back for Bournemouth as he may not be fully fit and could also injure himself for the FA Cup final.

5907~~~
Feck....

5908~~~
We can beat West Ham without him, I'm more concerned for the cup final.

5909~~~
Typical.

5910~~~
He'll most likely be back for the final going by reports.

5911~~~
who knew that going into a season with 2 senior strikers was a risk.

No one at all saw that as a risk...

Probably best not to rest Rashford again though...

5912~~~
As long as he's fit for the FA Cup final.

5913~~~
This is LvG we're talking about here.  He'd put Young up top and Lingard as the #10.

5914~~~
+ Rashford RB

5915~~~
West Ham was already a huge ask with him but once he's fit for the final I don't mind.

5916~~~
Agree, you want a fully fit Martial for Palace. It's simply not worth the risk with a final so soon.

5917~~~
Dont remind me. Young was brought back from injury as a CF, struggled as expected then dropped.

This is nothing though, I remember last season where we had Mata in the middle and Fellaini on the wings, and we were wipping in crosses like crazy into the box.

5918~~~
Of course you dont take risks. Just look at the football you have us play.

5919~~~
I'm more concerned about West Ham than Palace!

5920~~~
Good news - he's traveled with the squad.

5921~~~
Hopefully we don't aggravate it.

5922~~~
Same. I think we can win the FA Cup without Martial, but beating West Ham away without him, and also without the brutish Fellaini mostly for defensive set pieces, is a tall order.

5923~~~
He'll make it if he travelled i think.

5924~~~
Much prefer he plays tomorrow over Palace and Bournmouth.

5925~~~
Much prefer we don't risk fecking up his hamstrings tbf. 

Only play him if he's 100%.

5926~~~
Our chances of winning go significantly down if he doesn't play, our most creative and dangerous player by far.

5927~~~
I read that he's been ruled out already - unless its mindgames, but that would be a first for us under LVG if it is

5928~~~
There is no way we would be playing mindgames as long as LVG is our manager.

5929~~~
I'd be really surprised to see him start. LvG doesn't take chances.

5930~~~
This is a conundrum. Tonight's fixture is by far our toughest of the last three games. 
If he wants to play and feels comfortable, he should. I am sure he won't want to risk the euros. 
But I'm also worried he has a dr add up game because he's not sprinting properly.

5931~~~
I think you play him if he's anywhere close to being fit. 

Fourth place is more important than the FA Cup, and there's all summer for him to recover.

5932~~~
Have a feeling he'll play tonight.

5933~~~
He's back!! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5934~~~
Hope he's fully fit and not at risk of further injury tonight...

5935~~~
LVG said he won't take risks, hopefully this means he's absolutely fine. 

Cmon lad <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> hopefully it was a bit of Fergie mind games!

5936~~~
Oh joy!

5937~~~
Yes!
That feeling when you'd completely written off someone playing, and they play!

As he's pretty much our only flair, it could be essential to a win

5938~~~
Mata did really well for the goal, but man this guy is so good. He's already top class. What a player he is going to be.

5939~~~
Martial had already scored that goal when Rashford passed it to Mata. He's a very clever player.

5940~~~
what a waste of money

5941~~~
What a waste of money!!! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5942~~~
Outrageously good

5943~~~
Like Giggs in FA cap against Arsenal! Transcendent!

5944~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/5MY6L5c.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/5MY6L5c.png"/>

5945~~~
Love this bloke. Could have paid double for him and I'd not give 1 feck

5946~~~
This guy. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5947~~~
He's so good, man.

5948~~~
As I've already said, he's closest clone to brazilian Ronaldo!

5949~~~
Would chew him so hard <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

5950~~~
And to think there was a chance he didn't play today.

5951~~~
Give him all the monies

5952~~~
One of only a few bright spots for us.  Magical at times.

5953~~~
Would love to go forward 7/8 years and see just how good he becomes. 17 goals in your first season in England for a 19/20 y/o is really, really impressive.

5954~~~
He's brilliant. I mean, look how good he's been in this terrible setup. Imagine him in a fluid, functional team.

5955~~~
Where would we be without this guy? Just imagine having one or two more players with his quality in the team

5956~~~
The only player alongside De Gea who is really worthy of playing in the champions league.

The rest under Van Gaal just are not good enough

5957~~~
As if he wasn't my favorite current United player already, the kid has balls and skills, plain and simple.

5958~~~
Wow, really want to know how good he'll be in a few years time.

5959~~~
Martial- Rashford are the future.

5960~~~
We need to clone him. Pronto!

5961~~~
The only outfield player who hasn't played like a fecking clown tonight. 

Basically can be said about 90% of the season.

5962~~~
Completely carries us. It's like Liverpool under Suarez the year before they challenged for the league.

5963~~~
Is this the biggest 1 man team you have ever seen of any United side?

5964~~~
Must be fecking annoyed with the defence today.

5965~~~
If I was him I'd punch out at the whole defence+herrera and if the club don't like it I go. We need him more than he needs us now, all of europe would want him.

5966~~~
Brilliant. Poor guy amongst rubbish.

5967~~~
Can't we just lock every thread and all live in here?

5968~~~
We struck gold with this guy. He will be the worlds best player if he keep this up.

5969~~~
As is so often the case our only ray oh hope among a shower of shite.

5970~~~
We have an absolute world beater on the books and that cushions the blow slightly but I feel so down right now.

5971~~~
I genuinely feel for the guy, a class act among players that shouldn't be anywhere near the shirt. Him and De Gea in fact.

5972~~~
He's brilliant. Shame the rest don't have his drive and talent.

5973~~~
For Martial alone I don't want this season to end, he's in amazing form

5974~~~
96 percent of the man of the match votes. If it was an outfield player of the season vote i'd hope to see the same, only thing keeping me watching.

5975~~~
17 goals now in his first season. Imagine how good he'll be once we get rid of the twat in charge.

5976~~~
Anyways, this puts to bed about his best position. The way he plays suits to the left side perfectly. Funnily enough, it was something like that we expected from Depay.

5977~~~
Aye, I can imagine someone like Zidane is already making phone calls. He'll show some magic at the Euro's and Bayern or Madrid would be mad not to try and get him. And quite frankly Martial would be mad not to leave this sinking ship. 

Let's just hope he really, really likes it here for some reason because at the moment he's pretty much all we've got.

5978~~~
Excellent. He's been productive recently, strong finish to the season.

5979~~~
A shining light through the fog of finest piss that this season is.

5980~~~
SAF's final season was not that far off.

5981~~~
This lad is a star, let down by his team mates.

5982~~~
If there's one thing we have going for us, it's that we were the ones willing to take a risk and spend a huge sum of money on him. That show of trust in him is at least one major positive for us. Unfortunately, that's all we can bank on.

5983~~~
The same as Wolfsburg, he did his job. 

Everyone else let him down.

5984~~~
Zidane will be sacked at sometime next season is my guess.

5985~~~
Remember some on here think he's underperformed.

You can see him winning world player of the year by the time he's 24. IF we build a decent team for him.

5986~~~
WE hung on to Rooney and Ronaldo when we were utterly crap during 03-05. We should be fine.

5987~~~
Let down severely by his teammates tonight, and managed to deliver a great performance despite being a doubt to even play tonight. I'm glad to see that he has ending his debut season strongly as many young players fade at the end of their breakthrough seasons. People talk about his potential but I think he's already a damn good player and one of the best attacking players in the league right now. 17 goals and 10 assists (47 appearances) in his debut season, Mahrez has 18 goals and 11 assists this season (in 42 appearances).

5988~~~
And have a coach that understand his best qualities and squeezes the most of out of him. The team should be trying to get him one and one vs a defender as much as possible. He will destroy 9/10 defenders if given the space.

5989~~~
We had SAF then.

5990~~~
I just hope we can put a team deserving of him around him soon. Otherwise you can be sure he'll be off in another season or two.

5991~~~
I dont know if they stayed cos of that alone. A lot of fans and pundits thought Sir Alex was done.

5992~~~
Feel for him after literally doing all he could.

Surrounded by shite.

5993~~~
He's a superstar. I thought he had a bit of tendency to be a bit too passive before the FA Cup Semi Final, but since then he's playing with that fire of a Van Persie, Ronaldo, prime Rooney trying to take over a game at key moments.

5994~~~
We used to have Sir Alex Ferguson, the man who had won the treble 4 years prior to 2003.

5995~~~
We probably give Rojo and Valencia more service.

5996~~~
Pretty much this. If we didnt have him, we wouldnt even have had a shot on target.

5997~~~
He should leave. Were an utter shambles. 

I would be absolutely fuming if I was him. Hes surrounded by monkeys.

5998~~~
Unfortunately I agree. Won't be long before Real comes sniffing around, perfect Ronaldo replacement if he keeps developing like he has this season. We need to make sure we have a competitive team assembled before that day comes or we will have zero chance of keeping him around. I mean it's not going to be very high if Real is involved anyways but if we are still a team struggling to get 4th spot we have zero chance of stopping him joining one of the best teams around.

5999~~~
Players like him and DdG deserve to play against the likes of Bayern or Barca on thre big stage. Instead he gets to carry the likes of Blind, Valencia, Rojo, Herrera and co who are relentlessy grabbing and dragging him down to away ties in Iceland against gardeners and firemen doing football as a side job.

It will be a long time before we host a big CL tie again. Sigh.

6000~~~
He was awesome. Really, just love the guy. The rest just don't seem to want it as much as this young ambitious player. Shame.

6001~~~
Our best player this season. I just don't want to imagine where we'd have been without him.

6002~~~
Everyone questions where we'd be without De Gea but the same can be said for this guy too. I feel sorry for him having to drag the rest of the useless lot along.

6003~~~
I must say he is great, that bright light which still makes me watching United week in week out. I really don't even think about what would be with us if we wouldn't sign him. I can't care less how much we spend for him, I would cared if we would spend 10 times more then we did.

6004~~~
A shame he was on the losing side today. Was far from his best game, but his second goal deserved to be the winner.

6005~~~
Did really well to get both goals in, we're lucky to have him

6006~~~
Another season of us being shite under this fraud I could see him being tempted away by a top club that actually knows how to play good attacking football and challenge for leagues and the CL. He is a star in the making.

6007~~~
Imagine if this transfer didn't happen on the last day. I shudder to think where we would be.

6008~~~
The vibe in this thread is so much nicer, I don't want to go anywhere else on the site due to the warranted negativity, but for a player to still give us such great optimism while we are in the worst moment of our season really is something special.

6009~~~
17 goals, beat my expectations for a fantastic season.

6010~~~
He might reach 20/10 the way he is going. Amazing coming from the left.

6011~~~
20/10 would be brilliant. Beyond all imagination tbh, I wanted him to get 10/10 in this first season, far surpassed that.

6012~~~
imagine how good he will be when we get rid of that dutchbag and start to click again, wonder if he's still here when it happens

6013~~~
at this point it's stating the obvious, but we would be below chelsea in the league table if it wasn't for this guy and DDG.

6014~~~
Shocked if he's here in September.

6015~~~
An absolute joy to watch, this kid. As many others have said, he's been a ray of sunshine in an otherwise dark season. I look forward to watching him develop. His potential really is scary.

6016~~~
Pretty amazing goal + assist tally considering he has mostly played on the left and is part of an LvG team that offers him virtually no support... Just imagine how good this kid will be in a few years with a functioning side <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Truly is one of the best u21 players of the past 15 years.

6017~~~
Or else someone will.<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

6018~~~
Imagine we don't have him in the team now.  Where will our goals and attacking threats come from.

6019~~~
He really is the only positive Thing the LVG era brought to us.

6020~~~
Remember Martial vs Depay thread in the beginning of the season? Everyone was telling how Depay will have a better season, but there is a slight chance that Martial will become a better player.

Well.

Now our team is basically him and De Gea. Hopefully Shaw will come back close to his summer level, then we'll have three world beaters, a couple of players that can be elevated to the good level by strong partners (Smalling; and I still have hope for at least one of Schneiderlin/Herrera, I adore the latter even though his last season form looks like a purple patch now).

6021~~~
Yeah. Right. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6022~~~
We weren't anywhere near this bad.

It's probably too early to worry about losing a 20 year old right now, but we need to sort ourselves out quickly because a club not being at the level of it's players is not something that ends well. He's the sort of talent who, if fulfills his potential, deserves to play for one of Europe's elite, so we better make sure we are one of Europe's elite by then.

6023~~~
17 goals and 10 assists now despite playing in an absolute mess of a team / system.

Honestly, can you imagine this guy playing under a good manager in a fluid, organised, attacking system! If he can achieve those numbers this season, he's clearly capable of so much more. There's only so much the lad can do by himself and eh, he's only 20, madness.

6024~~~
He would have had at at least 22 goals and 15 assists.

He's a magical player.

6025~~~
I honestly think he could have been nearer the 30 mark goals wise, in a functional team that has some semblance of cohesion in the attacking third with some actual playmakers that can pick out a pass.

6026~~~
What else is there to say about our Tony Martial? What a player. Glides over the ground effortlessly. Almost has a Zidane/Bergkamp-like ability to beat you without you knowing.

And he's still so young. We've had a lot of youngsters exceed expectations this season, but this kid is the pick of the bunch. Would not be at all surprised if he goes on to be one of the best in the world, and I hope he serves as the driving force for the other youngsters around him to learn their trade.

6027~~~
It's a joke how much negative you're.

6028~~~
Our only good player yesterday and it seems the only one with some balls

6029~~~
What a player. It really is shocking to think where we'd be if we hadn't signed him. I remember our manager saying he one for the future, he's already our best outfield player.

6030~~~
17 goals and 10 assists is a fantastic return.

6031~~~
He really is. And as much as I love the lad and I really do but this just shouldn't be the case. We should have players leading him. Like our freaking captain who is well past it.

6032~~~
Don't you love people scaring of our 'good' players leaving to other teams coz we are shit. Then, more or less same people would come and say we don't want top 4 so that the manager gets sacked. Then tell you that we are a top team and should be signing this and that and we should act like a top team.

Irony.

6033~~~
Along with De Gea only player that has turned up all season for us. Would love to see him in a fully functional attacking United team. Unless things change play style/managerial wise he won't be here for long.

6034~~~
He's too young to handle being our best player. It'll go to his head. Bound to. We're going to have to splash the cash again on a big name so he has someone to look up to.

6035~~~
Dear me Rossi....don't kick us when we are already down <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

6036~~~
Hope t does go to his head and he destroyed the defence and Herrera yesterday. Shit on Schneiderlin as well while he's at it.

6037~~~
I do feel for him.

* Scored the opening goal in the big decider vs Wolfsburg.

* Scored the injury time winner against Everton in the FA Cup Semi-Final.

* Scored the two goals to completely change the game and put us in the lead in the Top 4 decider.

Only one of those can still be meaningful. He's done his bit in all the crunch games. The rest have not.

6038~~~
Already better stats than POTY hazard in the same position.

6039~~~
Strange.

6040~~~
Repeated at the weekend that he wants to be here for many years. I think the posts saying he's off should stop. I don't know why they annoy me.

6041~~~
Iniesta had shit stats too you know, don't belittle Hazard!

6042~~~
Let's not transfer the negativity in here as well. He's only 20, we signed him for an absolute fortune and won't be going anywhere. Let's just enjoy one of the few bright sparks of this abysmal season.

6043~~~
17 goals, 10 assist for a 20 year old in his first season at Manchester United and he's done it pretty much all by himself. Worth!

DDG, Smalling, Martial and Rashford. That's where it's at.

6044~~~
Magnifique!

6045~~~
Not trying to belittle Hazard. Just showing how impressive his numbers are.

6046~~~
His second goal was wonderful for that attacking run at the defender. I always like to see a winger/forward run at the defence, and beat them, rather than receiving the ball and just passing it back the way it came.

6047~~~
It's awful that we can't fully appreciate what he did for us last night. If our team wasn't absolute pond scum, his second would have been the winner.

6048~~~
Remember when people compared this guy to fecking Origi<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6049~~~
Yup, he would have gotten us CL football. He must be feeling extremely let-down.

6050~~~
He's had a better season than Chicha's first season here and arguably RvP's. Shame it didn't matter. Amazing player.

6051~~~
He hasn't had a better 1st season than either.

6052~~~
He is the only exciting thing about this team. it's quite insane to think where we would be without him this year. I genuinely think we would have been about 9th?.

Really pleased that he's started to rack up a few more goals, his tally didn't express how good he's been.

6053~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6054~~~
Chicha I'll grudgingly give you, but a better first season than RVP? Really?

6055~~~
It was an actual thread <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

6056~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6057~~~
Easily better than Hernandez's.

Not RVP, obviously.

6058~~~
I wonder whether he might have caught the eye of some of the big Champions League clubs?  I'd hate to lose both De Gea and Martial this summer

6059~~~
He's got four years (well, 3 with an option of a further year) left on his contract with no release clause. He's not going anywhere.

<a class="externalLink" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BFKRw_qKZ7u/?taken-by=martial_9" target="_blank">https://www.instagram.com/p/BFKRw_qKZ7u/?taken-by=martial_9</a>

6060~~~
No it isn't, it's easily not. Hernandez scored more goals and more crucial goals, costing about 5 times less. Possibly one of the best debut seasons we have ever had from any player.

6061~~~
The cost is irrelevant to "how good a season a player had". Hernandez played for a team that was miles better under a manager that was miles better. And as much as I liked the little guy, he was very limited compared to martial who can carry an attack. The contribution to the buildup and overall influence is much greater in Martial's case.

6062~~~
Don't be silly

6063~~~
He's one of those players that isn't that quick without the ball but he has it he seems lightning. You see Carrick or Rooney spray the ball into space for him to run onto yesterday but he didn't seem to have that burst to get to the ball but then when he is running at defenders and going past them you just can't catch him. I think his best position will always be on the left of a front 3, he is a player that needs the ball at his feet to be dangerous - he doesn't seem to want to make off the ball runs all game like Rashford.

6064~~~
Given that he is only 20 and had no experience in this league, I'm inclined to agree that Martial has had a better first season than Van Persie, relatively speaking. Van Persie was already a world star when we bought him, with a lot of experience in England, in a much more cohesive team. What Martial has done in this side is phenomenal.

6065~~~
This was entirely down to how fast Antonio is...one of the leagues quickest players

6066~~~
Martial is obviously a better player and carries our attack.. But Hernandez had a terrific first season and complemented the team brilliantly, giving us that pace in behind and clinical finishing to pop up with late goals time and time again that year. Martial was great this season but Hernandez was a huge part in us winning the title and getting to the CL final. Martial hasn't had that opportunity but it's still a big plus in Hernandez's favor.

6067~~~
I am becoming increasingly impressed by how strong he is.

6068~~~
I think he loves the club deeply, last few times he's scored he's patted the badge and looked to the crowd.
I'm not worried him leaving any time soon, but we need to give him (and DDG) success to make them not want more from their careers.

6069~~~
So did Di Maria (have a lengthy contract that is). All Martial needs to do is to ask to leave and our nice and kind management would escort him to a new club happily.

6070~~~
We clearly wanted Di Maria gone in the end, he never wanted to be here in the first place. Look at De Gea for a better example of us holding onto a young talent.

6071~~~
By accident...

6072~~~
Madrid have been knocking on the door long before last summer. Anyway, history has shown us that we look after our young talents. Martial will be very well payed, just as De Gea currently is.

6073~~~
History should also tell us that if we are not successful as a club they will leave.

6074~~~
Madrid aren't successful though.  Plus we lost Ronaldo etc from a position of strength.  He even tried to leave a year earlier when we we PL and CL champions to join a Madrid side who were nowhere.  Freaking old man RVN and Baptista up front..

6075~~~
Our season would've been over months ago if it wasn't for him. I can't believe how many times he has created goals out of absolutely nothing. I'm excited to see what he can do in a team that doesn't have an absolutely useless *philosophy* about attacking.

6076~~~
Probably cos of our prior situation with a certain #7 in Madrid?  Mind you, still think he'll stay for a while though.  Seems proper excited playing for us.

6077~~~
Yeah, I think that's what makes him so dangerous running at defenders - unlike Mahrez, or Hazard, or whoever else you have on the wing who possesses the same level of insane tight ball control, he can also go toe-to-toe with midtable cloggers. Antonio is the quintessence of that kind of player and Martial absolutely bullied him.

6078~~~
Di Maria:
<ul>
<li>didn't want to sign for us in the first place. If PSG hadn't had the "FFP" issue, he'd have gone there in a shot.</li>
<li>clashed with LVG multiple times and they didn't get on.</li>
<li>ended up playing 2000' in all competitions (32 matches, subbed on 8 times, playing 90' just 11 times), scoring just 3 goals and giving 11 assists. In the end he only played as a sub for us.</li>
</ul>Martial on the other hand has played 4000' for us in all competitions (47 matches, subbed on 4 times, playing 90' 40 times), scoring 17 goals and setting up 10 for us. He's one of our most important players and hasn't shown any sign that he's unhappy - unlike Di Maria.

6079~~~
I agree Martial will be much better and is a more all round footballer.

6080~~~
Ah great, I didn't know players couldn't move in contract <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6081~~~
There's no way in a million years he's leaving this summer and its scare mongering to suggest otherwise.

6082~~~
He's not going anywhere - we signed him for a fecking fortune and we're not some no-mark club. Stop with this small-time bullshit and just enjoy the fact that he chose us.

6083~~~
Not this summer, we'll see in a few years. If we're not competitive he will be leaving

6084~~~
if we're not competitive in a 'few years' - Martial leaving will be the least of our worries

6085~~~
Indeed

6086~~~
I don't think so. We paid a lot of money and since he is becoming only better and better there will be no club willing to spend the money they would have to if they want to buy him.

6087~~~
Yeah right. I guess you didn't see what Bayern just spent on an 18 yr old

6088~~~
If you think Bayern can buy a player from us we don't want to sell and is tied to a long contract you need to look at our earnings and ask how the feck could they afford to do that exactly.

6089~~~
Bayern could not afford Martial from us they don't invest as significant amounts in individual players as the other big two. Madrid and Barca could but we have just made him our key player in his first season in the country, his wages will increase soon enough and he could leave in a couple of years if we don't improve but definitely not soon. At this point I think with us having paid probably 50 and his value certainly increasing, with a good euros he would probably be a 65-70 mil player at the age of 21. Could be the guy that breaks the transfer record if he leaves us in a few years.

6090~~~
You have to know that half the price are add ons because he have a talent but noone can know if he will fulfill it.

In Martial case, if he keeps developing he could be one of the best strikers around in a year. People are forgetting just how impressive his stats are if you consider how bad our attack is, goals and assist could be double what they are now if we would have functional attack.

And if he really become one of the best strikers around we will not be talking about add ons but just about whole price which will be ridiculously high, probably 100m+ pounds high and there are not a lot of clubs which can afford that.

Given the new TV deal and our sponsorships we really don't need money anyway so this just bumps the price even higher.

6091~~~
This. And we could have Maureen as manager by then, we could be back competing for major trophies...he could be the next Henry..and Arsenal managed to keep him happy for his best years. With PL money, as Spanish presidents have eluded to in the last 12 months, players leaving for Spain and elsewhere in the coming seasons will become less and less of a problem. It will soon be like leaving Vegas for Blackpool!!

6092~~~
The type of club who would want one of the best strikers in the world could and if we wasn't competitive he would be able to force a move I'm willing to bet, especially when we would likely be loosing money from Adidas anyway.

Anyway its a moot point, anyone who thinks we will be able to hold on to him if we don't get back to being competitive in a few years is crazy

6093~~~
Dude, come on

6094~~~
17 goals this season in all comps so far. Very productive more than we deserve. Looking forward to seeing his development continue .

6095~~~
You are referring to his run against Antonio? Antonio had at least five yards on him, is very fast himself and it was easy to see that Martial was only half bothered. Against Everton, he showed that he is by quite some distance faster than Coleman, who is very fast. 

But you are right that it is with the ball he impresses the most. His bursts when running at pace already is really something. He doesn't run with pace like Giggs could in his younger days, but the way he accelerates past defenders at pace is amazing. Maybe why he isn't that much a threat at counters? He seems to like to build some momentum. His close control is sublime though.

6096~~~
I always get the impression he just couldn't be bothered to sprint, but when he does it's really quick. He was recorded at the fastest speed in the PL along with Vardy so he is pretty damn quick just doesn't look it or doesn't do it enough.

6097~~~
His output this season really is impressive, even in a normal team getting 17 largely from the wing in your debut season is excellent, but he's done it in a team that largely detests scoring goals. And set up a further 10. A lot of similarities to when Rooney joined, really. Fingers crossed he's here as long, and submits fewer transfer requests in the meantime.

6098~~~
Would you rather I pretend to be positive, after that bag of crap last night, never mind the last 3 years? 

Granted, I was probably OTT in this thread last night.

6099~~~
Aside of this being an absolutely unreasonable claim, where would he actually go?
Barca have MSN
Real has Ronaldo in his position, and he'll probably stay for a couple of years. Then they will come knocking, that's for sure
Bayern has a vast array of attacking talents - apart from Ribery and Robben they have Coman and Costa on the flanks and Lewa and Muller up front
PSG? I doubt he prefers them over us - and he obviously likes to play in a more competitive league, you can see it
Atletico or Borussia don't have the money
Most of our domestic competitors are in shambles themselves

6100~~~
Imagine him in a fully functioning Fergie team... Or even in the Hazard role in a Mourinho team. He'd be challenging for POTY. Still think it was criminal that he didn't even make the shortlist for YPOTY when Barkley did.

6101~~~
I didn't realise that this was thing that happened. 

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6102~~~
And coutinho

6103~~~
He could arguably have been on the shortlist for POTY, let alone YPOTY.

6104~~~
Given the precedent we set when buying him + the recent Sanches deal, he ain't going nowhere because no one is paying the £100m+ we would and probably should demand for him.

He is the best outfield performer we've had since van Persie 12/13.

6105~~~
We would turn down £200m. I'm certain of it.

6106~~~
At the time of the voting I think he only had 6 premier league goals and he was looking a bit worn out, he certainly had a quiet patch for a stretch of games around then, now he's come back really strong, I think currently he's playing even better than that dynamite start he had. In all competitions he would belong in the 6 but prem alone not for me.

6107~~~
People arguing for his POTY nomination are acting premature. He just oozes class and potential and already have some world-class attributes (mainly his dribbling), but he still isn't the finished product and Kane, Mahrez, Kante; Vardy, Alli, De Gea (United POTY) - all contributed more to the more successful teams

It's a shame that he didn't get nominated as a YPOTY but, again, it's wrong to use his all-comp stats to hype his league season. His league stats are still fantastic for such a young player (11 + 3 via whoscored), but it's a wrong perspective.

6108~~~

6109~~~
Honestly, I think I would quit watching us if we sold him (not that I think there is any realistic chance of it happening.) Obviously no player is bigger than the club, but that would be so demoralizing....

6110~~~
With the amount we've relied on him, easy to forget the Liverpool goal happened in this season. He seems so mature and has taken on the focal point role so well, it's hard to believe he's only 20. Watched a skills highlight of his season and it's frustrating that his numbers would have been far better if the anyone else performed half as well. Can see him impressing at the Euros with that much talent around him if they give him minutes.

6111~~~
If he stays on the left and Zlatan does come in, he will get an absolute barrowload of assists by having Zlatan in the middle.

6112~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6113~~~
Martial is so good he can ping it off Rooney's legs to score. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6114~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6115~~~
Without him we'd have struggled to crack double figures in the league. He's at the heart of every dangerous attack we manage to conjure up.

6116~~~
Produced the best piece of class on the night.

6117~~~
The kids is going to be the poster boy of the club for many years.
he already did it off his chest, why not his leg too?

6118~~~
Class yet again, he really ups the tempo of our game. Although that isn't exactly hard to do.

6119~~~
What is there left to say. Thank the lord, devil and flying spaghetti monster we've got him. Fantastic season.

6120~~~
I know most of the caf say that he will end up as striker in a couple of years. However, I really enjoy to watch him on the left. I hope we can sign someone that can do the same on the right.

6121~~~
Sane could be that for us imo. Whether or not we can get him is another issue all together, gotta get in before City etc. come sniffing.

6122~~~
He's incredible, playing one two's, taking players on, assisting and scoring goals! 

Can't wait to see him develop further.

PS - how can we see what games he's scored and assisted in? I see other sites have him on 8 assists this season?

6123~~~
Another assist, another win <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6124~~~
We need another one like him on the right.

6125~~~
The amount of comments are getting lower, we are getting used to how good he is, I was worried this would happen. Great for the first goal, great link up for the mata penalty incident too.

6126~~~
It's to be expected, really. Not much to say when you're best player plays to a good standard - most of the De Gea thread is actually about him leaving and not about how good he has been this season.

6127~~~
I can't wait to see Martial with Shaw backing him up next season.

6128~~~
His last month has been incredible, he has been great in every aspect of the game.

6129~~~
His overall stats for the season, notwithstanding Saturday's game, are really really impressive for a first year in a new team especially given the context in which he arrived. More than his stats, his composure, how he dealt with this first year, being over used, the bout of fatigue he had a little while ago, all show huge maturity which bode well for the future. He's going to be world class.

6130~~~
It makes such a difference for an inside forward to be supported by the LB. The reason why Martial got space for his assist was CBJ actually got forward, high up the pitch and stretched the defence out. Our fullbacks aren't risky enough and it means Martial has to do too much. I think that's why Memphis struggled so much too, he used to have Willems flying forward in tandem with him, since Shaw got injured none of them have done a good enough job supporting the attack.

6131~~~
Yeah definitely to be expected. I think we will see a lot more traffic in here after Saturday, see him having a stormer and winning us the FA cup and everyone losing it hopefully.

6132~~~
Looking back at his season it's incredible how he has done really. Arrived with a huge weight on his shoulders with the price tag, new country, new club, totally different league but he hit the ground running and didn't look back. He's our best player along with DDG. You see all of these excuses of players needing to adapt and whilst they are valid on occasions he has shown how special players like him face adversity, take on new challenges and thrive on it. I think he will only get better.

6133~~~
His form the last month has definately stepped up again and that's not just his goals, he's just the heart of anything positive that happens in this team. I have no doubt that if he shows up this weekened the cup is ours.

6134~~~
One of the rare positives in post-Fergie era. If he's that good at the moment, what will he be in a few years time? And when will Real Madrid come and get what they think is theirs by god-given rights?

6135~~~
Seemed to be adding some new elements to his game last night... seemed intent on trying the chip into the box, for example. Will be so exciting to see how this lad develops.

6136~~~
How many goals and assists did Hazard have last season?
17 and 11, if I am not wrong. Martial has just equalled his stats.

6137~~~
19 and 13 according to this: <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.transfermarkt.com/eden-hazard/leistungsdaten/spieler/50202/plus/0?saison=2014" target="_blank">http://www.transfermarkt.com/eden-hazard/leistungsdaten/spieler/50202/plus/0?saison=2014</a>

6138~~~
Ah, I was wrong. Thanks.

Now we all need is Martial to score 2 goals and assist 2 more in the final to match Hazard's best season. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6139~~~
With a much much worse team. Especially going forward. Sky's the limit for this guy.

6140~~~
Yet Hazard gets POTY and Martial doesn't even get nominated for YPOTY.

Not saying Martial should have got POTY, mind.

6141~~~
It's strange isn't it. I haven't seen our players do any sort of chip passes before, not for a long time anyway. All of a sudden Rooney, Martial and Mata are dinking balls left right and centre <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> They really work too, when you've got a deep defence like that it's easier going over than trying to thread it through tiny spaces.

He is just fan-fecking-tastic. How can he be so good at such a young age? Scary to think how good he will be at 26.

We need to buy some proper world class players to match what he can do.

6143~~~
Whoscored

6144~~~
He's been great for his first season, never even thought for once second, when he was transfered, that he was going to perform like this. The best thing about it is that he has many things he can still improve on, the potential is very scary <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6145~~~
He's scarily good at the age of 20. Think it's fair to say there's a potential 30/40-goals-a-season player in him.

6146~~~
That's showing only 5 assists, hasn't included his assists in the FA Cup at all.

6148~~~
And you thought that he was overrated<img alt=":nono:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nono.gif" title="No-no    :nono:"/>. Now, I will take all the credits for his last month, since my "negative" post he has done what I wanted to see from him. Since you are reading me, well done Anthony.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

6149~~~
Yep, Barcelona are using them all the time.

6150~~~
Not overrated but definitely overpriced (which I still think he was).

6151~~~
Which makes me wonder why don't they just do the POTY and YPOTY award at the very end of the season rather than when there is still 2 months to go. Now his form at the tail end of the season goes unnoticed and missed on an award(I believe Martial should have won the YPOTY one). 

He's got stats comparable to Hazard last season which won him the POTY award and similar ones to Mahrez this season(someone needs to check this but I'm sure they aren't that very far off goals and assists stats)

6152~~~
They haven't put his assist up for Bournemouth, they also haven't given him two assists he got in the WH replay.

6153~~~
Mahrez has 17 goals and 10 assists in the league (contributing to 27 goals). Martial has 11 goals and 4 assists in the league (contributing to 15). Mahrez is pretty far off in comparison.

6154~~~
Yeah there's still quite a gap between Mahrez and Martial's stats to be fair.

6155~~~
Mahrez was 17/11 which is sensational really. He missed a couple of penalties too and Vardy took the rest

6156~~~
I think Santoryo is counting all competitions in which yes it is pretty close but Martial has played more games and got good stats in the FA cup.

6157~~~
Yeah you're right, Mahrez is far off in the league but overall they don't seem far apart. Shame the POTY award is for the league only.

By the way what are the best stats overall for players in the Prem. Let's say the top 5 or 10 stats(goals + assists) for Premiere league players this year(all comp). I just want to see how Martial fairs in this category overall. He should be top 5 I'm sure of it.

6158~~~
No way near top 5, Martial is joint 12th in combined goals and assists.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/aiRfdfB.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/aiRfdfB.png"/>

Assists stats do seem to differ across different websites though.

6159~~~
It's just really incredible how good Mahrez/Vardy were this season, just out of the blue they started to play like worldclass players. <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

6160~~~
Amazing what confidence can do.

6161~~~
I was talking overall, not just the league(as mentioned in my previous posts). I believe overall Martial has contributed to 27 goals this season which I think would put him in the top 5 or at least top 10. I think the stats you just showed are League only.

6162~~~
Still you have to put it in perspective. Scoring and assisting in a team that doesn't score much is a feat on it's own. He usually only gets 1 good chance in a game and most of the time he scores that chance. Under a different manager with a better team and playing as the main striker he can have much greater numbers.

6163~~~
His all comps stats would be tied in 4th/5th when compared to others who just have premier league taken into account... so its not exactly a fair comparison.

6164~~~
17 goals, 11 assists (and counting hopefully) is a bloody brilliant return for a 19/20 year old in his first season in the Premier League.

What makes it an even more incredible contribution is the fact that he's playing left wing not striker for a side that doesn't score or create much at all. When you throw in the fact that his game isn't just about output but also his dribbling and ability to beat his man time and time again.. Well what a super first season he's had.

Please build the team around this bloke. If he turns up tomorrow we've got a great chance of winning the cup, let's hope that it can be the first of many medals.

6165~~~
If we win tomorrow it'll be because of him, lets be honest.

6166~~~
Measuring his performance this season needs a lot more than just a look at his stats. Goal scoring and assisting is merely the headline part of his performance. He's also taken a lot of responsibility on his shoulders and far too often looks like the only player willing and able to drive the team forward in a productive way. 

And how do you measure the way he's made the fans feel? How miserable would this team and this season be without him? 

In every qualitative and quantitative measure, he has had a hugely successful first season.

6167~~~

6168~~~

6169~~~

6170~~~
Loves Manchester, special bond with the fans, knows the song, had an 'okay' season and expect better next season.

6171~~~
Scholes criticism? what did he say

6172~~~
He'll retire here. He's a United fan.

6173~~~
Not sure, but seems like from Twitter it was in relation to his non celebration when he scores! If that's it, it's stupid criticism.

6174~~~
The kid has got such a cool, mature head on his shoulders. He's top drawer in every department. Talent, mentality, he's got the lot.

6175~~~
I googled it...Scholes should go back to not speaking

And Scholes - a model professional during his career at Old Trafford - says the 19-year-old doesn't have the right attitude.

"He doesn't look bothered if he misses a chance," Scholes said on BT Sport after <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/manchester-united-0-0-psv-6899782" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">United's 0-0 draw with PSV.</a>

"He doesn't look bothered if he scores a goal. As a centre forward, all you live for is scoring goals, all you want to do is score goals.

"He doesn't look like one of those players to me and maybe they need to go into the transfer market in January for one of them."

6176~~~
Glad he only sees this season as Okay for me, it shows that he feels confident that he's potentially a lot better than what he showed this season. 

Hopefully with him being well aware of how good he is and could potentially be, he pushes that bit further and work even harder to become world class

6177~~~
Basically that he isn't Ruud Van Nistelrooy

6178~~~
Oh ok, that's old news. Remember that at the time.

6179~~~
"Quite happy" with him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6180~~~
I love this man. If he can do this well in such a stagnant team then I cannot wait to see what he can do in a team that's ticking properly, I basically player cam him these days when I'm watching United.

6181~~~
Urgh, Scholes. He's worse for body-language analysis than the Caf x1000.

"Doesn't look bothered if he scores a goal"


Look at all that not giving a shit from Anthony the Robot.

6182~~~
Full interview

6183~~~
"Goal-scoring is what I do & it’s the thing that makes me most happy, so I'm really happy inside." Also, He mentioned before that he prefers to play as striker. LVG is the one who said that Martial is more a winger than striker.

So, why not play him as striker and sign 2 wingers instead? I mean, I like him on the left but it seems that he wants to play up front.

6184~~~
I love how he doesn't go insane. Makes him seem like a stone-cold goal scoring killer. One of the sayings that always stuck with me regarding goal/touch down celebrations was "act like you've been here before". Martial's behavior epitomizes that. He's not fussed about it, because he expects, he knows, he's going to score more, and he's already scored a lot. That doesn't mean he isn't happy and excited, of course he is, but down playing it, that's a fecking dagger to people. Dude just tore you apart, and he non-nonchalantly scores and doesn't celebrate. As a defender, I can only imagine the ice in your veins when a dude does that to you.

6185~~~
Totally agree.  Add in his age, massive potential with a mentality like his.

6186~~~
Its a fair point about the striker position, if we are struggling to get a top ST in, maybe we could think about getting another LW as that position seems to have more talent in the market place.

6187~~~
His debut goal is my favourite moment of the season. Whatever negative criticism our club is (rightly) currently getting, they undoubtedly got this decision very right. If he maintains a linear progression he will be one of the top three attackers in the world in three or four years

6188~~~
I dont really like him as a striker, I dont think he's got that instinct and patience in his game, having to wait the entire game for a few moments. He's great on the ball, taking on defenders, creating space, linking up with other players in the middle. We need a new right winger.

6189~~~
Think it will be just as good to get a top class LW and push Martial on top. If we consider a top striker in, who is available and realistic, and to what price? Not too many options

6190~~~
Especially if van Gaal stays. He is too talented and needs to have the ball as much as possible. To quote an old legend Bixente Lizarazu: "If we don't know what to do with the ball, we always give it to Zidane! He can always handle it!". Thats how good/important Martial is for us atm

6191~~~
I think I agree with this. He's got so much more to his game than scoring goals. I don't think there are many better players around right now for making those direct runs towards goal from out wide whilst dragging the ball past two or three defenders. I can't remember the last time we had a player who beat defenders so easily. I don't think even Ronaldo was as good at it as Martial is. And as a wide forward he will still get plenty of opportunities to score goals, because he is so direct and just literally runs towards the goal.

6192~~~
Completely agree. His movement in the box isn't good enough to have to rely on at the moment. Rashford's is comparatively better, even now. He's a different beast when on the ball outside of it and that wide left berth should be nailed down both at club and international level. He's the perfect wide forward, really.

6193~~~
Good post. Even more impressive when you consider only 1 of 17 goals was a penalty. While he has had some indifferent games, they've pretty much all been when the entire team has under-performed, he's never been close to being our worst player. And still only 20 years old! It's frightening to think how good this guy could become.

6194~~~
Scholes doesnt half spout a lot of shite.
I too prefer him on the wing. He needs to jave the ball as much as possible.

6195~~~
Not only do I agree with the above on the left forward/striker debate, I think it's probably a bit easier to sign a quality no.9 than it probably would be to sign two wingers - left and right.

6196~~~
Whatever LvG says now, he signed Martial as a striker. Memphis has flopped so he is covering his arse with these comments. 

He was very lucky that Rashford stepped up

6197~~~
Scholes is a poor pundit and has come out with some bizarre comments since he got involved with the media. Thierry Henry never looked particularly bothered during quite a few of his goal celebrations and he was an okay player, so I think Martial will be fine.

6198~~~
Really? See if that was the case I'd agree but apart from Ibrahimovic I don't think there's many top class STs available. LW is a much wider market than both ST and RW in my opinion,. That being said I agree that Martial has shown more off the left than up top but that's mainly because our stiker gets 3 touches a game so he's wasted there. I don't really mind which way we go as long as we recruit a couple of top class attackers around him.

6199~~~
Who do you see as a realistic left winger with the pace, dribbling ability and goal scoring that Martial possesses? Beyond Ibrahimovic there are a few good goalscorers who are below the 'top class' bracket but would still definitely work great; Icardi, Lacazette, Batshuayi, Higuain etc...

6200~~~
That's not joint 12th, it's joint 23rd. There are 22 players with more than Martial.

6201~~~
Yeh I don't know I just always get the impression that LW seems more stocked (might be my imagination tho). We could push the boat out for someone like Reus..... Actually you know what I take it back can't think of any LW <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. As you were...

6202~~~
I like him on the wing as it better suits his attributes, can't imagine him as a centre forward as he doesn't hold the ball up much, don't know if he is bad at it but he usually just picks up the ball and charges at defenders and as a centre forward you have to wait a little longer for your team mates to catch up. He doesn't play off the shoulder of the last defender either, he usually picks the ball up from relatively deep and makes his runs, his movement off the ball will get stronger naturally and if it does that could be worth an extra 5-10 goals a season.

6203~~~
Maybe that's because he plays on the wing, though. The chicken or the egg...

6204~~~
Yeah could be, either way as up top isn't his usual position it would take him a while to fully adapt to the position.

6205~~~
He holds the ball perfectly, you just have to watch his game against PSG this season.

6206~~~
IMO. He's equally as good out wide or central.

It just happened that our wingers were crap and Rashford stepped up in the central role. He was utilized where he was needed most, not necessarily were he was at his most dangerous.

6207~~~
Just watched the individual highlights, he does it well a few times but generally he turned ran at his man and lost the ball.

6208~~~
He's going to boss the final today and i'll love every minute of it<img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

6209~~~
No pressure at all, Eric.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.espnfc.co.uk/manchester-united/story/2877089/manchester-uniteds-anthony-martial-like-the-brazilian-ronaldo-cantona" target="_blank">http://www.espnfc.co.uk/manchester-...ny-martial-like-the-brazilian-ronaldo-cantona</a>

6210~~~
He isn't a good enough finisher or natural enough goal threat to start up top yet for me. Rashford looks like he has more goals in him at present. Playing outside allows him to carry and beat player's on one one also cutting and shooting on his right, which is his only reliable finish. But from interviews he seems to be working on this part of his game.

6211~~~
One of his poorer games for us, got no change out of Ward but was unlucky with his header that hit the post.

6212~~~
Zaha and Ward did well to keep him quiet all game. Due a poor game, however, others turned up, today.

6213~~~
Triple teamed for 120 minutes. Unlucky with his header

6214~~~
Pretty much that. And the number of times I saw him make a darting run in behind when Rooney was on the ball, who then proceeded to take another touch before laying it off to Carrick...

6215~~~
Yeah Zaha and Ward done really well to double mark and track his runs. Even with a poor game, he had a header off the post and still made some decent runs into the box and played some incisive passes. 

We need to find ways to free him up. 

Usually it's by having better players and/or a better tactical set up.

6216~~~
It was similar with Mata on the other side. The passing in the centre of the pitch was terrible today. It was like they would pass it between themselves until every player bar the GK and CB's had caught up with play.

Martial was gettiing the ball either too late allowing Crystal Palace to regroup, or not at all. He looked frustrated.

6217~~~
I honestly think we will see more of this where he gets double teamed, but he really wasnt helped at all by our Left back. If we had somebody like Shaw (or prime evra), they would have taken advantage of the space being left to drive with the ball. He hardly had any overlaps or somebody to pull it back to who was going to run on with the ball.

6218~~~
There was one point he reached the box, and Palace had a lad at either side of him, one in front, and one behind, literally boxed in with about a foot of space on all sides. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6219~~~
He'll be better off next season with Shaw hopefully back giving him an outlet as well as hopefully some other threats in the side.

6220~~~
He didn't look fully fit to me.

6221~~~
This

They had three players marking him pretty much the whole game, not much he could do tbf. If we played and actual LB, that side would have created a lot more problems.

6222~~~
Think he was poor, tired as feck though, understandable, should've never played the match on Tuesday and just let him rest for Saturday but what's new. 

Overall, a fantastic year, our only spark of hope throughout the season, anything we build from now on should probably built around him.

6223~~~
Looked knackered, so year, definitely one of his poor games for us. Great header, though.

6224~~~
He was perceived as the biggest danger for Palace and they treated him like that. But his relatively poor performance wasn't only about that. He looked a bit tired and it wasn't his day as well. A combination of factors (including no luck) contributed to him not being great yesterday but it's normal. He's had a great season for a youngster coming from abroad and from a weaker league too. 17 golas and 11 assists! Isn't that statistically better than Rooney's first season at United? A genuine question?

6225~~~
Put it another way, Martial was involved in 40% of the goals we scored this season in all competitions.

6226~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pADzLTV28gI?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Fantastic debut season - even more impressive to see all of these in a row.

6227~~~
He's so composed slotting those in low past the keeper. Makes it look effortless.

6228~~~
I fecking love the bastard!

6229~~~
I seriously wonder what his going rate would be in this day and age, considering the age and potential.

When you see people like Lukaku touted around for about £60m then it really should be £150m.

6230~~~
No. I'm not watching those cut-off videos. This needs to stop.

6231~~~
I love that he scored quite a few goals from almost zero angle, when it looks like he has no other option but to cross it or to make a pass.

6232~~~
An incredible year from a very gifted player.

6233~~~
A very gifted player whom if play under the right manager and guidance, could blossom into a really special player. He has the balance, guile, speed of thought and close control. He has that scoring instinct but his movement is not there compared to the likes of Chica. Let alone RvN. But where was RvN at his age? He can only get better this guy. Love him already <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6234~~~
Ballon D'Or material.

6235~~~
It's the assists from the line in that video that impress me the most and is why I think he should make the left his position, rather than playing centrally. He's so good at beating his man and getting in to that position and then playing it in to the right area. A young Scholes would've scored about 30 a season playing with him.

6236~~~
Zlatan will take the no.9 shirt, Martial will be given the no.7 according to Neil Custis in the Sun.

6237~~~
so then i guess the opposite will be true.

6238~~~
There is no doubting his potential is insane and his been unplayable at times this year but f*ck me, some people need to steady on a bit in this thread...

6239~~~
I see a mix of Henry and The brazilian Ronaldo in him. Can see him putting up Messi/ronaldo/suarez figures soon.

6240~~~
And your honest opinion?

6241~~~
You're right, he should be aiming to top those numbers.

6242~~~
Just imagine him linking up with Ibrahimovic on the break next season under Mou <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 
Think he's going to get over 20 goals next season for sure, as long as he avoids injuries again. And that's just with him coming off the wing like he has this season. Ibra will probably be our main goalscorer but I can see Martial getting plenty and loads of assists as well.

Will be interesting to see his role at the euro's. I'm hoping he starts and has a big impact but it's not guarantee that he'll be a starter given they have Payet, Coman, Griezmann to compete with. If he does I can see him being one of the stars of the tourny though, given that they have a great shot at winning it.

6243~~~
AM7? I like it.

7AM <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I'm a bit worried at the moment that the 7 has been cursed.

6247~~~
I can see him having a difficult second season, but that doesn't mean we should be any less excited (hell, even Messi had a difficult 07-08 season by his standards).

6248~~~
What makes you say that? I think he will go from strength to strength. In a functional team he will easily sack 20 goals next year I reckon.

6249~~~
Can see him thriving in the counter-attacking style.

6250~~~
In the right counter setup, he could be lethal. Really needs to put in overtime in training to get his finishing right.

And Mourinho is just the right guy he needs right now. Someone to boost his ego to the next level. Jose will be saying he is best player in the world in no time.

6251~~~
we should build the team around him. he's that brilliant.

6252~~~
Higher expectations from the fans, less prominent role in the side (usually a good thing, but people will be less accepting of his mistakes if the ball was supposed to go to Ibra rather than Rashford and it's possible if we're not abject he may even be rotated), won't have a full pre-season because of the Euros and probably switch off a little bit due to complacency.

6253~~~
I said it early last year and people kept banging on about him being too young etc. The kid is the business right now, we need to learn to squeeze the most out of him.

6254~~~
age has nothing to do with it for me. it's all about talent. He is so good that we should maximise his ability as much as possible. he will get us all the goals if this is done. Relieve his defensive duties get him in positions to run at defenders and he will score goals for fun.

6255~~~
Perhaps I think this guy is just ridiculously good, in fact I think he's better now than people realise and the only reason he isn't already rated higher is because he's so young and people think he has potential to be even better. Next season will be the year for Anthony Martial

6256~~~

6257~~~
Hopefully it's just a minor thing that doesn't see him even in doubt of missing the Euros, needless to say!

For next season though, no reason he won't be more of a threat, bearing in mind he often picked the ball up with next to no movement around him and he had to try and beat everyone himself

6258~~~
Would ruin the euros for me if he doesn't play.

6259~~~
I wouldn't mind. Weakens france. Rests him for nwxt season.

6260~~~
Couldn't agree more, lll be watching every France game just to see martial

Our fastest player last season.

6263~~~
Hoping this isn't a big deal.

6264~~~
That's only our players, right?

Shucks, for a second there I thought we owned the top 5 fastest, clocked out of the entire Prem....that was until I saw Smalling's name on the list <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

(not that Smalling is a slouch either btw).

6265~~~
Yeah, just ours.

6266~~~
I hope he's fit and goes to the euros.

France have a good chance at winning it, itf be great for his confidence to be a part of that.

6267~~~
I think Martial was second behind Vardy in the league though, wasn't he? Sure I read that somewhere.

6268~~~
Surprised by Valencia not being there - he seems to run like a cheetah.

6269~~~
You could well be right NF. I haven't seen that list, but it wouldn't surprise me to see Vardy topping it.

Good omens for us though. Another 2-3 quick players and our team looks much pacier than the dinosaur it's resembled over recent years.

6270~~~
Smalling's suppose to be our fastest players if interviews through the years are to be believed.

Also I'm fairly sure the top recorded speed each season is always near 37KM/H, so our players are very close to the fastest.

6271~~~
Yeah Smalling is quite fast, so too Rooney apparently <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

Just found it, he was:

Vardy's top speed was 35.44 to Martial's 35.4

I find these top speed things a bit pointless, but still, nice to know.

He needs someone else to rotate with. He played 64 games last season for club and country which was the most of any player in Europe and he's only 20. He needs to rest sometimes.

6280~~~
Memphis hopefully

6281~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> so far. Roasted the RB every time, and 1 great backheel too.

6282~~~
Martial having a good game, mainly because he is playing as inside forward (433). Also he is surrounded by Evra, Pogba and Griezmann (instead of Fellaini, Rojo and Lingard). I hope Memphis improves so he can have a decent cover.

6283~~~
Seriously? Wow.

6284~~~

6285~~~
Ended up playing more centrally late in the game. I hope he gets the nod on the left in the EUROs, though.

Pogba is a very good player, isn't he? The complete package.

6286~~~
I think he misses out because he was hardly getting the ball after a good first twenty mins but nearing the last twenty of the second half there were fewer runs and less attacking intent when he was on.

6287~~~

6288~~~
Cool!
Best player after De Gea this season. The ones that LvG could not affect.

Watching the video like "we never went for Matuidi.. that's sad"

6289~~~
I've missed him so much since the end of the season, he just is so exciting, with United we may not be up to much at the minute but we have him, not sure what is going to get me through the England games.

6290~~~
Perhaps it would make you feel better if we 'went for Matuidi' so that we can be told to feck off by PSG. That's exactly what would happen.

6291~~~
wow looked amazing here

6292~~~
Hopefully we sign another young talented winger. Maybe that Ounas guy to give him some breathing space. Have zero faith in Memphis.

6293~~~
Great, thanks!

6294~~~
Matuidi played for Saint-Etienne before PSG and that's what I 'm talking about.
He was well known for his tenacity since he was a kid. He was playing along Dabo, Payet, Mirallas and Gomis. A few seasons back, before moving to other clubs, their value was well known, as Saint-Etienne players. I had a close eye on some of them - against Olympiakos.

6295~~~
Looking forward to him in the euros.... think he will kill it. Not even sure if he is starting but he really should, and if he does, then I have no doubt about him playing a huge role.

No hack journos linking him with PSG or Real yet?

6299~~~
I dont worry about PSG. Sadly I give it a maximum of two years before that crooked vulture Perez starts talking about how he admire him in the media, but that an agreement has to be reached first.

Classic Perez and that parasitic club.

6305~~~
Well we should offer him new contract before all talks start and not to wait when its 2 years left like we used to.

6306~~~
Yes, and we are in a great position to do that since if I am not mistaken he is reported to be on under 100k\week. Leaves plenty of room for increase.

6307~~~
My report has him on only £65k/week basic.

6308~~~
This. If you look at how chelsea handled Hazard, they give him a new contract every 1-2 years I think. That's why even madrid can't approach him regardless of their current league position.

6309~~~
Yer that's what I have read to. He wants 100k a week apparently I think at somepoint t this season it will be increased to around that.

6310~~~
Probably my favourite player after De God. I truly hope he can kick on next season under Mourinho and reach the hieghts we all think he can get to.

6311~~~
He needs a bit of rest. He's played so much football over the past year. He's only going to have what, a 2 week break after Euros?

6312~~~
Is it true that he has played the most games out of everyone in Europe?

6313~~~
He'll really need a breather after the euros.  Can't see him maintaining his form from the last season,  given the expectations and fatigue they would likely have set it.

6314~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> It's like he evolved, if we get this Martial next season then we're all in for a treat!

6315~~~
I promised myself that If I ever got to the mains my first post will be on Anthony.I am living the dream right now<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>. Lurking around here and on our rivals' forums was especially fun this past season because of Martial.

The joy he gave people here when he scored against liverpool on his debut was unbelievable. Most of you here confessed to scaring a spouse, Child or pet half to death from celebrating that goal.

Secondly,it was pure joy observing the denial of his talent from our rivals. First they said he was lucky with the bounce of the ball against liverpool. But the young man proceeded to skin seasoned rightbacks one after the other. Then they said that the defenders always underestimate him because he is still new. Then they said the problem was that most of the defenders were scared of his speed and could not defend properly as a result.

 Eventually it bacame stupid for anyone to argue against his talent so they started calling us a two man team. You read statements like .,.... <i>"if it wasnt for Martial and De Gea they would have been relegated before ASton Villa" 
</i>
I just grin every time i see this because they are finally accepting that the young man is going places.

ps. That clip of Martin Tyler Jizzing himself with the.. <i>Ohhhhh Yesss!!!... </i>should be in every football show's opening montage next season

6316~~~
<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

If that's true we need to sign a contract extension with him asap! He would should be on atleast £150k/week.

6317~~~
We shouldn't just give him £150k just for the sake of it, that sets a very dangerous precedent. 
Not even Ronaldo or Messi were getting that much at that age.

As long as he stays we will reward him with plenty of money down the years, we're hardly broke.

6318~~~
I still think that Martial has to be our CF. He's very good as a left forward but he's got the potential to be world class as leading the attack.

6319~~~
Football changed a lot since they were 20 y.o. though. Martial has to be at least on £100k.

6320~~~
He doesn't <b>have</b> to be on £100k. Times haven't changed that much, the only players that come to mind on that much money are Sterling, Hazard & Gotze. Neymar could be included but I think he was 21 when he signed for Barca. There could be more, but that small sample shows that it's not exactly that common to be paying that much for players at that age.

Martial has expressed how much he loves playing for United, it's a dream and he wishes to be here for many more years. 
Why should we have to pay him at least £100k? He's bound to a contract at our club. And we can match every other club that attempts to entice him with higher wages.

When contract renewals come up next year, then yes he's likely to get a much bigger increase in wages, but for now there's no reason and will just set a bad precedent for our wage structure.

6321~~~
Nice. First United player since Rooney in 2010 or 11?

6322~~~
He was doing that regularly for us. No movement around him in our team which means more players marked him.

6323~~~
First mains post, hopefully it'll be sensible. 

IMO he should only play as a CF if we manage not to land a world class player for that position(which would be terrible for Jose/Ed) . His key strength lies in beating his man and creating space for himself to get a cutback or shot away. He will not be getting any such joy centrally. Also, his shooting seems to be a relatively weaker aspect of his game.
Up front we need a hitman, almost a Ruud kind of player which i dont think is available in the market which is why Zlatan is on our radar as he's closest to what is needed.

No doubt he has the potential to play up top but most of his goals in the season gone by have come from the left inside-forward position. Also, playing him centrally means lesser opportunities for Rashford. Playing him on the left is a win-win situation for all.

6324~~~
Age is just a number and is irrelevant. What matters is his role in the team and his importance. £150k isn't very different to what Young makes and Martial is much more important to the team than Young. And it wouldn't set a dangerous precedent as he deserves it based on his current performances, not expected future performances as in the case of some other young players. 

As you said we are the richest club in the world, and I would hate to lose another superstar player to other clubs just because they could pay him higher.

6325~~~
This is one of the reasons I really want Ibra.
People act like his arrival would slow down the development of Rashford/Martial/Lingard while I think it's the exact opposite. Teams will focus on the big Z, they just have to.
That gives Martial or Rashford so much more space, I'm getting excited only thinking about it.
Marking Mata and Depay was, let's be honest, one of the more relaxing jobs for Premier League defenders this year.

Ibra is not the fastest, but you can't give him time or space, otherwise he'll do Zlatan-things.

Martial will play anyway, it's only about splitting the opponent's focus.
I also believe that 30 games in all competitions isn't necessarily worse for your development than 45 games, which would be the case for Rashford.

6326~~~
Naturally, given that's where he played for the vast majority of the season. Though I do agree with your sentiment, I'd like to see him stay wide, though wide in a 4-3-3, rather than a 4-2-3-1. I know it's perhaps getting into semantics, but if he is playing as a wide forward with virtually no defensive duty, and with a midfield 3 behind him to cover, then I believe we'd see the best of him. That's in contrast to 4-2-3-1, where, given there'd be an advanced midfielder, a bit more defensive duty is imposed upon the wide players.

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>Top 5 Premier League Frenchmen 2015/16 | Anthony Martial (Manchester United)</b>
</span>
Here, in the third instalment of a five part series by <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/JGBoulger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jeffrey Gamby Boulger</a>, GFFN lists our top 5 outfield Frenchmen in the Premier League this season in the build-up to EURO 2016. In 3rd position, Manchester United’s Anthony Martial.

<b>3: Anthony Martial</b>

Manchester United have endured a hugely frustrating season, finishing below neighbours Manchester City, crashing out of Europe firstly at the Champions League group stage, and then with defeat to bitter rivals Liverpool in the Europa League, all while consistently losing key players in an injury ravaged season book-ended by their recent F.A. Cup triumph.

Unfortunately it is a hollow victory that does little to paper over the cracks of Louis van Gaal’s hugely underwhelming time at the Theatre of Dreams.

However, there were brief moments of light in an otherwise pitch black season of disappointment under the totalitarian regime of the notorious Dutchman.

And nowhere is this more evident than with the emergence of the hugely talented Anthony Martial.

A crippling sense of boredom and lack of spontaneity has blossomed at Old Trafford during Van Gaal’s unpopular reign, but the young superstar, surely destined for greatness, has been one of the few success stories in an otherwise turgid campaign.

From the first moment the little Frenchman stepped out onto the hallowed turf at Old Trafford to make his debut in September, and proceeded to make a mockery of Liverpool’s Martin Škrtel with a stunning strike on his winning debut, he’s been loved by fans and critics ever since.

Indeed, while United stuttered to a 5th place finish that flattered to deceive, and the team occasionally threatened to shake free from the shackles of the boredom that defined their recent identity under van Gaal, one of the only outfield players to genuinely impress has been Martial.

The Frenchman was supposedly bought for the future he will undoubtedly enjoy in years to come, and the potential that will surely see him amongst the elite talents of his generation. He was never intended to be thrust into the limelight and become such a sudden influential figure in a team so sorely lacking genuine firepower.

But despite his tender age, Martial has responded spectacularly. His dream debut instantly endeared him to the United fans and he was also pivotal in their FA Cup semi-final victory against Everton, with an assist for the first goal by Marouane Fellaini and then scoring an added-time winner to secure his club’s place in the final where they defeated Crystal Palace, again in added-time.

Evidently Martial is a player of genuine substances and potential. Aside from his blistering pace and close control, Martial possesses a remarkable ability to carry the ball at speed and his dribbling enables him to glide past players with astonishing ease.

The Frenchman’s dynamism is there for all to see: his touch is excellent and his technique is palpable. While others have wilted this season, Martial has been left to provide one of the only genuine attacking threats for United and it is a role he is learning to fulfil expertly despite his age.

He is by no means the finished article, but with his best years ahead of him, he already possesses the most crucial and fundamental qualities to help him push on and become the talent expected of him – simply put, he causes problems for defenders and has the ability to make a difference in games.

And in his maiden campaign, his performances have already garnered him significant adulation and acclaim.

In September he was named Premier League Player of the Month, the third-youngest player to receive the award after Micah Richards and Michael Owen, while in December he was awarded the Golden Boy as Europe’s best under-21 player.

And the good news for both club and country is that the scope for Martial to still improve further is eye-watering.

So much so, that compatriot and fellow United legend Eric Cantona has compared the forward to Brazilian former Ballon d’Or winner Ronaldo. The Frenchman told MUTV:

<i>“He’s very mature for his age. I think he’s the same kind of player as Ronaldo. Of course Ronaldo is a Brazilian, but he’s as strong as him. Martial is skilful, he wants to score goals and he has good vision.”</i>

And with an average Whoscored.com rating of 7.24, the highest of any United player, it’s not just fans, pundits and former players alike that have taken notice of the Frenchman’s meteoric rise.

Martial scored an impressive 11 goals in just 28 league appearances this season, most of them important match winners, as well as receiving three separate Man of the Match awards.

Indeed, the stats also confirm that we could be witnessing the emergence of a new superstar, and a deserved entry in our Premier League Top 3.

6328~~~
Guessing Payet and Kante will be the top 2?

6329~~~
I think Milner is no 1.

6330~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6331~~~
The kid is just 20. What on earth are you talking about. If he can replicate another season like this and then he can start looking at 120,000. Such a young player should not be earning that amount by any stretch. He has such a long time to establish himself and in 4 years time could be earning 200,000 and above if he is worldclass which he probably will be. For now 150,000 is too much for a 20 year old. Young is only getting that high based on retirement wages and what he has probably accomplished.

6332~~~
In 4 years time I expect him to be nearer 300k than 200k

6333~~~
He can also move fast and still retain possession.

6334~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

He can shift and not lose the ball aswell

6335~~~
Not yet released on their website, but very likely.

I don't know if they consider Mahrez as a French player here <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/> (dual nationality)

6336~~~
Can't wait to watch him tomorrow. Deschamps should do something stupid like putting him on the bench.

6337~~~
Sadly I don't think he is a starter anymore with that overrated junk payet and his damn setpieces. I do undestand the demand for players like payet especially when you have Giroud in the team. Setpieces are so cruicial in games against opposition who sit back and so Payet will be given the nod against Martial.

6338~~~
Him getting injured and missing those few warm up games for France screwed him over. While he was missing those games, Payet was busy impressing and probably nailed himself a starting place over Martial <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Oh well, hope he comes on at some point in France first game.

6339~~~
Got a feeling this tournament will be a huge disappointment for him. Payet was outstanding, Griezmann is their best player and Giroud seems to be set in stone up front. Today Deschamps' madness killed him. There was hardly any space up front, he barely received any balls and barely received a chance to impress. Shame really, but it is what it is.

6340~~~
He wasn't tonight!

6341~~~
Of course not but in overall ability he is. Besides, when replacing Griezmann, Deschamps seems to prefer Coman anyways, as they're more alike.

6342~~~
Not sure I agree full stop anyway. He is no star at international level IMO.

The interesting thing was Pogba coming off for Martial as that let Payet play in his best position, from which he scored an unbelievable goal. It will be interesting to see if Deschamp's decides to drop Pogba.

6343~~~
Awful tonight. Didn't even notice him until 80+min.

6344~~~
Don't think he'll drop Pogba. He seems to like the 4-3-3, unless I'm mistaken.

6345~~~
Pogba did well in the first half and they hardly created anything after his substitution either. If anything, the field seemed congested. Evra completely ruining Martial's run by running into his path was a prime example of that.

How is Griezmann not a star at the international level?

6346~~~
What has he ever done of note at international level?

6347~~~
I assume you mean national team level because technically the Champions League is international level as well and he has performed there. I thought he was solid at the WC, which was his first big tournament for France. This tournament will reveal more about him. His abilities still can't be denied.

6348~~~
In the UK the CL is 'European' level, the only international level is the national team competitions. He is a great player for AM for sure.

6349~~~
I dont see the use of Matuidi specially when playing against the team that are more focused on seating back and France are supposed to take initiative against.He should start on left with Payet going behind Giroud. Problem with France is they dont have a midfielder who can dictate the game for 4-3-3 to work and let pogba play further forward where he could be more effective.

6350~~~
Matiudi is over kill against rubbish sides.

6351~~~
Came on today and played as a striker essentially. Did get a few chances but hardly made anything off it. With payet in form hard to see him start, which may not be a bad thing from united POV

6352~~~
If Deschamps had the balls, he'd drop Pogba in the next game and play Payet centrally, leaving space for Martial on the left. I expect they'll start the same though, don't need to be too expansive now that they have 3 points in the bag.

6353~~~
Played on the left.

6354~~~
The lineup makes more sense to me as well but as long as they're winning I doubt Deschamps will change the lineup.

6355~~~
No. In your opinion maybe.

6356~~~
Yup..another issue though is griezmaan is basically a 2nd striker and not sure how effective he will be from right. I guess it will be too big a call for manager to drop him and play someone else there though.

6357~~~
He didn't do much tonight but neither did anyone except for Payet going forward. 

Think he'll start one of the group matches and he'll just need to take his chance. Or he'll be first offensive sub of the bench.

6358~~~
Kante, Coman, Payet need to play no matter what. For me Martial and Pogba are potentially their best players when in form. 

Against a top side. . 


Weaker sides..

6359~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6360~~~
Finally someone sensible.<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

6361~~~
He came on in the 77th min...

6362~~~
I'm fully convinced by Coman. He is a stunning talent.. impresses me everytime and I see a lot of growth still left in his game. He's got the potential to be best RW in the world.

6363~~~
Sarcasm is pointless.

6364~~~
Looks like another bench role in the next game. What a fecking shame.

6365~~~
Wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if he didn't play too much.

Read somewhere back in this thread that no player in Europe played more games than he did the past season. 

Hopefully gets a chance and takes it though.

6366~~~
Yeah I'm hoping he stays on the bench for a couple. Comes off the bench to score a couple of winners in the knockoutsame and then starts from there.

6367~~~
He'll start against Albania I bet

6368~~~
Isn't there a rumour that Deschamps is planning to drop Griezmann and Pogba, and play a 4-2-3-1 with Coman and Martial wide and Payet #10 for the Albania game? I swear I saw some journalist tweet that.

6369~~~
Starts tonight <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6370~~~
Boom I was right.

Bet he scores.

6371~~~
Who *** Deschamps drop?

6372~~~
Where does it say? Don't they release an lineups an hour before the game?

6373~~~
See above mate. From the France Albania thread.

6374~~~
That's the perfect line up. Correct decision IMO.

6375~~~
This is his opportunity to cement his name in the team for the rest of the tournament. Great match for our boy to make his name in international football.

6376~~~
Griezmann and Pogba

They usually do but sometimes get leaked earlier

6377~~~
Martial knows this is his chance. Expect an everton final performance straight from the get go.

6378~~~
Goodie. Was about to skip this one until the XI was announced.

6379~~~
Go martial - Show them what you are capable of

6380~~~
Not a great start

6381~~~
Probably the worst I've seen him play, I hope he sees the game out though because he always has a moment of magic in him.

6382~~~
Everything he touches goes to shit, has to be said. The worst game since joining us.

6383~~~
Looks a bag of nerves, didn't realise our Tony has nerves.

6384~~~
He IS human.

6385~~~
Patience, Grasshopper.

6386~~~
He needs to stop dribbling and be the only one who is trying something, they are doubling him every time he has the ball.

6387~~~
Wtf is Memphis doing in Martial's body

6388~~~
He just doesn't look comfortable or happy, I think he's homesick for Manchester <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

6389~~~
He's tired. Needs a good rest before the start of next season.

6390~~~
Very poor half. Dispossessed nearly everytime he ran at his fullback.

6391~~~
Yeah let's hope Feance go out in the first knock out rounds. He needs a proper holiday.

6392~~~
He struggles with the pitch also.

6393~~~
At least he is involved. The Albanian RB Hysaj he is up against is a quality player.

6394~~~
Because he's almost always very good for us, it's strange to see him not playing so great, but he is human, after all.

6395~~~
Martial off, Pogba on

Hopefully he has a better performance next time

6396~~~
Feck you, Deschamps.

6397~~~
Haven't been watching it closely so I might be harsh on him but he looked like he was having real trouble making his mind up at times. I suppose it's a reminder of his age.

Not surprised to see him hooked. I would have been very frustrated with him if I'm Deschamps.

6398~~~
Non performance from him. Forget and move on.

6399~~~
As long as he is playing well for us i am satisfied

6400~~~
Poor lad, breaking his balls trying to make something happen but it's gone all arse ways.

6401~~~
Has had a lot of those performances for us if we're being honest. Needs a rest and a lot more rotation next season.

6402~~~
What youngster who has been rotated/rested turned into a world beater?

He needs to play and perfect his game, not sit on the bench. He was actually trying tonight, and who knows it might have worked out in the second half.

6403~~~
Im still amazed that people dont think youngsters can afford a bad half. You would think Messi and Ronaldo were turning out killer perfomances at 20, and they are the best of the best to have ever done it.

6404~~~
Football fans are ridiculous these days.

6405~~~
I can't even remember the last time Ronaldo had a good game at an international tournament.

6406~~~
At his age he should be getting 20 minute cameos when the opposition are flagging, not getting hooked at half-time for being one of many poor performers. It's shite management by Deschamps imo.

6407~~~
The worst performance I've seen from him. But he's still young and has a long international career ahead of him. And everyone, no matter how good they are, has a bad day at the office. There's nothing to worry about. Although it seems to me that fans in general are becoming far less patient and expect heroics from young players. The hype for both Martial and Rashford on this forum is quite ridiculous at times. I know it's easy to get excited but there <i>will</i> be bad performances from them from time to time.

6408~~~
He was our top goalscorer in his debut season. 

Yea, let's drop him.

6409~~~
Yeah I'm sure the team will benefit a lot from benching our most lethal winger.

6410~~~
He did that in the first game, and then rewarded him with a start after a nice cameo, and he had an absolutely shocking first half, worst player on the pitch.

How is that bad management?

6411~~~
He didn't play well but that's not true at all.

6412~~~
I didn't watch the first half but by the sounds of it Martial was pretty poor. Being taken off at halftime won't help his confidence either. Given the nature of the tournament, I doubt Deschmaps will trust him very much going forward hence making the entire EC a waste of time for him. Shame really, but it is what it is. Perhaps he has simply been overrated on this board.

6413~~~
Agree.

Everytime he's had a bad game this season he apparently needs a rest.

6414~~~
First time I've ever seen nerves effect him. He's only human afterall.

6415~~~
Or, you know, he just didn't have a good half and that's the anomaly rather than the full league season.

6416~~~
Ronaldo?

He was managed perfect by Fergie when he joined us. In his first season, Fergie sent him on 3 weeks holiday in january to relax. In his second season he got a 2 week break too. That's the best example.

6417~~~
He was the best and most exciting attacker in our team. A team that lacked any good attacking play. We would have to be be very weird not to rate him.

6418~~~
He was also poor in the first game. Read the comments in here and you have to think he was just downright horrible and given that he was the one to be taken off at halftime appears to confirm that. We'll see how he does the rest of the way, if he gets many more chances, which I doubt.

6419~~~
That is exactly why we might tend to overrate him. He seemed so good in comparison to our remaining attackers, but our remaining attackers were simply so poor that Martial looked better than he currently is.

6420~~~
I love how confident you are in spite of having already said you didn't even watch the game ffs. 

As for the first game he got a 20 minute cameo at the end of the game

6421~~~
He wasn't that bad, France are shit to be fair.

No creativity at all in the centre of the park without Pogba on.
Kante and Matuidi are good at breaking up play, rubbish at everything else tonight.

Plus Giruid is being his usual terrible self again.

6422~~~
They are shit without him too, neither of their forwards was any better. 

Yep, but ut's understandable, nothing was going on for him.

But you gotta love him for trying all the time even when having an off day, altough if he didn't he would probably stayed on, but then he is that kind of player and people like him for that.

6423~~~
No he wasn't.

6424~~~
I love Martial but why sugarcoat it?  His passing accuracy was the worst in blue, at just 66.7%, he kept mis-controlling the ball, slipping etc.. basically nothing worked for him.

That's why he was taken off.

6425~~~
Ronaldo was 2 years younger than Ronaldo in those seasons you are talking about. Martial is at a much more advance stage in his development than Ronaldo was in his first year with us - he is older and more physically developed. 

Ronaldo played 40 games in his first year with us, went to the Euros and played every game for Portugal, came back and played 50 games for us the following year.

6426~~~
Not true at all, had a decent little cameo and earned his start this evening.

6427~~~
Why is this shite always lazily whipped out when a player has a bad half/game. Wonder who'll get the overrated treatment next for having a bad game. Not sure there's many good players left for the Caf to target tbh.

6428~~~
It's not sugar-coating to say he wasn't the worst player on the pitch. 

He has a poor half but he was at least trying to make things happen and trying to open the game up.  

Matiudi should have been the one to go off, bring on Pogba to greater a better link between midfield and attack and allow Martial to concentrate on what he does best.

6429~~~
I guess so, but at the same time as the over rating is happening the opposite could be true too. Look at Pogba, he is not playing like a 100m player is he?

6430~~~
I was desperate for him to be amazing, desperate, and in that situation I tend to look at players through rose-tinted eyes.  Tonight however there was no mistaking that he had a very poor half.

It's no biggy, every player has them.

6431~~~
Yes, and I do agree with you actually that after a few weeks rest this summer, Martial will be ready to go on next season again and play most games for us. He's at that age now that it shouldn't be a problem.

6432~~~
They haven't been any better with him off.

6433~~~
You've just deleted 75% of my post, including the sentence where I said he had a poor half, then proceeded to argue that he had a poor half. 

I never said he played well. I said he wasn't the worst player on the pitch. Because he wasn't.

6434~~~
All this bickering about a 20 year old player who had a poor half in a team full of more experienced underperformers?

6435~~~
I deleted the part that had nothing to do with my opinion, comments like "at least he was trying stuff" mean nothing when you feck it up every time. So I simply focused on the fact that our opinions differ, I think he was absolutely awful, the worst player on the park for sure.  Looked a complete bag nerves.

You disagree, that's fine.

Either way, it's no biggy, Ronaldo was dogshit for 90 minutes last night. Players sometimes have bad nights.

6436~~~
Martial is such a touchy subject on here.

6437~~~
You deleted me saying he had a poor half and then went on arguing that he had a poor half!

6438~~~
The entire team has underperformed tonight. It took a brilliant cross and a 25 year old who's most like going to cost a club £60m plus this summer to get the win. Most predicted France would walk this 3-0.

Edit: And Payet...

6439~~~
Strange discussion this.

You think he was poor, I think he was poor. Let's leave it at that.

6440~~~
After Deschamp cruelly humiliated Martial all I wanted was for Albania to win that game, alas the Gods do not favour me tonight.

He was poor but Albania were always going to tire in the second half and the game would open up. He could have given him another 15 minutes.

6441~~~
I'm not saying he isn't a good player, I'm just saying perhaps not as good as we made him to be. There's a difference.

6442~~~
How is hooking a 20 year old after a poor half bad management? At that age, on that kind of stage, in front of his own fans, after a few bad touches, among a whole host of under-performing players, how could it do anything other than damage his confidence? And would you honestly say he was any worse than, say, Giroud? It just seems incredible heavy-handed to me.

6443~~~
It's not <i>humiliating</i> to be brought off after a half in which nothing worked for him.  He started him ahead of Pogba and Griezmann in a show of confidence.

Why is everyone so precious?

6444~~~
Confident? Where do you get confidence from in my posts regarding his performance tonight? Look at my choice of words.

And 20 minutes is more than enough to show something. People pretend as if 20 minutes of playing time is nothing. It was 5 minutes, maybe even 10 I could understand it. But not when he receives 20 minutes.

6445~~~
His manager just dropped 100 or whatever million player to play him. I am not sure it's just the United fans.

6446~~~
So we just keep underperforming players on the pitch now to be nice to them because they are young? What on Earth?

6447~~~
Aye. France didn't have a genuine ball player in the middle of the park in the first half. The team was disjointed.

As for Martial now being crap after one bad half in the Euros, Kevin De Brunye was pony for Belgium the other night so we can add him to the scrap heap too.

6448~~~
After one poor half for his national team, at 20 years of age?

6449~~~
So you're basing your opinion on comments here?


One poor half and all hell brakes loose.

6450~~~
And based on things written in live tickers. Granted it's not a great source, but if it's the universal opinion that he was piss poor, there has to be some truth to it. I mean why does he, in a France team that was apparently shite overall in the first half, get taken off?

6451~~~
Half time subs are usually for players in danger of costing you the game. Martial should have been given another 15 IMO. It is what Fergie would have done anyway, he was always reluctant to hook a player at half time because it doesn't help a players confidence at all.

6452~~~
That's just silly, he's been superb in 90% of games for United, against top sides.

He had a poor 45 minutes, but he's been superb for France whenever called upon this past year and his manager thinks so highly of him he started him ahead of two superstars tonight.

Reactions during this tournament are bizarre, players sometime have poor games, big fecking deal.

6453~~~
Pogba is hardly a 100 million player. Just because that's Juve's demand and teams are willing to pay it doesn't mean it's his actual worth. Besides, Deschamps isn't too fond of Pogba anyways.

6454~~~
Maybe you should watch the game and not base your opinion on things written in live tickers. 
He wasn't the worst player for France. Deschamp subbed him off yeah but lets not make a big deal out of it like those guys in live tickers.

6455~~~
Completely disagree, and Fergie managed a league side, it's very different in a competition like this.

And get used to it, cause Mourinho loves a HT sub, as do I.  Martial is a big boy who plays for Manchester United, he should perform or risk being hooked, just as Pogba and Griezmann were the other night and then dropped.

6456~~~
Because they switched back to 433, the formation they are most used to. That meant Payet moved to the left and Martial sacrificed. Payet is on fire at the moment so no arguments there.

6457~~~
He will go for 100 million so that will make him one.

6458~~~
How is it different in a international competition? Albania were naturally going to tire after the effort they put in the first half, France were not under any pressure at the back. The game would open up anyway. Deschamp bottled it and got lucky in the end.

6459~~~
Yup, he said that if you were confident enough to start someone you should be confident enough to leave them on a bit longer after the half. The space that was there for France towards the end is where Martial would thrive.

Ah well, he should come back to Manchester reasonably well rested <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6460~~~
He is shite, we should sell.

6461~~~
That doesn't mean the likes of Coman or even Giroud couldn't have been taken off. But I see your point, Deschamps' options of taking a player off were limited, hence his substitution hardly means he was the worst player on the pitch. And to be fair, they did perform better in the 2nd half in their old formation.

6462~~~
Because SAF was looking after a long term team and long term interests.  Not the same for national managers in a tournament, that much is obvious no?

Someone needed to get hooked and show the first half wasn't good enough.  I personally agreed that it should have been Martial but could easily have been another player or 2.

6463~~~
The whole French team had a shite first half tbh, i'm not sure why anyone would single out Martial based on that.

6464~~~
Him for Veratti!

6465~~~
Having read the comments, here is my analysis:

- Martial was brought on very late (78 min) in the last game while he should have been brought on before Coman considering the season he had + his performances with the French national team.
- Then, He was given a shock start in this game. 

Anyone who has ever watched him play knows that he was trying extremely hard - because this is what happens when you're trusted to start after playing just 12 minutes in the previous game. He knew this was his chance. Albanians were defending very well in the first half and none of the French players had a good half. Payet was woeful in the first half.

So DD immediately subs Martial off which confirms Martial's fear that this was the only chance. 

IMO, it's poor management from the coach and that's it for Martial in this tournament.

6466~~~
More likely Martial will be called upon again with 20 minutes to go in a game soon and he's more than capable of stepping up when asked.

6467~~~
It's not about being nice, it's about individual player management, which is fairly delicate with most youngsters. How often do players get subbed at half-time? It's basically the football equivalent of saying, "You're shit". If you give him an extra 15 minutes, he has the chance to improve and the manager still has plenty of time to change it. 

Deschamps was so desperate to show Pogba and Griezmann that they hadn't done enough that he sent out the wrong side and ended up sacrificing another player to prove his point.

6468~~~
This entire post is precious.

Martial is a 20 year old man, not an 11 year old child, any decent player uses this to be more determined to do better next time.

I also thinking bringing someone off at HT is the football equivalent of saying, "You've had a tough half, it just hasn't worked for you, or us and we need to change something". Which is no doubt what the manager said to him,

"You're shit" would be leaving him at home or leaving him on the bench the entire tournament even when they are 1-0 down and desperate for a player like him.

Have any of you lot ever been in a football dressing room?  Would you all have cried aged 20 when subbed?

6469~~~
Wonder the reaction if Sterling had this performance and was subbed off HT.

The likes of Pogba & Griezmann were poor players before today and Embolo is suddenly the 'new Heskey.' 

Point being, the knee-jerk is getting ridiculous.

6470~~~
Christ on a fecking bike, can't believe there are people saying he's overrated just because he had a poor half.

6471~~~
He should have been brought off at HT, maybe England would have been further away in the second half.

But lovely Roy didn't want to upset by and tell him "you're shit".

6472~~~
Kane should have been taken off for Vardy if anything. I don't see any better England player to play Sterling's position.

6473~~~
Logic and reason won't make you very far here

6474~~~
You're only as good as your last game on the caf

6475~~~
The difference is Martial has an excellent first season overall whereas Sterling's game looks to have stagnated. Not sure why they need to be compared.

6476~~~
Not that surprising to be honest, many fans have the memory of a goldfish.

6477~~~
This place is mental mate.  Martial gets a start already by the second group game after a nice cameo in game one, that's his manager showing how much trust he has in him.  And now because he brought him off after a poor half, "he's done, that's him finished for the tournament" and the manager has just basically told him "you're shit".

It's a crazy place.

6478~~~
Going by how it seems more and more people are judging players after one game.. sell him, he's shit.

6479~~~
Well we already have Ronaldo, Kane, Lewandowski, Pogba & Zlatan in the group so it's good company to keep.

6480~~~
You can put De Brunye and Hazard in there. Lukaku was absolutely appalling as was Origi when he came on.

6481~~~
I don't think he was substituted because he was super bad, the fact that Pogba came on for him and not Griezmann tells me that Deschamps was mainly going for a tactical change here and one that imo payed off. France seemed to be better in control of the game after switching back to a midfield trio of Kanté, Matuidi and Pogba.

6482~~~
Man this place is so mental it's just unbelievable!

Reading some of these comments one would think they're talking about an absolute donkey not the player who alomst singlehandedly carried the responsibility week in week out of an otherwise toothless and clueless attack!

One good game or a Youtbe clip is more than enough to label the player as the best thing since slice bread but one bad game or sometimes even a bad half he's garbage - Caf in a nutshell!

6483~~~
Well I'm glad that I've had an insight into the entirely logical world of the half-time substitution. It's scarcity would suggest you don't quite have the hotline into football's inner sanctum that you've alluded to but you've made your points and we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.

6484~~~
He was spectacularly bad. Threw the ball away literally every time he got it. 

Don't understand why we can't admit it. He's an amazingly talented player who we're lucky to have. And today he was atrocious and by far the worst player on the pitch. Glad he got that game out of the way at the Euros rather than in the red shirt.

6485~~~
It's not that scarce at all mate, and as I mentioned earlier, Mourinho is a big fan of it so get used to it.

If a player has a very poor first half and you've got players like Pogba or Griezmann on the bench, of course you make the substitution.

6486~~~
Looked like Nani on his worst day today. Hopefully it was just a blip....

6487~~~
Hard to complain about him getting subbed (he was very poor), but I do feel he was slightly hard done by. Surely those two sentiments aren't mutually exclusive?

6488~~~
Off the top of my head by the way this season <a class="username" data-user="90945, @Eckers99" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90945/">@Eckers99</a>

Valencia v Wolfburg.
Mata v Everton.
Darmian v Southampton
Darmian v Arsenal? <i>Not certain of that one but surely he was.</i>
John Terry quite famously this season by Mourinho, can't remember the opposition.
Ramires subbed for Matic (who then did get humiliated with being sub subbed <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/> )

Benteke v Norwich City is another I remember.

It happens alot when players have a poor first half.  As I say, with Mourinho especially, he loves it and Özil often ended up on the end of it: 

"<i>Similarly, if we talk about league games, the German player has been subbed off 9 times (3 of them at half-time) of the 13 games he has played in</i>."

Oh yeah... and Di Maria v Sunderland too last season is one that sticks out.

6489~~~
Or for tactical adjustments, which was the case here.

6490~~~
feck sake. I didn't watch the match but it's not good hearing Tony played shit.

6491~~~
Most often tactical adjustments as they are easier to make at half time.

6492~~~
So you can think of 4 occasions out of, what, 60 games that someone was subbed at half time in United games last season - 1 in every 15 games - and you wouldn't describe that as scarce? And 2 of them were Darmian having genuine, white-knuckle, cover your eyes, shockers.

Anyway, we're disappearing down a rabbit hole with this one - I thought Martial was one of many poor performers in a disjointed looking France side (partly because of Deschamps original line up, partly because he was one of many who didn't do enough), you think he deserved to go and was man enough to take it.

Not having it, but fair enough!

6493~~~
Poor performance, could have easily been given another 15 minutes second half but in a team with an attack as strong as France there's no reason to leave him on. He's a top class player and already close to world class in my opinion but all players have bad days at the office and he's more than good enough to bounce back with a goal next game and get right back in the team. That's the beauty of football...you just never know... 

The knee jerk reactions at times on here tho can actually go to hell.

6494~~~
Off the top of my head to be fair, reckon there's a tonne more throughout the league.

As mentioned by another poster above, subbing at half time makes tactical changes (like tonight), much easier.  Happens loads, weirdly enough I don't remember every sub we make <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6495~~~
Must try harder <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

6496~~~
Reckon I named 4 more than you could, so RAB 4 - 0 <a class="username" data-user="90945, @Eckers99" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90945/">@Eckers99</a> <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

6497~~~
He was woeful. But he is fecking 20. 
I think people expect unrealistic amount of consistency because he's our best player. 
At his age, a lot of Man Utd fans wanted Ronaldo sold for example. 
You guys need to relax. He had a bad game and he will have many more.

6498~~~
I know every half-time substitution since William Prunier V Spurs in 1996 but refuse to name any of them as they'd undermine the point I'm trying to make!

6499~~~
I wonder whether Martial is a little jaded physically after last season.  LVG played him into the ground - 4663 minutes is an insane number for a 19/20 year old player.  For comparison, Coman played 2476.

I don't think it would be the worst thing in the world for United fans if he didn't play much the remainder of the tournament.

6500~~~
It wouldn't. I mentioned it before, but I saw somewhere that no footballer played more matches than Martial the past season.

6501~~~
No need to go too hard on him. Griezmann and Pogba were just as bad, if not worse, in the first game and they are two of the most sought after players in the world. He's only 20 and even the best have off days.

6502~~~
Doubt it is true. Suarez or Neymar im sure have played more minutes. Those guys barely got rotated at Barcelona this year and Barcelona as a team played more games than us.

6503~~~
Might have included international matches as well.

6504~~~
I get where your coming from he did have a bad game but like I said I thought the whole team was terrible in the first half, also I agree it's better that it's in a blue shirt rather than a red one.

6505~~~
Expected reaction from Caf after such performance. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Anyways, I think this experience should do him good for long term. Last season, He became our main attacking outlet right away and often had to carry the team. He did well, but our state is bad and that's not good for a young attacker's responsibility to have to shoulder the responsibility of the team in his first season. We basically made him to swim and that has some bad influence on his development. He still have so much to learn which IMO, we failed to assist him. Today game shows that when he is to take a lesser role to Payet, and to be a provider for a static forward in Giroud, he struggled. He has less freedom to move inside, both by Albania tight defense and the different tactic and movement by France team (Giroud just camps in the box, while as bad as Rooney was Rooney did move out to create space and link up).

Martial's crossing and passing is not up there to help him out. His off ball movement is still dull at time. Sided with Evra who rarely put in a good cross & liable at time caught up high up field also didn't help. As bad as Rojo, Rojo keeps width well, put useless/inaccurate cross (good technique to make stretching cross/ stretch the defense line a bit) that helped freeing up some room for Martial...

With that in mind, this helps keeping him grounded to further development. He had a very good season, but still a long way to be a top player. He should realize the needs of adding more dimension  to his game, so he is not cornered the same way, in case the team needs to adjust tactic/ approach and can't afford him his preferred style.

6506~~~
Martial had a season where he was the only one capable of making something happen. He was a 19/20 year old in his first season in the league and at our club. Yet, he was the one responsible for running at people and creating chances. He did that for United, tried things every time he had the ball. This should never be the case. No player should have this kind of responsibility(assumed by himself or given by the manager).
I really hope this changes this season. I want a threat on our right and through the middle too. This is very important for Martial's balanced growth as a player.
Last night Martial, assumed a similar responsibility. Did not work very well for him, too big an occasion to try things out every single time. He had a bad half, and I was not surprised to see him taken off, but in the first 25 minutes of the second half, France were missing that player who could do what Martial was trying.
I am not too disheartened by Martial's game last night. I just hope he is the first attacking substitution France make in the remaining matches of this tournament. He deserves it.

6507~~~
He didn't have a good night but some overreactions from the caf.  Still looks very much the unpolished gem that you'd expect at this age

6508~~~
Wanna swap?

6509~~~
I would like to see him gain even more confidence from this experience at the Euros, but as long as he's in form for us at the start of the season, I'm not that bothered. He's only 20. His international career is in its infancy right now. It's the next 4 tournaments that are his big ones.

6510~~~
With whom?  Sandro or Munir?  

Time, takes time.  The thing I liked with him is that he kept at it even after failing a few times - never seemed entirely defeated.  Albania did a nice job denying him space that he's used to in the Premiership and he looked to use his strength & speed to try and get past.  His dribbling and decisionmaking will improve, hopefully Mou won't break him though

6511~~~
My previous post agreed with your first 2 paragraphs. However, I disagree on your assessment (3rd paragraph).

 France created an early scoring chance in the second half from a cross on their left wing. Then few more followed up chances from left wing within first 25 minutes IIRC. Martial was out of sync with the team rhythm in the first half. He seems to play his own game, and trying too hard on his own with no end product. Martial was supposed to play second fiddle to Payet in creativity yesterday, and second fiddle/feeder to Giroud (who is static and solely camped in center). This is different from Martial role for United, where Martial is the main outlet. Our #10, even Rooney as #9 and Rashford were supposed to make movement to create space for Martial. Martial was not afforded the same privilege last night and his weakness in crossing, passing showed.

Agree with your conclusion, too.

6512~~~
He has a great mentality. In fact, this was the first time I thought he might be feeling a bit of tension. All season, he's dealt with the pressure of his price tag and responsibility of being our main attacker, at the age of 20, wonderfully. Usually, he seems like one of those "in the zone" players, who are unfazed by little. I like players of that mould. Who just go on and do their talking on the pitch and dont get involved in confrontations or drama.

My only worry with him, at this stage in his career, is him being overly harsh on himself. I remember he posted about his performance being disappointing once during the season, so I hope he doesn't let this affect him throughout the tournament. I could see him being very disappointed in himself for blowing what he would see as a big chance. Luckily, that didn't happen with us and he just got on with proving himself further.

6513~~~
He's played a silly amount of games for someone so young adjusting to a physically demanding league. I'd rather he didn't start another game and get a nice rest before the start of the season.

6514~~~
Definitely seems mature for his age - His teammates encouraging him after some bad decisions also lends some support to the theory that he's too hard on himself. 

Not sure why so many have unrealistic expectations, he's a developing player not the finished article

6515~~~
Yeah, I think you are talking about the chance that Pogba volleyed over, correct? While watching the match I was able to convince my self that it was not related to the Martial substitution, I am not sure what the logic was, can't recall. Could be due to my Red-tinted Martial loving glasses. :-p.
Cheers.

6516~~~
He is wank. Please do not start him again in this tournament. I think they should remove him from the squad and send him on an early vacation.

6517~~~
Nah, that's it. Career is over mate.

6518~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6519~~~
Should come off the bench from now on.

6520~~~
I am still new here so I am not sure what constitutes the caf population.However, something seems wrong of late. Are all these negative reviews from united supporters or are some of them from liverpool and city supporters who have waited all season for a chance to attack this brilliant player.

Really? After one bad game? Some of you are just on a wind up. He had one bad half. United supportes should really know not to read too much from one or two games by now.

For non united supporters  taking the piss at Martial, lets be fair then, if we are to judge players on how many bad international games they have had then Ronaldo should pack up and take up modelling for good, Kane should also drop football and advertise horse related products and sterling should probably try do  a kim kardashian, where he is paid a lot to sit on his big butt and do nothing(or maybe he is already doing that) Emre can,Coutinho and Firminho should all drop football and take up porn.

6521~~~
Bloody hell, the kid has a relatively poor 45 minutes in a team that isn't clicking particularly well and suddenly for many it's a crisis....

He's so young, he'll have plenty of bad games for United as well, which is why Jose will bring someone in to ease the pressure and relax his development.

6522~~~
Martial had a bad game but the whole French performance was pretty poor, the only player who looked useful from start to finish was, once again, Payet. It was such a dull game to watch.

Pogba came on for Martial and did nothing but strut around in the second half. Griezmann came on and just seemed to walk about until he scored. Neither dramatically changed the level of the French performance.

Overall, I think it's harsh to lambast Martial, and Deschamps should have perhaps given him another 15/20 mins to try and redeem himself before hooking him. France really need to pull themselves together, they can't rely on Payet to win the whole competition for them.

6523~~~
Yup. Clearly on the way down it seems.

6524~~~
We'd be lucky to get 5 million for him after that performance.

6525~~~
Top talent but really needs work on his short passing.

6526~~~
Except the nature of the tournament might prevent that from happening. They have one more group game, which they need to win if they want to top their group and avoid a tough opponent in the first elimination round. So Deschmaps will first and foremost stick with those who brought him victories, meaning Griezmann and Pogba. That'll be even more so in the elimination rounds because it's do-or-die and given the pressure on the French NT to win the tournament, he'd be foolish to not throw what he deems to be the best lineup out there.

When it comes to substitutions, Coman has proven himself to be better so far in this tournament and will rightfully be trusted more in pressure situations. Gignac seems to be the preferred choice to replace Giroud up front as he is more similar to him than a guy like Martial. Given that Payet has played a good tournament so far and Griezmann has had a good performance against Albania, it's only normal to believe Martial will have a tough time getting on the pitch for more than 5 to 10 minutes.

Of course one could counter that Deschamps knows about Martial's qualities and abilities, but when he has to win a tournament, who is he gonna trust first and foremost?

As for the halftime substitution, I generally don't deem it a problem when it's at the club level because there are simply so many games to be played where you can prove yourself. But in this kind of tournament, you could've given the kid a few more minutes in the second half to see if he can't turn it around. I think Deschamps panicked and wanted to return to his proven system, so given that Martial was apparently worse than Coman and Payet in the first half, he was the one to be taken off.

6527~~~
I didnt watch the game but I did notice that he looked fatigued in the FA cup final. I guess he played too many games. 

Plus that Hysaj fella looks more than decent. Left footed right back. Pretty rare I think. There were rumours that Bayern has been looking at him as well.

6528~~~
I always wonder one thing, when discussing two players who have a bad game. Whats worse;

<ol>
<li>Not being involved much in the game, therefore you have limited opportunities to mess up</li>
<li>Being involved a lot, trying different things and those things not working out.</li>
</ol>Because Coman fitted in to 1 and Martial was number 2. For me personally, id rather have 2, because if you are good something will eventually work. So if im judging a players game, those who are in the number 1 category are the 'worse' ones.

6529~~~
I agree with this.  I prefer Martial making himself available to receive the ball as opposed to Giroud being anonymous apart from a few missed headers.

I think the problem with the French team in the first half was that they were not set up right and Payet, in particular, was out of position.  This was fixed to an extent at half time although even then, the French overall did not play well.

I hope that Deschamps has the decency to talk to Martial about this and not let him stew on it as he needs him confident for the rest of the tournament.

6530~~~
Must be one or the other. There's nothing inbetween.

6531~~~
HT subs <a class="username" data-user="90945, @Eckers99" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/90945/">@Eckers99</a> ;-)

Not that rare, and well worth doing.

And not at all fecking humiliating, gives bench players the full 45 they need, worked twice now in 18 hours.

6532~~~
He is not doing well, but the way France play, it benefits Payet and Giroud, but their other attacking players like Pogba, Griezmann even though he did score, Coman do not feel good as well.
Fo example Certainly Pogba has not been the 100m player he is for Juve. So maybe some of the blame for his stale performance is down to tactics, set-up of the team.

6533~~~

6534~~~
To me the Marseille pitch completely ruined his game. We know he's about quick acceleration bursts and quick turns. The fact the pitch kept cutting up so badly it practically meant he couldn't push away with all his speed. He slipped so many times trying to run it was ridiculous.

6535~~~
To be fair, I thought this too.  Pitch was absolutely horrific and all the players seemed to struggle on it.

6536~~~
not worth 5 mil , stick him in under 21s then loan him out and let him go for free, doing us a favour....

<span style="color: #ffffff">lol</span>

Should swap this aging fraud for young William from Massy.

6540~~~
Deschamps really isn't a very good manager.

6541~~~
The French better hope he gets himself together and Deschamps gives him a chance. Can't see them winning the tournament with only Pogba, Payet and an out of form Griezmann providing any threat.

6542~~~
Honestly, part of me hopes he doesn't play for the rest of the tournament. He's played far too much football this past season. A good rest to recharge the batteries would be good for him.

But then the other part of me thinks he's absolutely box office to watch at his best and France have been quite boring this tournament so maybe him playing would add a bit of spice.

And then these voices, they keep arguing in my head, telling me things: Martial plays, no he doesn't, but he's entertaining, but he needs a rest... Make it stop! Someone please, make it stop! They won't stop fighting!

6543~~~
The lad's got terrible taste in women.

6544~~~
With him still training, warming up etc. it's hardly a true break. If he's there, he should play. Otherwise it's just a waste of time for him because neither his body nor his mind can recover. As I've predicted though, Deschamps doesn't seem to trust him that much, so I doubt we'll see more of him other than a short cameo. Instead France uses the likes of Gignac and Giroud up front.

6545~~~
He needs a rest . I dont think France can win the euro with just Payet/Pogba. They will need Martial/Coman in wings making things happen.

6546~~~
Deshamps happy man, Martial's 45 mins against Albania (where most played like shit) gives a valid excuse to avoid starting Martial that plenty of people wanted to happen, I don't think Martial's gonna feature anymore.

6547~~~
Deschamps doesn't play the excuse game, Martial joined the french team with an injury and has been protected since then. And the simple fact that he started against Albania shows that Deschamps rates him.

6548~~~
You know better obviously, however all of your attacking players (Payet aside) have played poorly yet keep their places. Imagine Martial playing fabulously against Albania, the pressure would be to drop on of the bigger names which wouldn't have to work too well with the French I assume. Honestly, Martial is partly at blame because of his shocking 45 mins, just unlucky everything panned this way with Griezmann scoring at the last minute and Giroud's 'I don't even know where that header is going' goal.

EDIT: If Martial's still a bit injured/lacks match rhythm then fair enough.

6549~~~
Are you sure though? Deschamps was visibly infuriated with Martial - that's odd considering more than half the french players were awful.
He gave Martial hardly 10-12 minutes in the first game. He could have given Martial another go for half an hour in the 3rd game considering France were already through but chose not to.

I don't think he's going to gamble and play Martial in the knockout games now?

6550~~~
What is the question?

Edit: Deschamps is extremely pragmatic, he will never play a player that he doesn't rate in the second game of the group stage and we all knew that he would play a weakened team against Switzerland if we were qualified. That's what he did at the World Cup.

6551~~~
Martial will be a bench option for France, but could still have an impact. I mean Gignac hasn't exactly pulled up trees. Giroud will likely start, but could easily see Martial getting minutes from the bench.

6552~~~
Its his first tournament, There is no rush. He will be main man at the world cup in 2 years time if it all goes well.

6553~~~

6554~~~

6555~~~
Ruined his own chance with his displays, it's unfortunate.

6556~~~
He had 13 minutes at the end of the first game then played poorly in the second game in which he was hooked off at half time. Since then he's not been given a look in.

6557~~~
He's knackered, bar a few matches he looked jaded towards the end of last season. The less matches he plays in this tournament the better for us.

6558~~~
Yes he didn't look as energetic. Pretty lethargic last few games for him really, but I have no doubt he will play his part in this tournament. As super sub most likely against well martial defensive units and when the team needs some driving penetrations. Unlike Spain vs Italy where they really had no other ideas besides playing the short possession game.

6559~~~
I'm actually starting to agree more with this although I want him playing. It's better for him if he records more goals and assists for france. I would have liked for him to be Frances top goalscorer but oh well. 

At least he is training and getting ready for the new season even before he goes on vacation.

6560~~~
Van Gaal played him in a lot of games for a lot of minutes and relied heavily on him for getting us out of trouble. Very often Martial was the one who gave us a spark to make something happen. He's massively overachieved in his first season above reasonable expectations for his age. Under the guidance and better man management of Mourinho, I think he's got a bright future for us.

6561~~~
Yeah it would've been great if he lit up the tournament but there's still time I suppose. 
Will he miss the pre season tour? I bet he probably will so he'll most likely have an iffy start to the season.

6562~~~
Few bold statements in there.

6563~~~
Martial will surely be our new #7 now that Zlatan takes the #9?

Memphis can feck off and get 77 or something.

6564~~~
More likely will be the 11, can't see Memphis being happy losing the 7 so early, Januzaj doesn't really deserve the 11 either.

6565~~~
#14 and #19 are open so I don't think anyone else would need to change. I'm sure he wouldn't mind wearing the #14 like Henry. 

Not that i'm completely convinced by that picture mind.

6566~~~
Memphis doesn't deserve the 7 and never did 

Bastian took away 31 from Fellaini last season so this things happen.

6567~~~
AM14 does seem quite fitting although I'm not sure it's a good idea with the connotations it carries.

Unless Memphis is leaving the club, I'm not sure it's a good idea to take the 7 off him. At the end of the day we've invested 20 odd million in him and having a difficult first season doesn't really warrant stripping him of a number he was obviously very proud to be given.

6568~~~
Feck number 14.

6569~~~
If it were up to me I wouldn't take anyones number from them for a player who will be gone in 2 years, at the most.

When Zlatan arrived at PSG he took #18. And that was with the #7, 9, 10 and 11 belonging to the likes of Menez, Hoarau, Nene and Lavezzi. I don't think it's impossible that he'd accept #19 himself. Maybe our marketing department has other plans though, I don't know.

6570~~~
I actually like Martial with the 7 and think he should keep it. AM9 is already becoming a brand image for him and can increase further in value if he does even better next season. Zlatan should take another number.

6571~~~
I'm sure Fellaini didn't give a shit about the #31 shirt, but Memphis uses his #7 as part of his image: M7. When he's posting up his desparate work out videos on Instagram to try and prove that he's infact not lazy, he finishes them with the M7 logo.

Besides all that, it'd effectively feel like a demotion for a player like Memphis going from #7 to #15 or something. #7 is a meaningful number here, and considering how he clearly wants to be like Ronaldo it's even more so for him.

6572~~~
We can always dress it up as him wanting to move to another number like Valencia did.

I was steadfast against Memphis getting the number last season(was in the minority then, and felt that he had to earn it first). It has been a disaster, and from a marketing point of perspective for United, we could give the 7 to a much better and more marketable player. 

Maybe it would spur him on to prove a point or something.

6573~~~
It seems a bit much making him change numbers for Ibra, unless he prefers to take 11.

6574~~~
We should go back to the days when the starting eleven wore numbers 1-11, none of this squad number nonsense.

6575~~~
Why?

6576~~~
If Ibra is here for one year, what's the point in giving him number 9?

Unless there's some sort of plan to give it to Marcus, providing he maintains his form, after Ibra has gone.

6577~~~
I remember reading in his book talking about numbers. In one chapter he didn't give a feck it was just a number. 

But he was landed when given Ronaldo's number at clubs Ronaldo played for.

6578~~~
All the discussion based on random tweet.

6579~~~
Serious question: Is there anything wrong, in United's history, with the #14? Or is it purely a superstitious/tradition thing?

Maybe Martial will take #10 off Rooney as a sign of Rooney accepting a 'lesser' role in the club?

Martial 24 will look good though <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

6580~~~
Because they were simpler times, men were men, women were women, the milkman delivered on time and there was none of this global warming. Ah yes.

6581~~~
Ibra should not get the number 9. How can we jus strip it from martial? Unless martial is okay with taking number 7 from depay then I'm game.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

6582~~~
Maybe we want to give him the #11 shirt. Januzaj is doing feck all with it anyway.

6583~~~
Seeing some more Martial madness was pretty much the only thing I was looking forward to this tournament, Deschamps just had to ruin it the water-carrying prick.

6584~~~
Scored s scissor kick in training, so there's that...

6585~~~
As I said early on in the tournament, it's a giant waste of time for him. Actual rest could've been much better for him.

6586~~~
I hope France get destroyed by the Germans. Unless Martial plays.

6587~~~
Are least he didn't get injured I suppose.

6588~~~
Wasn't he quite good in any friendlies or qualifying matches before the tournament? Strange how one bad half has seemingly ruined every chance at this Euro.

6589~~~
As I said early on in the tournament, it's a giant waste of time for him. Actual rest could've been much better for him.
True, but he still has to train and travel and can't really take a break while not exactly receiving a confidence boost.

6590~~~
Gignac ahead of him. Who has looked a complete donkey.

6591~~~
Our player who has been overused this season is getting a rest at the first senior-football tournament, his team is doing fine, there's no risk of him getting injured, why are you guys losing your shit is beyond me.

I can only fecking imagine how much you'd be crying if he actually played for France and got injured for couple of months. Then DD would be a dick for playing him.

6592~~~
Called it a while back. Deschamps doesn't rate Martial at all and hopefully this mistreatment doesn't damage his confidence.

6593~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Aye, Moussa Sissoko & Gignac gets game time ahead of him. FFS.

He had a poor half - but feck me, the entire French attack struggled in those first 2 matches.

6594~~~
What <a class="username" data-user="64979, @Kostur" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64979/">@Kostur</a> said.

6595~~~
They have a stacked squad, so it's obviously hard to break in there especially as he doesn't quite fit in. He's playing in a squad which was one of the favourites from the start of the tournaments, not some losers who couldn't make the top 4 in league. Different level of competition.

6596~~~
Feel sorry for him but he didn't exactly do himself justice in the game he started.

6597~~~
I suppose that's one way of looking at it. Generally though, if I don't have a team I follow at a tournament (or they're knocked out), I generally mainly watch to see the united lads doing well.

6598~~~
For me, two ways would be fine: you either don't nominate him at all and let him get actual rest or you give him playing time. Now he isn't truly rested while also not receiving a confidence boost.

6599~~~
I agree, dont care tbh. Just stay fit and focus on United. His time will come

6600~~~
Correct. Deschamps is and always was a dick.

6601~~~
Not really though, you do gain experience from the sole fact of being at the tourno, sub, mostly bench or not really. 

Yea I do get this point of view but really, given how much he's been used by us I'm glad he's actually not playing.

6602~~~
1. We want to see Utd players in Euro.
2. If he was being rested, then of course it's fine but he's been shunned because of one bad 45 minutes. Extremely unfairly. That damages the confidence of a young player and could hamper his performances next season (small chance but a possibility yes)

6603~~~
1) I don't really care if it's not my NT.
2) There's nothing unfair at Euros or WC, you either perform or you're benched, especially if the squad is as tight as it is with the French who probably have the strongest squad of all teams. Or actually that's how it should work, not like with English NT.

6604~~~
Yeah can't be great for confidence. I think hes been pretty underrated by Deschamps so far.

6605~~~
It'll motivate him next season.

6606~~~
Seems his selection has suffered from his last performance. Which is very unfortunate. The "would you trade Martial for Messi" Thread must have jinxed his performance.

6607~~~
His direct competition has been Gignac, who in every single of his substitute appearances has been ghastly. I'm not expecting him to start or anything, but his omission for the aforementioned is nutty.

6608~~~
He may still get a chance in the Euros, it's not the end of the world that he didn't play tonight. He's still only 20 years old and the French squad is very good, I don't think it'll knock his confidence if he doesn't get to play a lot. He has plenty of tournaments in his future

6609~~~
After a long season limited game time in the Euros does no harm from a United point of view, so works for me

6610~~~
1. Suit yourself.
2. Yes it is unfair. He was played 12 minutes in the first game after a stellar season. Then he was started all of a sudden. He had a bad 45 minutes but so did everyone else. France have had horrendous performers until this game and yet they start/get minutes every game. Martial has been completely sidelined .. (dare i use the word: unfairly again?) and that can damage his confidence for next season.

6611~~~
Don't think he's ever played as a striker for France. He just doesn't fit their blueprint for a CF, so that's why he won't get games there. Especially with Greizmann on the pitch, who already does the type of job Martial would do upfront.

6612~~~
But in the end it's France's problem and DD's problem, not ours really. I can't see him not being picked at the Euros affecting how he does for a club where he was a started and a main star last season, sorry.

6613~~~
Griezmann and Martial are very different players, I feel.

6614~~~
Not injured and we're only a month away from the new season, that's all I care!

6615~~~
As forwards they both stretch the pitch. Greizmann's their best player and likes to play off a target man, I don't see how Martial can provide that.

6616~~~
Forget Martial but I do think Deschamps was being idiotic tonight. 4-0 at half-time one would think you rest Griezmann and/or Payet immediately, let alone at 60th minute mark.

6617~~~
Ridiculous amount of games for him this season compared to last, its absolutely good news. Proper rest is good too, but just training is a completely different level of intensity and if they win the tournament he's still going to be in the feel good bubble when the season kicks in.

6618~~~
Oh woe, such injustice against Martial to be the only one kept on the bench. So how did Cabaye, Digne, Jallet and Schneiderlin do during the game?

6619~~~
Yeah, fair enough! From a United perspective, a rest will do him good. He was carrying our attack throughout last season.

I still think it's a bit daft by DD. You want to give your game changers, who are out of form, some minutes to build up their form/confidence. And when/if France needs a goal in later rounds, Sissoko and Gignac are not their best hope for that source of inspiration, IMO, of course.

6620~~~
You're probably right in that sense that the game was already dead at HT so he could've just thrown both Coman and Martial at them but still, I can't complain due to his rest.

6621~~~
No, Giroud and Koscielny have yellows, that's why they are the first out, after that Coman covers both wings which makes him a lot more valuable than Martial, he is the one that needs to be in form.

6622~~~
Yeah! Let's hope he comes back for pre season well rested and prepared. Expecting big things from him this year!

6623~~~
Do we? I don't give a feck tbh.

6624~~~
I don't say he should have put Martial in as that would simply be a nice gesture which I don't expect from Deshamps. Footballing-wise, Coman seems more in-form so it's logical he plays but if he's really that worried about Giroud or Koscielny getting yellows - why hasn't he sub Giroud and/or Koscielny earlier?

6625~~~
Sorry but, if that's enough to damage his confidence for any longer than a few days, let alone the rest of the season then he doesn't have the right mentality to cut it at the highest level.

That being said, I don't think this will affect him anywhere near as negatively as some are making out.

6626~~~
I don't know why he didn't subbed them earlier but that's why he did it.

6627~~~
I don't get the outcry. There are better players in his position and they have performed better so far in the tournament.

I understand we all want to see him play but Deschamps has a duty to play his best team and Martial is not in that. Simple really.

6628~~~
It's as if people just criticize for the sake of it without even looking at the game, the needs of the moment and everything.
The comments I'm reading, I don't know if they're written in jokes or if posters are serious. Some people definitely a reality check that everything doesn't revolve around Manchester United players.

6629~~~
They are convinced that Deschamps is shite and hates Martial, when I'm pretty sure that Deschamps tried Martial and Payet on both wings before taking his decision because that's how he is. Deschamps is probably the most impartial coach out there, he was strongly against purchasing Gignac at Marseille and now he selects him even though he plays in Mexico.

6630~~~
Whatever happens against Germany, I consider Deschamps as a very good coach. Lots of sensible decisions and readjustments he's made. It is nice to see a coach who has clear ideas and doesn't hesitate to change things when he doesn't like them, a big big change from LVG for instance.

6631~~~
Why on earth do they keep subbing on that lumbering donkey Gignac ?

6632~~~
Who gives a feck? Let him rest and come back fully fit. He had hamstring problems towards the end of he season and was injured during e warm up matches. 
IMO,it's good news for us.

6633~~~
He's their only other striker after Giroud  

Martial is played as a winger, just like he does for United

6634~~~
It's about opinions. You have been defending Deschamps from the get go even though France have never looked convincing. Similarly, we are entitled to the opinion that he's biased and has mistreated Martial.

Also, imo, his visible disgust when Martial misplaced a pass and then his constant refusal to give him any sort of minutes suggests that he probably does hate Martial. That's all. Opinions.

6635~~~
Obviously. There is a very slight chance that this damages his confidence - but there <i>is</i> still a chance. Also, one or two poor games at the start of the preseason/season and it can pile up. Martial is icy cold though so hopefully he'll be up for it next season.

6636~~~
Wait, you seriously think that he hates Martial?

6637~~~
At least he gets a rest now but he'll still miss most of our preseason.

6638~~~
No. More like he doesn't rate Martial.

6639~~~
Funnily enough people said the same thing about Payet.

6640~~~
What else is the explanation? I know you really like Deschamps but can you explain why he didn't give Martial some minutes today? You need your game changers to be ready/on form when they are needed. Even if he can not get in the starting lineup, he is surely a game changer - unless you think Gignac will rescue France when they are 1,2 down.

6641~~~
Reminds me of the time that idiot Domenech kept subbing on the useless Govou in the second half of every game in WC 2010

6642~~~
His direct competition is not Gignac, while he can play there his direct competition is actually Payet

6643~~~
As I've said I don't expect him to start so I mean from the bench. If it's not Gignac who is brought on, it's Martial. Ergo, direct competition.

6644~~~
That's non-sense to me. Germany will be the first major test for France. So far, the team has been overwhelmingly superior to their opponents talent wise. The Germany game will be crucial in the judgement of Deschamps. You can say the result is only secondary in that judgement, because football can simply go that way, but whether France will be set up for success and gain control over the match will depend on Deschamps' decision. Make no mistake, that's where he will and deserves to be judged. 

As for Martial, I've said before that this is how you pretty much have to manage in big tournaments. You try to give everybody a fair chance in the group stages, but by the elimination round you need a small amount of players you can trust. Unfortunately for Martial, he had a poor 45 minutes against Albania, which was the nail in the coffin for him. Coman has hardly impressed either, but at least has been solid, so gets the nod over him. It's irrelevant whether Martial is possibly the better player, Coman is simply more trustworthy in the eyes of Deschamps right now, who is under major pressure to win the tournament (rightfully so). It doesn't help Martial that Payet has surprised many and that Griezmann, probably their best player up front, has shown balls of steel in key moments. 

The one mistake I will say Deschamps has made is not giving Martial 10 to 15 more minutes in the second half of the Albania game to see whether he can turn it around with a bit of criticism and advice at half time. It seemed like a rushed decision and I think that rushed decision is probably the reason some believe he never really rated Martial that highly in the first place. 

Irrespective of Martial, the decision to continue to trust Gignac is cringeworthy to me. I understand Deschamps likes a target man up front and aside of Giroud, that's his only option in that regard, but if that's the case, I would contemplate a slightly adjusted gameplan because Gignac is simply not the quality you need up there.

6645~~~
Cantona doesn't like him does he? If he doesnt then neither do I.

6646~~~
You people that say "well atleast he is resting and wont get injured" - Would it not have been better for him to not go euros all together and join up with the squad for a propper preason? 

As it stands, he will have a 3 week break after this week. Joins the squad in the first week of August. That pretty much rules him out of the charity shield and im sure he wont be ready to play in the first game vs Bournemouth on the 13th.

Over to you Memphis...

6647~~~
That sounds like the English philosophy though.

This French team is set up to play in a certain way. Their manager has them playing in a manner that's getting good results. Gignac is a like for like replacement for that system. I think fair play to him for sticking to his plan when needed.

Far better to have 11 players knowing a system rather than adjusting to fit better players in and players having to adapt.

I still think he's a tactically flexible coach, he does switch it up when needed. But he's clearly worked out his blueprint for Plan A.

6648~~~
It's not just about the tournament though, he's been making sensible choices since he took over. Like I said, whatever happens against Germany (it will be a very tight match), Deschamps will be appreciated like rarely a french coach has been in the last 10-15 years.

Not giving Martial more minutes isn't a mistake, I only see this spouted on Utd boards <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. You would think Deschamps is preventing a Ballon d'Or from playing. The french fans, the medias, no one care that much about Martial as long as the team doesn't need and France hasn't truly needed him so far. Whatever he can bring can be covered and better at the moment with Payet and Coman.
THE mistake Deschamps may have made is not taking another striker instead of Schneiderlin because Gignac, despite his goals in Mexico, is just not up to the level anymore. Morgan is pointless, again what he can bring is easily and better covered by others.

 Cantona can be known to have stupid opinions though.

Coman is ahead of him in the pecking order and like you said "You need your game changers to be ready/on form when they are needed." That and the fact that Giroud and Koscielny had yellow cards and could have been suspended for the Semi final. There is your explanation.

Martial will be the last option to play as a striker, Griezmann is still ahead of him when it comes to playing as a striker so he isn't truly Gignac's direct competition.

6649~~~
Every big player have video clips from big tournaments as young lads sitting on the bench like they're no one. This only makes me more certain he will succeed.

6650~~~
That's simply false. There is no rigid rule for substitutions, you adapt for the game. I've seen strikers or wingers pulled off for centre mids, and vice versa.  If gignac isn't brought on, perhaps sissoko is brought on? Martial would never come on if France are looking to close out a game, and as we've seen, if France are looking to recover from a deficit, deschamps goes to coman, then gignac, then the rest (martial/sissoko etc). But to say that there is a strict rule that if gignac doesn't come on, martial does, is not true.

6651~~~
Except Low doesn't use a second striker in the mold of Gomez and instead has thrown Draxler or Gotze up there for the number 9 role. Hence it is possible to adjust without throwing your entire game plan overboard if some players are significantly better than others.

6652~~~
Because we don't have another one. The situation on number 9s is absolutely dire over here. We don't even have anything in the pipeline for the coming years.
It's Gomez or bust. So, when he's not available we have to make do with different set ups. More often than not, we performed on a lower level than with a true target man like Klose or Gomez.

6653~~~
The less he plays the better for us, he needs a break after carrying our attack last season. He will get his chance on the international stage, Payet and Giroud won't be around for much longer and he's better than Coman.

6654~~~
That's exactly my point. You don't have any quality available when it comes to strikers in the mold of Gomez. Low wouldn't nominate somebody like Gignac just for the sake of having another player type like him available.

6655~~~
If we had someone on Gignacs level, he'd be in the squad. He might not be a triple A player, but he's good enough to warrant the attention of a defense, and has a strong physical presence.
Our next best No9 is Sandro Wagner, a prototype transhuman donkey who played for Darmstadt, a relegation team with the budget of one your 3rd league teams.

6656~~~
But he nominated Podolski.

6657~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> who is easily a worse player than Gignac.

6658~~~
Owned!

Can't believe people buy into Deschamps' discrimination case. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

6659~~~
Don't think anyone believes in that, he's just made irrational decisions after France were 4-0 up. Future (Germany game) will show if he's right, he may well be seeing none of his crucial players got injured (tons of crunching tackles from Iceland) so perhaps luck can be on his side and none of said players will be knackered ,3 days after, to play the game of their lives.

And as for some already boring suggestions from the French on here, not many people were saying 'just put Martial on you stupid feck' but more like 'why aren't you taking one or two important players at the interval and other(s) after an hour'?

6660~~~
Its as simple as this for me. Lets just say United had a player like Andy Carroll for next season, I would still much rather have Rashford coming on for Ibra rather than him.

6661~~~
You can't compare club season with an international tournament. You can throw League Cup, FA Cup games, even lesser PL games away for your youngsters. With international games, you need every chance to hone your playing plan and build belief among team members. Thing is pretty much set in motion before the tournament. And in tournament it's more of sticking to plan than figuring a new plan. See what happened to England who still can't find a plan into the knock out round? Shuffling playing style and players did any help to boost England belief?

As underwhelming as Portugal, as long as they keep up with their "don't lose plan" they have every chance to the final, even fancy winning it.

National team don't develop players during tournament. They relies on federation to plan the direction of talent and clubs to develop players for them. They use qualifier and friendly to choose the best squad and experiment to pick the best playing style. That's all to it.

I said when Rashford was picked into the squad that I rather him stayed home and started full pre seasoned with Mourinho as it would benefit him more than exposed to current England team under Hodgson. The environment under Hodgson doesn't look good, so that kind of experience is not so valuable.

6662~~~
Not going to address the fact you've pulled in Andy Carroll from somewhere.

France have a system that has a good target man that facilitates their wide, creative forwards space to play in. Ordinarily they'd have Benzema who would play the same role as Giroud, and probably leave Giroud as the back up.

They currently play a system like Madrid. Centre forward with two wide forwards wreaking havoc. Putting Martial up top would potentially lessen the impact of Payet and Griezmann.

Frances two best attacking players of the tournament are thriving. It would be madness for Deschamps to mess with that.

I'd criticise him for starting Gignac up top and Giroud wide left. But he's not doing that. He's got good players playing very well offensively.

Maybe by the next World Cup you'll see France playing a more fluid front three as Barca do, with no target man as such. But for this tournament, they wont screw with whats working.

6663~~~
Great response, appreciated mate.


Good luck against the Germans - allez les bleus

6664~~~
You clearly weren't reading posts IMHO. What irrational decision did Deschamps make ?

6665~~~
I picked Andy Carroll as an example for a supposed like for like change with Ibra. Compared to Rashford changing for Ibra.

I guess this is my main point of disagreement. I don't think replacing Giroud with Martial will be that detrimental to how Payet and Griezeman are playing.

6666~~~
Now is not the time to find out...

6667~~~
5-1 up in a game isn't the time to find out?

6668~~~
He's not been playing but imo just being part of this group of players seems to be an amazing learning experience. 

Morale seems quite high ,and Deschamps has been done a wonderful job here so far. Think of the nonsense like Knysna in the past and it's just amazing how the Benzema saga didn't crack them .

6669~~~
I'm not too bothered, as long he comes back fit. We have a long season ahead!

6670~~~
They're playing better, certainly, without Deschamps squeezing every good player into the side. Surprised he's not getting time killing minutes though given his control and pace, but so be it. Will make him hungry to focus on our season

6671~~~
Exactly 

Deschamp seems to be doing the exact thing that a lot of England fans have complained about. He has built a team rather than individuals.

Martial will learn from this . Ronaldo didn't even play at the 94   world cup.

6672~~~
I think he should be playing though. For most of the game Payet really doesn't do much. Yeah sometimes he comes up with some wonder goal but Martial could have ripped Kimmich a new one.

6673~~~
Coman usually comes on if they make changes though, Martial should get a chance at least though

6674~~~
Yeah he does. Either would be good. Coman probably should be ahead of Martial as he has played better for France. That's understandable given Martial's fatigue.

6675~~~
Coman has the advantage of pbeing able to play in the left and right. 
Anyway, I hope the experience fires him up. I am sure he's going to be one of the first names on the team sheet soon.

6676~~~
No injury and just one more game to go - excellent!

6677~~~
this.

6678~~~
Honestly, I dont mind him not playing. He seems tired and hopefully will get a proper rest soon. Wasnt he also slightly injured?

6679~~~
Martial and paddys job is to tap Pogba up. Martial wasn't good when he played but he's shown fair quality in his games pre tournament. I think Martial should get some minutes in the final. Coman hasn't really set the world alight either.

6680~~~
Why do people say it's good he's having rest. He's training as hard as the rest of the team. Game experience would've been invaluable for him. Stop saying he's having "rest".

6681~~~
Hey relax fella, you need a rest guy.

6682~~~
He played a lot of football and you cant go on and train all the time. He looked jaded. Dont know why that's so hard to understand. All our players were requested to take a 3 weeks break as well

6683~~~
Why are you saying he needs a rest? He's thinking hard about his posts and the experience of posting in the mains is invaluable to him.

6684~~~
What that guy is saying is, Martial isn't exactly chilling. He is still training as if he is going to play the next match and that is not resting. I think FIFA/EUFA request every club give its players 3 weeks off after tournaments, not just us.

6685~~~
Training and playing matches is not the same though

6686~~~
I agree, but he is not resting either.

6687~~~
To be fair, they are mostly maintaining fitness at the big tournaments - they don't have the time or energy to train harder. And while the starters have been given excessive loads, having to play every 3-4 days and sometimes even for 120 minutes, those who don't play are basically on a vacation (but hitting a hotel gym every morning).

6688~~~
There won't be much training anyway. They're playing a game every three or four days. The gaps in between will mostly be recuperation.

6689~~~
Compared to game time he is absolutely having a 'rest'.

Continous short or extended bursts of speed with and without the ball dozens of times, physically extending your body against other 10-14 stone footballers, being mentally alert every second of the game, diving into, riding over, shielding tackles etc etc are not the things you're doing in training in a tournament format.

It's sad for him but at the same time it'll only prolong his career for the long term. His game isn't like Ronaldo where he's involved in simple build up play and hanging around up the 3rd half of the pitch. He's a dynamic wing-forward, who's disciplined and fulfils his defensive duties.

6690~~~
Give Martial #7 and give Depay #14 and then give Ibra #9

Solved.

6691~~~
Depay seems to have built a brand on his number with his whole 'M7' thing. Bet he wouldn't take it well.

Not that we should care about a single persons feelings...

6692~~~
Martial can take over it. Being "M" after all.

6693~~~
Ha can you imagine the hate between them? If Martial was to suddenly turn up to training in a M7 branded G Wagon.

6694~~~
Actually, I could see Memphis offering a M7 branded gift to Martial.

6695~~~
He hasn't be over worked during the euros anyway so at least he should come back fresh to us.

6696~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l7C8Awyd8tw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Good vybes over there anyway.

But that training team seems a little unfair. I mean Martial, Coman, Pogba and Payet on one side?

6697~~~
Where was Martial in all of that?

Edit: oh shit he scored it

6698~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVnrDZ7clHc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>
This guy is so sick, the way he turns defenders left and right is crazy. Him and Miki are going to tear it up next season.

6699~~~
Well done Deschamps. Thats what happens when you dont give a guy minutes and expect him to bring a game back alive with 10 minutes to go.

Horrible management.

6700~~~
Stubborn tool he is, more talent than Coman and Gignac combined.

6701~~~
Cantona knows what Deschamps is. A manager thinking about bringing Cabaye on in extra time over Martial doesn't deserve to win.

6702~~~
Come back home Tony!

6703~~~
12 years ago, Ronaldo won the FA Cup in his first season here before losing a Euro final on home soil.

Looking forward to having Anthony back home and under a decent manager.

6704~~~
Correct.

6705~~~
Nice one !

6706~~~
Should of started as France main striker throughout the tournament.

6707~~~
I've been pissed off at his non inclusion for the last few games. When it went to extra time i even said 'i bet Portugal score and he suddenly throws Martial on'.

Deschamps screwed France over big time. Martial is the best French attacker. Payet deserved to play because he's been brilliant, but Coman and especially Gignac should not have been ahead of Martial. He should have kept giving him time to get settled and in form over the competition.

6708~~~
Feel for the French residents on Redcafe. The loss is painful enough. Many United fans are too blinded by their bias into blindness.

Deschamps' biggest weakness is his one dimensional tactic. He built team a solid team based on team spirit and togetherness. He is pragmatic and doesn't have much magic changing attacking tactic, I can give you that. But Martial can have the same criticism for him: one dimensional attacking style.(He will learn from this and improve as he is young). Martial can be the best young player in the world but he is one the lesser team player for France this tournament.

All the OTT reaction here is knee jerk. What if Gignac scored (hit the post one) in the injury time. Would you guys here bashing Deschamps for his sub. SAF is well regarded because his magic subs. Not many managers can do the same. Red glinted glasses off please.

France had been doing well this tournament. Deschamps and his team can have his head held high. Their game vs Germany is tactically second best only to Italy vs Spain. Have the more convincing hames of all the teams in this tournament IMO, despite is a lesser favorite for the tournament. Deschamps and his team can have his head held high. Portugal has been better with some luck when it matters and win it.

6709~~~
Martial has a one dimensional attacking style, Do you watch Untied games at all?

What if Gignac scored - But he didn't, did he. Gignac was the go to sub in every game, why make your go to sub the guy that is exactly like your number one striker but inferior? The sub should bring something else to the table and Gignac doesn't bring nothing else to the table. 

The German game, from a neutral point of view I thought Germany played well but they lacked a striker. One of the main reasons I felt France would do well this tournament was because of their attacking options. France have the best selection of attacking talent amongst all the European teams for me. Yet, someone like Gignac manages to be the first option of that selection. Thats nothing for Deschamps to hold his 'head high' about.

Deschamps should have better prepared Martial for a moment like today. instead he exiled him and then rushed him on at the very possible last chance.

6710~~~
Don't understand the clamour for him to start. He was terrible against Albania. 
Most importantly he isn't injured. Gets his rest and comes back better.

6711~~~
this

6712~~~
Yes. Martial's play making and crossing is not well refined. He is more of dribbling wiz at the moment. Still lack presence for the target and long ball hold up play.He has been improving his finishing, but not your big moment hitter yet. Similar to Ronaldo in his first Euro final where he despite looking positive (I said Deschamps is one dimensional and pragmatic in his tactic too didn't I?)but one dimensional.

You can only give out tactic for what comes before you. Italy had a master class before Spain but failed against Germany. Would France is more higher rated before this tournament than Spain?

With logic in Gignac hit the post chance then Messi whole international career < Ronaldo <20 minutes this game.

I am slating Martial. I am here saying he is young and this experience will boost him. Ronaldo is forever cry baby, but he has grown so much since his famous final defeat cry. Martial can do one and be the best out there with us.

6713~~~
Exactly!

6714~~~
Why not give him a few minutes here and there if you have to rely on him eventually in the final? That was what everyone was saying.

6715~~~
I am defending Deschamps here, but perhaps Martial is the only remaining (best) attacking option left? Deschamps fecked up by not anticipating for this dire scenario, may be? Deschamps was too pragmatic and tried to go to penalty shoutout. What's done is done.

As I said in one of my previous posts in this thread, the preparation was done in friendlies. In tournament, ideally there should not be so much changes around. Young players aren't necessarily given the development minutes like club footballs. The tourney squad is pretty much established since the first game starts. Mostly only established players are included in the squad, even the young one (except cases like Ronaldo in WC2014, Kaka WC2002... not playing, just there to build them up for the future). If they can perform when they're called upon, then good. If not, good luck next time.

6716~~~
I don't know how anyone can defend Deschamps. They were the stronger team and he was so fundamentally negative in his approach that he prevented that from winning them the game.

Target men are well and good but that played into Pepe and Fonte's strengths.

When you are the better team being that negative and safe with your tactics and subs is just criminal.

It's not abotu Martial although how he can be expected to do anything in ten minutes is ridiculous, its about the stupidity of swapping like for like (Giroud/Gignac) when that is proving ineffective and leaving the subs so late. Sissoko was fine but it was clear wit and ingenuity was going to be needed not power and pace and Deschamps resisted that until it was too late.

6717~~~
Time for a nice long break. We need him fit for the start of the season <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

6718~~~
Delighted that he hardly played. The last thing that we want is our 20 year old star player playing all through the summer on the back of a season where he played far too many games anyway. Not sure why he should've played anyway, it seems that he was competing with Coeman for game time, who did really well whenever he played.
He probably should've come on in the final instead of Gignac in fairness but apart from that he can't have too many complaints, especially considering his performance V Albania.

6719~~~
Stop being selfish and understand that Martial like any other(or most) professional players out there would love to be given the honor to play for their national team on the biggest stage like Euro, WC etc.

Playing a few more games at the Euro wouldn't have hampered him or exhausted him like some of you lots like going on about. This relief about him missing out n the action just highlight the selfishness about some supporters rather than showing concern about the kid's health or whatever you people like to dress it as.

Every time I read about how this 20 year playing at the Euro would have been detrimental for him I just keep rolling my eyes <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

If anything tournaments like these give one(especially a youngster) so much more confidence going forward, not the opposite or anything negative of sort.

6720~~~
Swapping Giroud for Gignac makes no sense as they are similar players who offer the same thing, when you are looking to change things up surely you would put a different style of player on. Very bizarre imo.

Martial has been brilliant for us last season and i'm sure he could have contributed a lot more than Gignac. France's lost in the end.

6721~~~
I'm happy martial finally got some rest. He's played twice the minutes Coman played last season. LvG really overworked him last season.

6722~~~
And Griezmann?  I don't think Deschamps had a bad starting line up,  but Martial should have come on regularly at the 60 min mark for Giroud.  There was no logic in giving Gignac the automatic sub position.  Effectively, both of them were the same type of player.

6723~~~
Griezmann was better in behind.

6724~~~
Deschamps is a fecking idiot for not playing Martial more. Felt sorry for the lad sitting on the bench every game watching the likes of Gignac get on in front of him. Oh well at least he's not injured and will be back starting for United next season to prove Deschamps and anyone else who is still doubting him wrong.

6725~~~
Deschamps is a bang average coach. Best squad in the tournament by a stretch, home crowd, sunk by fecking Éder.

6726~~~
Got to say, I'm pretty pleased he didn't play any more than he did. He's had more than enough football the last year.

6727~~~
I'd have let Giroud finish the entire match instead of bringing Gignac. His sub didn't make any sense even if he played badly cause whatever the match scenario, Gignac makes us instantly weaker. I still cannot believe players Gameiro and Lacazette weren't taken before him for the Euro.

6728~~~
If you stayed in the game, the changes were predictable and so was the game plan. If you had a defender that could head the ball, that pretty much ended their attacking threat. France had two of the fastest outside players that could have created problems but he never explored them.....

6729~~~
Thought the same thing yesterday when the sub was made and throughout the tournament.  I could only put the sub down to Deschamps having a preference for a target man striker and so the likes of Martial, Lacazette and Gameiro are not really considered the type of player he wants in the position to partner Griezmann.

Would Gignac have gotten in the squad if Benzema had been eligible to go?

6730~~~
Although I'd love for Martial to get 7, I can't help but feel that we should just leave him to it. Don't want to add any undue pressure after a stellar first season. Let him play and enjoy his football rather than push this on him. Seems more if a statement to take it off someone than to be given it when you sign.

6731~~~
I suspect he somehow would have <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>. Gignac isn't a true target man either.

6732~~~
I din't see him in any of the training pics?

6733~~~
He's not in the photo's but in the video Utd posted he is there in the background when they are doing the Rondo, so he is OK. 

Probably just shied away from the camera <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

6734~~~
If we are to achieve anything this season, he needs to start firing. Our most talented player by some distance and the only player that can consistently go past players.

6735~~~
I'm sure he will be fine. He hardly had a pre season remember, all players take a while to get going 100%.

6736~~~
You think he's more talented than Pogs.... by some distance?

6737~~~
Just to not confuse things - this is last season's performance thread. The one for this season is: <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/anthony-martial-2016-17-performances.419580/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/anthony-martial-2016-17-performances.419580/</a>

6738~~~
This is going to be a hard season for him... he's kind of the forgotten man, believe it or not.  With Ibra, Rooney and Mkhitaryan...  not to mention Pogba, I hope he's not forgotten.  It would be a shame.
