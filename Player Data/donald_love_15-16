What's everybody's thoughts on this lad then? 

He seems okay and looks like he wants to get forward quite a bit. Can't see him getting ahead of Darmian or Varela though.

2~~~
You mean Douglas?

3~~~
Awful.

4~~~
Not good enough. But it's not his fault the squad is so light.

5~~~
You know those dreams where you're naked in front of a room of people, giving a speech about a topic you don't understand?

This performance is the football equivalent of that dream.

Hard not to feel sorry for him, he's so far out of his depth.

6~~~
Not good. 

Not his fault though - he was never ready.

7~~~
certainly not his fault bearing in mind he's been thrown in, and is probably 6th choice right back

Darmian, Valencia, Jones,Varela, Young

8~~~
Yeah, he's not very good.

Really poor on that second goal.

9~~~
He is pretty appalling to be honest. Shouldn't be anywhere near our team.

10~~~
A horrible performance but he shouldn't be in this team. Can't be too hard on him.

11~~~
What the feck is this guy doing getting a start for us. Feck me our standards have dropped so much in recent years. But I guess it's another youngster that LvG has brought through, right?

12~~~
Cant fault his effort but not good enough.

13~~~
Awful. I mean, he is about our 17th choice, but still. We're Manchester United, surely even our youth standards should be a bit higher quality?

14~~~
There are 14 players out injured of which half are full backs. That's why.

15~~~
Another mere number on the conveyer belt of mediocrity coming from our academy in the last 20 years.

16~~~
How do those guys even play for our youth? How far off being good enough can one be?

17~~~
I couldn't give a feck. We have given games to far too many players that are nowhere near good enough in recent years.

18~~~
At least he showed a bit of fecking effort tonight, even if he is shite.

19~~~
Hard to judge a player under these circumstance. That might just have ruined his career here....

20~~~
So whats the solution have 10 first choice fullbacks?

21~~~
Great contribution. Well done lad.

22~~~
Thank God Van Gaal's our manager. If we had Mourinho, a talent like this would have never had a chance.

23~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> You are the one bitching that our 7th choice RB isn't good enough. If its such a problem, I want to hear your solution.

24~~~
Id rather of played Schneiderlin at right back.

25~~~
Well the thread is about him so I'll express my opinion that he's shit in said thread. Make sense?

26~~~
Yup or even Herrera.

27~~~
He's a victim of circumstance. I feel sorry for him, he doesn't deserve to make his debut in these conditions.

28~~~
Great contribution. Well done lad.

29~~~
Attacking-wise he's done a few good things, but I certainly haven't been impressed with his defensive side of things.

30~~~
Thanks <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

31~~~
I thought he did fine against Sunderland but he struggled tonight, but given the shower of shit going on around him from more seasoned players I think it's harsh to be overly critical of him, he at least looked up for the fight which is more than can be said for several others.

32~~~
He's been thrown into a team very low on confidence, despite playing pretty well in the last few games, except the Sunderland game and tonight. May not turn out to be good enough for us, but its his second game (1st start) for us, and if we're being honest, he wouldn't be playing if we didn't have so many injuries. 

That said, Borthwick Jackson was someone quite a few weren't keen on when he first come into the team. Since he's had a run of games, his confidence has grown, and he's actually looked very promising.

33~~~
Even though I never thought he's good enough, that was a strange performance.Looks like he couldn't cope with the pressure.Didn't help that the senior players were also struggling.

34~~~
Can't think of a worse time for a young lad to have his first start in the team. Away in Europe in an already injury plagued side bereft of direction and leadership, where most of the players look like they couldn't really give a sh*t about the result.

It was a sketchy performance from him but then again he didn't stand out as being particularly sh*tter than most of his team mates.

35~~~
There's just no doubt in 5 years you'll have a look and he'll be at Morecambe. Harsh but true (well, might make a decent player but not good enough for us). Our academy keeps serving up average players these days.

36~~~
He tried at least, but wasn't very good at it.

37~~~
The Donald Love from GTA3 is probably a better player and he's just a poorly drawn polygon figure.

38~~~
This sums it up for me, unfortunate timing.

39~~~
not good enough but not his fault

CBJ looks better if we're comparing full backs

40~~~
Herrera can't defend and he's never played there. He would look completely lost. He looked worse in his normal position than Love did on his debut.

41~~~
its not true, you cant generalize like that, players cant be put in the same bracket but can be put in the same team regardless their talent... thats up to manager who he gives the chance and also circumstances like injuries make it a lot more unpredictable.. Darmian, Valencia, Young, Jones, Varela and I certainly forgot someone else who would be able to play right back ahead of Love. He's not good enough as 7th rightback, hardly sruprising we dont have a cover for 6th right back. there will always be average players like Love, Weir, Lawrence, McNair who will move on in the end..

but it's not the good enough talents who are developed well these days and we have them, Pereira, Januzaj would perhaps thrive under better manager, CBJ, Tuanzebe, Williams, TFM... etc to name others.. also we are in deep shit, throwing players in the team like that won't do good to anyside

42~~~
This.

43~~~
Yes but you asked why he was starting, you didn't just say he was shit.

44~~~
My bad, I suppose it was more of a rhetorical question. I'm just sick of sub-standard players getting games for the club. I wasn't actually looking for a detailed discussion regarding injuries etc.

45~~~
Our fans keep harping on about how the manager must be willing to promote youth, but where is the quality youth players coming through? This one is another average player.

46~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> FFS

47~~~
Hard to be too critical, he tried his best but he isn't good enough and is only playing because there are no other options. 

There is a huge difference between promoting young players and having to play them because you have made a mess of the squad, unfortunately it's the latter not the former that applies to us.

48~~~
Clearly he's not good enough for our first team, it's a shame really as you can't fault his effort. When you use the comparison of Borthwick Jackson, you can clearly see the class difference, one looks calm and like nothing can faze him. The other looks like a rabbit in the headlights.

Is Varela injured?

Or is has he been bombed out for saying Van Gaal is hard to figure out.

49~~~
He is injured.

50~~~
Wasn't very good, just clearly isn't ready. 

Not his fault that we can hardly field a starting 11.

51~~~
When we won the treble we had Michael Clegg, John Curtis, Ronny Wallwork, Phil Mulryne, Mark Wilson, Terry Cooke, Jonathan Greening, Erik Nevland and Alex Notman in the first team squad. 6 of them played together in one game.

52~~~
That's good to know. Cheers.

53~~~
From what I've seen so far, our brightest youth prospects don't seem good enough either. Pereira was meant to be class, he's done feck all in the games he's been brought on/started for besides that decent free kick against (I think) Ipswich. Januzaj is failing. CBJ is the most impressive I'd say but the rest haven't even been given a shot in the first team. You can't possibly be happy with what our academy is producing compared to others.

54~~~
OK, he hasn't been good but, for the vast majority of us, we've seen him play twice.

Give the lad a chance

55~~~
Pereira played maybe 40 minutes from total of 40+ games this season, how is he supposed to show anything, stupid to judge himby 8 minutes cameos in most shittest of games as well, Januzaj was class in his first season and wasn't meant to play for Van Gaal who doesnt really fancy players with flair rather goes for consistency and organization, we also palyed like 20 games in 3-5-2 system in which Januzaj doesnt have a spot, then issues with confidence occured and LVG tried him a couple of times but again out of position out of position, whether it was b2b or striker, it's quite a joke isn't it, he never got a run of 10 games like Memphis did.. the loan was unfortunate, he's not ready to play at the level required elsewhere than from the wing now.. he still has a good chance, this manager just sucks with his system, Pochettino would make a great player form Januzaj IMO, like he's trying with Lamela. Under LVG Januzaj only stagnated or regressed.. these two are great talents and counting with CBJ, three in three years would be a fantastic achievement.. how are we producing only average players, how many first teamers are across al big clubs in Europe. We are just in deep shit overall and blame youngsters for their lack of talent in a crysis like this is stupid, no you dont need to blame them, call them not good enough. Itsvery tough for some players to get going in a dysfunctional team like this... no question

56~~~
That just about sums him up and many others coming through our system. Then, the ones that look like they could do it don't seem to be handled correctly or not given the chance when they should be

57~~~
Mulryne is a priest now, isn't he?

58~~~
Yep. The only player I thought could make in here in the last 5 years is Pogba, and he was shipped off really quickly.

59~~~
how was he able to start an actual game, and then not even be on the bench for the next game.
Odd stuff.

60~~~
You probably didn't rate Drinkwater or Simpson really highly either. They might become PL champions this season with a different club.

61~~~
To be fair Simpson never really stood out as a quality defender.
I don't think the club is to blame for Fergie's reluctance to start him.

62~~~
He is cup tied. Personally I'd rather Riley was playing anyway.

63~~~
have to chuckle!

Luckily Varela was back. Although the "Joy" at that and BJ being back was incredible!

A few months before, the idea of those two being starting full backs would be a diaster

64~~~
Couldn't agree more, I was saying the same to my dad last night. I actually think Jackson is composed enough to stick around the first team permanent now, as for Varela, time will tell. 

Love is a total disaster though.

65~~~
Yeah, regrettably Love has zero chance of making it here. 21 already, didn't look good in his bit of playing time, and is already about 5th choice there at best, in one of our weakest sets of defenders in 20 years.

I'd love to see how clinical Mourinho would be. I just hope it's a done deal and he's getting a real headstart on what needs doing. Unlike Van Gaal who was deeply involved in the world cup til very late

66~~~
You going through a rough patch? Aw <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Donald is atrocious though, yes

67~~~

68~~~
Love really shouldn't be speaking to anybody, especially the media.

69~~~
Being 1 of the better players in a 2-1 loss to Sunderland isn't something to be that proud about.
Immature error
