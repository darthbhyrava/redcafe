hello.

2~~~
How are you good sir? Did you like Blackett's performance?

3~~~
It was pretty good for him, I thought. Still don't think he has a remote chance of making it here.

4~~~
Reminds me of Richards. No doubt at early age his speed and strength got him out of trouble which meant didn't have to use his brain. Still the same now but less effective at this level. Good squad player but nothing else for me.

5~~~
Got caught out a few times, was on halfway line a couple of times when opposition had the ball. Simply lacks any kind of positional sense when he is playing. Watched him when he was younger and he seemed really good. Makes stupid mistakes even in the reserves, that's why i was so surprised when Thorpe did not get a chance last year.

6~~~
He did ok but he is nowhere near the standard needed to play here. Fully expect him to be in the Championship within 2 years.

7~~~
Wasting our time with him.

8~~~
Let's hope this thread doesn't reach page 2.

9~~~
He's going to feature more this season.

10~~~
I suspect otherwise, I'd think we'll have better luck with injuries this season, especially if we bring in someone like Otamendi and move out Evans. Blind won't be needed as much in midfield, and should be more likely to be available to back up Shaw. 

Though it could certainly happen, especially if he can improve, but a player so wild and undisciplined rarely comes around after showing no sign of doing so for years.

11~~~
Blackest can't be a Lb. He is too stiff.

12~~~
Blackest is too stiff?

13~~~
He doesn't look comfortable, he looks awkward, not loose enough.

14~~~
Ya a LB needs to be loose as fook like <a class="username" data-user="64878, @Rolandofgilead" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64878/">@Rolandofgilead</a>

15~~~
Still better than Evans.

16~~~
Send him on loan. I don't trust him yet to play in our already shaky defence

17~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Enjoyable typo is enjoyable.

18~~~
Hes not even close to being better than Evans.

19~~~
Rojo will most likely be a bench player/backup next season so Blackett will find games very hard to come by. 4th choice left back, 6th choice centre back at best.

20~~~
At least he'll will still be a United player by the end of this transfer window. Evans is a trainwreck

21~~~
I'm not sure Blackett has a spot here for this sesson.
1st tier: Smalling/Jones and New CB
2nd tier: smalling/Jones and Rojo
3rd tier: Blackett
He needs a loan where he can get first team football.

22~~~
Tbh he has only ever looked promising at LB, at CB far too poor concentration and decision making. He's actually quite skilful and good vision as well as the physical attributes.

23~~~
Don't think he'll play another competitive minute here. Loan and then sale.

24~~~
A loan would seem the best for him because as you say he will struggle for games here (unless there is a massive injury crisis... In which case we could recall him from loan anyway)

25~~~
With all the reports of him being an excellent trainer, working with our video analysts in his own time, being attentive to Van Gaals instructions ect ect you've got to wonder if he's being kept around as an example to other youth players that hard work will be rewarded.

26~~~
Think that's a lazy comparison. Richards was far better when he broke through. And whoever said he's better than Evans can't be serious either.

27~~~
He plays with fear. His favorite thing to do is to boot those long diagonal balls as far from his part of the pitch as possible. 

He left Evans to put out fires behind him, yet he didn't get forward to combine with Pereira much.

I'm afraid he isn't good enough and never will be.

28~~~
"Better than Evans" ffs <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

29~~~
Trying him out as a cdm won't hurt .

30~~~
Not even close to being true.

31~~~
He needs to go out on loan.

32~~~
It really would hurt.

33~~~
During pre season? How so?

34~~~
The hate for Evans has gone way too far - Blackett is a carthorse, Evans has performanced in big CL games against world class attacks.

35~~~
The video evidence doesn't support your view. There are 3 instances of Blackett overlapping in Pereira's 5 mins highlights video. 1 min 26 secs, 1 min 58 secs, 2 mins 21 secs. Blackett with the ball attacking the edge of their box 3 mins 51 secs and a good combination move from Pereira and Blackett moving up the field 4 mins 33 secs. And that's just Pereira's highlights nevermind the whole 45 mins !

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h1OMm_NvoDg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

36~~~
So we have a young LB/CB who isn't good enough at LB or CB so we should throw him into CDM? What sense is there in that? We've already got 5/6 actual CDMs that are miles better than Blackett and not to mention the countless others that can and have played there on occasion.

37~~~
He'll never be good enough so what's the point in taking away game time from our actual midfielders? We only have three more games this pre season.

38~~~
I really rate him. I think it will be extremely difficult for him to get into the side but that doesn't mean he is shit. Would love to see him used throughout the season, I'm confident in his ability.

39~~~
Evans is miles better.

Blackett is bang average.

40~~~
Blackett > Jonny Soon to be sold trainwreck Evans

41~~~
Great examples. His critics simply won't see it and will continue to make things up though

42~~~
Not really something to be proud of, just like weighing less then chubby brown it's not fecking hard

43~~~
I'm sorry, but other than the move at 4m 33s I don't see anything to contradict my impression of how he did.

He gets forward, sure, that's basic to his role in the team. But in the video he repeatedly arrives too late and ineffectively which is why he doesn't receive a pass.

Look, feel free to disagree with me, but no one should be surprised when Blackett is moved on.

Perhaps this sounds harsh, but for me the real question is whether he will end up in the Premiership or in the Championship. Given his left foot, athleticism and eagerness to learn, I'm optimistic about him being a Premiership player down the road, just not with Manchester United.

44~~~
Well put it this way, He wouldn't of looked out of place in that Club America side the other night.

45~~~
If Blackett is bang average and Evans is miles better, that means Evans is world class right?

46~~~
Carrick and Schneiderlin are the two recognised cdms. I'm not saying we should make him a permanent cdm, i was just suggesting that we play him one of the games for forty five minutes as a cdm. He has good vision, good physique, and can anticipate a pass so why not?

47~~~
And has choked big time against division 3 teams as well as relegation sides.

48~~~
This seasons Redcafe scape goat.Then again he was last seasons to.

49~~~
Horrible positional discipline, would just abandon his position. Poor at shoulder to shoulder challenges, and the sort of barging and shoving that is crucial to a CB and comes well in handy shielding the back 4 as well. 

He's a fantastic athlete. He's no footballer.

50~~~
Evans is a good defender. Just not good enough for us anymore. He would still be a good buy for Everton or even teams like Valencia. Blackett is so average, will eventually be at Sunderland or someone.

51~~~
Is he really that great an athlete or is it just a lazy excuse to argue why he is at the club? He isn't that strong, doesn't have an immense leap and isn't rapid either. He looks to be decent in terms of physical attributes, but his technique is also quite decent.

52~~~
That was Evans.

53~~~
No,  it was Van gaals stubbornness

54~~~
He's quite clearly never going to have a future here let's be honest. McNair is quite clearly the superior talent and with our improved defensive options even he might struggle here.

Blackett might not even make it as a PL footballer in fact, even though you have to admire his dedication and application to improve his game. He just isn't cut out for United at all.

55~~~
If Evans issue is indeed his  confidence then I agree, but Evans has been so horrible. I know all defenders make errors during games, but he is so freaking mistake prone. It is as if he forgets the basics half the time. I still can't get his horrid performance against mk dons last season out of my head.

56~~~
Agreed we should get rid of him. In terms of defending qualities, he is still much better than Blackett.

57~~~
Last season was Moyes as well: "Well.. this player would've scored but the thing is Moyes just ruined his confidence last season"

58~~~
He was out of his depth during his loan spell at Birmingham which says it all really.

59~~~
He's rapid. I remember him going toe to toe with Liverpool's Jordon Ibe, and Ibe is probably Liverpool's fastest player.

60~~~
I remember him being fast, just not much more than that. Ibe is fast though, so if he could keep up with him his pretty fast. I would think both Jones and especially Smalling being faster, the latter being rapid though.

61~~~
I redefined my comment about  having good vision. Every single time he missed janusaj runs down the left. It was very frustrating.

62~~~
Him and paddy are nice to have around for the tough times. He is a little slow to react to danger at times.

63~~~
He reminds me of him, nothing lazy about that as they have similar attributes. The only laziness is the fact that you've jumped in with both feet assuming that I said he was better that Richards.

64~~~
I didn't assume any such thing. I didn't say you thought Blackett was similar. My point is that they are at incomparable levels, so I found it a bit odd that you immediately found such similarity. Blackett looks a Championship player and Richards was (wrongly) being compared to Maldini.

65~~~
As one of the few that rate Blackett, was pleased to see him set up a goal. Didn't catch the game can anyone let me know how he went overall...

66~~~
The assist for Lingard's goal was his best moment. He and Wilson (who was playing left wing) didn't quite seem to combine well defensively; not sure if that was Wilson's fault or Blackett's. Overall did ok but not amazing; didn't stand out either in a good way or a bad way (really only Januzaj, and to a lesser extent, Darmian and Pereira out of the 22 did).

67~~~
Cheers.

68~~~
Nice to see him get an assist, he's a good athlete and I am sure LvG will be keen to persevere and try to refine his game.

69~~~
Having been hard on him, it's only fair to mention he looked decent against Barca. Like he'd played football.

70~~~
Lets hope blacketts appearances in a united shirt are extremely limited.. wouldnt mind him being sold to mk dons or something.. he cant see passes in front of him and his positional sense is terrible.. he wouldnt get a look in at any other premiership side.

71~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LyykpAioPuA?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

The kid has fancy feet

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lpni2dekeU?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

72~~~
no need to be harsh on him, he was decent in preseason even played out of position. He's not United level potential, on that we can agree. But one never knows in the game of football

73~~~
Are you tyler blackett??

I would rather quentin fortune or mikeal silvestre resigned that blackett. I think I might know more about reading a game or positional sense than him. I reckon blacketts next club is bury or oldham

74~~~

75~~~
fantastic news

76~~~
Amazing that we'll get more for Blackett than Rafael.

77~~~
A loan will definitely be good for him. I'm sceptical whether he'll make the grade for us, but at least this will give him the final test to show whether he can handle a full season at a reasonably top club (in a poor league perhaps). 

We're getting rid of a few CBs aren't we....?

78~~~
Blackett and Janko as your two fullbacks <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> No wonder they couldn't beat Malmo.

79~~~
Out Blackett, comes Fosu-Mensah.

80~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

81~~~
Shouldnt it be Tuanzebe?

82~~~
That's for Evan's thread.

83~~~
What a great news!

84~~~
No idea how he managed to play so much last season. Best of luck to him at Celtic though.

85~~~
Janko, Blackett and Boyata at the back for Celtic. When they lose Van Dijk, they really are fecked in that department.

86~~~
Will be great for him to get a full season of first team football.

87~~~
Confirmed now, hopefully they buy him at the end.

88~~~
Good luck to him.

89~~~
Hope he does well but I am glad he won't be near our defence this season.

90~~~
We'll see how he develops. He'll get some European football too, albeit in the Europa League.

Not convinced he's good enough for us but hope he proves me wrong. Needs to improve his concentration for sure. All the best to him.

91~~~
Thank God he won't be playing for us this year! 

With him and Evans gone, I'm surprised we've not brought in a CB.

92~~~
They only have the scottish league to worry about. They could play Emile Heskey at centre back and win that league.

93~~~
Another United youngster who I expect in time will carve out a decent career but ultimately out of depth at the top.

Good luck to him, I'm sure he will eventually make it back to the PL at some point.

94~~~
Europa League too. They're pretty lucky they didn't qualify for the CL.

95~~~
Do they even have £3m to spend?

96~~~
Yes. They have money but spunk it on shit, usually.

97~~~
Don't understand why he opted for Celtic over the Spanish clubs that were interested. 

Would surely learn more playing in Spain than the bloody SPL.

98~~~
Blackett fits the bill then.

Probably to do with the fact they likely actually didn't want him. Wtf would Valencia be doing loaning Blackett?

99~~~
Yes because Valencia really wanted Blackett. Otamendi to Blackett. Can't go wrong there. I imagine he won't exactly look particularly good at Celtic to be honest.

100~~~
I like Celtic, always have, but they're so poor these days. If they would have got put in a group with Real, PSG and Shakhtar they would have gotten humiliated.

Think Blackett will shine in Scotland though.

101~~~
I used to genuinely enjoy watching them but never 'supported' them per se. They have turned into an absolute mess in recent years. I remember the days of Mjalby, Valgaeren, Petta, Agathe, Larsson, Sutton etc, were genuinely good days for the club under O'Neill. A-lot of those players made the most of their abilities and gave their all for the club, even extremely limited players like Balde. Nowadays they they sign relatively unknown talents like Ki, Wanayama and Van Dijk, to make a a profit in a year or two. The majority of their players are not at the required standard to do anything whatsoever in Europe.

I don't think Blackett will do much there. Boyata is having a mare so far and I would say they are about equal in terms of talent. I really don't rate Blackett at all, though.

102~~~
I think that's a decent move for him. Good luck to him there. Not sure if he will be back here or not, but I'll look out for his progress over this season for sure.

103~~~
Good career move for him.  He needs to develop the mental side of his game and will get more games in the SPL than he would in other leagues.

104~~~
Hope he does well. Boyata has gone up there and has looked a donkey. He can't be any worse.

105~~~
I rate him higher than the majority and really think he has a chance at United. I think it's a good move and really wish him well.

106~~~
Obviously the club don't think he has much of a chance if there is a clause to buy him for £3m. I don't rate him at all, in fact, I think he's awful and not even Championship standard. Each to their own I guess.

107~~~
I also seem to like him more the majority, but I'm not optimistic any more about loans. Off the top of my head in recent years: Macheda, Fabio, Cleverly, Petrucci, Welbeck, Keane and Powell. These players mostly left or not really our level (Powell & Keane). I hope Blackett's fate will be better!

108~~~
I think he got himself a great club personally. Celtic will dominate the league and the pressure is much lower than at say Burnley or Blackburn. He would have been tested much more though.

109~~~
Agreed, I think the main positive I'm taking from this loan, is that he will be at the top of the table. If he can get into the team and cement a spot, he will do really well and gain the experience but lower on a league ladder, one mistake and he could be out of the team or shifted around etc due to the pressure of a relegation scrap.

110~~~
Wont be back sadly

111~~~
Good luck to him. Personally, can't see the talent. To me, he was only a part of the first team because of his preferred foot. 

With him and Evans gone, hopefully we'll move Rojo as a back-up LB and get a central defender before the window shuts.

112~~~
should have sent him on a championship loan instead

113~~~
Starting for Celtic against Aberdeen.

114~~~
Awful defending on Aberdeen's winner.

115~~~
Unsurprising <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

116~~~
He's nowhere near good enough for United.

117~~~
He's not a great defender.

118~~~
He is not a defender.

119~~~
Oh, Blackett..

120~~~
Watching Celtic tonight, guy is benched. Is he playing much these days?

121~~~
Watching him tonight, he is so bad. Shaky, nervous and making poor calls. We should let Celtic keep him on a free.

Twitter gone mad: <a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=news&amp;q=blackett&amp;src=typd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=news&amp;q=blackett&amp;src=typd</a>

122~~~
They are tearing him a new asshole on there

123~~~
Poor guy, he's nowhere near good enough. I feel for him tonight.

124~~~
Going from a very decent pairing of Denayer and Van Dijk, to to having to pick between Boyata, Blackett and Ambrose. Christ. Total bombscares, the three of them.

125~~~
Blackett's being hauled off... Poor kid.

126~~~
He's a textbook Championship defender. Big, strong bloke with little defensive nous.

127~~~
And all of this happened because he was left footed.

128~~~
Came on as a sub early on, 60 minutes later he's subbed off. Was outpaced and outclassed by a team that will finish 5-7th in the Norwegian league. I think we can safely say that this guy won't be playing for United again.

129~~~
He never looked likely to be united quality, but I have to say I'm surprised he's doing so badly at Celtic's level.

130~~~
I'm not surprised.He's one of the worse defenders I've seen at United U21s in the last few years in terms of defending.He just has that tendency to have concentration lapse and positional error regardless of level he's playing at.That can be coached out for some players but doesn't look like it for him.

131~~~
He couldn't defend at reserve level and looked out of his depth when on loan in the Championship. Not a defender.

132~~~
Shame but, won't be back

133~~~
No surprises at how bad he's been. He's simply nowhere near good enough. I can't believe he actually got some games for us.

134~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/9251137/23/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/9251137/23/</a>

Poor guy is getting roasted.

135~~~
Hopefully this is a wake up call for those who still believe just because LVG saw the lads in training everyday means he's always right.

136~~~
<i>
On the odd occasion over the decades I've seen a player in a Celtic strip who looks as if he's bid big in an auction in order to be allowed to make a cameo appearance on the pitch. Blackett looks like he stole the strip off the winning bidder in the tunnel. He really is spectacularly abysmal.
</i>
Sorry but <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

137~~~
Don't like seeing a young lad like this being roasted. Especially since it's well known he was so eager to learn from LvG

138~~~
I'm eager to learn from van Gaal too, doesn't mean I should ever play for United. He is just simply no where near good enough.

139~~~
My memory of him was in the game: he was the last defender against 2 attackers: one was far left, hugging the line; and the other was on the center. And he went chasing that far left, leaving the center one free to go through on goal. Instantly knew that he didn't have footballing brain as a defender.

140~~~
Sad to see but some of the responses on their forum <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

141~~~
He's one of the most nervous players I've seen. It's a shame he's being totally roasted but his performances are rotten.

142~~~
Typical young defender, needs an experienced head beside him. Shame there are those who are using his performance to lament Van Gaal for ever playing him. Not saying he's ever going to make it at the top level, but isn't as bad as as being made out on here. 
Van Gaal should be praised for giving our youth players a chance, lad came in during a injury hit time for United and did a job. Now he's out on loan and we get comments like he won't be back, he has a contract to 2017, so really if you don't want him back you'd be better off hoping he'll play well, not lavishing in a poor performance & using it to have a pop at the manager.

143~~~
It goes with a post i said that possesion football is a quality way of finding out which players are best under pressure.  If you dont give games to the likes of blackett and mcnair you aren't going to find out which players are capable and which aren't.  It isnt a video game where players are attributed by their strengths and weaknesses. 

In that proccess van gaal found Mcnair to be really useful and blackett to be not so much.

144~~~
What's happened to Blackett? Last season everyone was talking future captain material.

145~~~
On loan at Celtic and has looked out of his depth when he has played. Should never have got games for us.

146~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://bluekipper.com/articleimages/1361610070-MoyesyLaugh.jpg" src="http://bluekipper.com/articleimages/1361610070-MoyesyLaugh.jpg"/> 

Shocking defender. Celtic fans want the back of him. Big and quick but not an ounce of intelligence in how he plays. Your typical lower league defender.

147~~~
On loan to Celtic. No idea how he's doing, only has 2 appearances though.

148~~~
Whoever said that needs their head testing.

He's bloody awful.

149~~~
Him and McNair are the Boumsong and Bramble. I can't believe we gave Blackett a new contract.

150~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

151~~~
Need to recall him. No fecking joke.

152~~~
Future lies in the lower divisions, atrocious isn't the word.

153~~~
He's getting found out in the SPL. Even a league 2 team wouldn't be his level.

154~~~
I don't think Loublaze can be considered everyone.

155~~~
So people think he is out of his depth after TWO games in Scotland? 

Fack me the standards are high.

156~~~
7, plus 12 here, 8 at Birmingham, 5 at Blackpool and 43 for the u21s.

157~~~
He's not better than Mcnair or even Borthwick Jackson and probably Tuanzebe anyway.

Be pointless to recall him.

158~~~
No thanks.

159~~~
Good to have him back if true.

160~~~
Yes I love having players that aren't good enough.

161~~~
perhaps he is being sent back.

162~~~
Celtic fans haven't exactly been convinced. He's had his moments but I really can't see him ever being good enough for us, or a top PL team to be honest.

163~~~
He hasn't even got in Celtic's matchday squad recently....And they are fecking awful

164~~~
He won't have a Premier League career. Defensive prowess is more critical lower down the table than the top half arguably.

165~~~
Do you?.Good for you. I'll be glad to see him back as a good squad player during the tough Christmas and New year period.

166~~~
I won't. He clearly isn't good enough. It's ok to say that players aren't good enough. It's a very small percentage of players that are good enough for top clubs. Blackett is miles from that standard.

167~~~
He's not a good squad player, that's the point.

168~~~
He is terrible. Not sure which is worse. The fact he's so bad he got subbed off after coming on as a sub or the fact he's below Boyata and Ambrose in the pecking order - both of whom are absolutely crap. 

You could maybe get away with playing him against crap like Villa at Old Trafford but other than that his future is like League 2 level (I'm being generous, it's Christmas after all).

169~~~
He wouldn't cut it in a championship team, never mind for us.

170~~~
Another one that won't make it here.

171~~~
The fact that we resort to call him back to help ease our defensive crisis is enough to sack Van Gaal if we ever needed reasoning.

172~~~
If he's brought back it will be less to do with our defensive injuries and more to do with the fact that his recent game time has been with Celtics u21 team and not the first team

173~~~
It's great to show patience towards youngsters, but he was never a player worth considering such patience. Save that towards players who actually did well for the youth teams like Adnan, Wilson, etc...

I think it's fine to say he won't make it at United, as long as the young players don't get ridiculed.

174~~~
Nowhere close to being good enough in my honest opinion.

175~~~
Only brought into the first team because he's left-footed.

176~~~
Indeed. A bizarre decision even by van Gaal standards. 

He's dreadful. We shouldn't have promoted him, we shouldn't have given him a new contract and we shouldn't be bringing him back now.

177~~~
<a class="username" data-user="45824, @Loublaze" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/45824/">@Loublaze</a> 's best Christmas present.

178~~~
He's been spoken of so badly that I'm expecting him to do this now every time he gets the ball

179~~~
Yes, get that future legend back sharpish!

180~~~
Still wondering to this day wtf he was trying to do there.

181~~~
Forrest Gump would do better than that guy

182~~~
There has been a lot of talk of signing a left back in the transfer window. I would rather bring Blackett back as cover until a decision over LVG is made. Any other manager would go for a centre back and use Blind exclusively at left back.

183~~~
I think he kinda hoped Lahm would give up chase after a few strides as that is what Fellaini himself does normally <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

184~~~
I've only watched him once this season. Him and Boyata together were comedy gold. They got completely schooled by Molde and Blackett looked like a lamb to the slaughter every time Molde were on the attack. Absolutely woeful player. If this clown gets as much as one minute for Manchester fecking United ever again then it's time to sack LVG, Giggs, Woody and even the Glazers.

Odd bump I know but is it true he hasn't played a minute of football for Celtic since November? Not really the ideal loan spell if so.

186~~~
From what i can gather he's only played 13 minutes for the senior team (cup game v Stranraer) since November. He's since been playing in the Celtic U20 development squad.

He clearly has no future at United.

Since halloween!

Edit: Oh, didn't see the cup game. Still...

188~~~
That's a shame. Hard to see where he goes from here. Maybe a starter in the next defence Roberto Martinez is manager of, I suppose.

189~~~
Don't think he'll be playing first division football anytime soon.

190~~~
He'll do well to make it at any PL club.

191~~~
He should head down to a good League One club, get some experience and then fight his way back to The Premier League like Drinkwater has. 

Keane at Burnley is making his way back to the big time also.

192~~~
Won't do him any harm.. Also gotta lay off the weights if he wants to develop any sort of football ability.

193~~~
The difference is Keane and Drinkwater are actual good footballers. Blackett will go down to League One and never be seen again. He'll be lucky to ever play in the Championship again.

194~~~
Agreed.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Genuinely is fecking shite. I'd rather give Sadiq a game. Of all the mad shit van Gaal did, Blackett has to be at the top.

197~~~
Did he even play a game for Celtic? 

I heard he looked awful in the Scottish league. He wouldn't get in championship teams.

198~~~
If he's as bad as everyone here says...then why did LVG give him 12 appearances? Surely he must have some ability

199~~~
Yes, the ability to use his left foot.
