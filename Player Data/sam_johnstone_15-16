1~~~
Always liked Sam Johnstone and I think he and Joel Pereira are top goalkeeping talents. I thought he played very well last night, and would have no issue with him being our number 2 keeper next season. 

He was reportedly excellent at Doncaster last season too.

2~~~
I liked his decisiveness in the game last night and his handling was confident, I'd not be opposed to him getting the back up spot this season over the sloth from Argentina we seem to be getting to replace Valdes.

3~~~
Senses danger very early, and showed a lot of confidence as well.

4~~~
I thought he had a solid game last night against tricky opponents. I'd like to see how he does on this tour and if he performs like he did this morning, then he should be given a chance. He looked far better than Lindegaard that's for sure.

5~~~
Thought he was good last night, got off his line early and often and judged them all perfectly. Spared the blushes of both Darmian and Carrick, the latter just 10 seconds in to the game.

6~~~
He made Lindegaard look like a reserve team u16 player.

7~~~
Needs to practice his kicking out. Still comfortably better than Lindergaard's though.

8~~~
I agree. He was so alert yesterday. I just wish we hold off the Romero signing for now and see how Johnstone does on tour or maybe Lindegaard will be sold and we'll go with De Gea, Romero + Johnstone as our 3 goalkeepers.

9~~~
Sign Romero and send him out on loan. He isn't going to get better fecking around on the bench.

10~~~
Keepers get their chances and make their names in injury crises'. When the first choice is injured would be better if he were on the bench rather than on loan. If he is any lower than second choice though,  I'd agree with a loan.

11~~~
Put in a clause that we can call him back then.

12~~~

13~~~
Is that even possible anymore except Youth Loans?

Plus i think he will need registering in the 25 Man squad from now.

14~~~
I think he's quality. Good enough to be our number two.

15~~~
Very impressed with him last night. Read the game well and was quick off his line every time he sensed danger. Definitely a keeper to watch out for!

16~~~

17~~~
this anti lindegaard agenda is really funny <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Johnstone shown more yesterday though

18~~~
So basically no agenda?

19~~~
He was apparently excellent at Doncaster first half and then at Preston too in the 2nd half of the season.

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>PNE still waiting on Johnstone</b></span>

20~~~
Played very well and sweeped up well which i didnt think he had in him. His feet wasnt bad either!

21~~~
I like him. Like a little prodigy of Hoek, think I'd rather him around for a year.

22~~~
Didn't see the game but very pleased to hear he did well.

23~~~
I'm really poor at judging goal keeping talents for the most part. I guess I can identify quality sometimes since I knew from an early stage of Lloris' career he'd be class but in general I'm not sure.

24~~~
I liked what I saw of him.

25~~~
He did his chances no harm at all, very quick and positive when coming off his line to deal with any danger. Watched him a couple of times at Preston last season, he does look a decent goalkeeping talent.

26~~~
Even though the attention was on our new signings yesterday, I couldn't help myself being quite excited about his performance. His reading of the game and his bravery really stood out. It's good to see a young keeper come off his line and take charge of the situation. You'd hope that would impress LVG and Hoek too.

I'd like to see him as our no. 2 next season and get a good run of cup games.

27~~~
If we end up with Romero and cillesen as our two senior keepers it would be worth his while sticking around because I think he would have a good chance of getting in the side ahead of both of those at some point in the season.

28~~~
I think he's promising as well but playing every game on loan would be far better than sticking round here on the bench all season.

29~~~
liked the look of him against club america, not afraid to come off his line.

I wouldn't be against loaning him out again to preston for first team experience in the championship though, as he won't get regular game time for the first team instantly.

30~~~
His kicking and passing need some work, but he has the goalkeeping on point. His decision-making, speed of thought, and reading of the situations is amazing, and we know about his reflexes as well.

31~~~
I like him too but he should go out on loan to Preston and gain that much needed experience at a higher level. Maybe he can do a Hart.

32~~~
A championship loan would seem the logical move.
Will milinkovich be in the UK this year as well... Some young keeper talent we have

33~~~
Sign romero as de gea's back up. Lindegaard is happy to be number 3 anyway.

Sam needs to go out on loan again. No point of keeping him here even as a number 2. At his age it is better for him to play.

34~~~
I'd rather we kept him and had him as the #2 choice battling for the main gig. We are going to get to the point where we cannot keep loaning him out all the time and need to make a definitive decision on him one way or another.

35~~~
Would love it for one of our local lads to be #2 keeper.

I'd keep him this season, give him the cup games.

36~~~
Following the Joe Hart trajectory, he it would be great if he had a PL loan this season, one in which he was first-choice. Then, like Hart, he can return to Manchester ready to be first-choice, once De Gea leaves.

37~~~
Sam was impressive in his last game,loan move would sensible.Who knows,he might be our first choice next season.

38~~~
so he is going to play full 90 mins by the coming game.  i wish he fully understands what does it mean.  good luck boy

39~~~
Me too.

I always wonder when is the right age to get a homegrown goalkeeper to be part of the main squad. We just can't keep loaning him forever after all.

40~~~
love this pic

41~~~
if he went to championship club for loan and played 50 games I would be happy for him but if there is a chance deGea leaves this summer I would keep him around the team and let him fight eventually for the starting spot, he can surely be better than Romero or Lindegaard very soon.

42~~~
When was the last time we had a youth GK that went on to establish himself as the 1st team GK? Ben Forster had the potential but was weak mentally.

43~~~
We bought Foster, he wasn't a youth product nor that young when he broke through. Probably going back to the 80's or 70's for a young keeper as can't think of any.
We have recently brought in someone superb young keeping prospects, maybe in another 7 or 8 years they may establish themselves <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

44~~~
Ben Foster is not a product of our youth academy

45~~~
Tom Heaton has probably come the closest to getting to the 1st team in the recent past

46~~~
You have to go before the Fergie era to find one.Historically we're quite bad at producing goalkeepers compared to other positions.Must be incredible to finally see one.

47~~~
I thought he passed the ball very well today, which surprised me. Also, as vs Club America, quick off his line sniffing out danger.

48~~~
He seems comfortable with the ball at his feet and reacts quickly, I like him.

49~~~
Hopefully we have a Courtois-ish plan for him.

50~~~
IMO, it seems that for a young GK to break through they have to be at the right place at the right time.  Either be significantly better than other GKs when at a smaller club, or be at a big club and the right sequence of injuries allows them to grab the position and not let go.

51~~~
I didn't like how it him forever to kick the ball out of bounds when he had a fast paced striker coming at him. Needs to deal with those types of situations better.

52~~~
wtf? he was making over 100passes per game which is a lot and dealt very well with them yet you pinpoint one situation when he could do a little better but it wasn't that bad at all. DeGea puts himself under pressure also at times and I don't think he had to deal with so many back passes and such horrible pitch

53~~~
He was thinking too much were to place it, a split second mor could have been a really dangerous situation.  He is a good keep an obviously talented but I thought he could have realised the ball a lot sooner than he did there. Just a small observation.

54~~~

55~~~

56~~~
I hope he's not sold, he's going to be England #1 sooner or later

57~~~
Should be our 2nd choice this season.

58~~~
dunno how he can match DDG's reflexes but his much more all round goalkeeper than deGea was at this age. He can be a bit like Neuer sweeping around, he's got big stature too and is not afraid of to go for crosses, good thrower of the ball and decent with his feet.. His biggest asset is positioning and reading of the game I'd say that alone makes me feel he will be a great goalie.

Hope he gets a proper chance if DDG goes, certainly doing his best to impress our manager.. I also think if DDG stays for one last season and then go for free, we should keep him around and ease him into first team at some lesser games as DeGea will be gone anyway so game time for the future players..

59~~~
He kinda reminds me of Nigel Martyn

60~~~
I like him. Minimally, he looks capable of becoming our future no.2 keeper, hopefully more.

61~~~

62~~~
He will be van Gaals English van der Sar <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

63~~~
I'll genuinely be thrilled if we put our faith in Johnstone if DDG ends up leaving this Summer. Romero as back up.

64~~~
Agreed.

65~~~
Would be nice to bring another English lad through

66~~~
Ideal scenario: keep DDG this season (looks increasingly likely) and make Johnstone our #2 keeper. Then when De Gea pisses off next summer, promote Johnstone to the #1 spot.

Ok, the <i>ideal</i> scenario is to win the Champions League this season and just keep De Gea. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/><img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

67~~~
I would love if retain De Gea this year, have Johnstone develop further during the year and then make him our no. 1 next season. Nothing like a home grown GK going on to become a club great. Of course he will have to go on loan this year and prove himself first.

68~~~
I wouldn't be surprised if we Lindegaard go and keep Johnstone on as the #2. The next 2 weeks will decide that, Van Gaal clearly gives a lot of importance to training performances from players as well and this'll be Johnstone's best chance to get a foot in the first team door

69~~~
He was very good. A little shaky understandably but good shot stopping decent coming off the line and reactions too. Could do nothing for the goal.

I hope he goes on loan abroad to a club with Europa or UCL. Instead of wasting a year in PNE in league one. If he is to be our #1 then he needs more experience than league one

70~~~
Championship but I agree with your point.Wish we had a quality partnership club like Chelsea has with Vitesse.

71~~~
Johnstone has very good potential. The more I seen him, the more I convinced that he will better off if we loan him out to a good club if DDG stick around this season. All of his current weaknesses can be easily taken care with more playing experiences.

The only concern i got is whether Johnstone will got the same weak mentality as Ben Foster. But I suppose that can only be found out after we played him regularly in our first team.

72~~~
How tall is he?

73~~~
According to Wikipedia, 1.91m (or 6ft 3in)

74~~~
I agree with the point as well but Vitesse are hardly a good example. They haven't got European football in over 10 years and are unlikely to get it this season either. The Eredivisie isn't exactly a great league either, although the defence there is so shite that he'd be tested quite a bit.

75~~~
I'm good with either scenario.  The Romero signing has me thinking that he will go back to PNE on loan and I think a season in the Championship would be better than a season on our bench.  To my eye Johnstone looks better than any of the youth GKs we have let go recently and many of those players have carved out decent careers.

76~~~
agree.

perhaps he will be loaned out if DDG stays the year.

77~~~
Another decent outing for him, I really hope we consider giving him more games this season instead of Romero and Lingaard.

78~~~
I hope we send him out on loan though.Cortouis didn't make it by playing second fiddle to Cech.It's unlikely for him to make it as a number 1 but we should try to maximize his chance.

79~~~
Not sure what games others have been watching but he's looked like a young Gk that won't amount to much to me. (Edit - to clarify I meant for us - He may well have a decent career at a championship or low-mid table prem team or career backup at a better team). Tentative coming out, not confident on the ball. Young keepers like him are a dime a dozen among top flight clubs and if he played for liverpool there wouldn't be a soul suggesting he will be england's #1 sooner or later. I'm sure he'll have a fine career by most standards but first choice for a top club, let alone england? Nah.

80~~~
This. Looks like DDG, Romero and Anders are going to be our keepers this season. With two of them leaving next summer, Johnstone will be in with a better shout after a season of competitive football.

81~~~
I don't think he is tentative at all. He seems quite confident in fact. There was a moment he came out to get the ball and played like a DM for a good 10 seconds. Shot stopping wise he seems good too. 

Sorry but missed this. And Yeah championship. By the way didn't we have some kind of a similar deal with a Belgian club?

82~~~
K.A.A Gent but that didn't come off.

83~~~
<span style="font-size: 15px">Sam Johnstone is set to complete a season-long loan move to Preston North End following the end of the club’s tour of the United States.</span>
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/transfers/11772280/Man-Utd-transfer-news-Sam-Johnstone-to-complete-Preston-North-End-loan-move.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...-to-complete-Preston-North-End-loan-move.html</a>

84~~~
He seemed very confident throughout the whole tour, his sweeping was almost Neuer-esque much better doing that than Big Dave, it's complete opposite what you said. Also very good on the ball, long kicking finding fellaini easily and short passing very confident, didn't get us into trouble like Dave last game. He may only misjudged one ball played behind our defense but when you have Jones and Blind pushing forward, you have to be quick off the line which he did brilliantly.

He's big young prospect, shame his refelxes weren't tested more. His shot stopping is usually very good due to his great positioning. Loan move to PNE will do him very good , he will come really experienced to fight for the no1 spot or rotation option

85~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The hyperbole here is ridiculous. 

I missed the first two pre season games. Perhaps I missed two epic performances. I wasn't really that impressed with him against Barca or psg. Johnstone is 22 years old. Not 18. To put it in perspective, courtois just barely turned 23. De Gea will turn 25 later this year. If johnstone was as good as some are making out on here he wouldn't be playing at PNE...

He will have a career similar to Ben foster, at best based on what I've seen.

86~~~
GKs have much longer careers, 2-3 years don't matter that much. To me he outshone DDG during the preseason - he will make it, I'm pretty confident. A year at PNE will be very good for him - he will get tested a lot in the Championship. It will be very good for his development.

87~~~
if you missed the first two games than why don't you shut up?<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

he's got already two successful loans and he will have another in championship  I am sure of that, he's highly rated there, league 1 and championship are not La liga but they are tough leagues for sure, so the keeper doesn't need to get used to premier league for 2 years like deGea who was average to decent in his first two years.. I am confident he will become better than Ben Foster

88~~~
One of the few positives from the tour. He's actually better off his line then DDG.

89~~~
For about ten minutes last night I actually was actually quite excited about him. He seemed confident and his distribution at one point was class. Then Darmian had to save his ass twice as he completely misjudged things and got caught in no mans lands and for me that made it pretty clear to see he isn't ready to be our number 1.

Overall he has had a good tour and have been impressed but at times last night I was starting to worry for him.

90~~~
Aye, it will be. I'm just not quite so bullish. By 22 hart was starting for city and had made his full england debut. I hope he turns out brilliant for our sake and England's. Just don't think it'll happen. As I said - I see a Ben Foster trajectory at best.

If you can't handle primary school level English <i><b>than </b></i>why don't you stop posting? See how easy it is to be a dick?

I admitted I didn't see the first two games to make clear that some other folks clearly have seen more than me and are thus likely better qualified to judge his ability. My point is that based on what I HAVE seen, he's never going to be first choice for us, or England, barring a serious dearth of talent for both teams. It's my opinion based on the ~90 minutes I have seen of him this summer and the clubs he's featured for so far.

91~~~
very legit to make opinion based on 90 odd minutes.. as for the typo, do you really mean it? I bet you can speak as good French and Spanish as me let alone my native language Czech.. so piss off mr. grammar

92~~~
A typo is mistyping. Not understanding the difference between than and then is something else. If it was truly a (very convenient) typo then you've either got some fat fingers or you're severely lacking dexterity. It's easy to be a dick over something trivial and if you're going to be a dick you probably shouldn't look like a fool doing it.

Anyway, have you seen any of his games on loan or just this pre season? If the latter then you've seen ~270 minutes. At which point between 90 and 270 minutes is one's opinion legitimized? Please enlighten as to your arbitrary cut off for when my opinion can begin to matter.

Furthermore, my opinion is also based on where he's been loaned to, as I stated and you conveniently ignored. Truly elite keepers are usually identified and playing for top clubs, or at least top flight clubs, by the time they're that age. Take courtois, de gea, or even hart. This lad's been playing league 1 football.

Buena noche.

93~~~
Who's the last GK that came from the academy and established himself in the first team?Can't recall any with my limited knowledge about United history.Jimmy Rimmer came through the academy but was never first choice.

94~~~
Tom Heaton was probably the closest I can remember in the recent past as someone who came close being a first teamer I guess.

I know its impossible to predict who might or might not make it but he's probably the best GK prospect we've had come through in quite a while. I saw a few of his games for Preston, and he's very good 1v1, great reflexes and would make a good sweeper keeper. Doesn't mean he's ready to be our #1 but I think he's better than Lindegaard atleast.

he has a lot of potential, and will improve a lot over the coming season as he plays regularly for Preston. Too early to write him off, that too based on pre-season tour games

95~~~
I'm sure there's nobody within the Fergie era.Was thinking more in the 70-80s but can't claim I have heard about many players on that era.

96~~~
Gary Bailey in the 1980s was the only established first choice keeper I can remember that came through our youth ranks.

97~~~
I won't pretend that I know much about a player that played for us before I was born but according to Wikipedia he came to United when he's 20 so not from our academy.

98~~~
Ah my mistake then! He was before my time as well but I seemed to recall Hughes was our last striker and Bailey our last goalkeeper but apparently I got that wrong.

99~~~
Gary Walsh was for a bit

100~~~
PNE just loaned in Sunderland and England U20s GK Jordan Pickford.No Sam for them then.

101~~~

102~~~
what now?

103~~~
Should have a thread called "Our goalkeeping is a mess".

104~~~
So we have five first team goalkeepers. One is a new signing and the other four have completely unclear futures. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

105~~~
I'm sure they'll be plenty of teams that will want him on loan. He was getting rave reviews at Preston last season iirc.

106~~~
Indeed. If we want to loan him, I'm sure we'll have no shortage of suitors.

107~~~

108~~~
feck yeah

109~~~
I don't see why that is a problem? We just brought in Romero who you would assume will be second choice. Valdez and Lindegaard will llikely leave, and DDG or a replacement for him will be our starter. It wouldn't make much sense to keep Johnstone here if he wasn't going to see any first team action, surely it would be better for his career to loan him out and start every game for a championship team than to play with the u21 team here.

110~~~
I think the DDG situation is leaving us in a mess.. We should just let him go, try to sign someone like Lloris and allow Sam to go out on loan.

111~~~
then would rather he stayed

112~~~
Why? Johnstone would still be third choice and mostly playing for our u21's. You may not like who we end up bringing in to be our new number one but that won't change Johnstone's place in the squad this season.

113~~~
Yeah, don't really see how our GK problems have "worsened" with that news. I highly doubt he was going to be an integral part of the squad this season, especially after signing Romero.

114~~~
It fits the media's narrative of us as a "club in crisis" at the moment... first ADM, then DDG. We are going to be losing 2 world class players in this window. As if it's not enough a blow to be losing our 1st GK, our 3rd GK also demands to leave if he's not going to start.

115~~~
Would rather play Johnstone then sign Cillessen tbh.

116~~~
Storm in a teacup as far as the "crisis" line in the media goes.

Obviously sad if true, because he's shown himself to be a solid goalkeeper, and especially surprising for me was that he was so good coming off his line, which is perhaps something Hoek and the staff at United have them all working on now. 

I wouldn't have complained if he'd have been our Number 2, but now that's obviously not the case, I wish him the best wherever he goes next, since he'd certainly be one of the better goalkeepers in the Championship. Certainly has a bright future ahead of him, and would not be a surprise at all to see him eventually join the long line of United youth products who have played in the Prem.

117~~~
He should leave for his own development to be fair, goalkeepers leaving us have tended to have decent careers...apart from poor Roy Carroll of course <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

118~~~
He wants to be loaned not sold.

119~~~
Given pre-season, and him playing the most minutes as a keeper, I wouldnt be surprised to see him start tomorrow ahead of Romero...

120~~~
I want to see him start. 

Anders played 30 minutes in preseason. Romero is new and doesn't speak English. I really hope Sam is given a chance.

121~~~
I actually hope he starts ahead of Lindergaard and Romero tbh.

Unless Valdes has sorted things out.

122~~~
Don't see Lindegaard or Romero starting due to not having played for us in pre-season at all (match rhythm and all that) and LVG has said Valdes will leave so surely he is in the same boat as De Gea.  Johnstone could well start tomorrow.

123~~~
If Ben Amos could go through a PL match (vs. Stoke) with a clean sheet I have no worries about Sam.Spurs wouldn't be at their best with their pre-season schedule.

124~~~
I hope Sam does start tomorrow. Think he really could come good for us long term.

125~~~
Come on Sam, this could be your moment! Hope he starts and has a cracking game.

126~~~
Would love to see him start. He'll have a lot to prove.

127~~~
I'd love to see him play tomorrow. Would be fantastic for him and a huge confidence boost.

128~~~
From his wiki site.

"On 25 May 2015, Johnstone kept a clean sheet in the <a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Football_League_One_play-off_Final" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">League One play-off Final</a> as Preston won promotion to the <a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015-16_Football_League_Championship" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Championship</a> with a 4–0 win over <a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swindon_Town_F.C." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Swindon Town</a> at <a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wembley Stadium</a>.<a class="externalLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Johnstone#cite_note-18" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">[18]</a>"

He's 22, if he's gonna step up to be a top keeper, why not now? He's represented England youth at multiple levels so he has got what it takes technically it would seem. We should find out if he has it mentally. I say start him against Spurs.

129~~~
Really hope he is given a chance tomorrow, but more likely to be Romero.

130~~~
Preston fans rated him highly too.

131~~~
De Gea mentally impaired
Romero not ready
Valdes and LVG break up
Lindegaard being sold

House of Johnstone

132~~~
I think he will start tomorrow. Valdes is out of favor and Romero has only been training for 2 week max and played no minutes this season. Sam should do well, he looked good in preseason.

This will be a big chance for him, hopefully he will take it!

133~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

134~~~
Yeah, would be great if he started and had a good game, and keep a place in the side. I don't know much about Johnstone but what I have seen so far has looked pretty solid. I also thought the same about Ben Foster back in 2009, but the pressure of playing for a club of this size as the #1 totally crushed him. I'd be hoping Johnstone is made of tougher stuff.

135~~~
That was a bit shit to be fair, unless I'm missing an obvious connection given I haven't watched the show. Otherwise yea, C+, do better.

136~~~
Cmon Sammy boy, make us proud. Keep Romero out of goal please.

137~~~
I have faith in him tomorrow, and beyond. The only question is this new trend that has swept through our squad of our defensive players being overlooked due to not having the touch of Zidane. As a last-line of defence, I have every faith.

138~~~
I've literally only just realised, if you were saying his surname as a possessive, he is John Stones...

It's a sign!

139~~~
I'm expecting Sam Johnstone to start as well, especially considering how important match fitness is to Van Gaal, I doubt Romero is at that level.

140~~~
you might very well think that, I couldn't possibly agree<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

141~~~
Í've got a very good feeling about this lad doing really well for us.
Hopfully he'll keep DDG on the bench througt the whole season.. Now that would be shhweet!

142~~~
I'd love it if he was given a chance, he may not be as talented as De Gea but he's got all the attributes to develop into a very good goalkeeper. You never know, he may even be considered one of the best in the world one day.

143~~~
Why would we play keeper like Romero who most likely cant speak English - would struggle coordinating defense, is new to the league and to his teammates and in fact just arrived and didn't feature a game for us? Let alone handling crosses from trippier, Erricksen and Kane on headers.. This would be a hug risk by Van Gaal but strange things had happen under his management so I wouldn't be that surprised.

Other options are - out of favor Valdes who played for reserves, struggled in his first game and would struggle another. He's shit goalkeeper who didn't have a club for year or so and was injured, he would be even a worse option than Romero IMO, really don't rate him and Van Gaal probably took him back to get more money for him when we eventually sell him.

Lindegaard didn't feature at all last three seasons, he's decent goalie but it is clear that Johnstone is now ahead of him as he got more gametime in preseason and showed great potential.

Johsntone has more experience with English football than the three altogether I guess. Let's put him in cage and see what happens. It might be his lifetime chance. It's also a home game and he's our player he will be motivated even more rather than nervous I feel.

144~~~
Never going to be a long term solution but I've seen nothing in the friendlies and his appearances for loan clubs to make me think he's a calamity or likely to cause us unnecessary worry, if he does indeed play (as he should). 

Looks a solid shot stopper, confident in the air and surprisingly good at coming off his line to claim stray passes. To be honest, he'll probably be better able to deal with the rough-and-tumble of the Premier League - which De Gea and countless other foreign goalies have struggled with - than Romero would anyway, considering his experience in the lower leagues. I suppose we just have to remember that he is a young lad, and as solid as he has looked, he is no De Gea and we can't expect the game-winning heroics we've become accustomed to from our goalie!

145~~~
Great save of Johnstone's, cleared by John Stones. Old Trafford cheer the defensive effort.

Never say never.

146~~~
I for one am excited about this lad possibly being fast-tracked. He's a terrific young keeper and would be amazing if he could keep DDG out of the team. At least we know he won't piss off to somewhere sunny at the first opportunity.

147~~~
This.Even if he's ever going to be that "game-winning heroic" it will need times.

148~~~
I think Johnstone would be better at dealing with the physicality of the PL than Romero. Romero will need time to adjust to the league, and dealing with crosses and corners in a crowded penalty box

149~~~
He'll start, drop an early clanger that will go unpunished and then proceed to have a stormer.

150~~~
I'll take that.

151~~~
Would rather he started than anyone not called David.

152~~~
I really hope he gets the nod tomorrow, I like the look of him.

153~~~
Hope he gets the nod ahead of Romero and plays well.

154~~~
I'm pretty sure he will. Even with goalies, Van Gaal appears to consider match fitness above all.

155~~~
Other than preseason hasnt seen much of him. 

Does he have a shot of becoming a good keeper?

156~~~
He look young, solid and confident and I really like that. Too good to be true though if he will make it here, but let's hope he take his chance well.

157~~~
I'm surprised given all the reasons for not wanting Romero to play that people are overlooking his two mistakes last week against PSG.

It can be hard to tell with goalkeepers but for me last week showed I don't think he is quite ready. He would have cost us two goals if it wasn't for Darmian.

158~~~
I hope he gets the nod tomorrow. Would be lovely to see us give a promising goalkeeper from our own ranks a chance.

159~~~
Well, he certainly wouldn't be any worse than DDG was for us when he started...he was pretty rough if I remember rightly...but in the main Fergie kept with him. So I reckon we don't have much to lose by pushing him on.

160~~~
He's no more of a risk than Romero and has played in pre season, might as well start him tomorrow.

161~~~
I'd gamble on him. Would be great to have a home grown #1.

162~~~
Really hope he starts tomorrow. I think he's earned it and looked solid, if unspectacular on tour.

And I'd much rather have a keeper like that then a mentalist like Romero

163~~~
If he does start tomorrow then there wasn't much point in signing Romero so as much as I would like to see Johnstone start I just can't see it.

164~~~
which mistakes?

165~~~
Not buying into all this hysteria about Romero, but I would love to see Johnstone start. Really feels like we might be on the threshold of a genuine period of youth promotion.

166~~~
Not ready yet to play in this side at the highest level, can't kick or control the ball well enough which will potentially lead to a big mistake at this point especially with the style of football we play under LVG.

167~~~
I'd start him over Romero tomorrow. Had a solid pre season, in my opinion.

168~~~
We should play him IMO. He's had match practice in pre-season, was decent, showed potential and looks promising. Also, other options are not a clear upgrade on him either with Valdes out of club and De Gea not being played. Lindegaard, for me, never looked solid in any games he played eevn in the season when De Gea was in and out of the team. Romero didn't have any preseason and according to LvG philosophy, should not be playing tomorrow.

169~~~
I would love this guy to start, I really do rate him and playing him will give him a load of confidence even if he is nervy to begin with.

170~~~
The only reason he starts is if Romero's English is so bad that he can't realistically communicate with our back 4 yet in such a high-profile game. If he can communicate with them to a reasonable extent then he starts, not Johnstone.

171~~~
Did you not watch the game?

172~~~
According to Ian Ladyman (mail) he will start against Tottenham. He looked lively during pre season.

173~~~
Johnston will start and deserves to after a cracking pre season. I missed the press conference earlier but I'm led to believe lvg said that Romero is unavailable due to lacking "match rhythm" I also thought that the fact that both valdes and romero didn't get numbered today was a dead give away seeing as everyone else did.

174~~~
yeah I did, he did only one mistake throughout the whole tour and that was missing the ball when coming out from the goal. The second reasonable goalie mistake was DDG's in the first half, kicking the ball straight to opponent on the ground IIRC

175~~~
What about his fitness? He hasn't had a pre-season. I'd play the kid

176~~~
I really hope he starts. There's really no way of telling how good a keeper is unless you seem them play over a good number of games.

177~~~
I agree, which mistakes are we talking about?

178~~~
also no experience in English football and more importantly no games under his belt with team mates. Shouldn't throw him into the game when he just arrived. Johntone's much less of a risk and like Lingard and Blackett were given chance last year, this time it should be him who gets the chance. Not someone who trained with the team for a week..

179~~~
He should be given a shot for sure. Romero should get his chance in the cup games.

180~~~
If you have a look on Youtube at the game and go to 64 minutes you will see the first one which I might be being slightly harsh and would have forgotten about bar is not for the second one. Clearly though slightly naive getting caught off his line and if not for Blind clearing it after the PSG players lobbed him it would have been a goal.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mUSEfEgMCqc?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

The second one if you go to 70 minutes is the one that worries me more. Everybody here is saying how good he is off his line but he comes charging out and ends up in no mans land again takes a wild swipe at it getting nowhere near it, PSG player takes the ball past him and if not for the defender it's goal. This was from a long ball from the back simple stuff.

Goalkeeping is an unforgiving position, a mistake leads to a goal so we really can't afford to have goalkeepers who are still learning their trade.

181~~~
I don't think fitness with goalkeepers is so much a problem as sharpness and "match-rhythm" so I guess it comes down to what LVG has seen in training. However if English is not a serious problem I would expect Romero to get the nod.  

Unless the conditions I mentioned above are not in Romero's favor I really don't see LVG having much of an issue throwing in an International keeper who has recently played in a world cup final into his first premier league game.

182~~~
The second one was because of the pitch. The ball would always slow up and hang on the bounce and the keepers and defenders from both sides were continuously getting caught out by it. It isn't a fair criticism at all as he can't be expected to perfectly read bounces on a shit pitch and no pitch in the Premier League will be like that was.

He has to come out on the first one too as if he stays on his line Cavani can take the turn and he is screwed. Its not an ideal situation to be in but the defenders shouldn't have left two players free in the box like that in the first place. The tracking of runs there was frankly embarrassing.

183~~~
I think it's fair criticism. He can blame the pitch but if a goalkeeper isn't 110% sure he's getting it he shouldn't be coming that far out leaving himself in no mans land. Surely proffesional footballers have the ability to adjust to a pitch?

I was impressed with him overall I just see mistakes in him which shouldn't be something we are happy to settle for.

184~~~
DDG wasn't exactly 'mistake free' in his first season was he?
We have to trust the manager to do what's right, and pick who he thinks is most up for it.
however, personally from what I saw in the pre season, I belive Sam Johnstone impressed. And certainly didn't look 'out of place'.
Whats more, there's no better place to learn than in the 'deep end'!

185~~~
Couldn't agree more.

"Sweeper goalies" are bound to make mistakes here and there because it's risky. Look at Neuer's blunder in the DFL Super Cup. It was very similar to Sam's mistake against PSG. Lloris also. 

It's a risky approach from a goalie but sometimes you need it, especially teams with a high defensive line.

186~~~
God I would love to see us give Johnstone a real go and for him to become the real deal.
It would be the perfect tonic to the bitterness of how things are ending with De Gea.

I can picture it now... Champions League Final - Cork 2017.
All square after 120 minutes, all square after 9 penalties apiece.

<i>"and it's the goalkeeper De Gea who steps up, he looks nervous.. or confident... or just gormless. He strikes it to the left...
...and JOHNSTONE!!! What a save that is! A miraculous stop from the young keeper!

Manchester United become the first team to retain the Champions League and the scenes are incredible here Geoff, the Spanish keeper is inconsolable down on the pitch. The United players have lifted their keeper up and are parading him around the field.."</i>

I can't wait.

187~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

188~~~
The 64th minute isn't fair criticism at all. It isn't even close to a "mistake". The 70th minute incident is poor communication between him and Darmian. Hard to know who to blame there, without knowing whethere there was a call or not. 

The fact that we have to get to this level of nit-picking to find a single possible error from his whole pre-season speaks volumes about how assured his actual performances were. DDG has made a whole heap of errors in his United career so far. Last season really stood out as being far more error free than the previous two but they were there, if you analyse his performances as closely as you're analysing Johnstone's.

189~~~
Until now I'd always had Johnstone down as one of those way too good to release yet not quite up to a starting place so I guess the day has arrived when all the talk about his potential to make the first team can stop.

I wouldn't deny that I have a slight concern as to whether he can properly handle the glare of such a prominent fixture as a seasons opener at home given the expectation on the team as a whole. This remains a defence, bar Darmian, that over worked De Gea last season - and the one before. Johnstone is a kid in goalkeeping terms and we can't expect him to be up to bailing us out time and again in matches in the way DeGea did. In youth football for a keeper you're generally kept more occupied as it's more basketball style football in there being less possession and seemingly more even attacks. As with all keepers eyes at the very top clubs - and especially one where possession appears everything - he has to develop the mindset whereby he could spend vast chunks of the game a spectator but then very called upon to make a game changing save.

Really wish him all the luck in the world and as others have said how great would it be to see one of our own establish himself as first team keeper.

190~~~
I don't want to go overboard, as I've seen little of him, but he was extremely impressive on tour and by all accounts is a talented young keeper. Does anyone believe he could have a career trajectory akin to Joe Hart where he's introduced to the Premier League fold and takes it by storm like Hart did at Birmingham all those years ago?

I think it's probably the romantic in me, as I'd love to see a homegrown #1 between the sticks, even though the chances are unlikely.

191~~~
He's been mainly playing senior football for the last few years. You're right that playing for United is a different ball-game, mainly because the keeper is so rarely involved and needs to keep their focus while hardly ever touching the ball. Which is tricky. Of course, if our defence is as ropey as you imply he should feel right at home!

192~~~
Indeed, before the De Gea situation yesterday Johnstone was being praised by many during his preseason games, now some are looking for mistakes or errors to justify that big stick they need to beat our "un-favoured" players with. I think you're being very generious by saying its nit-picking, I’d say those looking for reasons to justify their criticisms are pathetic, we haven’t even kicked a ball in anger yet FFS <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

If Johnstone does start today, I hope for his sake he has a fantastic game, otherwise his error will be brought up time and time again on the Caf.

193~~~
If he does play you have to say the best scenario would be for us to win 1-0 and him to see plenty of the ball and make a couple of heroic saves. His confidence and that of his teammates in him would soar and one match could suddenly become career defining.

194~~~
Who was our last homegrown keeper to 'make it' ? I might have missed a really obvious one but I have to go back to Gary Bailey. We've had a fair few poor ones who briefly flirted with the first team. Anyone remember the calamitous Paddy Roche ? It's unthinkable that the modern day monster United are now had such a poor keeper on their books in those days.

195~~~
Zeiler is probably the best keeper to come through our academy recently. Before then you'd have to go back a very long time to find a United trained keeper of real quality. I'd actually struggle to name any names.

196~~~
Foster maybe. He sort of came through although I know we paid a fee for him. Even then he never made it here although you have to say he has carved a top career elsewhere.

197~~~
He cost a million quid, went out on loan to play senior football as soon as we signed him and went straight into our first team after that. Never played for our academy and was 22 when we signed him. Don't think we can consider him homegrown.

198~~~
I suppose what I meant was that he was unknown in top flight terms prior to his time with us. We can't really claim yo have schooled him from boy to man but his career effectively took off from his time with us. But you're right not homegrown.

199~~~
I'm just being pedantic tbf. It's true we hardly ever produce any top keepers from our academy, so the odds are against Sam. Although the same is probably true of almost every other PL club.

200~~~
Gary Walsh

201~~~
Hope he gets the nod and hope he does well. Just hope the reaction on here isn't over the top if he doesn't.

202~~~
It may be better to start with Jones and Smalling if he starts..to give some extra protection..one good save early on will calm him down..

203~~~
We are better equipped squad wise with Bastian, Carrick and Morgan to shield the defence than the last few seasons.

204~~~
Big rumors that he's starting today. Delighted for him if true, and what a show of trust by LvG in him.

205~~~
Doesn't seem like the type who would get nervous. Delighted for him if he starts.

206~~~
dream has come to an end.. well perhaps now DDG's off, being no2 is much bigger opportunity too, Cup games, waiting for the mistake of No1's. Hope Romero does well tbh.

207~~~
What are you talking about? My assessment of Johnstone was the same ten minutes after the game go back and check my posts. I said he had done well in other games and then after PSG I said started well but then made a couple of mistakes. So how am I looking to justify my criticisms?

208~~~
Was I talking about you? Did I mention your name?

209~~~
I was talking about the 70th minute as fair criticism not the one in the 64th. I said regarding that I was being harsh but it was still slightly naive getting caught out like that. We can all make excuses and give reasons but the end result is the same if it costs us two goals. 

It's not really a high level of nit-picking he had very very little to do against PSG in the second half yet made at least one unforced error which could have cost us a goal. But i'd agree his performances were good over all. Unfortunately for a goalkeeper you need to be consistent not have 3 good games then potentially costs us in the 4th. I'm not going to compare DDG to Johnstone it's silly but as I said United can't afford to have goalkeeper still learning their trade. DDG was an exception as he had shown world class shot stopping ability in Spain.

210~~~
Well I am the only one here to point out he made two errors. Pogue says I am nit picking and you say that nit picking is generous so yes I assume you are talking about me? You quoted his post in response to mine by saying people are just trying to slate him, I haven't seen anybody else point out the errors?

Anybody moving on as I normally agree with your posts and understand how in these days of extreme negativity in the CAF my posts could come across like that but far from it. I like Johnstone just have my reservations on him being good enough. 

Anyway enough i'm away to watch the game.

211~~~
Shame he's not starting today.

212~~~
In this thread maybe, but there are many other threads where posters are having meltdowns.

213~~~
He had a very good preseason, hopefully he gets a chance at some point.

214~~~
I wish he would be given more opportunities. A giant of lad and one that looks more reassuring than Romero

215~~~
I wouldn't mind seeing him start for us during the carling cup games.

216~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3220084/Manchester-United-goalkeeper-Sam-Johnstone-left-furious-club-refuse-let-youngster-loan.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...t-furious-club-refuse-let-youngster-loan.html</a>

His agent is an idiot. Check out these quotes he has given the Mail:

Sam just wants to play football but Manchester United are holding him back and not even playing him.

He is a young goalkeeper and it is time for him to play regularly. If that is not at Manchester United, then it has to be elsewhere. This is an example of young English talent being held back by Van Gaal.

The start of the season was the perfect opportunity to give Sam his chance to prove he can play for United. He is ready.

If they do not want him to play then he needs to move for the sake of his career. He cannot sit on the bench or in the reserves.

England should have as many goalkeepers as possible to pick from. Given the early progress in his career that is the level he is aiming for. He is not going to get there by not playing.

217~~~
His agent is doing his job, and to be honest when the decision was made not to play DDG, Sam should have been first choice.

218~~~
Why is his agent a Idiot ?

He wants his Client to be playing instead of sitting on the bench as 3rd choice wasting time at this crucial phase of his development.

Johnstone did post a indicator on twitter that he was pissed at not being allowed to go on loan to Preston where he wanted to go, when they signed Pickford after lot of waiting. That was a good oppurtunity for him at a higher level than league 1 at a known and trusted setting.

I'd imagine he'd even be more upset now that a ordinary Romero has been starting over him. Tbf, the club and LVG are messing up his progression.

It would be tough to find a club where they wanna change the GK mid season in the championship, but hope he is allowed to go on loan when the loan window now reopens with De Gea staying. It would be a complete waste to keep him as 3rd choice.

219~~~
Exactly. If LVG was not planning on using him at the start of the season, then he should have gone on loan to Preston or another Championship club to get more game time. Playing in the reserves or sitting on his ass with the first team as 3rd choice won't do any good for his development, I'm afraid.

220~~~
For him to put the performances he did in pre-season and do it fairly well (which is basically good for a player of his stature in such a high profile situation), he must had a lot of self confidence and belief. That's what you want to see in a player, let alone a goalkeeper. Obviously maybe the agent's comment don't even represent Johnstone's but I would be more happy that he's annoyed he's not getting the chance than if he was happy to be playing the waiting game because with LVG that's not predictable or reliable at all (look at the youth inclusion in pre-season and not one appearance bar Januzaj..who's left for a year).

It was no exaggeration when people were comparing his sweeping as Neuer-esque. It was decisive and impressive (as it is when it comes off and there were a few times it didn't) and I would like to see more of this. 

As first choice keeper? Only LVG can judge that but with Romero in, it seems he really is third choice and who knows if he'll even get a game.

Still he's young so his development should in theory be safe and progressive but look at Januzaj.

221~~~
I would put him in goal before Romero no question, he is a superior keeper.

222~~~
Not sure that is a real high bar set there based on current form. Romero just looks out of his element, which is weird since I know he has played in huge games before. With DDG back (once he gets his head straight), I would absolutely love to see Johnstone get any games DDG doesn't start, assuming those are cherry picked ones v any kind of injury. If DDG was out for a few games hopefully Johnstone will have a couple games under his belt and we can make a better decision on if he is up to it.

Can't wait to see who starts against pool in a couple weeks.

223~~~
Hope he goes out on loan when the championship loan window opens. No point staying here as a third choice.

224~~~
He must already looked at his pal Butland and wonder what could have been if he was at a lesser club.

225~~~
More collateral damage from the De Gea situation. How many goalkeepers' feelings did you hurt with your wicked ways, Edurne?

226~~~
Van Gaal looked at Johnstone in pre-season and decided he's not ready to start for us but was good enough to be on the bench. Given the uncertainty over De Gea and the fact we were trying to force Lindegaard and Valdes out the club it would have been silly to let him leave and start the season with Romero as our only keeper. Now we have De Gea for the season I'm sure we will be happy to send Johnstone out on loan when the window opens next week.

That's the situation as I see it and it's perfectly normal and understandable. Van Gaal is managing his resources in the interests of United and that means players down the pecking order don't always get what they want. His agent should understand that and if he has a problem then take it up with Van Gaal himself, not launch an attack on our manager in the national press.

227~~~
Doesnt the championship loan window close much later than the normal one?Might still get that move.

228~~~
He's surely better than Romero.

229~~~

Hull looking at a loan with a view to making it permanent in the summer apparently.
I think he needs a loan at a club where he will definitely play week in week out and not just be cover. I don't really want us to sell him though.

230~~~
Gone back to Preston on loan. Jordan Pickford had been playing well for Nob End, too well actually as Sunderland recalled him.
Given the no1 shirt, and a good move all round, hopefully.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.pnefc.net/news/article/sam-johnstone-re-joins-in-loan-deal-2878548.aspx?platform=hootsuite" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.pnefc.net/news/article/s...-in-loan-deal-2878548.aspx?platform=hootsuite</a>

231~~~
What happened to pantilimon at Sunderland?

232~~~
Loss of form. Mannone picked last match.

233~~~

234~~~
Waste of a talent, thought he always looked good for us. Hope he does well though!

235~~~
agree. If DDG leaves this summer, I would be happy with Johnstone being our Number 1.

236~~~
Seriously?

237~~~
He will be the next England keeper. I have no doubt. I was impressed with him in pre-season. He has the confidence and ability. He still needs to work hard which I have no doubt he will. We will be very stupid to sell him.

238~~~
Johnstone is far from ready to play regular 1st team football for us. Needs to get more match experience in the Championship and hopefully the PL next season before we can even consider making him the #1. Too much pressure to put on him, we all saw what happened with DDG in his 1st season, and this was a GK who already had 1st team experience with Madrid for a decent amount of time as well

239~~~
Butland is the same age as Johnstone. And I rate him but Johnstone isnt anywhere close to Butland right now.

240~~~
I think he can go on to be an England international, however I dont think he'll make it here.

And I think that is the correct decision imo.

241~~~
My friend who supports PNE is claiming we're not letting them extend Sam's loan past the 28 days. Apparently we want £3m for him, we've given him a number in our Europa League squad but haven't given Valdes one. Also, we're not letting Valdes go on loan to Newcastle he reckons.

242~~~
So Johnstone is for sale?

243~~~
If clubs want him that's the fee they'd have to pay.

244~~~
Allegedly.

245~~~
what I have seen of him I like very much.

If DDG leaves, I would love for this lad to be our #1.

246~~~
This is the only Sam Johnstone discussion thread I found. No discussion in it for a year. He's 3rd choice here and, so, not likely to get matches. Should he stay or should he go?  If he goes, should it loan or permanent? I remind you all that a club can loan a goalie with a recall clause. So, from a manager's point of view, having him away on loan is as useful as him being here.

247~~~
He should be second choice IMO, he is good enough to be back up and would quite nicely fill one of the home grown spaces in the squad.

248~~~
He looked better than expected last year at the tour, made just one mistake IRC? Wouldn't mind him being back up to De Gea if Romero left.

249~~~
What I think, based on Sam's goalkeeping. Yet Romero is only on £50k/w, which isn't a lot for this club, and has international experience and all that. It's the classic dilemma: experience vs. talent.

250~~~
Talent and HG status, the latter we don't have many of atm.

251~~~
He has a year left on his contract. We'll sell unless he extends. Its his decision. If he sees himself as a starter then good luck at your next club, if he's happy to be a backup then extend the contract, send him on 1-2 full season(s) loan and make him second choice from following season.

252~~~
After the England shambles, Sam must rate himself a better goalie than Joe Hart. He must also fancy his chances as a starter for any Championship side. He just needs to pick the right promotion chasing side to eventually get a PL starter position, and the England shirt. That's my career advice to him. He needs to be at least 2nd choice at this stage of his career.

253~~~
Should be second choice and start league cup and Europa league matches.

254~~~
Please no with the Europa part. We should aim to win the thing, not trying our luck with the U21. This mentality was what gave Arsenal and us the trouble both clubs are experiencing. We need to give our best shot to win everything our way. Any trophies is better than winning nothing. Europa league = CL entry too, so why not aim for it.

255~~~
Its below us, how did that mentality give us and arsenal the trouble we're experiencing?

256~~~
We never won Europa League. Why is it below us? When Europa League winner went to CL and we couldn't qualify for CL 2 in last 3 seasons?

We're Man United, back door entries into the champions league isn't our thing. The past 3 seasons have been an anomaly, we should never treat it like the norm. We need to get back to our standards, trying to win second rate competitions is just going to be a distraction.

no doubt he has potential to be a premier league goalie, just needs to play consistently... as a number two. I am not so sure if he got the gametime he needs, if he's number three, he should leave for a championship side, then it will be goodbye.. but it's just insanely hard to get a shot in a club like ours as a goalkeeper, no shame in not making it here. But he's an interesting goalkeeper so it will be a shame..

Mourinho won a fair amount of second rate cups in his previous teams. He played strong team too. If getting into top 4 is that hard and prevents you to win second rate trophies, then that's exactly Wenger's syndrome.

True winner = win anything in sight. You can't be called a winner by winning top 4 spot. Sevilla is more successful than Arsenal the past 3 years and have CL to boot.

If anything getting into CL, by being not a champion sounds more second rate than winning Europa league.

Rather win the Europa League and finish 5th, than not & finish 2-4th.

Who cares about the top 4 spot? Our aim this season should be the league and the Fa cup. Winning Europa means that you're the best of the rest in Europe, we intend on winning the CL sometime soon. Winning this isn't going to help us with anything. Which second rate trophies does Jose play his strongest teams in? 

Wenger's problems have nothing to do with not playing his strongest teams in certain competitions, he's just found it impossible to put together a squad as good as those he had in the past when he was actually winning. Sir Alex, the ultimate winner regularly played weakened sides in cups he saw less important that what we should be aiming for. Winning Europa does nothing for us, we're not sevilla or any of those second rate clubs. I reiterate, we're man united. If we win Europa, win the damn thing with Johnstone in goal!

Copa Del Rey, Copa Italia, League Cup, FA Cup, UEFA CUp with Porto.

You seem to have this weird superior attitude. SAF turned to short term planning in his late year, and aimed to win the league and notice the squad is weak for all the competition. Learn from Wenger the ultimate recipe of disaster of playing U21 in league cup, FA Cup, Europa Cup. The result? We haven't won FA Cup for over a decade. Inconsistent in League Cup. Have some embarrassing exit in league Cup, FA Cup, Europa League, even CL in some of those transition years.

It is understandable that SAF's priority is knocking L'pool of the perk in the league. However, SAF had had some blame toward him for the way we ran in his last few years by not trying to spend enough money to strengthen the squad to compete for all competitions when the market is still cheap. Now this market is crazy and we still need to spend a fortune to strengthen the squad. It's the problem on SAF's part. not master class if you're asking me. Please no. Sam Johnstone as much as I like him to be a integral part of the team is not proven, even as PL level yet, let alone throwing him out there to win anything.

"If you're good enough, you're old enough" not the other way around. He needs to win his spot. Nothing should be handed on his plate or United become a big club by trying avoid second rate trophy. Big clubs aim to win everything in sight. Superior mentality is different to Winner mentality. British football usually has the former mentality and the result shows.
