1~~~
Makes his debut on the 55th minute vs Arsenal coming on for Rojo at left back.

2~~~
100% pass completion so far.

3~~~
Does he play in defense for the youth team? I tend to believe he is wasted their and he is better suited to play as a holding midfielder.

4~~~
So excited to finally get to see him in the first team. His physicality will help him at this level

5~~~
He's played in both.

6~~~
Looks like a unit.

7~~~
He's playing at the back for the U21s but I think most beleive his long term future is in midifeld.

8~~~
Yea, I do not understand why he is playing in the defense for the u21s..

9~~~
Switched with Blind briefly before our 3rd and picked Giroud up straight away and matched his size. Good lad.

10~~~
They'll often do that to 'teach' them different aspects of the game. That's what he does so well those runs.

11~~~
Looks like an absolute physical monster. Bullied Iwobi anytime he got close.

12~~~
Immensah

13~~~
To develop him. You learn a lot by playing in a different position.

14~~~
He's a fecking beast. where have all these kids come from <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

15~~~
Good solid debut (Ignoring that poor backward pass). I look forward to this lad having a solid career.

16~~~
Such a great tackler.

17~~~
very good player. steady.

18~~~
Yea, I understand that aswell. I just assumed that they are developing him into a Centerback rather than a midfielder.

19~~~
Most of his early chances, like today, will likely come at fullback as well so it is good that he is getting experience playing there for the u21s.

20~~~
Looked very strong.

21~~~
Aside from that loss of possession he looked very impressive.

22~~~
Good game marred by one massive error which luckily wasn't punished.

He probably learned more today than he did all season.

23~~~
He's originally a centerback. He's just so good on the ball and can pass that he's also a midfielder.

24~~~
Good cameo today!

25~~~
great debut, he's just beasty player with bright bright future..

26~~~
Suffered one brainfart but looks very mature and confident

27~~~
Bossed it.

28~~~
Evil.

29~~~
Told you he's awesome at tackling. Well anyone who watches him play for the youth team would say that. It's so obvious his tackling ability is amazing.

30~~~
I rate this kid highly. If the injuries don't improve, he should play at CB in the next game and push Blind to the left.

31~~~
And so fast as well. He's like a more likeable and defensive version of Yaya.

32~~~
He has a huge advantage over Riley at LB with his physicality.. His versatility should mean we might see more of him at either CB or RB if needed

33~~~
Bar one shocking pass he was very good.

34~~~
Looks like a bit of a tank physically. Big, fast, strong, and seemed good on the ball (but for that pass). Debuts for everyone!

35~~~
From mourinho

36~~~
I still think he is a CDM.

37~~~
Like the cut of his jib, looks comfortable on the ball and is physically excellent. Looks to have all the makings of an excellent B2B midfielder, hope we get to see more of him.

38~~~
We have plenty of depth in midfield atm, doubt we'll see him play there for now.. The defense is where he's more likely to get some chances

39~~~
Looked nervous coming on and one pass aside played very well.

40~~~
I think it was the first time he played LB, he usually plays DM or CB and ocassionally RB.

For me he is the biggest prospect from this bunch of kids that got debuts lately, he's one of those players that every time you see him play you think he will make it.

41~~~
Considering depth seems to be coming from youth -  who exactly do we have?  Carrick probably can't sustain another year there & Herrera-schneirdlin won't work all the time. 

Schweinsteiger himself is old. 

Fosu mensa guarding the defence (dropping in like cryuff total football)  with another capable linear midfielder like satchel above him.

42~~~
He played at LB for the U-21's a few weeks back.. Was very good actually, I think Van Gaal was in the stands for that game. Might have been against Norwich, I think he scored a goal in that game as well

43~~~
Was solid today. Very very pleased for him.

44~~~
I'm talking about the remainder of the season.. If we bring in Mourinho next season, I'm leaning towards the probability that we won't see most of these kids pay for United again

45~~~
Well i hope we get a different mourinho or a different manager all together. 

Kids beat & held of arsenal.  Why would you come in an ruin that =/

46~~~
Another member of the Class Of 16.

47~~~
He looks ready now, he is certainly a physical presence and in the middle of the pitch could be a main stay for us for a long time.

48~~~
Physically looks very mature, way ahead of what you would expect of a player of his age. He looked a bit nervy on the ball, but did plenty of good too.

49~~~
That pass raised my blood pressure a little too much for my own good. His stature reminds me of a young Pogba.

50~~~
One failed pass but that aside he looked great. Physically, he's ready for first team football and he showed real courage breaking up several passes.

51~~~
He had one sucicide pass but other than that tackled well, read the movement of the forwards well and passed it well, very impressed. I was actually surprised when he came on instead of Riley who played well at LB on Thursday, but I guess LvG wanted his size in there.

52~~~
He says Pogba is his role model. Would love to have another player at the club in the same calibre.

53~~~
Very solid debut

54~~~
He's a fecking unit. Would start him.

55~~~
Was decent when he come on, apart from his misplaced pass to Giroud. What's his natural positon?

56~~~
LVG brought him on ahead of Riley strangely at LB.

Seemed to me he wants to give debuts to as many youngsters as possible so he can have some sort of legacy. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

Anyway did decently. But he isn't a LB at all.

57~~~
I think he will have the edge over Riley because of his physicality, I am 95% sure he will make it here, looks solid at every position he plays..

58~~~
Did not look comfortable at left back.. so will be interesting to see how well he does in a position where he is better suited to. Decent start though.

59~~~
Mourinho would love him. Baby Essien he could be.

60~~~
That may not end up being his best position, but thats where he played at ajax/holland, if im not mistaken. I recall the first youtube clip of him after we got him and he was playing at leftback. I think he played mostly central defence at ajax though.

61~~~
I think Khoazany said once that he usually plays fullback for the Netherlands, not sure if on the left or right. I think it'll be where he gets most of his early chances in the first team.

62~~~
When I watched him playing for u18 (or u17's) for Holland he was the right hand CB in a 3 man defense. He's only played the last few games at u21 at full back as well. Looked very comfortable though, had a lovely bursting run through the middle at one point. Delighted for his debut. I'm kind of shocked RoShaun and Axel Tuanzebe haven't made their debuts yet, as I'd have fancied them to get played ahead of Riley, Weir and Poole. Arguably two of our best talents yet to play for us still.

63~~~
Roshaun Williams is youngest of the lot by a bit though impressive. 

Tuanzebe is injured or he would have almost certainly gotten his debut by now. He was the first one in the line.

64~~~
Have roshaun and alex played at fullback yet? I think thats the only reason the others got their chances before.

65~~~
I think TFM is ahead of them at the moment in that position (if he's used there). Tuanzebe did get called to the bench a couple times. I think it's a little too early for Williams though. Maybe next season.

66~~~
Personally, I think Williams has been better than him for the u21s.

67~~~
Yeah true. All 3 of them are good tacklers, extremely quick and more than decent on the ball. It really could be a complete defense in a few years if all the boys progress smoothly.

68~~~
He would have a legacy just with martial & memphis anyway.  I rekon he is finishing his job quickly incase it's his last season.

69~~~

70~~~

71~~~
Been dying for this lad to get first team action! Came on and did very well apart from that one pass. Our youth system suddenly doesn't look as shit as the media have being going on about.

72~~~
Happy with that. Would now like to see Mensah and Jackson at FB, Smalling and Rojo at CB and give the likes of Blind and Varela a bit of rest for the Watford game.

Mensah....Smalling....Rojo....Jackson

That combo's a tank of a defence.

73~~~
fecking bullied Awoebi off the ball

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/qhyb" width="560"></iframe>

74~~~
Interesting that LvG seems him more as a long term fullback. Type of player who looks like he could succeed anywhere at the back really.

75~~~
He did really well, I've been excited to see his debut for a long time now!

76~~~
He doesn't really say that. He says we have problems at full-back and that is why he wanted to see if he could play there and now he has.

77~~~
The first part of the quote 'I was thinking for a long time that he could play better as a fullback' seems to give me that vibe.

78~~~
Yeah, he can play anywhere across the back line also #6. He can play all roles well. He's a solid footballer. Jackson is also a solid players, he can play CB and FB does both well. They are both young too with a great future ahead.

79~~~
That doesn't really mean long term though. I think it is more the long time hes been thinking about is the last few months where he told Joyce to play TFM at fullback.

80~~~
I love this kid. Want to see more. Looked so confident today even if he made a crazy pass or two haha

81~~~
Yeah, thought the same too. I guess as long as we don't spend as much money as our illustrious neighbours, it is shit.

82~~~
Don't really see him as a fullback with all the options we have there (long-term), so I'd say his future is as a CB or in midfield. 

Anyways, if playing him on the left means we'll see more of him this season, then I'm all for it.

83~~~
I think it was mostly to replace Rojo's physicality and aerial ability that LvG put Mensah on instead of Riley. He looks very exciting though.

84~~~
We need more players with size and strength.

85~~~
Start him against Watford I say.

86~~~
Yeah he looked like a right beast.

87~~~
We need more black players, i agree.

88~~~
Appalling stereotype, soon you'll be saying they are better singers and dancers, and have bigger genitals

89~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> you ruined my next two posts

90~~~
For the ones wondering, yenkoo is Ghanian for let's go, or come on something like that.

91~~~
Looks an absolute beast, any potential to be converted to a midfield player long term?

92~~~
Other than bullying Iwobi for the ball back I am struggling to see what was so amazing about his performance.

93~~~
He's a cb converted to cm being converted to fb mate!

94~~~
Fair dos, he's the one I've waiting for from the academy, be it as FB, CB, or CM reckon he'll do a good job when asked.

95~~~
Yeah he went AWOL for their second goal but he had some good moments too. Plus he's not a LB. Don't think he's ever played there for us before? Not amazing but certainly not a disappointment, which for me is quite pleasing if a young lad is making their debut against Arsenal as part of a hugely inexperienced team.

96~~~
Solid performance for me, maybe that's the reason why some are saying brilliant because he looked so assured whilst being so young and playing in a position I don't think he has really played before.

97~~~
Were you happy welbeck left or one of the fans who are wondering why he left?

98~~~
Terrible post.

99~~~
With Schweinsteiger still around, for guidance, I think we ought to say feck it and use him as our fourth CM because he's got the attributes to be really sensational in the role. A Carrick replacement?

100~~~
Youth production is a waiting man's game. One does not simply invest millions in an academy and then lean contentedly back to watch while the world class talent subsequently floods into the first team. City will enjoy the harvests of their youth investments in the course of the many years to come. It falls to us to match their ambitions with investments of our own if we want to remain top dog in Manchester in the foreseeable future.

101~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/qhyb" width="560"></iframe>

102~~~
I guess. He look a little bit uncomfortable and sloppy in possession. I see potential in there somewhere, but on a whole his performance wasn't exactly thrilling.

103~~~
Happy why?

104~~~
He looked alright. Physically he's going to be fine, and he was ok on the ball despite one bad pas which played them in. Definitely a promising prospect.

105~~~
Looks like a full grown man. Look forward to seeing more of him.

106~~~
I loved his celebration when Herrera scored. Been excited for this kid for a while and I hope he is here for a long time.

107~~~
He's not very similar to Carrick as Carrick has been a great passer with excellent positioning as his defensive strength. TFM is a brilliant tackler and good dribbler, with all round top class physical attributes. I still am not sure if he has the passing range and consistency to play CM, especially at the level required for a top team. But he certainly deserves some minutes in the team, in midfield he'd certainly give us more bite, aggression and pace/dribbling on the break. We're a pretty small team and vulnerable at set plays, which he would be great help with.

108~~~
He's got a real presence on the pitch. Exciting prospect, can't wait to see more.

109~~~
That was just a single mistake. Trust me, as a defender he is really comfortable with the ball and he has great technique. Also in this game he showed his tackling ability.

110~~~
Wow.

111~~~
Don't think he's a left back. From the little I'v seen I think he's a box to box midfielder in the making.

112~~~
That run he went on before he was taken out (and it didnt even lead to a booking, then again, that ref...)

He reminds me of somebody but cant quite put my finger on it. But hes a beast which is great.

113~~~
Delighted he got game time today. Looked unfazed. Doesn't get much more exciting when confident youngsters are coming through the ranks.

114~~~
Imagine how big he's going to be in a few years. Only 18 <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

115~~~
Described him to my dad when he came on: 'he'll boss a few defensive situations, drive through their entire midfield at least once, and probably give the ball away in a mental position.' Cheers Timmy: making me look like I know what I'm talking about since 2016.

Bit pissed Louis thinks he's a fullback though, and especially that that's the reason Joyce has suddenly started playing him there. I like him as a CB and a CM, but he definitely needs to be central, where he can really boss the game.

116~~~
Essien.

117~~~
I was surprised when he said that, I mean he looks like he can fill in at fullback but his future is undoubtedly central.

118~~~
Really excited about his debut. Have been looking forward to seeing him in the first team. Looked calm apart from the usual nervy moments which is understandable considering it was a debut and such a bit stage. Really hoping he breaks into the first squad. Built like a tank!

119~~~
didn't think he'd debut in a first team game so early, against arsenal no less. didn't look out of place at all.

120~~~
Super exciting about him arriving in the first team squad.Still eligible for the U18s.Can see him making some impacts next season.

121~~~
We now have two threads for TFM. Not sure which one to follow more. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

122~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Indeed

123~~~

124~~~
He's got the same type of build as Lukaku, he'll probably become a first team squad member next season.

125~~~
Omitted from the U21 match in which Januzaj, Riley, Pereira, McNair and Love are all involved.

He might actually start against Watford, not too sure on the Rojo situation but there's a very good chance he'll be involved at least from the bench.

126~~~
McNair must be worried about the future, when we'd prefer to play two centre mids at the back rather than him. And the sudden sh!tload of young fullbacks who keep him miles down the pecking order there too.

127~~~
What position is he?  I thought he was a midfielder but I'm guessing I was wrong?

128~~~
Can play all along the back and as a defensive midfielder.

129~~~
Primarily a centre back, but been played a lot in midfield since joining us.

130~~~
I'd love it if he developed into a brick hard water carrier DM like Deschamps or makele.  

One of my favourite type of players and essential if you want to to a top top European club side.

131~~~
We'd probably end up losing him to a European rival if that happens!

132~~~
From the little I have seen, he reminds me a bit of Essien. (And not just in appearance)

I have a big feeling about Fosu Mensah, I think he will be the biggest star from our youth system since Pogba.

133~~~
I don't mind selling him for £70m either!

134~~~
I have that feeling too.  More confident about him than even Rashford.  I've heard lots of good things about him already

135~~~
Yep. Literally translation is "Let's go". But can also mean as "get in!". Are you Ghanaian by any chance?

136~~~
McNair is dross. 

Fosu-Mensah will start assuming Borthwick-Jackson isn't fit.

137~~~
That body type combined with Schneiderlins in the middle could rule Earth. 

Dont really vare where he plays to be honest, just want to see him get some time.

138~~~
I guess he'll start on Wednesday, which would be wonderful to see.

139~~~
I love that suddenly many here have big hopes for him. I do too, but we have to be realistic as well. He has to be developed carefully and if I am not mistaken, someone who watched a lot U21 games earlier posted that the likes of RoShaun Williams and Regan Poole have looked better this season (Although TFM mostly plays in the centre ). So still a long way to go for him. 

I had a lot of hopes for one Rodrigo Possebon too (if anyone remembers him). Look how that turned out. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

140~~~
Definitely not suddenly. Everybody who has followed the academy knows about him. Others can correct me but I would say he is the youngster with the highest potential.

141~~~
I know there are obviously quite a few that have watched him closely and honestly I have no problem if people come on here to shower praise on him, but it did seem like a sudden outburst of comments over him. He had a good debut,  not the best though and we were lucky his bad pass wasn't punished.

142~~~
Williams has been very impressive for the under 21s, particularly because he's still eligible for the under 18s again next year but Poole has only played 3/4 games and has done well but hasn't been particularly brilliant in any of them. Fosu Mensah has been excellent for the under 21s in most matches he's played this season in a variety of positions playing rb,lb,cb,dm and am. If I had to pick one player from the under 18s/21s that I think has a long term future at United it would be Fosu Mensah because he has so many different facets to his game that no matter what position he's been played in he adapts and excels in it. Obviously for such a young player he still has a lot to work on such as concentration and positioning but all of the raw materials are there.

143~~~
Yeah honestly, I haven't actually seen how Williams and Poole have performed to be have an idea of how to gauge them. But I did regularly read comments on here which suggested they were doing very well, in some games better than TFM.  As for Fosu-Mensah, yeah even I have very high hopes for him. Him and Rashford were my two favourites for quite a while now. And yeah, he has been very good wherever he has played. But eventually, I'd like him to settle at CB, with maybe the ability the bring the ball out from the back like how Blind does for us. Even CDM is fine, but I don't think his passing (especially long range) has been good enough for that. But those are things you can develop. As you said, he has all the Raw Materials to excel really.

144~~~
I don't think they look anything alike but I was going to say this also. Seems like a fitting description of his talents- a more defensive Essien. Would be great if he could become that sort of player. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

145~~~
He'll be a perfect box to box midfielder à la Yaya Toure

146~~~
Rodrigo wasn't the same after that injury though. We all have disappointments. I rated Rossi and Pogba lol

147~~~
Would be great to see him from the start vs Watford. Even if it's out of position.

148~~~
how could Poole look better before TFM's debut against Arsenal? He played one game as DM and one game as CB for us, you can tell he was decent as 17 year old but judging by two games...? TFM was great almost anywhere he played for usfrom the very beginning he came to us as 16year old, which is a sign of a great player... He's very young and has got great mentality. Possebon was injury prone Brazilian which says it all...

I have no doubt TFM will make it here if he stays injury free

149~~~
I'm really excited by him getting his debut - I think I rate him highest of our academy prospects; though I have not watched too much of them this season. I always imagined him being a ball-playing defender, or a DM, so I was surprised at him starting at left back. Did good at right back, though, so good to see he was able to cope with being played in a more unfamiliar position. 

I really do have high hopes for him. Would love it if he makes it with us.

150~~~
His pace is absolutely frightening, probably the fastest player in our squad.

151~~~
This is pace he showed in the reserve team right? Faster than Shaw and Valencia in top speed?

152~~~
That'd probably be Ro'Shaun Williams.

153~~~
I'll put my money on Wilson.

154~~~
Which is why I didn't say that. I said I read on the caf, people saying that Poole and RoShaun Williams have looked really good this season. I haven't watched them enough to be honest.

With regards to Possebon, it wasn't exactly frequent injuries tbh. He had a horrific Leg Break playing for the U21s and was never the same after that.

155~~~
So exciting to see young player like him break into the first team.

156~~~
Yeah that was so sad. I was gutted for him. Rossi can't be really called a youth product anyways. But after that blistering start with Villareal, injuries curtailed him too.  Pogba well, he's just doing it somewhere else.

157~~~
Agree. He has insane acceleration. But over the long run, I think others can catch up though.

158~~~
Definitely faster than Valencia, think a bit faster than Shaw as well. Tuanzebe, Williams, TFM are probably the fastest in the club, their speed is insane.

159~~~
He never actually broke his leg. The tackle from Pogatetz was horrific but Possebon only missed around a month because of it. He never looked the same after the tackle though and looked afraid of getting injured so it seems the damage was psychological more than physical

160~~~
Really?? That's what you gathered?? Had nothing to do with him being talented enough to play that role with strength and power? That he was put in that role because of an injury??

He can't come into the midfield for now because Mata, Herrera and Schneiderlin are doing well. He's on the bench as a back up defender (a CB) as well as a back up midfielder (a DM). It just so happened that Rojo got injured and we needed someone with height, pace and power.

161~~~
it would be interesting to find out if he was faster than a pre-leg break Shaw

Shaw broke the speed records at Southampton, which is remarkable when you consider the likes of Bale, Walcott etc came through the doors there

162~~~
you are partly right. He did return quick but as far as I recall United did confirm that he had a leg break

163~~~
I thought he looked a bit nervous after coming on, passing the ball overly simply.

Then he goes on a run through the middle of three or four Arsenal players and I realise I might just be a bit stupid.

164~~~
And Le Tissier. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

Still, I'm thinking Bale wasn't really lightening when Spurs bought him, but trained up his pace, a bit like Ronaldo with us.

Or am I wrong?

165~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1061050/No-broken-leg-Possebon-Fergie-fuming-Pogatetz-horror-tackle-Brazilian.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...-fuming-Pogatetz-horror-tackle-Brazilian.html</a>
He got injured on 23rd of September and was back in training 2 weeks later and played again on 22nd of October

166~~~
actually im just reading the updates from that time, looks like you're right

167~~~
Yeah it makes his regression all the more bizarre

168~~~
This is a huge myth. He was out for 2-3 weeks and people actually reckon that those 3 weeks out of football were the difference between him becoming world class and ending up in Brazilian 4th Division.

169~~~
so you're saying he was just crap?

170~~~
Perhaps its his pace due to which LVG thinks he should be a full back?

171~~~
He probably wasn't that talented if he ended up where he is right now. Or just did not work hard enough, I don't know. Clearly there was something wrong other than being sidelined by injury for 2 or 3 weeks, I don't know a single footballer who was never injured and a 3-week injury does not usually turn Iniesta into 4th rate footballer.

172~~~
He is not faster than Luke Shaw, I'm not having that. 

Anyway I hope he gets restored back to his CB or DM position,  although I'm fine with him playing at fullback for the first team right now.

173~~~
He didn't look out of place at all on Sunday, he has the presence of a full grown man. Just a complete physical specimen.

I wonder what position he will ultimately make his mark in. Would love to see him slotted in at DM like he has been for the youth team.

174~~~
Didn't know he was dutch!

175~~~
I'm referring to the interview when LVG mentions that he watched TFM, decided that he'd be better as a fullback, and told Joyce to start playing him there. Obviously I have no problem with him getting his first-team bow there if that's where the opportunity is, I just don't like the idea that Van Gaal sees him playing there in the long term, because I definitely don't.

176~~~
I still don't necessarily think thats what van Gaal meant. We are having serious injury problems at fullback so he saw TFM and thought he could do well there so asked Joyce to play him there to see. I don't think it means anything about where he will end up playing but we need a fullback now and he thought TFM would be a good fit.

177~~~
van Gaal is not really going to decide on his long term future anyway. At most he has a year and a couple of months left on his contract. At which point Fosu-Mensah will still be young. If he's earned a lot of Premier League experience playing full-back for us in the mean time he's probably better off for it than if he's only played for the U21s.

178~~~
I understand the excitement for young players and realise we have a talented player on our books but I didn't see much from Sundays performance that has led to the over excitement in this thread.

Could it be the fact that we finally have a player built like a tank with impressive physical qualities and people are getting excited over the type of player he seems to be rather than what he can do.

179~~~
If Van Gaal or anyone turns him into a left back he or they needs to be sacked for that. Stupid decisions and a waste of his talent.

180~~~
Nah, pretty sure Bale was into athletics or something like that. I remember hearing or reading that he was rapid in school.

181~~~
Probably. He ran the 100m in under 11 seconds at the age of 15.

182~~~
Probably because a lot of people have seen more of them than just Sunday's match and even if they haven't its impressive that a player who is still eligible to play under 18s football came on for his debut against one of the top teams in the league and didn't look out of place

183~~~
I liked what I saw. He is physically ready for the league, and did some great things with the ball and positioning his body under pressure. Made a couple mistakes too, but he strikes me as exactly the sort of player we are in need of at present. And don't underestimate the importance of physical qualities - speed never takes a day off, as they say.

184~~~
I thought he looked very nervous tbh, but in reality, he was thrust into a high pressure match where we were under the cosh a bit at times. Can't judge him on that appearance. Gave away the ball horribly that one time, but fingers crossed it's a learning curve and he can potentially be one for the future.

What's with all these chavvy kids having double-barrels? It's cheapening my surname.

185~~~
I ran it under 12 when I was younger than that!

186~~~
All of the players in our academy are talented. You get there by talent, you survive and improve yourself because of your mental strength. Your head game is the most important factor in football and you never know who's going to lose it be it because a family member died, living in another country is hard, you don't care enough or you might be depressed.

I reckon you can side depression as a factor for many of these cases. Very few footballers knowingly have it despite numerous scientific reports showing that professional athletes have a higher depression rate than the general public. It's simply just not talked about.

187~~~
hope this fullback thing is just part of his development and getting games at u-21 and senior level. he looks like a top class CB/DM in the making.

188~~~
Ghanaian Dutch!

189~~~
You should start watching him for the youth team then. I'm much more impressed with his technique, passing ability, and tackling ability which will become apparent to some of you the more he plays. If he didn't have that part of his game in combination with his physical qualities, I would be much less excited.

190~~~
Okay. Right back it is then.

191~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

192~~~
Will probably start cb tonight with Smalling and Carrick out

193~~~
Bet LVG puts Rojo at CB and Fosu-Mensah at LB.

194~~~
Oh, I hope so. Would love to see more of him. I'd expect a couple of mistakes, but he's still so exciting a prospect.

195~~~
Starting tonight, I'm glad. Always held him in pretty high regard as a youngster, hope he does well.

196~~~
He has only just turned 18.

197~~~
Is he definitely playing as a CB tonight?

198~~~
Easy tiger. It's simply easier to start at fullback then at one of the hardest positions, where you'll be against most teams better players.

199~~~
There's a bit of a difference between sub 12 and sub 11 for 100metres though...

and I thought we all ran it sub 12 in our youth...or we remembered that we did...

200~~~
Nothing in the fact he came on against one of the best teams and looked like he'd been there for years?

Compare that against Donnie Love, McNair, Blackett etc...

201~~~
Mike S also played as RB, as he couldnt get games ahead of Vidic or Rio as CB, gametime is the reason.. and in this case also injuries

202~~~
I think he played CB tonight

203~~~
Bit of a nervous start for him.

204~~~
Growing into the game, completely outmuscled Deeney  ...

205~~~
He's getting sent off tonight.

Don't think he's even attempted a tackle without diving in so far.

206~~~
Yep, needs to settle down here or it's up to Louis to sub him before the ref removes him right now.

207~~~
Tough game making your full debut against two strikers who are a complete handful.

208~~~
Nervous start, but he's settled well I thought. Blind having a shocker right next to him doesn't help.

209~~~
A walking red card

210~~~
Despite his nervous start you can see how talented he is.

211~~~
Blind has been all over the place today - shocking. Mensah has amazing recovery pace - he saved Blind's ass, along with DDG of course. Even if he could not put in a good enough tackle,he forced the attacker wide. Looks good on the ball as well. No doubt we miss the physicality of Smalling though.

212~~~
If Blind continues playing like in the first half he'll be sent off.

213~~~
probably the worst opponent for a young cb to make his "debut" as Ighalo and Deeney are a fecking nightmare to play against.....he did okay.

214~~~
This. Kid is having a lot more to do thanks to Daley not being awake. Wish he was paired with Smalling

215~~~
Tbf playing against Deeney and Ighalo on CB debut is not easy but surprised he's been put in at CB.

Hope he can reign himself in a bit or a red card seems on the verge.

Tuanzebe is injured or he might be more ready to be CB at this level than Fosu Mensah who positionally can get caught chasing a ball more.

216~~~
Much improved in the second half.

217~~~
Very good, especially considering Blind was fecking all over the shop

218~~~
He was better than Blind tonight.

219~~~
After the first 15-20 minutes he did well to calm down and stay on the pitch. You can see the raw ability is there for definite, though.

220~~~
He misses something at CB, dont think he should be CB long term, Williams/Tuanzebe are better prospects in that position. Decent debut nonetheless.

221~~~
He did well for his debut at centre back. The Watford front two press hard and are strong. He was actually our best defender on the night! Great lesson for him.

222~~~
He's so raw and clearly not yet ready. But he does look to have the potential to be a good centre back.

223~~~
When you consider how stupid Ighalo and Deeney have made some more established centre backs look this was a top performance.

224~~~
Timmy done good.

Put him next to Smalling when he's back

225~~~
I think he did really well.

226~~~
Well done today

227~~~
I thought he did well enough considering how bizarrely bad Blind was tonight, so he didn't have the calm leadership next to him you'd want for a young CB on his debut. I could be wrong but I think long term he will be a DM, but he's got something about him, no doubt.

228~~~
Think he had tough task tonight and he had lapses here and there but in most cases he didnt harm us,so for his age,vs those 2 upfront he did really good in my book.

229~~~
Before his injury, Axel was caught out of position and chasing into midfield quite a bit for the u21s.

230~~~
This.

231~~~
Looked very nervous for the first 10-15 minutes but after that he grew into the game and had a solid game.

232~~~
Well done. I love to see more of him.

233~~~
Proud of his performance, I really like his potential for the future. He settled into the game and had to shoulder a lot of pressure, and he ultimately came through for us.

234~~~
Not as much as Fosu Mensah though who was publicly criticized by Joyce IIRC as well after which he removed him from CB and played him elsewhere promoting Williams or pushing CBJ in when he could.

Both need to learn positionally but feel at CB Tuanzebe is more ready.

235~~~
Wonderkid.

236~~~
Solid stuff, partnering him with Smalling would be something. Both quick, powerful and smart defenders.

237~~~
Shaky at points, but still impressive against a good strike partnership, especially considering the rest of the defence was a bit shaky and Blind was crap.

238~~~
Difficult opposition but I wasn't impressed by his performance. I thought he was guilty of waiting for the ball to reach him too many times, rather than getting to it first and clearing before there was any danger.

239~~~
Did well, I like him. A lot.

240~~~
The kid is class.

241~~~
Looked okay especially considering how Blind was playing. Don't think he's ready for this level yet though.

242~~~
Pretty rash at the start but like Varela against Arsenal, he did well to calm himself and not do anything stupid for a second booking.

243~~~
Luckily was a OK debut from him but was unfair on him that Blind had such a nightmare!  Looked raw, which he is, but talent and self belief is certainly there

244~~~
Great performance considering Blind's weird performance. The way he closed down Ighalo in the first half when Blind lost the ball was amazing.

245~~~
Class against the likes of Ighalo and Deeney. Rash start but did well. Full First team member next season.

246~~~
Was relieved that he didn't see a red with the way he was diving into tackles in the first half. 

Looks talented, but it's way too early for him. May be appearances at the fullback positions, if needed.

247~~~
As long as we don't feck about playing him outside of centre back or left back, he should develop into a real quality player.

248~~~
Had moments of rashness, but that was just inexperience. Thought he looked promising today. 

Considering that his defensive partner was making schoolboy errors along with being unable to clear the ball, pass it out, win any tackles or headers - he had a lot of responsibility at the back. Also given that Deeney and Igalho are so strong and fast and never stop pressing and have a good linkup play (Igalho's brainfarts today aside), and that he was on a yellow for much of the game - it's a great achievement in itself that TFM didn't get overwhelmed by it all.

There's tons of potential in there, but let's see how it goes.

249~~~
Young kid making if full debut and couldn't even rely on his more experienced partner to have a reasonable performance.

250~~~
He is much more of a CM/DM than a LB. Players are also capable of playing more than one position, and it is often good for their development.

251~~~
Future star for us. I think he will get more time this season.

252~~~
I'd be all for letting him take Jones place in the squad.

253~~~

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

254~~~
Talk about chucked in at the deep end, up against the most physical attack in the league and alongside a half asleep Blind.

255~~~
Looks a player more suited to a defensive midfielder

256~~~
Promising performance. Was miles better than Blind even though he was up against a really physical team. Showed good tackling and decent passing.

257~~~
Exactly. Big ask but thought he did very well after a nervous start.

Big prospect.

258~~~
Kept his head which was particularly impressive considering he was playing alongside Daley Blind. Good performance overall.

259~~~
Impressive debut in difficult circumstances. He seems extremely confident, on the ball and in his tackles, and also looked pretty vocal which is good to see.

260~~~
Got through it. It was a tough game to be thrown into. It's obvious he has a lot of talent and fantastic pace and strength. Looked a little bit raw still and uncomfortable on the ball. He kept just booting it up the field. No idea why people see him as a midfielder when he can't really pass the ball. It seems insane to me.

261~~~
Did well considering his partner decided to have his worst ever game for us, and he got an early booking. Looks raw, dont think he should be CB long term however. Seems 'needs must' right now.

262~~~
he had to make that tackle for which he was booked, Varela was out of position and he just had to stop the player getting to the box, so I have no complains. I think he learnt a big time again this night against one of the strongest striekrs in the league and in the end did really well.. Also made some fantastic challenges. SO I am not worried for some of his passing which has been generally also good despite giving the ball away dangerously on one or two occasions but so did Blind and it was even bigger mistakes. I think Dutchies must have rolled something but Blind didnt's like the model.. was so off and let TFM looked like a senior player.

hopefully he wont be played in midfield for the next game..

263~~~
He can pass but is a bit inconsitent, he's got decent vision and we are all talking about a midfielder who breaks up the play and drives forward with the ball , he's perfect for that role of DM/defensive b2b, that energy and drive is pretty much wasted as a defender.. it is also quite hard to throw a player into this unexperienced side and expect him to do exeptionally well under s much pressure like today, Blind is great passer but he looked like U-16 player today with his passing..

264~~~
I really like what I see from him. Incredibly young to be playing centreback and I was scared he was going to get sent off, that would have been awful for him. SAF so often played young defenders like Brown, O'Shea, Smalling and Jones at fullback as they can't do as much damage there while still picking up valuable experience. Talk about getting thrown into the deep end today, I'm glad he got through his first start and actually did rather well.

265~~~
Some eye-catching tackles, several moments of lovely quality, a couple of mistakes, and weathered a good battle with one of the league's roughest strikers in Deeney fairly well. Sort of what you'd expect from his debut and he can be pleased with that.

CB is a hard position to debut in when you're young, especially next to an unusual sort of defender like Blind. If he'd debuted next to Smalling, he wouldn't have had to worry about his aerial and positional responsibilities so much and could have focussed on his strengths: stepping out aggressively to tackle early and then driving forwards with the ball. As it is, he and Blind are too similar to be particularly complementary as a partnership - both shortish, both prefer to step out than stand off, both CBs-cum-CMs. So that made the job tricky, but he handled it well.

266~~~
I thought it was a promising full debut all in all, especially considering he was being let down badly by the senior players to his left, He did get caught the wrong side at times and judged a few balls incorrectly, but they're minor gripes.

He'll almost certainly bring someone down as the last man and get a red card at some point though.

267~~~
He really can. You can hardly have expected to see it from him today, most of the time it was panic stations from the back line.

268~~~
Name any 17 or freshly 18year old player who plays as CB for a top club regurarly? It was a big test to play him there cinsidering he was being played all over the place lately and started next to Blind who made so many errors.. I think he did so well considering all circumstances... but would rather play him out wide for a couple of games before starting him as CB, it was a risky selection from LVG but in the end it paid off

269~~~
In midfield he is more of a Essien type of midfielder than just a holding one or a tiki taka one.

Not the most polished passer in terms of consistency but can pick out some beauties as well and carry the ball powerfully forward driving at the opposition.

Also has a good shot and finish on him.

270~~~
Most of our problems came from our players trying to pass out from the back. TFM did the smart thing in the face of Watford's press.

271~~~
Start him with Smalling, would be fun to watch.

272~~~
Quite. Pretty much every problem in the game came from them being bigger than us and us unable to win a first ball, either in attack or defence. Blind reacted to this by trying to keep it on the ground much too optimistically, hence repeatedly giving the ball away. TFM did the sensible thing and just hoofed it when necessary, regardless of the fact that Rashford didn't have a hope of collecting any of those long balls.

273~~~
Very raw, was very impressed by his turn of pace on the Igahlo one-on-one in the first half, had a 2 yard gap and made it up very comfortably, then he got a bit too eager jumping in. Not afraid to put a challenge in and was the calmest head in our back 4, I think he's worth rotating with for the rest of the season though, I think him and Smalling together would be interesting.

274~~~
Thought he'd get sent off today, but did well. Shaky at first, as you'd expect considering it's his first start and he's up against Deeney and Ighalo, but he did well. Definitely has potential.

275~~~
We've never really used that kind of player here. If you're going to play midfield for United you need to be an excellent passer. TFM isn't and won't be. He's made for CB imo

276~~~
Not at the level we need here though. He'll get ripped apart by our supporters if he ever ends up playing in midfield. Having energy is a tiny tiny part of being a midfielder at this level. You need to be very good on the ball, aware of everything around you and comfortable in tight spaces. He's not that kind of player. He could make a very good CB though.

277~~~
You underrate him. He's very young and obviously not ready to be anything for the first team yet, but he's more than got the ability - in his passing as well as his ball control and tackling - to be a senior DM for us. He's shown that at youth level, for us and internationally.

278~~~
Continue playing him in CB. Just not alongside half-asleep version of Blind. Pretty exciting to see what would happen if he partners Smalling.

279~~~
Darren Fletcher says hi.. the game changes and the teams as well, it can take more than 50 years to find a new Scholes etc... we will play with what we have and what manager wants not what was United known in the past.. Despite all that TFM just turned 18 and has all the time to get better at passing, having a good vision is important - its hard to learn over time and that he has, so I have no doubts over him even in your United team with preferable type of def. midfielder..

280~~~
I honestly don't think he could've faced a harder attack this season. Ighalo and Deeney clawing onto you with their athleticism literally all game would ruin most defenders. Maybe Leicester, as Vardy/Okazaki trade physique for sheer pace and stamina. Though Fosu-Mensah looks rapid, and would've probably dealt with that type of threat a little better.

281~~~
Not one of Ander, Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger, or Fellaini are excellent passers.

282~~~
That's one of the problems we have though. With that being said I'd love it, if he develops into a player similar to prime Essien.

283~~~
Baptism by fire against Ighalo and ugly Drake, I dunno how many 18 year olds could have matched them like he did.

284~~~
Looks promising and with a partner who's mind hasn't gone walkabouts he will hopefully have a big future here.

285~~~
I was really impressed with him. He got absolutely no help from either Blind, who mixed being exhausted with being all over the place, or from Herrera who made it his mission to put his defenders under as much pressure as he possibly could all night long.

He had one ten minute spell in the first half where he lost his way a little, and looked in danger of being sent off, but otherwise he dealt admirably, often in spite of rather than helped by his partner at the back, with one of the toughest units in the league. I'm really excited about his prospects.

286~~~
Looked good tonight, not an easy full debut at all, Watford play good football and Blind had a horrible game too. I was impressed, showed pace and strength.

Very excited about him, but I think he will be will better in midfield, he could be a monster for us there.

287~~~
For the people saying he will be better in CM for us, have you actually seen him play there? Or is this a case of he said she said kinda thing so I am going with the flow?

288~~~
He's great on the ball and a solid tackler, why not play him in centre mid? In the future, of course

289~~~
Then why not keep him at CB and use him like a Rio or a Evans? Build the attack from the back. I know Evans was a shit defender for the most part but his passing and build up play from the back was very good.

290~~~
Well yeah, it's a good job Schneiderlin is turning out alright otherwise I think a player like Fosu-Mensah would be the perfect player to play in our mid, still could be. He seems quick too, hard tackler and a decent passer. Definitely think his future lies in centre mid.

Who knows, maybe he's a decent finsher too and could be a great box to box mid?

291~~~
Ander and Bastian are fairly good passers, think you are being harsh.

292~~~
TFM is a CB or DM for me

293~~~
Are you 13?

294~~~
Well yeah you need some with excellent passing but not all need it like what he said. As evidenced by our midfield, Coquelin and Ramsey at Arsenal, Fernandinho and Fernando at City, Dier at Spurs, Matic, Mikel, and previously Ramires and like you say Essien at Chelsea. Not everyone needs to be an excellent passer. 

Yeah, fairly good not excellent. They both severely lacking any range in their passing and Schweinsteiger has shown very little ability to make penetrative passes. That's my point though, they are both good midfielders. Good enough to play for us and other top teams, well maybe not Schweinsteiger anymore, despite not having excellent passing.

295~~~
The sky's the limit for this kid here. He has the tools to play in any central roles.

296~~~
Not sure if he would know who Darren Fletcher was is he was 13 unless he is a scottish 13y.o

297~~~
He is pure raw talent. I think he looks one of those players who doesn't need a loan move and can thrive, learn and grown playing as a squad rotation player for us in the next couple of season.

298~~~
He looks very raw, but the talent is there. Needs to be a little less rash and patient - kept diving into tackles even when on a yellow and sometimes stuck too closely to his man. He's a beast though, and showed intelligence when taking Ighalo wider when he got through on goal.

It's hard to judge because Blind was absolutely horrific today, and Varela was very average when defending as well. You'd ideally want a young CB to come into a defense that's settled and top of its game. Grew into the game as it went on. 6.5/10 for me

299~~~
why do you ask, are you less?

300~~~
Early days but I think performances like today will help him claim an official spot in the squad next season, probably in the expense of Jones.

301~~~
Haha didn't hear that one before but oh so apt...

Thought he did quite well tonight.  He showed his inexperience but the instinct and the physical skillset are there.  Good prospect.

302~~~
<iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x3lf79b?width=500&amp;hideInfos=1" width="500"></iframe>

303~~~
He did well - in some senses - strength and recovery tackles - but was a bit all over the place position wise and chased the ball around like a kid at times (especially the first half). That said, he's very young and these things can be learnt.

Not many teams play with two strikers anymore, and Watford have two good ones who work very hard. Even though he had a lot help from De Gea and Ighalo, he managed to come up against Deeney and Blind (who were a handful) and come out with a clean sheet.

304~~~
Very hard game to judge him off. Watford basically pressed us to pieces and their physicality was at times too much for our patched up team to handle. We could have been a few goals behind by HT. But he did show glimses of his talent despite that with a few good tackles and ability on the ball.

305~~~
Was tough for him to handle Ighalo, Deeney and Blind at the same time but did reasonably well IMO. Not many teams will have a striker pairing as good as Watford right now. Decent debut.

Showed excellent maturity to recover from a very early yellow card.

306~~~
develop him into the next McGrath says I......

307~~~
develop him into the next McGrath says I......

308~~~
develop him into the next McGrath says I......

309~~~
I don't know how you guys can judge a defender so quickly - be it quality or crap. Maybe I just don't know how to judge defensive talent. To me defenders/goal keepers are all about consistency. They kind of have to build their trust which is why I am always a terrible judge of young defenders.

310~~~
Naïve performance. What you'd expect from a recently turned 18 defender making his full debut.

His talent is obvious, just needs experience

311~~~
Louis liked it or is he just blowing smoke to boost his confidence?

Sounds like TFM is here to stay from now. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

312~~~
Looks like I'm wrong then. Looks like vna Gaal is trying to Alaba him. LVG seems to be able to see the fullback side of everyone.

313~~~
He's nothing like Fletcher. Why are people so desperate to make him into a midfielder anyway?

314~~~
I don't underrate him. I think he's great. I just don't get why you're so fixated on the idea of turning him into a midfielder when he's clearly a defender.

315~~~
I think it is because many here believe he could be a very good Makelele or Yaya in the making. I can see why he would do well in a CDM role but seeing as United never ever play that way, his future has got to be at CB. It will dilute his attacking instincts to the game however.

316~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Sad innit that the kid had to babysit Blind when it should have been the other way round...

317~~~
You're right, we don't play that way. The Makelele role does not exist in our team.

He's nothing like Yaya. As for his attacking instincts, I'm not sure he'd find it as easy to attack at first team level. His attacking instincts basically amount to being very very fast.

318~~~
Good. He looks a very good prospect and, as Van Gaal says, turned in a creditable performance against two very physical and imposing Watford forwards. Deeney and Ighalo are not top-drawer players by any stretch and it will be interesting to see how FM does against, say, Kane, who has a lot more to his game. Perhaps we'll find out soon enough.

319~~~
What happened to Blind last night? He was awful. Someone on here likened him to Prunier which made me chuckle. The last thing we need is for him to lose form at this time.

320~~~
He has quite a few tricks up his sleeve too from the videos I saw of him. So if given proper training, I think he can probably beat a man or two. And by Yaya, let me rephrase, the defensive version of him.

321~~~
Another victim of Van Gaal's utter ignorance on the concept of squad management, he's played relentlessly for so long that fatigue has caught up.

322~~~
So be it. Jones hasn't been fully fit for a reasonable amount of time since Fergie left.

323~~~
Early days, to say the least, but I must say I like the thought of TFM and Mike as our CB pairing.

Anyone knows which side TFM prefers? We all know Smalling must be the right sided CB or he goes to shits.

324~~~
He's such a beast.

325~~~
Did i understand it wrong... but did LVG say in the post match presser that he asked to be subbed in the second half ?..

The potential is there and with time on his side, he could become a great player.

326~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/fosu-mensah-manchester-united-tribute-10981347" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Van Gaal: "Timothy has saved us three times I think because of his speed and I was very pleased he was on the pitch. I let him stay on the pitch in the second half because he was the player who always closed the door for us"</a>

327~~~
“I think he is a better full back than a central defender but he is from origin at Ajax always playing right centre midfield or <b>right </b>centre half. This is his position."

328~~~
Cracking tackler, and I don't go along with the nervous remarks, I thought he was very decisive, with Blind the one doing the cock-ups alongside him.

What was clear is that he had no intention of holding the ball to look for a good pass, he invariably and quickly passed alongside or back to goalie. He did that well enough though, and it may have been drilled in to him to stick to that for his first few games and concentrate on stopping.

329~~~
He has been much better in midfield than in defence for the ressies/juniors. He can defend, alright, but is not massively positionally disciplined and switches off at times.

330~~~
I know Van Gaal said last night that he normally played right cb at Ajax but whenever he has played cb for our underage sides he's generally played as the left cb with Tuanzebe or Williams on the right

331~~~
Hope he gets another run out today.

332~~~
He went to ground the other night to much for me. No coincidence Blind had his worst performance of the season next to him. But showed himself to be an exciting raw young talent. A young Sol Campbell on our hands here lads!

333~~~
Can't put those awful passes and his lack of awareness down to TFM. I recall Varela making a backpass with Ighalo closing in and Blind pretty much stood there leaving De Gea to do it all.

I'm a big fan of Blind but nothing was coming off for him that night and it was his own fault.

334~~~
Blind consistently being beaten in the air, losing foot races and making hospital balls is down to Fosu-Mensah? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Come on.

335~~~
Yep but much easier to play when you don't have to babysit someone (and you do and rightly so on the kids debut). I'm not Blinds biggest fan I think he's a good player but not good enough to be a regular centre half or good enough to be a regular centre mid. But he is a very valuable player for the squad and he's had a good season. Just not top class.

336~~~
dont agree with anything you said here. Blind showed his absolute incompetence last game when he should be the one who calms the young lad's temper and helps him throughout the game. TFM was easily better and bailed Blind numerous times.. I can agree he's raw but only mentally, physically and ability wise he seems good enough even now, CB is one of the toughest positions to play in football for young footballer as there is a lot experience needed so lets see how he develops but I bet he will thrive much more as DM with his energy and drive forward.. He's nothing alike Campbell

337~~~
Blind's countless brainfarts had nothing to do with Fosu-Mensah.

338~~~
I like him, but he needs to stop getting turned so easily. It's especially a problem when he's at fullback.

339~~~
He's very like a young Sol Campbell imo. You didn't think he went to ground to much for a centre back? You agree he's raw but only mentally, physically and ability wise? But you don't agree with anything I say? You have lost me!

340~~~
very calm player. 

going to be huge for us.

341~~~
Continues to show off his tackling ability. Shame he had that awful shot, though he's never been great at that area. lol

342~~~
My expectations were higher with his shot. But it was atrocious. 
It would have been fantastic if he scores. 

Blind has been playing really bad the last games. I would rest him and play Fosu-Mensah next game.

343~~~
I rate Timothy very highly and think he will be a key player for us for years to come but bringing him on today when chasing a game made no sense, he isn't a game changer.

344~~~
Was it TFM that made that tackle right near the end when West brom just ran past Carrick and Schneiderlin? It was crisp and clean.

345~~~
Yeah, think it was him.

346~~~
Is he best suited at CB, CDM or CM?

347~~~
my bad, almost anything, Sol campbell comparisons are way off..he's completely different prospect..

348~~~
Nobody seems to know, he's a CB for me but I've only seen him play like 5 times.

349~~~

350~~~
Understand that there isn't a lot of games left now but would love to see him given an opportunity at DM.

351~~~
Back in the squad, excellent.

352~~~
The pecking order is quite clear at the moment.He's the 1st choice CB after the seniors with Williams 2nd.Don't know where McNair and Poole currently stand though.

353~~~
McNair has faded away. I think he'll be off this summer or out on loan

354~~~
Will have him start over Rojo, Blind or McNair at CB to partner Smalling, even though he is far from ready yet.

355~~~
Mcnair has been dropped like lamb into a lancashire hotpot. Feel for him to be honest. Been well and truly rinsed and hung out to dry.

356~~~
What's up with Tuanzebe' injury ?

He was first choice before that it seemed.

357~~~
He had a groin injury but is back in training this week

358~~~
He isn't anywhere near good enough though to be fair.

359~~~
Mcnairs not even as good defender as Blind and worse on the ball too, for me he has no chance to make it here, Williams, TFM, Tuanzebe are all stronger, faster and better defenders while good on the ball as well, let alone younger with much higher potential. In my view Mcnair should go on loan and maybe tried as DM from there he doesn't need to be as strong and fast, he can ping the ball around in what he is decent and just screen in front of back four..

360~~~
I'd rather start him at left back than Rojo/Darmian.

361~~~
Agree

362~~~

363~~~
I'm sure most of the young players do. 

Nice of him to get in LVG's good books for the remaining games. <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

364~~~
I like how Mensah just said that he's not there yet, still 18 and want to be patient for his chance showing that he knows he's still not ready, inexperience and wants to learn more. In contrast with Pogba situation. I wish Pogba had the same thought and he would have stayed with us.

365~~~
I think Pogba made the right decision. It was a brave one, and had he failed, chances are that his career would have dwindled to nothingness.

Pogba then proved that he was ready. Its us that werent ready for him.

366~~~
Pogba made the right choice. He left and became one of the worlds best midfielders. He was more than good enough to be playing for us back then.

367~~~
Well that's quite a exaggeration. He was too talented and physically ready for that too happen.

And he got fair bit of chances end of that season and would have gotten more and more next season if he stayed. Hell next season even Frickin Powell got about decent game time in his first 6 months at United in midfield. And Pogba wasn't exactly a immediate starter at Juve during the same time frame either.

It was just a ego clash with SAF ultimately. The not getting chances stuff is overblown big time given Performances at the time.

368~~~
Rafael played in midfield ahead of Pogba ffs. Fergie for some reason was less willing to give youngsters game time towards the end.

369~~~
It was just 1 game ffs and at that time Pogba was already clashing with SAF and not exactly doing that great for the U21s due to taking it easy.

Pereira has had like 20+ similar occasions already you could say under LVG last 2 seasons.

370~~~
He actually didn't prove us that he was ready in that season. He proved that he was ready in the next following of that season. If Pogba stayed, Sir Alex Ferguson would have give him more playing time as much as he got in Juventus.

371~~~
Thats not what I meant.

What I was talking about was him going to Juve and failing. He would have come across as another youngster who thought they knew better, and actually didnt.

That was the narrative for a while.

372~~~

373~~~
U19's?

Glad he got some game time.

374~~~
On at HT vs Everton for Rojo.

375~~~
Playing RB, it seems. Not perfect but I prefer him getting that experience over Valencia playing. Hope he does well.

376~~~
Good cross, well done son

377~~~
Looks like a really good passer of the ball. Plays those quick passes into space well

378~~~
He's going to be a player.

379~~~
Would have him starting over Rojo any day.

380~~~
Just play him. Id prefer him over all healthy fullbacks that we have + Darmian looks much better on the left.

381~~~
He should be awarded with a start. A fantastic prospect.

382~~~
What a talented player he is. He played really well as a right back today, that assist and run he made showing that he knows how to play as a full back. And as a centre back he also did very well. He can be a good option for both our right back and centre back option next season. My MOTM for second half.

383~~~
Play him in MF,he got great understanding with player around him.

384~~~
hopefully he starts from now, great young player with massive potential..

385~~~
Best sub of the game! Has taken to the 1st team even better than CBJ did

386~~~
He looks like a beast.

387~~~
Looks like a seasoned pro

388~~~
Really good today, created and prevented.

389~~~
I think that's the plan. Possibly get 2 ball playing CB's have Fosu mensah guarding them. The 352 in defence and 433 in attack.

390~~~
As he was coming on the commentator was talking bare shit that it wasn't the attacking substitute we needed and TFM wouldn't offer much going forward. He sure shut him up and he was sucking "Tofu-Mensah" off for the rest of the game.

391~~~
Would be surprised if he didn't make it here from what i've seen so far of him. 

It's a joke that i'm far more relaxed with him in the side with only a handful of appearances to his name, than a player who started in a World Cup final.

392~~~
I think we will see his best in midfield. He has the long strides which makes me think he will be a very good box to box marauding midfielder.

393~~~
All he needs is one moment of showboating and LvG will drop him like a hot spoon!

Top talent!

394~~~
Massive talent.

395~~~
Already looks better than Rojo and Darmian, that said most of our wingers are better full bacl than them two.

396~~~
He's great.

397~~~
LVG was the one who bought him wasn't he?

398~~~
Changed the game for us, great performance imo.

399~~~
Gamechanger.

400~~~
Has the attributes to be a top player. Exciting talent for sure.

401~~~
He did but it won't stop him from his philosophy

402~~~
<iframe class="vine-embed" frameborder="0" height="600" src="http://vine.co/v/ijxIuX3rUDb/embed/simple" width="600"></iframe>

403~~~
Jose will like him at least.

404~~~
I do like what I see from him, but at the same time I can't help but feel that many on the forum are going overboard about him (overboard about his actual performances, not his potential). His game today was much like it has been in most of his appearances - a few very good things, a few things that were a bit sloppy and perhaps could have hurt us on another day. While I hope he'll go on to be the beast that he has the potential to be, I think people are getting ahead of themselves atm. For instance, if he were fit I'd still feel more comfortable with CBJ.

Of course on the other side of the coin, I'd have no problem with him being picked ahead of Valencia at right back, and maybe even Rojo and Darmian.

405~~~
Caption Contest? <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

406~~~
He just has an air of quality about him, liike I said about Dembele last night, despite the age he has no shortage of belief that he belongs at this level. His assist was good and he was even better at CB where his reading of the game and timing were very impressive for such a young player.

Edit* Needs to get his boots sorted out, he slipped over 3 or 4 times.

407~~~
Layers of potential under already developed youngster from almost every standpoint with just insane physicality for a teenager. Everton was almost bullied today when he came on... using their own method against them is the right thing to do.

Mourinho will certainly know how to sharpen that blade.

408~~~
I feel people have the right to be excited about this guy, I certainly am. I think he has all the attributes to be an excellent player in multiple positions.

I really want him to have a chance in the defensive midfield role at some point, but for now I'm happy with him getting the experience in defence.

409~~~
Played at left back,right back and MF,impressed with his defensive side of the game,his run to the box for an assist was best I've seen from our RB this season.
Since i had not seen much of his youth/reserve matches i'm not sure how his creative side of game from MF,but he look like well all round player to me, got great future ahead of him.He need more playing time,with our injury trouble at back we might see more of him at that back line from now to end of the season,if at we are lucky then yes manager need to try him at MF.

410~~~
If Blind has done his hammy I have zero issues with him playing at CB in his absence.

411~~~
I personally think that we don't need midfielders that pass. If we play compact enough - our CB's can do the passes Carrick does with ease.

Get high energy box to box midfielders who carry the ball forward and let Fosu mensah drift in an out of defence and attack.

412~~~
Was a fecking beast today! That clearance was Vidic-like <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

413~~~
I enjoyed when out muscled Ross Barkley. It is good to have some top physical attributes in the RB position for a change.

414~~~
Looks to have massive potential.

415~~~
I really like what I've seen of him so far. Seems quite good on the ball, quick, strong and a good tackler. His balance and composure look like they could improve but that's to be expected. Looks like a big talent.

416~~~
The black Maicon <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

417~~~
Looking seriously impressive. Has the build and ability on the ball to be an excellent center back as well. Hopefully he keeps developing like this and avoids injuries, as even if Mourinho comes, he'd surely utilize him for his versatility like he used Zouma kind of.

418~~~
I like very much.....He is going to be a solid player,i'm more excited about him than Rashford

419~~~
When is his interview complaining about being played in multiple positions? Oh nevermind, he isn't a gutless little cnut.

420~~~
'Hey, were you turned on by that?'

' nah..just checking my wrist'

421~~~
On his way to Paris next week.  Said in the Mirror.

422~~~
Timothy Foss-Immenser <img alt=":cool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie4" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Cool    :cool:"/>

I'll leave.

423~~~
Absolutely no worries with him on the pitch, most young players even when they are having a good game you think could mess up or lose their head. With him he just obviously is a top flight footballer, no doubts.

424~~~
Timothy Fosu Immensah

425~~~
If he played in Portugal we'd be lining up 40 million bids for this kid!

426~~~
Won't want to be in a fight with him.

427~~~
I'd wipe him out tbh.
Nice and flowy animal movement ftw

428~~~
What's his best (or future) position then? He's played all across the back four for the 1st team so far, and he's played in the centre of midfield for the U18s/U21s. He hasn't looked uncomfortable in any of them either. Looked a natural at RB today, and equally at home when he moved into the middle. Would quite like to see him as a defensive midfielder for the first team to see what he can do, especially with Carrick looking shot and Schweinsteiger injured.

429~~~
He has more time to select a pass at CB so I think that's where he should play as I don't think that's a strength for now. In the future only God knows. Very impressed today though both at full back and centre half. Been a long time since we've had such a composed bunch of kids coming through.

430~~~
Him or CBJ over anyone other than Shaw for me. Club is blessed with excellent young defenders. Our next Manager is going to have to find a way to give them all game time.

431~~~
One of the big reasons I just don't want mourinho at this club. Will be so hard to say goodbye to this talent. I really think he could go on to be as highly thought of as pogba. Don't care who we get but don't want to see the young players progress interrupted

432~~~
He's a fecking unit, with skills on the ball. i like him a lot.

433~~~
He's a huge lad with great athleticism and technical ability as well, Mourinho wouldn't treat him any differently to how he treat Zouma.

434~~~
that's a sign of a great player, don't really care where he plays now, he just needs to play so he can develop as quickly as possible, but judging by his attributes he will be best used as defensive minded box to box midfielder, I only mentioned defensive as he quite lacks some shooting ability but he doesn't seem out pf place with his vision and passing fro deeper so let's see, but midfield it is,can be our Kanté!

435~~~
You offer some serious weird opinions m1y2

436~~~
so what is the thing you dont agree with?

437~~~
I don't think he'll give an 18 year old centre back much game time unless he's already proven like varane or zouma but we'll see who is correct

438~~~
Well he probably won't have much choice. I'd imagine he'll ship out Jones, and that'd possibly make TFM 4th choice cb.

439~~~
So confident he's going to be a top player for us!

440~~~
Seriously? TFM is excellent and I really think that he will make it here, but Rashford is a striker and he is arguably our most exciting player from our academy on GOd knows how long. He seems to enjoy himself while playing, and does things that you won't expect from a player that young.

441~~~
Looks the part, did really well and didn't seem fazed at all.

442~~~
Nice to see our future CB pairing finish the game. Two beasts

443~~~
I I like a Rashford as well but I really have a good feeling about TFM and I think he will be a huge success here and will get a better chance than Rashford as we will probably get Lukaku or Rooney upfront next season

444~~~
I I like a Rashford as well but I really have a good feeling about TFM and I think he will be a huge success here and will get a better chance than Rashford as we will probably get Lukaku or Rooney upfront next season

445~~~
I I like a Rashford as well but I really have a good feeling about TFM and I think he will be a huge success here and will get a better chance than Rashford as we will probably get Lukaku or Rooney upfront next season

446~~~
Built like a beast.

447~~~
How many good-looking players do we have? Fosu-Immensah, Darmian, Blind, Shaw, Mata, Herrera, Martial...

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

448~~~
You don't need to repeat stuff 3 times,  I'm sure we're all in agreement that he has top top potential.

449~~~
Apart from being a fecking tank, he has a brilliant name too.

450~~~
<a class="username" data-user="42095, @rooney2009" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/42095/">@rooney2009</a> : loves himself so much he posts everything 3times.

451~~~
Apart from Martial, there's no young player in this squad I'm more convinced of than Fosu-Mensah. He's a little raw in his positioning, but his terrifying physical ability and good tackling sees him through right now, and he will only get better. I'm excited about him. He could be the Vida to Smalling's Rio.

452~~~
Played well today, would really like to see him get some minutes in central midfield.

453~~~
was thinking he should play in CM myself. Very talented lad. Strong and gifted. Can tackle,pass and run at players. See's that opportunity. good awarness.

454~~~
Pogba 2.0 athletically. Much better defensively, wonder if he can pass and shoot?

455~~~
yes

456~~~
much composed and hard to get pass by compared to darmian or rojo. an excellent prospect.

457~~~
Would love to know what we are feeding this cnut

458~~~
Had a good effort to Rashford in the match, didn't come off but showed he had the vision.

459~~~
It's not really United's doing, he was like this at Ajax as well. But Tuanzebe and Williams have similar physique though.

460~~~
Well, whatever it is I want some. He's almost as big as Valencia ffs <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

461~~~
Looks an exciting prospect. Would like to see him get more sub appearances before the end of the season,

462~~~
Is he two footed ?

463~~~
so where is his best position? Where does he play for the u21s?

464~~~
I would like to see him start at right back with Darmian on the left. No more Rojo!

465~~~
Yeah, alot of black footballers are beasts at a very young age.

466~~~
Love him, wish he played for Ghana <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

467~~~
Only if he get rid of that bum fluff <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

468~~~
Yep plus I'd also be happy with Valencia at right back than Rojo in the team.

469~~~
Hugely impressive performance and what a prospect. Looks a complete hardnut too and we need some more mettle on that pitch.

470~~~
Timothy F-ing-Mensah. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Let's not get ahead of ourselves, here. He does look like he could be a decent players for us. Here's hoping.

471~~~
He seems to have a great attitude and also seems very thankful for the help he has been given.

472~~~
Needs a solid season under him next year, something like what Lingard got this year. It would do him massive good. Still hope he plays at CB long term though. If he adds passing to his game, he can play in a role similar to Ferdinand.

473~~~
Top player. Between him Borthwick we will be fine for years.

474~~~
Somebody crank up the hyperbole machine. It's time.....

475~~~
He's an absolute beast. Maybe my personal favourite of the youngsters that have come through this season. Something about him screams quality to me.

Could also see Mou potentially being a big fan.

476~~~
He'll be a centreback or defensive midfielder but he can cover at full back. Predominantly being played at the back but he's got the potential to be a very good DM, it's his natural position and I think that where he'll end up.

477~~~
I wish he would keep his place ahead of Rojo but LVG is blaming Rojo's performance on jet lag so no doubt the World's Most Average Defender (two years running!) will be back in vs Spurs

478~~~
He can't shoot. Honestly think that's his only bad quality.

479~~~
Don't forget Tuanzebe and RoShaun Williams! I really hope we manage to give them all opportunities in the coming years. TFM in midfield could be exactly the kind of player we've been waiting for.

480~~~
What is he like in the air usually? He seems a bit on the short side for a centrehalf but then wiki has him down as 6'3'' which surprises me a bit. Maybe he just looks short cos he's so wide

481~~~
No chance is he that tall, that'll put him up there with Smalling. I think he's more 6-6'1 at best. Still though as Blind has shown, it's all about reading and positioning.

482~~~
We could use some physical superiority in midfield. Could he take the role of United's Makalele or start developing him as a long term defender in cooperation with Smalling ? Perhaps would be better to go for more established youngsters in that role like Stones, Laporte or Marquinhos but Mensah can already do a lot on the pitch... seems way more aggressive than Darmian, too.

Feck knows what's his best role as LvG seems to complicate things sometimes.

483~~~
He is quite tall, not Smalling but I think about 1.85 m.

484~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sptRQ_SdnVw?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

485~~~
We may be in a bit of a mess atm but tbf to us, the team togetherness and spirit always seems to be top notch.

486~~~
He reminds me of Alaba. Similar face and versatility (full back, midfield and centre back). Alaba was originally a midfield and converted as a left back at Bayern but since Guardiola came, Alaba has been playing first team in left back, midfield and centre back. I can see a similarity between Alaba and Mensah. Mensah is just natural brain talent for a footballer and with additional of physical and technical gift he has, he will be a top player. I don't think midfield is his #1 position as I think his passing is still not good enough for top team level but that doesn't mean he can't improve that aspect so he might can prove me wrong for this one. Right back and centre back he looked very good and ironic that we actually need right back, centre back and another centre mid as well. I can see Mensah will be used as a first team starting eleven anytime soon but playing everywhere like Alaba.

487~~~
Just imagine having him and Renato Sanches developing together and building a formidable midfield for seasons to come!

488~~~
Look at the final frames of that video. He's a good 3 or 4 inches taller than Martial, who is himself 5' 11". I think he's about 6' 3".

489~~~
He's a promising young player no doubt but he needs to cut out all this Panama tax evasion nonsense.

490~~~
I met him a while back and he wasn't much taller than me and I'm 5'11" I'd say he's 6'1" at the most

491~~~
An 18 year old you met 'a while back' is likely to have grown in the meantime. He's more than 2 inches taller than Martial.

492~~~
Yeah I'm sure he's grown a huge amount since I met him a month ago. Here's a picture from yesterday

493~~~
That's clearly a misrepresentative picture if you watch the last few seconds of the youtube clip. When they hug, TFM is noticeably taller.

494~~~
If Mourinho is our next manager, I hope he gives opportunities for younger players.

I can see Fosu-Mensah and Renato Sanches having a good partnership if they fulfill their potential. Add a creative midfielder with a front of 3 of Martial-Kane-Dembele and we would have a great team for years.

495~~~
Are these misrepresentations as well? He's not 6'3" he just comes closer to the camera than Martial at the very end of the video. When they shake hands at first there isn't much difference in height

496~~~
Can we discuss his height a little bit more please?

497~~~
He's definitely not 6'3".

498~~~
He's taller than Rafael
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CVtGutlWwAAr04E.jpg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CVtGutlWwAAr04E.jpg"/>

He is not taller than a bus
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/115209.jpg" src="http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/115209.jpg"/>

499~~~
You're right to argue with jb about this. He generally knows nothing about our youth prospects.........................

500~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

501~~~
Can you please set up a new thread for the height debate - no mega threads remember - this is just for his performances.  Thanks

502~~~
His performances have been so impressive that nobody has a clue how tall he is.

503~~~
He's constantly growing on people... with the performances of course.

504~~~
But can he hit the heights that his fellow compatriot Daley Blind has at United so far? A tall order.

505~~~
If Jose could reach a bus by standing on defensive pillar made of Cahill & Terry there's a real chance Mensah will outstretch his vertically rising abilities of a cross/shot stopper to Blind's level who by the way still must rise above his midfield education and constantly add to his defensive growth.

506~~~
You must struggle to breathe so far up his arse.

507~~~
well christ, the man pretty avidly studies youth football. Beyond that I don't know anything about him.

508~~~
I think it's fair to assume he isn't 6'3 anyway <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> 

Carrick is definitely taller and he is 6'2.

509~~~
What a player.

510~~~
He's clearly got no idea where he's supposed to be at full back. Time and time again Mata is having to cover the danger on the right.

511~~~
He is great.

512~~~
Yep good player, great potential, but I'd rather him central.

513~~~
Finally a proper fecking defender coming through the youth system.

514~~~
He's fantastic

515~~~
I think this. Positionally all over the place but entertaining to watch.

516~~~
Would agree with this. Looks good and confident on the ball though.

517~~~
Been saying for ages he's gonna make the perfect Vida to Smallings Rio. Loves diving into a tackle, in a good way. Actually tidy enough on the ball too. 

My only worry for him that his physical excellence, competent technique and versatility will see a Jones like situation occur where he's constantly moving from LB to CB to RB to DM.

518~~~
A proper footballer....

519~~~
Yeah, not that this is really United's doing tho.

520~~~
That's easy enough to teach with time and experience tbf. That pace, power and tackling though is incredible.

521~~~
Looks like he has been asked to follow Ericken

522~~~
If it's a tactical ploy then it's awful. It's leaving us ridiculously exposed and rendering Mata useless.

523~~~
Was thinking this too, can be the only reason why he so central. But strange to put your right back man marking someone and its leaving Mata exposed at the moment.

524~~~
Indeed

525~~~
Excellent half so far, although he seems to of been told to stick on Erikson similar to what Varela was asked to do. Not sure the benefit of it, but hey Van Gaal logic

526~~~
Like a young Micah Richards

527~~~
Hmm I can see the comparison but he's much more talented.  

He looks the part and definitely looks like he could be a star just not sure what position he could play and I worry he might be one of those Luiz type footballers who is super talented but doesn't have a fixed position and is tactically reckless.

528~~~
We did it with Varela on Coutinho and it was awful then. It's entirely possible that Fosu-Mensah is just unsure of his position, understandably given he's so young and it's not where he's used to playing, but Van Gaal has made a habit of sticking with shit ideas that don't work.

He looks a terrific prospect in fairness. As I say that he plays everyone onside.

529~~~
It's not his fault whether it's tactical or otherwise. He's not a full back. But it's a massive problem at the minute and the whole teams shape is suffering. Smalling and Blind seem to be following Kane and Lamela too so it's probably just Van Gaal being an idiot again.

530~~~
I can see the Jones scenario as well

531~~~
I think it's tactical too. A stupid tactic, but when isn't a van Gaal tactic stupid?

532~~~
Great so far.

533~~~
Yeah it has to be, otherwise he would never play for LVG again.

He has made some great tackles and has been decent on the ball but has made a few positional errors.

534~~~
Isn't he a midfielder.

535~~~
I Agree. I prefer him more central. Also, Mata as right winger doesn't help. He should play as CB or CDM.

536~~~
Mata's average position<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

537~~~
At first I thought he was just drifting out of his position but he's spent so much time central now surely one of the CB's would have told him to go back to the RB position if that was where he was meant to be. It looks like we are playing a back 3 with Mata as a wingback.

538~~~
Clearly we are aiming for a fluid back four.

539~~~
He's probably saved us from conceding two goals.

540~~~
Maybe if we had Lingard playing that side it might work but you can't do it with Mata, he just doesn't have the physique for it.

541~~~
What is his favorite position again? 

I enjoy watching him but I don't want another Jones (very talented player but can't land a good solid position). In his case, he has the height to be CB I think. Still need to see more of him.

542~~~
DM, but can play full back or centre back.

543~~~
Cb or dm.

544~~~
<img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

It's better to be outnumbered out wide than in midfield and it's thanks to TFM that we haven't been outnumbered in midfield. Given that's been Spurs' main strength this season and something they've been particularly effective at against the top teams, I'd say it's proving pretty successful personally. Just because it's unconventional doesn't mean it's stupid.

They haven't had a shot on target and clearly haven't been able to play their normal game...

545~~~
It's led to Spurs best chance of the game. It's also led us being completely incapable of holding on the ball in the last 20 minutes of the half from the moment Spurs woke up. If he doesn't want to be outnumbered in midfield then okay an extra midfielder. Don't ask Mata to play as an auxiliary full back.

546~~~
If we didn't play that way then us being outnumbered would be the source of their best chance of the game. The fact they have had 1 shot on target, and have only had one real chance, suggests the defensive strategy has worked well not vice-versa. Given their recent record in big games it's not surprising we're being cautious either

547~~~
That's if you ignore the fact he could've picked three in central midfield and not completely nullified the right hand side of our attack while he was at it.

548~~~
I hate to bring up the height thing again but is there any reliable source on his height? He looks shorter than Martial.

549~~~
feck hope he's OK

Lad bloody loves to put in a tackle though<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

550~~~
This guy is unreal.

551~~~
He's not only quick and strong, but he's clearly got a lot of talent on the ball. When you consider his versatility too, he'll be a vital player for years to come.

edit - ah feck. The curse continues.

552~~~
Bah. Hopefully it isn't too long term, he does look a talent.

553~~~
Hopefully nothing serious. Superb game today, looks a talent.

554~~~
feck our luck with injuries

555~~~
It's just crazy.

556~~~
Oh feck off.

557~~~
Hopefully just a knock.

558~~~
Physical specimen with decent instincts and not bad on the ball.

559~~~
Of course they score right after he comes off.

560~~~
Instantly fecked in his spot the minute he went off.

561~~~
The shackles are off for Erikson now

562~~~
Yeah I'd say the fact his replacement has been directly at fault for all three goals is confirmation TFM was doing a very good job on their most dangerous player.

563~~~
Lad was saving us the blushes all along

564~~~
Directly???

But yes, Fosu Mensah was brilliant today.

565~~~
First goal was more on Smalling and Blind. They both went for the same header. How does that happen? Sunday League stuff. Both high up the pitch. 3 touches later it's in the back of the net.

566~~~
Immense talent this lad. 

I have the utmost respect for the way in which he has taken to first team football like a duck to water. Much like his fellow youth team mates CBJ, Varella, Rashford etc he plays without fear and with absolute confidence in his ability. Expecting big things from him during his United career.

He needs to keep his adrenaline in check and stop running all over the pitch like a mad man though.

567~~~
He stopped two near certain goals by being acres out of position <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Never change, Timmy.

568~~~
He was superb today. My man of the match, but I personally feel Spurs would have still scored those goals had he been on the pitch. It was just a coincidence that when he went off we conceded three. 

People also forget that Lamela should have scored in the first half, probably due to Mensah being too narrow.

Don't get me wrong, like I said, he was superb, but it's easy for people to just pass the blame.

569~~~
He fecking loves it this guy.

570~~~
Well done son. I'd rather play the kids every game than seeing Mata Rojo Darmian pull on the red jersey.

571~~~
The one shining light today. He's gonna be a beast.

572~~~
Still quite raw and has a lot to learn but looks like a real talent and had a good game.

573~~~
He was beast today I thought. React so quickly unlike Darmian. But too many unnecessary reckless challenge. He needs to stop doing that so he doesn't turn into Phil Jones (injury prone).

574~~~
Brilliant

575~~~
Was very good today,all fell apart as soon as he got injured

576~~~
I don't think he did that. I think he was asked to cover Erikson and so left mata to cover the rw.

577~~~
MOTM

578~~~
He did indeed.

Imagine 10 TFM's lining up in front of DDG next week. Only great things could come from this believe me.

579~~~
Awesome player, has a huge future ahead of him.

Not positionally disciplined enough to be a full back. I think CDM/ box-to-box midfielder will be his best position, where we can utilise all his best attributes.

Hope Mourinho can transform him into our own Essien. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

580~~~
This guy is brilliant don't know why he's only starting to get game time now, should be first choice, only good thing to come out of this game. Hopefully the injury isn't to bad.

581~~~
Good game today. Played very narrow, almost like a third CB and allowed Blind to go further up to close down Alli. After he left we sort of lost our shape.

582~~~
He's a centre back isn't he? Why are so many wanting him to play in midfield?

583~~~
Sounds like a Football Manager experiment right there!

584~~~
Seasons almost over so I'd let him loose in midfield. Just let him charge around.

Knew he'd get injured though. Guy's fearless.

585~~~
Are you trying to say that a great manager such as LVG, with his unending knowledge of football, would encourage a player to intentionally run out of position in order to close down a single Spurs player, all the while leaving gaping holes in the position he is supposed to be covering - in this case right back. 

Oh... wait a minute.

586~~~
Put him in midfield and sign Renato Sanches. Mourinho will let them run havoc

587~~~
He's still very raw but I'm super impressed by his decisiveness and knack of coming away with the ball more often than not. It took Smalling a fair few years to get that sort of aggression into his game and I think Fosu-Mensah would be best served by being developed as a centre-back, it will take a while to get the positioning spot on but his raw attributes and his anticipation and timing of the challenge are perfect for a ball-playing CB. It was actually jarring to see how decisive and physical Mensah was vs. other players (look how pathetic 3 United players were on that first Spurs goal).

I wasn't quite sure what the plan was with Mensah today but I do not think he was helped by Mata on the right whose idea of communicating seemed to be pointing at people and hoping for the best. There was one point when Mensah was in front of Mata by about 10 yards and was about to press Eriksen where Mata pointed to Rose running in behind himself rather than tracking back, Mata was clearly uncomfortable all afternoon and he did not help Mensah at all who seemed to play more on instinct. Think the blame has to lie here with Van Gaal, Lingard should have switched out wide left, Young wide right and Mata in behind Martial for the second half.

588~~~
Would defiantly like to see this.

589~~~
Because he filled in there a few times in the U21s. And because people don't know what they are talking about

590~~~
He's a fecking machine.

591~~~
For regular watchers of the reserve sides, how good is Mensah on the ball? I can't really see his future in the middle other than a holding midfielder and I would think it would be a slight waste of his raw attributes in such a specialist role. I could understand if the rest of the team was more or less there and we needed someone to play that role but I think he'd be far better being bled as a pure centre-back.

592~~~
His tools are more useful in midfield. I spoke to a few Ajax fans who say he was always considered as a potential future box to box midfielder in the youth setup there.

593~~~
Our MOTM. He was everywhere. We need more people like him. Smart player, but is a machine too. Built like an ox.

594~~~
He is a footballer, not everyone has to be defined by a single role. He regularly plays in midfield for the youth and u21 side and has been impressive there and it also frees him up to get around the pitch so it is understandable why many see his future in midfield. There is also more of a spot in midfield for him with Smalling and Blind already being good and Tuanzebe and Williams being equally talented CB prospects, imo Williams is even better.

595~~~
How so?

596~~~
He made several excellent tackles today and is strong in the air, he's going to be a special player for us I feel.

597~~~
Is that you Louis?

598~~~
No just someone who realizes footballers aren't imbeciles and can in fact play more than one position.

599~~~
He's a top talent this lad, we went to pieces after he went off.

600~~~
No point in dilly-dallying in his positions during his development stage though. He should play in one position/area and stick to it, if we have injuries then his versatility can come into play, but how many world class players regularly change position?

601~~~
Yeah, looks a center back to me. Quite quick though and pretty decent on the ball, could equally be a very good fullback for us. He's been defensively excellent so far.

Shaw and TFM as fullbacks would be interesting.

602~~~
As appreciative of that as I am I do think sometimes it's better for the development of young players to focus on a specific role. I do think SAF pissing around with Jones and Smalling at RB and in Jones' case midfield did slow their development. Obviously that's not to say Mensah isn't capable of play two roles to a high standard but I am a little bit weary of shunting him around just to make him fit in the team. As good as Blind has been at times this season there's no denying Mensah should be a better fit at CB, especially against more physical and pacier sides.

603~~~
He isn't a world class player though so it is irrelevant. Young players often play multiple positions and I'd agree with the likes of Warren Joyce who believe it helps in their development. TFM has no set position so there is no point restricting him to one role.

604~~~
And it can equally be argued that what actually slowed their development was being injured all the time and Smalling's time at RB has actually helped him become the CB that he is and what makes him so great at recovering and mopping up plays out wide.

I'd also rather he be getting the experience in any position than sitting on the bench because he is only allowed to play in one specific spot.

605~~~
Not saying he is world class at the moment, but he has the potential to be world class. To be world class you need to know your position inside and out. How do you expect anyone to be world class, when they are constantly switching positions, look how that turned out for Jones.

Like I said, when we have injuries and at the moment, just to see him in the team I don't mind. But I don't want another Jones scenario, when he is constantly getting games in the team, I don't wanna see him in his best position.

606~~~
He is perfectly suited to being a defender. We need defenders. You would rather play him somewhere where he won't be as good. It makes no sense. Throw him in beside Chris and we'll be sorted.

607~~~
I would play him in midfield. We need a tackling midfielder. He can replace Carrick. Mensah/Morgan/Herrera.

608~~~
I don't think Smalling's time at RB helped at all, if anything of the very few things Van Gaal has done right it's developing Smalling and making him become a more decisive player. Of course Smalling not being injured all the time has helped. I agree just playing helps Mensah a lot now but there's definitely a decision that needs to be made soon-ish to ensure he utilises his talents as much as possible. Whether as a CB or CM they will be roles that require a lot of learning and we shouldn't waste time with him.

609~~~
He is perfectly suited to being a midfielder. We need midfielders. You have no idea whether he won't be as good in midfield. Throw him in midfield and we'll be sorted. See I can spout shite as well.

610~~~
Brilliant today. I hope his injury isn't a bad one. PLEASE give him a chance at DM though, I think he could be excellent in that position.

611~~~
I fancy him as a DM actually. I think his ability on the ball and driving runs will be wasted at centre back.

612~~~
Who would've thought a 19 year old was holding our defense together.

613~~~
He also loves a good tackle, as seen many times today. 

I think he would thrive at DM with the right players around him.

614~~~
He's isn't though. He might be decent as a destroyer but he doesn't really have the range of passing to be top class there.

Yes you most certainly can.

615~~~
I agree. I think it also helped him become better on the ball, playing in those tight spaces and having to pick his passes quicker and under pressure. His RB performances were very up and down, but I imagine the experience helped in that respect. He always looked a great defender when he first joined, but early on he looked like he'd never been in possession of a football in his life. His passing still isn't brilliant, but it's infinitely better than it once was. His touch and dribbling is much better too.

I'd like to see TFM as a #6. From his performance today, he was great, but he is attracted to the ball and always wants to be where ever the ball is, which a centre back just can't do. A defensive, ball winning midfielder would have a bit more freedom to close down opponents and make tackles higher up the pitch or out wide whilst not leaving gaps in the back four.

616~~~
Looks like a beast, hopefully Mourinho sticks with him rather than look for an alternative.

617~~~
Only 18. He isnt 19 till Jan 2017.

618~~~
Also, an 18 year old and 20 year old is holder our attack together...

619~~~
Or maybe Jones was just never that good and getting injured every second game has a negative impact. You can't just throw Jones out there and say any player who plays more than one position will not make it. I can equally list young players who only played one position and turned out shit. David ALaba playing LB, CB, and CM aren't stopping him from being world class. TFM is 18 and doesn't need to focus on one position, the experience of anywhere is more beneficial to him and will play a bigger part in him becoming a world class player than restricting him to only one position.

620~~~
Well I and many others disagree. Why haven't I been graced with your extensive knowledge in the reserve forum before?

621~~~
I don't think anyone has a problem with him playing RB

622~~~
Maybe because you're usually too busy typing to read

623~~~
He is only 18 and he seems very keen to impress, there was just something that screamed CB when he came across to block that Walker shot. IIRC he closed off the angle for the cross to Eriksen first and then when he realised Rojo was fecked he wasted no time coming across. It's that natural instinct for defending that's pretty much impossible to teach, he's positionally so raw but he clearly thrives on defending and that got him through the game today. Already in his short time he's made a heck of a lot of key saving challenges and I know it's early days but he just reminds me of Vidic a little bit in that he really looks like he loves to defend.

The issue seems to be more the team than Mensah, he could easily plug into 3 different positions with the way the rest of the team are playing.

624~~~
I've read your grand total of 1 post in the reserve forum. I'll admit it was absolute gold how you shared such knowledge without even posting a word. Please come by and share some more some time.

625~~~
He can certainly be pleased with his display. Just hope his full commitment style isn't too Phil Jones esque In terms of injuries!

626~~~
I doing a disservice!

627~~~
What are you on about? I've posted in many of the reserve threads and in plenty of the young player threads. 

Either way I don't see the relevance. I've been a consistent watcher of the youth teams and reserves for over a decade. It's an idiotic way for you to try and make a point.

Instead of talking about my posting habits why don't you explain what you see in TFM's game that makes you think he should be a midfielder for Manchester United.

628~~~
How many times have you watched him?

He absolutely can pass the ball. Given he's not long been 18 it'd be amazing if he didn't improve in that area as well.

629~~~
To me he is a natural centre back who would prefer to play in midfield.

630~~~
Not that much. Probably around 10-15 times. I know he can pass the ball. I just don't think he can pass it well enough to justify moving him out of defense. I think he'd probably make a decent midfielder but potentially a great defender.

631~~~
He's a complete footballer. He has all the physical attributes plus a footballing brain to match. He's also very skillful on the ball and can pick out a killer pass. He has everything in his locker that Pogba had the same age. For me it's a no brainer. He'll excel at CB but he'll be more useful as a box to box midfielder IMO

632~~~
Quite a definitive statement to make about a lad whose just turned 18.

It's not like he has to exponentially improve on the ball to make it here as a CM. He'll probably never be as good as Scholes on the ball but then Scholes couldn't run like him either.

633~~~
He's a very different type of player to Pogba. Weird comparison <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

634~~~
Search is fecked up btw,

635~~~
Obviously it's not a definitive statement. It's an opinion. It is possible to have an opinion on a young player. They don't usually completely change their games (barring the odd exception)

636~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

So much teenage angst in this thread based on an 18 year old's best position.

637~~~
Cheers, as stupid as it was to bring it up, it still confused me a bit <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

638~~~
Far better than Darmian

639~~~
He looks about 6'1''.

640~~~
You're just vastly underrating his current ability on the ball. He doesn't need to completely change his game to be a CM.

I've seen him play as a No.10 for the U21's.

641~~~
I agree with this, I think Williams and Tuanzebe are both more natural as cbs and understand things like positioning better whereas Fosu Mensah follows the ball or the player he's marking a bit too much but usually gets away with it because his recovery pace is exceptional. I prefer him in midfield because it allows him to get more involved in the game and makes use of his engine and his ability to drive forward with the ball. Its amazing to have 3 defensive prospects as good as Fosu-Mensah, Tuanzebe and Williams all coming through at the same time and all 3 of them physical beasts for their age and lightning quick and I'd be disappointed if at least 2 of them don't make it here long time

642~~~
To be a decent enough CM, probably not.

643~~~
For what it's worth it would be great if he turned out to be as good in midfield as you all are saying. I don't quite see it myself but would be happy to be proven wrong. Really looking forward to watching this kid develop as a player.

At 18 he already looks like an absolute beast even in comparison to PL players. He's strong as an ox and I wouldn't be surprised if he's the fastest player at the club.

645~~~
He is a monster, imperious performance from him. Not a coincidence that we fell apart as soon as he went off. Some of his tackles in the middle and on the left side of the pitch <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> Probably would be better as a defensive midfielder in the long run, he needs to be in the middle of the game as much as possible

647~~~
Shaw.

648~~~
I'm sorry, I was being a dick.

I think he'll do well in any position but I think Williams is better and should be brought through along with Tuanzebe which crowds the CBs so that is one reason I'd like to see him in midfield. As jb says I don't think his positioning is as good as the two others and one of his best attributes is his ability to drive with the ball, playing at CB would completely limit that from his game. As can be seen from today's game he has a tendency to follow the play a bit and likes to throw himself in to challenges which you will be punished for at CB and is better suited to midfield. His physicality and engine would also solve a problem we've long had in midfield. 

There is play in here which shows why he would offer another dimension further up the field and is capable of some exceptional passes.

649~~~
Very suspect with his defensive positioning. Offered a threat going forward & got stuck in all over the pitch.

650~~~
Weird how? I've watched them both play. They have similar attributes. Both physically impressive and powerful, both technically adept, both skillful/great on the ball and both have the ability to carry the ball and run down channels for days, both have great vision and an eye for a pass to bring others into play, etc. How is it a weird comparison? If anything the only thing that sets them apart IMO is that Pogba had goals in him. Mensah hasn't shown much of that because he's obviously been groomed for more defensive roles, but he might have that ability as well.  The comparison is far from weird. Now tell me how Mensah is not suited for midfield, i'm curious as to why you think he isn't.

651~~~
Think he was very good, maybe once got carried away too much and left a blank space in defense but if you dont commit yourself you might not create anything. I was very pleased with how aggressive he was in the tackle and how far he steps out when he press, He's very quick so he can cover the ground back quickly

652~~~
Agree with the other poster, I don't see the comparison.

The two players have different mindsets to me, a different ethos. TFM is a destroyer first and foremost, Pogba a forward thinking player. For instance could you see Pogba playing CB?

653~~~
I get what you're saying, I've seen Pogba play in reserve games and at Old Trafford and at that young age he was very similar in terms of height, power, determination.  

But I'd say it's like comparing Roy Keane and Nemanja Vidic - similar attributes but different positions

654~~~
Superb today.

655~~~
The thing is I see Mensah's future as a box to box midfielder and nothing else. This defending jack of all trades is just a development phase for him IMO. Time will tell.

656~~~
I was a bit as well to be fair. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I'm not saying for a second he can't play football. He clearly can. I guess the difference of opinion we have centres around the attributes you need to play CM. Whilst useful, I've never really seen speed and physicality as attributes that are best utilised in central midfield. At high levels the game tends to be more congested and it's much more about intelligence, vision, range of passing and being really comfortable in tight spaces. How many players with TFM's pace do you ever really see playing in central midfield. How often do you see the game open up enough for a CM to really open up his legs and use real pace? Not that much, especially at the highest levels. You rarely see top midfielders sprinting around. The room isn't there. That's different to U21 and U18 where the games are slower, more open and he can just run past people. It doesn't really translate to first team football.

I'm not saying his pace and energy wouldn't be useful. Kante at Leicester is a perfect example of how it can but we don't really play the way Leicester do. We tend to play against teams that sit back and make it difficult for us to break them down. While a decent passer I don't see TFM as the player to that much damage against these types of team from central positions. I think he'd be wasted there.

I'd like to see him at CB. Under SAF we used to throw everyone forward because we knew we had a couple of quick CBs to defend against counter attacks. With TFM and Smalling in our defence I think we would have that. His quality on the ball would mean he'd also be able to step out of defence with the ball and use it well which is important. 

You obviously really like him. I'm sure you're right. If he wasn't groomed for a defensive role he may well smashing in volleys from 30 yards out every second week like Pogba. <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

All joking aside, to say TFM's ability with the ball is anything like Pogba's is a huge reach. It's not close. In the same way that Pogba has nowhere near the type of pace and ball winning ability TFM has. Different players with different attributes. It happens. 

I've never said he's not suited to midfield. I've simply said I think he's much better suited to defense. For the reasons described above.

657~~~
Imperative performance. Him subbing for  darmian 100% cost us the game and 4th place

658~~~
how bad is his injury?

we need players like him if we are to have a chance at top 4.

659~~~
Pogba had way better technique, vision, passing, and shooting ability. On the other hand, tfm has much better tackling ability, and is more physically dominant. Basically one is an offensive weapon and the other is a defensive weapon.

I can see tfm as a box to box, purely because he also has the ability to drive with the ball. Apart from that I'm not impressed by his midfield ability if we're purely looking at him from a midfield perspective. I'm impressed by his passing, technique, etc... from a defender's perspective. In that sense his ability won't seem out of place in midfield where as phil jones did. So I see him as a dm or cb.

660~~~
he would be a good anchor for the midfield.

661~~~
Was the only positive thing today. I'd love to see him in midfield.

662~~~
Was superb today!
Dont get it why are people questioning his positioning today, i mean i get it but i dont agree with it. His positioning was great today, saved ur asses twice with goal saving tackles/blocks and if he stayed on the pitch for 90 minutes im pretty sure we would end the day with at least one point in the bag. He left the pitch and we conceded 3 goals from that side.
Back on positioning, yes he was staying pretty narrow but thats because Spurs play with Eriksen on the left who constantly drifts inside so he needs to be narrow as our whole team moves in this situations so we can limit the space for Eriksen, Alli and other players in the pocket. Danny Rose while he maybe is their most offensive outlet on the left, he isnt TFM main responsibility - its Mata who needs to mark his man in this situations and he did well today in that aspect.

663~~~
Any news on his injury?

664~~~
From ESPN FC, for what it's worth, an "elite performance" and a 9 rating...

665~~~
Incredible athlete. He's built for the league in its current state. I think he should continue at full-back for the foreseeable future. His athleticism and powerful running are such an asset from a wide position. I know he'll likely move inside long term, but I was always confident that he could do a real job at full-back for us. You could see evidence of it at U21 level. That time he overlapped with Depay to score summed up his potential.

Two very impressive performances in a row. An assist one week and MotM the next. Shaw and Fosu-Mensah could help transform our wide play next season.

666~~~
Had Alli in his pocket. So much so that he started his cnutish behavior.

667~~~
I prefer him more central. Do you think he has a good passing ability to play as CDM? or his future lies as CB?

668~~~
CDM.

But what a great option to have in other areas.

He can tackle. just brilliant.

669~~~
Excellent game looks a real find although goes to ground a bit to much so needs to learn that side better. But looks a real gem.

670~~~
Thought he was brilliant. Such a shame he picked up that knock, any idea as to the severity?

671~~~
Would love to see him played in a similar role to what Kante does at Leicester as he's quick, decent at dribbling and a brilliant ball winner... this lad has a very bright future.

672~~~
The only positive about yesterday was him showing he's got what it takes against the best in the league. Showed no nerves and had an all round good game.

Only thing was his positioning a few times was a little wrong, tucked in a bit too much at times which let lamela nearly score. He's definitely got a bright future.

673~~~
This guy should be given an important role next season. Not rely on him but he could be a future star for United.

674~~~
Would like to see a full back partnership of him and CBJ. They both look soo comfortable in those positions.

675~~~
Next season Id like to see how he could do in a 3 man midfield as the box to box role with maybe the likes of Schneiderlin and Carrick behind, or Herrera instead of Carrick.

I'm still hoping that Shaw will be one of the fullbacks next year. Can CBJ play right side?

676~~~
I guess he could but it doesn't really make sense considering he is a very left sided player. I like Shaw alot but like Jones it just seems to be a constant battle with injuries unfortunately. I just don't see it going in the long run. Although obviously hope I'm wrong.

677~~~
I think with the way football has developed its surprising opposite footed full backs aren't more common. Inverted wingers are now the norm, so cutting in is more usual than the cross, for instance if eriksen is coming down our right side he is trying to get inside to get a shot off rather than taking it to the by line for a cross, I think it makes sense to have a left footed player at right back so he can tackle with his strongest foot, obviously there would be no advantage against conventional wingers but its easier to throw out a weaker foot to stop out a cross than use it for a well timed tackle when a player is trying to come on the inside.

678~~~
It's all to do with the defensive side of the game. It's much harder to your stronger foot in for a tackle off the opposite side. Football is such an instinctual sport that your first reaction is your stronger foot and it takes a second before you realise you should go with the other one,by then the other player is away from you. It just doesn't have any advantage.

679~~~
Seems a bit like a young Phil Jones. In terms of strengths, weaknesses and versatility.

680~~~
Same here, I think his physical attributes will benefit the team most centrally where physical domination can affect the course of the match more significantly. Having such a dominant player can allow us to field a player like Kroos and thus aid the team going forward.

681~~~
I take you missed all the bits where Mata was the only player in the right back area?

682~~~
I'd love to see him in a Box to box shuttler role in midfield next to a Carrick.

Not a LVG type of midfielder though. Think Maureen might like him there for Power (If we go that route.).


Positionally in defence he's still suspect but the potential is immense. Actually his performance at fullback was pretty akin to Jones when he first joined and we played him at RB. Similar type of player too (Though he's better on the ball.)

683~~~
in modern football it's normal to cover the space left vacant by the full back, as I said and as I recall there was only one time when it looked dangerous when Tim was too high up the pitch, also when you play double pivot with Schneiderlin and Carrick. Anyway I think it's clear to see that TFM would be more suited to a midfield role but I still found it a good performance, better than Darmian/Rojo for sure

684~~~
A back three of Mensah, Smalling, and Jones could cover a lot of ground and give our offense a lot of freedom. If Jones every got healthy that is. If only LVG had a brain and could pick the best players in their correct positions so that his silly tactics could work.

685~~~
Thats what is supposed to happen when a full back goes forward.

686~~~
What Red toad says is quite interesting. Polish commentators during the match said, that our current formation that match looked like a 352 we played before with Mata and Rojo as wingbacks. I was wondering what the feck are they on but at times it looked like that, i.e. TFM came very close to the both centrehalves while Mata had to take care of a winger (not his fullback) on the wing. It's not like he was covering for TFM as he was there with our CBs.

I'd say we were 'very fluid' formationwise and it did us no good. I do believe though that it was some kind of an alteration/tactic implemented by LVG. Even when you look at the heat maps, you'll see what I'm talking about. Rojo is far ahead on the left whereas TFM is nearly in line with the other two CBs. Mata's a bit more inwards but I assume it's due to his natural inclination not to give width and license to drift to #10 sometimes.

687~~~
So impressed with him so far, he hasn't put a foot wrong.  Even though we've had many troubles this season we certainly have a very talented group of youngsters coming through.

688~~~
Shaw is better than CBJ, however CBJ is a LCB for the youths.

If they lived up to their potential we're set for 10 years with 3/4 back line.

689~~~
He is not a FB, do people want to kill his career before it's starts? When will people ever learn. Let a player play in his natural position!

690~~~
Its LVGs fault. Most saying this probably don't know what his natural position is. LVG has come out and said hes a FB

691~~~
I agree shaw is better but I don't know about his injury situation its looking more and more like a Jones situation

692~~~
How? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

693~~~
Constant injuries Holting his development. I know the recent one was a freak accident but it just seems to keep happening

694~~~
I don't think so. The first part, especially, of last season was riddled with niggles but towards the end of that season and the start of this one it settled down and he was better than ever. Then, of course, the horror tackle came.

695~~~
We've seen it before is my point injury come back for a bit injury again. We'll see how it goes when he comes back but I wouldn't be surprised to see another injury after a couple months.

696~~~
Any news about his injury?

697~~~
news of us signing him up on long term deal is good hope this is true. Versatile player, quick and strong. Reads the game well. Those who watch youth and reserve games will no doubt agree.

Of our current batch TFM pereira and Rothwell are all excellent and stand out.

698~~~
Personally think that Mata should never be playing anywhere near the right back area. Way too defensively weak & slow. 
You didnt see any problem from that? I saw issues that you're overlooking.

699~~~
Up against payet today and carroll always puts himself up against the full backs for his headers by hanging out at the back stick as bellerin found out next week. He is potentially our most important player tonight if this is going to go well

700~~~
Strong as an ox, great physique. I don't think we'll need to sign a new RB this summer and I'm sure Tim is a typical Mourinho type of full back, he just needs a bit of positional coaching. We should concentrate our efforts on CB, RW, CM and a striker.

701~~~
He isnt bad on the ball, but still very inconsistent with it. He is very good 1 vs 1, and in all battles, but he lacks the awareness, he doesnt always seem to see who's making a run around him. Imo those are the two biggest weaknesses that should be adresses in the coming years.

702~~~
of course, he looks suspicious with his positioning, it's relatively new position for him, he can work on it but his future is in midfield

703~~~
Bit sketchy this half.

704~~~
Reminds me of Alaba.

705~~~
Beast!

706~~~
Fosu-Monstah

707~~~
Going to be one of our best players in a few years.

708~~~
Fantastic step up to the first team

709~~~
Sensational talent

710~~~
His potential is scary. Genuinely looks like he has it all.

711~~~
Future captain

712~~~
Great performance. Surely got a big future ahead of him.

713~~~
This guys good. Needs to stay in the team

714~~~
Fosu-Immensah

715~~~
He everything I hoped he will be, I really like this kid!

716~~~
Love his aggressive interceptions.

717~~~
Immense talent the potential is huge very good performance again

718~~~
Another fantastic performance from him, his reading of the game is fecking amazing for such a young age.

719~~~
Thought there were a couple of interceptions in the middle that showed what he can bring centrally.

Find it funny that despite clearly being in pain he still physically smashes everyone.

720~~~
is it me or does he not committ a lot of fouls? clean tackler of the ball

721~~~
Wonderkid.

722~~~
This lad is going to be a star, future Dutch captain if not United.

723~~~
Tackling machine.

724~~~
Was a little worried at one point when he landed awkwardly and was moving gingerly for a while, but then he went and made an excellent interception after that. Love this guy. Still a CB though for me. Him and Smalling could be a scary partnership that will last a long while.

725~~~
He doesn't look like a RB/LB but he is an absolute beast

726~~~
This kid is a beast.

727~~~
Not sold. Darmien looked like a future star during his first few games at United.

728~~~
My man of the match. He maybe dives into challenges a little to readily, but otherwise he just looks an incredibly mature and well-rounded player for such a young age. I really hope he continues to get opportunities, because to me he looks like he could become one of the best defenders/defensive players in the world if he fulfills his potential.

729~~~
He's got potential, but I think he's being a bit overrated at the moment. He's positionally suspect quite a few times. But he has all the abilities to become a top CM/CB and I really hope he fulfills his potential.

730~~~
I'm afraid his aggressive tackles will cost us several penalty's

731~~~
Err, he's 17.

732~~~
Darmian is 26.

<span style="color: #ffffff">I'll get my coat.</span>

733~~~
My bad, I got fooled by his haircut.

734~~~
Erm, given that he is naturally a CB, who has played for the U21s at CM, you would think he will be positionally suspect as a full back. The fact he made interceptions from the middle of the ground is probably the best indicator that he's yet to fully understand the role. But I don't think he's being overrated. He has a very high ceiling, but more importantly, he has the right attitude and mentality.

735~~~
I'd love to see him in CM. Think he'd be pretty good in that role.

736~~~
Future star.

737~~~
Depends on what role he is given though. Coz his passing is not great and needs working. And in the 4-2-3-1 we play, we don't really have a CDM ala The Makelele role.

738~~~
And Makelele could pass the ball, he started as a winger for Nantes.

739~~~
Yeah, but I meant what the role personified. We don't really have a proper CDM in our system. Our ball winner is expected to create chances as well.

740~~~
Love the kid already he would've been my MOTM if not for DDG.

741~~~
Well done kid. Great prospect.

742~~~
Another strong performance, especially in the 2nd half, his mentality is as impressive as his physical attributes.

743~~~
You need to be a good and accurate passer to play that role at a high level, you need to be a confident passer even when you are a water carrier. Now I don't think that Fosu Mensah has a particularly deficiency, the game is just a little bit too fast for him at the moment.

744~~~
looks a real prospect. For sheer power and physique from a young age, reminds me a bit of Micah Richards.

Hopefully he keeps developing and progressing better than Richards did.

745~~~
No, I disagree. He's more than easily adapted to more strenous facets of the game. How can he struggle in this ? I wouldn't actually say he struggles.  just feel that he's usually not very aware of his teammates positions or the runs players make. There was this one moment in the second half where he was a little tight to the CB and Carrick was wide of him, deep in our own half. With Carrick being closed down, TFM unknowingly moved into a position that made Carrick's pass back to him much more safer and efective. I use the word unknowingly, coz up until that point, TFM was was just strolling looking around at options to whom Carrick could pass it too.
Even from the few games I remember seeing him in U21s, his passing was a little inconsistent. But he can work on those things. The awareness will naturally come with more experience and game time. But I hope they develop him into one role though. I hate the idea of him becoming yet another Versatile player in our midst.

746~~~
yeah clearly he's box to box player, capable to smash anyone from the ball in the middle and bring the ball forward, the reading of the game looked much better in the second half, was in beast mode how rio would say..

747~~~
he can play anywhere. amazing kid.. great scouting from  the club

748~~~
Was very good again today, especially when you bare in mind he was up against arguably the player of the season in Payet. I would still prefer him at centre back, though. Today, again, he found himself very central, at times, and West Ham got down the sides very easily. He's still learning, though, and is definitely one for the future.

749~~~
Love him to bits,future world class player

750~~~
He's rather good.

751~~~
I'm talking about his mental clock when he is on the ball, I think that his problems of inconsistency are due to timing issues more than anything else. With experience the game is going to slow down in his head.

752~~~
Reminds me of David Alaba.

753~~~
He is more like Phil Jones IMO only with more quality on the ball.

754~~~
He looks a huge prospect for sure. Sometimes dives in to tackles so needs to learn in that respect, but he looks good on the ball along with being a tank physically. Not sure if his passing is good enough to play as a center mid, but he seems like a future center back IMO. You need those who are pretty comfortable on the ball at the back too.

755~~~
His best position is not a full back, I know, but the majority of people - such as me - are judging him on the games he has played for the first team, of which the majority of those have been at full back, where, he is being overrated.

756~~~
His tackling ability and recovery pace is phenomenal.

757~~~
he doesn't pass the ball well so he can't play in the middle argument is a bit off, he might be a bit inconsistent passer but he pulled of some great passes from what we've seen during his time in United jersey, so he showed he's got vision which is important, Alex song didnt look like a good passer either but in his last season for arsenal played some wonderful passes from deep while being beast defensively, he can play there for that reason alone that he's got with his physicality and with his defensively attributes absolute top potential, and we are not even talking about that he is great driving with the ball forward which is another important asset which our midfielders lacked over years, the last one who could do that was Anderson..

758~~~
It's good to have some strength and power at full back. I know Mourinho likes that. Would mean less games thinking, Smalling/Fellaini, who else is dominant in the air.

Tonight, made me excited about the future again.

759~~~
I think he's a better tackler too. It's not just based on style either. His tackling success at youth level is really impressive. If it was just based on style then he would pick up a lot of fouls only and that would stand out, however anyone that watches him can see he is gifted at tackling.

760~~~
Yeah possibly. Still needs to be specialized into one role though. 

Aah, yeah then you are right. But most of our full backs have been woeful anyways. Even Borthwick-Jackson has been positionally very suspect and been beaten a few times in 1 v 1s.

761~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Nailed it.

Should be a serious motivation for Jonesy in returning to form.

762~~~
Should be a serious motivation for the club to get rid of Jonesy.

763~~~
Depending on so many things that may happen or not in upcoming months... Crucial times ahead.

764~~~
Someone should check it again if he's really 18

765~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

766~~~
Of any of the youngsters introduced by LVG i think he's looks the most likely to become a first team regular. I never saw it with McNair for example when others on here raved about him. The right back spot is there for the taking.

767~~~
To be honest you are right, he's still better than our more prominent full backs (Darmian and Rojo).

768~~~
An actual beast. I dont think hes done bad where ever hes been put, whether its out wide, CB, or even midfield. Could do with two or three more like him.

Mental that hes 18. Built like a tank.

769~~~
He actually turned 17 about three months ago. It's fecking mental.

770~~~
Wikipedia says he's 18, he's 1 month older than me <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

Geboortedatum 2-1-1998 (18 jaar)
Positie Middenvelder

772~~~
Yeah, he's 18. Had a brainfart.

773~~~
Still, regardless of his age (18 lol), he looks such a smart player. He reminds me in someways of when Micah Richards broke in at City, but a smarter version in terms of his understanding and defending positions.

774~~~
He's amazing

775~~~
I don't remember such a tank playing at RB with such quality on the ball. It kind of looks wrong but it's also awesome at the same time.

776~~~
Absolutely love the kid, for all my doubts about LVG I'm very happy he's given him a chance, and he's more than snatched it. 

He's my first choice right back from now on.

777~~~
Yeah he doesn't understand the full back position well enough to have positioning sorted yet, as a midfielder or even centre back you can chase the ball as long as you have cover, at full back you leave your flank exposed. Against Watford though, the game he played CB his positioning was not an issue, he actually did phenomenally to anticipate every time Blind was going to mess up and covered for him, he will learn the position better if he keeps out wide. He just is a first team player though isn't he? a lot of these recent debut kids you know will be back with the under 21s in no time but I think he has already established himself, really is a special talent.

778~~~
Where has this kid been all season while we have been subjected to Darmian. Looks a real prospect.

779~~~
He's been a 16 year old adjusting to life in a new country at a new club.

780~~~
Where do we see him playing long term? For a guy with his physcial attributes, right back seems a bit of a waste. Guess can use it to build experience like we did with Smalling until there's a vacant spot at CB or even CM for him. Anyway what a talent he looks!

781~~~
Is he a time traveler then?

He joined nearly two years ago at 16, he's 18 now so he's been 17 most of the season and been here for over a year. If he can play now he could play 3-4 months ago.

782~~~
Would love to see him as a B2B midfielder. The guy is built like a tank.

783~~~
He never played fullback in the u21/18s so van Gaal told him to play fullback in the u21s and after a few months of that, here we are.

784~~~
The main reason I want him to become a Defensive b2b is because of RoShaun Williams and Tuanzabe who will also be coming through in the next few years with Williams a nailed on first team star. It's very possible all 3 will go on to become excellent players at the club.

785~~~
Fair enough that explains it cheers.

786~~~
Everyone knows how much LVG likes his players to have match sharpness so a lot of the young lads weren't by the fact that the u21s only played 6/7 matches before Christmas either

787~~~
Quite a bit of potential central defenders there. 

The other reason for him to play in central midfield is he has the long strides and ability to carry the ball forward very quickly. He can have a big impact carrying the ball after breaking up the play in midfield.

788~~~
Will be playing for the senior Dutch senior team by 2017. You heard it hear first.

789~~~
Has been solid and hungry since making his way into the starting line up but surely some of the comments are a bit OTT? One problem I have with him is a lot of the time the ball is passed back to him in a pressured (slow pressure too) situation he just lumps the ball up the field aimlessly.

790~~~
Micah Richards when he was young?

791~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The thing is, Timothy IS an actual beast.  I know it's early days, but we're witnessing the emergence of a ridiculous football talent.

792~~~
Christ that's flown by.

793~~~
Sometimes when you're under pressure you just have no choice but to clear the ball up the pitch.  

But if you see him with no pressure whatsoever and he just decides to lump a ball aimlessly that's indeed a problem, but one that can be sorted out fairly easily.

794~~~
Strength

795~~~
i could play for the Dutch side how shit they are and im not even dutch.....

796~~~
Don't get me wrong, I don't expect him to do an Iniesta under pressure but the past few games there's been times where he has been closed down slowly enough for him to properly pick out a pass but he lumps it.

797~~~
Well Mata isnt the ideal player but thats not Fosu Mensah's fault. When a full back pushes forward a winger, DM or CB moves in to cover.

798~~~
i see him as a future centre back but he'll get games at RB for now and is doing very well too.

i can see him making a progress just like sol campbell when he was breaking through, playing a bit on the right but eventually became a top class CB.

799~~~
It just shows the importance of athleticism, physique, and size in this league. He really adds physical presence to the side, something we have been badly missing.

800~~~
Best he sits in-front of the back four. Has the ability to read the game well and a good burst of speed when needed.... rarely looks unruffled in that position.

801~~~
I'll keep an eye on that.

802~~~
It's the Rio Ferdinand syndrome

803~~~
That's not a bad shout

804~~~
With all that talent coming through one can understand the apprehension some amongst us have with hiring Mourinho. Can he change tack this late in the game to give youth a chance and still be the winner we know him to be?

805~~~
He still eighteen, though, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that he has a few areas that need to be perfected. He is good enough to contribute positively now and this is something we can not honestly say about more established first team stars like Rojo and Darmian.

806~~~
Fixed.

807~~~
yet this shitty Dutch side beats the mighty England !!!

808~~~
Or, as the Norwegian commentator (Wikestad) said, he's built like a refrigerator. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

809~~~
No he's been doing this in the reserves all season. It's not like he's just suddenly improved or bulked up. 

I know I and others have been asking why he hasn't got more minutes. Yeah it would be odd to give a 17 year old game time but he's a rarity.

810~~~
Can i call him the Fonzz now?

811~~~
Was excellent again last night. Not been as excited about a youth talent since Pogba.

812~~~
Your preaching to the choir, I predicted well over a year ago that him, Borthwick Jackson and Axel Taunzebe would be getting first team action this year. A prediction made less impressive by Van Gaal's decision to give debuts to Kai Rooney and Jacey Carrick.

813~~~
in a friendly game.....and did i said anything about England? wow

814~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Jones is truly fecked on this forum.

815~~~
MOTM for me, he was immense.

816~~~
Currently the best choice as starter in either full back spot. He seems to have everything in his repertoire, quick, strong and composed. I think the only real question is which position he is best in.

817~~~
same here, I'd like to see him part of a 3 man midfield in the b2b role

818~~~
Agreed - Mourinho is a phenomenal manager but he was never one for trusting in youth. 

Trust in players like Fosu-Mensah who bust a gut for the team and clearly want to do well. Trust in our youth products and complement them with world class senior players if available. No point splashing millions on average/ok players like Rojo when there are players of similar levels already in the youth team.

819~~~
Mourinho is going to love him, mensah is the definition of a mourinho player. Am expecting him to be used like zouma was.

820~~~
With alot more composure.

821~~~
finger crossed

822~~~
Small ecto arms though. Does he even lift?

823~~~
and not made of sugarglass

824~~~
Honestly, I have seen no flaws to TFM's game whatsoever.  The boy is unbelievable and when he becomes a man he could easily establish himself as the greatest CB in the game.  We'll see but right now TFM's future shines as brightly as Martial's.  I'm simply at a loss for words as to how impressive he's been in his -- admittedly brief -- 3 or 4 games for us.

825~~~
TankFM...

826~~~
He's the new New Duncan Edwards.

827~~~
That can be a good comparison. I never taught about it, but Mourinho might not go for a centerback and go with a partnership of Smalling and Mensah, with Jones, Rojo and perhaps Blind providing alternative option.

I m not a fan of seeing him as a fullback, but I guess he can develop other areas of his game in that position momentarily. I rather see him because our holding midfielder like Eric Dier for Spurs.

828~~~
On FM, I play as hull city and my fans were outraged when I bought TFM <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

829~~~
Dutch press reporting that Fosu-Mensah is likely to be called up for the Netherlands next friendly matches after Ghana tried to get him to play for them

830~~~
Beat me to it.  Mou will ease him into the squad on the bench or in the CB rotation, and play him in midfield to counter a physical threat like he did against us like with Zouma vs Fellaini.

831~~~
Where do people see him ending up? I think if we played him in CM alongside Herrera that could be a good partnership. You would have the power and mobility of TFM alongside a midfielder with a bit of creativity. I think it's worth a try in an "easier" match

832~~~
I just really like him as a fullback. He's the perfect man to combat wingers in one on one duels. He gets time and space there when on the ball as well. Genuinely seems to enjoy defending as well.

833~~~
He seems to be an all action player. Bit like Phil Jones. Someone who wants to be everywhere at one time, as we saw when he played at right back, although he made someone crucial tackles and interceptions. However, in centre midfield, it would probably allow him to do more running and pressing, without leaving us to vulnerable if he's out of position (assuming the other centre mid is there to cover). That said, the lads only 18, and positional and tactical awareness is something he will learn as he continues to play at this level.

834~~~
I think its a good, easier position of him to break into the 1st team. 

But he has uncanny ability to read the game very well with exceptional the physical attributes to react and act upon. This is why his best position in a few years will be defensive midfielder or possibly a box2box midfielder as he matures.

835~~~
Surely those are exactly the attributes a top CB needs rather than a midfielder. Think Rio.

Not convinced by the lad's passing game to play CM but it can only improve with playing.

836~~~
I finally did spot the wayward pass TFM made in the Tottenham match.  About the 52nd minute...no pressure and launched a lazy ball back to Spurs' CB.  Ok, but it was only one wayward pass under no pressure.  But from what we've seen so far his game is nearly perfect and well, well beyond anything you'd reasonably expect of a teenager, especially against two very decent sides in Spurs and West Ham.  

The question is what to do with TFM in the short run.  Let's be honest...Fosu-Mensah is a significant upgrade on Darmian, who looks more and more like a squad man with every outing.  Keep playing him at RB and go ahead with a CB buy this summer.

837~~~
Feel like he'd work really well in a 3 man midfield with Schneiderlin and Herrera, lots of mobility and energy there with all three willing to put a tackle in and being able to create as well. Hopefully we'll try him in midfield once Shaw returns to full back and we can put Darmian back at RB.

838~~~
This I can actually see him being a CM. Imagine him against City being used in midfield for a Mourinhio masterclass.

839~~~
Sure but his ceiling could be further upfront. Rio was a midfielder brought further back. 

I think TFM can go the other way. And like Rio he makes things look effortless in the middle.

840~~~
His strongest ability is in his defending. He's quick to react and can read the game well, knows how to win the ball with his strength, interception and tackle. Athletic and technical gift too. He looks very good as a right back to me and we need right back at the moment. He also looks very good as a centre back but that reckless challenge always scares me of penalty or foul inside the box. I have never seen him in midfield but he can play in that role just like what SAF did to Jones in 2012/2013 box to box or ball winning midfield but with much better technical gift as a footballer than Jones. He will win everything in midfield however his passing is just not good enough for top team midfielder. To me he should play like Alaba role in Guardiola's Bayern. Play in starting eleven but doesn't stick with the same position, it looks to me that he can adapt so well in every positions. Talented!

841~~~
If we sign Renato Sanches, we could have a good midfield of 2 for the future. Mainly if TFM and Sanches fulfill their potential.

842~~~
It's interesting that there seems to be a feeling that TFM's passing might not be good enough for central midfield. I've never really seen that from him in the u18s or u21s.   He might not be Scholes or Carrick in his range of passing - he's definitely much more defensive. But he's always looked fine in midfield to me. Is say Schniederlin a much better passer? I don't think so. 

Would be fantastic to see him in there bringing some muscle and energy. We haven't had that in midfield for it must be a decade? Which is frankly beyond ridiculous.

843~~~
Maybe he can develop into Paul Ince kind ofcomplete midfielder. Not exactly Makelele and not exactly Scholesy. Somewhere in between.

844~~~
I think his passing is a little underrated, he seems a little save/nervy in possession right now which is understandable. We've seen for the under 21s. Sort of thing he's capable of:

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tpoIocK2I-8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

845~~~
I don't think that's a particularly amazing pass, it certainly benefits from poor defending and strong play from the forward. But I'm not suggesting he's incapable of passing, more that he's not very consistent at it.

846~~~
It's a pretty decent pass, not too many players can Comfortably pick that out. It's just one example. All I'm saying is don't judge him on the few games he's had for the first team, he's capable of more.

847~~~
I disagree, most professional footballers can pick that out under little pressure. Even Fellaini sometimes plays very nice passes. Doesn't make him a good passer in my book.

848~~~
Moreso in this first team, under this manager!

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Incredible.

862~~~
I've always wanted him to develop into a CB, but I have to admit, he did impress me in that 5 min cameo in midfield.

863~~~
Futsal Monster

864~~~
Wish we had two or three more of him to fill up positions in our starting lineup. Absolute beast of a player who will develop into something great, if given a chance.

865~~~
Timothy has the tools.  I'm not sure which position is best suited to him, but we do have to make sure we don't turn him into the next Phil Jones, court jester of many tricks but master of none.

866~~~
I would like to see him as a box to box Vidal type of role in midfield. He's too good to just be a cb - his attacking play is actually good and he could be a real presence in midfield.

867~~~
This. He is made for that role. Hard in his tackle and uses his body strength well. Has a good engine in him too. Right back or centre back could be a waste of his talent.

868~~~
Don't think he has the attacking game of a Vidal or passing range.

He'd be more of a Essien/Schneiderlin type shuttler whose ideally suited between a Defensive mid with passing range and a more attacking midfielder.

869~~~
Schneiderlin has passing range?

870~~~
<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>What is Fosu-Mensah's best position?</b></span>

The 18-year-old is very much the kind of "multi-functional" player so admired by Louis van Gaal after initially starting out as a schoolboy striker. Originally signed as a centre-back from Ajax, he also looked adept in a holding midfield slot for the Under-18s.

Reserves coach Warren Joyce tried him out in a no.10 role in pre-season but he produced some stunning performances at full-back for the Under-21s, before making his senior debut on the left hand side of defence as a substitute for Marcos Rojo during the 3-2 triumph over Arsenal.

A maiden first-team start at centre-back against Watford followed but he has since earned plaudits for his work in both full-back positions, including when performing on opposite flanks during the course of the Emirates FA Cup success at West Ham United in midweek.

Some feel the teenager could develop into a box-to-box midfielder due to his physique and stamina, and he admits the question about his best position in the future is a hard one to answer, particularly as he is simply enjoying his breakthrough at the moment.

<span style="font-size: 15px"><i>"It’s a difficult question," Fosu-Mensah told ManUtd.com. "I think I’ll just be keeping my options open. Centre-back or midfield, I think that is the most chance. However, as I’ve said before, wherever the manager wants me, I will play there.</i>

<i>"I had the pre-season with the Under-21s. Warren Joyce helped me very much, particularly in the aspects I was not so good at. He helped me on it and tried to make me a better player. I’m happy he has been able to do that. I played no.10 in pre-season and scored a goal from there as well so I was very happy!</i>

<i>"I think that experience helped me. As an attacking midfielder, you come into positions where you have to think and think as an attacking player as well. When you go back to being a defender, it helps you think how attackers think – about where they’re moving to and what they have to do before they receive the ball. So it definitely helps your game when you play in other positions.</i>

<i>"I think, when you’re young, it’s important you can play in as many positions as you can so, wherever the manager wants you to play, you have more experience in every role."</i></span>

Van Gaal was asked by <b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/mutv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MUTV</a></b> on Friday for his prediction as to which position will best suit Fosu-Mensah as the youngster looks to cement his place in the first-team squad.

<i><span style="font-size: 15px">"That’s difficult to say because it is also the vacancy in the team, where we need a player the most," said the boss. "You have seen this season that a lot of players have played in the full-back position because we have a lot of injuries in that position. 

"So you cannot cope with it and then you give players a chance to show their abilities. Fosu-Mensah has played in the Netherlands in the youth systems at centre-back and also in midfield. I made him play at left and right full-back because he has the qualities to play there. 

"Until now, he has shown his qualities, so I am very happy for him but, normally, players shall be seen everywhere with their position that they have played in youth. But it’s not like that, it’s about vacancies in positions."</span></i>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2016/Apr/What-is-tim-fosu-mensah-best-position-at-manchester-united.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-F...ensah-best-position-at-manchester-united.aspx</a>

871~~~
I think what he's trying to say was Schneiderlin is suit in midfield three that has a defensive midfield with passing range like Carrick and attacking mid like Iniesta. Basically a ball winning midfield. It's similar with when we have Hargreaves in between Carrick and Scholes in 2007/2008 final Champion League.

872~~~
Hargreaves played right wing in Moscow.

873~~~
So what people seem to be saying is that he's a great tackler, strong, quick and decent on the ball, but not a quality passer or exceptional defensively. How about fullback in that case?

874~~~
That would mean agreeing with LVG. Can't see it happening.

875~~~
Shifting TFM about is almost like we haven't learnt from Jones and Smalling.

876~~~
I think Smalling benefited from his positional play from playing full back, Jones though I agree with, he seemed to learn very little being constantly shifted about.

877~~~
It's such an annoying thing that Fergie used to do it seems United do it more than any other club, from Brown to O'Shea to Smalling to Jones. Hardly does a CB become world class after being shifted about as a secondary FB. Imagine if Rio and Vidic or Terry spent half their time at RB. That's the reason I feel for Marquinhos, he needs to leave.

878~~~
Sure he does, it's supposed to better them as a footballer because you're supposed to play a lot more football in other positions. Terry was such a limited player, wasn't good with the ball. Rio was but Rio also grew up playing up front and was only moved back because of the old-school way of thinking that big players are center backs. If you think Smalling is poor on the ball now imagine him worse.

Fosu-Mensah almost never played in defense before he played there for the first team. He's usually been in midfield so yesterday's substitution wasn't a bad one for him. If he wasn't being played in the back 4 he wouldn't be playing at all.

879~~~
This is difficult when we have a manager who I'm no longer convinced that he can still make players better as individuals. Remember McNair, he came through as a somewhat promising CB, a few games later LvG suggest he could be the future RB of the club. Now the lad wants a shot at the #6.

I'm all for the different positional disciplines at youth level with the view of improving the player as an individual rather than trying to forcefully add a new position to their game. Jack of all trades comes to mind. For example, having a naturally deep player like Sean Goss playing higher the pitch to help him learn a few AM attributes like getting into the box, final passes around the box, more composure in shooting etc seems much better than saying Goss is a DM and maybe he can be an AM too. A DM with an expansive skill set is much more valuable IMO than an average multi-functional player.

I just fear that a lot of potentials have not been realized due to this kind of coaching. If that makes sense.

880~~~
I think any player can get some benefit from playing in another position if they are intelligent. For example, a CB who does some time as a FB may/will/should come to appreciate the circumstances a FB finds himself in, what he [the FB] wants from his CBs and so forth. Having an understanding of the role of the players playing next to you can be very helpful.

Additionally, at this stage in his development I think the most important thing for TFM is simply getting minutes in the first team. Once he is a bit more established then absolutely, start developing him in his 'final' position, but for now I think just getting as much gametime as possible is the biggest benefit.

881~~~
We changed our formation when we were in attack and defence.

882~~~
Cheers, I didn't remember that.

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>FOSU-MENSAH COULD FOLLOW SCHWEINSTEIGER</b></span>
<b>Louis van Gaal has yet to determine the best position for Tim Fosu-Mensah and admits the Manchester United youngster could emulate Bastian Schweinsteiger's switch at Bayern Munich.</b>

United fans who have followed the Dutch defender's rise through the ranks will have seen him excel in the centre-back, full-back and central midfield positions during spells for the Under-18s, Under-21s and most recently the first team.

When asked during Thursday's press conference whether Fosu-Mensah's future could be in midfield, the manager said the options are still open for the 18-year-old and recalled how he nurtured and converted a young Schweinsteiger when he was Bayern boss.

"It is dependable on vacancies in your squad," declared van Gaal. "You have seen that players in my squad are playing in different positions than what they are used to in their former careers. It is also a little bit of luck. When there is a vacancy and you think a young player has the quality to play there, you give him the chance. If he takes the chance then that makes him already mentally a good player.

"You cannot say that a player is [just] a full-back. You can see qualities and you make a profile of positions and then you look at the qualities of a player and see if he can fit that. Can he do that, can he perform that? Maybe he shall perform it and then he sticks to that position and then he is the best of all.

"You can ask Bastian Schweinsteiger who, at Bayern Munich, played on the right side, the right wing. I made him a centre midfielder because I looked at his profile and I thought that he can better play in the middle and he enjoys it more than on the right side. I have changed a lot of positions of players."

Fosu-Mensah is just one of a number of young Reds who have impressed for the senior side this term, with Marcus Rashford being the one who has grabbed the headlines with seven goals in 13 games. Van Gaal reminded us of his track record of giving chances to budding players throughout his career.

"I have had that in all my clubs because I give youngsters the chance to do that," he insisted. "My first club was AZ Alkmaar and I was trainer-coach of the second team, I then played with five players from my second team when I was first-team coach.

"At Ajax I had Patrick Kluivert, at 18, who made the same performance as Marcus Rashford. So, I can give a lot of examples of that, it is not new! At Bayern Munich it was Thomas Muller and in Barcelona Xavi was 18 and Iniesta 17. Motta was also 17 and he is now at Paris Saint Germain. It is not strange.

"The big issue is not age. It is quality."

884~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

885~~~
I really wish someone would teach LVG the meaning of 'dependable.'

886~~~
Comparisons to Jones and Smalling's constant positional shifting don't quite stack up IMO. The thing about Jones and Smalling playing at full back (and in midfield in Jones' case) was that they were mostly unconvincing and uncomfortable there. I'm sure getting games benefited their development, but we were eager to see them get a run of games in their best positions.

For TFM, he's played RB, CB and LB for the first team, and almost everywhere on the pitch for the U18s and U21s, and he's not looked remotely unconvincing. He's looked a natural everywhere. Smalling and Jones were nailed on centre backs who just needed some games. Fosu-Mensah looks like a player who doesn't have a nailed down position and it is still wide open to consideration.

Based on what we have seen, I don't think he will be a jack of all trades, but a very good footballer who can comfortably and convincingly play in a few positions. I'm all for him to get more games where possible, though I would love to see what he can do in the centre of midfield with a bit of freedom to take the ball forward and support the attack. A solid box to box midfielder who can deputise along the back four would be a great option to have long term.

887~~~
No where in the article does he say that Tofu can follow Schweinsteiger and become a midfielder.

888~~~
What does it say about Fosu?

889~~~
Yeah Im also in favour of young players getting a bit of an education in different positions to varying degrees - I think how useful it is and how much you should do it depends on the player and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Some players are really tailor made for a specific position and moving them around is only going to knock their confidence or distract them, but for a player like TFM it is clearly going to be beneficial because he is up to it. 

In answer to:

I would say there is nothing to learn from the experience of Smalling and Jones. There is no evidence it has done either of them any harm. Any problems there have been with these two, and Jones in particular, are nothing to do with his versatility and our exploitation of that, and everything to do with his injury problems. If he had a "normal" body, and had been available for selection the amount that you would expect him to be, he would have had every chance of nailing down a particular position and becoming a great player for us there. Its all speculation whether he could have fulfilled the predictions SAF made about his ability, and whether he would have been a CB, a midfield destroyer or whatever - I expect he probably would have been a CB partner for Smalling. But there is no reason to suggest moving him around a lot damaged his chances. It is possible he would have become the new john O'Shea - truly a player without a positional home (while he was with us) but I dont think he would. 

Similarly with TFM. Maybe his versatility will come to define him and he will be moved around a lot throughout his career but I dont think he will, players usually settle into a position in the end, especially ones as talented as this kid is. I will say finally, if he did end up playing that role, it would be a shame for him personally but it could be to our advantage as a club. Having someone that versatile, who can come in and not just do a job, but do a really good job, in a variety of positions, is very useful. But it probably does inhibit a player reaching his full potential and I am sure TFM will make a position his own by becoming indispensable there in due course.

890~~~
I think if a player is putting in good performances in an "unnatural" position then that is only a good thing. A player struggling out of position isn't good for anybody, but I don't see any harm if the player does well. Many players are versatile and can handle multiple positions - Blind is a great example and he and Fosu-Mensah are both Ajax academy players. The problem with Jones and Smalling playing fullback was that they really lacked the technique and skill on the ball to be effective there, which isn't an issue with TFM. He's still only 18, there's plenty of time for him to get experience in different positions AND nail down a position too

891~~~
First time I've seen him a bit nervy, hopefully has a solid 2nd half.

892~~~
Definitely not the best half from him. He is so good at pipping in on interceptions though.

893~~~
Aye, passing a bit ropey too. Onwards and upwards in the second half hopefully.

894~~~
Down to nerves I guess.

895~~~
Ye, he has looked a bit nervous and indecivsive with his passing. I'd like to see Valencia come on for him soon.

896~~~
Rooney was shouting at him to calm down and be more composed on the ball towards the end of the half. Think he's gonna hear more of that on HT. Hopefully he starts the second and turns it around.

897~~~
CALM DOWN YOU feckER!

898~~~
Ironic.

899~~~
Whether you think it was a penalty or not (and I personally think it was) that sort of rashness needs to be ironed out of him and fast.

900~~~
Gotta feel for the lad. Hope he doesn't take the substitution to the heart too much.

901~~~
Yeah, it does (and it was).

902~~~
Wasn't a penalty, he got the ball first.

903~~~
Wasn't a penalty, but it was the correct decision to take him off.

904~~~
It was never a penalty.

905~~~
He got the ball, after ploughing through the player. Penalty all day.

He's young so you can't be too harsh but going for a scissor tackle, especially in the box, is all kinds of brainless.

906~~~
We won't see him anymore, that's how van Gaal works.

907~~~
Thought it was a great tackle to be honest. Saw he wouldn't reach the ball at first, pulled his leg back and then stretched it just in time. Too risky to do it in the penalty box though, he didn't really have to go down there at all.

908~~~
The penalty decision was correct. TFM made two attempts at a tackle. The second one was fine, but the first one he took out Barkley's standing foot.

909~~~
As usual with those threads, he was getting too much reactionary stick in the match day thread.

Not his best game, but hardly a shocker. Looked more nervous to be there in a cup semi to me, the experience will do him the world of good.

910~~~
Looked a bit nervous on his debut as well. I remember worrying he would get a second yellow in the first half as he was flying into challenges.

Clear penalty as well. He got the ball with the second challenge, but the initial contact took him right through Barkley and that's what allowed him to get the ball after.

911~~~
He didn't 'take out' his foot at all. Barkley starts flopping after the second tackle.

I can see why people will call that a pen, but in my opinion if that is a lot of tackles in the box will be, in fact most of them.

912~~~
He didn't touch Barkley with his first challenge (which he pulled out from, anyway). The only contact comes from the trailing leg, which was nowhere near enough to constitute a penalty.

913~~~
Im guessing dropped for ever.

914~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/i2kq" width="560"></iframe>

Nah, I think he he fouls Barkley on the way to making the tackle.

915~~~
And I think the first touch is minimal at best and it's only the tackle that get's the ball that takes him down. I just don't think that should be a pen.

916~~~
He look nervous, but I think that the penalty was very very harsh.

917~~~
It wasn't a penalty. 

It was the second leg that caught the player. Perhaps excessive force but he was already tackling from the ground at that stage, it wasn't as if he came though at pace with studs showing. That was the third phase of the tackle. He misses initially and then wins the ball, and then the actual contact with the player happens.

 Harsh.

Apart from that and one silly mistimed through ball that Rooney dogged him for, he did alright overall. He'll benefit from the experience.

918~~~
There is minimal contact on the first challenge, definitely not a foul and the second challenge he gets the ball first. The only thing you can call there is dangerous play for the somewhat scissors action. If that is what is being called though, then he must be booked.

919~~~
Looked very nervous today. He'll learn. Awful game overall tbh.

920~~~
Was to rash when he gave the penalty away, but other than that I thought he played well. I really like watching him carry the ball out of defence, just looks so strong and comfortable when he does it.

921~~~
A learning curve, he's made a few of those tackles and they've come off in previous games but the situation didn't warrant that degree of desperation. 

I can't complain about the penalty,.

922~~~
I don't see that it's a penalty, he makes two tackles but his first touch of anything is to the ball. His trailing leg doesn't touch Barkley until he's already taken the ball.

923~~~
He was nervous but what do you expect when our manager keeps on throwing young players in unnatural positions. I don't see the point of the substitution cos Valencia was atrocious. I hope his confidence hasn't been hit.

924~~~
Definitely not a pen for me if you watch it in slow-mo. But extremely difficult to tell from the ref POV. In real time it looks like he took out Barkley.

925~~~
Pen for me.

926~~~
I thought he was unlucky on the penalty but from the refs angle I can see why he gave it. As others have said this is one of those learning curve days.

927~~~
I hope its made very clear his substitution changes nothing for him. He looked distraught when he came off but there was nothing wrong with his tackle and he was playing well.

928~~~
Well, there was that misjudgement that led to Lukaku's 1st 1v1 with keeper as well. But I reckon it was just his nerves getting to him.

929~~~
Penalty or not, he'll need to develop his judgement to the point where he won't have to make a challenge quite like that. He has the physical tools to dominate the game. I'm sure we will see continued improvement in his team play, positioning, and composure. Very glad to have him in the squad.

930~~~
Not a penalty, but shouldn't have dived in. He'll be back soon enough, too talented not to.

931~~~
Pretty harsh people are rating him lowly for today's game. Didn't think it was a penalty

932~~~
You can't blame the referee from that angle of view for that penalty. Mensah got the ball but that's what happen when you dive in the box. Unlucky from him.

933~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

934~~~
I don't understand that. He won the ball clean and stopped the attack. The referee should see it. It was a perfect tackle.

935~~~
I kept thinking it wasn't a pen at all, but that last bit of footage pretty much shows how the referee saw it. And to the referee, it looked like a scissors tackle. I can see why it was given.

936~~~
Remember when Fletcher did that greatest tackle ever against Arsenal in the CL semi and got sent off? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> Sometimes refs are just cnuts

937~~~
Thought TFM was poor today before he gave away the peno - in fact I didn't realise it was him who gave it away.

That's not a reflection on him overall - he just had a bad game, imo. If he bounces back from this performance, more power to him

938~~~
He will learn from it,not penalty for me but he dived so sometimes it will look like a mistake.

939~~~
one of those that is easily given and actually when you look at it, if our player had been 'brought down' like that we would be screaming.

940~~~
This is my worry to. Just look at Varela.

941~~~
Gives the ref a chance to give a penalty, if he stays on his feet he pushes Barkley wider and can block the shot. He's barely 18, I'm not holding it against him, the more he plays the better.

942~~~
He so much reminds me of  a young Jones.

Not a penalty but he should have stayed on his feet. He is too quick to need to dive in as much as he does.

943~~~
LVG said last week these kids like rashford and fosu-mensah are not ready for the first team. I wouldn't be suprised if he did drop him because of one bad game because he hasn't been consistent. Doesn't mean he won't make it here though. Just has to fight for his place again. He had been outstanding at times other then today so I'm sure LVG will cut him some slack.

944~~~
He was dropped randomly for Valencia last 2 games anyway before Valencia was dropped randomly for him today.

Tough to make sense of what LVG does at Fullback tbh.

945~~~
I rated him pretty lowly, but it had nothing to do with the penalty. For me, today he spent far too much time passing the ball sideways or backwards instead of looking to be positive.

A bit more experience and he wouldn't have dived into the tackle on Barkley. He was going wide and DDG would have had the angle covered when the shot came in.

946~~~
He'll learn from it and come back stronger.

947~~~
His first touch was not the ball. Talk about biassed.

And either way, it was a stupid challenge to make in that scenario. Barkley was moving away from goal and at real speed the ref can't be sure what was touched first, but he can be sure it was a scissor tackle. No complaints from me.

Having said that i love timbo, looks like he could be a real talent. That tackle was just a mistake by a young player in his first season for the first team. Was right to be subbed but he still played pretty well overall.

948~~~
A FM player.<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

949~~~
feck sake, didn't even notice when i typed it out<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

950~~~
it wasn't a penalty, harsh decision against him but it wasn't the best judgment call for him to go diving for that tackle.

that said he's clearly very talented and he will bounce back from this.

951~~~
No chance it was a penalty. He wasn't at his best but it wasn't a horror performance at all. But it did seem as though the penalty decision killed his focus.

952~~~
Wasn't a penalty. He wasn't even that bad so I'm not sure why his rating is so low.

953~~~
Thought he was taken off because he was mentally affected by it.  Can't have him hesitating the next time when he needs to make a challenge.  Otherwise he did alright in such an occasion.

954~~~
It wasn't a penalty but it was stupid of him to go to slide tackle when he could have stayed on his feet and shielded him away from goal.

955~~~
Not really sure about the penalty, could go either way I suppose. He won the ball but had to go through the man for it. Overall he wasn't that bad though.

956~~~
I'm not sure about the penalty, really.  He did go at him twice, so that's cause for it but both players made a mash of it.  Not sure if that would've been a penalty years ago, when you actually touch someone in the box.  Nowadays you get a penalty for breathing on someone.

957~~~
His habbit of diving in needs to be cut out of him big time. That's the only concern i have with him. He will fill out others. If you look at the reply, u can see that he needed to stay on feed. The everton player was going nowhere fast.

Hopefully, big learning for him. LVG rates him of course. That's why he started him.

958~~~
Aside from the fact I don't think it was a foul, albeit I can see why the ref would see it as one, he won't be making that challenge in a year or two. It's a learning curve. It was a huge occasion and he just channelled the adrenaline in slightly the wrong direction. I'll say this, though: I prefer to see young players actually trying to do positive things on the pitch rather than those players who don't make any mistakes because they get overawed and hide away doing nothing for most of the game.

959~~~
He went down, missed the ball and the player, second slide in he scissored him and got the ball.  I've been an attacker and defender and it was a penalty every time.  

Every player, no matter what age, makes mistakes.   Look at smalling today for their goal.  Block or kick it away with the left foot that was way more favourable.  

But I do think we have one great player on our hands for sure and am not at all frustrated about that tackle as he's holding his own at 18 or so as a united full back.  Our own maldini

960~~~
This for me.

961~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

962~~~
Didnt think he was half as bad as people are making out. Obviously not his best game, but it shouldnt have been a penalty for me and he got up and down the pitch pretty well.

963~~~
What about his final ball/cross/pass? 

Does anyone else feel it needs a lot of development right now?

964~~~
I would like to see him in midfield over the last few games of the season, positionally he's very lax at right back and his instinct for the ball gets him through games.

965~~~
Didn't he give away another dangerous free kick after the penalty? That may have been why he was subbed.

Not a terrible game at all but he did look more nervy than he has done previously. It was a big call to play him.

966~~~
Indeed. Mr. Fat burner Sakho did a tackle like that on Lukaku in midweek and it was deemed great

967~~~
Bad mistake for Lukaku's early chance, quite unlucky with the penalty. Can see why the ref gave it given he didn't have the benefit of the replay mind.

968~~~
Wasnt a penalty imo.

969~~~
Seemed nervy. Shat himself for Lukaku's chance, but then again so did Carrick and he's a senior player. Think he was unlucky with the penalty.

Understandable though. Hopefully, he'll have many more occasions like this with us

970~~~
Played like an 18 year old promoted to the first team to play in a semi-final before he was ready

971~~~
Van Gaal doesn't think it's a penalty so I doubt there'll be any retribution. He's not a RB so his performance can be excused.

972~~~
Incredibly confident for his age and it was right decision to execute that tackle. If it was Vidic, he would be praised for not feckin around with the opponent.

Ref was trying hard to push Everton to the final and failed.

973~~~
I hate this whole "it wasnt a penalty, but he shouldnt tackle like that". He won the ball, I thought it was a good tackle on first view. Only excuse I give to the ref is if his view shows something different (didnt see that yet).

What really shouldnt happen is the ref giving decisions like that however.

Regardless, he did look nervy, especially giving a rash foul away on the edge of our box seconds after DDG saved the penalty. I understand why he had to be subbed. Hope he bounces back stronger from it and we see him soon.

974~~~
Speaking of Vidic he gave away a penalty in the exact same spot more or less against Villa in a League Cup final, and it was a far worse tackle.

975~~~
I don't agree. 

As soon as you tackle like that from the wrong side and wrapping your legs round a player you give away a foul 9 times out of 10. Of course, in this instance he did get the ball (I don't think thats enough to save him but I cba to argue about that on a Saturday night), but its a low percentage tackle.

Add to the fact that he didn't need to throw himself to the ground and its at best rash and at worst downright stupid.

976~~~
Yeah I get what youre saying <a class="username" data-user="46569, @NinjaFletch" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/46569/">@NinjaFletch</a> but its a sad sign for the game if thats given as a penalty (TBH, ive seen TFM make a few challenges like that and more often than not he comes away with the ball).

977~~~
Also correct me if I am wrong but it is not near impossible for Mensah to make that tackle without bringing his left leg around. It's not the normal side-on sliding tackle because he's had to adjust halfway and bring his right leg around so he can get to the ball and to maintain balance he has to bring his left leg around. I might be wrong however because it's been a fair old while since I've made a sliding tackle. A scissors tackle to me infers motion of both legs inwards at the same time, not bringing the left around after to maintain balance.

978~~~
Good memory and from what I remember Vidic had quite a difficult time in his first months here.

Time will tell more but so far very calm about Mensah's future here. Few more seasons of PL experience and he should execute that kind of tackles with eyes closed.

979~~~
I'm completely fine with that, my only worry is him going the Jones route and injuring himself putting one on someone. He's exactly the type of player we need and I don't really want to temper his natural game, he just needs to learn to pick and choose his moments better. This is what the fourth time I've seen him diving in whilst in the box (vs. Igahlo at OT, vs. Lukaku at OT, vs. Walker at WHL) and that's not to say some of them weren't necessary but if you keep doing it one day the referee will feck you over.

His raw attributes are very intriguing though and I've not really seen enough of him at youth level but I think we definitely need to iron out a few kinks positionally with the lad. I think everyone is really enjoying having a player who not only enjoys getting stuck in but manages more often than to win the ball too, watching our midfield wave Stones through time and again in the 2nd half really brings into focus how soft we are as a team and I'm starting to see a space for Mensah as a DM in the team.

980~~~
LVG relishes developing young players.

Rooney had already tried to tell TFM to take it easy in this high pressure situation.

After the pen I think LVG brought him off for his own good as well as the team's. It would have been far worse for both if he'd carried on and really done something costly in his inexperience. This will no doubt have been explained to the lad afterwards.

981~~~
Indeed, there's always that fear of decline through physical pressure and injuries but he kinda looks more like Smalling than Jones at the moment. Our training department can't screw that one up and there's a chance of having a proper defender or like you suggest, one of the strongest DM in the Premier League.

Success of bringing steel to midfield this summer may show a lot where he may play in the future.

982~~~
TFM didn't have a bad game at all today.He was unlucky for the penalty but he also did a lot of good things I was surprised when he was subbed.

983~~~
Lvg will play him next game im sure. Did the same with mcnair when he shat himself in the southampton game last season

984~~~
After the peno, was screaming at the TV for  LVG to take TFM off - not because of the penalty but, I thought he was having an absolute nightmare prior. There was one time he did brilliantly to nip in front take the ball forward and instead of a simple pass, ran into 3 players and there were a few other similar moments. It will be a big learning moment for him and a character test for when he gets his next chance - hopefully the experience players will not let him get down too much.

985~~~
van Gaal said it was a penalty.

986~~~
it was a pen. but we won. who cares.

987~~~
I see he's getting done over in the Sun by some kiss and tell slapper. Hope he isn't bothered, and that Rupert Murdoch and his scummy crew gets what's coming to them.

They can shag a goat for all I care.

Teamwork is what Louie demands from his players. <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">Coat is already outside.</span>

990~~~
Not his strongest game. I think the occasion got to him just a bit - almost as if he was trying too hard to impress. He wasn't dire, but taking him off was the right move in my opinion. Then again, I wouldn't have started him to begin with. It was a definite and clumsy penalty, in my opinion. While De Gea made a great save, it still turned the momentum in Everton's direction. He's a very bright talent and is one for the future (maybe the near future), but today was one he'll need to learn from.

991~~~
Had a good game till ref started punishing him for being a youngster and daring to play football. The decisions that were going against him rattled him more than the occasion.
I doubt some of them calls would have been made against other senior players.
Thought the manager made the right call by taking him off the firing line.

992~~~
Feel for him. But in that situation with the referee on the reverse side of that challenge he can only see the scissors motion and give it. Snap judgement and you can't rip him for it but he payed for that little hesitation lunge where he thought he was going to get the ball. He was right to pull out but the price was coming through in a full scissor motion. 

I'm not going to say it is a stone waller but from where the ref is he only see's that scissor part and blows the whistle. Not much the ref can do, TFM will learn to go ball and all and welly the ball away in one motion which will eliminate an attackers room to dive and milk a FK/pen.

993~~~
I hope he is not sold to Lyon for 2m Euros in the summer for the mistake. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

994~~~
It was one of those true 50/50 things. I have no problem with the referee giving a penalty there, but likewise I'd have had no problem with him not giving the penalty. The only thing we can ask for is consistency, where if we'd had the same thing happen in the other box the ref better bloody make the same decision. I remember a similar situation happening a month or so ago, where the ref gave a big 50/50 decision to the other team, but when we had pretty much the same thing happen down the other end later that match he refused to give us the same decision. That pissed me (and everyone else) off. But as long as they are consistent, it's fine.

After giving away the penalty it was important to see how TFM reacted. If he'd went on without it effecting him, he should not be subbed. But almost straight away he gave a stupid free kick away in a dangerous position, and it looked like it had got to him. As such it was a good decision by LVG to sub him.

Otherwise, he did some very nice things during the match, but also struggled a bit at times.

995~~~
Hopefully he responds well to the substitution and his mistake. He needs to stay on his feet. He's quick enough, so there's really no need to make tackles like that as often as he does.  

I wonder if he was told to keep it simple with his passing, because he seemed to have no confidence. Dribbling and going forward were the opposite.

996~~~
I think he played reasonably well today considering his age and the occasion. His decision-making needs to improve, both in terms of diving into challenges and getting dragged out of position, but that will come with time and experience.

As an aside, I think the penalty was very harsh. It was clear to me even without replays that he got the ball. It should have been clear from the referee's angle as well. 9 times out of 10 the referee gives the defender the benefit of the doubt in that situation.

997~~~
Hope to see him again this season. Wasn't a bad game yesterday, just wasn't the best. Really think he shouldn't be ignored from this point on, looks a cracking talent.

998~~~
It was a good tackle, nicked the ball. But, after that penalty incident, he lost his way a bit, and it was right to take him off, he's young, and will learn. It's good enough that LVG trusted him for such a big game, at Wembley.

999~~~
He wasn't that bad yesterday, and I don't think that was a penalty either.

1000~~~
Any links of it ?
At first I thought it was but need to see it again ?

1001~~~
Someone posted a video of it on here. Maybe top of this page, or previous page.

Even I didn't think it was a pen, but the angle that showed exactly what the referee saw made me realize why he gave it. So can't blame the ref for that. 
I think even van Gaal admitted it was a Penalty in his presser.

1002~~~
Didnt look a pen to me. There was very, very minor contact with the player before TFM made solid contact on the ball. The initial contact (on the player) was absolutely not enough to justify a pen though. Still from the refs POV it probably looked worse than it was.

I didnt think TFM had as bad a game as many are making out. He got up and down the pitch well and contributed. Not his best game by a long stretch, but he was far from the liability that some are saying he was.

1003~~~
He just seemed nervous which is totally understandable. His talent is obvious. Not every youngster adapts to the first team so quickly so just need to be patient with him.

1004~~~
I watched the game and whilst he was not outstanding like the other couple of games he was in, he certainly held his own and didn't have a horrid game.  He did have a couple of bad passes going forward (obviously he was having a head rush) and needs to reign in his very aggressive marking and tackling though.  Once he does that, watch out.

1005~~~
He gave the referee a decision to make, ultimately. In general, the timing of his tackling is absolutely brilliant. That he actually managed to come away with ball having missed at the first attempt was impressive in itself. 

I wouldn't worry about him in the slightest.

1006~~~
Took the player then the ball. It was a clear penalty, tad rash going in, wasn't really necessary to go sliding in. But as he's a teenager, part of a learning process.

1007~~~
"Took the player" is an exaggeration. The contact on the player was<i> very</i> minimal and not sufficient to cause the player to go down/lose their balance etc. People forget that football is (for now) a contact sport.

1008~~~
I agree but like the other guy said he gave the referee a decision to make, unfortunately it was not the correct decision. You could say he was rash an all (we slated Rafa for far less against Vardy I believe) but it's part of learning, going to ground in the box is always risky, it would have been better for him to stay on his feet and I'm sure he's know that now.

1009~~~
Cant really argue with that, although I never slated Rafael for that 'tackle' on Vardy (nor for his red card against Bayern for that matter).

1010~~~
It was one of the most stonewall looking non-penalties ever <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> At first glance it looked like there was no way it was a clean challenge, I can't really blame the referee

1011~~~
This is a freeze frame from BEFORE Fosu-Mensah touches the ball. He clearly goes through Barkley to get it.

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://abload.de/img/24-04-201613-52-08youww.jpg" src="http://abload.de/img/24-04-201613-52-08youww.jpg"/>

1012~~~
In that freeze frame he isnt making any contact with the player though. Pretty much goes against the definition of 'going through the player'.

1013~~~
Wrapping your leg around and getting the ball before making any contact with the player is anything but going through the player. The only contact he makes with Barkley before the ball is the initial slight coming together of feet.

Simply the only way you can say it is a foul is because of a dangerous scissor action. There is no going through the player because that just didn't happen.

1014~~~
I assumed the penalty was given for the scissor to be honest. It was a naive action from TFM but he's young so no one's going to hold that against him. 

I really want to keep seeing this lad involved as with experience he could be immense.

1015~~~
It wasn't a pen but he took a risk there. Gave a freekick away not long after and it was the right decision to bring him off. Just nerves, he'll have gained a lot from this.

1016~~~
Biggest game of his career to date and he was superb.Confidence was dipping a bit so yeah, the right sub at the right time

1017~~~
Hope you're being sarcastic because it shows that he clearly goes around Barkley to get a touch on the ball. Brilliant tackle

1018~~~
Wasn't a penalty imo and I thought he played well. I don't think he should be played at full back. He would be far better at CB or DM.

1019~~~
It was only for a few minutes at the end of the game but he looked very good when he was playing in CM.

1020~~~
didn't see it live as was battling the toilet queues at Wembley, but on watching it back it's an incredible decision from the ref.

You have to be sure, they tell refs, but instead he's gambled that It was a foul. All from about 1metre away, amazing.

Good job that didn't cost us.

Can't blame him for not seeing Jagielka handle it on the line, that was quite well concealed from his view.

Great chant afterwards, "let's go Fosu - Mensah" genius.

1021~~~
Maybe you used the wrong picture.

1022~~~
Anyone thinks he was nervous during the game because of this?

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/7101519/Timothy-Fosu-Mensah-fails-to-score-threesome-with-French-fancy-Eglantine-Flore-Aguilar.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepag...ith-French-fancy-Eglantine-Flore-Aguilar.html</a>

1023~~~
Didnt seem to affect Tony Martial, but he seems more experienced

1024~~~
She isnt that hot by the way, i am sure he/they can score higher.

1025~~~
He could have pretty much any girl he wants and this is what he goes for? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1026~~~
In fairness he wasn't looking for a girlfriend, he was looking for a threesome with his mate. 

I'm pretty certain she meets the standard for that.

1027~~~
Why do footballers seem so keen to have their mates in the room when they're getting their end away? It's weird as shit.

1028~~~
He made contact with Barkley well before he got the ball. Thus it is a foul, the referee was 100% correct with his decision. 
Makes no odds how slight the contact was, there was contact. TFM should have staying on his feet. I'm sure this will be part of his learning process.

1029~~~
He seemed nervous last night to me but that penalty decision was incorrect in my opinion. In saying that, I think it was the correct call to take him off.

1030~~~
Just because his foot slightly brushed him doesn't mean it's a foul for god sake. He won the ball fair and square. Yes going around him to get the ball was risky, but it was a perfectly legit tackle. The ref gambled and was pressured by the Everton fans behind the goal.

1031~~~
Contact doesn't equate to a foul or a penalty.

1032~~~
If this was the rule then we would see around a dozen penalties per game. Any sort of contact between opposing players in the box = foul...think about it a bit.

1033~~~
He slid in, his legs impeded the attackers legs, the attacker went over his legs before he made contact with the ball. It was a penalty. Had it been a perfect tackle, he'd have won the ball prior to making contact with the player. 
Is like reading a RAWK thread in here. The lad was wrong, yet there is a band defending him, like he was the victim. Go watch a slow mo reply guys this is getting embarrassing.

1034~~~
Nonsense of the highest order. Just because there is contact does not automatically mean it is a foul. The contact was not sufficient to impede the attacker or cause him to go down.

1035~~~
I thought it was a brilliant tackle.  If the ref had the benefit of TV replays, it wouldn't have been given.  He realized he is missing with the first one, stopped himself, and in mid tackle - moved into a second tackle and won the ball (when it would have been a clear chance for the opponent to score if he'd missed).  

The follow through after the second tackle was bad - and the ref probably saw that.  Gave a pen - fair enough.  But this is why football begs for technology to come in.  If the Captain (for e.g) had the ability to challenge the decision,  it could have been reversed.  Tennis and cricket have this challenge structure - why can't football.  Will give much fairer results.  Giving 1 challenge for each half to each captain won't be that big a deal - or "slow the game down".

1036~~~
You've fallen into the real of commentators and ex players commentary there.

The LAWS of the game (not rules) state:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/laws/football-11-11/law-12---fouls-and-misconduct.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thefa.com/football-rules...ball-11-11/law-12---fouls-and-misconduct.aspx</a>

It says nothing about making contact with with the ball or player first, nor does it say that the mere act of mistiming a tackle is a penalty.

1037~~~
In fairness even van gaal said he had no complaints about the penalty

1038~~~
This <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1039~~~
How exactly do you know there was not sufficient force to bring him down? Please explain how you 100% know for sure?

I'd have been pissed if United not been given a spot kick from a similar rash tackle. Watched numerous replays & he kicks his foot in the first attempt at winning the ball, before his scissor kick where he wins the ball. For me it was a penalty, for the ref it was a penalty, Mensah himself knew it was a penalty & Van Gaal didn't say anything against the decision. Obviously we're all missing something you've seen?

1040~~~
Because he hardly even touches him until the ball has already gone! That tiny brush on his foot isn't going to take him down, he had Herrera practically hanging off his back to take him down later on.

I can see why the refs given it, he's gambled that he went through Barkley to touch the ball, but that didn't happen. 

He must learn to not use the scissor action in the future though, u21s you could get away with it but prem refs hate that.

1041~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1042~~~
Do we think Tim is pretty much "done" this season now after this mistake?  Particularly as LVG has said that he is happy it was a penalty.  Back to more experienced players like Valencia and Darmian now?

1043~~~
Of course not, it was a mistake, he's a young player, things like this will happen while he's learning but that should not be a reason to put an end to his first team chances. It's not the way any manager should look at it, however if he does that it just adds more fuel to the blazing fire that's already lit. Then again he has singled out some Januzaj, Pereira and Depay I hope the same doesn't happen to Mensah. Did martial not give a penalty away earlier in the season?

1044~~~
No chance it was a penalty. This supposed "first challenge" was barely worth mentioning as contact and the in the proper tackle he got the ball. This challenges should be lauded not penalized.

1045~~~
Did he say that? I thought he said that referee brought them back into the game so I'm guessing he meant the penalty call?

1046~~~
I haven't seen a slow replay but I felt Fosu-Mensah's outstretched leg actually impeded Barkley's movement before it hooked the ball away. I thought it was a penalty after the first replay, but again I haven't seen a clearer video since.

1047~~~
Mensah's too good to end his season like that. That would only damage indisputtable confidence while still being a teenager.

To be fair, let the best player in form start the remaining games but in England this hardly counts as a penalty. Ref was quite spastic during the match and after much clearer situation with a handball since we're talking about decisions.

1048~~~
Just thinking about the way he was hauled off pretty much straightaway an the way that other youngsters have been dropped like a brick (CBJ, Januzaj, Pereira, etc)

1049~~~
For me it was one of those decisions that it's possible the ref got right technically, but only by pure luck.  In real time, there's no way he's seen that slight contact on the first attempt, it just looks like a fantastic tackle at full speed.  The ref's just panicked.

1050~~~
Can't dispute that possibility. We'll just have to live through Van Gaal's decision whatever it be like during the last two years but this ends very soon and Mensah managed to impress on time, same with CBJ who's been both dynamic and intelligent under pressure... Adnan and Pereira is still bit unexplained situation but we'll know the truth sooner than later.

1051~~~
I heard that was because they were having a private game in an U21 match, trying to win corners and then trying to score directly from the corner

1052~~~
That's one version. Beckham, Ronaldinho or Henry were also trying to score goals from corners on more than few occasions... I guess spoiled brats, lots of them.

LvG denied a chance for two goalscoring youngsters to help their team. Thankfully we have Rashford but it's not like we're rich in any type of atacking players right now. If this is really true then some risk was involved but perhaps even Fergie would do the same... we need more information on this.

1053~~~
How do you know that there was? And given that the ref cannot give a penalty unless he is sure, this is the more relevant question. Please explain how you 100% know for sure?

1054~~~
No he definitely said that he was happy with the fact that the ref gave a penalty, he was unhappy with all the other little things in the game.

1055~~~
I'm very impressed with the surging run that he made from just outside our penalty box in the second half after some quick foot work. I don't think anyone bar Martial or Rashford can do such a thing, definately not any of our CMs, Rooney and Herrera included.

1056~~~
Not a penalty for me. In that position I think he had to make a tackle and the contact that brings him down, is after he's clear the ball with his trailing leg. It was such a big decision to give but I think he had to go for it, he got the ball and any contact after was non aggressive - just the result of his body shape. I don't think you can make a tackle in that position without following through - in which case what are we actually saying? We can talk of initial positioning but you have to allow players to correct a mistake, if you want to call it that. I think he did that well. 

So it was a tough game for him but long term he will be better for it. The best mistakes to make are the ones that don't really cost you so i'm glad in some respects he's lucky.

1057~~~
I'm not the one stating there was not sufficient contact. I'm not arguing against the decision. The ref gave the penalty & Mensah didn't dispute it. That points out it was a penalty. 
When I try disproving something, then please feel free to ask how I know better than the people involved.

1058~~~
I look at him and think he could be a Viera type MF in time.

Then again, I thought Yorkie was a shit buy.

1059~~~
If you are going to dive in like that, you will give fouls and get cards at some point outside the box. And, if it is inside, that kind of shit will happen. Simple. No one ever has 100% accuracy on that kind of tackles. You are going to catch someone or someone will throw at you to make it look like a foul. He needs to stop doing it often. If a defender dive in that much, it means he is out of position often too which he was not even there. In that situation like on sat, all he has to do was just stay on ground, barkley was going nowhere from that position.

He really needs to learn how to approach the ball and the player with it at certain situation. I think he will be a tank and he will learn. No chance LVG would punish him for that though. He rates him high enough to start FA cup semi final. That and he would not be here next season. Only have to worry if the next manager will see him as a good potential player.

1060~~~
Made the preliminary Dutch squad (for friendlies albeit)

1061~~~
That's going to the Euroh nevermind..

1062~~~
Good he's on the radar.

1063~~~
The reason for his selection is primary that there's no u19 tournament and we (Netherlands) want to secure him as an international and keep him out of Ghana's hands. After these matches he'll still be able to choose Ghana, but it's less likely. We made the same mistake with Ziyech, who is better than all other Dutch no 10's at the moment.

1064~~~
Netherlands are involved  in the U19 Tournament in Germany.

1065~~~
I haven't heard him talk yet, does he have a dutch accent? hoping he starts against Norwich, could do with his physicality against Redmond.

1066~~~
Van aanholt made it. Apparently not that hard.

1067~~~
My bad, I meant the dates dont clash. The u17's are having a tournament right now.

1068~~~
Is that the strongest squad they can assemble ? So many unknown names in there.

1069~~~
I can understand why you/your country wants him now in the national team. The african teams (Especially Nigeria and Marocco) are very aggressive in the last months.
But i would like to see him in the U19 tournament.

1070~~~
Netherlands are even more desperate than us to be drafting an 18 year old with barely a handful of club appearances.

1071~~~
Ghana are trying to get him to play for them. I suspect this is why he is being picked so early.

1072~~~
That makes sense. Quite frankly he should be able to make the Netherlands squad on talent alone.

1073~~~
No, these are practice matches so it's a good way for the manager to see what the other players can do as well.

1074~~~
Where do people reckon he will play next season? I hope he starts the season at right back and locks it down as his own. The guy is such an athlete, good defender and good on the ball too. Needs a good pre season to make RB his own. Too young for cm imo

1075~~~
Yeah full back mainly for the time being.

1076~~~
I hope he gets plenty of game time next season, anywhere on the pitch. He looks like such a good prospect, and such an athlete, he can do a job anywhere.

1077~~~
Centre midfield is his future. May as well start him there now.

1078~~~
Not sure mou will start him there. He may get a few minutes in the cups or in unimportant games.

Though it may change if he gets minutes for Holland

1079~~~
If long term we are to play him in midfield, let's not mess him about by playing him at full back. 

Jones being moved position constantly didn't help his develop at all, although injuries haven't helped him either.

Fosu-Mensah could do a similar role to what Dier has done for Spurs this year.

1080~~~
I think putting him cm puts way too much pressure on him for someone so young. Put him right back and give him licence to get forward and get on the ball plenty. Idk why his future can't be as a right back anyway

1081~~~
Whoever's doing the stats (top right hand of page) forgot his assist.

1082~~~
Happy for him, but a part of me wanted him to play for Ghana <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1083~~~
Well if it helps , he's probably Ghana choose to play for Holland

1084~~~
You both are curses.

He's just got an injury that rules him out for the friendlies.

Awww. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1086~~~
Me too, definitely. Though at least this way he doesnt have to compete in the ACN.

1087~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> but no, it doesn't help <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

I don't have any gripes with the ACN, but i'm biased obviously. 

So he still probably has the option to play for Ghana? <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1088~~~
Club before country. 

I cant imagine he will choose Ghana though, he was born and brought up in the Netherlands I think? Like Welbeck in England.

1089~~~
Yeah it's probably not gonna happen, but of course I want the best players who can to play for Ghana. 

If we had a team of players who are eligible to play for Ghana and chose to (likes of Welbeck, Boateng etc) we'd be immense. Ah well, wishful thinking.

1090~~~
Weird call-up anyway, you'd expect Holland to have a few players ahead of him. What position was he supposed to play ?

1091~~~
They probably do but they must have an eye on the future after the disappointment of the current crop. Maybe it could just be a case of bring him in and give him a feel of what high-level national football is like to prepare him for the future.

1092~~~
Looks a real star to me, I'd nail to my national team too if I could.

1093~~~
What other country option did Welbeck have?

1094~~~
Ghana. Like Fosu Mensah, born and raised in Europe, of Ghanaian parents.

1095~~~
I wouldn't. Would mean we would lose him mid season every other year for the African Cup of Nations. If he goes on to become a top player for us then that would be a pain in arse.

1096~~~
With Memphis...

1097~~~
His deal also expires next season, should be looking to give him a new contract.

1098~~~
Jose gave a chance to Zouma and Varane.Two young defenders but with all the physical gifts. 

Hope it's the same with him

1099~~~
He signed a 3 year pro deal last July

1100~~~
Papers saying he's just put pen to paper to stay until 2020

1101~~~
He's declined a call-up from Netherlands to focus on being ready for pre-season. Top lad!

1104~~~
Screams CDM to me. Hope he gets a chance there.

1105~~~
I agree.

1106~~~
I agree too.  I had read great things about TFM but I couldn't believe my eyes when he got his chance.  He's got the perfect mix of athleticism, ability, tenacity and composure that could enable him to be a sensational defensive midfielder for us for a very long time.

1107~~~
I think how Mourinho handles TFM will really be one of those issues that will either vindicate him if he plays him in the eyes of the pro Mourinho fans or damn him further in the anti Mourinho fans if he leaves him in the u21s.

Hoping he does get a chance this season. And hoping Van Gaal didn't kill his confidence with subbing him off against Everton.

1108~~~

1109~~~
Special player. He'll be one of the best in the world in a couple of years.

1110~~~
Did he sign on with the Big Bang Theory show...?

1113~~~
Really cool dude, he will have a great career in football i'm sure.

1114~~~
He's the main reason why I don't see a signing for the right-back position as a priority. It's the position where he can get the most minutes under Mourinho IMO and he fits Mourinho's profile of a full-back.

1115~~~
Not sure he would get much playing time at RB with Val, Darmian, and Varela already in the mix. I see him more as a hybrid box to box DM. 

See the sequence from 2:26 on in the video two posts above yours.

1116~~~
This
I don't want to see him at RB unless we are very desperate for bodies. A central position is best suited for him and he should be rightly considered in the mix. Can't stand throwing players about to become jack of all trades.

1117~~~
I don't disagree with this but the only difference is, we don't have a good RB, which TFM could cover well. 

He's not yet good enough to be a starter at CD/CM so RB would potentially work well for all parties in my view. He's only young so it would only be for a season at RB as long term, he'll be through the middle.

1118~~~
Valencia is the first choice RB, and he will remain so this season.

1119~~~
Definately. Positionally he looked a little awkward to me playing at full back, especially on the right. He looked much more at home at centre back and in central midfield. I love the way he reads a pass and nips in between the player and the ball using his strength, reminds me a bit of Jaap Stam in that way, Just watching that video as an example he looks very comfortable wining and distributing the ball in a defensive midfield area and has great energy. I think long term he could become a top player there.

1120~~~
He is a centre back.

1121~~~
Not with his ability to go box to box - he is destined for midfielder.

1122~~~
FWIW I think you are correct in the sense that it is where he will probably be played. I personally don't think it is his best position and it would be a mistake to try and mould him into something he isn't.

1123~~~
At his age and experience, he doesn't really have one tbh. Players evolve he may be better as a CB now but could be a lot better as a CM in future for instance.
Scholes best years came as a deeper midfielder, but he started out as an attacker for instance.

EDIT: I think the club needs to also think about what is best for the squad, we seem to have a lot of young talent at CB, but a need for the type of box to box CM that TFM could become

1124~~~
I think Varela will be sold. Would be very surprised if he gets another season, which would be harsh on him, but we probably need to make decisions like that. Darmian could be on his way out as well, especially if we go for Azpilicueta. Long-term Fosu-Mensah could be become that sort of midfielder, but short-term it simply makes more sense for me to play him there. His offensive qualities would be wasted as a centre-back and as a right-back or midfielder he wouldn't need to worry as much about making mistakes. I think we will sign a central midfielder, which makes the position as crowded as the full-back positions. Eventually he will nail down a position, but I don't think his positions needs to be defined currently.

1125~~~
Trouble is, and I'm pretty sure Mourinho will recognize this immediately, is that TFM's entire ability to go forward would be squandered if he was stuck at CB or RB. This is why he would most ideally be developed and deployed as a holding-box to box hybrid. His pace, tackling ability, and ability to go forward are ideally suited for this.

1126~~~
That doesn't make any sense. Mourinho's full-backs are allowed to attack and Fosu-Mensah has shown it under van Gaal.

1127~~~
He'd be relegated to one side of the field when his strengths are in the middle.

1128~~~
Wonderful to see that he is still very down to earth. It might be odd but it was nice to watch him get emotional when his friends were speaking in that video. Stark contrast to how Memphis portrays himself with his glitz and glamour. I really do hope he gets a chance this coming season regardless of where he gets that chance. For me it doesn't matter if he is tested at RB, DM, CB or wherever so long as he gets the opportunity and grasps it. We shouldn't be focused on where he will play positionally so much as how he impacts the team. If that impact comes at RB, CM, DM, or CB then so be it, I for one will be excited and delighted for him anyway.

1129~~~
He has shown last season that it isn't a limitation for him. There's more than enough time to move him to the centre later. I'm not suggesting to do it as long as we did it with Jones or Smalling, but one season there wouldn't hurt.

1130~~~
Can't see it happening - Mourinho will want to buy his own RB which in addition to our current options there will cause a lot of congestion if he attempts to shoehorn TFM in as well.

1131~~~
If it's Azpilicueta and Fosu-Mensah gets enough time elsewhere, it'd be great. I just hope he gets enough games.

1132~~~
Memphis has a video with his childhood friends as well and talking about their friendship and how he motivates him. It doesnt say too much.

1133~~~
Pretty much sums up my view on him.....

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WCS_YXzAhq0?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1134~~~
MrMujac is Aussie?

1135~~~
I believe he was born in England and lived in Australia for a while. Not sure for how long mind.

1136~~~
Been saying it, but I can't see how people can see what Mensah was doing and want us to sign Kante. There is nothing Kante does that TFM can't do for my money, and it will take him a lot less time than before his 25th to become as good or if not, better player than Kante. Kante isn't particularly graceful, not special for me, he's physically supreme and a great ball winner a d athlete. Mensah can do that role for the first team as early as next season I think.

1137~~~
Im a big fan of both and i would sign Kante at any cost. Kante proved(kind of, performances for France make me think he really is the real deal) his class at the highest level while Timmy is still a youth player and a lot can happen to a youth player we seen it many times, talent alone is not enough. Dont get me wrong, i still think TFM will be a player for us but im just saying we can take that for granted and even if he becames that player he wont reach(if he ever reaches) Kante level in his first or second season + dont think anyone at the club is sure what is his best position and where he will end up. Big possibility that he ends like a centerback.

1138~~~
Hype surrounding him and how it affects our possible lineups/transfers is staggering to me to say the least. Sure, I understand the potential and all the excitement but some stuff is just worrying as it borders delusion. It's not like he's been a regular last season.

1139~~~
Agree with this.

1140~~~
I usually don't get caught up in hyping up teenagers but in this case its well justified imo. Haven't been this enthusiastic about a young player in ages. He has all the tools to become a world class player.

1141~~~
Mourinho will love him.

1142~~~
This. 

I'd be surprised if he gets too many games next season. Probably mainly play for the U21's or go out on loan.

1143~~~
I think he may make a breakthrough similar to Kurt Zouma under Mourinho. His versatility should make him useful in the first season but we have a lot of defensive players on the books at the minute. Will be interesting to see if many leave the club.

1144~~~
TFM will be a better player than Pogba in a couple of years. He just needs a manager with a bit of faith in youngsters.

Considering that the new Manager is already under pressure to pull tress in his 1st season I dont think he will get many chances. Probably 10mins cameos that Jose likes to give to youngsters

1145~~~
Hopefully that happens but we don't lack for numbers as it stands.

1146~~~
I'd naturally love it if he became the best he can and be part of our squad but at no point I think we should claim that we don't need, e.g. Kante, because we have TFM or place him as a starter come next season, seems too much to ask for at the moment imo.

We've had huge hopes for Januzaj and Pereira as well, didn't work too well for them sadly. Hopefully it's not the case with TFM.

1147~~~
They are completely different though?  Pogba's technique in striking a ball is absolutely unreal.  As for TFM i'd be very happy if he just established himself as a solid defensive option for us..  attacking contributions would be icing on the cake.

1148~~~
We do lack of quantity of quality in our defence.

People are overestimating our options if they think we don't need TFM next season.The likes of Rojo,Jones,Darmian or even Blind doesn't fill me with much confidence.Even further forward there's no guarantee that Morgan/Carrick will step things up.

1149~~~
TFM and Pogba are different types of player

1150~~~
True - TFM is very strong in defense, ball winning, and starting counters. Pogba is just strong all around, although far more so in attack.

1151~~~
Couldn't have put it any better!

1152~~~

1153~~~
I'm going to say this not because I don't think Fosu Mensah won't be able to do what Kante does and I'm going to say this not because I don't think Mensah won't be able to play in midfield but your comment is ridiculous for criticising anyone who wants Kante. I don't know how you can see Mensah as a player who can do Kante's job when he has never play in midfield for our first team apart from Norwich game when he came on after 85th mins. But 5 minutes performance isn't enough to confirm that Mensah can do Kante's job. He's been playing as a right back, left back, centre back more so it's obvious a lot of people will think he is a defender not a midfielder like Kante. Even in U21 he never played as a midfield. The only times he played as a midfield is when he was in our U18. Play in youth and first team are completely different level and style. So far we know that Mensah is very good defensively but having Kante isn't about his defensive contribution but also his stamina and tireless make him even more special. So it's not surprising why people want Kante in midfield.

1154~~~
I think that is a very linear way to look at it. Despite him rarely playing in midfield for us, he has still been on the football pitch, playing football, and in that time (in my opinion) he has managed to show the qualities I think we would be after in Kante. Football is very fluid, even as a full back, he has shown a number of times that he is a great tackler, and can drive with the ball, and a tireless athlete too. Much of his good work has been done centrally, despite him being listed at full back. If you watch a highlight video of his season, you would think he's played more than 5 mins centrally.

Kante is very good at what he does, but I still feel he is not a midfield great and what he brings to a team can be more easily replicated,mane Mensah has many of the tools to be able to do it. He wins most tackles, is probably as strong as Kante already, if not stronger, faster than him I think. I think he should get a shot, Kante himself has been under the radar for much of his career, and the right exposure and platform allowed him to blossom. We would likely have been dismissive of the idea of signing Kante a year ago. That is because he is no great midfielder in the traditional sense, but he has a certain skill set that can thrive in the right setting. I think Mensah does too.

1155~~~
Negatory.

1156~~~
The kids a midfielder. Mourinho will buy a CB in addition to Bailly and we will be set there. We can't squander TFM's ability to go forward by caging him into a CB or RB role. He is destined to be a box to box enforcer.

1157~~~
Top lad.

1158~~~
this

1159~~~
How can midfield who only played 5 minutes as a midfield is being compared to Kante who has done for a whole season? Being a great tackler and can drive with the ball aren't the only attributes you need to be a midfielder. There are more attributes he needs to show before he qualifies to be one of them, although I do think he can play as a midfielder but at the same I want proof not just bunch of talks. And also the tireless of Mensah when he played as a defenders and Kante as a midfielder in 442 formation are two complete different level. 
Either he will become one or no, we shouldn't compare Mensah to Kante based on video, attributes when he plays in defense, and 5 minutes of came on as a midfielder against Norwich. This is not enough for evidence. This is why I disagree with the original poster when he criticised people who want Kante. It makes sense because Mensah hasn't show us enough to be a midfielder and it's fair enough if people want Kante.

1160~~~
Debatable. Scholes had an Indian summer to his football career but young Paul Scholes as a more attacking midfielder were his best years.

He was <b><i>impressive</i></b> in a deeper position, but he was <b><i>exciting</i></b> when he played a more dynamic role. World Class in both though.

1161~~~
Great Vid, thanks

1162~~~
We've seen him play there through the youth teams.

This argument eerily reminds me of the ones made against Pogba in favor of signing Sneijder.

1163~~~
I would like to know how many of those people who said they want Kante are able to subscribe MUTV which allow them to watch our U18? Youth and professional football are two completely different style and level.

1164~~~
Personally I prefer him in midfield where he can use his energy and drive to influence the game more. When played in defence you can see him having to reign himself in and stop himself from chasing the ball but I'd like to see him unleashed in midfield and allowed to break up play and up the tempo of our midfield play

1165~~~
He hasn't signed a new contract yet no?
