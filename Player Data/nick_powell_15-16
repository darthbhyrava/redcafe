1~~~
Not sure if this is the club implying he's staying but I'm glad to know his recovery went well.

2~~~
I can't help but be excited about him, if the penny has truly dropped and he starts putting in work then he could become a top player. All the natural ability is there.

3~~~

4~~~
Must have been a brutal hamstring tear to keep him out that long. Wonder if it was a Paul O' Connell style avulsion?

5~~~
He's still got time if he wants it enough. I'm sure he can carve out a career at a yo-yo club or in the Championship whatever effort he bothers to put in but I really hope he appreciates how much better his career could be.

6~~~
Was gonna say it must have been a brutal hamstring injury. A hamstring problem that has kept him out since FEBRUARY.

It sounds encouraging though, I always felt he was a bit of a blank canvas that could be moulded into any number of roles including #10 and straight up Centre-Mid.

Hopefully he is knuckling down and getting in shape and putting in the yards, he's still younger than Lingard so he still has time on his side right now.

7~~~

Training with the squad ahead of the PSV game:

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/12299286_10153357049822746_3983845178157671891_n.jpg?oh=50a8c41f0913dcccd5925ffc476c2ac2&amp;oe=56F66D9E" src="https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/12299286_10153357049822746_3983845178157671891_n.jpg?oh=50a8c41f0913dcccd5925ffc476c2ac2&amp;oe=56F66D9E"/>

9~~~
He looked okay last night. Still has some real class on the ball, but needs a run in some team now. Not going to get it in the U21s, so wonder if there's a loan opportunity available to get back up to speed.

10~~~
would be very happy for him and us if he could get into the First team squad. He looked class what little we saw of him.

Lets hope the worst is behind him.

11~~~
He does look in great nick, physically. He's a hell of a big, strong unit. Although his ring rustiness meant there were shades of Fellaini in his performance last night. Still yong and lernin though. You can see how Van Gaal might fancy him as a player, though. He likes his number 10s to be bruisers, doesn't he?

12~~~
He's got good pace, goal threat and can go past players. Which none of our other options as number 10's can boast, with the exception of Pereira.

Is he good enough/will he be good enough to transfer those abilities to the top level? I don't think so, but I'm luckily not the guy who makes the call.

In badly need of football now though. One can only hope it's true he's worked so hard with his physique as is claimed in the propaganda piece in this thread.

13~~~
The evidence is in front of your eyes.

14~~~
I find it difficult to judge from a couple of training ground photos - particularly the stamina part - and I didn't watch the U21s.

15~~~
It looked all there last night, what was pleasing was that even at this early stage he got through his first 5-10 yards a lot quicker than he usually seems to and was willing to close down and get himself into passing lanes. Doing some dog work essentially. Was nice to see.

16~~~
That's encouraging - it's the part of his game I always felt was lacking, the understanding that he had to graft and to work really hard to prove himself.

Natural I guess - flung into the limelight as a 17 year old carrying Crewe and getting his big time move to United. He's still young in relative terms if he can pick himself up and put the hard work in. He's got the talent, as Fergie was adamant in his book about.

17~~~
Hopefully he gets to prove himself.

18~~~
Always good to see a young player back from a long term injury. But in all honesty, I doubt he's going to have a future here. Even the likes of Peraira, Wilson, Januzaj and Lingard (both last season) have been struggled to get much game time, and they're all well ahead of Powell in the pecking order.

He's still only 21 though (that actually surprised me) so I guess there's always a chance, but I'd say its pretty unlikely at this stage.

19~~~
I have lofty hopes for Powell, especially under LvG. A potential gem of a player.

20~~~
He's bulked.

21~~~
He's bigger but also looks a lot leaner. Most noticeable around his face.

22~~~
With our current injury woes am hoping he can make our bench.

23~~~
He is a No.10/AM, none of those players are and he offers significantly greater goal threat than any of those bar Wilson who I assume he will play with not instead of. He's got a long way to get back into form, after nine months out, but chances will come and if he takes them when they do there is no reason why he can't turn his career around like Lingard has done.

24~~~
I liked what we initially saw of him, was a bit disappointed when it seemed to trail off and then there were rumours of poor attitude before the injury if I recall correctly. If he kicks on, would be great.

25~~~
there was talk he may even give up football.

if he comes back strong...would be wonderful for him and us.

26~~~
No way he'll make the bench on Wednesday.Match fitness is very important for LVG and he looks very rusty last night.I would have all other 9 outfield players that started last night (and the substitute Rashford) ahead of him

The only way he'll have a future here is to go through Lingard's route - go on loan this season after fully recovered from his injury and impress on next summer Tour.

27~~~
Like his beard. Hopefully a positive omen and and a sign that he is more wiser

28~~~

29~~~
That was a tough night out for him. He's desperately trying to find rhythm and that's visible. But, what I liked about him is that he had aggression in his game. He wasn't about to let the game go by and sulk. He was running after balls and getting stuck in. That bodes well for him. 

He's always had quality. It was the lack of passion and aggression in his game that had me worried. But, this video shows a different side to him.

30~~~
Squint your eyes and watch it, and I swear it's Berbatov!. He's definitely got that relaxed languid style, but has real body strength and holds the ball up well, and his 1 touch passing is very neat. He clearly looks a little rusty there and is mistiming a few tackles, but I like that he is playing with some fire in his belly there. Will be interesting to see how he steps on from here.

31~~~
He actually shoots from outside of the box, a trait these days.

32~~~
<b>Nick Powell is continuing to work his way back to full fitness after training with Manchester United's first-team squad ahead of the Champions League clash with PSV Eindhoven.
</b>
Joyce told <b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/mutv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MUTV</a></b>: "He played 45 minutes last week [in a training game], and then 55 minutes on top of quite a hard week.

"It's a case of managing the minutes with him, just to try to get him through really and back to near full fitness. He has a way to go yet but he's worked really hard.

"He's had no signs of breaking down again and that is a pleasing aspect of it. So far, so good."

33~~~
What's his best position?  Another #10?

34~~~
Yes.

35~~~
Do you think he has the skill set to play a deaper role? Like maybe What Ander plays? I thought this was what Fergie had bought him for originally.

36~~~
I could be wrong, but I'd be surprised if he ends up being a midfielder long term. I don't think his creativity is sharp enough to be a pure #10 and his short passing doesn't appear to be his strong suit.

He's better at scoring goals than creating them. He's a great striker of the ball with both feet. He's got great technique and a good, clean shot on him. I'd expect him to continue to be a forward, either with United or elsewhere.

37~~~
Thanks for the short  analysis. Appreciated

38~~~
Given our injuries, it would be interesting if he made the bench tonight. 

Doubt it, but it would be great to see. I still have high hopes for him, and he's still very young all things considered.

39~~~
Elsewhere.

Seriously though, am I watching the same video as everyone else here? I see him lose the ball in pretty much every clip, fail to make a serious positive contribution, and get into several unnecessary tussles after an opponent takes umbrage at him persistently fouling them when he fails to control the ball. And people want him on the bench tonight?

He's consistently failed to impress both in our reserves and on loan, both in terms of his football and his attitude. He's not even a product of our own academy. What is it that he has that makes people so keen for him to succeed here? A couple of wonder-goals three and a half years ago in League 2?

40~~~
I kind of agree, he has some qualities when I have seen him, but definately havent seen anything to say he would make it in our first team.
TBH though you never know.

41~~~
True, but we also 'never know' with plenty of our own kids, who are younger, more talented and harder working. For me, harsh as it is, he's just a waste of time, money and playing time.

42~~~
I agree tbh.

43~~~
I do hope he makes it here but i dont hold out much hope.

I have a friend who was at school with him; reckons he doesn't actually like football that much and he always used to say he had been born with a gift most people would kill for, and felt he had no choice but to use it. Would certainly explain his rumoured attitude problems but doesn't bode well.

44~~~
Being English is a start. He's only 21, Lingard has only just broken into the team at 22. Not sticking up for Powell particularly, if its true his attitude has been poor then im not fussed if he stays or not. I don't expect him to make it elsewhere in the premier league if he can't make it with us but I'm all for giving the guy an opportunity, which in all honesty he probably deserves, after managing to overcome some seriously bad injuries. We're not exactly loaded with strikers either seeing though we only have Martial and Wilson at the moment (and Rooney yeah yeah).

45~~~
Replacing Mata

46~~~
Useless

47~~~
I could have swored he came on........Truth is I didn't even recognize him, I thought "Who's the tall Daley Blind?" Absolutely bizarre substitution from LvG.

48~~~
Powell's poor performance was far less surprising than LVG's decision to put him on. Bizarre.

49~~~
Well he was unlucky that Smalling got injured minutes after he came on and so we completely lost shape.

50~~~
Wasn't good enough for Leicester when they were crap last year but somehow still deemed good enough to be at United.

51~~~
Weirdest sub by LVG at United. Absolutely baffling.

52~~~
Not his fault, I mean he isnt even really fit enough for these games. Van Gaal has lost it.

53~~~
He was. He seemed to add little bit of bite to the midfield and looked to be assured in the few touches he had.

Things kind of went to shite for him Carrick had to go into defence and he was in CM with Fellaini.

54~~~
might aswell have brought on Shaw while he was at it. He's walking now isn't he

55~~~
I pissed myself when he tried a bicycle kick and fell over.

56~~~
I refuse to blame him for anything, he shouldn't have been in the squad let alone replacing Mata who was playing well.

57~~~
Up there with starting Bebe I think.

58~~~
Can't blame him or Van Gaal for this. Kid is returning after nearly a year out with injury, Van Gaal needed someone to play centrally and Mata was just not able to get going in the 2nd half so he took a gamble.

Just like he did with CBJ and Varela. Sometimes they don't all work out, with Smalling injured we went to basically punting the ball forward hoping for the best. Can't b;ame Powell for that.

Hope he takes this as a vote of confidence from LvG and kicks on

59~~~
He's clearly not match fit. Shouldn't have come on over Peirreira or Young.

60~~~
He's still getting match fit. Nice to see everyone is throwing him under the bus.

61~~~
Everyone has already written him off over the past couple years and everyone loves to be right so no doubt he'll get shit after every appearance.

62~~~
Would be nice to see him get more chances to finally make or break his Utd career

Putting him on tonight for his first game for us for years was one of the craziest things I have ever seen though

63~~~
This. Some fans on here are so strange.

64~~~
I'd rather start him than fellaini, the useless big lump

65~~~
Felt sorry for him. I don't know how much he had been playing in the reserves, but he didn't look match fit at all. The missed header looked bad, but the marking was awful - not sure why Carrick was left with two players. The substitution was the weird point - from not being good enough for the bench all season, to being relied on in our most important game of the season so far. As many said, having no midfielder after Smalling was injured didn't help either.

66~~~
I'm just glad we have him as an option.

67~~~
He has played in the last two u21 matches. Are you trying to blame him for their third goal? Because that wasn't his fault at all. He stuck to his man until the end where he tried to go for the ball, his man didn't get it, Carrick's did. On the whole our marking on all set pieces was shocking, Powell did his job though. He hasn't been on the bench all season because he has been injured, not because he wasn't good enough.

68~~~
Yeah can't blame LVG for thinning out the squad so much that there is basically no cover at all in case of a few injuries. It's not like he has had £200m to address the issue.

69~~~
The only one throwing him under the bus is Van Gaal. Bringing him on ahead of Pereira or Young only served to highlight Van Gaals self-obsessed, egotistical ways & to further add to the 'LVG brings on the youth' statistics without any real regard for Powell's development as a player.

70~~~
Not at all (sorry, had a typo in there) - as mentioned, it was the marking that was bad - I'm not sure who's man it was, as from what I can remember, someone was with Naldo, then ran off towards another player, leaving Carrick to mark two. Powell getting the header in would have prevented the goal, but he is not to blame for it.

71~~~
Is correct.

72~~~
Showed some nice touches and good controll when given the chance! Loved that he actually was shown the trust, and Louis might have plans for him in the future. We all know that he can be a hell of a player, so the way people are bashing him is sad (yet expected, considering the amounts of posters whining about literally EVERYTHING the manager does these days).

73~~~
He wasn't match fit, and didn't deserve to be thrown into the middle like that when we're desperate for goals in the most important game of our season so far. 
Hold yer judgements, he's going to get more game time to prove himself. 

Hope he does well in the crunch fixtures coming up in the month.

74~~~
Honestly I sometimes question whether people watched the same game as me. He shouldn't have come on for Mata who was still looking lively but he was hardly terrible. Had a few decent touches and a few poorer ones which you expect for someone young who's been out a while. Could have scored and tried a silly overhead kick. End of that day I thought he was ok for a short cameo but we shouldn't blame him for LVG's poor decision.

75~~~
Any idea what this is about?

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/12042494/Manchester-Uniteds-Nick-Powell-has-final-chance-to-emerge-from-gloom-in-Europa-League.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...ce-to-emerge-from-gloom-in-Europa-League.html</a>

76~~~
Complete crock of shit if you ask me. "Jorno" had a column to write, left it too late and just re-hashed the negativity around UTD to get some clicks.

Powell didn't talk to the press, so what? Obviously he was disappointed, we just got knocked out of the Champions League and he wasn't particularly inspiring in his cameo either. I wouldn't want to talk to the press either.

77~~~
He's an easy target so they picked on him.

It's nonsense but there is no accountability in that field so the journo will get away with it

78~~~
I agree on this. Pereira too.

79~~~
Andy Mitten has mentioned this in his piece for ESPN. That apart from Blind talking to Dutch media, but not British. That all the players walked past with their heads down, but most apologised for not speaking. Powell walked past and looked at them as though they were something he'd stood in. That is not a good attitude from a nothing player.

80~~~
If he finally has a chip on his shoulder then I am elated to be honest. Gutter press like we have in this country deserve no respect from professional athletes.

81~~~
Pity his talent isn't as big as his ego.

82~~~
It's a bigger pity that journalists ability to do their job doesn't match their sense of entitlement, but ho hum eh ?

83~~~
After a poor performance and a questionable start, him becoming arrogant makes you happy?

That's crazy

84~~~
Ok, let me rephrase, I'm happier he looks like he perhaps gives a shit and is effected by the result he was a part of rather than the previous assertion that he didn't particularly give a shit about his career one way or the other.

Any suggestions of "arrogance" and "ego" are complete conjecture.

85~~~
dont really see the need for him. We shouldve just kept Januzaj.

Powell has 6 months on his deal here, and i'd be suprised if he was here next season.

86~~~
From <i>Football365</i>'s Mediawatch:

<b>In great Nick</b>
Mediawatch was among the majority watching Manchester United tumbling out of the Champions League on Tuesday, open-mouthed at the sight of Nick Powell replacing Juan Mata in a must-win game. It was as bizarre as it was funny, at least for the neutral.

For <i>The Indepedent</i>’s Ian Herbert and Sam Wallace of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, however, it was Powell’s conduct off-camera which bemused them most.

‘Amid the United gloom on Tuesday night, the kindest thing you could say about Powell’s post-match behaviour as he left the stadium was that he was not set much of an example by some of his team-mates,’ begins the piece by Wallace. ‘But there can be no further mitigation for the sneering contempt with which he responded to a request for the standard post-match interview.’

Herbert describes Powell’s snubbing of the press as follows: ‘He did not grant so much as a second’s eye contact, pulling a face which said “contempt” as he walked by.’ Mediawatch can do faces for ‘sad’, ‘angry’ and ‘orgasmic’, but we’d struggle to do contempt.

Herbert laments a ‘breathtaking air of entitlement’ from Powell, a ‘superiority complex’ encouraged by the actions of his manager Louis van Gaal. But his words pale in comparison to that of Wallace.

‘In a lobby full of football reporters who have seen, in their time, some seriously bad attitudes on the other side of the cordon, Powell went straight into the all-time top 10 with that effort,’ adds the <i>Telegraph</i>’s Chief Football Writer.

The ‘all-time top 10′ of ‘seriously bad attitudes’? For pulling a face and refusing an interview after his side had just suffered elimination from the Champions League? The bastard. Mediawatch accepts that it would have been good for him to have a brief chat, but this feels a little harsh on a clearly upset kid.

Considering Powell ‘was not set much of an example by some of his team-mates,’ Mediawatch assumes they comprise the remainder of Wallace’s ‘all-time top 10 bad attitudes’ list.

87~~~
Wasn't he sent back  from one of his loans because of his bad attitude?

One of those players that think they made it just because they signed for a big club, but he'll be 22 in a couple of months and he's done feck all in his career.

88~~~
For what it's worth, I think Powell will play some part on Saturday. If only because LVG will try and make his decision to play him on Tuesday more reasonable.

89~~~
I think people are more frustrated over the fact that LvG brought on an unfit player like Powell in a must win game. There were better options on the bench.

90~~~
I don't get all the fuss. We needed a goal. He has scored goals, more than anyone else on that bench bar Young. He's fit enough for 15 minutes. Fine, it didn't work out, but choosing him over Perreira for example is hardly ridiculous.

Course, those two being your only options is a serious mindf*ck, but there you go.

91~~~
Imagine if he started him ahead of Martial.

92~~~
That's Van Gaal gone full Heel mode if he did.

93~~~
I don't get the fuss either. Just the usual Charlatans having a go at any random player to assuage their anger that we lost.

94~~~
so many still pissed he came on for Mata.

be mad with van Gaal.

95~~~
Yeh Leicester. There are differing kinds of arrogance and it seems the one Powell possesses manifests itself in the idea that he doesn't need to work that hard, turn up on time or do what he's told in training. That's why Leicester told him to sling it and there's been reports that he's been the same back at OT.

He is, by all accounts, a complete cnut with a superiority complex and not liked by anybody who comes into contact with him it seems. 

Whatever he thinks he is I firmly predict he is not going to make it.

96~~~
The most recent reports suggest that he has improved his attitude and worked very hard to get back into the picture. I don't care at all about the story that he snubbed the press - who cares? It's absolutely laughable that some are making out like it was the worst snubbing they've ever had, I can only imagine that he just walked past them and ignored them because he was angry and upset about the loss.

97~~~
I don't think Powell will make the bench.Rashford is prioritized for the crucial U19s CL fixture on Tuesday but I think he'll be back on the fold on weekend.

98~~~
For goodness sake the media are a sensitive bunch nowadays, so what Powell didn't give them a big smile & a hug, and then gleefully answer the inevitable questions about why he was brought on for Mata, and why he isn't very good.

Some of them really do need stop scrapping the barrell for a story.

What next, Martial gave them an icy glare and made one them cry?

99~~~
There is plenty to criticise us for but deep analysis over a look from an inexperienced, young player new to this and probably told not to talk to the press is a bit silly.

100~~~
You are in the wrong place. Most of the CAF doesn't understand context, only bias. They need to vent their anger on something, so why not pick the new kid? Like this one below; laughing at a youth returning from a long layoff for trying.


That's rubbish. Powell's got a good shot on him and we needed goals. If Macheda hadn't score that goal against Aston Villa, you lot would have been criticising SAF. LVG simply assessed that Powell was more of a goal threat than anyone on the bench at that time and sent him on for last 15min. It's not like he played the full 90 ahead of Mata. Your post only serves to highlight how biased you are against LVG as to twist things to fit your own agenda. 

'LVG brings on the youth' statistic. What the hell is this? Some new thing to add to the list of LVG's faults?

101~~~
it was obvious he was brought on so he could have a go from outside the box...if possible.

no reflection on Mata's performance imo.

But I did read somewhere where Powell had indicated he would quit football??

102~~~
Exactly. We don't know what went on.

It wouldn't surprise me if after realising none of the United players were going to talk, the press just threw questions at him as he was walking past. And probably not the kind of question that would make you want to stop and talk.

103~~~
From where ? Warren Joyce in the last month has been on about how well and hard he has worked over the last 10 months to get himself back to full fitness and regained focus.

104~~~
He is also good inside the box too. That article was a load of shit, he wouldn't have been training all summer to get fit if he wanted to quit football.

So journalists are now masters of reading facial expressions? At least they are good at something because they sure as shit aren't good journalism. They can join all the body language experts on here.

Heard about this 'sneer' yesterday and instantly though they'll be some good articles on that and what do you know? Here they are.

105~~~
I want him to make it with us. He looked very good when he joined us.

106~~~
Well Carrick

Great post - Some weapons about who read too many red tops with gay abandon.  

Their complaints even have the same shitty pithy lines.

107~~~
I find it difficult to believe that he's back in the fold if the problems that led to Leicester cancelling his loan are still there. It's almost inconceivable that he would be brought into the first team squad if he's consistently showing a "bad attitude".

Nothing that happened on Tuesday can, or should, be held against him. Hopefully he'll continue to improve, and eventually turn into the type of player both Dario Gradi and Sir Alex expected him to become.

108~~~
I very much doubt we were prioritizing a U19 CL game over a must win champions league game tbh.

Even U21 footy took precedence over the U19 stuff during the last round.

Powell would be ahead of Rashford that he is available.

109~~~
The lad hadn't played competitive football in over a year, yet Wilson wasn't utilised a few weeks back against Watford because he was coming back from injury and 'doesn't have the rhythm of the game'. LVG rolled the dice with Powell as he has all year with shipping out the majority of our goal threats, thus leaving himself - and the club - in this position; using Fellaini as a striker and playing the last ten mins of a must win game with an injured Smalling up front. You can call it bias against LVG if that makes you feel like a better supporter or more loyal to the club. I call it being real. LVG is self obsessed and arrogant, the sooner he's gone, the better.

110~~~
Wilson picked up a knee injury on the Friday before the game, nothing to do with match rhytm, he was injured.

Your 'brings on the youth statistics' line doesn't really make sense either as bringing on Andreas would accomplish exactly that.

111~~~
It has nothing about being a better supporter. It's a simple situation where a gamble was taken and it didn't work out.

112~~~
The issue is with taking a gamble in such a must-win occasion. Baffling that he removed proven winners in Schweinsteiger and Mata, while overlooking the match-changing Young. I have nothing against Powell I the slightest, I just think he was thrown under the bus in a move that - had it paid off - would have been lauded as Krul-sequel genius by LVG, but it didn't. He's made rash, ridiculous substitutions this past two seasons in a bid to be the footballing technician, when in reality, he's self-obsessed & only interested in his own gain.

113~~~
The 'match rhythm' is a direct quote from Van Gaal from the press conference before Wilson got injured. He had clearly said he wouldn't play due to lack of match rhythm.... Yet he throws a young guy who hasn't competitively kicked a ball in over 12months on in place into the mix in place of a World Cup & European Cup winning playmaker.

As for bringing on youth, he's already played Pereira this season, he's already got his 'tick' for that. The use of Powell is another notch in the idiosyncratic self-obsessed world of the 'philosopher'.

114~~~
There's clearly the bones of an good footballer there, he's got the natural skills and a good brain.

Not sure if he's United class, but if he's sorted out his shit (prospect of no more wages in July must sharpen his focus) all good.

Let's give him a shot

115~~~
You keep saying LVG is self-obsessed and only interested in his own gain. I don't know how you came to that conclusion.

116~~~
Think there's been an over-reaction to the substitution. 

I remember Twitter going crazy too when we brought on Borthwick-jackson only for him to nearly make a goal two secs later and do ok. Varela too impressed

Suddenly Ashley Young is the greatest full back of all time
Spare me

Mata did ok but he passed the ball straight out of play twice in a row and I can see why the manager gambled. You try things when you are desperate. Sometime they work, sometimes they don't. Powell was hardly that crap 

The same moaners are probably complaining that the club doesn't give our young players a chance. Well we saw a few the other night and I for one think this is a good thing 

The decision to keep smalling on was also lambasted. He nearly scored FFS. Armchair managers know best though

117~~~
It's just my opinion of him, in hindsight his motives, his attitude, his tactics, his man management & his 'philosophy' - to me - all seem to be geared towards benefitting him & if the club benefits, then that's a by-product.
I genuinely believe that he thinks he's bigger than the club, his constant references to past glories, his unfounded stubbornness in sticking with Rooney instead of eating his words and dropping his 'undroppable' captain. 
If you think that he really puts Utd first, then good on you... but for me it's all about LVG.

118~~~
Maybe it's the "rash, ridiculous" substitutions that are required to be a "footballing technician".

Like for like only gives you fresher legs but bringing on a different type of player will ask different questions of a tiring defence.

I believe Smalling has a groin strain but the outrage that he was kept on despite us using all our subs would make you think he was playing with a blown ACL.

119~~~
A different type of completely unproven player who hasn't had a competitive start in over 12 months?! Come on, there's being tactically savvy and then there's being obtuse.

Hard to assess the magnitude of an injury when a player is forced to play on regardless, look at Valencia against City.

120~~~
3 touches in over 20 minutes. Staggering stuff. LVG must be taking the piss with this guy.

121~~~
LVG has lost the plot I feel. Not even bringing on Young when we are so ravaged with injuries. I think he has taken his position here for granted and that seems to have rubbed off on the players. No passion. No energy. Sick and tired of this shite. First time I switched off my TV before the final whistle because I cannot bear listening to that sack of shite giving more excuses.

122~~~
Why wasn't he brought on for Mata today ?

Bizarre philosophy by LVG.

123~~~
He was brought on at striker and teams legs and composure had gone by then.

Fellaini was like our only hope of doing something and he took him off this time and not the poor mata.

Last time when Mata was playing well he took him off instead.

It's just bewildering.

124~~~
Absolute bizarre stuff. Why would you take Fellaini off then expect Nick Powell to the job Fellaini does? Feel sorry for Powell. He's being asked to do something that's just not his game.

125~~~
Strange substitutions. Against Wolfsburg he should have put Powell on for Fellaini and left Mata on. Today he should have put Powell on for Mata and kept Fellaini on. Except he did the exact opposite.

126~~~
What on earth has bought about this involvement of Powell in the first team all of a sudden.  Apart from having one injury up front and shipping out 5 attackers this summer, whilst bringing in just 1.

127~~~
Can't blame the player for being invisible when he came on. It was the wrong call to take of the main link in midfield and replace him with Powell down the guts. Kid and United never had a chance of doing anything useful at that point. If he wanted to put Powell on, he should have replaced someone like Mata

128~~~
Apparently he has bad form for hitting the bottle. Van Gaal probably sorting him out with some appearance money. What a man, what a manager!!

<span style="color: #ffffff">not serious</span>

129~~~
I'd love to know the reasoning behind bringing Powell on twice as a sub when he's not played for us for over a year. Van Gaal expecting a notable contribution is just ridiculous.

130~~~
ok my logic says that LVG has used all his options for creating and isn't working, so he is using Powell as dark horse to produce something we havnt seen before

131~~~
especially when Van Gaal always states how players need to be ready condition wise... but some start no matter what ie Rooney or now Powell because he actually doesnt have anyone else which is obviously only his mistake he didnt bring a striker in, wouldnt mind rashford but LVG thinks hes good as widemand for him.. Powell doesnt look like any good in the air to justify him being no9 all of a sudden. I understand he spent some time there in wigan on loan and didnt do badly but this is too much for me..

And mabye its just giggs idea to play him

132~~~
Well he is going to continue having not played for over a year if you don't sub him on. How else is he going to change that he hasn't played in over a year?

133~~~
A loan? Or perhaps don't bring him on when we're struggling, bring him on in more comfortable games or less important ones?

134~~~
When was the last time we even had one of those?

135~~~
Loan out even more options? We're already fecked with all the injuries which is forcing him to play in the first place. Those games don't exist.

136~~~
You're right, but then he doesn't play. Unless he has the quality to impose himself in games like this, he shouldn't be getting any game time in them.

137~~~
They existed in the Carling Cup but he chose not to play him. And even in the league United should have games where we are a few goals up, coasting and can afford to play him. That they don't exist is Van Gaal's fault, not unavoidable circumstances.

138~~~
Powell hadn't returned for the Carling Cup games. That isn't Powell's fault, so because the rest of the team can't finish games off Powell should just never get to play?

139~~~
He must be hot sauce in training. <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

140~~~
I'm sorry, but what's the point?

141~~~
LVG is trying to find him a new club like Valdes.

142~~~
Bringing him on for 20 minute cameo appearances isn't going to change anything is it? Especially given it's in games in which we're struggling.

143~~~
He may as well retire so.

144~~~
Strange sub again by LvG. Powell didn't really get involved either.

145~~~
It's kind of like on FIFA when you remember you have a generic youth player in your squad that you haven't played for three seasons that you've forgotten about, so you decide to give him some game-time again for a laugh.

146~~~
I'm baffled as to the suddenness of his return and have been annoyed at decisions to send him on for the players he has replaced. I'm finding myself often almost lamenting Powell himself for it. Then I remember he's a kid we should be getting behind and hoping he makes it. LVG is doing him no favours throwing him on the way he is. It can't be doing his confidence any good feeling almost like a scapegoat or that we don't want to see him coming on. When in fact we are just baffled by what the hell LVG is playing at.

147~~~
Its been mentioned, but LVG talks about match rhthym a lot and thats why some players arent thrown in. But then to throw in Powell in arguably our biggest match so far (Wolfsburg) was madness.

Then to put him on for Fellaini (who was actually playing well it looked like and getting into positions that were awkward for the defenders) did Powell no favours. I want Powell to succeed but wasnt he injured, whats caused him to jump ahead of the likes of Young? 

Its like LVG is hoping for a "Krul at the world cup" moment.

148~~~
This. He did it a lot earlier on in his tenure here. Random players would inexplicably get game time to see if they were up to it or not, and then a few weeks later they would be gone. January is just around the corner and i'll bet money Powell will be up for sale.

149~~~
A must win CL game and van Gaal thinks we should play Powell to get a few extra hundred thousand? That is certainly what happened.

150~~~
How did you get that conclusion from what <a class="username" data-user="51833, @Bojan11" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/51833/">@Bojan11</a> and I said? LVG wants to see if he's up to it or not before the January window opens, and this is the first chance he's had. It's looking like he's not, so he will be out. The extra game time just helps attract buyers.

151~~~
He needed a striker and currently Powell is it. The move was to get Martial wide and play someone else up front. It wasn't a bad move in theory. The problem was the summer transfer window leaving the club so ridiculously short of forward options that you have to throw Powell into an important role in really crucial games. It really was negligent and will cost the club dearly this season.

152~~~
Well Bojan11 saying he is trying to find him a new club insinuates he has already decided to sell him. A must win Champions league match still isn't a game a manager uses to see if someone is up to it. The more likely reason is van Gaal looked at the bench and saw Powell is the only forward and would offer the most goal threat.

153~~~
How many touches does he have in two games? Surely under 5?

154~~~
Is he still driving that Corsa? Or has he upgraded?

155~~~
According to republik of mancunia, against Wolfsburg he completed only four passes - one of which was in the final third, and against Bournemouth he complete one of two attempted passed, neither of which were in the final third. He had no shots, no crosses, no tackles, nothing else except those six attempted passes.

156~~~
The well-spring for incoherent wailing and much gnashing of teeth.

157~~~
I think he should be out on loan. He does need game time, but with us at the moment. Can we recall Wilson in Jan, and send Powell out instead?

158~~~
Fourfourtwo have his CL stats as 4 completed passes out of 12 attempts, 3 shots of which 2 were blocked and one miles off target, and he won 2 headers so I make that at least 17 touches against Wolfsburg.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/5-2015/matches/832631/player-stats/82205/OVERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor#:iKwaQwpNdnL2uA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...VERALL_02#tabs-wrapper-anchor#:iKwaQwpNdnL2uA</a>

159~~~
At least 20 according to my maths. Minimum 17 (4/12 completed passes, 3 shots and 2 headers won) in CL and minimum 3 (1/2 completed passes + 1 header won) in PL. Click on links for details.

160~~~
Judging by his antics at Leicester it seems he thinks he's too good to be out on loan

161~~~
When we send him out on loan he just gets pissed up and irritates people.

162~~~
Powell is the best choice for a goal threat substitution among the choices LVG currently have.It didn't work out but I'm amazed at the abuse Nick received.

That saying I don't really expect him to make it.

163~~~
Powell was absolute class tonight in the 6-1 reserves win, really hoping he can take some of they ability over to the first team,  he certainly has the talent to make it here.

164~~~
Play him up front and move Martial to the left. See how he does for a full game instead of 5 minutes.

165~~~
so he is fast gaining his fitness. excellent.

166~~~
Wayne Rooney doesn't even need a loan to do that.

167~~~
Yup, worked his arse off too, really had the bit between his teeth, he looks twice the player to the one who played in the Norwich reserve match just a few weeks ago. Genuinely the most polished performance I've seen at this level for a long while.

168~~~
when he first came to us, I was very impressed with what I saw of him. Hopefulyy he will be a key player for us.

169~~~
Where did he play?

170~~~
There's a player in there but again some of these lads need a run of games that I just don't feel he's going to get unless he has an outstanding cameo for first team and then continues to build on that. Not easy for a young player as we've seen on many occasions....

171~~~
Up top, his movement for his second was that of a class striker too, definitely looks like he's beginning to really understand the role.

172~~~
The one gripe with Powell before he disappeared on loan was that he seemed to drift through games and didn't really apply himself.

Ignoring the ridiculous sub appearances where he was doomed to fail in the roles he was given, he's looking like a man with a point to prove. He's suddenly got that fire in his belly. He got injured playing for the reserves a couple of years ago, right before Adnan broke through, and he was the best player every game prior to that. Then Adnan sort of picked up that mantle in Powells absence. The talent is there and it looks like the hunger is suddenly there. I really hope he kicks on.

Like I said though, I'm not critical of his recent sub appearances at all. He is being brought on and playing as a target man on the last defender, it's just ridiculous.

173~~~
In the game against Norwich reserves he was flying into challenges and looking so pumped up, at the time it seemed like he was just being a bit of a dick but now it does seem like that hunger and aggression similar to Rooney in his younger years. I know a lad who played that night for Norwich and they didn't want to go near him. Now he's finding a bit of sharpness too he could genuinely make an impact on the first team in the near future.

174~~~
If he works out or not, he is exactly the type of player LVG likes to play at number 10

175~~~
He definitely has plenty of talent.

Dunno,  where he is totally shit and what not theory comes from.

176~~~
Glad that Powell is starting to get match fit, hopefully he'll kick on and take his chance in the first team.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-u21s-6-1-10600336" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.manchestereveningnews.co...ball-news/manchester-united-u21s-6-1-10600336</a>

177~~~
the problem with Powell was always his attitude, yesterday he showed he can chase the ball even at the last minute of the game, long may it continue and he can find a decent club for him. While I dont think he wouldnt do any worse on for fellaini, maybe its a bit too late for him to make it here, we will see if he gets any more chances with that big injury list.. 

BTW I absloutely wouldn't mind him there up top or anywhere for rooney, saying this, he would be good enough for us by that standard..

178~~~
He really is, a goalscorer with strength to hold onto the ball in tight spaces, has a fair bit of vision about him too.

179~~~
His talent was obvious, and I always criticised his attitude. Seems to be over it, I hoped the lad would understand the seriousness of the situation and that his contract is up soon. Finally starts to show what he is made of, love it. Keep it up Nicky boy. A few good games here and there pushing his fitness levels, I can see him making the next steps quite quickly if he shows that new determination and hunger regularly

180~~~
Is there a compilation of his performance from yesterday?

181~~~
The way things have been going I wouldn't be surprised if he starts vs Norwich <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

182~~~
He'll definitely come on for the best performing player after 70 minutes.

183~~~
Well we have a trend of that yeh. I think LVG might be tempted to start him in the 10 role or at the very least give him the second half dependent on how we're doing.

184~~~
i think he'll be sold in january. Out of nowhere yes, but a gut feeling.

185~~~
I've noticed LVG gives some random players time just before shipping them out. Might be another one here.

186~~~
His contract is up in June next year anyway.

187~~~
People think he gave him a chance in our vital CL game just to see if he cuts it or else he will be sold? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Wow, Louis is crazy, but not that stupid.

188~~~
He is in last chance saloon that is why, even he knows that.

189~~~
Not according to most!

190~~~
here is a link to his best bits v Bounremouth <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

<a class="externalLink" href="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRkpUVZ4w_GsthvMnKtjjjKTGyPr_eVor7ETTdGYeN1qxViCrw4Tw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/...w_GsthvMnKtjjjKTGyPr_eVor7ETTdGYeN1qxViCrw4Tw</a>

191~~~
I voted Powell MOTM for the Bournemouth game - it was a protest vote if I'm honest.

192~~~
Give them some visibility to get people to bid. FM style.

193~~~
Nah, he's only 21, he has plenty of time. Seemed like a real talent a couple of years ago, wonder if he might be one of those players who sort of fly in under the radar.

194~~~
Works every time <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

195~~~
the big question is his attitude, I dont think he can maintain that level of concentration to succeed here but who knows

196~~~
He is out of contract in the summer. Everton want him it looks like.

If he is on the way back we better tie him down.

197~~~
Would be a mistake to let him go so early. Everton would be a good club for him, but i hope we have faith in him.

198~~~
We can always send him on loan there next season.

199~~~
haha, yes probably.

200~~~
According to this guy at Bleacher report, he is being considered to start the Norwich game. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2599723-insider-buzz-manchester-uniteds-nick-powell-pushing-for-starting-role?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=programming-UK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/...m_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=programming-UK</a>

Not sure how true it is but if it's true it would be a quick rise.

201~~~
Januzaj was first choice until he was shipped out. I wouldn't read too much into Powell's recent inclusions.

202~~~
He liked a tweet criticizing Van Gaal for spending too much money. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://metro.co.uk/2015/12/20/nick-powell-likes-article-on-twitter-that-says-louis-van-gaal-has-wasted-money-at-manchester-united-5576325/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://metro.co.uk/2015/12/20/nick-...as-wasted-money-at-manchester-united-5576325/</a>

203~~~
ffs

204~~~
And then he posted a tweet saying he didnt mean to like the tweet.

205~~~
He said he touched the like button accidentally. Pretty easy to do on a touch screen device.

206~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

207~~~
Comedy gold.

208~~~
Can't even operate Twitter properly, sell him.

209~~~
How ungrateful is he? Thanks to LVG he'll be able to tell his grandchildren about his one and only CL appearance.

210~~~
He got one under Fergie against Galatasaray, no?

211~~~
Hmm, make that two then!

212~~~
Did he win a lottery or something ?

213~~~
He got 3 under SAF 2 years ago already including a start.

214~~~
Looks like he wants to go out on loan so that he can prove that he is worth a new contract in the Summer:

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2016/01/04/report-preston-north-end-lead-six-club-chase-for-manchester-unit/?" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2016/01/0...end-lead-six-club-chase-for-manchester-unit/?</a>

215~~~
Why the championship though? This is a player with CL and Europa league experience. Surely he can attract a PL club, even Villa! I don't feel he's progressing as well as he should

216~~~
Because he's not very good. 
I think he'll play the bulk of his future career games in the Championship.

217~~~
He's just disappeared after randomly appearing for a week or two.

218~~~
I believe that was a fever dream.

219~~~
He probably impressed in training after being told:

"<i>Nick, when did you last read your contract?"
"When I signed it, boss"
"Well it ends in the summer"
"feck"
</i>
Kick up the arse and with us short on players why not see what he can do. Ultimately it's more or less over for him here - injuries haven't helped but at the very least it's made him relevant again and some clubs as we're seeing now are taking notice of him.

220~~~
Can't believe we time after time miss out on players like Ramsey, Alli etc and end up with daft feckers like Jones and Powell.

221~~~
Philosophy.

222~~~
Ramsey rejected us though. You are wrong that we missed out, we actively went for him. And time will tell if Alli can make the grade at a top club.

223~~~
Pretty sure that was just a shop window

224~~~
please tell me we are renewing his deal.....

225~~~
Then van Gaal is an idiot.

226~~~
Do people have anything decent to say?The last page is shocking.

Powell didn't play yesterday probably because he's about to go on loan.Not exactly a mystery.

227~~~
Thought I saw him in Lidls today.

Looked to me he was in charge of the fresh veg section. Sneer on him.

228~~~

230~~~
Makes sense.
The Championship is his level, and he'll probably spend most of his career there.

Sir Alex's mission: <i>'make up for missing out on Aaron Ramsey'</i> failed.

231~~~
LvG put him on in a must win CL game, and some weeks later sends him on loan to Hull for the remainder of his contract.

I really don't think LvG is right for this job

232~~~
If he plays well he gets an extension, if not we let him go. Still has the talent to make it imo.

233~~~
I thought he'd already gone on loan to Forest?

234~~~
It was never finalized and was held up by Nick picking up a little injury.

235~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

236~~~
Probably the smartest thing he's done in years to be fair.

237~~~
The just said on SSN that he may be recalled. FFS <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

238~~~
Europa League is beneath him anyway... It's CL or nothing for good ol' Nicky.

239~~~
I bet he has a career mode as United on FIFA, and was shocked when it came up saying, "Nick Powell demands transfer request", since even he'd forgotten he plays for us.

240~~~
He's just too laid back. He doesn't have the drive and aggression to make it at the top. The talent has always been there. The application hasn't. He enjoys his banter and probably enjoys his time away from the training ground too much.

Ferguson alluded to his laid back ways in his book.

What annoys me is that he could have been our Dele Ali.

241~~~
Clearly so we can put him in the shop window for the Chinese.

242~~~
What a fecking muppet <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Kinda also disrespectful to his teammates and to the club if you ask me.

243~~~
Can't fault his decision-making with that one.

244~~~
Starting against Arsenal tonight.

245~~~
Today <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

246~~~
In my defence it's 8:40 pm here <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

247~~~
Has he been any good?

248~~~
He's been alright. Some nice touches and one good through ball but nothing else in attack. Lost the ball a few times, as well. He's done well defensively, to be fair. Some good tackles. Can't say he stands out in that Hull team though, to be honest.

249~~~
He's actually impressed me today. Looks cut amongst the rest of the Hull side. Holding the ball really well, put in some good passes. 

Made some very good tackles too. Tracked back many times right into Hull's box. 

He is such an enigma.

250~~~
Thanks, had hoped this would be a good platform him. Still believe in his talent, and it all seems like he's getting his head sorted.

251~~~
Shit

252~~~
Agree with everything except the parts in bold. He's always been and will forever be a championship level player. If he's motivated enough, he could make a decent career with the likes of Hull, but that's about it.

253~~~
I think Powell is quality but lacks a bit of attitude, probably a bit like Januzaj.

254~~~
Agreed.

255~~~
Powell has the talent to be a good Premier League player. He was excellent at Crewe, did okay for us in his debut season (limited game time) and had a very good loan move at Wigan where he was even scoring goals in The Europa League. Then he derailed the following season.

His mistake was joining United. He should have joined a club that would have given him regular games.

Dele Ali would have been used sparingly at most other clubs. Pochettino is a rare breed of manager. He got his chance and took it, his confidence grew and now he's playing to a high level as a result of his first team exposure.

256~~~
seen only 40 minutes but he looked like working hard defensively, tracking back, dont have much else to add.. but that's a good observation for me as he never really looked like he cared defensively.. maybe apart his last game for U21's

257~~~
All I remember about him was his debut were he scored a cracker of a shot outside the box i think it was

258~~~
Ah vs Wigan. Those were the Fergie days <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Buttner scored that day too!

259~~~
That was a nice goal, what was he 17 or 18 then? He really did look big and powerful for his age as well. I think he has the talent, maybe lacking in the attitude and has a case of the "I've-made-it-at-United" about him. Does anyone else get the feeling that Giggs was behind the bizarre return to the first team? I think Giggsy rates him.

260~~~
He's time here is done(Unless Giggs was made manager)

He's decent, but nowhere near United standard. Sadly you can say that about many of our other players too.

261~~~
He looked talented when he started, unfortunately for him injuries and the managerial situation at the club has worked to his detriment. 

Isn't his contract up this summer?

262~~~
he's always looked very talented to me but his apparent attitude issues, injuries and our own sad state means he's pretty much gone in the summer.

263~~~

264~~~
He's clearly a dick and that's the problem not his ability. He's developed a reputation for being lazy as well as thinking he's far better than he actually is and if true that's why he won't make it.

If it's also true that Giggs is a fan then add that to the reasons he shouldn't get the managers job.

265~~~
It's actually very possible that it's both. He's a 'dick <i>and </i>doesn't have the ability for a top team.

Looked really headless to me. Whenever he played deep and tried to tone it down and play a controlling role, he was pointless and served no useful purpose. And whenever he played his natural roaming game, he looked headless and scrappy. To put it into perspective - Jonjo Shelvey had/has more talent.

Sir Alex's attempt at 'Aaron Ramsey II' failed, unfortunately. He has a good shot on him, though.

I'm not sure you can take much from that Hull performance attacking wise. At the majority of points they had 10 men behind the ball and were looking to frustrate Arsenal, slow them down and then hit them on the break. The positive was he was doing as he was told, something; I imagine, has sparked this sudden "resurgence". I put in quotation marks as it's only from written off as a player and retiring, to now possibly being part of Uniteds future plans.  He's at the best club he could be at for his development. Hull are the front runners for the league and Bruce has openly said he's going to use him a lot. Will be watching the championship for him the rest of the season.

Not sure why you've made that comparison and or why you think his development is over. He's 21!

267~~~
What comparison? I didn't make a comparison. I've always felt Sir Alex signed him (and wanted to turn him into a centre midfielder) partly because he regretted not doing more sign Aaron Ramsey. Just my opinion.

And who said his development was over? Did I even mention 'development' in my post? Whether he's still going to develop or not, I don't think he'll be a very good player. I'll be surprised if he plays half his career games in the Premier League, or manages to hold down a regular spot in a top half Premier League team. I don't have to rate him just because he's young and plays for United. 
And I don't subscribe to the idea that every young player (talented or not) will improve loads as they get older.

268~~~
I remember some talk when he signed that some of the players were left a bit bemused and didn't see much in him.

269~~~
I was actually excited when we signed Powell as he had scored some absolute crackers for Crewe and I recall that Chelsea were linked with him too. He has been pretty disasterous though and I have seen nothing to suggest that he will make it at any decent level, let alone with us.

270~~~
Fair enough, that's the reason for the comparison then. If you call someone "Aaron Ramsey II", there's usually some comparable, no matter how tenuous.

Well I mis read your second part as "He <i>had </i>a good shot on him, though", although I think that makes more sense if you did mean that. The past tense I thought you implied he's not going to get any better, but again that's my misreading if you meant has. With regards to be a premier league player, he's at a club that wants him permanently and that will most likely be in the premier league next season.

At what point did <i>I </i>say you had to rate him because he's young and plays for United?! I also don't subscribe to that idea, but following his development since he joined, this season he looks to have actually put work in to improve and knuckled down.

Nick Powell: 'I was lost at Manchester United - Hull City is a new challenge'

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Nick-Powell-lost-Manchester-United-Hull-City-new/story-28770948-detail/story.html#ixzz414Pv7ciE" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Nick...tory-28770948-detail/story.html#ixzz414Pv7ciE</a>

272~~~
Saying the right things. I hope its not babbel and he has actually started to try and work, to reach his potential.

273~~~
Looks good so far against Arsenal.

274~~~
We sign so many average players, it is unreal.

275~~~
Remember that fun week where he suddenly became a valuable member of the first-team? Good times.

276~~~
Injuries and perhaps lack of real desire to a top talent cost him dearly. He definitely had the raw skills to become a fantastic player, but I think he's struggled to adapt to being the small fish in a big pond.

277~~~
He's quite a crock.

Injuries have damned him more than any other issue. He's spent almost half or more of his every season and off seasons as well since joining us injured.

278~~~

279~~~
What are FIFA jokes about?

280~~~
He got asked if he watched one of the games earlier in the season but he forgot about it and was actually playing FIFA, twitter does not let you forget that kind of thing.

281~~~
He's deal runs out this Summer right?

It's been a poor signing all round.

282~~~
Released

283~~~
Turns out he didn't know the drill after all.

284~~~
What a waste!

285~~~
Aside from the Van Gaal selection farce the only thing I can remember him doing was scoring a good long-range effort in his first season. Amazing how many 'top rated' youngsters turn out to be pretty wank. 

It's why I can't help rolling my eyes when people tell me about some 'hot prospect' no ones ever heard of.

286~~~
Keep clearing out the deadwood Jose

He'll always have this.

288~~~
Thank goodness.

HE CAME ON TO SAVE OUR CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEASON!!!!!!!

290~~~
What's the lad's deal? He played 5 games for Hull last season, he played 3 games for Leicester the season before. Has he been injured, or just not good enough to get picked?

He looked very raw when we signed him. His strength was striking the ball. Has a great shot on him with both feet. His passing and general play always looked ropey.

Still, never forget how utterly delighted he looked to sign for United

<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://redmancunian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/nick-powell-signing-620x300.jpg" src="http://redmancunian.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/nick-powell-signing-620x300.jpg"/>

Probably doesn't even rank in his top 50 best days of his life.

291~~~
He's been a crock. 3 long term injuries in last 3 seasons IIRC. Missed 3 pre seasons with some injury or the other as well including Moyes' and LVG's first.

Even when LVG stupidly threw him on in the CL and other games he was coming back from a nasty hamstring injury after about a year almost i think.

292~~~
Think he's a good talent, just lazy.
