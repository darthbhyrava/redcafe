Mods, delete if thread has already existed. But I haven't found a thread for his performances this season here?

2~~~
seems like a good partnership with Shaw down the left hand. him or Memphis to be first choice come the start of the competitive season?

3~~~
Sell or keep for left back depth.

4~~~
don't think so going by the current look of things

5~~~
His final ball and creativity has looked better this pre season, while keeping the good overall play he had last season for the most part. Some still don't like him and he's not seen as a starting 11 player but I think he'll be starting the season as a starter simply because more often then not, he plays better then plenty of our other players on the pitch. So it doesn't matter if he's not as talented as some others, as long as he performs well, he'll be starting games I think.

Why would we sell him when he's one of our best performing players on a consistent basis? Because 2-3 years ago he was a frustrating player to watch? Come on.

6~~~
Cause we're the sort of club that aims for a standard that the likes of Young just can't contribute too. Plus we have youngsters who can give us whatever it is he's meant to be giving us.

7~~~
Why would you sell him though? Even if we should look for better for the starting 11, surely he's done more then enough to show he's a very useful player to have in the squad? You can't just have a starting 11 and then youngsters making up the squad, it's basically what Arsenal have done for the past 10 years and why they've failed to do anything for the past 10 years.

8~~~
He's quiet, consistent and provides a good final ball. No reason why people still need to think of him as a pariah. To his credit, he has pulled himself out after a rather god awful season with Moyes.

9~~~
Arsenal's first 11 has been riddled with holes throughout all the years hence they've failed. Their really talented youngsters have been an aid rather than a reason for their failures. I'd rather see Lingard get the game time rather than young.

10~~~
me too.

young hasn't been awful for the past year, but again, our expectations for him are so low that it was always going to be an improvement.

11~~~
Ok so he's alright but he's never gonna win us a match late on or help us against teams of City's quality.

12~~~
His main contribution was a nice slide pass into Shaw's overlapping run, other than that offered no creative spark at all.

13~~~
Didn't expect him to be subbed off. Not sure if he'll start vs Spurs now as Van Gaal probably wasn't too happy. Or maybe he just wanted to give Pereira a half. Who knows.

14~~~
Poor tour overall for Young. Nowhere near his standard of performance on last year's tour. Best you could say is that he linked well with Shaw in some games but even then the end product hasn't quite been there. Will be lucky if he starts the Spurs game, given the extent to which Pereira out-performed him.

Against PSG Young was both negative and sloppy in his passing.

15~~~
That's Young and that's why he should never be a starter for United. LVG seems to like him for his work rate but that should never be the main reason to play a winger.

16~~~
he was pretty quiet. didn't do anything terrible, but didn't really provide much either. pereira was certainly an upgrade.

wonder if there could be any truth to the rumours that united are willing to sell him this summer?

17~~~
As much as Young looked good last season his goal scoring and assists ratio have not been good. We really need a player who's going to contribute a lot more goals to his game.

18~~~
He's not a first teamer for us but he provides good depth and is exactly the sort of character we want around the squad. Di Maria should take note.

19~~~
Selling him is stupid. He really wasn't any worse than Willian at Chelsea last season.

20~~~
Not saying that I want us to sell him, but there is definitely logic on selling players when they are doing well. It is something that Chelsea has been doing these last few years on the likes of Mata, David Luiz and co. On the other side, United has been doing the very opposite things, keeping players until they become completely useless for us and then selling them for peanuts (like we did with Nani).

If we think that Young isn't an integral part of the team and we can upgrade that position then I guess that right now we could get some good money for him, but if we wait one another year or two, then we won't get nothing for him. Same can be said for Fellaini who als had a quite good season for us.

Nevermind, I am not saying that we should (or should not) sell him. Just that there is some good logic on selling players on the high if we think that we can do better in their position.

21~~~
I thought Willian was much more productive going forward that Young.  Young had a really good season because he did so much good work helping with defence but going forward he was awful. Very very few of his crosses ever find a player and that for a wide attacking player is basically their most important job. Find your own players with the ball.

22~~~
I think Willian was preferred specifically for his ability to help in defence. Plus young was good attacking wise in most games he played in the wings (as opposed to wingback)

23~~~
I dont think Young was any good at all going forward as a winger. He had a couple of assists and goals but apart from that the vast majority of his crosses were simply wasted.  He played well with respect to his defensive work and I do wonder if that blinded people to just how awful his delivery into the box has been.

24~~~
Willian was less productive than Ashley Young, not the other way round despite Willian playing a lot more and the fact that Young played lots of games at LB. Not sure why people pretend he was only there for his defensive work when he was our best player going forward in a lot of the games towards the end of the season. He's a better player than Willian.

25~~~
A lot of crosses were missed by the likes of rvp and falcao. He was our source of attack for a lot of games( like the crystal palace game for instance)

26~~~
Young upped the consistency of his crossing last season, he regularly delivered the ball in to good areas with little to no reward. The fact that we had so little threat or intent from the strikers and that our build up was so slow meant that he was often crossing in to a box flooded with an organised and comfortable defence. This is only ever going to have poor returns but is clearly what he was tasked to do.

Young isn't perfect, he generally struggles to deliver crosses that specifically pick out a man in a free form situation but he did prove last season that he can whip a ball in to a dangerous area that you would typically expect a forward to be attacking. The forwards job should be to learn these patterns and anticipate the situation accordingly, alas not one of them seemed to this. I think Hernandez would enjoy playing with Young as he (Young) rarely surprises with what and how he delivers and yet still somehow manages to engineer the opportunity to do so.

For all his faults (and I am by no means a big fan of him) Young was the primary attacking outlet in the final third of the pitch for large swathes of last season despite the supposed superior quality and technique of those around him. In theory he should only be a back up player but was rightly one of the first names on the teamsheet last season based on application and performance.

27~~~
Are you being sarcastic? If not,this is the dumbest comment I have ever read. Are you serious right now? It is really funny reading your comment because Ashley young  has won us a late game and was MOTM against City last season. Common now.

28~~~
Nice assist.....

29~~~
Rooney's assist?

30~~~
Claiming too many fouls. Needs to be stronger.

31~~~
He was a threat there in that first half, some things went his way like the assist, some things didn't but at least he's given the Spurs defenders something to think about anyways. Himself and Memphis appear to be developing an understanding too.

32~~~
Our attack seems to come through him and that's why we don't create anything.

33~~~
All been said before but it really is impressive how he's turned things around. You don't have to worry about what he'll give you anymore and there was a time when he wouldn't dare take his man on.

34~~~
Bollocks. He was fine. Good work as usual.

35~~~
Very Ashley Young performance, looked threatening, gave us width. Stuffed up the final ball.

36~~~
He's so wasteful, terrible final ball.

37~~~
I thought he gave pretty much nothing today, though. His delivery was dire. There was a solid 5 minute patch where Bastian kept passing him the ball in lots of space and he either ran into Walker, kicked the ball at Walker or over/under hit his cross.

He's not good enough to be a Man Utd winger.

38~~~
Pretty much. I actually don't understand why we extended his contract. Get Pedro in asap.

39~~~
Walker bullied him. Ran around a lot though.

40~~~
Precisely.

41~~~
Did fine, but not the level you want to see from United's main winger. 

6/10...where's the new signing?

42~~~
Fully agree with that. Yes he passed the ball that lead to the goal but outside of that he was awful with the ball.

43~~~
Reminded me of Valencia on the wing today. Useless and blind passes.

44~~~
The thing about Young that I love is his drive and energy; it's a comforting link to the Fergie era. But he just doesn't have a consistent enough end product to justify holding down the position. I'm definitely glad to have him on the team, though.

45~~~
Nothing Special but not bad as well. Still hope for an upgrade on the wings.

46~~~
Terrible to be honest. Didn't get past Walker once, and his crossing was hit and hope. If we do get Pedro I hope it's Young that makes way.

47~~~
We really need to improve on him. He wasn't terrible or anything, but given Mata's lack of pace, he often becomes the guy we go to for creativity and delivery, and who we make space to pass the ball out to. And what he does with that space just isn't enough. It's decent, but this isn't the quality a top side needs. 

Also, his default routine is sort of offset by the guys in the box being Rooney and Mata.

48~~~
That's not really how I saw it. Maybe we have different expectations from him but if he's running at a full back, making him make a tackle, winning the odd corner and putting something in the box then I'm not annoyed. Don't think he got much help from Shaw today either. His part in the goal was very easy to feck up in my opinion.

I don't want him starting week in week out, but I think there's a place for him here.

49~~~
He seems unable to produce a decent quality cross with his left foot when running. Other than that he is okay.

50~~~
You are easily pleased mate.

51~~~
So they tell me.

52~~~
Well you have expectations from him, I have expectations from a Utd winger. Maybe that's harsh but when I see Young I do not see someone close to that level. I'm also pretty sure we're going to see him week in week out, barring massive signings, because LvG seems to love him to the extent that he's playing Memphis centrally instead.

53~~~
It's like he's instantly dropped back to his old levels following the extension.

54~~~
He gives 100% and that's something you can't fault, his quality on the ball however and the threat he offers on the attack, well that is. We need to improve the wings massively otherwise we better get used to these toothless attacking performances with an embarrassing one effort on goal.

55~~~
he's got great stamina, good first move but his final ball was off today, still was quite creative and one of our best players, which is worrying..

56~~~
Did well overall, but his glaring lack of end product will always be a problem for us. It just never looks threatening when he's on the ball.

57~~~
He's pretty much replaced Welbeck as the grafter with little end product. Did well for the goal but he really should have done better with his shot as well.

He still had our only shot on goal though.

58~~~
Hopefully he'll be on bench next week and Memphis will play out wide.

59~~~
good comment, exactly how I feel about him. He's solid option and squad player. People came here to slate him for no reason it's funny. The so called Ronaldo Memphis did feck all the whole game and was certainly worse than Young who although was quite average still belonged to one of our most creative players. The final product was not there though but at least he tried. We will see how memphis plays there or anyone else who comes new in the team.

60~~~
Apart from the goal.

61~~~
If youre playing professional football, you should be giving 100%. Thats below the minimum requirement, it's so obvious it should be assumed and not said. I can promise you id give 100% to play for United as well, but absolutely nobody and nothing would benefit from it outside of me.

62~~~
Yes. Did you watch the countless times he tried to dribble past Walker and lost it? Or his crossing going nowhere. 

We need to sign Pedro up soon. As hard working but a better end product.

63~~~
Most of his best games last season were of a defensive nature in the 3-5-2, his workrate is very good, but creatively he's barely average and Walker out-muscled him all game with him lacking the guile to outwit him when push and run failed.

64~~~
I agree.....but he did play a large part in the goal. I presume Pedro will be a United player next week and Young will  revert to being a decent squad player.

65~~~
Young, unfortunately, is a very predictable player and he almost never manages to find someone in the box.

66~~~
The haters will hate but Ashley is one of the guys I trust these days.

67~~~
Young showed today why he should not be more than a squad option if we are serious about competing for trophies. He had numerous one-on-one with Walker and each time he lost the ball. Final delivery was pretty poor as well. Hope we have signed up Pedro in time for the next match.

68~~~
I think Memphis playing centrally is more to do with LVG not trusting Mata there and strangely not even Herera. Young would presumably get dropped once we have Pedro signed up, but then I thought the same when we bought Di Maria.

69~~~
It should be  a straight shootout between the Depay and young for the left wing spot..One of the them should be on the bench.

70~~~
Made Kyle Walker look like Gary Neville today. Walker gobbled up his every twist and turn.

Standard Young today. Positive, energetic and seemingly dangerous, but at the end of all things the reality is that he didn't really do a great deal at all.

He gets so much of the ball and he should be doing a lot, lot better.

71~~~
Also brought back the theatrics we have grown to know him most for.

72~~~
Wrong. He was awesome against City on the left wing. Easily his best performance.

73~~~
I said most of his best games, not all of them, and there was a reason the whole Ashely Lahm thing started, and that was because of his work at wingback defensively.

74~~~
I don't think he should be starting for us, and I reckon Pedro will displace him.

He gets so much space, the only of our players today to find himself in good space, and he consistently wastes it.

Fair play to him for finding the space but we need better. Pedro will find that space and use it.

75~~~
Every single match the same thing happens

United will get a dangerous attack going.. The ball will get spread wide to someone in miles of space.. I'm on the edge of my seat.. This looks dangerous.. I realize it's Ashley Young.. I sit back knowing he will mess it up.. He does.

People say he had a great season last season but I disagree. He wasted far too many chances and looks to be the same again.

76~~~
Should be used as a squad player. First choice means we have a very limited attacking threat from his side of the pitch.

77~~~
1 average game and he should be gone already? He just signed a new 3 year contract

78~~~
To be fair to him, he played some good stuff last season. But yeah he's top the quality of winger we need as first choice.

79~~~
Thought Young was one of our best players today. At least he makes things happen - was involved in our three best chances.

Complain about something else today.

80~~~
0/6 successful crosses.

No idea why he lumps it so high when we have Rooney and Mata in the box.

81~~~
Dont understand all the stick he gets here. Walker is no pushover and i think Young did pretty well today. Got himself into good positions and delivered an assist and a very decent effort

I expect Memphis to make the LW position his, but um glad we have Young as a backup

82~~~
1 average game? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

And I wouldn't have given him a new deal, especially not anything over a year.

83~~~
Doesn't the ball to Rooney count as a cross?

84~~~
He's probably still checking the stats.........

85~~~
He did have a hugely improved season last year and was okay today, more of the same, but his end product is shocking. The amount of time he gets the ball in good positions yet never picks someone out with a cross is a bit ridiculous. Definitely something we need to improve on (pedro hopefully, or Memphis on the left) if we want to score more goals.

86~~~
Thought he did pretty well, gave 100% and set up the goal I believe, can't expect the world from him, afterall he's no Neymar. <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>
I'm glad, if he gives us another year like last I'd be more than happy.

87~~~
I thought he was one of our better players today, put in a good shift and created a couple of chances going forward. I really dont think we can expect a hell of a lot more from him.

88~~~
Worked hard, our most dangerous player going forward and helped the defenders massively.

89~~~
I think that's part of our problem. We attack (in terms of getting to the byline, getting in behind or cutting in across) an awful lot down youngs side. An awful lot and there is not enough productivity. We saw him today assisting and he probably should have scored but he doesn't have 'IT'. That position you have to have quality week in week out and we don't get that week in week out. So yes he played well, but that don't matter. In that position, you have to play GREAT...He's the Hazard of the team or the Silva. Not enough quality.

Not his fault but it's an important role when you have Mata on the other wing. We need better penetration and someone like Pedro would have probably caused them real problems because he's very quick

90~~~
He's weak, mentally and physically, I would have him train in a boxing ring, with 4 oz gloves and have him literally fight for his place. It might toughen him up.

91~~~
Honestly reading back through this thread makes my mind boggle...he created more than anyone else in our team. Set up the goal, good cutback for Memphis, won a couple of fouls in dangerous areas. Given the nature of the game (i.e. tight as a gnats chuff), i dont see anyone else on the pitch who created a great deal more. Im not saying young is the bees knees or anything but I dont get the criticism today.

p.s. worked his arse off as well

92~~~
He gets afforded a lot of space out on the wing so it's a shame he can't make better use of it with his crossing on a consistent basis. Most of the time his end product is severely lacking. He doesn't shy away though and does a good job of getting involved as well as doing a solid job tracking defensively. If we want to go places though he needs to be a rotation player rather than a starter. Over the course of a season I expect the stats will show once again that he hasn't been productive enough. Decent job today though, his average kind of game I thought.

93~~~
Big Mata fan, but Young was much better than him today. The big problem is the front three, they created very little and there doesn't seem to be any communication between them at all.

94~~~
Crap offensively. About 10 of our attacks broke down because of his end product, the goal he set up he literally couldn't not make the pass. I really hope we sign Pedro.

95~~~
Finds himself in some fantastic positions but his final ball is so frustrating at times. Maybe I expect too much but he needs to better for me.

96~~~
The only reason he gets game time is because he understands the system in terms of premier league games. He does the exact same thing every game and it just works with the dynamics of the rest of the team. I would much prefer if Herrera replaced him in the starting 11 with depay taking his spot but I feel that would mess up the balance of our team.

97~~~
No, he wasn't. Young got owned by Walker throughout the match.

98~~~
Squad player, works hard but flatters to deceive, and doesn't put up the numbers.

Wouldn't start for any of our rivals, and we need to upgrade him ASAP.

99~~~
I think he's done very, very well to deceive the club into handing him a new contract. Played out of his arse last year, although he didn't create much, and is now settled for a few more years. Quicker we replace him, the better.

100~~~
Thought Walker played him very well today, which was more down to him and not Young underperforming. He marked him very tightly and prevented him from crossing on most attempts.

101~~~
Our best attacker by some distance today. Wasn't he responsible for pretty much every shot at goal(on target) along with the assist for the goal? Can't understand how he is getting any stick considering the performances of Rooney, Memphis and Mata all of whom are more highly rated and just as if not more disappointing. He didn't play well by any means but those bashing him for his performance today are speaking bollocks. People say there is a biased hate towards Rooney but if young was putting in the performances he has recently then I don't even want to think about the hate he would get on here. Unbelievable.

102~~~
Played out of his arse last year and managed a grand total of 2 goals and 5 assists. Thats not good enough, unless your happy to just stay where we are and fight for 4th every season?

He's a squad player. No more, no less. And yes, he needs replacing in the first team if we're to get back to the top. Nothing wrong with having him in the squad, or giving him a new contract though.

103~~~
Oh, I agree. I didn't rate his performances much, last season. However, the general consensus was that he played well, which isn't too far off the mark. He was half decent last season, as a LWB, not great on the wing bar the Spurs and City games. 

As you say, squad player at the most. Although, I would much rather see more quality on the bench; got a sh*t feeling, at half time, when I saw who we had on the bench, in terms of attacking players.

104~~~
Played pretty well. Him and Walker had a good battle - one which wWalker admittedly got the better of. A couple of times he nearly got round him with a nice trick and Walker recovered and stopped him. Sometimes you've gotta give credit to the opposition without faulting you're own player much

105~~~
Not when the player has performed similarly in most of his United career.

106~~~
He's just so uninspiring. We pass to him on the left, he takes one man on then crosses in to the box. Randomly. Every time. He never plays it toward anyone, he never sees a runner and plays to him. He stares at the grass and hopes for the best.

107~~~
I'm not saying he should be first choice, just that he put in a pretty good performance and came up against an even better performance by his opposing full back. Walker really needed to be on his game otherwise he'd have been roasted. Obviously I like most would much rather see Memphis on that wing.

108~~~
Im one of Youngs biggest critics. I absolutely hate how he slows up every attack on the left he is involved in because he is trying to get the ball on to his right foot.  Defenders know he cant cross with his left and they approach him with their body shape set up to keep him on his left. Everything just slows up because of this and we never get quick ball delivered in from the left. When he does deliver a cross 90% of the time its rubbish and never finds a team mate.
However he has good qualities, his positioning is good, he works really hard at providing cover for his fullback and does some really good defensive work.  He may not be super quick but he is good with the ball at his feet.

So why the feck dont we ever play him on the right???

Maybe if he was allowed to play where he can make more effective use of his natural kicking foot then we would see better crosses coming in for our attacking players. I am sure his positioning and defensive work on the right would be just as good as it is on the left. The own goal Spurs scored on sat came from a perfectly weighted ball to Rooney from Young out wide on the right.

I still dont get why he never gets used on the right, surely he would be more effective there?

109~~~
Whenever he's played there for us he's been even worse. 

Young is good against a full back he's quicker than. Walker he isn't, and walker just bullied him. 

He's just so bang average. Wants to cut inside and whip it in on his right, but his crosses in general are aimless.

When we signed him we were one of the best sides in Europe. How on earth did he ever end up
Here?

110~~~
Everyone's talking about Young's numbers but didn't he put a goal on the plate for Rooney? Young's not the top quality attacker we need but he does contribute much to our attacks than Mata for example, yet no one is queuing up to talk about Mata's lack of assists.

111~~~
Theres been plenty of talk about Mata's lack of creativity.

112~~~
Average player that has become massively overrated by a small contingent on here. He's become one of those players that if you dare to criticise, the holier than thou brigade come out. Yes, he was one of our best players last season but that was in a thoroughly underwhelming season. He's a good squad player and I have no problem with him being one. He shouldn't be a starter though, and I don't agree with the three year contract.

I thought he was pretty poor today. As an attacking outlet he offered next to nothing. People fail to understand that this guy has been given an attacking role and yet, his numbers are so poor considering what he's out there to do. He's a hard worker and always gives his all but he's such an average player.

113~~~
Has lost the ability to beat a man

114~~~
You see them boys waiting to gave a go at him come out of their shells. What has happened in this thread? Reminds me of the previous Smalling thread. One poor match and loads come to bash them. He's been our best attacking player since Arsenal in the FA Cup.

115~~~
We do so well to get him one and one Vs his RB and he just doesn't do enough. He is playing at his level, its just not good enough for us.

When Depay put him in, id expect a Pedro to slot that away. Young took a touch wide to try and cross for some reason.

116~~~
He wasn't great, didn't get much support from his fullback. Found myself saying "why are you in the corner on the ball with your man and there is nobody within 30 yards of you?.." Bummer he won't get an assist for the goal. Was a nice ball, I'd much prefer him on the right getting the ball wide, turning and driving in. Not playing an inverted winger role when he clearly has the only telegraphed option of feinting at the byline and turning back for a low percentage right footed inswinging cross. He needs to get into position to use that patented Ashley "L1+O" Young curler.

117~~~
Don't be so precious. Have a look at pretty much all our player threads after today and it's a similar trend. Most of the 'critsism' in here is constructive. People have been saying we need an upgrade for a long time now; don't fool yourself and think it's only after today. Is there really any harsh unwarranted criticism in here? I confess I haven't read every post.

118~~~
Young is certainly no world beater, but he isnt below average either. I agree we should do better, but I myself remember the games where all of our players could do feck all and Young was the only one beating his men, creating chances, putting in some shift, linking with the FB on a consistent basis. He is a good player, maybe a squad player idealistically but he isnt awful, and the criticism above is undeserved. Nor has he been bad for us consecutively to portray this criticism as grounded.

119~~~
Walker is extremely quick and strong. Hard to beat, it's not surprising,  and we didn't work any overload situations to compensate. 

I'm confused about the train of comments after the match. It's obvious that we need someone to upgrade on Young. But the only times we vaguely looked like scoring all came through Young. And the only decent ball in the final third was by Young and resulted in the og.

120~~~
I have been having a go at him for years but do think he deserves a decent run of games on the right.

121~~~
As I said, I haven't read all the post in here. The ones I've skinned over seem to be fine. I wouldn't say that people calling for a better standard of player would constitute as criticism. These are all concerns that have been raised even during Young' impressive run last season. He is clearly a good viable squad option but I, as many others do, feel we should be aiming for a higher standard of player. That's reality as opposed to criticism. 

He wasn't woeful today, I mean maybe a 6/10 at best which is fine, but 'fine' isn't good enough. Look at the Mata thread and he is also being called out. Young isn't the whipping boy he used to be on here, the critisim these days is far more balanced and not OTT hysteria.

122~~~
Could have conceivably ended the match with 2 assists and a goal today.

I don't think anyone is claiming that he is someone we should build the side around, simply that he is performing at a level higher than most of those around him. Profligate, yes but he seems to be the only one currently capable of creating a chance even if it does take him 10 attempts. If he didn't make those crosses then in all likelihood the ball would have just been snailed around until we lost possession, as happened consistently throughout the match.

Walker did well against him today but Young kept trying to take him on and make something happen. I'm not sure anyone else on the team tried to beat a man. The fact that he appears to be our de-facto creative outlet is a grim indictment of those around him but until others step up he thoroughly deserves a spot in the team.

Young isn't the future, just currently the lesser evil in an awfully blunt attacking unit.

How in the world we came to a situation where we have just shipped Nani out for small change and ended up playing Young and Mata as wingers is beyond my level of comprehension.

123~~~
Thought Kyle Walker played well. I'd have liked to have seen Memphis switch with Young and have a run at him when it was apparant Young couldn't beat him. We seem to be quite good at getting our wide players in plenty of space, but we're not making enough of that.

124~~~
Quite, anyone who is happy with that performance is too easily satisfied.

125~~~
It is a shame his pass to Rooney won't get the recognition it deserves. It was a quality ball, nutmeg to boot.
Namely here.

126~~~
Yeah thought the same, Walker really got upto him and he tried to put the ball around him but couldn't beat him for pace either. Still felt like our most successful creative outlet would come from that wing. Luke Shaw did him no favors by not overlapping to give Walker something to think about.

127~~~
Not sure if LVG didn't want the fullbacks to get forward as Darmian didn't either.

128~~~
Darmian got in some good spaces, his issue was Mata's lack of pace and ability to cover for him defensively to run ahead and overlap. Van Gaal loves his full backs to overlap, both Shaw and Darmian did that a lot on tour.

129~~~
I like his threat on the left but his delivery is really poor.

130~~~
The issue is more that Mata gets the ball with his back to space and instantly looks to pass it back to somebody. If on the off chance he turns inside he is more there to open up play inside in the centre and it's usually a secondary ball going inside out down the right flank from someone playing inside.

This makes timings of the run or the intent to get forward virtually impossible, especially if you are making sure not to be caught out of position badly enough to get the hair dryer for Van Gaal. It's nobodies fault really, it is just how the team is setup. Mata rarely has the advantage of his man for long enough to allow Darmian to make a run 100% without leaving any of the right flank open.

131~~~
Typical Young performance today, grafted hard, linked up well with Shaw. Not a world beater, but not everyone is going to be, even in a big team.

132~~~
Without Fellaini, he will be even less useful. His forte is the floating ball far post. Be it heskey, carew or Fellaini, he needs a tall player there to be productive.

133~~~
Sad state of affairs when that performance is considered "good" from a United winger these days. 

You are useless as a wide player if you do not have an end product. Young doesn't have an end product.

134~~~
Yes, except for delivering the ball which lead to our only goal.

135~~~
It's like literally people forgot where our <b>only</b> goal came from. Young wasn't tearing shit up, no, but still was one of our better players yesterday and would've had an assist (can you have it from an og?) if Rooney hadn't bottled it.

136~~~
Heh. Criticised for end product in game where he was only United player that actually produced any. Ashley brings out the inner retard in some caftards, it seems.

He also set Memphis up for a shot which was blocked by a defender very close to the line and forced Vorn into the only (I think?) save he made in the game.

So yeah, Young was pretty much single-handely responsible for <i>all</i> our end product on the day. Perfect time to criticise him for lacking it, right?

137~~~
He needs to stop thinking he can beat a defender with his tricks. The sooner, he does that, the better for all of us.

138~~~
Why would you want him to stop that? He's the only one that looks to take his man on.

139~~~
He constantly keeps beating his man or finding himself in acres of space and then goes on to fluff his delivery. He doesn't nearly have a good end product to start regularly for Manchester United. Never knew that was up for debate.

So, yes, he doesn't have an end product of any quality. Even the worst players can find their man once in a while, it doesn't mean that they have a 'good end product'.

140~~~
Just because you don't think that way, doesn't it mean it's not up for debate. He proved last season that when he was benching our most expensive signing in history(on merit) that he's a worthy starter here. People here tend to look for reputations rather than actual performances, hence the reason why the likes of Fellaini and Young keep on being constantly under-rated whereas there's a constant clamouring to start Mata even though he's been no better than both of them ever since he has joined.

141~~~
How many times did he he beat caulker 1 on 1 yesterday?

142~~~
I am not looking at reputations, I am looking at his performances. And I have never 'clamored' for Mata to start, so I don't know why you are accusing me of that. He kept the most expensive signing out as that signing was not up to the standards, not that he kept another performing player on the bench.

I have said it many times that he does a lot of things well. Right now he looks like the only player capable of beating his marker and getting in good positions, though his delivery is so atrocious that he constantly lets himself down. Do you think I am incorrect in my observation?

For some one who, at times, beats his marker with ease, his end product is nothing to write home about. Is that not a legitimate criticism?

143~~~
Eugenuis under LVG we play our way methodically to the final 3rd. Get our wingers (Young) 1 on 1 and he can't beat a man. Now Young puts in a shift but we need better quality. Mata on the other side is the same we need better in that position but on the right a player more suited to the role than Mata. But in Youngs case on the left he is that type of player but just not good enough if we want to win things. Plus our wingers (wide forwards) need to be making diagonal runs but they don't and it causes us to be predictable and turgid up top.

144~~~
Same old Young. Finding himself in space and wasting half of his crosses yet still our only player who created half decent chances which ultimately led to the goal. This has happened quite a few times(see Palace and Arsenal last season).

This probably underlines that its rest of the team that has problems creating chances instead of Young.

145~~~
Walker's pace makes him a tough man to beat but he still created space with his dribbling and put balls in. Unfortunately, his delivery isn't good enough unless the team has a tall guy at the far post. 

All our attackers play a conservative, pass it, game. I'm glad someome tries to create something even if he isn't very good at it.

146~~~
Fairly sure his most recent assist (assuming yesterday doesn't count) was converted by Hererra, at knee height.

147~~~
Based on yesterdays performances and chances created, everyone else in the team needs dropping before Young.

148~~~
We need to improve on our wide options, clearly.

But given our current options Young has to play, unless Depay can do better.

149~~~
I'd like to point out that people who post 0/6 succesful crosses ignore the fact that the simple fact is even for the leagues best, 75% of crosses won't find the man.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2303835/Premier-League-crossers--best-worst-season.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/fo...emier-League-crossers--best-worst-season.html</a>

This is a link from a few years ago now, but illustrates the point well. West Ham had the best cross completion out of the whole league. At less than 25%. Gareth Bale who would go on to be player of the year had 12.5 success rate. 

Crosses are hard. Soemtimes Ashley Young puts a good ball in and no-one is there. Sometimes there is literally not a cross on and he'll win us a corner.

150~~~
Young was average yesterday but in fairness to him there is never a lot of movement. Rooney nowadays is static and there is no obvious target. The one time a player, Depay, did pull cleverly into space Young found him with a great pass.

I'd like to have seen more of Schniederlin looking for the ball in the box. Seems a hell of a waste to me when you've got two big six footers in Carrick and Schniederlin yet the only outlet on the back stick is Mata. 

Let's give Spurs Hernandez, Lingard, Januzaij for the season and the £45m Di Maria money and solve all our problems with Harry Kane.

151~~~
Does that mean most of his crosses aren't high balls to the far post?

152~~~
Right but Young has about 10 assists over the past 3 years. Compare those stats to the best wingers in the league over the same time. 

Valencia used to win us corner after corner by smashing his crosses into the defenders legs but that wasn't a good thing. Young always has to come back on to his right foot which makes him predictable and slows our attacks down, we also don't have anyone in the box without Felliani who can take advantage of the crosses he delivers. Even his cross to Rooney yesterday, Rooney had literally the entire box to himself and should have been able to finish that chance first time but the cross was too close to his body and he had to take the touch.

People make so many excuses for Young because he's English and tries hard. If he was a £30-40 million foriegn signing he'd be getting ripped to shreds like Mata does. Young gets £120k a week and has been one of our highest paid players for the past 4 years, is it too much to expect him to match the output of the other top wingers around?

153~~~
He's just our best winger at the moment.

154~~~
We better sign a couple of wingers then, because that is poor.

155~~~
Both are correct.

156~~~
His end product is very poor.

157~~~
I cant understand why we're still playing him when we've got Memphis in the team. Jeez it reminds me of when SAF used to stick Fletcher on the flanks despite we having Ronaldo.

158~~~
This, I like him as a player but he doesn't produce enough. He looks like he can get goals, and a bag of assists, but then he never does.

159~~~
I agree. He is basically our main man to create goals from the wings problem is he produces no where near enough.

160~~~
No but it torpedoes your "delivery isn't good enough" point.

161~~~
I.think zabelata and bellerin would beg to differ.

162~~~
He's also our only winger. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

163~~~
The bold part reminded me: When we signed Memphis I thought/hoped it meant Young would switch flanks.

Young's time spent with the ball is a lot like of what Nani got hounded for time and again.  Except Nani's problem was likely heavily linked to pecking order in that after he beat his man (and before, for that matter) he kept waiting for some mythical perfect pass to open up.  

I agree Young should be tried on the right, with instructions to whip in early crosses to keep defenders guessing (otherwise defenders will do to him what they did to Nani pre-mini-renaissance, which was stand off him until he dallied on the ball long enough for his targets to all be marked).  But that'll never happen under the keep-possession-or-lose-your-place regime.

Memphis on the left with license to shoot, Young on the right to provide supply without having to bring the ball back onto his preferred foot seems a fine set up with which to create chances.  Especially with the bolstered midfield behind them to regain possession and capitalize on rebounds/clearances.  Heck, throw Mata or Herrera behind the striker, and with Mata's excellent control and finishing and Herrera's excellent tackling, on any given day it would seem like an ideal set up to win free kicks in dangerous areas and in general keep the opposition on their back foot.

We'll probably never know.

164~~~
Bizzare logic but not surprised to see you use it for someone like Young.

165~~~
Contrarion is dead hip these days. Gets one attention.

166~~~
So that's two in a season of 50 odd games great......

167~~~
Ofcourse but that isn't why Pogue's defending Young's delivery with such poor reasoning.

168~~~
He can contribute lot more if he can link up with players close to him and look for ways to penetrate the box. That is our best option, compared to him crossing from the wings.

169~~~
I was just naming multiple examples. My point was that you don't make  assumptions based on the first game. Ashley young has the ability to beat any full back he wants to any day of the week, it is the consistency of his end product that has let him down.

170~~~
Obiorahking you think this opinion is over one game? I don't mind Young but let's not pretend he goes by people at ease! He doesn't he would be better as the 10 than as a left winger!

171~~~
Typical Young performance for me. I just don't think he's good enough to play as our left winger and it's baffling that Depay has to play in the centre when he would be perfect for that position based on last season

172~~~

173~~~
I'd love to hear what he thinks Young did well because I didnt see that

174~~~
Set up our only goal?

175~~~
Well any of us could have made that pass when Rooney had the entire box to himself but regardless Young's cross was from the right wing, people are questioning why he's being played on the left and what he did well there. Young could be on the right, Mata the middle and Memphis on the left.

176~~~
Oh give over, as if any of us could have done that. He made a great run to receive his pass in the first place then played a ball through the defender's legs right to Rooney's feet.

177~~~
He made the run and an easy pass, ok. What else?

178~~~
What else is an attacking player expected to do apart from score and set up goals? Oh yeah he put in a good shift defensively too. It wasn't a vintage performance from any of our attackers but he was the one in our attack who got us the 3 points. Your efforts to downplay this are blatant.

So checklist:

Set up our only goal of the game - CHECK
Had our only shot on target of the game - CHECK
Helped out well defensively - CHECK

179~~~
It's amusing to see him getting so much stick when he's easily been one of our best and most dangerous attacking player for a good while. You almost get the feeling people want him to fail. We'd be playing Europa league football if it weren't for him

180~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9foi342LXQE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

181~~~
Tottenham were on the back foot after giving up possession in a dangerous position. He had lots of room to work with after Memphis played him in. It's a standard pick out most wingers could play. The stuff used to defend Young is bizarre, especially after everyone used to rip into every move he made before LVG's arrival, and nit pick other players we sign beyond new levels. If a winger can't pick out a pass like that then god fecking help us. The system is crippling our attacking play and having Young as the focal point of the attack is making it even worse. The guy plays 1 good game then 6 average/bad ones but tries hard. His delivery is on the whole pretty awful, hence why he struggles so often to pick out a man in the box unless big Marouane is pushing people around.

182~~~
Young was arguably our best player in the closing few games of last season and definitely our best attacking player against Spurs. If Van Gaal is picking on form then Young should contnually be picked on the left wing. Which is what he seems to be doing.

183~~~
Bizarre stuff like contributing to goals? Give over indeed!

He begins to address the stick that's been used to beat him all summer (assist stat) in the first game of the season and apparently this assist doesn't count!

184~~~
I don't think he does get an assist for Saturday actually....

Maybe if his cross had been better and Rooney didn't need to take the touch <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

185~~~
You seem to have a very simple and limited view of things. You have to watch a player for 90 mins and that goal was more down to us winning the ball in midfield or would you say Rooney had a brilliant game as he "almost scored" the goal?

186~~~
I sense a bit of a turn back against Young which I think is a but unfair.

for me, he's the one reliable part of our front 4!

Depay did a lot of falling over and running nowhere.
Mata comes inside every single time and can't keep us shape out wide.
Rooney, looked like he'd been on a 2 week bender in Spain

Young gets it, keeps it, more often than not turns his man inside out, ok not always in the glamour way of beating full backs for pace we all romantically love, but most often he gets a ball in. When Fellaini is in there it's a fabulous combo. When we have a fairly small winger, Rooney, and Depay, who the heck is going to head it anyway

I'd say he's most deserving of keeping his place out of that front 4.

187~~~
I might get lambasted for this, but his performance was very similar to many of di Marias, last season. Picked up an assist, got into good positions but incredibly wasteful and couldnt beat his man.

188~~~
His dribbling style is weird as feck, no wonder it rarely succedes. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

He did well the other day, set up a goal and done his job defensively.

189~~~
Of course I wouldn't say Rooney had a brilliant game seeing he messed up his big chance. I didn't even say Young had a brilliant game, I just find the criticism on here after he won us 3 points to be insane.

You can't say "that goal was more down to winning the ball in midfield". It was to do with that, it was also largely to do with Memphis and Young doing everything right once the opportunity arose. It might not have been fancy but you can't fault that bit of play from either of them, they did everything you want in a great counter attack, something we haven't seen enough of in the last few seasons. Well I say you can't, but somehow you managed it...

190~~~
Have you seen the pass? It was almost perfect! The only way it could have been better was if it was slightly in front of Rooney by maybe a yard. You blaming Rooney's poor touch and lack of awareness on Young is really quite amazing.

191~~~
The cross for the goal was good, but it was a square pass across 15/20 yards. Let's not exaggerate.

He was rubbish. Hopefully Van Gaal drops him soon and gets Memphis out wide because he isn't a striker, and he's a better player than Young.

192~~~
The ones exaggerating are the ones saying it was a bad pass. It wasn't a challenging pass but I've seen those messed up plenty especially as he was under pressure.

193~~~
Nothing was wrong with that pass he played no, but if he can't do that 9/10 he shouldn't be playing for United. In his position despite not even knowing you, I'd fancy you could hit a 15 yard square ball.

194~~~
Not through the defenders legs I couldn't. I wouldn't have the ball in that position anyway because I wouldn't have made the run he did or timed it like he did.

195~~~
He's done well enough to earn his contract last season, but he wasn't outstanding like some suggest. He was an outlet, worked hard and teamed up well with the left back and Fellaini. A decent season. Nothing more, nothing less.

He's never a first team player however. I hope his extended run in the side come to an end, sooner rather than later, as he just isn't of the level required to be a mainstay in the team every single week. Hopefully the - likely impending - arrival of Pedro, will see LVG revert back to a 4-3-3 with the Spaniard and Memphis flanking Rooney. They are natural, wide forwards and comfortably better than Young. LVG bleats on about balance and he'll have no excuses not to deploy the team in that set-up if Pedro joins.

196~~~
I dont think there is single person who suggested that he was outstanding, people just give credit where it's due. It was a good season for him and no superlatives spotted in season reviews of him. However he was one of our best players. Does that say something ? Yes, we should aim higher not settle for Young standard but I am really sick of people who just like to discredit him for no reason even when he belongs to the best performers like it was against Tottenham which was solid performance, better than Mata and Memphis and Rooney for sure. Was that that great? No, but shut up with the criticism. If it was Depay people would be like yeah great promising performance keep it up.

Young is solid squad player we should try memphis there but unless Van Gaal bring in someone or try the Dutchman or Januzaj/Pereira there we can do shit all about it and stay positive for what's positive not negative even before he kicks the ball.

197~~~
Even if Rooney scored you wouldnt say he had a good game, and thats the point. Young made the final pass, fine, but besides that, he didnt offer much and had a poor game. So you can tick all the boxes but at the end of the day he didnt get past Walker and didnt offer enough going forward which is his main task

198~~~
His main task is setting up goals which he accomplished.

199~~~
It wasn't a top performance but it's clear from the reactions that a lot of people can't wait to see him out of the team. It doesn't matter how well he plays because his name is Ashley Young, ergo he shouldn't play. You can't argue with people like that, it's a waste of time. 

He was no worse than our other attacking players, in fact he was arguably better.

200~~~
So by making one assist (which was not a difficult one) you think his job is done and all is well? As I said, you have a very simplistic view

201~~~
Technically it wasn't an assist.

202~~~
I suppose Rooney actually gets an assist for it? I believe Willian was given an assist for the own goal in the Chelsea match.

203~~~
To be fair to him it was the first game of the season and his contribution no matter how big or small it was arguably a lot more than what the rest of our attacking players fired out. Some things didn't work out for him on Saturday, some did mainly the assist but to me he always looked like a threat to the Spurs defence.

204~~~
I don't think he gets one either. It goes down as an own goal and nothing more. (Though I think someone jumped for joy at getting fantasy points for Rooney?)

205~~~
Such low standards. Here's a list of players who were more prolific dribblers than Ashley Young last season (in the PL alone):

Hazard
Oxlade-Chamberlain
Victor Moses
Sanchez
Coutinho
Sterling
Zaha
Aguero
Mahrez
Bolasie
Montero
Sissoko
Cabella
Ozil
Cazorla
Delph
Barkley
Ameobi
Fer
Schlupp
Mane
Touré
Willian
Phillips
Di Maria
Ayoze Perez
Lamela
Wings
Puncheon
Silva
Welbeck
Bellerin
Matic
Kane
Johnson

Obviously dribbling is only one facet of a winger's game, but given it's put forward as one of Young's main strengths that says it all to me about how low our standards are. There's a direct correlation between Young being one of our most involved players in the build-up and our creativity being at its lowest point for as long as I can remember. Correlation does not equal causation and all that, but it's hardly a huge leap to suggest he's one of the causes.

206~~~
Seems he did get one:

"Wayne Rooney was awarded the official Premier League assist having had the final touch of the ball before Kyle Walker inadvertently bundled into his own net"

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.teamtalk.com/features/16129/9944443/Real-Assists-League-Roo-Willian-lose-out" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.teamtalk.com/features/16129/9944443/Real-Assists-League-Roo-Willian-lose-out</a>

Really silly.

And no, I didn't have Rooney but I did have Willian so that's something. Deserved it more anyway ;-)

207~~~
I stand corrected.

Source?

208~~~
Yes it is. It's an enormous leap. It also makes no logical sense. 

If Young is as poor as you imply then how come he's not being outshone by all the other creative players in our team? It's not as though his involvement somehow forces them to see less of the ball. He's not even playing in a central position. The whole of the centre of the pitch and the opposite flank is free for other players to step up and show Young how it's done.

The fact he's been one of our more consistently effective creative players during a period lacking in creativity says much more about the inadequacy of our other attacking players than it does about Ashley Young.

Instead of slagging him off we should be appreciative of his improved performances last season. Without them we wouldn't be playing any CL qualifier next week.

209~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/BIply6p.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/BIply6p.jpg"/>
Does it not count for anything that at least, on Saturday, he was the only player actually trying to take anyone on? Walker in my eyes actually played quite well against him. As did Davies on Mata.

210~~~
WhoScored

It counts for something, but not much. 2/11 is a pretty bad return.

211~~~
Nobody faults Young for lack of effort, it's lack of end product that's the issue. The fact that he got 2/11 take-ons and none against Walker is pretty indicative of that.

212~~~
He got the end product in this game though! It won us the game!

213~~~
How many take-ons did the other United players attempt? I don't know the answer but assume it's a low number and is the main point behind mentioning those 11 attempts by Young.

214~~~
I see people saying this but that was a pretty easy pass to make. No decent footballer should feck that up.

215~~~
He also put one on a plate for Memphis (blocked shot) 

Young might not have created <i>much</i> against Spurs but he created more than anyone else.

216~~~
I'm saying it because it's bloody true regardless of how easy the pass was to make! Rooney's shot looked easy to me too but he messed that up and I'd still consider him to be a decent footballer!

Besides, it's not just the pass but the whole play. Simple but effective.

217~~~
Young was 0/6 out of 11. 11 was the total of the entire team. Tottenham was 6/14 as a team.

A fundamental flaw in the entire front line is that they don't take people on enough, they are scared shitless to mess it up at a level where they are dropped for it. If you don't try and take people on and make things happen then you can't be seen losing the ball and be dropped.

I mean this entire inverted winger garbage is spawned from two players that like to get the ball and go inside. Young gets the ball and goes down the outside and turns back inside and plays a telegraphed cross inswinging across the face of goal. Mata gets the ball with his back to acres of space and then dribbles back 25 yards and passes it back to the defensive players.

I'm all for lumping them in a group and saying it's not working and that Young's <i>end product </i>is pretty awful but shy of getting the ball and running from the touchline to the edge of the area as many times a game as they can and shooting, I have no idea what the <i>forwards</i> (not wingers, I don't view Young and Mata in this system as wingers, in my eyes you can't be inverted and be deemed as a winger) are supposed to be doing.

They seem to have been keeping their place, playing nearly the exact same way every game. One must have to assume it is what Van Gaal wants? It is getting extremely hazy trying to understand what Van Gaal wants in terms of his forward players.

Any megged pass over that kind of distance in my eyes is worthy. Considering the amount that Valencia hits the oppositions shins from similar positions. I feel that down playing the pass is harsh. I actually thought the little dart in behind the broken play was a very intelligent run as well, showing that in a transition play that he has the potential to be a dangerous player if we can just focus on creating some broken play with dynamic ball movement rather than sitting back waiting for it to happen high up the field. Or expending copious amounts of energy trying to force it.

218~~~
They do have another option. Shape to go inside, then go outside instead. Young actually does mix it up a bit. Mata almost never goes outside. Could probably remove "almost" from that sentence. 

I'm hazy on Van Gaal's expectations too but I've read that the whole purpose of all the possession football is to engineer a one v one so our creative players can express themselves. Unfortunately, only Ashley Young seems willing to try and dribble his opposite number, however ineffective that may be.

219~~~
Agreed about Young. I am not towing any line of abuse of his ability. But I see them both more as players who are optimal at <i>falling in line </i>with the possession football mantra of always keep the ball instead of needlessly giving it away. As opposed to being really good natural wide players who are being picked because of their devastating ability. It isn't a slight on either of them and I don't feel any hatred or excessive need to call for the axe.

But I honestly have no idea what they are even trying to do half the time. It literally makes no sense and I can only assume Van Gaal wants them to play that way, which in itself makes it even more puzzling.

220~~~
I like Ashley Young a lot. Hope he scores against Villa.

221~~~
I sometimes look at Young and think, given the same chances Nani would honestly create and score so much more. I can only think that Nani never applied himself in training. Because when it comes to taking on players and crossing/shooting, He is miles better than Young.

222~~~
Too adventurous for LvG. Hence why he removed very quickly.

223~~~
You're absolutely right. Some people just don't want to give any of our players any credit if they have made up their mind on them.

Young did really well to delay his run as well in order to stay onside for the through ball. It was great execution of fundamental football abilities.

224~~~
Thing is, even Fergy overlooked Nani for large periods. That's why I mention the training part, Nani must be an awful trainer because ability wise he has it all.

225~~~
Only in 12/13, where I think Nani picked up an injury or two. Although, Fergie trusted him in the biggest game of our season, that year.

226~~~
Agree with that. Young tried to take on Walker many times against Tottenham. Just that he failed pretty much everytime as all he does is put the ball past the player and try to run past him. Mata just isn't quick enough to even do or try that.

227~~~
The way he tried to go past Walker was ridiculous. Just putting the ball past a defender and trying to overtake him doesn't work too often. Walker had him in his pocket.
We had 2 (?!) successfull take ons during the whole of the game? This is a joke.

228~~~
It happens. Winger don't always get the better of fullback you know?

The last time we faced Spurs, he made Walker look like a clown. Has that been forgotten already?

229~~~
Yeah, he owned Walker the last time we played Spurs at Old Trafford. Made mincemeat of him. That was helped by the great support he got from Fellaini, of course. With Carrick and Schneiderlin both playing so deep it's no surprise that our wide men found it hard to get much joy but credit to Young for at least having a go.

230~~~
Except for the small matter of di Maria never helping out defensively at United.

231~~~
I'm not a fan of stats, over what I watch.
And for me, Young is our most effective attacker right now.

Which obviously is worrying.

We're using Mata in a way that he's only about 50% of his level, and Depay in that weird, just off, but mostly as a striker role was pure oddness.

Didn't like the look of it at all.

232~~~
No comments on Young being dropped at all? Weird.

233~~~
I'd prefer if he came on with 20-30 minutes left, and used his pace against a tired opposition.

234~~~
I imagine he will play on Tuesday.

235~~~
Forgot he even played yesterday, only had 10 minutes to do anything to be fair to him.

I'd like Memphis to be given more time on the left but I imagine we'll revert back to the usual lineup of Memphis as a #10 and Young out wide.

236~~~
I imagine he will feature tuesday against Brugge so he got a rest. Have a feeling that BFS and Fellaini will play as well.

237~~~
Do you think he might start tomorrow?  I know Memphis had the big game in leg 1 but we need to protect our lead and Young can give us added defence on the left.

238~~~
I think so, LvG's comment about needing to rotate makes me think him and one of Fellaini/Herrera will definitely start. Nervous for my line-up prediction, though. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

239~~~
You have to love our teams collective effort to make sure he doesn't get any assists.

Falcao truly has left his mark on our club.

240~~~
He whipped in one or two perfect balls last night begging to be put away <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

241~~~
Ye the cross he put in yesterday to Hernandez was perfect. Super ball. 

I also liked the way we set up when Young come on. Him and Memphis hugged the touchline and made the pitch very big against Brugge. This is how I want to see us set up in the future, with Herrera or Mata as the 10.

242~~~
Good to see Young play well on the right wing. Surprisingly, he has not done well earlier there. Always a prettier sight seeing him whip in a cross from the right than from the left

243~~~
Played well when he came on. Wouldn't be overly surprised if he started on the right against Swansea, especially since Montero plays for them on that side.

244~~~
He needs to step up his game, Memphis is only young and somebody needs to take the pressure off him or he needs to be moved to the right because even though Mata has been good that pace and dribbling still will give us another option on the right, Louis van Gaal is a good tactician last season he improved Young's performances through his tactics (use of Blind and Fellaini) and I'm sure he can do it again but Young needs to give him something to work with such as a cross that can find its man or a dribble that actually beats the player, or getting into those good positions and actually doing something. It can't be that hard.

Rooney also thrives off crosses and I think he would benefit from a natural wide player who hugs the line. 

But obviously he can't be given a match until he does something worthwhile.

245~~~
Earned the free kick which led to the opener. Young is nothing to get excited about but I've always been in his corner.

246~~~
Did ok, earned the free kick and tracked back better than Memphis.

247~~~
Changed the game really, we needed that first goal badly.

248~~~
Game changer and played ten times better than Memphis but for me it's something other that stands out with Ashley.

It's his connection to the club and understanding how much of a game this is for the fans. In the literal meaning. He was working his ass off, you could see that he was as determined to show that United is the better club as every single one of the fans in the stands. He was injured at some point, got himself back up and then attacked relentlessly all the time as well. This is the additional 10% that you'd expect from every player in games like this, against City, Leeds, Arsenal or Chelsea. You know that if Ash played 90 minutes today, he'd still sprint his ass off in the 9xth minute for the ball just to win it back, he'd do that definitely.

Same applied to Schweinsteiger today, he was chasing the ball like a fecking bulterrier. Shame same can't be said about Memphis, this is something the kid has yet to learn, if it can be learnt.

249~~~
Agreed. Also we seem to seriously under rate his ability to beat his marker. He seems to have the beating of any full back he's up against. Sure his final product is sometimes inconsistent and also he's not technically superior but he always has the beating of his fullback.

250~~~
His transformation under van gaal is staggering

251~~~
Shows he has genuine mental strength. He was certain to be sold after Moyes left fought and now has outperformed two big signings. His battle with Memphis still has a way to go but right now, he's the better player.

252~~~
Im not a fan of his but I thought he made a big difference today when he came on.  For all the things I perceive as his faults he really does come across to me as a player who goes out every game trying to do his best for the team and fans.

253~~~
Given his performances since Van Gaal took over, it's harsh that he's found himself on the bench. Credit to LVG for hauling Depay off today and putting Young on. He played very well and certainly impacted the result. It's a squad game and he'll see plenty of action this season, but I'd like to see a bit more of him in the coming weeks.

254~~~
By hook or by crook, he's still our best attacking player. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Seriously though, he was fantastic today. Didn't put a foot wrong, transformed our attack, and put in a massive shift defensively.

He has to be starting for now. Tbh, I'm not really sure why he was dropped in the first place. Memphis hasn't shown anything in the PL to warrant starting a head of him yet.

I've said it before, but he really does deserve massive credit for how he's turned his United career around. A few years ago I (like many others) really didn't like him (poor performances/diving) but his attitude and hard work has really turned it around. Well played Ashley. Probably my first attacking player on the team sheet right now.

255~~~
He's a much better option than Memphis currently. At least he attacks his fullback at every chance.

256~~~
MOTM for me. Blind was MVP. The freekick he won led to our first goal and he made the assist for Martial's clincher. How was he not MOTM?

257~~~
Always hustling and looking to challenge the opposition fullback. Continues to be impressive. Kept ADM out last season, might just push Memphis to do better.

258~~~
Calling that an assist is a perfect example that stats can be misleading. It's more like Martial assisted him to have the assist.

259~~~
An assist is an assist, how is it misleading? He was the part of the buildup and the last player to have the ball before the goal scorer. He could've taken a different option just to be safe and keep possession but he played a positive ball throughout. Young impacted the game more than any other

260~~~
MOTM over Blind? Are you serious?

261~~~
MOTM and MVP are two different things

262~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> bollocks

263~~~
Young was good and he's shown the manager he will provide a threat going forward much like he did last season. I think him down the right and Memphis on the left is an option he LVG has to take a look at - Young is capable of shooting as well with his left as well as taking on defenders out wide.

As for MOTM yesterday - has a small shout but, Blind was exceptional - he did a job on Benteke defensively, saved off the line at 1-0 twice and obviously scored the crucial opening goal. Makes Young shout for MOTM really really small.

264~~~
Did very well when he came on, and ended up offering more of a threat than Memphis. Will be interesting to see if he can work his way back into the starting 11.

265~~~
It's an assist but he didn't really do anything incisive. Normally with an assist you expect a great cross or a defense splitting pass but this was just a 5 yard pass out on the wing. I wouldn't call that a game changing action.

266~~~
Who got the assist for Giggsy goal against Arsenal?

267~~~
1999? idk.

268~~~
no one unless vierra counts

269~~~
Viera oh oh oh oh Viera oh oh oh oh <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

270~~~
How so? If he did not commit that pass then there would have been no goal.

271~~~
How?
An assist is the pass that led to the goal. No pass, no goal. It is just like how most of Higiaun's goals are tap-ins. Should we disregard almost all his goals because they were not 40 yard screamers? an assist is an assist.

272~~~
His final ball was lacking a bit sometimes but he was very good yesterday. It is always great how Ashley Young always does his best when it matters the most and last game proved it.

273~~~
You are just trying to prove the post you quoted. Yes it is an assist but assists like these prove that stats are very misleading.

Can you imagine the guy who played the pass to Messi - when he ran through the entire opposition to score perhaps one of the best solo goals ever - claiming to one and all that it was he who "assisted" Messi with that goal. He would be laughed out of any place.

274~~~
Strange thing to say, but he's one of my favourite players currently at United. The perfect squad player who never moans, takes his chance when he gets it and always does his best. Seems to be great in the dressing room too.

Changed the game for us on Saturday.

275~~~
To be fair though, it's only due to other peoples incompetance that Young doesn't have two assists already this season - so I think he deserves to have one to his name for the Martial goal.

276~~~
This. He used to be the first name popping to my mind when thinking about players who must be sold. But somehow LVG has turned him in to a very good squad player. Pretty much changed the game against Liverpool. What a difference a manager can make to some players.

277~~~
But but but hes a shit manager with poor man management skills

278~~~
Young seems to be the most reliable forward option we have (based on the last six months or so) and has a good recent record of playing an important role in the big matches. He is by no means the most gifted of our forwards (possibly the least) but his attitude and application has been exemplary since LVG took over and so it would be incredibly difficult to justify not starting him at the moment. 

The fact we play PSV next makes me think Memphis will start but we might see a bit or re-jigging in order to fit Young in somewhere. He should be first pick of the front four on merit IMO and we tend to look a better team with him on the pitch.

We just need to get him scoring more regularly, which he does have in his locker, as I seem to remember him getting a decent amount for Watford and Villa in the past but the goals have dried up these last few years.

279~~~
Ashley Young the striker?

Forwards James Wilson and Andreas Pereira have been added to the travelling squad, while Ashley Young has thrust himself into contention for a more prominent attacking role should Van Gaal require a further option up front.

“If the manager wants me to play there then yes, of course I would,” said Young. “I can play in lots of positions and I have done that under the manager, whether it is up front or in midfield.

“Hopefully I can play there [through the middle] but it's up to the manager.”

280~~~
Whether people think he deserves it or not its still officially an assist

281~~~
He used to be incompetent even at LW but now he is competent all over either flanks, in defence and even upfront. Plus he reduced his diving. Genuinely likeable guy now.

I don't see why people take it as insulting when Ashley Young happens to be a top player for us. He is more deserving than di maria imo.

282~~~
He deserved a new contract, that's all I have to say.

283~~~
Been a bit poor 1st half. Hopefully plays better in the 2nd half. His final ball is just so poor at times.

284~~~
We have tried him on the right a few times and he seems to struggle there. Looks a different player on the left, he can't cut back and cross it on when he plays on the right.

285~~~
He hits crosses too hard, sometimes a defter touch is needed.

Appears to have more impact from the bench too, which isn't exactly a bad skill to have.

286~~~
Final ball has let us down.

287~~~
Moved on the left for the second half, not a surprise. Can't play on the right, sadly.

288~~~
It has happened a lot with him.

289~~~
Not great but looked our most dangerous player in the second half.

290~~~
He looked hesitant Ashley at times.

291~~~
Yet contributed nothing, which is more or less his entire game at United.

He should have taken a pop in the first half but didn't. Piss poor on the whole.

292~~~
Good against Pool, poor tonight. He didn't create much and was not delivering good balls. Whatever is said here, he's a squad player, thats it

293~~~
The thing that frustrates me about Young is I just keep thinking that imagine we had a winger with his experience/maturity who could cross/pose a real attacking threat. Young works hard, links up well etc what he's doing is good in terms of idea but his end product is poor, and it's poor far too often. It's just so frustrating. I like him as part of the squad but I just can't believe they didn't think we needed a good experienced winger this summer. Would make such a difference to the attack.

294~~~
Unfortunately he was crap on the right, improved when moved to the left but just doesn't offer enough creativity or goal threat most of the time.

295~~~
I think it's a bit sad that he just can't get his head up while running , he gets into great positions but takes the most ridiculous option at times

296~~~
I don't know why he and Valencia hammer every cross, they have no variety or craft to their final pass. Although at least Young's goes past the first defender at least.

297~~~
Story of his life though. He just isnt good enough to be a starter for us compared to the other top clubs. His outcome is not good enough and the last two days were typical. He does so well against Pool and then is piss poor against PSV

298~~~
There was a point where he got played into the box and chose to cross instead of taking a shot or drilling a hand and low cross - that moment defined him as a player, he plays well in the build up to get into dangerous positions but seldom does anything meaningful at the crucial moment.

299~~~
That's generally a trait of a full-back. Replace Luke Shaw whilst he recovers?

300~~~
Traits of a full-back going forward. What about his defending?

301~~~
You would think he would be more effective on the right, crossing balls in with his right foot but he does look better on the left.

302~~~
Could be and I don't think he will be any worse than Valencia was on the opposite flank but I think defensively he will be a downgrade of sorts.

303~~~
Understatement that. 

I do think Young at LB and blind at CB can be used if we are chasing a game with the opponents camped in their own half.

304~~~
Is Young a life long United fan? Been watching a few interviews from him recently and he sounds like he absolutely bleeds United, kinda says a lot about his attitude and where he has come from in the last couple of years. That City performance at home was hands down one of our best individual performances of last year.

305~~~
Will be good for him to get 90mins against Ipswich.

306~~~
I like Young and would love to see him getting some regular game-time, but not as a defender, for the love of god.  I get using wingers as make-shift full-backs in the middle of a match when it's necessary, but not all the time, we proved nicely last season that it just doesn't work.  I'd rather Rojo coming in, even if he's at CB and Blind is LB (he's good at going forward too, so I'd personally prefer that).  There's always Blacket too, who I didn't think we bad when he was getting a few games last season.

307~~~
He was an Arsenal fan.

308~~~
Oh okay, fair enough.

309~~~
Best word to describe his performance tonight is responsible.

310~~~
Solid, disciplined. Pretty good for a winger, very mature.

311~~~
Came here to day these things.  Reassuring from the perspective of squad depth.  He does want van Gaal needs done.

312~~~
His passing is underrated. He can pass very well in fact. Not sure if he improved that over the past 2 seasons

313~~~
Good cameo. Should be starting ahead of Memphis.

314~~~
Excellent cameo. His link up down the channel was great. Took the fullback on and great cross for Mata.

315~~~
Really good effort, nice to have competition and options on the left

316~~~
Can be limited at times but he's solid. Honestly he should be ahead of Memphis on form right now.

317~~~
He's a brilliant squad player.

318~~~
I thought he was going to break that defenders ankles the way he was going at him.

319~~~
Looked sprightly when he came on, suits the utility sub role well.

320~~~
Felt a bit sorry for there right back... He'd just had a fairly laid-back 10 minutes with Depay tailing off a fair bit, then suddenly he had mad-man Ashley Young thrust up on him. He was running/dribbling at him like a man determined to make his 15 minutes count for something... and it did.

321~~~
Ashley messi today. Good game deserves to start over memphis Nani.

322~~~
He should start the next game IMO, did really well when he came on today.

323~~~
Such an odd player, was poor in his last start but great in the cameos against Liverpool and today. Think we should utilise him as a "super sub". Get him on in the last thirty as he can be a massive threat against tiring defenders.

324~~~
I don't think he was that good when he came on, he had many opportunities to cross and wasted all of them if I remember correctly.

325~~~
Young > Memphis

326~~~
...really?

327~~~
Well idk maybe I just have amnesia or something but I remember him having 3 crossing attempts and all of them being poor.

328~~~
Have you seen our last goal?

329~~~
ah I just seen it again, OK he done well there, maybe I was a bit too harsh on him <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

330~~~
I'd still start Memphis over Ashley Young.  As frustrating as Memphis' decision-making can sometimes be, he's still capable of coming up with something special.  Watching Young do the same dribble on the left, followed by a cross (or sometimes a dive), then rinse and repeat is mind-numbingly dull.  Granted, occasionally it can be effective.  Still would rather give Memphis more opportunities.

331~~~
Dude.....do yourself a favor and watch again

EDIT: You did, good man.

332~~~
Young has had chances starting in games to show what he can do but he hasn't taken them. He is more effective coming off the bench, fresh, and attacking a tired defence. The game time is better spent on Memphis who is still adapting.

333~~~
Young plays in the opposite way to memphis does.  I think defences just dont know how to approach the change after having 70mins of one and then 30 mins of the other.  On the other side; we do know what to expect when ashley young or fellaini comes on. 

Even if yoing starts i expect memphis to have a similar impact from the bench just purely because our team are well educated to tactics and tactical changes.

334~~~
I'm surprised this thread hasn't been bumped, I thought he was very good at RB, did well defensively and linked with Mata tidily up top.

335~~~
I'd rather see him at RB than Valencia, he's got as good an engine on him and better delivery when he does go up the field.

336~~~
He did well given the circumstances but he's not a serious option at full back. He doesn't have the awareness and that isn't really his fault.

337~~~
Christ knows how he's not in the team ahead of Memphis

338~~~
Love his attitude.

339~~~
Good from him today. Anyone but Valencia at RB please.

340~~~
I would rather have him at LB and Darmian at RB if he's going to play full back. Depay is better with good attacking help whilst Mata doesn't really need much to tick. Then again, Mata is better at tracking back so it might be easier on Young if he would be playing on the right.

It's a tough choice and I'm sure both Young and Valencia look good in training. It's hard to tinker now when it's been clear that Valencia was going to be competing for that RB stop. You don't suddenly transition from a LW to a RB. Can't forget how strong and quick Valencia is. He's also not one that wastes possession. All things considered I don't think he's done enough to lose his position.

341~~~
He's got a fantastic attitude. Couple of cracking crosses too.

342~~~
Not very good in the first half.

343~~~
He's left completely exposed by Memphis.

344~~~
I feel incredibly bad for him and Valencia. Playing in defense is not ideal for either, yet our manager cant fecking see that. Would it have killed to just keep Rafael!?!?!

345~~~
He's not a fullback. Let's play fullbacks at fullback.

346~~~
I don't get the low rating for him, he was hung out to dry by the midfield and Memphis in the first half playing out of position on the wrong side, but he worked tirelessly all game and didn't give up.

347~~~
Should be our 1st choice left winger.

348~~~
good grief....
He cant cross to save his life, 1 in 20 deliveries find one of our players. He has absolutely no left foot and most of the time cuts in on to his right which is predictable and also slows up any momentum going forward. he very very rarely actually makes it to the byline. Today everytime he tried to go forward he was simply shown the line by a smart fullback who knew he had no left foot. We need a new left and right wing in the squad. He was awful today, just awful.

349~~~
You are going well overboard with I'll just put that down to the result tonight and ask if you believe Memphis Depay is better at the moment. Is he?

350~~~
Depay can beat his man and deliver a cross. Depay has had a string of bad games but if Young is the answer then we are fecked.  Nothing to do with this result. Young hasnt performed as a winger should for 2-3 seasons now.  
How many times did Young beat his man today?. How many times did Young find one of our players with a cross today?
How many times did Young cut in and then lay off a square ball?.

351~~~
Depay has been horrible for us ever since he got here. Young was our best attacking outlet last season who won us a bunch of big games.

352~~~
Are you deliberately missing the point? Young and Memphis are our only 2 options atm unless we are somehow signing a top left winger in Oct. 

 Memphis has done a grand job of beating his man and putting crosses in so far btw. Absolutely poor for a while now.

353~~~
Please play him on the Left wing.

No left foot and yet his last assist for us (which was all of 1 week ago) was with his left foot. Stop talking complete and utter shite for once.

354~~~
HA, lets see if you have the balls to go check out if that was a 1 in 100 chance. He is utter shite with his left, he very rarely finds his man, virtually always cuts in on to his right. Its repeat and rinse but some people are just completely blind to it.  Maybe I should do a "all touches" video of his efforts today for you?

355~~~
He has a favoured foot. Shock. Horror. 

That isn't the same as saying he doesn't have a left foot ffs. 

You are yet to answer my question btw. Do you believe Memphis is better atm?

356~~~
No one is blind to anything except you towards Young (no left foot lol). I bet you were gutted when he was playing so well last season eh. fecking pathetic.

He should start ahead of Depay. Quite comfortably the better player.

357~~~
The only way he can play left back is if we cloned if and played him on the left wing. 200% energy and effort.

358~~~
We missed him today. Was brilliant in the game last year and him on the left would've enabled us to play Martial up top. Definitely our best options while Memphis is still finding his feet and Rooney is shit.

359~~~
When is he back? I'm hoping we move Martial back up top with Young on the left once he's fit again.

360~~~
Means dropping Herrera though... I'd prefer having Herrera in the XI tbh.

361~~~
Why? I don't think Van Gaal can keep up this charade of playing with 10 footballers and a captain for too long.

362~~~
Van Gaal doesn't like Herrera as it is. Dropping Rooney is extremely unlikely, dropping Rooney for the sake of keeping Herrera in the team is expecting the impossible.

363~~~
I don't think that's the case. He has commented about Herrera doing very well recently. I do agree he seems to have a blind spot for Rooney which is shocking coming from Mr Big Balls but I don't think it's that unrealistic to see Herrera take over as the #10 permanently even if it's Rooney that gets shoehorned their again initially.

364~~~
I never thought I'd see the day that I'd be looking forward to Young's return <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The problem, though, is it will probably be for Herrera.

365~~~
His turnaround has been amazing under Van Gaal.

366~~~
Hopefully Van Gaal gives Rooney a "rest" next week if Young is ready to start. 
 A very good all round team, nobody being carried in any sense (other then Mata defensively a bit but even then it's not bad), and a consistent and reliable threat going forward from all of them.

367~~~
Actually I think Bastian is probably the more likely to get dropped to accomendate Young. 

Herrera's form/tactical discipline and LVG's appreciation could mean he'll favour a Schneiderlin/Herrera 2 man midfield with turdsh|t ahead of them.

368~~~
I'd love to see Herrera in a 2 man midfield with schneiderlin because it should work in a vast majority of our league games but can't see van Gaal doing it unfortunately.

369~~~
Put in a shift, gave it his all etc.....

370~~~
Terrible penalty, I think he missed one for us in pre season a couple of years back too. I'm surprised he used to be the main taker at Villa and the majority of those he scored.

371~~~
He's not a fullback, and shouldnt be used there. 

LVG should have actually went out and signed fullback cover, seeing as we only have two proper fullbacks, and the rest being makeshift players being played out of their favoured positions.

372~~~
Should be starting if fit.. at least on current form.
Only one who wants to run at teams...

Also, is pretty smart. Did well defensively.. didnt look lost.

373~~~
Should have started

374~~~
Well, apart from Martial.

375~~~
One of the only positives from today's match.

376~~~
He's a real fighter.

377~~~
Get him in this snail pace side as a winger. At least he actually gets the ball into the other half.

He's not a fullback, but it was nice to see someone attack after the complete no show attacking wise from our two fullbacks on the pitch.

378~~~
I was right about him!<img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>..I'd rather have him in the team that any primadonna new signing that wont give a proper shift.

379~~~
Made some good runs, and positioning was also good when defending.

380~~~
He needs to be played as a winger, I know his end product is dodgy but we need someone down the wings trying to make something happen. He's direct, he'll try and take on a fullback(sort of), just put him there.

381~~~
That is far too conventional

382~~~
Yeah true, he'd need to cut in and move into the over crowded central midfield area before turning around slowly and passing the ball backwards or passing it sideways into the area he's supposed to be in.
#philosophy

383~~~
It is a process you see. 

He'll persist until either someone gets injured and then when it gets better , he'll tell us the philosophy is working. It happened last season with the fantastic duo of Falcao and RVP, and Herrera being benched.

384~~~
Who ever thought that Ashley Young would become one of the few shining beacons of hope in the Manchester United squad.

Good cameo, actually appears to care about the result and will probably be up there in the MOM poll. 
Seems to be the norm in these crazy days of LVG.

385~~~
Nailed down a start at RB on Tuesday, not only did he add more to our attack but he was defensively better than Darmian.

386~~~
Were it not for De Gea's heroics Young would be my MOTM.

387~~~
Bloody hell - nothing against him, but all Young did was stand up and had the courage to run at defenders. He also made off the ball runs and looked to pass it forward. It's really something that should be the minimum for any United player but today it felt like he was Ronaldo. Credit to Young, but shame to almost everyone else.

388~~~
He was excellent today.

389~~~
Nah Valencia will get that, don't want him handling musa tbh. I want young on the LW with martial up top.

390~~~
Isn't Valencia injured?

391~~~
He had a bang on the foot, don't think it's anything serious. I would imagine he will be OK unless he has broken something.

392~~~
He's fast becoming my favourite player. Unbelievable turn around <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

393~~~
It really is mindblowing. He's gone from being a player many of us never wanted to see again in a United shirt to being one of the most reassuring presences on the pitch.

394~~~
The way Young's been marginalised this season is something else to add to the long list of black marks against Van Gaal. He was arguably the only United player creating anything in the last few game of last season, then one of the only decent performers in pre-season. He should not have been dropped and every time he does get minutes he reminds Van Gaal of this. Yet he still isn't starting games. 

The fact that it's Ashley fecking Young who is so badly missed - after spending a quarter of a billion quid - is another black mark btw.

395~~~
He should start from now on as RB, Darmian has been poor and should be back up option for both fullback spots... Young is not a natural defender but he's smart enough to cover many positions, once he gets more games under his belt there, he can be really a valuable player. It was a great spell from Yong last game, showed good contribution going forward and  mainly great positioning sense when defeinding which is promising.

Like someone said, he's becoming one of my favourite players, he started to turn it around when he was at the game in the stands with Fletch actually.

396~~~
This is true but wasn't he injured recently? Young should have his best position locked down, with Martial playing as the line striker and then maybe we can blood in Lingard/Perreira on the right side because let's face it Mata hasn't been influential enough on the right. But all this will come to naught if we do not raise our tempo, alter our tactics and take a few risks with the ball.

397~~~
He's not a defender, and that would just expose him especially when facing proper attacking talent. What he is however is the best performing winger at this club, and should be the no. 1 choice there. During last year's run in he was our best player.

What does he get as a thank you, being dropped for an undercooked Memphis and told he's no Neymar(Very few players in this world are).

398~~~
We need a quality coming from fullbacks as our build up is too patient so we need attacking threat or something extra from all positions so if Smalling can carry the ball away be a threat on corners, Blind can pass, than fuullbacks need to put in quality crosses, overlap "wingers" and create something. Darmian is dare going forward, he actually looks like he can't even make 5m pass, control the ball and can't dribble at all, young is good option there. Yes he can be valuable from flanks when on form but is the fattie up top going to be benched any time soon? 

And if we have quality on wings, Young is a good attacking option from fullback, as I said he's clever player qho can adjust, he's brain unlike Valencia...

btw the gme agains Arsenal hen Young was found out was a bit harsh game for him as Carrick with Sweinsteigger were totally destroyed in midfield as expected and the whole defense was having a mere maybe apart Smalling but Blind and Darmian were even worse IMO and it's more natural position for them..

If it was me, I'd bench Rooney immidiately and give start to Pereira from the left, Lingard from the right, Young as RB, Darmian can't play next game anyway, he's got fifth yellow, if Valencia doesn't recover, we will be forced to play someone from academy, oh that would be too good if we actually gave a chance to Varela, but dreams don't happen these days, in that moment I'd like Young to start from the LW position..

399~~~
You make good points, although somethings like Rooney being dropped or Varela evidently wont happen.

As for the attacking fullback, I agree and this  is another case of us missing Shaw very badly. But didnt we suffer from the same thing last season, such that we should have solved this problem in the Summer? Thats on the manager.

400~~~
He's having a very good game. He's making the kind of impact we were all expecting when Valencia played there.

401~~~
He's been good  for the last 18 months to be fair. Should never have been benched at the start of the season.

402~~~
I'd like to see him up front again on the left. Probably wasted as a fullback now.

403~~~
Just play him on the left instead of Lingard - And play Darmian as the Right back. We'll score at least 3-4 if he plays in his preferred position

404~~~
This is the obvious change.

405~~~
He's been incredible.

406~~~
Been our best threat in the first half.

407~~~
Thought he was our best player first half, only Schweinsteiger and Smalling even close.

408~~~
Darmian on and Young on the left? Think we may have scored if we'd have started like that.

409~~~
The most unfair treated player in the squad by van Gaal (bar Rooney maybe).

410~~~
His positivity is underrated. More of that shit is what we need at the moment.

411~~~
Last season he strangely got a lot of stick on the Caf, when in many games I thought he was our best player.
Thing with Young is the number of times he tries to penetrate one way or another, god knows we've needed more of that this season.

412~~~
Shame about the dive, but he simply must be in the team. 

I'd love to see Lingard on the right and Young on the left. Some real pace and players that take a man on both flank.

413~~~
I think you are right. He contributes a lot in attack and defense. Has been overlooked for selection too often this year.

414~~~
I gave him MOTM as I thought he was our most consistently good player over the 90 minutes.

415~~~
Thought he was good especially in the first half and that dive was simply cringetastic.

416~~~
Cringe dive but desperate times...

Will let him off considering the great performance.

417~~~
I did too.

Was surprised to see him so far down the MOTM list. Even Rooney and Rojo came higher

418~~~
Right now he should be a starter every game, I don't really care which of his many positions we start him in but it is indefencible to not have him in the team one way or another.

419~~~
Has put in successive good performances.  Loved his energy and enterprise tonight, even if that dive was cringeworthy.  

Glad LVG is finding a place in the team for him, but Id rather he play at left wing where is is most experienced.  

Delighted for him that LVG has found a way to utilise his talents and find a meaningful role for him.  Proof that unfashionable players can also do well if they commit to real hard work and lienth to their manager.  He will be required a lot more this season and he is doing great so far.

420~~~
so many calls for Darmian. WHy? He's been averaage overaall, Young looks good aas RB, let him have more games there. expecttions from winger are higher. Lingard has done fairly well, so let him have one side and give the other to pereira/Herrera/martial if rooney needs to play. We need attacking threat from fullback as well, certainly not someone like Daarmian who needs to take some time off..

421~~~
The strangest thing for me was the reaction to his contract renewal just months ago. He's a great squad player.

<a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/threads/ashley-young-agrees-new-3-year-contract.407587/">http://www.redcafe.net/threads/ashley-young-agrees-new-3-year-contract.407587/</a>

422~~~
One of the most creative players in the squad. Perhaps the <i>most </i>creative, in fact. And has been for a while.
And obviously he's very well-rounded.

423~~~
Ridiculously underrated. Miles better than Darmian.

424~~~
That's the confirmation bias that plagues this place. Once a lot of people decide someone is crap it takes a series of Messi class performances to earn even grudging praise. Anything less and they get slagged off, no matter how well they play.

425~~~
He's been a revelation since Van Gaal came in.

I absolutely love his attitude - he seems to love playing for us. Just wish he'd cut the diving out (well, the unsuccessful diving anyway <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>).

Great performance defensively again apart from that slip which Mike luckily had covered - I think he might have got to the ball anyway but glad we didn't have to find out.

426~~~
Should be seen as a key player and probably should start every week. Just question is if he should play on the left, right, or at fullback. Always puts in a good shift though. Once darmian gets back in form/Valencia gets fit, he should just be a mainstay on the left. Martial up top, Rooney behind martial and young left gives us a very good balance.

427~~~
Not bad for a certain deadwood labelled by the majority in here not so long ago.

Our best utility player these days.

428~~~
Maybe he'll be England's left back for the Euros

429~~~
not a bad shift as a make-do right back!

430~~~
I think he should play at full back in those matches that we're expected to dominate.The likes of Rojo and Darmian,while can be more solid defensively,would never have contributed offensively as much as Young did and with the current United team there will always be needs for attacking threats from outside the front 4.

431~~~
Valencia is injured.

Keane calling his dive a disgrace and I agree with him, needs to stop it.

432~~~
True, and true ... not sure why you quoted me though.

433~~~
I think he's better there than Tony V.

434~~~
Royston not impressed with the dive



Least he said we weren't a boring team I suppose

435~~~
Hes right though in terms of the diving.

436~~~
Odd analogy from Keane.

437~~~
Keeps on sticking it to the naysayers. 

I was one of them before last season. A top professional and intelligent player with underrated technical ability.

438~~~
Its not even his worse dive, everytime he does it people are up in arms. When other players are constantly doing it in other teams, no one gives a shit. I'm just glad he's been playing well, because that is the best response he can give them.

439~~~
I like  him and feel he has turned his career around here, but that dive is disgraceful. The fact that two managers at united have already publically rebuked him about this and yet he still does it is worrisome.

440~~~
Young should stop diving. We have disgraces like Costa in the league to do diving, kicking, punching etc.

441~~~
This.

Don't understand the logic of people going in on Young, as if he is the only player in the universe who goes down easily. 

Diving is present from the top to the bottom of the Premier league. It's even more prevalent in Europe. Why should Young be made the scapegoat for it?

442~~~
I don't like diving but honestly I don't really care if he does it, the only reason I don't want him doing it too much is he'll get a reputation and when he actually is fouled he won't get the call. Tbh though, if he wins us a penalty and we win the game I couldn't give a feck if it was a dive or not.

443~~~
I, for one (and I'm guessing others as well), react negatively to any United player taking a dive or going down easily. Just because others do it doesn't mean we should just quietly accept it. It's cheating, plain and simple, and I really don't like our players doing it. It's bad enough that everyone and their dog thinks United get special favors from the refs and the FA, we don't need our players throwing themselves all over the pitch. Young has been one of our worst offenders on that front, and as such has been given a rough ride for it. It doesn't help that several of his attempts have been really blatant either.

The fact that fans, United or otherwise, react negatively to their own players trying to cheat is a positive, and I don't understand the logic of people questioning it. Isn't it a sign of integrity?

Do note that I don't dislike Young or anything, I just wish he'd stop going down so easily.

444~~~
Playing very well and deserves to start perhaps he'll go to right wing and Valencia will slot in behind him lol after all the players we bought these two stalwarts still end up playing. Says a lot both ways.

445~~~
Part of the blame for the whole diving or theatrical falling should go to the Refs. If I remember the rule book, it says something about the intention to foul being punished by the Ref. But the refs never do this. Unless they see a hard fall, none of them point to the spot.

446~~~
So when the ball goes out and, regardless who it came off, all our players appeal for it are you ashamed? 

Scholes punched the ball into the net in the European super cup final. Yes he got caught and sent off. But had he got away with it would you think less of Scholes? 

What about the well documented advise Sir Alex gave the Nevilles on Reyes in 2004/05? Were you ashamed by the systematic fouling? Deliberate fouling is also cheating right? 

Ashley Young does nothing thousands of others don't do. Singling him out is ridiculous. When sideshow Bob was laughing his a$$ off at getting Rafael sent off a few years back, was anyone crying for United? Sometimes you fight fire with fire. 

Young has been a solid performer for us under Van Gaal. We should be praising him, not hanging him out to dry.

447~~~
Young deserves praise for playing well, and id like to see him, Memphis and Martial as front three with Mata in behind.

448~~~
He's here to play football, not to cheat. It's as simple as that for me.

449~~~
It was an embarrassing dive and he should cut it out, but the reaction to it is even more embarrassing for me. Rooney dived just before that and it was barely even mentioned. It wasn't subtle either - it was a blatant dive, seconds after contact had taken place where he just fell to the ground. In Young's time here Rooney has undoubtedly dived more often for me...but Young gets painted as a serial diver for a couple of "high profile" dives while it's never mentioned of Rooney. Bizarre.

450~~~
We have praised his perfomances, but you cant praise diving. Where does it stop? Just because someone else does it doesn't make it right. That is exactly managers have publically slammed him for this before. If this was a Liverpool player doing it, we'd be up in arms. I like to think that we are good enough to win without resorting to this sort of thing.

451~~~
We all know that Rooney is treated differently, both by the media and the club. But it doesnt make it right, its just true.

452~~~
Jesus Christ, why so confrontational?  I never said I thought less of Young, it's just an aspect of his game I wish we'd see less of. In fact, it's an aspect of the game itself that I'd wish to see less of.

I wouldn't think less of Scholes either, but I certainly don't want to win by cheating. If we win as a direct result of one of our players taking a dive, or punching a ball into the net, it would certainly ruin the win for me. I don't want us to win like that.

You can't even begin to compare diving to going in hard on a player. Sir Alex told the Nevilles to go in hard on Reyes, in order to throw him off his game. He did not tell them to kick him about or rough him up. Playing cynically and deliberately fouling high up the pitch to prevent the opposition from getting into dangerous areas is a legitimate tactic, and doesn't involve trying to deceive the ref. Players are often carded for persistent fouling. So no, I was neither ashamed, nor did (or do) I consider deliberate fouling to be cheating.

The fact that thousands of others does it just goes to show how big the problem is. The fact that others do it is also a pretty shite defense of what is, by every definition, cheating. And I'm not singling him out, I'll criticize any United player that does it. Young just happens to be one of Uniteds worst offenders, so he gets called out more often than others. And I couldn't care less how other teams or players go about it, I just know how I'd like to see US go about it.

Criticizing Young for simulating does not prevent me from thinking he's been one of our better performers under van Gaal, the two are not mutually exclusive.

453~~~
Well said.

454~~~
Yeah, I'm the same. In all of the many things about modern football/footballers that annoy me, diving is pretty low down the list.

455~~~
Bit of an older racist term from Keane there as well.

I don't like the diving at all, it is a bit embarrassing for football in general really, it's grown men throwing themselves on the floor. Young isn't the only 1 who does it though. People like Gerrard were serial divers and never got mentioned cos they were 1 of England's golden boys.

456~~~
But Young is the only one I can think of that dives so theatrically. This somersault, others fall easily to the ground but he's playing a different game, more obvious and more prone to being called out on.

457~~~
I'm not being confrontational, I just can't believe people are making a massive issue of it. Herrera dived against Palace, no response. Rooney dived in the same game I think, no response. So why do people want to make a massive issue of Ashley Young going down softly?

Exactly. Low level cheating like trying to win set pieces, conning the ref at throw ins and so on, are the least of football's problems. Sticking it to Ashley Young isn't eliminating the kind of unpunished X-rated tackles that have cost us our first XI left back are they?

Thank you for making the point. <a class="username" data-user="64360, @drdoityourself" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64360/">@drdoityourself</a> the way Gerrard dives, flinging his arms out like a starfish, how is that any less theatrical? It is so obvious and yet its never spoken about because he's "Stevie G". When its Ashley Young though people are acting like he's smote the first born of Egypt.

458~~~
I missread <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

459~~~
He showed a lot of situational awareness there and should be praised. I look at his dive like a rain dance during a goal drought. It worked.

460~~~
The madness of diving is that players cannot get away with it anymore. Even if they do get a penalty or free kick, there are tons of cameras around the place and you will be picked up on it and will get the screw turned on you for it. 

It's almost as if footballers aren't the brightest <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

461~~~
Many footballers dive and don't have a reputation for it in the media. Even Messi dives - he gets his goals/assists and moves on. Why should he care about a billion cameras if it makes no difference?

462~~~
Jesus, that's way over the top from Keane. I don't like the diving at all and hope he cuts it out, but labelling him a disgrace is just uncalled for.

463~~~
It's Keane...He still thinks he's a failure at times. Odd man

464~~~
Solid performance, guessing he came off to give Jones some minutes.

465~~~
Some crafty malarkey today.

466~~~
Could have cost us when he switched off but did well with his "tactical fouls"

467~~~
Why were their fans booing him? He didn't leave on bad terms IIRC. Seems very small time.

468~~~
I heard boos near the end, probably because they thought Young was time wasting when he had that injury scare.

469~~~
Sat in the home end thanks to a mate, He was cheered at the beginning when they read his name out on the team sheets, it was when he started to go down at every opportunity that they started to turn on him, alot of fans chanting "cheat, cheat, cheat" he was very poor i thought, stood out at the worst in the team tbh

470~~~
He also gave the ball away after receiving the ball from Herrera and turning to pass back to De Gea, which led to a counter. Most of our players were in advanced positions, so that was a poor decision. Otherwise he's been doing well recently IMO.

471~~~
He was lively when he came on and followed his instructions as usual.

472~~~
Thought he was initially a decent attacking threat when he came on. Put in some good crosses. Didn't do much after that though.

473~~~
Some half decent crosses when he came on but what's the use when Fellaini's 30 yards behind you.

474~~~
Put in two really dangerous crosses which nobody bothered to try an attack, then made the only decent run in the entire second half and created the Lingard chance due to it... then he got shifted to right back, probably because he was trying to be too positive.

475~~~
Van Gaal didn't have a recognised full back to sub on, so he did the next best thing in order to satisfy his need to sub Darmian off.

476~~~
McNair was warming up for a bit... I think I genuinely would have lost my shit if he had come on at right back.

477~~~
Should be starting ahead of Depay on that left side, bringing him on tonight was the right decision but unfortunately the Fellaini for BFS sub accompanied it which meant it didn't have the affect it should of.

478~~~
Yeah, really should be first choice on the left. Once we made the sub our wide players just didn't get the ball though so that made it hard for him.

479~~~
He's good and an asset to our squad. He definitely should be starting ahead of Delay on the left but I'm starting to wonder if Memphis should be blooded as a CF anyway.

480~~~
Playing him in different positions won't make him a better player.

481~~~
He messes up so many chances when he gets into good positions. Not sure how he got a 3 year extension

482~~~
Somehow is playing worse than Rooney and Carrick.

483~~~
He's shit. Along with pretty much the rest of them.

484~~~
He's our best winger and he's still shite.

485~~~
It's quite amazing that in Valencia and Young we have to full-backs who play full-back because they were too shite to play as wingers. But yet everyone acts surprised when they're shit going forward.

486~~~
We have a lot of these types of players...good enough for a 6th place club, but nowhere near good enough for a team who is supposed to be one of the biggies.

487~~~
People love him because he tries hard but today is an example of why he gets so few assists every season.

488~~~
Wouldn't get into any lg the top teams. To have a player like him that can't get past his man in your starting line up says a freaking lot

489~~~
Young and Martial have been our only genuine threats. Better than Memphis last game. Where the feck is this criticism coming from?

490~~~
So many mistakes on both ends but his flank is where our only threat comes from.

491~~~
His defending for Vardy's goal was absolutely shocking. Surely we could see that move coming a mile off ?

492~~~
I agree. Young is the only one threatening to put anything into the box.

493~~~
It might be his flank, but it's not him doing the threatening. He's terrible. God knows why so many pine for him on here when Memphis plays badly. He's just as bad - oh no, wait, his crosses "look" better.

494~~~
They do. Bet you hated his cross to Schweinstieger for his free header at the start of the second half too.

495~~~
Yeah, knew that'd bite me on the arse. Meh, still think he's shit. And he is.

496~~~
Crosses for the sake of crossing. He'll hit 1 out every 10 or 15 he attempts.

497~~~
I thought he was pretty good today. His crossing was put into good positions and unlucky that there was no one there to put the ball in the net. But he did get caught out for the first goal.

498~~~
As bad as he's been since the Moyes Era.
Abysmal.

499~~~
He occasionally looks threatening and dangerous, but then just whips in an awful cross to remind you he's shit.

500~~~
He's as average as they come really. The quality we lack up front is absolutely ridiculous at the moment.

501~~~
The quality of crossing from this winger is absolutely shocking.

502~~~
It was probably the worst I've seen him play for a while but he played that whole flank on his own. That formation was a farce.

503~~~
If we going to challenge or win the premier league again players like this can't be starters for us.

He'd get us at least 5 assists per season if we lucky. He just crosses it without looking for a man.

504~~~
What the feck is the point of crossing into a good area? It's as pointless as it gets.

505~~~
TBF its not his fault that we rely entirely on him to create chances. He's always been an inconsistent crosser and passer and we've known this for a while. The fact that most of our attacks seem to go through him is ridiculous.

506~~~
Average footballer, good guy.

507~~~
He is our best winger

That tells you everything about the quality we have on the wings.

Our main source of chance creation is Ashley Young.

508~~~
Somehow managed to play worse than Rooney today. That's impressive.

509~~~
The blind crosser, he never actually tries to pick out players. Just areas of the box where there is not necessarily anyone.

510~~~
Shame he can't get past his man to save his life.

511~~~
Nope, it's not. van Gaal takes most, if not all, the blame.

512~~~
This is said after every game he plays, our players can't cover each square inch of the box so I think it's more important to find a United head with the cross than to put it into space where there is noone.

Angel di Maria was poor last season but he managed to find players so it is possible.

513~~~
Again I thought he was good today apart from the goal. I wafch different footy to you lot.

514~~~
There's not much he could have done with little support on the wing and facing two defenders.

515~~~
In the past 3.5 seasons he has something like 8 goals and 10 assists in total for us. It's not just bad luck that no one ever gets on the end of his crosses.

516~~~
Yeah, I think everyone got that by now.

517~~~
He got in to good positions quite often but didn't show enough quality to be effective.

518~~~
That's the thing: he can sometimes look dangerous, but almost always finds a way to feck it up.

519~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

I really like Ash.

520~~~
This.

19 assists in 130 games for United.

I've said it before in here. His delivery is often decent, but his crossing isn't very good (if that makes sense). Happens a lot where he puts the ball into the box, sure it may have been dangerous if we had a player there, but more often than not he's finding no one, or a defender.

521~~~
There's no one there!
Why we don't have people rushing the box I don't know!

522~~~
He's about as 1 dimensional in the final 3rd as you'll ever see, I don't really have anything negative to say about him, he plays with heart and to the best of his ability, he's just never been anything special and isn't suddenly going to become a top player at 31.

523~~~
Absolutely. Unless he has acres of space in front of him his head will be down the whole time. He just crosses to the far post like he expects Fellaini to be there every time.

524~~~
He's a bang average player and the fact he's a starter at us normally shows how bad standards have fallen.

525~~~
Would of been much better on the right for us today. Darmian had acres of space going forward and didn't do anything with it, while Young being naturally a winger may have created something. He was neutralised on the left and was far too predictable, it also would not of disrupted the dynamic of our play with Darmian also being right footed on the left like Young.

526~~~
Young is pretty shit on the right. He might be right footed but he's played on the left his whole career. On the left he can cut back and cross with his right foot. He doesn't do that on the right wing.

527~~~
Agreed. He also has that nutmeg down well from the left as a sort of counter move when he decides t to not cut back and goes hard down the left wing. That's 3 decent moves he has on the left that he just has no equivalent of on the right.

528~~~
There's plenty of times he gets in good positions with plenty of space but delivers a cross/pass that is way off the mark or hits the first man.

We all know he's an average player who can do a job but when he is your main creative outlet you have a problem. As I said before, I don't blame him. I blame our tactics and style that require him to be the main creative outlet.

529~~~
At the end when he could have passed it along the floor to Schweinsteiger but instead just shot it into the air riled me right up.

530~~~
At least he tries to take on his man these days. Thought he was one of our better players, even though not great by any means. Good squad player, but we need better.

531~~~
And you wanted him gone. From Watford to Villa to United, I admire that career trajectory.

532~~~
He's not a poor player, he's just not very good and never has been. He's a perfect squad player to slot in when you're down with injuries but he should never be starting important matches.

533~~~
He's playing every third or fourth game on average tbf and in different positions. When he had a run in the side last season he was good, not great, but solid. It's hard for any player in that situation.

534~~~
He's just not good enough to be a starter

535~~~
He's pissed in LvG's cornflakes.

536~~~
Baffling

537~~~
Has to be injured. Otherwise should be a guaranteed starter currently.

538~~~

539~~~
Never thought I would be saying it but could really do with him at the moment.

540~~~
Hopefully fully fit for weekend - crying out for him and Herrera to return

541~~~
Young on the left Depay on the right, Martial up front Rooney or Mata behind.

542~~~
What's going on here then? Did he invite Victor to the Christmas party of something?

543~~~
Perhaps he was the "I'm half the player...."

There is no other explanation. We have half a team out, can't score goals or defend and one of our best players from last season just can't get any minutes. It doesn't make any sense.

544~~~

545~~~
It's only been 3 games and he's not very good. Case solved

546~~~
He should be playing on the wing if Mata starts in the middle. I'm rather happy we are developing Varela as a legitimate back up right back option and he hasn't let anyone down yet. Even if Darmian gets fit I'd rather see him stick to left back and keep Varela in the main squad. Young can split time with Memphis and Lingard on the wings.

547~~~
I like him, but I hate the fact he's taking up Januzaj's place in the squad.

548~~~
I wonder if he's "half s player".

549~~~
No because what we saw from Ashley is what we saw under Ferguson.

Cuts back on his right foot and overhit cross after another. Doesn't look where he crosses just aims it where our players aren't. Oh and the odd dive.

550~~~
He's on cloud nine, if he thinks he should be a key play for us.

551~~~
That doesn't mean he isn't the one who thinks he's half a player.

552~~~
I feel like he has lost his place in the team and as a sub because of poor performances at fullback. Which is absolutely crazy.

553~~~
But he has been one of our better attacking players (not too hard at the moment) and would make sense to bring him on ahead of the likes of Powell. Heck, he can fit in at left back. It's just strange that he had minutes when we didn't have injuries and now we are ravaged with injuries and he can't get a look in.

554~~~
The only attacking position he has shown he can solve is the left winger position. Even though Depay is a somewhat frustrating player he's shown he creates more danger than Young. That run behind the defence and the take down to create our goal against Bournemouth was something you'd never see from Young. It is understandable when we're struggling with chance creation and goals, that van Gaal looks to other options than Young, who quite simply doesn't offer any end product.
I was also a little surprised he didn't get a look in at left back, but both Varela and Borthwick-Jackson were good against Wolfsburg and it would have been demoralizing to be dropped after that, for someone who isn't even a natural in that position.
We've got plenty of problems, but I'm afraid Young isn't the answer to any of them.

555~~~
I doubt he thinks that but given our injury crisis in the past few matches, surely he would have been a more reliable and straightforward option than Varela/CBJ? Not that I don't appreciate seeing youngsters playing in the first team, but I don't think a high pressure do-or-die European game against Wolfsburg away and the away game against Bournemouth, where our squad was ravaged with injuries and down on morale, were the ideal conditions to integrate youngsters into the first team.

I would much rather we develop promising youngsters, than play a decent at best squad option in Young, but I think Young would have been much more suitable for the past two matches than both the inexperienced youngsters.

556~~~
agreed fully.

557~~~
Our best attacking outlet, put in some good crosses.

558~~~
Not a RB and obviously didnt read the run for their second goal. I dont blame him, hes not a RB.

Dont see why we cant play him where he was in form last season (and had his best match against City).

559~~~
Fully agree, especially the second part. It's not as if our wingers have been outstanding to point where he can't get a game. I gave him MoTM and he deserved better from the crosses he put in. But he's not a full back and the mistakes today and at Leicester show that, like you though I don't blame him really.

560~~~
Very strange that he's now only just been put back in the team, makes me wonder if someone went on behind the scenes.

561~~~
Was good to see him back in the side, thought he did well.

562~~~

563~~~
Decent performance from him which is better than the rest produced. He was running that right wing himself in the second half.

564~~~
Our best player today, both going forward and defensively.

565~~~
Apart from the stupid handball, he was one of the better players again. One of a few who cares. Not a right back though and hopefully he's in Memphis' or Mata's place when one more defender is back.

566~~~
He was one of our best players last season playing on the left wing. He couldn't have played in that position more than two or three times this season. It's bonkers.

567~~~
Should have started the game on the left wing. Class player that's unfortunately been dicked around. If only the rest of the team had half the heart he showed today.

568~~~
Our best outfield player and that's not exactly a compliment, but there ya go.

569~~~
It is never good news when he is our best player.

570~~~
Was good today.

571~~~
It's a bit like when Wenger said that it was infuriating how every time they played, the opposition goalie was motm. It wasn't untrue either, nor is your argument. He does well, but giving 100% is to be expected of every player - not something we should have to applaud from one player.

572~~~
We shouldn't do that for sure but it's what we're reduced to nowadays. I like Young, players like him are always useful.

573~~~
Only player that doesn't have to hide his head in shame after today.

574~~~
He's a fantastic squad player to have, but he should be used exclusively on that left side or as a ten. He could also have been used as a right winger today, Mata in the middle and Herrera alongside Carrick/Schneiderlin. Trying to beat Stoke in the air is futile at the Britannia.

575~~~
I'm generally a Young out type but he works hard and performs adequately wherever he's thrown, so maybe he should stay for another year as cover.

576~~~
Was pretty decent. Nothing outstanding but at least he showed up.

577~~~
He's put in a good shift this first half.

578~~~
Few goal-saving tackles, been doing excellent.

579~~~
Great tackle on Azpi, had to get it spot on and he did.

580~~~
Like I've always said, terrible at crossing. Would be half decent if he could pick someone out.

581~~~
Can't believe that cross at the end. I mean it would be one thing if he just messed it up but he actually went for a low cross. Just sums him up really. He wasn't awful or anything but such an average player. I really can't understand that for a guy who only has crossing in his locker he can be so poor at it both in execution and in what he's trying to do.

582~~~
He's shit.

583~~~
This is why he barely gets assists, he's absolute wank at crossing. He can get himself in a decent position at least.

584~~~
What? He was very, very good today.

585~~~
He does everything right until the ball leaves his foot. He played well today both in attack and defence, but his final ball was dross.

586~~~
Surprised me with how well he did defensively. Did well to support our attacks on the overlap, but as per usual when it comes to actual end product from crossing positions, he is sorely lacking. I'm always amazed by the cries before a game begins for him to start out wide. Hardworking, honest player but low on quality.

587~~~
I honestly don't remember him being so shit at crossing when he was at Villa or even in his first season at Utd. There is only so many crossing it blindly can work, in the end you have to try to aim at your teammates.

588~~~
He gets into good positions quite often but he just blindly fires the ball and the chance goes begging, it's becoming Valencia-esque. So yeah, typical Young performance, lots of energy, got into some good positions but no money shot.

589~~~
He's a bang average player with absolutely no end product. He's shit.

590~~~
Thought he did very well - that tackle on azpilicueta was excellent. Willing to take on players, which is great. 

That that cross at the end was horrible though.

591~~~
He was good defensively but in this system he needs to offer more in attack, some terrible deliveries today.

592~~~
Very good defensively and has a positive attitude going forward but he thinks he is better than he is. This isn't a bad thing at times because it gives him confidence but a lot of the time he simply can't beat a man with his one dimensional dummies. I can't fault his attitude as I've said because it's good to see in this current side.

593~~~
People slating him for today's performance are mad. Had a very good game bar a few crosses.

594~~~
Close to being our MOTM. Defensively really good. Did well to support our attacks but his final ball wasnt great. Still believe he would be doing better from the left wing rather than RB though (or LB and put Darmian RB where hes played most of the early season for us, and where he will go once Shaw is back).

595~~~
Only his crossing gets really criticized which is more than fair.

596~~~
To be fair, it's pretty hard to land a cross after a slow build up that gives the defence time to get 10 men in the box.

597~~~
You're right, it's just a matter of increasing percentages is all. Better aimed crosses cannot be worse than the blind ones.

598~~~
Absolutely.

599~~~
His final ball was not good yesterday but I feel he needs some credit for the way he takes care of that whole right side all by himself. Even if we had a right winger who wasn't very good it would still be a huge help for Young just having another man om that wing helping him out when defending, giving him some passing options and just creating a bit of space with some movement.

600~~~
Smashing it today.

601~~~
Looks our best player today

602~~~
He's one of our most dependable players and gets way too much stick on here. Nice to see him closer to the goal, it's incomprehensible why he's only been a full-back this season having been our best outfield player playing as a LW from February onwards last season.

603~~~
Brilliant

604~~~
having a great game today

605~~~
Who's that right winger terrorising Swansea?

606~~~
Should obviously be playing RW/LW as first choice. Unlucky to lose his place to Memphis at the start of the season.

607~~~
I've no idea what position he's supposed to be playing but he's been brilliant

608~~~
Playing brilliant, hit by injury, story of the season

609~~~
He was very good. Hope his injury isn't too serious.

610~~~
Martial beating Young to MOTM by double is an outrage! I know we all love Martial and assisting the winner probably puts him to the forefront of most people's memory, but Young was clearly the MOTM today.

611~~~
Great to have another outlet on the right wing, just our luck for him to get injured.

612~~~
Very good game by him. If he wasn't calling for fouls so easily at times and didn't sometimes take forever to throw the ball in, I would have no problems with him.

613~~~
MOTM slightly ahead of Martial

614~~~
Very good performance, a constant threat down the right and his crossing was better than usual, hopefully it was just cramping that saw him come off.

615~~~
Martial had a goal and an assist. He gets it because without him, we wouldn't have scored a goal today. The reason we won the match was him, not Young, who played really well, but wasn't the decisive factor.

616~~~
It's no coincidence that two of our best players are people who can beat players.

617~~~
Imagine if we had a proper fast wide attacker and him on the same side. 

MOTM for sure.

618~~~
I agree. Young played well throughout the match (his injury slowed him down for five minutes before being subbed) where as Martial was poor in the 1st half before making up for it in the 2nd. 

For a player (Young) often bemoaned for his crossing he delivered a series of dangerous ones today.
Hope the injury is not too serious as he brought a dimension/threat to our game today that we rarely see.

619~~~
His crosses were much better. I don't know if it's because Rooney and Martial were more mobile inside the box or his aim was better.

620~~~
Give credit to the player, he gave it his all, some of the crosses we just asking to be placed in the back of the net. Hope that the knock isn't too serious.

621~~~
Ok so admittedly I went a little over the top - Martial deserves it on paper, but Young played better. He could have had 3 or 4 assists if Rooney was in finishing form and our attacking players go in the box for the great balls he kept swinging in.

622~~~
Just play him on the wing, like last season, and let Darmian get settled at RB. That would be our most potent attack at the moment (ie. Martial - Rooney - Young, with either Mata/Herrera behind, and Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin behind that.) Young is by no means the long-term solution, but he's a very good option for now.

623~~~
He just didn't give up in the first half as one of our few players. Really good today hopefully he keeps that kind of form, as he is usually too inconsistent

624~~~
He plays with real courage and intent. It's a shame that supposedly more talented players don't show the same willingness for the team.

625~~~
Why is he banned from playing as a winger? He completely owned the right side on his own.

Mata should be dropped and we should play Young on the RW. But I guess we don't have enough fit defenders to do that.

626~~~
He was playing as a winger. In possession United basically played 3-6-1. Even when Swansea had a throw-in in the final third on the opposite side he was high up the pitch. He definitely wasn't playing as a full back today. The tactics were why he had so much space. Herrera and Mata were constantly moving which always resulted in Young having a landing strip on the right.

Good game from him today.

627~~~
Think that was his best display of crossing he's had since he played for us. If only we could cross dangerously with regularity like that, it would be great. 

As usual though he worked his socks off today, I hope he was just being rested when he came off.

628~~~
Shame he went off, our best player today

629~~~
Puts in some good crosses, but it defo helped we had more than one in the box at times when he put the crosses in. I would like to see him as part of our front three again (on the right, with martial left, and striker (well rooney)). 

Would be fun to see. Hope his injury isnt serious and he plays next game.

630~~~
Love his positivity. 

Certainly doesn't seem to want to get bogged down in the possession game. 

Picks the ball up, runs at people and puts in crosses. Today the crosses were of very high quality. I'm at a loss why he can't produce like that more consistently. Better movement today perhaps?

631~~~
Hoping the injury isn't more than a niggle 

Fantastic today and he and Martial gave them nightmares

632~~~
Today he provided the kind of threat that he was bought for. I was always a big fan of Young at Watford and Villa and remember being really pleased when we signed him. After a promising, if not ground breaking first season, he went pretty woeful for a long time and I, like many others on here, couldn't see a way back for him at United. 

So I'm really pleased to see his resurgence as a hard working and dangerous player. His turnaround is one of the few bright influences of LVG's tenure. Hopefully he can maintain it

633~~~
If he could cross consistently, actually pick men out more instead of just hitting into areas, he'd be a very good player as he gets into good positions frequently. He did well today, hopefully can contribute decisive moments more often.

634~~~
Went from being a squad player at best to our biggest threat attacking in wide positions. As much as I'd like to say well done Ash I think a massive part is how much our quality or lack of it from our other wide players. I mean 4-5 years of Valencia mark II and Young then Mata and Depay is just abysmal!

635~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> I have to confess that really pisses me off as well. He takes so long, pointing with his eyes to teammates how and when and where he is about to throw the ball in from a throw in, makes it so comples like he is plotting a scheme to take over the world. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

636~~~
I criticised him after the Chelsea game, but he was very impressive, today. Think he realised the benefits of crossing to the man, as opposed to the area.

637~~~

638~~~
Good, sounds like his injury isn't serious then.

639~~~
Absolutely awesome. Love the lad.

640~~~
Martial - Herrera - Young

Mata & Depay should be dropped.

641~~~
Yeah he was- today. But this season he barely played on the wing, what I find totally unfair and simply stupid from van Gaal, especially considering how poor Memphis has been.

642~~~
He had a great game but too often he has 3 poor games after a great one. Hope he shows some consistency

643~~~
Credit where it's due. The guy has heart and gives everything for the shirt. He could easily have wilted when everyone was against him but he's come through it and won a lot of people over. He's never found wanting for effort. Brilliant game today.

644~~~
LVG deserves credit for creating that role for him.  Allowed Mata to wander inside so creating space for Young to attack.

One of my fav players in this depressing season.

645~~~
one of the best games for us, was playing alone on that wing

646~~~
Excellent performance. I don't think his crossing has ever been too bad, it's how static our movement is which makes it looks much worse.

There was movement in the box today and lo and behold, his crosses were finding the target.

647~~~
Fantastic performance. I have said for years, put him on the right as an old school winger. Yes on the left he can cut in and put in a dangerous cross but having a right footed winger on the right gives us so much more go forward.

Pleasing to see him turn his form around from a few years ago.

648~~~
It's not that unfair. He likes to play with inside forwards now and Young hasn't exactly done much this season in the final third. His crossing has generally hasn't been very good this season.

649~~~
Absolutely, the spirit of him is magnificent. Bar the one bad season with Moyes he's been consistently good in our best performances.

650~~~
Played very well, love the fact that he actually looks like he cares on the pitch too. Should never have lost his spot to Depay at the start of the season. Was pathetic management by LvG.

651~~~
How many times did he beat a man and carry the ball into the box today? We've missed that sort of thing on the right side.

652~~~
Completely agree.  I've always felt he was wasted on the left.  Ashley had a powerful shot at one time but that's gone from his game now.

653~~~
Better winger than ADM last year.

Much better than Depay this year. Deserves to start for us ahead of both. Credit to him for turning it around.

654~~~
Yep credit to Young, put in a great performance

655~~~
Great second half. Well done, Young.

656~~~
Young is a better left winger / inside forward than Memphis atm.

657~~~
Hmmmm <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2014/2015/ángel_di_maría/126/126/1846/0/p|premier_league/2014/2015/ashley_young/165/126/81/0/p#goals_scored/assists/chances_created/key_passes/attack_score/total_forward_passes#90" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/comparison-m...y_passes/attack_score/total_forward_passes#90</a>

658~~~
The crosses he was putting into the box were superb, the best I've seen in a while from a United player.

659~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

This silly argument again.

You must think that Rooney is our best attacker then this season seeing as he has the most goals.

As one speaker once put it, statistics are like mini skirts, they dont show everything.

Your stats dont account for the fact
- Young spent a significant part of the season in defensive positions (both LWB and LB) and was brought on to LW only once Van Gaal realized how poor Di Maria was playing and benched.

- That Di Maria's stats are heavily lumped towards the earlier part of the season, while Young stood out to be counted in the run in under pressure, permantly benching ADM in the process

- that Young's addition added more to the team, allowing it to perform better than the sum of its parts, especially with the triangle formation with Blind and Fellaini. Whereas Di Maria made us worse, by hardly contributing when it mattered, and rather became an outlet for the opposition to regain position

This requires a bit of common sense too.Not just throwing meaningless stats without context.

660~~~
Surely people are starting to realise his value. An essential squad player at his best. That moment where he slid the ball past the jumping fullback was vintage Ashley, reminded me of his Villa days.

661~~~
Hope he's back. At least he has a go.

662~~~
Seems he wasn't out of the red zone, just couldn't get into the game.

663~~~
I like Young as a wing-back. Got absolutely done by Sissoko though.

664~~~
He done nothing of note tonight.

665~~~
he started the game really well. His crosses are dangerous from that right hand side and he does have to check back like he does when he's on the left. That said, he's not a fullback. He can do an admirable imitation at times but he's just not a fullback. That's not his fault it's just LVG thinking he's hot shit by playing everyone in the wrong area of the pitch.

666~~~
Is he Scwheinsteigered now that he's played as a RB for like 6 games in a row? Would be interesting if he became top 3 in the world in that position.

667~~~
He didn't play in the FA cup and I don't know why you're even considering him becoming a top RB.

668~~~
Big blow that he has gone off. He was looking solid

669~~~
He was doing fine and then we get another fecking injury. <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

670~~~
I do like him but thought we looked far more balanced after he got injured.

Slight blessing in disguise.

671~~~
Out for "A long time" as he requires surgery on a groin injury.

672~~~
Feck. I hope we're still looking for another leftback.

673~~~
This dodgy post has only gone and jinxed him

674~~~
Dammit, Young was not only a surprisingly competent defender he was one of the few people offering some pace in our attacks.  On one hand this could mean Januzaj has a better chance of getting some game time, but still this is a bit gutting.

675~~~
It's a shame for him and us, he's developed in to quite a reliable player. Valencia must be nearing a return by now though?

676~~~
We seriously can't get any luck can we. Young has done a great job of filling in the gaps, and we are going to badly miss his energy and enthusiasm. This put's huge pressure on Varela and CBJ for the rest of the season.

677~~~
Big loss. One of the few players that actually has a go.

Our lack of pace and attacking fullback options look awful now.

678~~~
Just when I thought Adnan coming in would give us more optioms, Young gets injured. No surprise though, he had been playing like a mad man for a while now and I'm surprised LvG hadn't shut him down for a few games citing him being in the red zone.

679~~~
Probably........It just gets worse doesn't it?

680~~~
Never thought I'd be saying this about Ashley Young but, I'm gutted. Big loss.

681~~~
what the hell is it with us and defenders.
Even players who aren't proper defenders who go back there seem to get injured for ages.

We're squeezing by on Darmian-Blind-Smalling-BJ at the moment, with just Varela as backup?!

I presume Jonesy is close, but the rest seem miles off.

682~~~
I don't think now is the time to look for scapegoats. We are Manchester United and we will never die <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

683~~~
Don't forget Carrick could do a job in the middle. A potential back four could be Valencia - Carrick - Smalling - Blind

And we could even optimize by going down to a back 3 which would leave us with 3 back-ups. So we're not really in trouble just yet.

In case of serious problems we could even add a guy like Rooney on the wings. He's done a great job in Europe like when we were playing Barcelona he practically played as a fullback all game with Ronaldo as the striker up top. A real long shot could be adding Giggs as a fullback. If he's still taking care of himself he could add a little bit of quality to the team. Always though he had amazing sliding tackles. So potential nightmare scenario 3 in the back line-up would be: Rooney - Carrick - Giggs

684~~~
riiiighhttt <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

685~~~
Never thought I'd say this, but I miss this guy.

686~~~
Any idea when he's supposed to be back? Would be useful to have him out on the left/right with Martial up top, to get some consistent width and work rate and pace out wide

687~~~
The left spot is filled and he shouldn't be playing there. I'd have Depay or Martial (if Rashford is playing which he should) ahead of him. The right spot is up for grabs but Young is just so poor on the right. He can't do his favorite move which is to stop the ball, cut back and put a high ball to the far post.

688~~~
He looked very good against Stoke, Swansea and Chelsea on the right side I thought. He probably just need to adapt in that position since he's been playing most of his games last season on the left and when he had the hang on it he got injured because LVG decided to play him as a right back. I heard his injury will keep him until end of season hopefully not I really can't wait to see him back, he offers more than Lingard or Depay or even Rashford as a right winger.

689~~~
His Swansea game was one of his better games but he wasn't good against Chelsea or Stoke and he played as right back in all of them. He's been a left winger all his life. He doesn't offer us more than Lingard. Lingard has already scored half of Young's career total with us. If you look at the games Young has played in this season they weren't any better. Young or Lingard, it doesn't matter all that much.

690~~~
It wasn't just Swansea game, I thought he looked very good against Stoke and Chelsea. The only one who offer something when going forward against Stoke and even against Chelsea he was even better. I'm sure if he was given more chance to play as a winger instead of full back this season he would looked much better and effective than Lingard. I guess it's probably just me but I feel that Young is always offer something dangerous for the opposition team while Lingard did nothing effective when going forward.

691~~~
Young looks like he offers something but in all honesty he doesn't. He pretty much does the same thing in the final third and it's usually a high ball to the far post which is easy to clear. It's why everyone was on his back until last season when everyone around him came down to his level. He's a squad player that's nice to have when there are injuries because he can cover a whole range of positions.

692~~~
He's better than Lingard on the right.

693~~~
We've missed Young on the wing and the same for Valencia. We would be a lot more threatening if we had Young on the left and Valencia on the right, feeding Martial.

694~~~
Said absolutely nobody ever. You have to be kidding me... have you forgotten how gash those two were whenever they played together on the wing? Valencia in particular offers less than nothing. He is a collapsed star, a black hole, suckling all the life and creativity out of everyone around him. He's literally a scientific phenomenon of extraordinary uselessness. Young over the years has only been somewhat better.

695~~~
It's not ideal but have ya seen how we've been playing recently. Valencia has struggled but he can get us up the pitch. That's bullshit what you are saying about Young. He has been brilliant when he plays. He is able to beat a man and deliver some good crosses/cross shots.

696~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

yeah I agree. 

Valencia on the other hand has been dreadful going forward for a few years now. All he does when he attacks is smash the ball on opponents shins. Thats not an exagerration either. Hes OK defensively, but so is Darmian and he's crap too. Should be used as back up to Varela.

698~~~
Young could be useful. Valenica on the wings will be useless. He doesnt get the correct pass or make the correct cross nowadays. Would rather see him at RB, if he beats Varela and Darmian in training of course.

699~~~
I said before that Young is a player who gets most out of his averageness, he always give his all on the pitch.
The truth is i probably said in the past that the Club should sell him at some point.

Now i'm not so sure. He seems to be a great person to have in the dressing room, he is a joker and friend of all the lads.
Also, he plays any position without kicking up a fuss, a real team player.

Should that be enough to keep him here? In his case i'm beginning to think so.

700~~~
The thing for me is that the 2 positions he covers best are already covered with CBJ, Fosu-Mensah, Darmian and even Riley covering Valencia and Shaw. I personally hope we wont need to use him as a winger after the summer.

701~~~
Fans here are underestimating what Ashley Young capable on the pitch. He was the one who kicked ADM from starting eleven. The quality of his crossing is indeed not consistent enough and he will be 31 next season. But he has the skills consistently beat players and giving trouble to opposition full back, his touch and ball control are also very good. To be fair, currently he is still a better player than Memphis IMO. With his work rate and being versatility, he will still be very useful for our squad next season.

Haven't we learn from last summer? Selling so many our players isn't a good idea as it will change the whole atmosphere of the club. And from all the players we have why has to be Young? there are more players out there deserve to be sold. And also it's not like we have tons of winger who is better than Young. Martial is the only player who can play as a winger that we have who is currently better than Young and it's difficult to sign more than 1 quality wingers in the summer as there is not much option left.

702~~~
I'd say his crosses are as consistent as they get. Cutting in from the left he puts those back post curlers within inches of the same spot every single time.

703~~~
I think his crosses are not so wayward as they were in 2013-14. Earlier he never used to lookup and concentrate on the feet and the ball and make a snap cross regardless of whether there was anyone there at all. 
But in 2014-15, he started looking a bit up and went in some good form consistently. Though LvG tried his best to ruin it by playing him RW and RB in some matches here and there.

704~~~
I noticed a lot of the time no one is there in the box to actually take advantage of his crosses, so its usually for nothing, and people think he's terrible at it.

705~~~
He must have played more positions at United than any other player at this point, I guess one decent run out in the U21's was all loony needed to not put him in his natural role and move Martial to the striker position.

706~~~
He was absolutely awful today.

707~~~
Second to John O' Shea, who's somehow played every position on the pitch for us.

708~~~
What do you expect from a winger who's played full back all season being asked to play up front for the first time in his career? All this when he's just back from injury too. The manager is completely at fault there.

709~~~
Yeah, this is true.

710~~~
Nice to have him back. Stick him on the left or right, Martial up top and use random.org for the 3rd player.

711~~~
Just needs to go, doesn't offer us anything that one of the younger players can't do. He'll be 31 in a few months and I don't see him as a first team starter or someone who can really make a difference in a game.

712~~~
Weird subs. Young is clearly need more match fitness. 45 mins against this current Spurs is obviously going to be tough for him. And what makes it worse is why he played as a striker when he's a winger.

713~~~
What has been happening to him all season?

714~~~
LVG

715~~~
Returns from injury and comes on as striker. Then he doesn't get anything while Rojo costs us games at LB. 

Young is also better than Lingard. He's either still not fit or LVG is done with him

716~~~
Yeah... Ive never been a big fan of Young and think it would be best to see him go this summer but he's been treated terribly by LvG.. Not the first player to be treated that way, though.

717~~~
Still managing to steal a living on the basis of six good games in about four years.

Young is the perennial big club time-waster. He barely plays and won't kick up a fuss regarding game time. He'll just loiter around in the background, neither hindering or really contributing. It should tell you all you need to know.

718~~~
Christ that is vitriolic even by Caf standards.
Young has played wherever he has been asked to by LVG and given it his all. While there may be valid questions as to whether his best is good enough, his attitude and application has been exemplary in the last two seasons and for a stretch of last season he was the only one willing to take on the responsibility of having and trying to do something with the ball.

"He barely plays" because the manager makes those decisions. I'm sure if given the power, Young would put himself in the team every week.
Not kicking up fuss about game time is a bad trait? I thought that was commonly called professionalism. Maybe it would be preferable if he was mouthing off to the press and undermining the club and manager?
"He'll just loiter in the background..." what is this drivel even based on? Should he be on his soapbox leading press conferences, on the sidelines issuing tactical adjustments, starting e-petitions?

Young is one of the few players that has endured the LVG and come out of it looking better than they did before. His career was on the uppers yet he still put in a shift whenever asked and managed to displace our record signing on the merit of his performances. He has since played enthusiastically in both FB roles only to be rewarded with being frozen out of the team instead of getting game time in his more accustomed position. Knock his ability all day long but a character assassination is unjustifiable when he is one of the select few to display any redeemable character whatsoever.

719~~~
All you've done there is, essentially, praise him for being a good guy with an enthusiastic attitude. That's probably a fair assessment, but it would also be a fair assessment of you or I.  

Young is paid handsomely to sit on our bench. He isn't demonstrating any real loyalty or anything, he's just clinging on to the club by his fingernails for as long as he possibly can. In truth, I'm sick of having these players at the club and we need to be doing more to weed them out.

Young deserved praise for his little resurgence last season and he was awarded that. This season has just been an injury-hit return to normality.

720~~~
I probably wouldn't have responded had you written that first time, not much to take exception with as it doesn't infer he is some malignant presence at the club. He is not much different to a lot of our squad, a decent player, not good enough to take us where we all want to be, just going about his job as instructed whilst somewhat relying on past glory. Him being here is not his fault, him not being good enough is not even his fault as long as he is trying his best. No matter what someone decides to pay you, one can only perform to the level of ability one possess and Young has largely done that these last two seasons IMO.

I think my the main point I tried to convey is that there is ample scope to criticise Ashley Young as a player and his suitability for a club of this stature but that shouldn't extend to criticising him as a person.

721~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

What nonsense.

722~~~
Seems him and Jones have been frozen out from the matchday squad ala Rafael.

723~~~
He is off.

724~~~
When was his last game? Spurs away?

725~~~
Mourinho will like him, sadly.

726~~~
It's bizarre how LVG fast tracked him back in, deciding he was a good option as a striker against Spurs and now he's nowhere to be seen.

727~~~
I'm not Young's biggest fan, and I don't think he's the level of winger we need, but it's a bit odd how in a season where we've usually seen the injection of pace improve us, Young has been used to sparingly. Instead of always going for a slow right winger, I would have thought Young would have been a decent option every now and then.

728~~~
Times are bad when you miss the painfully average Ashley Young.

729~~~
This. We also (stupidly) gave him a new three year deal this season and now he cannot even make the squad when we are resting players...

I would hate to play under Van Gaal, you can go from being ignored to valued and back again so quickly.

730~~~
Well, he is not Neymar and VG had the pick of the "best young talent in Europe" to play left wing. Perfectly understandable.

731~~~
Well the thing is he's not even on the bench these days which is the treatment when you're really on LVG's bad book (ala Rafael,Jones or to some extent Pereira). Tbh I'm fine if we sell him but I just don't get why he's suddenly being ignored.

732~~~
He's a better option than Depay currently. 

I'd rather keep him and get rid of Depay in the summer, if I had a choice.

733~~~
He signed a new deal last year and is on pretty big wages. We'll struggle to get rid of him.

734~~~
I was being sarcastic, mate. 

And I agree with you. This has been evident for a while. I remember making posts about him being 'in the doghouse' back in November-December.

735~~~
Quite baffling why he was dropped. We should do better than him ideally but the guy almost always looks one of the our most threatening players.

736~~~
Remember when LVG brought him on as a no.9? Fun times.

737~~~
If we're getting rid of Memphis then we might as well go for someone better than Young.

738~~~
This. It's a bit sad that this is the case, but the reality is that Young has been (other than Martial) our most consistently dangerous wide player over the last two seasons. And all credit to him, he picked up his game significantly for that to be the case. Normally at fullback, but sometimes on the actual wing as well. As such, why he isn't even getting close to a look in right now is ridiculous.

739~~~
Jones doesn't deserve to be in the squad though, has stolen a living here for the last 12 months.

740~~~
Yeah that's why I posted this on Young's thread not Jones.Jones is 100% off in the summer unless the new manager thinks otherwise.

741~~~
I'd rather he started than Memphis. 

For the second year running , he is better than our shiny new toy.  

He also puts a great defensive shift so he could help the bumbling Rojo on the left side.

742~~~
It makes too much sense for him to play. Probably be Depay stinking up the place as always.

743~~~
He would actually probably do a better job at left back than anyone that has played there for us recently.

744~~~
Woah. Just realized Young is fit this whole time. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/> So basically LVG made mistake sub Young in as central forward then froze him out since the Tottenham game <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>? Were not included on the bench for Norwich trip while Rashford was rested. Mind boggling.

745~~~
Where he go?

746~~~
He has a slight knock.

747~~~
Bit unlucky to not get into an England squad short of decent wingers (and possibly fullbacks)? Or just not played enough?

748~~~
Not good enough. Lallana, Sterling etc are all better.

749~~~
Townsend isn't, in my opinion. 

I wouldn't blame Roy for that decision though. He has every right to pick the players he personally likes better or trusts more, as long as it's not at the expense of someone who definitely deserves to be there. Young doesn't, really.

750~~~
Forget Ibra we have Ashley! <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

751~~~
Townsend shouldn't even be there either.

752~~~
Even when Young was in a good spell of form Hodgson didn't fancy him. Strange one for me, he obviously hasn't played enough but then again neither has Wilshere, Young would at least ensure that you have cover in up to 4 positions.

753~~~
Probably been injured far too much this season. Has hardly played the last 4-5 months. Normally though I would bring him over most of the England wingers.

754~~~
Great to see him back. Good movement from him in the box. He was playing well before the injury. England was calling at the time.

755~~~
Good cameo from him at the end, unlucky not to have a second goal. Personally it looked on side to me.

756~~~
I wouldn't mind him playing instead of Lingard next game

757~~~
I'd start him in the final. Better quality and sharper movement than Lingard and Depay.

758~~~
He should have been playing much more during this run in. Laughable really. Either LB or an option on the wing. He's no world beater, but he still has the ability to skip past his man and get in a cross pretty much better than anyone in the squad bar Martial.

759~~~
Was he not injured?

760~~~
I had no idea he was fit.. not sure why he wasn't a bench option until today! Bournemouth had stopped trying - but two brilliant runs and finishes - his second was a bit unlucky as it looked onside to me.

761~~~
I think it was, from watching the replay. Probably more onside than his actual goal!

762~~~
I thought he's been fit for a while?

763~~~
Of the 3 positions he played today I thought he was best at LB.
