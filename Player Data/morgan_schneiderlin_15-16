Really fecking glad this guy has joined - more excited than the Schweini signing if I am honest.

14~~~
Great news welcome

18~~~
What a glorious day!

19~~~
Those 5 minutes later he showed up to Carrington meant he had to be announced on twitter 5 minutes later right? <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> fecking get in. Too much to handle

20~~~
Ah feck it.

21~~~
All these threads <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

22~~~
I knew he'd pick us over arsenal. We are too big to turn down. When you spend money and sign big players it creates a snowball effect imo. There's more to these signings than just the players role on the pitch.

23~~~
There are about 10 Morgan threads I think

24~~~
Great signing! Welcome!

25~~~
Just got cracking tickets for the opening day to watch him destroy Spurs

Great signing.

26~~~
Schneini!

27~~~
Our midfield is now superb

28~~~
He's soooo pretty. The season can't start soon enough.

29~~~
All threads merged...

If it weren't for Iwata today would be a truly outstandingly good day.

30~~~
This is mad.

31~~~
Amazing how quickly muppets react. Great signing.

32~~~
2 threads.

Bitter Cnut but my god am I happy!!!

36~~~
Well this has been a memorable few minutes.

Spelling Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger is wrecking my head already. Gonna get those wrong a lot.

37~~~
This is amazing!

3 signings in as many days. fecking hell I can't take anymore of this

38~~~
Beautiful<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

Very happy with this one. Him and Herrera should be the spine of our midfield for the foreseeable future.

We're not messing at all this summer. Get a CB and a young striker in Woody!!

Holy feck!! My excitement is off the charts!! What a signing!! Bienvenue United Morgan!! Twitter and media must be going crazy! What to follow and what to not!!

48~~~
This is a great signing, I can't believe some people still don't see how good he is.....or maybe opposition fans are just being bitter.

49~~~
I can't work. My god my god my god. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

50~~~
He is a fantastic signing, the most important one we could make this summer.

51~~~
This is such a fantastic signing. Exactly what we need along with Bastian.

Oh I cannot wait until the season starts <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

52~~~
Jesus. What a few days this has been.

<b>Morgan Schneiderlin</b> said: "I am delighted to be a Manchester United player. Once I learned that United were interested in signing me, it was a very easy decision to make. I have enjoyed seven very happy years with Southampton and it’s a club that will always be in my heart. But the chance to be part of this squad to help this great club be successful was too good to miss.

"I’m excited to be starting that journey on our trip to the USA. I know what Manchester United means to fans all over the world and I’m looking forward to experiencing that."

<b>Louis van Gaal</b> said: "Morgan is a very talented player with great energy and ability. His skills will complement the players that we already have and I am very pleased that we have been able to complete this deal before the tour to the United States. That training camp will be very important in our preparations for the new season and gives Morgan and the other players a chance to show our fans what they can achieve together."

61~~~
We have managed to fix a midfield problem that we've had for nearly a decade, in 48 hours.

Get the feck in!

62~~~
Well he actually hinted that offensively they don't need players (not interested in Sterling) but he wanted Schneiderlin. And this one:
"I obviously like Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger (stops for about 3-4 seconds) and Sterling" <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

63~~~
He also looks good in the shirt. can't stand the excitement<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

64~~~
I"ve been a fan for about two years. Really excited about this transfer.

65~~~
Delighted with this signing. Will bring energy and some physicality to our midfield which we've lacked in recent years.

66~~~
I'm glad that getting the pig herder didn't rule this one out. He'll do well for us I'm sure.

67~~~
I tapped out those letters furiously, it was the fecking | that defeated me though - what fecking alphabet does that come from?

68~~~
Good thing you got Bastian right <img alt=":angel:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie11" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Angel    :angel:"/>

69~~~
He's a bit of a sexy bastard isn't he?

70~~~
Incredible few days.

71~~~
What a signing! I keep checking the united website just in case another transfer slipped through the radar like Morgan yesterday!  Get in.

72~~~
The Schmidfield is complete.

73~~~
Delighted. Our midfield looking good for first time in a very very long time <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

74~~~
This is the one transfer I desperately wanted to happen.

75~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/U11f9e5.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/U11f9e5.jpg"/> 

Never thought I'd be seeing that <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

76~~~
Today is Schneidsteiger day. Or Schweinschneider. Or Schweinerlin.

What a window.

77~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

78~~~
He's very handsome, isn't he?

79~~~
Morgan fecking Schneiderlin and Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger announced 5 minutes apart from each other.

Surely the other teams are really concerned now. What a day!

80~~~
Midfielders everywhere!

81~~~
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!

82~~~
What a sexy, sexy man!

83~~~
He looks tal, but he's not. Fascinating.

84~~~
I've wanted this guy since November 2013. Finally! <3

85~~~
Have to say, Van gaal's signing (apart from Di Maria) haven't hurt the looks department of our squad at all...

86~~~
Our team is so handsome. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

87~~~
Di Maria doesn't fit the profile of a Manchester United signing due to his face.

88~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> So harsh, so true

89~~~
The day of King SchWoody.

90~~~
Overall squad good looking points rise

91~~~
Signing of the summer for me.

92~~~
Excellent news - his signature alone makes me much more optimistic for the season ahead. We look to be solving some long-standing problems in this transfer window.

93~~~
Our squad is attractive as feck... De Gea, Blind, Shaw, Januzaj, Mata ( <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> ), Schneiderlin ... and you've got Carrick and Schweinsteiger working it in the over 30's category.

Oh and Jones of course...

94~~~
Amazing couple of days. We now have more midfielders than you could throw a stick at.

I also think we're trying to expand our fanbase even further amongst the women of the world because our team is now uncomfortably good looking for the most part.

95~~~
Welcome Schneider-man.

96~~~
Delighted with these past few days. Really wanted Morgan especially, glad we got him!

97~~~
I do wonder what becomes of Blind in particular now. Will he just be a backup to Shaw?

98~~~
Being back-up to Shaw is like being first choice to be fair.

99~~~
Great video from Southampton. That golf skill... <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

100~~~
He can play three positions so I'm sure he'll get plenty of games. I doubt Shaw will start every week even if fit to be honest so we don't burn him out.

101~~~
Shaw won't play over 45 games in a season, same goes for other players.

102~~~

103~~~
Poor Darmian is left out again <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

104~~~
Oh my! Never knew there were so many bitter Arsenal fans who are just as bitter as some Liverpool fans.

105~~~
Lovely video, nice to see them being classy about his departure.

106~~~
I'm going to just type Morgan and Basti....too long these names.

107~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Get in! Midfield finally sorted out.

108~~~
He's one of the best midfielders in the league. So glad he's signed for us!

109~~~
He's got that default Pro Evo face.

110~~~
Oh my gooody god. Now this is what I've been waiting for <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

I'm certainly no homophobe but the responses in this thread are incredibly gay <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

112~~~
I've loved him ever since FIFA 11 when I managed Soton on career mode.

113~~~
He looks too much like Sha Labeouf... it unsettles me.

Homophobe!

Who's your most attractive United player? aye?

114~~~
Transfer season turns us all into a pack of horny women.

115~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Brilliant.

116~~~
Welcome to Manchester United Morgan.

117~~~
This is the midfield signing i wanted. Great to have him at the club.

118~~~
All playing in harmony under one philoschophy

119~~~
Now we just need Sneijder and Schteve Mclaren.

120~~~
Schweinsteiger is ugly as feck, to be fair.

121~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> That's awful

122~~~
Why? If he looked like Jimmy Saville it would be unsettling <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

123~~~
Probably an he can also play centre back as well. I thought he looked alright in his appearances there last season. He should still get a fair number of games if we manage to have a few deep cup runs and keep our schedule busy.

124~~~
This is so true <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

125~~~
Morgan is a bit of a shit name tbf,

Think I'll take the extra effort of typing out Schneiderlin each time.

126~~~
As great as a signing schweinsteiger is, Morgan is the 1 for the long term I'm happiest about. He could be our midfield general for years to come!

127~~~
It's a feckin' great name! More people should be called Morgan... It's up there with Gordon, or Mortimer

128~~~
From SaintsWeb <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>:

Glaston must post in that forum. No other explanation possible.

You can't have a sexy first xi without Carrick.Stick him in for Evans.

152~~~
Welcome Captain Morgan!  Delighted he has joined us.  Great signing in my opinion.

153~~~
Buzzing is an understatement. 

Daley blind has got a rival for most attractive player.

154~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Amazing!

155~~~
Morgan is our best signing this summer. He was so good for Southampton last season!

156~~~
Can't believe I forgot about our well-aged Geordie hunk!

157~~~
Not just last season, he's been great since they got promoted. Been wanting this signing to happen since mid-2013.

158~~~
Wow I had no idea he's been there so long.

159~~~
Still hasn't updated his bio. Sell him.

160~~~
Championship to Champions League. The trait I admire most about him is the harder the level of football got the harder he worked and the more he improved and I hope that continues.

161~~~
Looks like this was a done dealio all along and Arse only walked out as soon as we came into the picture

162~~~
League One, I believe

163~~~
I would have been so so gutted if Schneiderlin went to Arsenal, I was dreading it for ages until the rumours started propping up about United being interested. He not only strengthens us but it also stops a potential title rival strengthening too.

164~~~
More like League One to Champions League.

165~~~
Even better.

166~~~
What is his rating on Fifa? <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/><img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

169~~~
80

170~~~
I has never thought that Id ever say it again but jeez we've got a magnificent CM now

171~~~
I actually bought him on my FIFA career mode... then I sold him. I'm a bad person.

172~~~

173~~~
Interview at 3:30 on MUTV.

174~~~
Don't he have a plane to catch?

175~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/tpmSRNV.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/tpmSRNV.png"/>

There's a good lad. Could be #22 for United as well as it's likely Nick Powell will leave...

176~~~
It wont be live.

177~~~
Didn't realize he was such a good passer, looks to be as good as Carrick.

178~~~
Where's that medical for you, medical for everyone image of van Gaal from last year? Very apt again.

179~~~
Damn, I'm so jealous right now.

180~~~
Some Spurs fan on twitter having a meltdown <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

181~~~
Think he will be our best signing. Absolutely delighted we have him. Also, from a straight man, he is very handsome <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

182~~~
Viva Schneiderlin, Viva Schneiderlin
Morgan Schneiderlin

Is a great feeling isn't it? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

185~~~
Southampton did him a favour by refusing to sell him to Spurs last summer. Reckon he's pretty chuffed with that as well.

186~~~
Today's the day lads. 

Trust me.  I can feel it.

187~~~
So fecking happy about this. It is the one signing Ive wanted for the last year!

188~~~
You suck the fun out of everything.

189~~~
Nah, I think this one's dead in the water. Probably just using us to get a new contract

190~~~
Nah, this ones over.

LVG has chosen Bastian.

<img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

191~~~
Nah, we'll have our pants pulled down.

192~~~
Any MUTV live streams to see the exclusive interviews?

193~~~
Feels fantastic to finally have a ball winner in midfield again.

194~~~

195~~~
Lost for words, really. I guess whoever has our title can consider themselves served!!!!!!! 
....................and feck Liverpool.

196~~~
It sort of vindicated years of complaining at redcafe about this issue.

197~~~
You can feel vindicated if/when this magnificent central midfield delivers the same level of sustained success we enjoyed under Fergie.

198~~~
That's kind of redundant isn't it? Most of SAF's success came with a CM as good if not better than we have now. The Robson-Ince duo, the Ince-Keane partnership, the Keane-Scholes partnership and the Carrick-Scholes partnership. I think the issues started few years ago when it was becoming evident that Scholes was growing old, Hargreaves was a crock and Ando and Cleverley were shit. Surely SAF kept winning at least in the EPL level. However for one reason or another we kept on tackling the sympthoms (ex buying RVP) rather then finding the cure

199~~~
It has to be said, the collective "Redcafe" has been wrong about a lot of players we signed and a lot we apparently should have signed over the years. 

Let's hope this year is more Herrera than Kagawa.

200~~~
I'm sure Schneiderlin will be a great signing for us. Almost has a Carrick feel about it, when we know he's proven in the prem, not a household name but will slot right in and improve us.

201~~~
I'm sure I remember you saying we badly needed new CMs when we had the Carrick-Scholes partnership?

202~~~
I started to become concerned when Scholes hit the 33-34 years of age. Usually clubs tend to start to bring replacements at that age (as we're currently doing with Carrick). At that point I was confident that the likes of Cleverley, Ando and Fletcher would never reach the standards needed to replace Scholes adequately. Prior to that I was worried about our inability to replace Roy Keane. In matter of fact I was relieved that we got Carrick as in my opinion Keane overstayed by for 2 seasons

TBF I was surprised by SAF ability to make due with the situation at hand. Moving Giggs to CM was a masterstroke and his ability to rotate the players and give them adequate rest prolonged the players careers for at least 3 years. However as Paul Scholes once said, there's something terribly wrong at a club when your best two midfielders happen to be at the wrong end of their 30s.

Classy looking though.

238~~~
It's ok. There are better things to have a go at RAWK with like they got Ings/Milner and we got Schweinsteiger/Schneiderlin.

239~~~
I'm happy with the signing and believe he'll be a good player for us for many years.

As a female Blind just slightly edges it for me, nevertheless he is quite sexy! But it's mainly about the football of course. Definitely more about the football. No....sod it we have the best looking team in the prem currently! <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

243~~~
Seriously happy about all the signings we've made this window, but this is the one I really wanted to happen. Even when we got Depay and Darmian I was (little) 'Yay', then came Schweinstieger and it was 'Yay?', but now I'm full on 'YAY!'. Get, as they say, in. Son.

244~~~
For me he is a direct Carrick replacement and is not fully developed yet imagine when he is. Ever since Southampton was promoted I've been watching this guy, very talented and more to come from him!

245~~~
Really pleased to get this deal done. We've needed a player with his qualities at the club for a number of years and we automatically look a better side with him in the team. He's a talented player who I'm backing to be a big hit at the club in the coming years.

246~~~
Keep em coming man! Hilarious

248~~~
I still can't believe that the one signing I've wanted above all else, for the last 6 months or so, despite not even being linked with him at the time, and we've only gone and bloody signed him. Feels bloody brilliant.

249~~~
Carrick, Herrera, Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger.... top quality and depth. It really is great

250~~~
What an awesome midfield... We definitely ballin' this year!  Great job Ed keep it going now!

251~~~
On paper, its the best midfield in the league. And I didn't think I'd ever being saying that again!

Just really hope it all clicks.

Interview with both new signings in HD

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-c6xm5v5Xzg?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

253~~~
So far, out of all of signings, this one probably pleases me the most, to be honest, which is probably a bit strange since we've signed Schweinsteiger. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>  I just think we've been missing this type of player for years now.

254~~~
Agreed, out of all our signings thus far this is the player we needed the most.
Since Keane left we haven't gotten a proper CDM in and now we finally have one.

Schneiderlin would enable Bastian, Herrera, Mata and the rest of the midfielders to play to their potential. The whole side will be benefit greatly from his presence.
All that is needed is a CB and we will challenge for the league title.

255~~~
Since 2005 imho

256~~~
I'm not exactly excited to be signing a player who has spent most of his career in the lower divisions.

257~~~
Did you not see how he played against us last season ?

258~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

???

261~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Amazing that people are falling for it.

262~~~
Already a quality player with plenty of development potential, plus the opportunity to play alongside, train with and learn from Carrick and Schweinsteiger. 

Great signing! Exactly the sort of player we've needed.

263~~~
He's basically got the two best role-models he could hope for, one for each side of his game. Because his style of play falls almost exactly between the two.

264~~~
I think out of all our signings so far i'm more excited about Schneiderlin

265~~~
he's the best United signing post Fergie era, we will basically win every midfield battle against anyone in the league with Herrera also brilliant in terms of tackles/interceptions. This is fan fecking tastick

266~~~
fecking ace. can't believe we have a midfield

267~~~
I could watch this all day.

268~~~
This is a great video to get your muppet juices flowing. Shows the range of skills he has, both defensively and going forward. He might not have the Carrick range of passing, but he's still a very crisp and good passer (89% pass success rate last season) and he's also quite a capable dribbler. 

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1EgNLzbdya8?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

Schweini talking about philosophy, he's a product of LVG alright <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

270~~~
It's all coming together nicely!

271~~~
The key thing he said in that interview for me was he knows he's '<i>not the finished product</i>' and that he can learn more. Love that attitude. Just work hard Morgan and listen to your coaches. Welcome to Manchester United!!!
I can't help it - so happy with our new signings<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

272~~~
Really happy with our signings. I thought we had signed our last player ever when we signed Mata for all that cash. When we broke the bank for Di Maria I was starting to think Messi was also coming. 

Schweinsteiger is a slap in the face for the germans. To me that was the most ungettable player we've ever signed. Schneiderlin is like having an extra woman in bed. Finally it's once again possible to say we're the biggest club in the world.

273~~~
Yes! Yes! Yes! He's the one I have been waiting for. He'll be the constant in our midfield in years to come. So kick ass it hurts.

274~~~
Echo this 100%

275~~~
So much pride in our midfield for the first time in ages.

276~~~
Has LvG made any comments about him yet?

277~~~
Just watched some YouTube videos. He is the ball winner and passer we have been missing. 

IMO our most important signing to date.

278~~~
Van Gaal on Schneiderlin: "He's a very talented player with great energy & ability. His skills will complement our players."

279~~~

280~~~
I would say RVP and Di Maria seemed more ungettable but may be because of Schweinsteigers age. Still "one of the most" shocking transfers I can remember

Signing him and Schneiderlin is excellent though

281~~~

This just looks so right <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

289~~~
I'm telling you guys, he will be our best midfield signing since Carrick.

290~~~
Hope he gets #15 or #6 if Evans leaves.

291~~~
Can't believe he's not even 6 feet, he looks so long <img alt=":nervous:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/nervous.gif" title="Nervous    :nervous:"/>

292~~~
22 i think as that's his number in the national team.

293~~~
It's the extra 6 inches from the gelled up hair

294~~~
Finally someone apart from Carrick that can play those beautiful long cross field passes!!! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

295~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5VZ_Skk63U?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

He makes tackling and interceptions look so easy! The highlight reminds of his game at Stamford Bridge. He was so good

296~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

To think just a month or so ago I just accepted that he was going to Arsenal, saddened by the fact that United missed out on a player that would seriously improve us.

297~~~
I'd pretty much accepted he was going to Arsenal for the last 6 months or so. All the rumours pointed that way, and we weren't even linked in the slightest (iirc)

Makes it all the sweeter that we got him <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

298~~~
I can't believe we have Bastian, Schneiderlin and Herrera in CM

299~~~
you have TWO more guys, mind

300~~~
He reminds me a lot of Darren Fletcher.

301~~~
Glad he has the likes of Bastian/Carrick behind him, will be influential for him.

302~~~
Fletcher was box to box. Their styles are certainly very different.

303~~~
Love that moment in 1:17 into the video where he chases down the City players and making that tackle. Not had anyone do that since Fletcher before his illness.

304~~~
All that tenacity and energy <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

305~~~
The people managing the Southampton FC Twitter account are a funny bunch.



Classy from the Saints, right? Yes, of course, but also a slight dig as well following this from Schneiderlin 12 months ago after he was denied a move to Spurs...



All worked out for the best, eh Mo? And as for Saints, all this after taking the mick out of <a class="internalLink" href="http://www.redcafe.net/posts/17773362/">Liverpool and Rodgers</a> the day before.

306~~~
I think Schneiderlin is box to box as well. My understanding is that he isn't a pure DM, deep lying playmaker at all. A defensive minded box to box is how I'd describe him

307~~~
Is Schneiderlin a 2-footed player? I saw him make passes with both his left and right.

308~~~
Our signings apart from Di Maria, have all rather been good looking once Fergie left.

309~~~
That's not saying much.

310~~~
If he turns out to be as influential as Carrick has been, I'd be more than pleased.

311~~~
Ok another footballer's height listed wrongly in profiles. Watching the press conference and him standing next to 6 foot Schweini and 6'1 (1.86) LvG, he is about as tall as LvG..

312~~~
I genuinely don't think I have ever been as happy, excited and totally satisfied with a signing as I am with Schneiderlin

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Compare this to the MF options we had when LVG Joined. 

It's just the perfect example of how much of a master Fergie was. A Club owner's dream. Winning Championships with dross.

314~~~
Needs to bulk up

315~~~
I am not excited I cant believe it yet. Somehow I still believe that by the time we start the season campaign these players will vanish and we will end up with Ando, Cleverley and Fletcher again

316~~~
Dunno if it's a sly dig, it's a nice video in any case. He looks so young at the beginning of it! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

317~~~

318~~~
Surely he's got to be at least 6 foot? He looks tall as feck.

319~~~
From this video hes a combo of Carrick and young Keano.

320~~~
His hair makes him look taller. <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>

I really like midfielders similar to Schneiderlin being mixture of technique, quickness and strength. I think he will be key during the course of the season. It is very interesting to see who plays the number 6 position between Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger. Schweinsteiger has a great range of passing but so does Schneiderlin although not to the extent of Schweinsteiger. If we do play a 3 man midfield the box to box role will be handed to either one of them and most likely Herrera has a free run on the 3rd midfield spot, the playmaker unless LVG decides to deploy Mata through the middle.

321~~~
He reminds of Jamie Dornan ...

322~~~
That is what I thought as well, he is terrific in the tackle and has a great range of passing...with him and someone like Otamendi our side will finally have a strong spine again....its been a while since I could say that.

323~~~

So glad we got him too. I was worrying that Louis might think Schweinsteiger would be enough but with Schneiderlin, Blind, Carrick and Bastian we have a very solid and deep midfield. Schneiderlin is a very, very good player!

325~~~
big 50 shades of grey fan i see...

326~~~
So you're not a Spurs fan?

327~~~
This is the kind of signing that really does take a team in the moment we are in forward - the moment we are in being a team who is slowly rebuilding after such a massive change from losing Sir Alex. Last Summer's signings were all good as they at least showed intent, this year we have bought players that will improve us immensely...players that will take us from top 4 finishers to title winners, if not this year definitely in the coming years.

328~~~
Easily the best compilation I've seen of Morgan so far. Its 10 minutes long, but certainly worth a watch. Shows how much he has to his game, and what he'll bring to the team. Also, for anyone that thinks he can't pass or is slow, have a watch. The clips where he keeps pace, and tackles, Adebayor and Welbeck are fantastic <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

329~~~
I'm still curious to how good he is in a box-to-box role attacking wise besides Herrera and infront of Schweini, i'm not sure that would be the optimal setup.

330~~~
He has such a nice touch and it's a joy to watch him play.

331~~~
I think he's going to have the most immediate impact out of our new signings.

332~~~
Clearly

333~~~
poor you Lennon...<img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/> after repeating a thousand times, it has become the truth

334~~~
Really excited to see him and Ander in midfield together, been a while since we've had grit, mobility, and tidy technique through the centre.

335~~~
the last claim to level at him

336~~~
Took him 5 mins to score.

Not bad, Morgan!

337~~~
He's fantastic, just like Herrera debut last year.

338~~~
Morgasm

339~~~
Looking quality.

340~~~
I'm in love.

341~~~
What a signing.

342~~~
Holy shit.

343~~~
Absolutely love the handsome bastard <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/><img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

344~~~
Morgan fecking Schneiderlin.

345~~~
Solid debut coupled with a pretty fantastic header.

346~~~
I still can't believe we've signed him. Love him so much.

347~~~
Great debut for him, could prove to be a very good signing.

348~~~
His range of passing is impressive. Ran the show pretty much on his own in midfield.

349~~~
Class... Our midfield is going to be brilliant. Pleasantly surprised by his range of passing as well, never focused much on that aspect of his game.

350~~~
As expected, looking quality in the middle of the park. Bossing things. 

Great at getting in those tackles. Really combative player.

351~~~
Told you he was the man <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

352~~~
Hard to believe you could get a player like this for 25 mil now a days. Absolute class.

353~~~
He's brilliant.

354~~~
His passing is immense. 

He hasn't shown us everything yet either. Clearly the team instructions are to sit back. He's at his best when it's the opposite, I.e the team pressing.

355~~~
I said it on the match thread but he looks to have an the same engine as Park. When everyone else was starting to struggle out there he seemed to be growing in energy. He's going to make such a difference this season.

356~~~
Gave us a lot of presence in midfield and passed it and protected it really well, very impressive debut.

357~~~
That was a midfield masterclass from Morgan. Can't wait to see him do it for us in the PL like he's been doing it for Soton, as well as the CL. What a player he is and again like Darmian, I think he'll prove to be a bargain at £24m.

358~~~
That was as good a midfield performance we've seen. Superb.

359~~~
I'm impressed. Now I can see why people wanted this signing so bad. Some good passing but loved the tackling.

360~~~
Very good performance from Schneiderlin on his debut. Not surprised by his performance as he is well capable of displays like that.

361~~~
Like a rock in midfield. Physically imposing.

Will likely be one of our most reliable signings. Similar in vein to Carrick so many years ago.

362~~~
Told you it would take no time to replace Carrick, we have been so reluctant to buy defensive midfielder for ages! Him Herrera and Sweinsteiger will be the best midfield in premier league. He is immediate upgrade on Carrick and will be better player in no time and the best signing since Carrick, he's like mix of Keano and Carrick, fantastic player to have..

yeah and he will be even better if we chose to press high up the pitch, his stamina is just nonsense

363~~~
Makes up for ignoring matic a couple of seasons ago.

364~~~
I was impressed with hin. Don't want to go overboard because it is pre-season but he looked like the midfielder we've wanted for years.

365~~~
Very good performance, was everywhere.

366~~~
His long range passing was impressive.

367~~~
<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>
He's had an extra week of preseason though hasn't he? He was back training with Saints before our lads came back. Does seem to have good stamina though. I find the idea of him and Herrera (who are both energetic) playing in midfield together quite exciting in that regard.

368~~~
Don't want to go overboard as it's only preseason but this guy...a serious player.
Would have been fuming if we bought Bastian instead of him.
At the same time, why is Carrick being dismissed?
We all know how important he is.

369~~~
He was bullied off the ball quite easily a couple of times.

370~~~
I've loved this guy for the longest time! Played really well and scored!!! Very exciting for the future!

371~~~
Who?

372~~~
I presume he means Michael, that's how I read it anyway.

373~~~
A few ridiculous claims that he's an upgrade on carrick because he can tackle hard and looked tidy vs club america. Carrick went into games last year and made us look a lot better than city/liverpool among others. We'll see if schneiderlin can do the same but for now, if carrick is fit, then himself and herrera are already the best partnership in the league, and just adding basti or morgan will make that stronger, no need to change that winning formula for the first few big game s I don't think

374~~~
We've finished 4th and 7th the previous two seasons. I'm not sure whether we've found the "winning formula" yet. Schweinstiger for example, injuries permitting, <i>is</i> better then anyone we have. If he shows his best in training, he simply has to start, even if we won't a few games last season against City and Liverpool.

375~~~
We hit good form last season with carrick herrera and fellaini and a switch to 4-3-3, our midfield outclassed every team we played, ending with an injury to carrick. We can replace fellaini in that midfield 3 but I think dropping carrick when he was able to dominate the best teams last year is a bit harsh. To say schneid is an upgrade after a game vs club america is plainly ridiculous. 

That said if we are going to play this 4-4-2 then carrick is likely done

376~~~
Agree. Think it's Fellaini who we may see less off. Remember thinking at the time that LVG Made a point along the lines of that sending off could be costly because he'd miss start of season. A good start could be bad news for him. Reckon to start might be Morgan in the league and Bastian in CL/Europe/when we need to control games late on as he gets up to speed. What a nice dilemma for LVG.

377~~~
He did really good, but let's not forget that he is one or two weeks ahead of the other players with the training. His performance was very promising, tho.

378~~~
Not disputing the Schneiderlin bit as I haven't seen enough of him.

But I don't agree regarding Carrick. We as a team dominated a few big games last season. It's not as if he was sat playing football alone. Herrera was key. Mata was key. But I don't think they all should be guaranteed to start just because they played really well in a few big games. Schweinstiger is for example simply a level above at his best to all of them. If Lvg sees him at his best in training you just have to start him. Using an exaggerated example, if Messi were in our squad today, would you play mata ahead of him because he did well in a run of games last season?

Similarly, for Schneiderlin too, it depends on who is looking good in training at the time. If he's looking better than Carrick I'd play him. And visa versa.

379~~~
Think part of the problem in last couple of seasons is we've had good parts of the team but a lot of poor too so the good are having to overcompensate for the poor. I expect having a good right back and third quality cm that can play and mix it physically rather than be a target man who means we potentially lose possession trying to get him into the game will make a big difference

380~~~
I don't disagree. I think our midfield did well last season. Our control on games was the best aspect of last season. But it's always about trying to go up a notch, and this competition for places will further improve our midfield.

381~~~
Since bastian and carrick aren't known for playing a lot of games in a season it likely won't be an issue, and hopefully we get a few good cup runs and they both get to play 20-25 games

382~~~
How can you possibly come to that conclusion?

383~~~
I think when we played 4-3-3 last season and both of them played we looked the best we have looked in years, and made city/spurs and liverpool look very poor in a run of games. Credit to fellaini too I guess. This season I was hoping we could add to that trio and get some cover for carrick which is what it looked like we did... unless we are planning to play 2 CMs again like last night, which personally I wouldn't be happy about but I guess we'll see

384~~~
that's great and all, but 'best partnership in the league', how can you <i>possibly </i>come to that conclusion?

385~~~
I didn't see the match, and haven't seen much of him in general, but in the youtube video on page nine he looks like a massive signing for us. Gotta wonder why no one picked him up earlier when realising that video was from the 2013/14 season.

How does he impose himself on the pitch? Is he a potential future captain?

386~~~
I think the 442 we played was probably just to get the different players on the pitch in two separate, but fairly strong teams

387~~~
I think many people are being over the top here. Understandably so with the hype of seeing a new signing in action. It's great to see us with a proper destroyer type who can pass and move. But I did see him get muscled off the ball a few times and going down for a slide tackle that left us with one body down in our defensive posture. Having said that, obviously reads the game very well, can pass, is intelligent, and scored! Solid 7/10 for me today and it's exciting to see how he improves (and i think he will) once the team gels and gets more match sharp.

388~~~
just based on the quote you just read, referencing how we played better than the other good teams in the league

389~~~
I can't remember Carrick ever having a good pre-season. That old tale about him taking a few weeks or months to get into a rhythm is probably the most legit thing Fergie ever said.

It's just great to have actual alternatives now.

390~~~
Funnily enough, I don't see Chelsea in your list.

391~~~
Do you think YouTube is how clubs scout?

392~~~
In his defence, I don't think they actually played together against Chelsea. Which, I assume is the point he's trying to get across. They are the 'best partnership' because when the two played together we bossed the bigger sides.

393~~~
Those long range passes. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

Was impressed with him today. Did what he had to do and was nice for him to get a goal. 

I personally think Schneiderlin will start the majority of matches, due to his energy. Just a matter of who he starts with.

394~~~
Schneiderlin has the potential to be one of our best players for years to come, and along with Herrera become one of the best midfielders in the league.

I didnt see the game vs Club America but I am delighted that he appears to have slotted straight in without issue, that really bodes well for us as I would rather see him playing than Carrick or Schweinsteiger (primarily due to age).

395~~~
Carrick was injured for chelsea game if you recall

396~~~
Also thought that. Problem now is in that area, if you're out the team we have good enough options to keep you out.

397~~~
Yes, of course I do, that and local radio stations.

398~~~
I'm not sure how much more simple I can make this. You're claiming them to be the best partnership in the league, clearly they're not, clearly Cesc and Matic are. A partnership that played together all season and haven't just played alongside each other a handful of times. A partnership that was pivotal in winning the league. There's simply no way Carrick and Herrera can be called the best partnership in the league ahead of them. Hell, I reckon we'll be lucky to see them play as a partnership more than ten times this season.

399~~~
Very impressed with his 45 minutes. Can't wait to see more of him.

400~~~
I think we will have compatibility issues with the Carrick-Bastien partnership due to both lacking/losing mobility. In that vein I suspect it will be a case of Morgan ** at the base if midfield with Herrera, Mata and Fellaini competing for the third midfield spot. So, if he settles well, he wil play lots of games for us and his ability to play both the #6 & #8 positions will serve him well since it means he can partner virtually any player in our midfield.

401~~~
Why did you ask about me leaving out chelsea when I was describing the teams they played well against and carrick didn't play against chelsea? Why would I have mentioned chelsea? There's no need to get all 'ill make this simple' when you ask a question like yours and I simply answer it. You're dragging this debate out with ill informed questions like that, so if we need to make it simpler maybe do so on your end by taking time and checking who played when or something

402~~~
he was the man of the match, he deserves praise... I think we've seen this before with Herrera ie let's not get carried away he has just one good game etc... and he turned out to be the most important player for now and for the future. It's just pure quality with Schneiderlin, you can already see he will be massive for us, actually you could see it before the transfer happened, because he is exactly what we lacked and needed

403~~~
I quoted you saying they were the best partnership in the league. I asked how you'd possibly come to that conclusion. You didn't give an answer relevant to it really, just that they'd played well together against some good teams, teams that didn't include the team who do have comfortably the best partnership in the league, ergo, how can they possibly be the best partnership in the league? Unless you genuinely believe them better than Cesc and Matic?

404~~~
As good as he was, he wasn't as good as Schweini. . Bastian absolutely bossed it in the second whereas Schneiderlin was bundled over a few times and passed back a few times. His switches of play were tremendous though. .

405~~~
I really do wonder whether I'm watching/watched a different game to the one some people have been watching on here.

406~~~
so fair enough, you are saying the most consistent partnership, and I think the partnership that played better the few times that they could, and imo carrick fellaini herrera played better on those 5-6 occassions than any other midefield 2 or 3 all season, but again maybe you think different on that point too. I think there's plenty of evidence to suggest this but we are so far apart that we can move on I think

407~~~
Southampton didnt let him go last summer as they lost 4 first teamers and Calum chambers. Spurs were interested in him during last summer window. He tweeted rather valdesesquely and later made up with the team and was reportedly allowed to leave this season. Arsenal were interested as well but didn't feel the need to pay £20m+ for a player they felt they didn't need

408~~~
I understood you were suggesting the Fabregas/Matic partnership (which is a tad overrated imo, and hasn't regularly worked well in big games unless I'm mistaken), but you have to admit you took a pretty convaluted way to make your point! 

Glad with Morgan's debut, he was really brilliant in those first 45 minutes and even though it's only pre season, Club America were no pushovers in midfield and he had to get stuck in. He showed energy and bite, and brilliant range of passing (a couple of very incisive forward passes to Mata could've turned out into very good attacking opportunities had Juan not still been on holiday). Agree with those saying Carrick is replaced and so on is going overboard, Carrick has been the best CM (for me) over the past couple of seasons, and we were really hampered when he was injured. Lots of options in any case for VG, suited both to the bigger and smaller games, looking forward to see how our midfield performs over the year.

409~~~
I think that is why he has bought Schweinsteiger, so that he can rotate with Carrick. Then neither player is overused and will be available at the business end of the season. Carrick is still a very good player, but if he is played too much injuries might happen.

410~~~
Definitely, and we he does get injured, before we had cover, we were royally fecked! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> This is nice, in our CM options we have a mixture of experience, flair, technique, players able to control a game and slow the tempo, more box to box... We were a bit one dimensional in CM last year and it actually worked better in big matches, so it's nice to have a vast array of options there to approach games differently.

411~~~
Very impressed with Morgan. I think you can just see he will be absolutely huge for us. Him and Herrera can have a great blend I feel.

412~~~
For me it's got to be Herrera&Schneiderlin+1 behind them. Their energy and tenacity in the oponents half with Carrick or BFS behind them is the perfect blend.

413~~~
This is my thinking too. 

May even call for a new hashtag #HerreraAndSchneiderlinPlusOne

414~~~
#HerreraAndSchneiderlinPlusNine

That's all that matters.

415~~~
You're right, you and Henderson were the best.

416~~~
I was impressed with him last night, 
used the ball better than i expected, was a good debut and im looking forward to seeing more of him

417~~~
Imagine him playing on a pitch where players on his own team and himself arent slipping over cos of the conditions.

And we now have him, Herrera, Carrick, Basti as choices. So this is what its like to have a midfield. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

418~~~
Fellaini is going to struggle to get a game in central midfield this season.

419~~~
Schweini looked a class above even being 10 kg overweight. Schneiderlin is a nice combatant who can spray the occasional Rooney cross ball I guess.

420~~~
Haha, me too.

421~~~
He was really good last night but I also thought Bastian looked different class in the second half. I'm looking forward to seeing them play together. We've got some good midfield options now.

422~~~
He provides the legs in midfield. It's amazing how much he gets in the way of, we have definitely lacked a player like him!

423~~~
He provides something our midfield has missed for absolutely years and years. With his abilities (coupled with Herrera) it really should free up Carrick/Basti to control matches. A bit like what Juve were doing with Pirlo (and what we should have done with Scholes imho)

424~~~
Me too. I thought Schweinsteiger looked a tad rusty personally but it's understandable as he's done a weeks less training (and two weeks less then Schneiderlin).

425~~~
I just hope we see a 3 man midfield next match.
I think pretty much all of them played well individually (carrick started slow but he had some great forward passes and improved as the game wore on imo).
But none of them really ... all of them looked a bit unfamiliar with each other. First match together and playing in a 2 man midfield so hard to look good though.
Hererra, schweinsteiger looked the better combination of the two to me. 
I'd probably be looking to get carrick, herrera into a 3 man midfield initially though to provide a bit of continuity from last season while other positions settle a bit.

426~~~
Just watched his highlights of the match, very impressed.

427~~~
Would love to see him with Herrera and Bastian fecking Schweinsteiger as a midfield trio. Lots of energy and skill in that midfield

428~~~
Ffs

430~~~
Schweini is much the better footballer. Good enough addition though and has age on his side.

431~~~
It looked like he was playing with a bit more freedom than he did under Koeman (understandably, with this being preseason). If Schneiderlin's natural passing game is more like that, I think we could have a top player on our hands.

432~~~
Can't wait to see him and Schweinsteiger on the pitch together.  Should complement each other nicely. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

433~~~
Ha ha, nice response.

434~~~
From SaintsWeb. FFS what can one season in 7th place and one season in 4th place do. Trasfer from Southampton to Manchester is sideways move now <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1.50 and 3.46

<img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

are you watching Wayne?

436~~~
Schneiderlin and Herrera with Carrick or Steiger behind will be a brilliant midfield. The front 2 can press all day long, and have the legs to get box to box no problem. Allowing Steiger or Carrick to to pick out the passes, it will work lovely.

437~~~
yeah but apparently according to some people here he's just headless tackler, bossed the game unlike Carrick who was still on holiday

438~~~
Saw quite a few 'rag' posts whilst lurking around, bit surprised they're a bit bitter with us.

439~~~
The lad came up the ranks with them, why shouldn't he want to better himself. They all have Matt Le Tissier syndrome.

440~~~
Might have something to do with the final game in the 04/05 season where we had nothing to play for and still beat them to send them down.

441~~~
Some overreactions here. I like Schneiderlin too, but he is still at least level behind 34 year old Carrick. His first touch, ball control, short passing are nowhere near Carrick's level, if Carrick stays fit I highly doubt he'll start many games ahead of him.

He still time on his side though, unlike Carrick.

442~~~
I wouldn't put him at Carrick's level just yet IMO.

He's a lot more refined and shows more promise than a 25 year old Carrick did though.

443~~~
The same applies for Carrick in other departments of the game, which Schneiderlin does better. Don't want to take anything away from Carrick, just saying.

My thoughts exactly. 

I was really impressed with Schneiderlin. Good positioning, making a lot of successful tackles and showed good vision and passing ability. His goal was the icing on the cake. Fantastic header with great weight.

Schweinsteiger did ok, but wasn't anything near to his best yet. People are excited we signed him and there is every reason to be, but there is a lot more to come from him.

444~~~
Madness

445~~~
some people really do their best to sound like fools here. Carrick will probably be rated higher than anyone 10 years after his retirement. This is really getting silly<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

446~~~
Schneiderlin has pace strength and mobility on his side. A midfielder isn't just rated on his passing.

447~~~
His passing is excellent, but still not as exquisite as Carrick's, even when Carrick was his age. Though on the other hand, he's got a lot more grit and proactivity compared to a younger, or even current Carrick.

448~~~
Carrick at 25 was someone who could control games. Don't think that is Schneiderlin's forte. Different type of midfielders.

449~~~
People spent years on here moaning that Carrick never took control of games, and would always let Scholes run the game, and just play second fiddle to him. Don't get me wrong, Carrick has always been a fantastic player, and I used to defend him on here for years, but lets no rewrite history and make Carrick of 2006 to be the same as now, because he isn't. He's only become more of a leader and controller as he's got older and more experienced (and also once Scholes retired). 

I would expect the same thing with Morgan. He's got a very good passing range, but it will take a few years of learning and experience before he can control games in the way Carrick can now. I actually think they're very similar signings in terms of age, ability, potential etc etc

450~~~
Carrick was always a better passer but he's not close to Morgan in terms of athleticism and tackling.

451~~~
When you have Scholes by your side, you obviously play second fiddle. Much like Busquets and Xavi. Busquets had all the quality to control games even at that age, but he let Xavi take control of the tempo of games because Xavi was better.

452~~~
Regarding his squad number, are we expecting him to take #6 from Evans?

453~~~
I hope he gets the #6.

454~~~
That would be better, too many high numbers for me.

455~~~
Darmian taking #2 from Rafael
Schweinsteiger will probably want to succeed Cleverley with #23
Depay will be an interesting choice, I've seen 14 mentioned but that will depend on Hernandez I'd imagine.

456~~~
Not sure why Carrick and Schneiderlin are being compared, I think it's obvious that it's Carrick and Schweinsteiger that will compete for the #6 role with Schneiderlin alongside them to add athleticism, speed and energy.

457~~~
Exactly. Which also makes sense given their age and injury records too.

458~~~
Disagree. If Schweinsteiger is healthy, I think it's:

Schweinsteiger-Herrera
--Carrick/Schneiderlin--

as the midfield 3. In a 2, probably one of Herrera or Schweinsteiger gets dropped for Schneiderlin's qualities you mention above.

459~~~
Schweinsteiger doesn't have the legs to play box to box anymore, putting him and Carrick in the same team causes the same problems Bayern had with him and Alonso. They are both in the Pirlo phase where their strength is to sit deep and control games with their passing, Ander and Schneiderlin provide the energy and hustle in front of them, like Vidal and Marchisio.

460~~~
Agree with this.

461~~~
Indeed. Playing Carrick and Bastian in the same team would be suicidal against a high tempo team

462~~~
Yeah, I agree. Physically Morgan trumps a young Carrick too. Despite being 6'1 Carrick always seemed a bit stringy and unable to exert himself physically.

463~~~
It could absolutely go that way, but I don't think Schneiderlin is quite the box to box force or clever short passer than those Juve CMs are, so I think we'd be best off with a more asymmetrical formation with Schweinsteiger a bit deeper and Herrera really looking to get forward as often as possible.

Memphis-Rooney--------
-------------Herrera-Mata
--Schweinsteiger---------
--------Schneiderlin------

Gets everyone on the field in their best position except for Mata, and he has 2 targets ahead + Herrera and a fullback on his right as options for his through passes, so should be okay.

Not sure it's Van Gaal's way, but I think it would prove the best solution over the course of the season for us, assuming Di Maria does indeed leave. If our fullbacks want to go forward it's good to have Schneiderlin's athleticism to cover for them (or the CBs when they go wide to do so) and Schweinsteiger is smart enough to know when to push forward and make it a normal 4-3-3 with him pushed up a bit higher and to the left and when he needs to be very central.

464~~~
I don't see LvG liking that lopsided formation or Schweinsteiger as the furthest forward CM personally. If he wants to go a different route I'd imagine a 4-2-3-1.

------------Rooney
Memphis--Herrera---Pedro
---Scweini--Schneiderlin

465~~~
Not his best half that one..

466~~~
Him and Carrick won't play together in a 2 once the season starts. His cross field passing is brilliant however.

467~~~
Does well to win the ball on corners but switched off badly for the goal. Did not get on the ball as often as Carrick looked to be playing much further forward than him.

468~~~
Got turned for the goal but always showing for the ball and some neat passing and won the ball back a couple times early on. I also think he played a nice first time pass on the build up to our first goal but have to double check.

469~~~
Got completely sold for the goal, but some of his long passes were nice.

470~~~
well hes not a left back <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

471~~~
Schneiderlin will be competing with Blind for the defensive role in midfield. I dont think in an ideal situation Van Gaal wants to play Schweinstiger and Carrick. It'll be one of the two if Herrera is fit.

472~~~
Have I missed something?

473~~~
No, I was just hypotheticalizing.

474~~~
I think he was fine apart from getting turned a bit easily for the goal.

475~~~
Think his passing and touch wasn't quite as good as it was on Friday.. Nothing alarming, just wasn't as good as the rest in that half

476~~~
I was kind of impressed by his passing, tbh. Granted, he didn't always find a teammate, but that was more down to a lack of concentration than anything else. His technique and weight of pass was very good... he was just a little sloppy with his decision making. He'll get better when we start the season.

477~~~
Must of watched a different game to most people as I really thought he was the pick of the midfielders today. Granted he turned off for the goal but he was a threat at set pieces and I thought his passing was forward thinking and incisive.

478~~~
Big boots to fill

479~~~
He may not be at Carrick level yet but he covers more inches of pitch and he's faster. Lack of mobility was one of United's biggest problems last year. With more and more teams defending with 10 men against us we need to make sure that the ball move quickly while making sure we can't get knocked down by quick counters. Schneiderlin can do that. I wonder if Carrick still can

480~~~
Sell him already. Pointless signing!!!

481~~~
Disappointed in him today. Poor in possession and looked lethargic. Probably nervous because of the opposition.

482~~~
Very quiet game by him. I watched the game on 19 inch screen so I though the announcers read Carrick instead of him few times but it wasnt that. Schneiderlin just wasnt involved too much.

483~~~
Thought he did pretty well defensively, but Herrera and Carrick are both better then him, especially on the ball where they are on a level to him IMO. Still got stuck in though and having him helps us defensively immensely I think.

484~~~
A bit meh.

485~~~
He was okay. What can you really tell from pre-season friendlies though? They have very little bearing on the upcoming season, it feels just like something to do before the real thing starts.

486~~~
He was decent enough, intercepted and tackled a bit. Nothing special.

487~~~
Not what I expected, not in terms of passing, because I know he's not really renown for his passing, but his break up play wasn't what I expected. At times, he seems to have lost his man pretty easily and didn't look to have much energy. Hopefully it's just a bad game because we know what he can give. He's shown it in the EPL the last two seasons - against top teams too.

488~~~
I'm not sure, but I'm going to guess that despite being under strength that could have been the best team he has faced? As always, barce on another level when moving the ball and very quick at closing down. Good experience.

489~~~
Pretty solid to be fair. Reckon he will keep going forward and become a class player for us.

490~~~
I think Gary Neville would call it 'silent domination' tonight. <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

Jokes aside, in expecting him to be a huge player for us this season.

491~~~
No idea what you are expecting from this player, but he isn't going to be smashing the ball in from 30 yards every game. He will do the dirty work of closing people down and getting stuck in, as well as moving the ball quickly and being clever with his distribution - all which he did well enough today. Obviously it wasn't his best game, but if you think that was 'abit meh' then you will be saying it a lot this season and won't like this player.

492~~~
Must have been watching a different game to me then.

493~~~
I disagree, he didn't do any of those things well today, looked a bit lost if I'm being honest. I'm not worried because his previous performances with Southampton show he is a good player, but tonight he was a bit of a passenger. Looked young, naive, unsure etc etc. fellaini was miles better when he came on.

494~~~
Wasn't impressed at all. I imagine he isn't used to being pressed to that extent.

495~~~
Did ok, has had better games. Wasnt terrible.

Im still hoping to see him, Carrick (or basti) + Herrera in a midfield three (maybe we will see that in Europe away from home)?

496~~~
Thought he played well. And did his role well

497~~~
Tend to agree with this. I'm a huge fan of him but he was caught in possession a good few times and positionally got caught out a few times. Not a massive concern at this point though as Barcelona are one of the best pressing teams in the world so it won't get much tougher.

498~~~
That was my impression. He noticeably took too long on occasion and was completely caught out by someone who had chased after him. 

Still though, to be expected really. He'll improve.

499~~~
Was fine, will get used to it. Playing for us is obviously something different in how the opposition attack us.

500~~~
Apart from one moment of holding onto the ball too long and a misplaced pass thought he was OK. he is not the kind of player some seem to think he is judging by this thread. He was asked to perform a holding role, he is primarily a holding player and I though he played the role adequately and will get better at it as time goes on.

501~~~
I was not impressed with his performance yesterday, thought he wasn't great on the ball and two matches in a row got beat in or near our box creating dangerous situations.

Still think he'll be a great addition, just needs time to settle in and understand the "philosophy".

502~~~
Looked ok to me. This is what he has come here for to play against top teams in highly competitive games. It is a step up for him we need to be understanding that it will take time.

503~~~
As most of our new players, needs time to settle in. I can see him doing better in the EPL though

504~~~
Sure does love doing the Rooney trademark pass out to the wing. He was alright again, nothing special. A midfield 2 of him next to Carrick just won't work though as it's too defensive. Might work with Schweinsteiger better as he's more attack minded. I don't think Schneiderlin should be first choice in midfield though. On the ball he has a lot to improve on... Should be 4th choice behind Herrera, Carrick and Schweiny for me, or at least part of a 3 man midfield alongside herrera.

505~~~
Was decent i thought.

506~~~
He was good in the first game but I don't think his performances since have been as good, he's better with less on the ball responsibility IMO.

507~~~
Ok player in the preseason games. Schweini, while lagging behind in fitness, has actually been better.

508~~~
No he hasn't

509~~~
he was good in all games , probably the best game was his first but he maintain good consistency throughout. He will be much better if we play more aggresive counter attacking football which looks a bit concern to me but still future star player. I actually believe that he could play in 2men midfield like the old days with Herrera

510~~~
Where is his best position? #6 or #8?

511~~~
Apparently, according to this board, wont make one bit of difference to our team.

512~~~
Who said that?

513~~~
People judging players too heavily from meaningless pre-season games shocker..

514~~~
Mostly heard good about him from fans here? He is a quality player.

515~~~
Read this forum mate. Midfield is pointless because Blind at CB and no DDG in goal

516~~~
And Rooney can't score 10 goals.

517~~~
There is some nutters on here this man is the most important signing we've made in a long long time even if he plays at the level he did at Southampton hes a major improvement to us. I'd be really surprised aswell if he doesnt find another gear since his big step up I predict a real future fans favorite here. Class player who is unlike any of the other midfielders we currently posses.
Probably even more well rounded than Herrera too, Man I hope to see the two of them start along with Carrick tomorrow I reckon them 3 in the middle would blow spurs off the park but I fear Herrera may only appear as a substitute.

518~~~
And LvG doesn't know what he's doing.

519~~~
Really keen to see him play. Was excited when we first signed him and although the pre-season games were a little disappointing, I think he's going to do really well.

520~~~
If he can boss around midfield like he did for Southampton at Old Trafford last season, he will be a quality player for us. Some shield to have in your front of your defence.

521~~~
Just wondering if having both of Carrick and Morgan in the same team kind of reduces the mobility in midfield. They are both #6 and aren't exactly very mobile in terms of their movement up and down the pitch, at least from what I have seen. Playing both of them at the same time seems a bit of overkill especially when we are at home and opponents usually look to play on the counter attack. I am glad we signed him though, seems a perfect replacement for Carrick (well, as perfect as possible to get) and has good experience of PL. It'd be interesting to see how he and Carrick fares in midfield tomorrow and how they provide support to attack.

522~~~
I think Schneiderlin is very mobile. Got forward plenty at Southampton, with Wanyama sitting behind.

523~~~
Oh, that's great news. I never really took notice of Morgan very seriously before we signed him and kind of took words of commentators during the game as the evaluation of his performance. He seemed to be more like a passer than a Khedira type of player who makes run beyond the midfield though. We have such serious lack of movement in the team during last season and even during pre-season. I am just worried about our lack of movement. Apart from Shaw and Darmian, none of our players showed great movement during the pre-season with almost every one waiting to be played at their feet. I might be wrong though, but that's how I saw the game.

524~~~
You're right to have a worry though, because even with Schneiderlin going forward, there will be spaces between midfield and defense like we saw in preseason. Wish we tried Mata in that #10 position, but even he tends to stay upfield a lot

525~~~
I know Mata is a fantastic player when played according to the system but he is really a hindrance when we try to make quick transition especially in the wings. In the #10 position perhaps he could pick up the pass and then dart forward to receive it in the edge of area to sneak-in a shot. But we have two very good passers playing in midfield who can pick up any kind of runs our forward make. 
May be that's why we are looking into Pedro, to replace Mata. That way playing Morgan and Carrick/Bastian would make more sense as we have more pace on wings for vertical play. But if we play with Mata, I'd prefer Herrera -Carrick midfield combo as opposed to Morgan - Carrick simply because Herrera is more dynamic and offers better quality in terms of offensive play and forward areas. I guess we'd never know how LvG plans to play the team though as we found last season.  I hope we don't have to wait till March to play with some style.
Going back to Mata, switching him to #10 would mean Memphis playing on right which would limit his attacking potential of cutting in from left and shooting. Young also plays better on the left wing as he can cut inside to open up the space and let overlapping LB make the wider runs. Sometimes it looks as if Mata is the problem, other times it looks like everything else is because we just don't seem to play to a rhythm or style.

526~~~
I think someone needs to brief the BT commentary crew that he's not even 5'11'', they're talking about him as if he's a Toure or Fellaini type.

527~~~
I'm a fan but he hasn't had the best start. Keeps fouling and mistiming long raking passes.

528~~~
he mistimed as many as Carrick, the start wasn't the best but no one has played well tbf, we are boring to watch again. Expected little bt more from the opening game at Old Trafford..

529~~~
Can see what he brings, but it's just not coming off. That will change.

530~~~
He's been decent after the goal with his pressing along with Carrick.

Everyone passing wise hasn't exactly been great.

531~~~
Yeah, not a great half. Erratic passing and three or four fouls, also lost the ball close to our goal which could have cost us, though that was partly the shockingly nervous/poor Romero's fault.

532~~~
Started poorly along with Carrick but the two of them completely took over the midfield after the goal.

533~~~
Meh.

534~~~
He played well. He was responsible for a lot of us breaking up the play and getting an early attack high up the pitch going.

535~~~
Lost the ball quite a few times, needs to react quicker when he has the ball at his feet as Tottenham players seem to know how to press him. I'm sure he'll improve.

536~~~
Making interceptions for fun. 

Keep it up and we'll remain comfortable.

537~~~
I thought he looked nervous for about 15 minutes then started asserting himself more and more. Decent performance.

538~~~
Decent. Will become a very important Player for us. However, with him and Carrick without Schweini and Herrera we are lacking a bit creativity in the middle it seems.

539~~~
I thought we was pretty good. I'd rather play one of him or Carrick with Herrera, rather than both (I think Schweinsteiger will need to be eased into the team.)

540~~~
A typically combative performance from him. Took him a while to assert himself and didn't end the game brilliantly but from 20-75 I thought he was the best midfielder on the pitch.

541~~~
I liked him, though I really wouldn't pair him with Carrick.

542~~~
Big things for the lad will be a permanent fixture for us.

543~~~
Decent debut, for all new players there will still be an adjustment period even if they played in the pre-season matches. He got better as the game went on.

544~~~
He's active, but not so good in possession. I think we need Herrera or Schweinsteiger in our midfield. The depth of the passing wasnt enough, and we lost possession too much. But his defensive output is great.

545~~~
Decent performance.

546~~~
Got better as the game went on. Decent enough.

547~~~
Great ball winner! He is very aggressive, and puts the opposing midfielders under a lot of pressure, and wins the ball quite often as a result.

As for all of our new signings, I expect it will take some time before we see his very best. Thought he struggled a bit in possession today, and it looked like he couldn't cope with the tempo of Spurs' pressing at times. I'll put it down to start-of-the-season rustiness.

548~~~
He's a good player but I don't like the idea of him being the deepest midfielder in our team, picking the ball up from our defenders. He's a much worse passer than Carrick. Not entirely sure what the logic behind playing him deep and Carrick further forward is.

549~~~
Looked nervous on the ball in the first half but improved as the match went on. Defensively he was very good throughout the game and just by having him in the team our defense looks better than last season.

550~~~
Very good defensively. Not so great at using the ball, but he's shown last season he is a good ball player and can use it very well, so no concerns there. It will come with sharpness.

551~~~
Not a good performance. He has to either build attacks better or push forward and play box to box better.

552~~~
Personally, I thought he was great. Broke down a lot of their momentum with his interceptions. Great work off the ball from him and seemed to get more confident.

553~~~
Good defensively, but some of his passes didn't come off, i blame it on the settling in period.

554~~~
Broke up the play well but was jittery with his passing.

555~~~
Thought he was ok. Felt a bit nervous when he got the ball with his back to goal, though. Didn't look assuring at all. Guess that was down to the great pressing of Spurs. Got better as the game went on, though. Put himself about and made some nice tackles.

556~~~
Needs to get out of his cage. Defers the ball to others too much.

557~~~
What time of player do you think he is? He's not going to make or score lots of goals. He did what we bought him for today, broke up play and added some legs to the midfield. Thought he was good personally.

558~~~
Wut? He's over 6ft

559~~~
Only all sources say he's not. 

Let's do that thing where we compare him next to other players.

560~~~
Off the ball we haven't had a midfielder like him since Roy Keane left the club. He's considerably better than that Canadian clown we brought in, so don't mention him.

Some iffy moments here and there, but it's clear what he offers the midfield.

561~~~
That Canadian clown was an excellent player when he was fit. If he stayed fit for more than one season he would have been a great buy.

562~~~
You're totally embarrassing yourself here. Both players misplaced some passes and Schneiderlin showed complete opposite, what you claim is simply not true. Watch the game next time and stop being biased...

Schneiderlin with his energy is better used all around the pitch rather than going for balls deep, there is true in that.

563~~~
I'd say he was underwhelming. Will give him time to impress though, obviously. Gradual improvements would be good.

564~~~

565~~~
Better in gaining possession then actually keeping it, but I think he'll learn that as he goes along.

566~~~
That's what we are missing though. He made lots of strong tackles today and threw his weight about all over the midfield. Once he settles in his job will be to do just that and play his teammates in.

567~~~
He was a bit sloppy at times but showed good energy in winning the ball back. Not bad but not great either. I expect more from him in future.

568~~~
Why would I biased against Schneiderlin? I'm delighted we got him and fully expect him to be a mainstay of the team for years to come. He's a good passer but not a great passer, I didn't think that was particularly contentious. He has lots of other qualities to compensate.

569~~~
He's good passer not at all much worse than Carrick as you suggested, that's what just annoys me mate. You know it's not true or is simply Blind. It's like with Keane a lot of people think he was just about good passer because he was known for his tackling and leadership, he was great passer and not really that much between him and Carrick who is massively overrated here by some people.

Neither of the players, Schneids and Carrick, had a brilliant game, btw great to see Van Gaal getting at least one thing right subbing Sweiny on for Carrick, both are too slow and good passers, would have been a mess with the two at the base, not enough movement an aggression, perhaps that's what Steiger brings into the team little bit of Carrick with more aggression

570~~~
It's a bit of a weird thing to get annoyed about but whatever floats your boat.

571~~~
Schneiderlin's passing isn't a patch on Carricks man. It's not even debatable. Schneiderlin is a decent passer, and has a good passing range, but it's certainly not a strong point of his like tackling.

572~~~
He improved later in the game. Was shaky just like the whole team was at the start. The defensive side of his game is good.

573~~~
Agree with the comment about him being better at winning possession than keeping it. Having watched him on tour as well as today's match, his technical ability isn't on the same level as most of the midfield players we have been used to seeing over recent years. On a rainy night in November away from home I think he'll be an asset but not convinced he should be starting home games unless he is alongside Herrera.

574~~~
He was shaky. But his ability to break up play makes him a game changer, if he can improve his overall play he'll be a good buy.

575~~~
Don't see how can anyone (bar <a class="username" data-user="84491, @m1y2" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84491/">@m1y2</a>) can disagree with this. Schneiderlin is a good passer, but Carrick is miles better in that aspect.

I think that Schneiderlin was quite bad at passing in the first half but later improved. Still it was a very solid defensive performance from him.

Still think that the best way forward is a midfield of him, one of Carrick or Schneiderlin and Herrera. It would have everything you want from a midfield.

576~~~
Shaky start, but grew into the game. Was bossing it by the end.

577~~~
Yes shaky start then settled down and had a decent game. This is what I like about him, he always looks to improve. He will grown into our team well I reckon. Better him starting by learning how to play in the team and getting better as we go on, rather than straight out sensational and then never being seen again like Di Maria.

578~~~
Good ball winner and he he can develop into the player that regains control and then immediately can play the killer pass forward we are in business...

579~~~
He's not known for being an incisive penetrative passer, although I'm sure training with Carrick and Schweinsteiger every day will do him no harm.

What he provides is pressure from midfield, he's got a real presence and you saw how many times he forced errors out of the spuds midfield.

Also that was his first game of real football at United. Let's give him a few before we rip into fees and better options and what he's shit at eh? I think he's a real adrenaline player and will be massive for us in big games.

580~~~
Tbh his passing was what i expected it to be, he is trying to add the more creative passes to his game as that's required for LvG's philosophy, but it's not what made him the player most of us wanted. 

That being said his passing should get better as he settles in the team, let's not forget early on spurs were putting in a lot of pressure as our front 4 basically had no impact for 30 minutes or so.

581~~~
He was shite.

582~~~
This guy will be a top midfielder for us, not seen anyone press like that since Fletch in 2009

583~~~
Is he really? If anything, it's comments like this that are embarrassing (although the idea of embarrassment on a football forum is a bit dodgy to begin with.)

584~~~
"You're totally embarrassing yourself here. Both players misplaced some passes and <i>[insert name of player I'm getting defensive about]</i> showed complete opposite, what you claim is simply not true."

585~~~
<img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>

586~~~
A bit of a shaky start but he really grew into the game. Five tackles, three interceptions to combine with Carricks single tackle and four interceptions is fine work for a midfield combination. As the season goes on I really see Carrick moving forward into more of an 8 role to dictate play while Schniederlin plays a floating holding player. They will get there, it isn't ready yet.

I have a strange feeling that Schniederlin is going to be getting the sort of praise Carrick has been getting at the end of the season and a lot of users will see the way Morgan's defensive game is probably the more viable going forward than the luxury that Carrick brings. They will be an excellent combination if Van Gaal would stop gimping his system to include virtually no instinctive creativity.

587~~~
Great to see him settle down and find his feet in the game. Will have a big season in my opinion.

588~~~
This guy is pretty good. Love his attitude and energy. Got a feeling he could be our most important player this season.

589~~~
looks fully integrated into the team now. will play a crucial role in controlling matches for us with his presence in midfield (if he stays fit - and I hope he does!!)

590~~~
I'd like to see him play without Carrick beside him.

591~~~
He gets through a hell of a lot of work.

592~~~
Good game, lots of unnoticed work which is essential for our play. Love to see him in our team really. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

593~~~
He was very good in the second half. Him and Schweinsteiger seem to have a very good understanding.

594~~~
Pressing monster.

595~~~
Solid, look so much more solid with him in the team.

596~~~
Really like the look of him, especially alongside Schweinsteiger. Gonna be an important player for us.

597~~~
Improvement on the last game, he just needs to have better awareness of what's behind him. He's admitted this weakness during the tour and said he wants to learn that from Schweinsteiger.

598~~~
A lot better tonight.

599~~~
Thought he was superb. Pressed and tackled well & got forward at times. Brings a balance to our midfield, I think he's vital if we're going to have a successful season.

600~~~
Started off a bit shit but became a beast when Schweinsteiger and Herrera came on. We looked rarely in trouble with them three in midfield.

601~~~
Showed tonight why we bought him. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

602~~~
We played with Schweini, Morgan, Herrera midfield in 2nd half. Let that sinc in. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

603~~~
Yeah this. Those 3 just have to be the midfield.

604~~~
I think this guy deserves a lot of credit for why we look so solid. 5 tackles and 5 interceptions in that game, he disrupts the opposition. Still has one too many slack moments though.

605~~~
AGREE

606~~~
Hopefully the manager sees this, and is just waiting for Schweinsteiger to get fully fit.

607~~~
I reckon Schweini will start on Tuesday.

608~~~
Yup, we need to play those 3 in midfield on a regular basis.

609~~~
Minister of pressing.

610~~~
Passing range like Carrick with a combative nature when pressing. Really good player.

611~~~
Was thinking of something clever to say. Think I'll leave it at 'this'. 

Gets better every game. Ladies and gentlemen if Van Gaal wants us to look and play like Ajax 95 then he has sure found his Edgar Davids. Pitbull.

612~~~
the less you hear his name the better he's played. unless he scores of course. he's playing his role wonderfully well.

613~~~
Makes me think. How did Rodgers shop half the Southampton team without picking this guy up?

614~~~
He's still far away from his best form but like most of our players need some more time and games

615~~~
Pretty much our destroyer tonight. Did a good job. Midfield looks made of steel with him.

616~~~
So happy to have him. Misplaces some passes sure, but he gets through so much work, tracks runners, presses, makes tackles to stop counter-attacks, makes runs forwards to make space for other players... Super important to have someone like him when Carrick's on, and he looks even more impressive when Schweini and Herrera are alongside him.

617~~~
Part of the reason the defense is playing well. Also made a surprising amount of runs in to their box.

618~~~
Good player. Has the potential to be a right beast for us.

619~~~
Like I said when we signed him, we signed him to be a #8 not a #6.

Runs box to box brilliantly.
Reminds me of Fletcher in his prime.

620~~~
Great athlete and tackles and presses well, needs to be a bit more careful with the ball at times though.

621~~~
Love, love, love Schneiderlin. 

He's so quietly effective. He picks up the right positions, shows for every ball, covers every blade of grass. He's <i>exactly </i>what the midfield has been screaming out for all this time.

622~~~
He was the only one smart enough to say no.

623~~~
I'm just so happy we signed him. Could have easily been an Arsenal player.

624~~~
Thanks Wenger and Rodgers.

625~~~
Maybe my favorite current United player

626~~~
He's lucky, this guy wanted to sign for bloody Spurs but Soton said no.

627~~~
Typical overlooked top performance he was doing for south

628~~~
This. I was elated he stayed because he would have been damn near impossible to sign from Spurs. Im more shocked Gunners passed on him and signed up Arteta for another year. Crazy.

629~~~
Thought he played really well.  Does so many things for us.  One of these days his forays going forward will result in a goal.

Seems like people really think he had a good game. I saw it differently, think he was average and is still behind his best form. Get's caught on the ball too many times, is not mobile enough in midfield and struggles to bring the play/ball forward or to build up our game. However, happy that he's hear and I'm sure he will be much better in the coming weeks

631~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> So true. Still lacks composure on occasion but he's a monster of a ball winner.

632~~~
One of our better players tonight, he really loves to press, doesn't he?<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

633~~~
ampton.

634~~~
His fighting for the ball around 70th minute was class, can't remember who it was (Richards?) that tried to block him from the ball and let it roll out for a goal kick yet he outmuscled and outsmarted the guy and then played some neat pass.

635~~~
His stamina is ridiculous, remember him almost skipping late on, wasn't laboured at all. Not surprised he's the midfielder who's played every minute so far.

636~~~
Yep, Van Gaal praised his energy when we signed him and it shows. He was just fighting for the ball until the end.

637~~~
Guy is phenomenal off the ball. Works hard and is a tackling machine.

Needs to do better on the ball though, especially with keeping the ball/getting pressed. He sometimes sleeps with it and loses posession because of not knowing whats going on around him.

638~~~
The lad is class. His ability to nick the ball even from behind without going to ground is fantastic. His distribution is good. His reading and anticipation is good. His support play and stamina is excellent. This is the start of a beautiful friendship.

639~~~
What an engine he has, I swear he was constantly touching both ends of the pitch. We have seriously missed a player who could do this, as well as other key attributes.

640~~~
5 tackles, 5 interceptions. Solid!!

641~~~
There really is no quantifiable metric for defensive midfielders. Especially with the phantom praise that Carrick has been receiving prior to this season. Personally I think Morgan has been and is already the better player. Another excellent performance this morning, he will in my mind prove to be our best signing this season, if anything so far has been to go by.

642~~~
The guy looks like he has the talent and the engine to do well here. I really like him but he needs to sort the lack of awareness of who is around him when he has the ball in front of the defence. He got caught out taking far too long on the ball and did the same in the first game. Not trying to be harsh as he is new but it will cost us if he doesn't.

643~~~
Our team as a whole just feels more secure, can't help but feel he's playing a huge factor to this. He's quite an intelligent footballer that I'm starting to appreciate a fair amount.

644~~~
Much improved from his first performance. Was one of our best I thought. Worked extremely hard, must have covered some distance.

645~~~
Has to be the first name on the team sheet, he has everything that our midfield lacked for the past few seasons. We didn't have the midfielder with that ball retention capability since peak Fletcher.

646~~~
Everything off the ball was great. He even made a couple good runs in behind or out wide but nobody spotted him. Threat on set pieces too. He'll get 4-5 goals this season, which is more than we normally get from an 8.

His ability on the ball is worse than I thought it would be and he might struggle under high pressure, but that is what should improve with time.

647~~~
He was a one man midfield in the first half!

648~~~
He had too much freedom in the first half. There were about 3 or 4 occasions in the first half where he bombed forward to close down their centrebacks. I prefer him in a more disciplined role further back.

649~~~

650~~~
I think he just needs a little time to get used to how the others around him play.

651~~~
He's basically just taken control of the midfield area for us. Great work defensively. 

Should play with Schweinsteiger really.

652~~~
I really love his energy and competitiveness. The scene where he saved the ball from going out and making that beautiful pass to Darmian. Absolute fantastic protecter/pressing machine and everywhere on the pitch. Just does his job brilliantly, at least defensively so far. Such a fantastic decision to buy him, fits perfetcly in here.

653~~~
Delighted with the start he's made. He gets forward much more than I expected and seems a genuine threat from set pieces.

654~~~
Dude, he plays box to box. 

This guy gives Carrick/Bastian the legs they need.

655~~~
He's fantastic at the negative stuff, the tackling, interceptions and general getting in the way of the opposition. Once he's gotten used to his teammates the positive play will come, although with the likes of Schweinsteiger next to him it doesn't matter too much if it doesn't.

We have made some cracking signings this season on the evidence so far.

656~~~
So happy to have him in our side. There's still a lot more to come but he shields the back 4 so well, gets through a tremendous amount of work, excellent tackler, solid on the ball. Just an all-round top midfielder. And only 25. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

657~~~
He feels like a French, better looking Darren Fletcher to me

658~~~
He's a quality addition with his interceptions, tackles and pressing. I'd like him to improve on his possession play though because at times he does something rather daft with the ball where he would have been better off if he just showed a bit more composure and took his time on the ball. Hopefully he'll learn from playing alongside the likes of Carrick and Schweini.

659~~~
It is a big step up from Southampton to Man Utd and with time I have little doubt he'll be a great signing. Early signs are very promising.

660~~~
Yep that's a good comparison actually. the team of Scholes/Carrick/fletcher was our best midfield for a long time, and Herrera/Schneiderlin/Schweinsteiger could easily replicate that.

The front 3 of Park/Rooney/Ronaldo could be mimicked by Pedro/Memphis/Rooney*

*if he remembers he's a good player.

661~~~
He's been great defensively and brings back the bite we've missed that only Herrera gave us fleetingly last year. However he has to improve on the ball - his spatial awareness is dodgy (he doesn't look around very much before receiving the ball like Scholes and Carrick do) so he's gotten caught on it and tackled quite a bit these 2 games...it also prevents him from making quick passes. Until he learns that I think he should play beside Carrick (with Herrera in front - a pipe dream atm) rather than be the sole player taking the ball off defenders centrally.

662~~~
If that's the case (and you're talking about the 2009-11 version of Fletcher,) then buying Schneiderlin will prove to be a fantastic piece of business.

663~~~
I notice players just running through the center of us untroubled has ceased with him in the side. As many have said he needs to sharpen up on the ball but him and the two fullbacks are a big reason why we look so much more solid defensively right now.

664~~~
He's the tallest 5'11 around. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

665~~~
He seems to be making a massive difference to our solidity, giving the defence a layer of protection - as I knew he would.  Conversely, you can see how much Southampton are missing him.

666~~~

667~~~
Part of that is probably communication from the defense, I've seen Blind, Shaw and Carrick in particular shout out to him that he has someone charging on his back the few times he lost possession, hopefully once he gets used to the teammates, we'll see less of it.

668~~~
No surprise, guy is a machine off the ball.

669~~~
This guy is immense. I'm a huge fan. Our midfield is going to be Schneidy + 1 other for the next 5-7 years. He'll be our future captain as well.

670~~~
Quickly becoming my favorite player. He is quiet, yet so effective at pressing, covering space, and showing for the ball at the right time. Really like is long passing as well. 

Him and Darmian have been superb signings.

671~~~
Our Matic, absolute monster.

672~~~
He's a silent operator. I like it. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

673~~~
Love him I do. Just what we needed.

674~~~
I think he'll be our buy of the season.

675~~~
Missed the match but I'm trilled by the feedback, might for once agree with Carragher on him being the signing of the summer.

676~~~
Off the ball he's been very good, especially his pressing and tracking back. On the ball he has lots of room to improve though

677~~~
He's the signing I was the most eager that we'd complete. That we signed him and Schweiny in the space of a few days was like Christmas come early.

678~~~
He's beautiful

679~~~
Ugliest tattoo contender. But a great footballer.

680~~~
"It was an amazing feeling to play my first game at Old Trafford on the opening day of the season and hopefully I'll play on tonight against Club Brugge because I can't wait to go out there again. Old Trafford is a beautiful stadium and it’s amazing to be able to play there week in, week out.

"The Champions League is another big competition for us and we need to get a good result in the first leg to give us every chance to get through. We will approach it as we do for every game. We will respect them and prepare the same way as always. We will analyse them, look at their strengths and weaknesses and we will be up for the challenge. This competition is one of our top priorities because being in the Champions League is the dream of every footballer.

"To play for such a team like Manchester United is a beautiful thing. We look strong and, personally, I feel like I am getting closer to being 100 per cent physically. I am not quite there yet but it will come. I want to keep improving my game as well. I am not fully satisfied yet with my performances because I know I can do better but I know that will come. I have been pleased to be able to make some good interceptions, but I don’t want to lose any balls when I have possession and that’s what I will continue to improve upon. That will happen as my sharpness gets better.

"I am enjoying getting to know all my team-mates but playing alongside the likes of Michael and Bastian has been a very nice experience. They are amazing players and I just want to do my best to link up with them and to understand their game a bit better. That will come with more game-time and we also talk a lot during the games, so hopefully we can continue to do well together.

"Two wins out of two is very good so far and a very good start to the Premier League. We are happy after the results but still not 100 per cent happy with the performances because we know we can still improve. In the Premier League, it’s all about winning games to win titles, so sometimes you need to be able to get the victories when you don’t have the best performance, and that’s what we’ve done so far.

"It’s been interesting to see how every time we play it’s a huge game for the opposition. I have seen the difference in that since I joined. You see the atmosphere in all our games and you see that we are the team that everyone wants to beat. But I enjoy that and feel ready for it, and I’m focused on helping the team do the best we can in every match."

681~~~
Nice quotes. Good attitude.

682~~~
All of our signings this season seem to have the right attitude.

683~~~
Absolutely love Schneiderlin and everything he brings on the pitch, he's the type of player our midfield has needed for a long time.

Delighted that he's a Manchester United player.

684~~~
I certainly feel a lot calmer when he's on the pitch. Some of his passing decisions are a bit erratic and he can be laboured on the ball but that'll improve after playing with Carrick and Schweinsteiger for a while. Definitely think he'll be our best signing in the long run.

685~~~
I liked at Southampton and for the national team and now like him even more. He's an intelligent player and no doubt he'll work on ironing out his mistakes on the ball.

686~~~
He isn't quite comfortable enough for a midfield two and I think he'll take a further step if we go for a 4-3-3/4-2-3-1 or if our second striker learns to be more available. Absolutely immense defensively and it is a beauty to see how he reads the game then pushes forward aggressively and wins the ball back.

His passing is actually very good for a defensive midfielder but I'm not sure it is good enough to play in a midfield duo where you pretty much need to twist/turn your opponent to have a clear defense splitting pass available, or release the ball accurately under massive pressure.

687~~~
Didn't he play in a midfield two at Southampton alongside Wanyama, behind a front 4?

688~~~
Yeah, that was my thoughts as well. They often deployed a 4-2-3-1.

689~~~
But here we have basti/Carrick as DLP whereas wanyama is also a destroyer like Morgan.

690~~~
This man is a fecking machine. Up and down the pitch all day long

691~~~
Passing not been good enough though

692~~~
Passing has been fine. Guy's a complete monster be interested to see his stats by the end of this game, lost count of his tackles and interceptions.

693~~~
Does he ever get tired ? Ridiculous stamina and pressure from start to finish.

694~~~
Yep, he runs all day. He has 3 lungs.

695~~~
Fast becoming one of my favourite players.

696~~~
Wow, I thought his running was excellent in the first half. Didn't even tire out in the second, doing the same.

697~~~
He's the type of midfielder that you play against who by the 6th minute really starts to make you hate yourself.

698~~~
It's been said before but he's like a prime Darren Fletcher for us. Constantly worked his bollocks off all game.

699~~~
This. Great energy and his defensive contribution is awesome, but he was quite poor on the ball tonight. Passing was sloppy on a few occasions.

700~~~
The Fletcher comparison is pretty apt but physically I think he's more like his French compatriot in Evra, freakish levels.

701~~~
No fuss Morgan. He just works.

702~~~
Probably my favourite performance of his so far, we really needed our spine to be solid in a game of this magnitude and he was very reliable and gave us a great platform from which to mount attacks and was solid defensively too. He is the key piece of the midfield puzzle, without him we have no real defensive stability or legs in the midfield.

703~~~
Brilliant work rate but again, on the ball he is too anonymous.

704~~~
The Broom.

705~~~
He did play as a box to box player along side Wanyama. But Before that season, he played as a proper defensive midfielder for their team.

706~~~
Needs to make better decisions with the ball if he has ambitions of being box to box.

707~~~
I think it's great that his name isn't mentioned a lot when he's playing, means he's doing his job right.

Great engine and energy, his passing was a bit worse than his previous games though. Still a good performance.

708~~~
I like him, he does need to improve his decision making around the box but that will come with time.

709~~~
passes it well enough. he is the shield.

710~~~
I'm not worried about his passing, he's shown enough at Southampton to say he'll improve. His off the ball work is top class.

711~~~
Too many slack moments again. Got through a lot of work again though.

712~~~
87% passing accuracy and 10 kms distance covered. He's been immense for us.

713~~~
More Hargreaves than Fletcher for me. Startling lack of awareness on the ball at times but non-stop energy and aggression.

714~~~
Little sloppy but an excellent player who will only get better as we go along. First choice midfielder.

715~~~
I'm surprised by his long range passing, it's actually very good

716~~~
Its always been good tbf to him

717~~~
he did very well tonight he made some very good interceptions that could have led to danger.

718~~~
Had a feeling this thread would get less replies than what it deserved. The guy did his Jin excellently. Solid in midfield.

719~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> He thinks he is still short athletically.

720~~~
I suspect it's not going to be until our first really big game before Morgan really stands out

721~~~
Only complaint with him is his tendency to take a few touches too many which leads to him being dispossessed in danger areas. Other than that he's top notch. Lost count of the amount of tackles and interceptions he made tonight.

722~~~
His stamina is phenomenal. He's going to get better with time and be a brilliant player for us.

723~~~
Very steady and efficient player

724~~~
Contributes to all phases of play and is brilliant at winning the ball back. I also have a sneaky suspicion he will nick a few important goals with his late runs in to the box.

Not the most polished on the ball but more than good enough considering the good work he puts in elsewhere. Definitely a big part of looking more defensively stable.

725~~~
Cut out a couple sloppy touches/errors, he'll be fecking great. As someone said on the page before, I think we'll really see the job he does against someone like Chelsea.

726~~~
He will play exactly as he has been all season but he will suddenly have "settled in" once he does it in a big game.

727~~~
Maybe its early days but he doesnt look better on the ball for me than Blind. Great to have him tho, his stamina, interceptions and tackles are world class. It's great to have a stopper in front of our defence. Our defence looked great 2nd half. We got the ball almost immediately, Brugge were shit tho.

728~~~
His 'sloppy' play on the ball isn't even the norm for him, if anyone has watched him at Southampton. He will cut it out.

729~~~
His passing in the final third is kinda dodgy. Plus he sometimes gives it away in dangerous areas

730~~~
This. Though I do hope he will get some support in the middle. Although Schweini is 2x the mobility of Carrick, them two in the middle park won't be dominating midfield battles on their own.


They're valid concerns but for me, it's mostly irrelevant. Those passes we're seeing isn't someone lacking technique or guile, those passes are off because we're watching someone making dozens of high intensity runs to intercept, to break up play, to get involved in the attacking front despite being on his own at times, 'insert any half decent valid argument against Carrick in a 2 man midfield'.

You could ask him to be more wise/conserve that energy but imo then we'll have two Carricks in the team offering great 'positioning' and 'shepherding' of the game but at the same time not really affecting above standard defensively or offensively.

Basically let's find him two more mobile and forward thinking midfielders and you will see his passing 'improve'.

I do worry about his physical durability during the whole season. I'm not saying we need to protect him but we will need to rotate to keep him fresh. Right now, he is a one man destroyer and no matter how fit or prepared you are, if you play game after game your levels will decrease (look at Matic 2nd half of the season).

731~~~
Is brilliant in his off-the-ball stuff. Still a little sloppy with touches and passing but I expect that will improve.

732~~~
His on the ball performances will improve, said himself in his interview he knows he's given it away cheaply sometimes and that he's looking to retain it better as he approaches full fitness.

733~~~
Yes, actually surprised by his lack of awareness, which was IMO one of his strengths in possession for Southampton.

734~~~
I think he does a good job marshaling and locking down the midfield as he has great positioning but the physical qualities to cover and recover. In the final third his passing isn't as assured but that's not his role. If he can grab a few goals over the season with late runs, while doing a good job in midfield we're set. His passing is good from deep and good enough with the others around him

735~~~
we are laughing at 24 million .. hes been great for us and how the boss wants to play. Very good purchase, just like everyone else we have bought.

736~~~
Tough one deciding who's the best value for money from the summer signings, Schneiderlin certainly has a shout at £24m.

737~~~
They all were well priced in fairness.  Even Romero looks a trick on a free <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

738~~~
Now Bild are saying we got BFS for £6m. <img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

739~~~
I really like him, and he's only going to get better in my opinion.

740~~~
Was anyone else in for him? It's hard to believe none of the other top teams were interested, especially at 24m.

741~~~
This is the best description yet, so accurate <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

742~~~
With his agility and technique I feel there is still a lot more to come from him on the ball. My one concern is we could run him into the ground given how much grass he has to cover with his CM partners in the double pivot not being the most athletic or quick at this stage of their careers.

743~~~
he is the type of a player that does his thing efficiently without much people realizing it. nothing fancy but solid all the way.

744~~~
Did really well yesterday with the exception of a few sloppy passes and losing the ball unecessarily in the middle. I'm sure he can cut that out of his game and improve even more.

745~~~
His close control is amazing. He balanced a ball on the line again when fighting a Club Brugge defender off. Like somebody said earlier, his passing is not his strength. However, I'm really starting to like Schneiderlin and I can see now that he's top club material.

746~~~
Mo 'Farah' Schneiderlin

747~~~
Tops the league of distance covered so far this season, unsurprisingly.

748~~~
Imagine him and Fletch <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/> (and Owen Hargreaves)

749~~~
We'd score feck all goals but by god we'd outrun the cnuts

750~~~
One or two sloppy passes but so had Carrick, apart that fantastic performance and so far the best one for us. His reading of the game is phenomenal, showed he is not only a hard tackler. Very underrated passer too. Also think he will score some goals and important for us like Fletch used to do. 70-meters midfielder, stronger and less technical/creative version of Herrera although I think he can carry the ball out of midfield/defense really well.

751~~~
He is performing just as i expected, but will get better with time. Have had him in my ideal United lineup for 3 years now. Just pumped that we actually signed him. Exactly what we needed in our midfield, an all action midfielder. Now if we can only incorporate Herrera and Schweinsteiger in to the same midfield, then i would be ecstatic.

752~~~
Obviously it's been a disappointing few days/weeks in the transfer window which has depressed a fair few of us, but taking a step back and looking at it objectively we've done well this window. Convincing me of that opinion not least is Schneiderlin, fecking delighted he's ours and I think he's gunna have a solid season. Settled in so quickly it genuinely feels like he's been here years.

753~~~
Don't forget Park <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

754~~~
Pretty much the perfect Van Gaal midfielder. I'd hope there's more to come in terms of ability on the ball though.

755~~~
Needs to improve his passing. Other than that he's been solid.

756~~~
Agree, I was delighted when we signed him. Had been a big fan for a couple of years now.

And I think he's been very good and a definite reason for why we have looked so solid. But as you say there's more to come from him on the ball, have full confidence we will see even better performances soon

757~~~
I think he's going to be one of our most important players for years to come. He's everything we've been missing for ages; once his awareness and passing is back up to what it was at Southampton then we'll have an absolute monster on our hands. Definitely a potential candidate for a future captain, I think.

758~~~
In what fashion? So far he's had 44/51, 51/59 and 81/90. Those are pretty consistent numbers for the type of role he is playing, I mean, yeah he could probably improve on those already extremely credible numbers.. But I think it would be harsh to point it out in this type of context. As if improving this would make him even more of one of our best players so far despite all of his other fantastic contributions.

759~~~
His spatial awareness when he receives the ball and gives it needs a bit of work. Also he'll sometimes underhit a pass or play it slightly askew of where it would best be played. Both those things will come with fitness and understanding of his teammates though. Very good player.

760~~~
Hes frustrating as feck on the ball, always takes like 4 touches before doing something

761~~~
He needs to be our real CDM, dont like him on the ball too much.

762~~~
I think his lack of awareness when his midfield partner's in possession is even worse. Always on his heels. Just not a forward thinking midfield player on any level so comparisons to Fletcher are well off the mark because of that alone.

763~~~
Before the ref whistled, why didn't he try to play it forward a lot quicker ? It drove me nuts.

764~~~
Defensively he's a beast, we just need the creativity next to him.  Unfortunately when you have a striker in Rooney that refuses to move it's quite difficult to stretch a defence and we end up passing it in front of Newcastle.

765~~~
Played well. Did his role.

766~~~
Too slow to move the ball on.

Especially frustrating in injury time.

767~~~
well - when we create roughly 30 half-chances - the opponents have like 2 - I don't Think the real issue is central midfield. The real issue is that Januzaj is horribly bad when he has an off-day, Depay showed today he is exactly the same - and Rooney is completely out of form. The other 8 players on our side did really well

768~~~
he can't be criticized for anything, for what he's on the pitch he's done really well, I think it's maybe a time to pair him with Herrera, Schneiderlin can sweep around defense and win the ball more at our half, Herrera can do the same on the opposition half while being more creative and finding spaces betweenmidfield and attack, this link up play we lacked the most today. 

Carrick has done brilliantly well when he came on but it's clear that that front four is too isolated.

In addition to Morgan, nice little flick to Shaw, he's not out of place technically at all, he doesn't get to those situations as he's job on the pitch is just something else.

769~~~
He does the defensive side very well but should keep it simpler on the ball and needs to move it quicker, but when we play him the CM partner and #10 need to take on full creative responsibility and just let him patrol.

770~~~
Solid needs a runner next to him.

771~~~
Should play 4-3-3 with him at the base, absolutely pointless having two glacial players next to him that don't want to run the ball ever. Basically he's playing as a defensive midfielder and a box to box player all in one. It is quite insane really. Head and shoulders our best signing and most important midfield player.

772~~~
Agree with most here. Did his job defensively but when he has the ball he needs to sharpen up a bit.

773~~~
Agree with you both there.

As a team player and for his role he did very well but individually, he does still deserve some criticism because he made quite a few poor passes in favourable situations (e.g when he had time, space or was not under pressure).

I don't think realistically any of our midfielders can play in a midfield two when playing against any half decent opposition that knows to be sit behind the ball and defend half decently. Januzaj today did individually ok to poor but his team role was poor. That's down to him and LVG's tactics imo. We simply can't have this '2nd' striker business with our current squad and need to play the ball faster.

774~~~
I think he is a huge reason in our 3 clean sheets, has given Blind and Smalling so much more protection. Doing well.

775~~~
He is great for what he is currently - a tough tackling DM - we need him to grow on the attacking side. When he has the ball and we are in possession he needs to do more with it.  Louis' master plan is that will be at least 70% of the time, so he needs to learn how to use it better - that doesn't necessarily mean defence splitting passes, but more off and on teh ball movement and 1-2's to move it forwards quickly.

776~~~
I think we're too defensive with him and either Carrick or Schweinsteiger. He's doing his DM role well but rarely gets forward. If that's the way it is then would like to see him with Herrera.

777~~~
I think I will just give him 6/10 every week

He does a good job back there but really does not help with in possession

778~~~
LVG needs to loosen up his ideas and take the shackles off him. Let him charge forward like he did in the second. That's what made a world of difference.

779~~~
You know that wont happen. He wants stability, control, posession and not a player charging forward and doing risky things, while keeping the midfield open.

780~~~
No he really doesn't. 

Schneirderlin is very good at what he's good at but I think its insane to use him for anything else. Why bother signing one of the best holding midfielders in the league and then try and play them in any other way?

The problem is his partner, Herrera's probably the more natural fit but Carrick and Schweinsteiger are better players. I thought he looked a lot better with Schweinsteiger until he picked up a knock and faded than he has with Carrick so far.

I would like o see Schneirderlin take less risks with his passing though and just quickly move the ball on to our more creative players.

781~~~
His job is to break up play, win possession, shield the defence and ensure we don't get overrun in midfield, he's doing it with excellence. I just feel he's a bit restricted [LVG, tactics], hence he doesn't go on those forward runs like he does at his previous club. He can really "play" if he's allowed to & move forward if he's allowed to. Fantastic signing.

782~~~
I never said play them any other way. But you can clearly see that he wants to come forward, and we did need that drive between the front line and midfield, we had nobody working the space till Carrick came on and started playing a double pivot with Schneiderlin and then we saw movement. I'm not saying use him as an offensive midfielder at all.

783~~~
I didn't think you did, but I disagree with using him as any other sort of midfielder other than a holding one.

784~~~
Have we ever had a player like This before?

I really do see his importance in how we have been set up. On the ball he has looked quite poor but work rate and how he protects the defence is generally excellent

It's like we have finally signed Jon Obi Mikel

785~~~
The problem is if we persist with a midfield duo and disallow either of them from engaging in box to box duties, we'll continue to suffer from that ridiculous gulf between midfield and the front line. With LVG's philosophy of hoarding possession, we already have Carrick to sit at the base of midfield and dictate play while screening the defence. It doesn't make sense to play another holding player beside him. It's far too cowardly and conservative. We need him and Carrick/Bastian and either Fellaini/Ander in a 3.

786~~~
Don't be silly. He shits all over Jon Obi Mikel.

787~~~
I've always though Mikel a decent player

Hopefully Morgan will be a better version. But I think it's a fair comparison.

788~~~
Come on Randall. Morgan's already a level above John as a DM.

789~~~
Perhaps the issues with him hanging on to ball too long are a result of him trying his best to follow van gaals approach.

790~~~
He can't charge forward when playing alongside Schweinsteiger because the German spends half the game in attacking positions, generally on the left wing. If Schneiderlin burst forward too we'd have no-one in centre mid with our defence sitting on the halfway line. We did that a lot last season with Blind pushing right up the pitch and Herrera going for a wander and we were left wide open in the middle. 

The reason he does it when Carrick's there is because he knows Carrick will sit back and defend when necessary. Schweinsteiger won't. That's why I find it a bit odd that people are saying Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin is too defensive...Schweinsteiger might not spend a lot of time in the opposition box but he's clearly an offensive-minded midfielder.

It's a weird comparison. The first that comes to mind with Schneiderlin is the last thing that comes to mind with Mikel - mobility.

791~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Mikel

792~~~
On his debut and throughout pre-season he was hitting cross field passes and playing some riskier passes. It wouldn't surprise me if he's been told just to break up play and then find the simple pass when he gets it.

793~~~
He will grow into being a player with us more and deal with the pressure better in time.

794~~~
John Obi Mikel <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

795~~~
Mikel. Seriously?

796~~~
He's already a better version. A much better version. They're not even similar in the way they play. Schneiderlin pops up all over the pitch, Mikel just strolls around in one small area. 

In answer to your question about have we ever had players like Schneiderlin before, yes, of course we have. Only they've been shit (Djemba Djemba) or made of glass (Hargreaves)

The stick he's been getting for his contribution when we're in possession is just absurd. He's played three fecking games. Passing the ball in the centre of the park is all about anticipating the movement of your team-mates because the best option is often behind you. So you can't expect someone to slot into that position and instantly look as though he's been there for years. The first few games were always going to be about showing off his defensive skills. Anyone who paid any attention to him at Southampton could see there's much more to his game than just being a destroyer. Feck it, there's been glimpses of it already in a United shirt. He'll express himself more and more as the season goes on and the Mikel comparison will be more and more absurd.

797~~~
<span style="color: inherit">Seriously?

I've always thought Mikel was stealing a living as a footballer. Just strolls around within a confined space. </span>

798~~~
Morgan gives energy and legs missing from Carrick and Bastian's game.

799~~~
He was very decent on the ball and at times highly creative at Southampton I just don't feel he has the freedom to do so at the minute.

800~~~
I feel the same way. I would prefer that Carrick or Schweinsteiger played behind him and dictate play and either of Schneiderlin or Herrera get the box to box role. We don't need two sitting CM's.

801~~~
Particularly at home against the weaker sides in the division.

802~~~
Schneiderlin and Herrera would rip oppenets open. Shame LVG doesn't see that.

803~~~
The Mikel of the last few seasons definitely yes but I think his first 3-4 seasons were very good at Chelsea.

804~~~
So as it seems we won`t get another attacking player this window I would like to see us playing 4-3-3 on a constant basis with Schneiderlin, Herrera and one of Schweini (rotated with Carrick only when not fully fit) behind Rooney/Mata/Memphis.
That midfield would present a solid mixture and also give some cover to Smalling and Blind.

Schneiderlin and Herrera should get a starting spot in most of the games.

805~~~
As much as I'd love to see Herrera start some games for us, it doesn't look like LVG fancies him in the current set up at the moment. As someone pointed out to me before, LVG prefers a second striker in the no. 10 role, which pretty much rules out anyone that isn't Januzaj, Memphis, or Fellaini. He seems to have abandoned the Memphis experiment for now, but it seems strange that Mata, our most natural no. 10 can't get a start in that position. Of course he isn't the quickest but it's not like we have been blowing teams away with lightning pace attacks this season. Januzaj isn't mature enough to start in such a key position as yet. As such, I wouldn't be opposed to starting herrera in that position instead of Januzaj and see how he does. He's not the most natural no. 10, but he's got a good eye for a pass and links up well with Mata, wouldn't be the worst idea in the world.

806~~~
Opinions are interesting. I had Morgan as our best player on Saturday, and thought he was excellent. Won 50 tackles as usual, and then in the second half I think he was very progressive and forward thinking too. He dropped a nice shoulder at one point and drove us forward through the middle, and got as far forward as the edge of the box and played a delightful back-heel in the one-two with Shaw before his (Shaw's) shot.

807~~~
Yes I agree, funny I was arguing with a friend who was telling me Morgan can't contribute in the final third, to which I said.... well you're basically a twat and haven't watched him very much <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

808~~~
Yea, based on what I saw second half on Saturday, I think he will grow even more in that department as he and the team become settled.

809~~~
He passes back too often for my liking. He doesn't see the space in front of him at times. I am sure that LVG will work on this with him.

810~~~
First half yes, it was Bastians job to pass forward. When Bastian went off, he stepped it up.

811~~~
Djemba was box to box and was signed for that reason

Sure Hargreaves was defensive mid but we got far better games out of him on the wing

I can't think of a Utd player who only ever was out and out defensive mid with no other role

Not sure why to Mikel comparison offends, as he has been every effective in that exact role over the years at Chelsea. The fact he is still at the club albeit in a far lesser role now, and gone through so many managers would certainly suggest he is no joke.

812~~~
Mikel's shit, I think this is first time I've ever seen him described as anything other than shite

813~~~
Over 200 games for Chelsea? And a bunch of medals? Don't  talk out your ass

814~~~
He did his job on Saturday. Some people need to understand that he's not a midfielder that's going to get forward and nick a goal and steal the headlights. Which is why he needs someone like Herrera next to him, not another DM.

815~~~
And Valencia can boost the same thing. It's a shaky basis to use to make your point.

816~~~
Valencia was outstanding for a few years and last season was fine. What's your point?

817~~~
Mikel's bang average. A journeyman who's useful to have in the squad but Schneiderlin's better. Like, really obviously better. 

Dunno what you've seen in Schneiderlin to decide he's a different type of midfielder to the Djemba twins. Surely you've seen - even in just three games - that he does a lot more than just sit in front of the back four. United games aside, did you never watch him for Southampton? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

818~~~
Last season he wasn't fine. He performed to a minimum level and somehow we find that an acceptable level. There's more to being a fullback than protecting a side and passing it back to the CB.

819~~~
I don't understand why everybody thinks Herrera is an instant fix. He played deeper lots of times last season and struggled badly for the most part despite showing some nice touches. It was only when he was moved further forward that he started really playing well.

Don't get me wrong, I think he is class, but he is competing for one of the 3 positions occupied on Saturday by Mata, Depay and Janujaz

820~~~
Well Valencia's got PFA Team of the Year on his cv. Unlike Mikel, who never even came close to being such an influential player. So there's that.

821~~~
Valencia was literally our player of the season once. Come on, give him some credit.

822~~~
Call Batman,things getting out of control.

823~~~
He's doing great so far. Yes, I feel more comfortable seeing Schweinsteiger/Carrick on the ball but he's also not a pure destroyer. People these days demand players to be perfect at everything, the same with center backs where fans expect them to score headers, defend brilliant, show playmaker abilities like Beckenbauer and at the same time have the pace of Walcott.
Schneiderlin is doing exactly what is asked of him - protect the defence. The problem in our transition game is not down to his lack in creativity but more because the whole attack bar Mata shows absolutely no desire to work for their involvement. Januzay and Depay seem just to hang around the attack/the wings waiting for the ball to come to them and Rooney, well we've all seen his form in the past weeks. Mata, especially against Newcastle, seemed to be the only one whos dropping deeper occasionally to get involved. It says a lot when both full backs have been the best players so far this season, simply because they actually make themselves available for our CDMs with their constant forward runs. That is why I actually think an inclusion of Herrera (although I don't think he's the wonder solution for everything like some seem to think) and a 433 with Schneiderlin-Schweinsteiger/Carrick-Herrera and Depay-Rooney-Mata upfront would be the best right now. Schweinsteiger/Carrick as the deep lying playmakers, Schneiderlin to protect the defence and Herrera in an advanced role to close the gap to the attackers. With Mata dropping deeper from time to time and Depay&Rooney sticking upfront that would be the best system for the players we have right now I'd say.

824~~~
I regret mentioning Mikel

It wasn't meant as an insult, I was simply referring to the fact we really have never had an out and out defensive mid. Mikel nearly was ours hence the reason why I said we got him at last.

I do like Morgan and think he will be important but as I also said I can see him being very much a 6/10 player. I seen him plenty for Southampton as well, and I really don't see him being much use in the attacking third

Those calling for Herrera to be involved with bastian and Morgan might be onto something

825~~~
Mikel was a central attacking midfielder when we nearly had him right?

826~~~
So, who's heading down to the Adidas store at lunchtime while Morgan's off to Belgium?

827~~~
24/87 passes attempted against Newcastle were backwards, I have no idea how this is a criticism to be honest. In truth, I am actually finding it strange to see people popping up and criticising his passing (in various threads). It has been what you would expect from a defensive midfielder. He's completing at about 88%.

828~~~
I have seen him on numerous occasions this season passing back as soon as he receives the ball instead of appreciating the space in front of him. Your stat does nothing to disprove that.

829~~~
Worth mentioning it this is valid for all our players not just Morgan.

The other noticible thing (esp with Bastian) is that there seems to be some invisible line that the midfielders should not cross. In several situations he runs forward and goes full stop and back.

830~~~
You'd think that WAGs wouldn't need to work anywhere, much less a sports store.

831~~~
That was what the story was about in whatever paper I read it in. She's not even earning enough to cover her hotel room at the Lowrey (as if she were paying it anyway) I think it's really good that she wants to work and earn her own money.

832~~~
What?! She used to be on the French version of Survivor <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

833~~~
According to the Mirror he wanted the no.8 shirt when he signed, Juan said he could have it providing he got the no.10 shirt which Rooney obviously refused. The more you know.

834~~~
Rooney has no business keeping the no. 10 shirt considering the way he's been playing.

<span style="color: #ffffff">white text</span>

835~~~
He should just wait and take 16 when Carrick retires.

836~~~
I really doubt this story. For one Morgan would be given a list of numbers he could choose from and plus I really doubt that Mata would ask the club to give him Rooney s number while Rooney is still in the team.

These were the links re his girlfriend others are discussing above. United should probably give her a job to keep her happy just in case for the future.

838~~~
His absence made a massive difference, we looked exposed at the back throughout the first half and shades of last season where defenders/keeper are put under immense pressure. 

Can't overstate enough the difference this bloke has made so far, specially at the back. Absolute beast.

839~~~
Most important player in our side. Scary to think that he'll get better.

840~~~
Agreed, Brugge were running through us at times and it showed how vital a part of our improved defense he is.

841~~~
Interesting decision to rest him and give Herrera a match as a holding midfielder.

It shows that LVG isn't worried about Schneiderlin's readiness, whereas Carrick, Schweinstiger and Herrera need matches.

I look forward to seeing him against Swansea.

842~~~
Why can't we give her a job at the Mega Store - she wears the United top really well. As you said keep her happy so she doesn't do what DDG's thingy is doing.

843~~~
Glad he got a rest tonight. Been a beast so far.

844~~~
We missed him in the first half. The ball bypassed our midfield zone very easily

845~~~
He presses the opposition like an absolute madman, it's no surprise that Brugge found openings in our midfield and defense tonight at times. 

Looking forward to seeing him play again on Sunday.

846~~~
For me he is the one midfielder who should always start. Hes strong and can bring the ball forward, none of our other midfielders can do that at least not as good.

847~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

848~~~
What they said.

I couldn't give a shite if people think he's negative in possession (I don't even think he is), he absolutely must start every game. Apart from dead rubbers/easy cup ties of course.

849~~~
Same with Southampton this season, far too open in midfield, although Clasie is still out. Defensively he is just a monster, no doubt. Needs to improve his awareness and on the ball ability. Still a starter for me, his presence, engine and pressing are top notch and miles ahead of everyone else in our team.

850~~~
Good interview with him in the Irish Examiner today. I like his attitude a lot. He comes across as confident with a touch of the right kind of French arrogance, but also real desire to achieve and the willingness to work hard to get there. He's going to be a smashing player for us.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/soccer/morgan-schneiderlin-looks-to-emulate-legend-roy-keane-350482.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/...looks-to-emulate-legend-roy-keane-350482.html</a>

851~~~
I said it in the Newcastle game thread that we needed to start rotating now and I'm absolutely glad LVG has done that. With the quality and depth in our squad, LVG has no excuses really but anyways I'll just drop what I wrote there:

852~~~
Still going around doing his upmost to get 6/10 and remain unnoticed

853~~~
I thought he had a shocking game. Booked for stupid challenge then at fault for their first goal when he let Ayew run off him. Needs to pay more attention when the opposition are counter-attacking. He was stood next to Ayew as the move developed then by the time the cross came in, Ayew was totally free.

854~~~
He is a cdm. 

What do you want him to do? Roulettes? Shots from 30 yards.

855~~~
I felt when he came off we looked more vulnerable to the run centrally.

856~~~
He just isn't a player I'm used to seeing at Utd

857~~~
Thats something most players make mistakes, ball watching, instead of tracking the runner.

858~~~
Do agree really. Rather unremarkable when compared to Carricks holding role of the past few years

859~~~
I expect him to pick up his runners, which he failed to do on Ayew for his goal and just a couple of minutes after for Gomis when he got in behind in acres of space, just a couple of minutes before his goal. Hence why he was subbed off.

860~~~
He didn't have his best game ever today but he will be an extremely valuable player for us for years to come.

861~~~
Not really.

They scored their first goal because Shaw got caught up the pitch, because Rooney gave the ball away stupidly. The defence didn't step across to cover him, and Schweinsteiger got caught in no mans land.

862~~~
How was Carrick in his first few years with us? People were saying the same shit that he's no Keane. We need to sign a new Keane.

863~~~
I thought the team bypassed him even when playing the ball to him was the right move. He's not Pirlo out there but he has to have the confidence of his teammates and want the ball.

864~~~
When on the ball, he doesn't do enough. He needs to impose himself much more and offer more going forward but that will come

865~~~
One thing that is overlooked is that he's doing the running for 2 in there, at Southampton the workload was shared with Wanyama. Fletcher used to do the same when playing with latter day Scholes.

866~~~
He's arguably our most important player for us at the moment, without him we won't be able to control games as effectively as LVG requires.

867~~~
I think he's very overrated. I'm delighted we have him and he should start a lot of games but the idea he's been our best midfielder is ludicrous, IMO. He's not in the same class as the other two. 

The idea that more tackles = better defensively was surely shot to pieces today too. Schneiderlin made as many tackles today in 20 minutes as Carrick made in 70 but it was abundantly clear that we were much more secure defensively with Carrick in there.

868~~~
I agree with this.

His awareness when we're in possession on the ball and off the ball are poor. Schweinsteiger-Carrick together defensively are easily good enough.

869~~~
I said it weeks ago, he needs to be better on the ball but that will come. Off the ball he does a very good job

870~~~
They are different players. Just like Blind and Smalling. Morgan is the muscle and basti and Carrick are the brains. In games vs arsenal or Chelsea he is absolutely vital to deal with their pace and strength

871~~~
I agree he's not (yet?) in the same class as Carrick and Schweini, but that's hardly a damning judgment, not many players are. He may or may not elevate his game, but what he currently offers is different to the other two and is really useful for us.

872~~~
He's here as a translator for Martial, nothing more

<span style="color: #ffffff">hehe</span>

873~~~
His passing in some aspects needs improving but who better to learn those traits off, than Carrick and Schweinsteiger. He'll be a great player for us this season, few more games in his stride and he'll be even better.

874~~~
And I think that's very harsh. When we bought him, nobody was expecting signing one of the best central midfielders in Europe. We brought in a very useful player, who's consistent and offers something different to our other midfielders, which can be just as important. 

Recently, it seems that people are expecting players, who just signed for us, to immediately be as good as van Persie was in his first season for us. Signing for us and coming from Southampton was always going to be a step-up and so far he's been more than good enough and he'll probably improve, since he's done that all his career.

875~~~
We bought him for the job he's best at and that's cleaning up the lost balls in midfield & energy, its not glorious but by no means did they club think they were getting Iniesta. I think he's be fine any game he's played he is also young and after coming to a new club, give him time. As for people calling him out on his passing that's fair enough, it has been off but trust me this guy can pass as good as Carrick.

876~~~
I'm not saying he's been supbar or that he was overrated when he joined. Not at all. I just think his early season performances have been overrated, partly because people are very generous with their praise of new signings and partly because he brings something different to the table.

Schneiderlin's all action style is new and fresh and more in line with English perceptions of the ideal defensive midfielder and as a result Carrick's quiet dominance that we've become all too used to doesn't get the appreciation it warrants. Schneiderlin received widespread praise in August while Carrick barely got a mention but compare their performances side by side, objectively, and it becomes clear the perceptions and performances are very far apart IMO.

877~~~
I don't think he's been overrated at all, for all of Carrick's positional qualities we were susceptible to the run when up against fast and powerful midfields since Fletcher took ill, Schneiderlin has cut that avenue off for opposition teams, today Schweini did with a grass covering performance I honestly didn't think he still had in his legs.

Anyway, today Morgan did a bit of translating and a solid bit of closing time bulldog work.

878~~~
If you mean on the same consistent level as Carrick i really disagree, he is nowhere near, but Carrick is one of the best passers in the game.

879~~~
I wasn't talking about passing consistency, I said he <b>can </b>pass as good as Carrick, thought that was self explanatory.

880~~~
And Ronaldo was a translator for Anderson.

881~~~
I get it, sorry then mate <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Schneiderlin doesn't dictate a game like Carrick or Schweini, he is more in the mould of Van Bommel and Sven Bender type of player. To get the most out of him, i think we should look for a more mobile version of Carrick like Gundogan to partner him, WHO can do the job of getting forward. He will probably never be an attacking force, but he is a class player and the job of cleaning up in the middle is not an easy job. He has more in his locker than he has showed so far for us though, just needs to settle in and then we will get to see what he can do.

882~~~
I assumed he'd be a little less mobile and physical than he seemed when he was so good against Chelsea, but that his passing and technique would be a pleasant surprise. Instead, he's better at his strengths than I figured and worse at his weaknesses.

I doubt it will be under Van Gaal, but does anyone else think he's got everything you need to be a great CB? Strong, quick, physical and can play a long pass. Not sure about his reading of the game or how long it would take him to adjust but that's where he would play for Barca or Bayern and I think he'd be pretty damn good in that kind of role.

883~~~
Nail on head for me. Hope he can improve his passing, but it's hardly a given,

884~~~
Carrick has been a lot better than him so far.

885~~~
This season? I've not even seen his second half in the Liverpool match but Schneiderlin has been worlds ahead of Carrick/BFS this season.

886~~~
Yeah this season. I think a midfield two of Carrick and Schwein is a lot better than having Schneiderlin in there. 

Carrick has a lot more quality about him.

887~~~
That doesn't discount Carrick from being pretty dire at the start of the season and BFS having obvious fitness struggles. The protection of the back four that MS gives goes unnoticed because there is no real way to quantify it with something tangible.

888~~~
Schweinsteigher and Carrick's best performances this season have been streets ahead of Schneiderlin imo. Early days but he needs to learn how to pass better. Not sure if he has that in his locker though

889~~~
There is, with tackles and interceptions and in the opening 3 games Schneiderlin was our or one of our best in those departments so he is having a very quiet but important effect on stability in the side, more so than Carrick so far IMHO.

890~~~
Fair enough, we disagree. He's not there to pass incredibly well and he hasn't passed badly at all in any case. I did see after one of the Brugge games people really got stuck into him about how terrible his passing is when he had about 3 or 4 bad passes and he had an accuracy of 90% which I thought was really reaching and uncalled for, maybe it is the same here? Maybe not.

In any case, I'm happy to agree to disagree.

891~~~
He lacks the football brain of the other two I think. Ability wise Carrick and Schweinsteiger are still far ahead of Schneiderlin and I think there's lots of room for improvement for him.

Also if he's going to be playing in a midfield 2 for us then well he should learn to pass well and not freeze in the final third.

892~~~
Grant it it's only a few games into the season but Carrick has been our worst midfielder up until today.

893~~~
Carrick was really good when he come on against Newcastle. Direct forward passing with a purpose

894~~~
Midfield options <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

Plus hes a different type of midfielder than what weve got or had for a while which is a plus. I think it was the right decision not to start him today but to bring him on when we did.

895~~~
Should start v PSV. Did well when he came on.

896~~~
To be fair this was a really tame Liverpool midfield. Schweinsteiger and Carrick both played very well but don't expect them to be able to consistently dominate against your Crystal Palaces, West Hams, Evertons etc. There was not much intensity, composure and/or fight in that Liverpool midfield (which extended to their forward play too).

Schneiderlin will have to learn to be more disciplined and positionally aware (as does Herrera at times) but he's got some great team mates to learn from.

897~~~
This is the big thing, Carrick could run matches like yesterday without Schweinsteiger or Schneiderlin. The problem has always been with the high tempo physical mid-fields like Everton, Crystal Palace etc. Those are the matches Schneiderlin will be needed because Schweinsteiger isn't going to solve it. When teams sit off, and allow us to play a slow game then there is no need for Schneiderlin but most teams don't allow that.

898~~~
I personally think Schneiderlin is better as a 4, being behind 2 more advanced CM's would suit him best, but he is very good in a 2 as well. The only time he struggles I find is when a team is sitting back deeper, he hasn't got much experience with unlocking defences like that. When he came on though he added great energy and steely tackling. It's nice to have Carrick/Schweinsteiger/Schneiderlin all at a high level, they all seem to work well together it doesn't matter which 1 starts which is great for rotation.

899~~~
I'm not sure about that. Maybe in the past but not the Carrick of today. Carrick certainly played very well but he had Schweinsteiger, who was essentially doing the running for both of them. 

Against PSV, who I believe were a very counter attacking team last season (but obviously they've lost big big players in Depay and Wijnaldum) I'd expect Schneiderlin to start. Maybe give Schweinsteiger a rest after what 3 consecutive 90+ min games now?

900~~~
Can we get Scholes to tutor him please ?

901~~~
Should of came on today for Mata who was struggling and pushed Herrera forward. Against teams who are just going to sit and try to get us on the counter Morgan should always play.

902~~~
He should play frequently. We need his tenacity and industry through the middle seeing as we are only conceding goals on the counter late in matches. By this point Basti and Carrick seem knackered.

903~~~
I know we have quality now in midfield(I love saying that) but I feel Schneiderlin has been fantastic with the job his done. Before we bought him he wasn't known for his passing so I don't get why its expected of him now? Is that the reason his been dropped??

904~~~
No idea why he hasn't been playing, it makes no sense to not play the one young energetic proper defensive DM that we have regularly.

905~~~
Van Gaal.  Your manager makes strange decisions.

906~~~
It'd be interesting to hear LVG's reasoning behind dropping him. I'm not having a pop at LVG or anything, it would just be genuinely interesting.

907~~~
Doubt he's going to say much. Doubt he's even going to be asked. He has been guilty of giving away the ball cheaply. That might be a reason.

908~~~
We finally have some great midfield options for rotation.

We cant play Carrick, BFS, Schneiderman & Hererra every game especially if Mata takes the #10 spot.

Unfortunately for Schneiderman, Hererra has been performing at a higher level in an attacking sense, and defensively LVG seems to trust Carrick & BFS more.

909~~~
We look so much more secure at the back with Schneiderlin in front of them. He is one of the best tacklers I have ever seen, but can also pass well enough for a DM and has the energy to go from one box to another. 

I'd play him as the deepest MF with BFS just in front of him.

910~~~
No idea why he hasn't been playing? 3 doesn't go into 2.

If we dropped Carrick, it would be why isn't Carrick playing, if we drop Schweinsteiger, it would be why isn't he playing. Now it's Schneiderlin. Can't play all 3 at once. I think he has been very good and want to see him play as much as possible but it's a long season and he will feature regularly.

911~~~
Martial wishes he was as good as Anderson

912~~~
I expect him to start against Southampton.

913~~~
LvG rightly expected that Liverpool will field a defensive lineup whereby it made no sense to field Schneiderlin. Without defensive work, we could rather play 2 pass masters not that good at tackles than a tackler without passing abilities.

PSV is a team where LvG has never won as a manager according to him so I reckon he went all out attacking so that he can win there once before his retirement. Mistake maybe but understandable. Fully think LvG rates him very highly and he has done the exact job he was bought for. The fact that we play with 2 shows LvG was aware of his passing weaknesses.

914~~~
Schneiderlin closes down pretty high up the pitch, that is his game. 

He will never play as the deepest midfielder under LVG.

915~~~
I think he is being trained to learn LVG's philosophy and that's why has he has featured much less. To be fair he has seemed a little out of touch with other team members in the last few games and maybe this is being ironed out. I have no doubts that he would have a good season though, similar to Herrera last season. 

I actually wish that LVG takes Darmian out of the firing line a bit too, he has been going downhill a bit steadily. No harm in playing Valencia for a couple of matches IMO.

916~~~
He was quietly good today, I just feel he needs to release the ball quicker at times but no complains otherwise, very solid against a good midfield.

917~~~
Yeah, he's been very solid for us. Another good performance.

918~~~
Looked a bit sloppy to start but he did well from then.

919~~~
Played his way into the game and I think helped Smalling out as almost an extra CB as we got our footing in the game.

920~~~
He was excellent today, we suffered in these kind of games last year. Solid signing and address what we exactly needed. LvG has a specialist now as he puts it.

921~~~
Started poorly but grew into the game. A 6/10 performance.

922~~~
Adds a level of physicality and solidity to the side, but doesn't appear to work well with Carrick at all. I feel their roles are almost the wrong way around at times (when together that is). Both play so much better when it's one or the other with Schweinsteiger.

923~~~
As someone said a few weeks back. Minister of Pressing.

924~~~
6/10

925~~~
Put him next to BFS or Herrera and he looks better.

926~~~
He will still be 6/10

927~~~
He's a holding midfielder. 

What do you want him to do? His job is to win the ball, press and pass to the better players around him.

928~~~
I know

I'm not fair, but this type of player takes some getting used to for me. 

He is and will forever be 6/10

929~~~
<img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

930~~~
I agree. Schneiderlin and Carrick seem to operate in very similar positions on the pitch, despite having different jobs, but it creates a big gap between midfield and attack and makes it difficult to play through the middle. Schweinsteiger plays a more advanced game and will go forward more than the other two. We look better when it's Schweinsteiger **

931~~~
Off the ball he is good but when he has it he's not offering enough

932~~~
Not disagreeing, but he's a pure DM and he's not really supposed to offer that much on the ball.

933~~~
I really like Schneiderlin. We need to put a better defense behind him.

934~~~
I thought that he was quite good on the ball at Southampton but for some reason hasn't shown that at United yet. He always plays it safe and backwards (not the only one in our team) but I know there's more to his game

935~~~
Aye, I'm guessing it's part down to instructions and part due to feeling his way into the team.

936~~~
I like him a lot. He does what he needs to do and he does it really well.

937~~~
That is very likely as our general play is so cautious that we can't build up pressure or attack when the other team is not yet organized

938~~~
That's just not true, if you have seen him for Southampton. He's no Carrick, but he can definitely play better in possession.

I agree with that.

939~~~
He seemed a little sluggish and mentally slow in the first half. He seemed too slow in passing the ball and was playing way too slow even when there were options further up the pitch. He improved a lot defensively in the second half and at least looked to drive forward with the ball a couple of times.

940~~~
Been solid without being spectacular for us so far.

941~~~
And sometimes that's all you need.

942~~~
True. Definitely think he's got a lot more to offer us though. Certainly looked decent so far. Perhaps isn't helping that we're rotating the three midfielders around a lot, although that's unlikely to change with Schweinsteiger/Carrick since they'll both need rested a lot. Schneiderlin will probably benefit as he gradually gets more and more used to playing alongside the two of them, though.

943~~~
I was expecting better. Not sure I agree with the 'he's a DM you can't expect good passing from him' as Carrick did the DM role for years while being a good passer. The people who said they would rather have Schneiderlin over Schweinsteiger in the summer are a little crazy!

944~~~
People were saying the same about Carrick at the start because he didn't play like Keane.

945~~~
Nah, I'm pretty confident that Schneiderlin will become a far more important player for United than Schweinsteiger. 

People need to remember that Schneiderlin has never played in this type of environment before, where every single thing you do is critiqued by both fans and journalists. I think he has handled it very well so far, but there's so much more to come from him.

946~~~
Thought he was very good. Played a very important role and is settling in nicely.

947~~~
I don't think him and Carrick are a particularly good partnership in all honesty. They're both quite similar players, albeit at different stages of their career, but we do lack attacking momentum from the middle with those two. I think it should be one of Carrick/Morgan partnered with one of Basti/Herrera. That, or play 3 of the 4.

948~~~
I thought he was pretty good to be honest. He made some good interceptions and tackles. He doesn't look as good with Carrick though.

949~~~
Nightmarish performance in the first 20 minutes but grew stronger. Was everywhere and was quite immense in defense. He is going to be really big for us.

950~~~
He's the only proper number 6 we have out of our 10 outfield players on the pitch?

951~~~
He is good, but I still think Carrick-Schweinsteiger is our best partnership.

952~~~
He was pretty good but he can still be a bit sloppy in possession. Hoping he improves his work on the ball as the season goes on because he shows glimpses of it every now and then. Because if he's going to just be a defensive screen then he needs to absolutely incredible at it ala Makelele.

953~~~
He was made to look worse yesterday because Carrick played like a coward. I don't think they're similar players at all unless Carrick goes into his shell. On form Carrick makes things tick for us in a way Schneiderlin never will. He just didn't do that at all yesterday.

954~~~
He's better with the ball than he has shown. He isn't a Tiote as some would like you to believe. Our system takes time getting used to, I'm absolutely sure he'll get better with the ball.

955~~~
This is what I'm hoping for. I have to say I was never enamoured with the signing and certainly didn't agree with the belief on here that he would be our best signing this Summer. I'm just looking for him to be a bit more positive in possession. There have been a fair few examples so far this season where he could turn and run forward into the space for 20-30 yards and has instead chosen the safe sideways pass. In actual fact the responsibility of bringing the ball out of defence has fallen to Blind and Smalling, which naturally leaves a hole at the back. 

I'm sure he'll improve, I'm just not sure he'll ever be more than good - more of a steady but unspectacular player.

956~~~
He's never going to be running 20 30 ards with the ball or become a spectacular passer. He is definitely better than what he has shown though. I think the onus of creating things will always be on the one playing next to him and our attackers who drop deep. He's there to let them flourish but isn't as useless as a Tiote.

957~~~
I don't think anyone was expecting a spectacular passer, but I think we're fully entitled to expect him to carry the ball 10, 20 or 30 yards out of defence and then distribute it to our attacking players. This is part of the reason he was so good for So'ton, he wouldn't just stifle opposition attacks and press/tackle/intercept. He would relieve pressure by carrying the ball forwards. Someone posted a video of him against Man City when we signed him where he was often moving past Toure into the space in behind which opened up space in their midfield.

This is what I'd like to see more of, I'm not suggesting he turn into a 25 year old Paul Scholes, just that he carry the ball a bit further when the opportunity presents itself. Hopefully this is just a confidence thing, whereby he doesn't want to make any costly mistakes so early into his career here.

958~~~
He seems to fit the system well enough. I'd like to see him venture further forward in the way Toure does but guess that goes against the 'philosophy'. I think there is more to come but don't expect high energy runs and careering into the penalty box. He's the water carrier and lets face it every successful team seems to have one. I think he's there as much as anything to compete with Carrick and ultimately dethrone him. This season will be a bedding in one for him and perhaps it will be a year or so until we see the very best of him.

959~~~
I don't think it's something he's incapable of but our CMs aren't really encouraged to run with the ball. Especially given he plays as the deepest CM, I don't see him doing it. Ofcourse, if a chance for a quick counter comes up and he has the ball, he'll do it but those are rare.

960~~~
When have you seen any player, let alone midfielder in our team carry the ball 10/20/30 yards out of defence and distribute it to our attack? That is an absolutely absurd expectation. Carrick and BFS don't even do that on a regular basis. In fact, barely anybody bar Smalling has really done it this season.

961~~~
I'm not sure why Blind/Smalling would be encouraged to bring the ball out from deep over our central midfielder.

962~~~
He's so much better without Carrick (and vica-versa), because he knows that he is the main person to sit/do the defensive work in that midfield. 

I feel like both him and Carrick want to be the deepest midfielder, and want to be the person that breaks up the attacks... but when they're both on the pitch together, it's almost as if they're too polite with each other - constantly defering to one another to sort things out and trying not to get in each others way.

That's the feeling I get anyway.

963~~~
I don't think I've ever seen anyone work well with Carrick bar Scholes. Mainly because Scholes fundamentals with the ball were out of this world and his ability to pass and orchestrate out of trouble was second to none.

964~~~
Herrera works pretty well with Carrick. Schweinsteiger did in the Liverpool game too.

965~~~
Over an extended period of time. Fair play, those two maybe not as well as Scholes. <img alt=":D" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie5" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Big Grin    :D"/>

966~~~
Great run by McNair yesterday. I know our midfielders don't tend to make lung busting runs beyond the front three into the box but I can't remember the last time, if ever, that I saw two of our central defenders beat two or three players and find themselves with just the keeper to beat as McNair did yesterday and Smalling did against PSV on Tuesday.

967~~~
Maybe also Fletcher (when he was good)?

Carrick has had to play with a bit of a revolving door of CM's though (or, sometimes, no CM's) to be fair to him!

968~~~
Maybe my criticism should have been stated as his failure to effectively build play up from deep, rather than specifically carrying the ball out of defence. Smalling/Blind carry the ball 20-30 yards from deep in this way, whereas Schweinsteiger will often play 1-2's, move into space and receive the ball to move our play forward, Carrick on the other hand will play a 20-30 yard forward pass to build play. From what I've seen thus far Schneiderlin tends to give this responsibility to those close by, whether it be his midfield partners, or the defenders/full backs. 

Personally I think the role of the deepest midfielder is as much to do with what you do when you have the ball, as it is what you do when the opposition has the ball. Again I assume this is lacking because he doesn't want to make any costly mistakes so early into his Unite career, hopefully as his confidence improves so will the levels of responsibility he assumes.

969~~~
I read that as revoltingly dour. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

970~~~
He's definitely capable of more, it's like a lot of people didn't watch him at Southampton, he can drive forward & he CAN play. Maybe he's been told to keep it simple or maybe he's taking his time to get used to things in a different & bigger club. The notion that he's poor on the ball is wrong overall, but I agree he hasn't shown it at United, so far.

971~~~
He needs to be the one to go forward if partnered with Carrick. Overall he had a decent game and was unlucky not to score from that corner routine.

972~~~
He was shit until Bastian came on, then he was really good, some fantastic tackles and very good pressing. 

What I don't like is that he is afraid to make long passes, his average pass length must have been something like 5m yesterday. Probably got the hairdryer from LVG because he's poor in possession and now he always picks the easy pass.

973~~~
Its very obvious that Schniderlin and Carrick don't work together.  Too square, no depth to the midfield and both do the same job.

One or the other with Basti from now on hopefully.

974~~~
I wish we played him as the sitting defensive midfielder with no offensive tasks. Then we could pair him with Herrera and Schweinsteiger on the right and left respectively. It might be the best midfield in the league, very well balanced. 

Not a fan of Carrick - Schneiderlin duo, I believe lvg made a mistake to play BfS in the relatively easy CL tie where it was quite obvious Carrick will struggle under Southampton pressure.

975~~~
His average pass length was 17m, 1 less than Carrick and 1 more than Schweinsteiger and he also had 95% completion. Why would he get the hairdryer for keeping possession, exactly what van Gaal wants from a defensive midfielder. He isn't supposed to take risks and lose the ball, he keeps possession and gets the ball to those around him who are tasked with taking the risks. He'd be getting the hairdryer if he was sending constant long balls and losing possession but he doesn't.

976~~~
It would be nice if he was more adventurous with his passing, but then again that is not why I wanted him in the team. He's doing good enough for me, he has to adapt to a completely different system to Southampton.

977~~~
Spot on. Know your job and do it well is probably the message from lvg.

978~~~
Have you seen any of our CMs run 20 30 yards with the ball? Blind and Smalling also bring it just to the halfway line when the ball comes to them with most of the team pushed high up in the opposition half.

979~~~
Yes, quite regularly. Every game you'll see either Blind or Smalling running 20-30 yards into the space in front of them. The latter particularly.

980~~~
CMs finneh.

981~~~
Apologies, not directly but my previous post already addressed that:

982~~~
Oh good. I agree with all of that. He can definitely contribute better with the ball and he will with time. The reason you mentioned and the fact that our style takes a bit of getting used to are the 2 factors imo. Carrick uses his excellent passing range know I g he won't lose the ball while BFS can do both. Schneiderlin I believe doesn't have the appetite to play a 30 yard ball now as he doesn't want to make mistakes. It will come though. He's better than this.

983~~~
Agreed and to be honest the reason I initially mentioned running into space is because that's what I expected after seeing him at So'ton. It was never his great passing range that effectively built from the back, it was his athleticism bringing the ball forward before playing a more simple pass to one of the attacking players. He is never going to have the passing range or Bastian or Carrick, but he has great stamina and power to build from the back in this way. As mentioned before his performance last season against City was him at his absolute best: 100% shutting Toure down offensively, whilst also taking the ball past him, forcing Toure far deeper than he wanted to be.

984~~~
Unfortunately, I don't expect to see much of that. Even Herrera doesn't run with the ball. Clear instructions really so hopefully he develops more confidence in his passing or the ability to pass his way forward via 1-2s.

985~~~
Should be nice and rested for the weekend.

With all over our new signings, he's the one I probably look forward to the most still - which is saying something because he is not a "flashy" player. He is an effective "behind the scenes" type of player and that's what I love, especially since our midfield was crying out for that sort of player for years. As one poster said earlier in the season, he is the master of the press; you couldn't describe him any better.

He'll be causing plenty of problems for Sunderland come Saturday.

986~~~
Much better in the second half. He got himself forward more. 

Made plenty of good tackles. Clean sheet.

987~~~
Needs to gain a bit more confidence with his passing and him and Carrick don't work as a partnership, but he was decent in the last 30 minutes.

988~~~
Pretty much an expected Morgan Schneiderlin performance, all things considering. Solid game from him.

989~~~
I thought he was very good today, probably his best game for us.

990~~~
He's a different player without Carrick. A lot more positive.

991~~~
He looked much better when Schweinsteiger came on. Carrick - Schneiderlin simply does not work, especially when playing Sunderland at home who did nothing more than park the bus.

992~~~
Indeed, too negative having two DMs against Sunderland. Schweinsteiger has looked class, needs to start with him.

993~~~
Grew into the game. Very good second half. Looked more like last season's Schneiderlin in the last half hour, drove forward a few times which we've not seen him do for us yet. He's got decent pace, and is quick on the turn so hopefully we'll see more of that. HE had the ball right on the edge of the box late on. He tried to play someone through, but he should have just smashed it.

Very solid outing though. Rarely puts a foot wrong, and makes it almost impossible to play through the middle of us.

994~~~
Rubbish first half. Good second half.

995~~~
Rubbish? <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

996~~~
I like him, just needs to sort have more confidence in his passing.

997~~~
Another good signing. Will develop more and more and become a top player for us.

998~~~
Yup.

999~~~
Carrick plays too far back to be compatable with him, they get in each others way.

1000~~~
Yep, had so much of the ball and did very little with it. Everyone around me was getting very frustrated with him... Particularly his stark refusal to cross the half way line!

1001~~~
Still think hes arguably our most important signing. Leaves the flashy stuff to others, and concentrates on his job of stopping the opposition going at our centre backs.

No coincidence our defence is now rock solid and Southampton's has fallen apart.

1002~~~
I actually thought today was the first time they actually had quite a bit of space between them. Carrick was pushing quite high up the pitch, particularly in the first half, and left it to Morgan to dictate the tempo a bit more... Which he did a poor job off

1003~~~
His best game for us so far imo.

His passing still leaves a lot to be desired, but his defensive work is great.

1004~~~
I only watched the second half, but thought he looked like our best player out there. Proper box-to-box midfielder, he will become great for us.

1005~~~
He was much better in the 2nd half than 1st half. The entire team played better in the 2nd half.

1006~~~
It's that and also because Carrick has a serial lack of movement. Carrick is too happy to sit, even in games like today against Sunderland. Schneiderlin is a very good defensive player but I don't think he's 'naturally' defensive minded i.e right now he's doing what's been asked of him and being disciplined. Schneiderlin wants to press, attack the opposition with tackles and with passing; he's like a more defensive version of Herrera but more physical.

Come to think of it, in games where we need some speed on the ball, during the game and more movement from our central midfielders, who can actually play 'well' with Carrick (as a long term solution because surely we can't rotate them to suit the opposition all the time)?

1007~~~
His lack of bombing forward surely can be somehow justified by Depay's reluctance to track back, somebody actually has to cover it.

1008~~~
Mata too, its why he is in the side and why we are conceding so few goals. He isn't in the side to bomb forward, even though he can, because if he does we'll be heavily exposed at the back. He is there to cover the defence because the front four except for Rooney sure as hell aren't going to do it.

1009~~~
He seemed to take charge a bit more today I thought. Still not overly ambitious but he seemed to be getting to ball first a lot more and directing more of the play which was nice to see.

A good player helping us to be better.

1010~~~
Thought he had a fantastic second half. Seemed to take more responsibility and looked more comfortable on the ball.

1011~~~
Poor first half. Much better 2nd. 

I haven't seen a United midfielder get ignored by his teammates in possession this much since O'Shea was playing there. 

I think his passing will improve (I don't think it was this mediocre for Southampton) but it's pretty poor at the moment. He's athletic enough to make decent runs off the ball but he's sitting deeper and if that's the case, he needs to move the ball better. The top teams in Europe don't have such a limited ballplayer in their first choice midfield like that anymore. Not just Barca, Bayern, Real, but even Atletico, Dortmund, Chelsea or Citeh.

He'll be more useful in tougher games, obviously, and it's early for him after so many years at a smaller club, but I am starting to think he might be an Ambrosini or Butt type for us, not that there's much wrong with that, rather than a nailed on starter.

1012~~~
This is the first time I've read this thread and I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one that hasn't been overly impressed.  I see him as being the physical holding mid that we all hoped Fellaini would be (before we realized he is too attack minded).  I don't mind having him sitting in the hole as I want to do anything possible to free Bastian up to be able to go everywhere and do it all for us.  I've rated him a 5.5 so far this season which is a good bit below the redcafe average.

1013~~~
It's clearly LVG's instructions, he wants 2 midfielders sitting at all times. He calls them a "double 6", obviously want's the front 4 players to take more risks, but that means holding the ball up and movement is extra important. That's why Martial's involvement has been such a big improvement.

1014~~~
Exactly. He does all the hard work behind the scenes which doesn't get noticed in the natural run of the game - but it is so critical in cutting off passing lanes and shielding the back four. As you said, it's no coincidence that our defense has instantly looked better and Southampton's is a mess. And for that reason I do agree that he is our most important signing.

1015~~~
I'll probably cop some flak for this, but that is an incredibly tame, borderline cowardly performance I've seen from one of our CMs inside OT for ages. 

He isn't asking for the ball, he's barely moving for people on the ball, and he's even pulling out of challenges (before the booking)! Needs to grow a set and start imposing himself more.

1016~~~
Disappointed in him. He doesn't really do anything on the ball, doesn't get on it enough and he hasn't been anywhere near the rock he was in front of the Saints back four. The games pass him by

1017~~~
His positioning off the ball when we have possession is poor. He doesn't get open enough.

Carrick-Schweinsteiger is our best CM pairing imo.

1018~~~
Same great passes today though, would like to see more of it.

1019~~~
He's struggling IMO.

1020~~~
Lucky not to get sent off tonight. Very rash at times and prone to jumping in to tackles when it's not needed.

1021~~~
Terrible tonight.

1022~~~
His play from losing the ball to then getting the booking was terrible. Could've been very costly for us.

1023~~~
He's new. You can excuse him.

1024~~~
Should have been sent off. Poor game.

1025~~~
I agree

I can't take to him at all

Just doesn't seem like a Utd player yet

1026~~~
Idiotic from him. And generally rubbish tonight. Not that impressed yet with him.

1027~~~
In a game like tonight were we were under pressure I would expect him to really stand out, but at times he was more of a hinderance

1028~~~
Seems a bit overawed so far, struggling to make the step up just yet. Needs to learn what he can and can't do in European games as well.

1029~~~
Really poor tonight. Worst game in our shirt, and, to be honest, he's looking out of his depth at the moment.

He'll improve as the seasons continues and we've to persevere with him until he does.

1030~~~
Played with so little intelligence tonight. Positioning was awful, and very rarely showed for the ball. Seemed quite content to let the game drift him by.

1031~~~
Carrick, Schweinisteiger, and Herrera are all better than him in midfield imo.

His defensive work is good, but it's not that good to excuse how poor he is at times when we have the ball. Has to improve.

1032~~~
Defensively poor dscisions, on the ball useless. He hides most of the times and just doesnt offer a lot in posession. Needs to improve massively

1033~~~
Had a shocker tonight, no doubt about it. 

The midfield went to pieces the moment Basti went off.

1034~~~
Champions league is an entirely different animal to him right now. He looks more comfortable in the league games.

1035~~~
Morgan looked like a big fish in a small pond tonight. Could not cope with the pressure of needing to win at this level. The moment where he dawdled with two players open to receive passes, which led to him losing the ball and us conceding a dangerous free kick, typified his night. It was like having an average centre back in midfield.

1036~~~
To an extent. I still think he's settling in and we've got a lot more to see from him, but that doesn't mean people aren't going to be critical if he has a poor game.

1037~~~
Poor today

1038~~~
This. He seems like a real backwards step in terms of what we're looking for. He doesn't seem to show for the ball, he's unbelievably negative and doesn't look confident in possession at all. 

He'll get time but as it stands he's looking massively out his depth. I'm really hoping that he's just struggling to adapt to the lack of space you get at United and with confidence will grow. However a big part of me thinks that his piers in his position are much better technically which is going to make it difficult for the fans to take to him.

1039~~~
Still needs adjusting to the CL and still a bit overawed but every minute counts as more experience

1040~~~
Yeah, I'm hoping he's just settling in etc. because, barring a few nice passes here and there, he's not been great with the ball at feet & made some silly errors in midfield. Carrick is a much better bet ATM.

1041~~~
He's a Gattuso, or so I've always thought. Very solid and occasionally brilliant if he has a game controller playing besides him, leaving him to do all the donkey work, but ask him to play and he fell to pieces.

Early days though, he'll improve.

1042~~~
Small fish. Big pond. Otherwise, yep, agreed.

1043~~~
Poor game. No where near as concerned as some in here, should still be in the starting xi alongside Schweini imo

1044~~~
His performance in the cL has been average so far.

1045~~~
Disappointing tonight. He's never played CL football before and it showed. Just needs to start playing with a bit more belief. He'll improve. Give him time.

1046~~~
He looked a lot worse once Schweinsteiger went off imo.

1047~~~
He's been fine this season overall. He had a poor game tonight but that's okay. The CL experience and playing alongside Bastian will do him wonders in the long run.

1048~~~
Poor tonight, he doesn't offer a lot on the ball as it is but he looked flustered defensively as well.

1049~~~
He really struggled tonight.

But it was his first match at this level and I'm willing to let it slide somewhat due to nerves. I expect he'll improve. He seems like the type.

1050~~~
The 'not showing for the ball' rhetoric doesn't ring true at all, mind you. He was offering for Smalling a lot more than Schweinsteiger was, albeit I acknowledge the latter plays more to the left. 

With Rooney resembling more of a rounded ornament it makes the midfield's job that little bit harder.

1051~~~
I hope he doesn't have the Southampton curse as well

1052~~~
Owen Hargreavesesque. 

And he wasn't even good defensively. His involvement was awful at their goal.

1053~~~
Which curse? Shaw was/is magnificent.

1054~~~
Overawed by the occasion?

He would benefit from having another midfielder making himself available for passes.

1055~~~
And he broke his leg....(I forgot about Shaw)

1056~~~
He shone in a box to box role last season at Southampton.

He'll probably need this season for settling in.

1057~~~
What, injured?  Owen was a decent player on the odd occasion he made it onto the pitch.

Anyway, MS has generally been decent too, but was shit today.

1058~~~
No he didn't he played a holding mf in a partnership with Wanyama and was never box to box, was highlight in the league for interceptions/tackles but with much less output going forward. 

He made a number of good tackles/blocks/interceptions tonight which seem to go unnoticed. We are excellent in defensive and statistically  allow the least amount of passes completed in their defensive zone by a substantially large margin in comparison to every other side in the premier league. It's no huge surprise that he comes along and Smalling/Blind look like a great partnership.

1059~~~
Clyne is doing well fro Liverpool. Nothing to do with curse, shit happens and Schneiderlin needs time. The others were never good enough.

1060~~~
Are you sure? The times I saw him play last season, he definitely seemed more of a box to box midfielder.

1061~~~
He was OK thought  he was going to get sent off. First time playing in the champions league so deserves some slack.

1062~~~
Julien Laurens (french journo) was on the game podcast this week and he talked about his chat with Morgan during the last international break where Morgan had told him that LVG was different to any other manager & how training sessions are full of giving a lot of information to players about minor things. So I think he will take some time

1063~~~
That is because he definitely was.

1064~~~
I think today for me was his best performance in a purely judgmental self improvement way. 

Whenever ive seen him play; he has lacked passing ability and is the only player who slows the tempo of the ball down. 

Today was different and he was a bit more confident with the ball and played some nice cross field passes.

1065~~~
IMO he isnt a box to box as much as makalele wasnt.  Though this formation and tactics cant handle one player like makelele who waits for trouble.

1066~~~
He had some excellent cross field passes.

1067~~~
Yep i kept thinkong it was schweinsteiger!

1068~~~
No he wasn't. <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/news/lovren-gets-all-the-love-but-this-silent-enforcer-has-been-the-true-catalyst-for-southampton/26621" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/news/lovren-...-been-the-true-catalyst-for-southampton/26621</a>

Go look on whoscored or Opta, he led the league in tackles and was number 1 or 2 in interceptions along with being all round excellent defensively. Take a look at his offensive work and how low the number of passes in final 3rd/key passes along with goals and assists. He was never a box to box midfielder.

1069~~~
It depended on the game and opponent. Koeman switched things around a fair bit everywhere. I saw games where MS held and others where he had a bit more license. Some games Wanyama was a DM and others he pressed aggressively. Sometimes they had a 3rd man helping them and other times the 10 was a striker who didn't do much.

1070~~~
In some ways, disappointing as it may sound, MS may end up being a decent signing as a role player.

Gattuso played with Pirlo and Seedorf at his best. We have one player of that quality in Schweinsteiger (and Carrick filling in to keep him rested) and will need to find another. If we are aggressive in the transfer market and sign another top CM we will have Schneiderlin to spell 2 top CMs, at times play together and otherwise gets lots of playing time and hurting our passing but improving our energy and work rate.

Assuming we progress well and play 58 games (38 + 12CL + 8 Cup) a year, that's 116 starts. 40 for Schweinsteiger (coming off Euros, too), 30 for Schneiderlin and 16 for Carrick next year would still leave 30 for one more CM adjusting in his first year and then another 16 for a full time season with Carrick presumably being in his final season in 16-17. Seems fine to me. 

The question is if that's Herrera or if that's a new player.

1071~~~
Atleast he seems to be self-aware unlike our captain: 

<i>“<b>Yeah it was a big game and a game where I and we can improve</b>. It was a big game against a big team from Europe and we are very happy to play in this stage of football and we want to go through to keep our dream alive. We want to see how far we can go. If we can keep this team spirit and if we keep improving like we have done since the start of the season, then why not?”</i>

1072~~~
A tough night for him, but I'm hopeful he can make the step up.

1073~~~
That's a pretty reductive way to look at things. He was definitely excellent defensively, but that doesn't mean he was not a B2B player. Of the two Southampton midfielders he had more of a license to operate forwards - just google Schneiderlin Box to Box and you'll come across loads of articles noting his transition from a DM to a box to box player in his final year at Soton. He had 4 goals and 1 key pass a game last year, which is quite a lot for a supposed pure DM.

1074~~~
Is he actually abit over-rated? I remember a lot here wanted the club to pay the money to get him here and sees him as a perfect number 6 before he even signed. So far he hasn't showed the qualities

1075~~~
Worth remembering where he's coming from and that he'll probably need more time to adapt. Playing for Southampton isn't the same thing as playing for United and Southampton's support rate him more highly than most people on here probably do. He has improved throughout his career at different levels and recently he's said that he's still getting used to van Gaal philosophy. Not everyone is settling in like van Persie or Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin isn't as talented as them, so he'll probably need longer. And he has shown some of his qualities, but he should be doing better in possession.

1076~~~
I thought he did in his first game but since then he hasnt looked like he's settled properly yet. It might take a little time to get a proper understanding with one of his partners in midfield, and he seems to have a different one each time which might be delaying things as well. But he can definitely do more than he's shown so far. At the moment he's winning the ball plenty (the most of all our players) but just moving the ball fairly averagely. When he really gets going he will show more on the ball and do a better job plugging the gaps

1077~~~
Started well, but he was terrible towards the end. Probably should have been sent of too.

1078~~~
There were too risky challenged toward the end that put my heart in mouth. The one on Draxler and a lunge in a similar position moments earlier - luckily their lad had played the ball and moved because if he'd caught him he'd have been off.

1079~~~
In last 3 years at Southampton he managed 9 goals and 2 assists and His stats on whoscored show less than 1 key pass per game in all of those years. His offensive numbers pale in comparison to his defensive output which was arguably best in the entire league. He never was or is a box to box CM.

1080~~~
Off game for him yesterday, was facing the brunt of the pressure since we decided to sit incredibly deep for a majority of the second half. Schweinsteiger going off didn't help matters either. 

But we all know the quality that he brings to the team, so it's nothing to get worried about in my opinion. He'll be causing Arsenal trouble on Sunday.

1081~~~
Stats aren't everything. Just because he didn't score 15 goals or rack up loads of assists doesn't mean he was not a box to box player. Of the Wanyama-Schneiderlin pairing he was the one with significantly more license to go forward and his transition to a box to box player was repeatedly noted throughout his final year at Southampton. 

A limited selection of articles that mention Schneiderlin as a B2B player. 

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/11804640/Morgan-Schneiderlin-showing-why-he-is-Manchester-Uniteds-most-important-signing.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/fo...anchester-Uniteds-most-important-signing.html</a>

1082~~~
Stats are more relevant than whatever narrative you've thought up in your head to suit your argument, even more so when the stats make it so overwhelmingly obvious as to what his role is. 

Those articles go no way to proving he's a B2B midfielder, in fact the first article actually cites all of his defensive stats as to why he's bossing the midfield. Tackles/Interceptions/Duels/Clearances. His heat map which is used as an example isn't very hard to understand when he's playing vs a side like Villa and United have 65%+ of the ball of course the majority of his average position will be in their half. 

The 2nd article has one comment which speculates he could fill the B2B role if he moved to Spurs and the 3rd aricle is even more hilarious since the only inclusion of B2B was him being asked who his heroes were and he said Gerrard/Zidane because they could play either role. 

Let's look at how he compares offensively vs the obvious B2B CM's in the league:

              Yaya          Cesc        Henderson      Schneiderlin      Ramsey
Goals         36            22               15                    9                 17

Assists       15             41              20                    2                  16

SPG           3.1            1.6             1.4                  1.2                2.2

KeyP         1.4             2.8             1.8                  0.9               1.6

Drib           1.8            1.1              0.5                  0.6               1.3

He's miles behind all of them in almost every category offensively. The opposite appears when you looks at his defensive contributions where he beats every single one of them with tackles/interceptions/blocks/duels/clearances and actually leads the entire league in a number of those.

1083~~~
He was poor yesterday, and hasnt reached his standard in the league either. Still im convinced he will turn good.

1084~~~
This is simply not worth it. Southampton supporters considered him a box to box player in his final year. It's more than possible for a player to be oriented towards defensive stats, while still being a box to box player, a la Keane. A player like Yaya is also a box to box player, but he (and Cesc etc) are attacking oriented. Box to box doesn't exclusively mean an attacking CM which seems to be your conception of the position with the players you've quoted.

1085~~~
I didn't know you were Southampton's rep on Redcafe and could speak for their entire fanbase. And as I pointed out in those stats, Schneiderlin is behind those players in almost every single category offensively and ahead of them all in almost every category defensively. It's not difficult.

1086~~~
You've just proven his point.

1087~~~
He doesn't score and assist enough to be a top level box-to-box midfielder. If you want to be the that player, with another player being the holding player, you need to be getting a fair share of goal involvements - like Yaya or Ramsey.

1088~~~
Obviously meant he's behind then offensively and ahead defensively.

1089~~~
Baffles me he didn't start today,  our midfield is getting mullered

1090~~~
Baffles me he hasn't been substituted on too.

1091~~~
Should be playing these games. Mind boggling decision to leave him out.

1092~~~
Put him on for Memphis or Rooney.

1093~~~
That's exactly why you play this guy. He doesn't go forward much, isn't a top, top passer but we've virtually got no midfield now.

1094~~~
Really missed today.

1095~~~
We need him on. He should have been brought on as soon as that second Arsenal goal went in.

1096~~~
These were the games he wasn brought in to play, against quick midfielders. His mobility and tenacity wouldn't have given Arsenal the time they've had today. Carrick, as much as I like him, has been a scarecrow. He doesn't have the mobility to recover when a ball goes behind him or to track the run of someone like Ozil or Sanchez. He should have started.

1097~~~
Should be playing.

1098~~~
Why even buy him if you're going to play two pensioners ahead of him?
I'm not saying we'd have won but starting him could have at least kept it respectable.

1099~~~
Feel it would have been a different game if he started. I thought we bought him for games like this.

1100~~~
today's game was crying out for him, especially during the early stages. not sure why he didn't get the start as I had predicted.

1101~~~
The match was begging for him to play in, especially since he would have loved to stick one in Arsenal's face.

He may have not performed as well as we would have wanted him to in recent matches, but nobody will tell me the manager had to pull him out of his element because of how he played against Wolfsburg in mid-week.

1102~~~
Seems to play more games at home than away, which is surprising.

1103~~~
LVG's use of him has been bizarre to say the least.

1104~~~
We missed him against Arsenal. Carrick and BFS was bound to backfire.

1105~~~
I don't see much point in us predominantly using Schneiderlin in games where we boss possession and the opposition sit back. He's ideal for the games where we need a ball winner in midfield as he's someone who isn't afraid to put his foot in and make tackles. The opposition rarely waltz through our midfield when he plays so he should be playing all the games against other possession teams as his best qualities are useful to us then.

I should probably point out that I haven't watched the Arsenal game, as I was working and was a bit put off watching the recording when I got in, but I've read a few bits and pieces and my Dad's given me his summary...

1106~~~
Agree with this entirely. He should be playing when we don't dominate the ball. Far, far too slow in CM yesterday without him.

1107~~~
I know LVG isn't simplistic but it really feels as if he has ordered his CMs as BFS, Carrick and schneiderlin in that order and plays them as such. BFS + Carrick for important games and schneiderlin with 1 of them when they need rest. It's baffling because I'd put schneiderlin as the 1st CM in the team for most matches especially the big ones.

1108~~~

1109~~~
He'll come good, it takes time to adapt to what LvG demands as we saw with a few players last season.

1110~~~
He's currently in the Ander Herrera role from last season. Wanted by fans, needed by the team but learning the philosophy still and probably underused till the second half of the campaign.

Which brings me onto Ander Herrera. Time to weep in his thread. Why Louis why!

1111~~~
I agree. He should. Carrick has been underwhelming this season. Schneiderlin deserves a run of games. He's young and fit enough to be playing back to back games, and he offers better protection to the back four than Carrick and Schweinsteiger.

Schmidfield need to be on the pitch at the same time, and more often.

1112~~~
French finishing <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1113~~~
Back in the team with a bang!

1114~~~
Still baffled why he didn't start at the Emirates.

1115~~~
That's more like it <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

1116~~~

1117~~~
He's been top class today, a rock and his passing has been decent too.

1118~~~
Should be a starter for us. Ridiculous how he was left out vs Arsenal.

1119~~~
showed today why he's so important to our team, especially in big games. not starting him against arsenal was such a disastrous mistake to make.

not to take any credit away from herrera though, who was fantastic himself as well.

1120~~~
<a class="username" data-user="51833, @Bojan11" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/51833/">@Bojan11</a> 

He gets an 8/10 from me

Passing was generally excellent, kept it simple mostly which was super

Lovely goal

But mainly his positioning in particular when we were under pressure at the start of 2nd half was great

His best game by an absolute country mile for us

1121~~~
Even without his goal, he's MOTM for me.

1122~~~
Fantastic performance.

1123~~~
Goal and crucial interception for the third, exactly what we've missed against Arsenal.

1124~~~
Loved the way the midfield understood each other when they were in defensive mode. He and BFS closed down really well and provided lots of platforms for passes. And he scored too!

1125~~~
Best game for us.

1126~~~
Amazing how he didn't start vs Arsenal.

Mistakes made from LvG, but hopefully this type of performance is what is needed to cement his place in the team.

1127~~~
Much better passing from him. Agree that it was his best game so far.

1128~~~
He was immense, seemed more confident in his passing.

1129~~~
Motm today he completly bossed the midfield and showed why he should be one of the first names on the teamsheet.

1130~~~
His best performance in a United shirt to date.

1131~~~
Easily his best match for Man Utd and that is without the goal being taken into account.

1132~~~
Showed a little more than he has done to this point and generally seemed more confident and decisive. Add that to his defensive tenacity and he could become a crucial part of the team if he can keep it up. I rated him the same as Herrera but he just misses out on MOM to him.

1133~~~
Should play every game, look more solid with him in the middle.

1134~~~
Definitely his best performance to date. His passing was more penetrative and his defensive work was great today.

1135~~~
He and Basti made McCarthy their bitch.

1136~~~
Brilliant game from him, undoubtedly his best for us so far. Ran the show in midfield and scored a goal with a composed finish.

Not starting him against Arsenal looks an even worse decision now.

1137~~~
My stream was a bit choppy and I didn't get to watch the full game but imo Schneiderlin to me is one of those players that you have to have in your team because of his energy, physical graft and movement AHEAD of other things like passing etc. 

That's to say I can forgive him if he's a poor/limited passer because he makes that up through sheer dynamism in other aspects. The fact he's not a bad passer at all makes it even better.

1138~~~
He is going to be such a top star for us....wonderful performance. And no..I don't expect it every time...but it's there and the consistency will come from experience and age. He is going to be a top top player.

1139~~~
He had the midfield on lockdown, incredible player. No surprises.

1140~~~
You beautiful French dragon!

1141~~~
Morgan feckin Schneiderlin.

1142~~~
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CRiFM6wWwAAhaic.jpg:large" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CRiFM6wWwAAhaic.jpg:large"/>

1143~~~
Excellent performance. One of the most important players in the side, for me.

1144~~~
Fantastic today, limited Naismith and Barkley to nothing but a few long range efforts.

1145~~~
Was very good today. Looked especially confident passing the ball.

1146~~~
Solid performance. Nice little pass and move interchanges that helped move the ball around the pitch; more dynamic today than in his previous couple games. When he plays like this he's a definite starter and a big piece of our midfield puzzle.

1147~~~
Echo what others have said. Clearly his best performance for us. Very good passing to add to his work rate. MOTM for me even without the goal.

1148~~~
Always preferred him to McCarthy and was glad we went for him instead. Top player.

1149~~~
He's had other good defensive game but this was his best for us on the ball, seemed more composed and accurate.

1150~~~
He so obviously should have started against Arsenal - would have made so much of a difference in those first 30 minutes.

1151~~~
He simply has to start for us, along with Ander. Brilliant today and really should play the big games, tough away games.

1152~~~
Best game yet, in my opinion, and topped it off with a goal. Great performance.

1153~~~
Absolute beast today, dominated midfield and showed great skill at times going forward. My motm today

1154~~~
Very good today and he was a considerable factor in Lukaku's frustration (not just Smalling and Jones' performances) and Everton having trouble in the midfield battle. Stifled their creativity and his energy, together with Herrera and BFS' movement and generalship was a very good, dynamic trio for us.

Need to see that trio in action again. Huge promise to it.

1155~~~
He's the most obvious beneficiary of our increased urgency in getting the ball forward with haste. The options Herrera and Mata offer him to unload the ball quickly also open spaces for him to be even more adventurous if he wants to be.

1156~~~
My man of the match today. Must always start tough away matches.

1157~~~
Thought was was very good today and I agree it was the best we've seen in a Utd shirt, and I honestly think he can still play a lot better than that as well. I still think he needs to be a little bit more careful when rushing into the tackle as he gave away two or three silly free kicks around the edge of our box that in another day could easily cost us. But overall a good display.

1158~~~
Better passer than Keane.

1159~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1160~~~
I'm surprised the bait has taken forty minutes to get a bite.

1161~~~

1162~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1163~~~
Definitely his best game today.

1164~~~
7tackles and 2 interceptions, fantastic positional play, didn't let Everton have a single opening through the middle. 97% pass acc is bonus with the winning goal. He was my joint 2nd best player of the game with Ander as the MOTM award has to go to Smalldini. Everton in this form away from home, especially against us who struggle in away games, that is fecking huge - clean sheet at Goodison..

back to Morgan, him and Herrera being lined-upagainst Arsenal from minute one and that shit would have never happened..

1165~~~
He along with Herrera need to start pretty much every game we play this season in the league. Morgan, happy he got his goal too. Topped a good performance from him.

1166~~~
Now that's the Schneiderlin we signed! Best performance for us so far and if it weren't for Herrera he'd have been my man of the match.

Imperative he plays when fit.

1167~~~
Absolutely outstanding today. <i>Thats</i> why I was desperate for us to sign him!

Completely bossed the midfield.

1168~~~
Didn't know he had 97% pass rate in the game. What a beast.

1169~~~
To be fair EVERYONE in the team benefits from having 3 proper midfielders on the pitch in the middle of the park and not some converted 2nd striker business. 

With the players we have, we simply can not expect to build a team/strong style without having those 3 in the middle. I.e we do not have a Robben/Ribbery on the wings, who double as playmakers/highly intelligent ball playing players, who also more than do their bit with their attacking contribution.

1170~~~
Been down on him but obviously played very well today. Good stuff.

1171~~~
The sort of performance I was hoping for when we signed him. Very happy to see him grab a goal too.

1172~~~
Very glad he's finally had that breakout game, probably the biggest positive aside from the result for me. He's been signed as the long term replacement for Carrick & Basti, and he's been pretty iffy so far. Getting him in form an comfortable in the shirt was a big priority for this early season period.

Yep. He was decent before this game, without really standing out ever, but was terrific today, ignoring the goal. He always shows his tackling and defensive qualities, but today he put it together on the ball and showed quality on it as well, which is what is needed at a club like United. A shame that it isn't Arsenal we were playing next week, because it would be a completely different game with Herrera and Schneiderlin in the middle next to Schweinsteiger, instead of what we saw.

1174~~~
Great performance by Morgan. Really must have been a confident fillip this game for him and we need him like this in all the games. Involved, tackling, breaking down play. Definite starter every game for me. Keep rotating Bastian and Carrick.

1175~~~
I thought this game was his first time in a United shirt that he finally showed his quality on the ball. He showed that kind of passing for Southampton on a regular basis but had been very conservative as a United player up until now. Like others have said, even without the goal, it was his best performance as a United player so far.

1176~~~
He showed today that he's also very good with the ball. Finally he stepped up, it was a very all rounded performance and that's the player we needed to have! Hope he stays in the team now and that should be our starting XI more or less

1177~~~
Him and Ander need to play a lot more. They instil real urgency and legs into the side. Everton's midfield didn't know what to do for the first 20 minutes.

1178~~~
Both Morgan and Ander add energy, tempo and tenacity to our midfield. They should be starting most games for us.

The Schmidfielders complement each other well also.

Schneiderlin's stats yesterday were fantastic.

Schneiderlin's game by numbers: 7 tackles and 2 interceptions show he did his devensive shift as usual. Involved a lot in our general play having the most passes in our team with 67 completed  passes and a 97% pass accuracy. All topped off with a goal. Can't really ask for too much more for a complete midfield performance. Hope he continues in the line-up and performing in a similar fashion.

1179~~~

1180~~~
Astute.

1181~~~

1182~~~
Schneiderlin and Herrera did a hell of a job at cementing their place in the starting line up yesterday. Solid performance.

1183~~~
Herrera creates much more space for him in the middle and gives him more passing options. Very good game from him yesterday, not only defensive-wise.

1184~~~
I think that was his best game for us so far, he should be starting ahead of Carrick in every match. He puts himself about far more than he would.

1185~~~
Beast.

1186~~~
Still made a few niggly needless little fouls, but that was a very small negative on a hugely positive performance. This was the type of performance he showed for Southampton regularly, and the main reason why he is here now. No doubt showed LVG how wrong he was to drop him for Arsenal.

1187~~~
I thought he had another good game. 

Much better than at start of the season when people were praising him while he was pretty average. He definitely deserves a place in starting XI now though.

1188~~~
Best player on the pitch. Was pinging it around nicely as well.

1189~~~
Was very good again. We look so much better defensively also when he's playing.

1190~~~
Another very good performance from him and in my opinion it should be him plus 2 in midfield from now on.

1191~~~
Was good. One of only a very few.

1192~~~
He must start against City. I'll be furious if we play Basti and Carrick on the weekend.

1193~~~
MOTM by a distance.

1194~~~
His switches of play, breaking up counters and general positioning were immense tonight. 2 footed diagonal balls. Rooney and Gerrard dream of that stuff.

1195~~~
Very good today again, my MOTM too.

1196~~~
Excellent today. Man of the match for me.

1197~~~
Very impressed by him today.

1198~~~
At times one of the only players who were able to make that yard of space for themselves.

1199~~~
Best player for us today. Should be one of the first names on the team sheet now.

1200~~~
Best player tonight. Very good.

1201~~~
Plays much better having another midifelder in there instead of Rooney. His passing has been really good recently, particularly when he's switching the ball.

1202~~~
Another good game. My MOTM today. His passing is becoming more and more penetrative. Great to see.

1203~~~
I think he will be dropped against City which would be a shame because these last two games he was immense.

Should be the first name on the teamsheet really.

1204~~~
Dropping him would be a monumentally stupid thing to do.

1205~~~
Doing a good job, fair play to him.

1206~~~
He was decent. After Herrera he was our best player

But at times very sloppy passing, Just needs to keep it simple

1207~~~
Good performance. I voted Martial MoM but Schneiderlin was our most consistent and best player today. Just went with Martial because the goal gave a important point.

1208~~~
He should seriously be a first team player, just showing the reasons why I wanted United to buy him so much.

1209~~~
He is going to be one of the best buys of the season.

1210~~~
very good at his position.

1211~~~
If the Arsenal game hadn't gone the way it did, he probably would be dropped.

1212~~~
Thought he was really important today. Can't remember him putting a foot wrong and showed incredible composure under pressure at times.

1213~~~
Looks to be finding his composure on the ball and is now using it really well.

1214~~~
MOM for me, didn't do anything special but did his job well and provided a solid base for others to do so (the fact that they didn't can't be blamed on him).

1215~~~
He was poor against Wolfsburg but it looks like LvG must have given him a dressing down.

Looked good against Everton and very assured today. Great to see.

1216~~~
LVG probably gave himself a dressing down for not playing him vs Arsenal

1217~~~
Brilliant today.

1218~~~
I'm one of the few who had no problem with him being dropped after the Wolfsburg game (that was before our awful start against Arsenal). He made those around him look bad because he wouldn't show for the ball. Haven't seen that from him since...

1219~~~
The spine of our team looks really strong with Jones / Smalling behind Morgan.
Fills me with confidence ahead of the City game. If KDB starts centrally we could handle him with those 3 playing as they are.

1220~~~
My MOTM. A tiny bit sloppy with his passing but I will forgive him because he makes us so solid defensively.

1221~~~
Will be key v City.

1222~~~
I've got a bit of a nasty feeling with Basti going off and Carrick not appearing recently, we might be starting with Basti/Carrick on Sunday, which would be ridiculous.

As for Schneiderlin, he's starting to boss it in the middle for us. He has to start along with Ander.

1223~~~
Such a good solid signing.

1224~~~
I think he was great on the ball, it's good to see him being more confident, trying a through ball from time to time and carry the ball forward. Top signing , I think at the end of the season he will prove my words right that he will be an uprade on Carrick

1225~~~
So your criticism of him before was that he keeps it simple too much and you never seen a player like that at Man Utd. 

Now you want him to keep it simple when he does try risk passes.

1226~~~
Don't think I have ever critisised him for keeping it simple too much

I have critisised him at times for failing to get into games poor passing and poor pass selection. I would encourage him always to keep it simple

1227~~~
Was very good again today, made plenty of interceptions and kept the ball ticking over nicely, found Herrera quite a few times with some nice forward passes. 

We definitely need his energy in CM, we just look so much better with him and Herrera.

1228~~~
I thought he was excellent. Great energy and made some excellent long passes.

1229~~~
I love how he's two footed and people said he couldn't be Carrick's successor. Schneiderlin can no doubt pass but he needs confidence to show that and that he's got right now. He will only get better if he plays regularly, still 25. Him and Herrera bossed it tonight.

1230~~~
Bossed the midfield today. Great performance, lots of energy and attempted to get the play going forwards.

1231~~~
I think some didn't see him as Carrick's successor as he's different. A bit like the Carrick and Keane thoughts years back due to how different they are/were.

1232~~~
Another good game, seems to be better alongside Basti and Herrera. Must start against City.

1233~~~
This.

1234~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/cska-moscow-1-manchester-united-1-reaction-morgan-schneiderlin-admits-team-need-to-create-more-a6703581.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/...admits-team-need-to-create-more-a6703581.html</a>

When our most defensive minded midfielder comes up with this theory. He's spot on.

1235~~~
All 3 of them are better alongside each other. It's a very good group of midfielders, though it's not necessary when the other team parks the bus. For any big game though, where the other team doesn't sit at the edge of their box for 90 minutes with the occasional counter, it's a great trio. Just lacked a bit of creativity today (could've used Mata/Memphis earlier I think).

1236~~~
I think Herrera missed Mata today, he links up with him and makes space. Basti had a quiet game too. Hope we start with those three against City though.

1237~~~
2 good games in a row. Much sharper on the ball. Good stuff.

1238~~~
Thought he was our best player, I'm liking the  forward passing he's shown in the past couple of games. Needs to start vs City.

1239~~~
Exactly. I'm not getting all the praise of his passing this game. Was good defensively, and held us together after Schweiny went off, but the team is carrying him going forward and right now we've too many players like that. Either he needs to improve technically himself or the players around him need improving (Rooney, Jones, Rojo).

1240~~~
It was his first game in the UCL. Prior to that he had played a number of PL games and been one of the key reasons for our defensive stability.
How knee jerk is that to drop him after one game, when we had Rooney and Memphis playing like crap for the majority of the season. He made a mistake playing 2 slow CM vs Arsenal and their speedy attack.

1241~~~
He has played himself into the starting lineup. Great performances and now he is becoming part of the spine. DDG-Smalling-Schneiderlin. 

We are moving on from Carrick. 

He is actually revelling playing as the deepest of the midfielders, instead of beside Carrick.

1242~~~

1243~~~
Beastman. And he's not even at his best. That accuracy is boss, especially knowing that he goes for the long cross a couple of times pr. game. That being said, Ander with 87 with all the fast plays and creativity is also impressive as feck.

1244~~~
Bastian tut tut

1245~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/jwdb" width="560"></iframe>

1246~~~
He'll be very vital tomorrow. How he does vs De Bruyne could decide the game. Him and Herrera must be 2 of the middle 3.

1247~~~
This is the vision and passing he showed reguarly for Southampton and he is now beginning to do the same for us. 

Imagine a dynamic player besides him like Gundogan! <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1248~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1W5xc3gHR3w?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

7:09, 7:40 those are the pieces of moves you won't see from Carrick. Everything is while moving unlike standing Carrick waiting to pass the ball, it's really refreshing to see modern elements of game in modern game. He has also quite great agility which makes him quite good in tight paces or on turn. Get him in this confident mode every game and we are not gonna have problems in midfield with anyone. 

I remember how some smartassses here claimed how much better Carrick is at positioning, well I think the numbers speak for themselves. Morgan's basically everywhere he needs to be to win the ball and closes all the spaces like a boss, great to see him not being shy with his passing  too, he's currently bossing it. It's also great to see someone who can run for 90 mins and not being overrun... 

And this guy has just started, first season in a new club, imagine in what he can develop into when learning from Schweisteigger or even Carrick. I think he will be one of our key players in the future alongside with Herrera, Mike, Luke and Martial...

1249~~~
Because when those same people talk about Carrick's positioning they recognise that Carrick and Morgan screen the backline quite differently. If you want to talk about how Carrick positions himself in order to close off passing lanes in order to force opponents to play another pass, then yes Carrick is way superior. Morgan is more dynamic in that he's the one charging down and actually closing down for a tackle.

1250~~~
that's the exact bullshit I was talking about, or YOU are talking about now... There is no doubt Morgan is more aggressive but he closes down the space equally well if not better. just watch the game and don't repeat the same old shit again and again. The dynamism gives Schneiderlin option to quickly close down passing lines which Carrick can't reach as he's too slow. Schneiderlin showed he can play that for Soton and he's showing it to us, still there will be people who argue bout that (it's becoming annoying now) he can close down spaces and passing lanes like you said either from the deep and in advanced role. Just because Carrick can't play aggressive game anymore doesn't make him much better from the deeper more passive role. We've seen that against Arsenal who bullied Carrick like a small child. Schneiderlin is much better defensively than Carrick that's why he starts and will start every game now on.. 

Do they both read the game well? Yes. Can they both execute all sorts of defensive moves? Not really, Carrick simply struggles to be more proactive, his defensive work is just limited. Yes we can make compact unit with him and defend passively but who wants to watch the ball being passed around by opposition for ages. That's what we lacked for ages! A player who can make tackle/interception to win the ball for the team to set a counter.. Who do you want to play against teams like Barcelona, Bayern or Arsenal? You want palyer who can close down the spaces and passing lines quickly as well as someone who will make that tackle/interception and give us a breather.. Funny how a fact that Morgan won more balls statisitically can be turned around in favour to Carrick that he just better at closing off the passing lanes. What do we fecking do btw, park the buss? Mr untouchable's getting hits in the ring but there are still some referees who gives him good numbers for the rounds he doesn't deserve to win. Hilarious

1251~~~
Jeez calm down for fecks sake. Your quoting of the won more balls stat exactly highlights my case. Carrick doesn't make as many tackles as Morgan does. There was a piece done by Gary on Monday Night Football about Carrick's defensive play and if you go watch it you can see why so he's considered underrated by many and highly rated by other top midfielders.

1252~~~
By far his toughest test so far this season and he's come out looking pretty good, I'd say. Makes his absence against Arsenal even more baffling.

1253~~~
Doing well again. 3 impressive games in a row

1254~~~
Agreed. Carrick will be struggling to return as a starter at this rate.

1255~~~
Looked excellent the first 25-30 minutes, but it hink he didnt dominate it after that anymore, which showed because City started being more dangerous and especially Yaya got too much room.

1256~~~
Needs to get onto Yaya a bit quicker.

1257~~~
Another top half from him, his positioning is excellent and if he's in for a 50/50 you just expect him to win it.

1258~~~
He's fantastic.

1259~~~
Best signing in the summer. Martial is good, but United'd crumble to pieces without this guy.

1260~~~
Absolute fecking tank. 

Shocking he wasn't MOTM today.

1261~~~
Our MOTM today.

1262~~~
Big game player. Another very good performance.

1263~~~
Yeah I went for him as motm

1264~~~
Another good performance I though. Looks settled now.

1265~~~
Absolutely brilliant again. Even if City had Aguero and Silva he'd still deal with them.

So happy with this signing <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1266~~~
His best game for us IMO.

1267~~~
Very good game once again, he is becoming one of our most important players.

1268~~~
MOTM for me, why the feck he didn't play against Arsenal I'll never know

1269~~~
Fantastic second half.

1270~~~
Already said it, but i'll repeat myself again. He'd tackle a cactus tree if needed to.

1271~~~
Glad to see you changing your tune on him. 

He was brilliant and these are the sort of matches he was brought in for.

1272~~~
Between him and Rojo for MOTM. Excellent.

1273~~~
Me too. Was excellent, just makes me wonder even more why he didn't play vs Arsenal

1274~~~
Good game again. He's settled in now it seems.

He's a must in midfield for big games. The exclusion of him vs Arsenal is becoming more and more baffling.

1275~~~
Hes starting to put in his Southampton performance, absolutely brilliant player and I'm so glad we signed him.

1276~~~
Very good match, he is still adapting to his new club so i expect even more from him in the future.

1277~~~
Very good, yet again. Love him!

1278~~~
Third match in row I have given him my motm vote now and on current form he is one of the best players in the league.

1279~~~
This is why I wanted us to sign him, absolutely brilliant and his game on the ball has gone up a few notches.

1280~~~
Brilliant game, showed how much we needed him in the Arsenal game. Should be a starter in every game now.

1281~~~
Been very impressive since the Everton game. Not Carrick yet, but very very good.

1282~~~
Exactly what we've missed for years. He's better than just your average ball winner also, he can actually pass.

1283~~~
His passing has improved a lot. More positive.

1284~~~
would have my motm today if it wasn't for rojo.

1285~~~
My motm today.

1286~~~
I gave him MOTM, very close between him and Rojo, his ground coverage side to side across our back line was excellent and protected the CB's all game.

1287~~~
Fantastic again. Passing was neat and made so many vital interceptions. That tackle at the end where he took the booking could have been so important, they might have scored if he didn't disrupt that. We've needed a midfielder like him for many many years.

1288~~~
Dominated their midfielders.

1289~~~
Worked his bollocks off today and caused their midfield all kinds of problems. Really good signing and a player who deserves more appreciation for what he does. Every team can do with someone like him.

1290~~~
Has to play every game against the big boys. When our attack starts functioning, we'll win a lot more games because of Morgan.

1291~~~
Class again. His passing has come on leaps and bounds.

1292~~~
Exactly what I've thought, for example Carrick would never make that tackle. We have a great upgrade here. Player with perfect positional sense who can cover basically all the ground and start attacks for us. It was always gonna take him a few games here and there to settle down and gain confidence. He's been excellent as no6 for the last three games. May he continue in this form. I still think we could do a bit better with the third midfielder, Basti's been good but he's not on top of his game against top sides a slight upgrade on Carrick. 

How about

               Schneiderlin 
             Herrera -  Pogba

But I think we should give that spot to one of our youngsters, Pereira/Pearson/TFM

1293~~~
Played well but I still think he can do better with his positioning when helping out the full back on his side (when in possession, in our own half.).

To often he doesn't move into space for the pass almost forcing the full back to drive forward or go long. He was better against CSKA but he was at it again today.

1294~~~
My MOTM. You never have the worry that an opposition player is just going to waltz their way through our midfield when Schneiderlin is playing.

1295~~~
He's so important for us, his passing has become better too.

1296~~~
Seems to be finding his feet in the team and really should be locked in as a starter based on the last three games. It is nice to have a genuinely dynamic player in front of the defenders for the first time in a while. He and Herrera would have made a fantastic duo in a 90's 4-4-2, between them they tick all the boxes.

1297~~~
He started the season relatively quietly (not badly, just quiet), but the last few matches he's starting to really show what he can bring to our team. It was a tough choice between him and Rojo for MOTM today, but Schneiderlin just edged it for me.

1298~~~
I think he struggled early on for us but he's really upped his game recently.

1299~~~
We should instruct him to provide additional protection for the backline by dispossessing Rooney before the fool gives it away.

1300~~~
He was my MOTM. Rojo did well but i think the wanking of rojo has to do with everyone melting down that he even started. Morgan for me was a 10 out of 10 for me. Gave them nothing in midfield, passed the ball well and gave his defense only high balls to bony to deal with. Was really impressed by him especially his passing. Great Acquisition

1301~~~
Leicester City away doesnt happen with a guy like him in the side.

1302~~~
Played very well and again showed why he clearly should have played against Arsenal

1303~~~
he was impressive in opening minutes to make two mistakes in the middle of the pitch halfway through the first half, two hard situations really... but he shake it off quickly to boss it again..

tbf Fernandinho had a great game too but he's not as good on the ball like our Morgan, best acquisition of the summer

1304~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/t31.0-8/s960x960/12186508_10153307812727746_9050014287168341440_o.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.ne...8_10153307812727746_9050014287168341440_o.jpg</a>

1305~~~
Absolute machine at the base of the midfield today and his passing is getting better and better too, those flat switching passes out to our wide men in particular are impressing me.

1306~~~
3 absolutely faultless performances in a row. He's an absolute monster.

1307~~~
How good is this guy for the defensive organization of the team? We've conceded just 7 goals in his 11 games played (2-1 loss to Swansea, 3-1 win against Liverpool, 3-2 win against Southampton, 2-1 vs Wolfsburg, 1-1 with CSKA). We hardly give away any chances when he's on the pitch. Was a massive part of why Southampton had the best defensive record in the league last season and why it'll probably be us this season. He's also improving every game on the ball as well. Just makes our midfield so solid alongside Herrera and Schweinsteiger. I don't think any team will ever get much joy against that midfield trio, as they're all class all round midfielders but balance each other nicely.

1308~~~
Yep, while we are hardly blowing away many teams they sure as hell aren't scoring many against us either. When he's in the team he breaks up play and makes so many great interceptions. He was key to that 2nd half performance where we just kept pressing and retaining the ball. Really do love him.

1309~~~
It genuinely feels good to have a top midfield again. Having it neglected for so long made me forget how amazing it is to have one. 

Now if we can just sort out a few other areas...

1310~~~
I am so glad he is putting all doubters here to shame. Last 3-4 performances have shown why he has been top draw in his position last couple of seasons. What a buy! and what a player!

1311~~~
Was really good yesterday. His reading of the game and positioning was superb. Played a few good cross field passes too.

1312~~~
Long passing, especially diagonal pass to the wings have become better and better. Great player, he will be a very important player in future. I hope we can buy him a partner and not let him be the new carrick  after basti and carrick are done. Herrera is more of a 10 for me who can play as an 8 rather than natural 8

1313~~~
The guy seems to following a similar trajectory to most new purchases (successful ones) made by LVG where they initially do well and show their talent, then fall off for a bit where they often get dropped while absorbing the philosophy and then are back in the side fully on! This is analogous to Herrera, Shaw and Blind last season and I think Memphis and Darmian are on similar trajectory. Of course Martial doesn't need settling time that mortals may do.

1314~~~
He's the key midfield signing this season for me. He's the balance of the team, he can play deeper, he can run, he still got a great range of passing on him and defensively he's incredibly aggressive. The way he changes direction from running towards our goal, to changing direction and breaking up a pass with a forward movement is just surreal. He reads the game so well to be able to pull that stunt off with that consistency.

1315~~~
CSKA Moscow could have turned ugly with last season 's midfield but with this badass in the side....

1316~~~
Yep. I think he took some time to get over the initial mental test from arriving at a bigger club (which was expected of course), but he's cementing his position very well now. I'm really happy to see him with us now than against us for one of our bigger rivals.

1317~~~
Seeing him boss midfield like this actually makes me angry. 

Him not starting at Arsenal is Van Gaal's worst error by a mile this season.

1318~~~
Was excellent yesterday -- our best player along with Rojo.

1319~~~
Even worse than his continual playing of Rooney? 

But yeah, it was definitely a huge error.

1320~~~
either that or shunting Martial on to the left!  

He played really well yesterday - he should be a starter for you every game.

1321~~~
Was so excited when we signed him but tbh was completely underwhelmed... until the last month or so. Been absolutely immense, first name on the team sheet in big games for me

1322~~~
Was excellent yesterday!

1323~~~
Very pleased to see him unleashing the cross field balls. He's growing in confidence.

1324~~~
If he keeps up this level of performance, he'll be our best midfielder by the time the seasons out.

1325~~~
Agreed. Started the season slowly but you can really see his confidence growing.

1326~~~
De Gea, Smalling and Schneiderlin should be the first three names on the team sheet imo.

1327~~~
I really hope with the somewhat easy fixtures coming up that he will be able to truly dominate the midfield and get into great form for the second half of the season.

1328~~~
My thoughts exactly. He can dominate the opposition.

1329~~~
Starting to find his form now and imposing himself a lot more, also showing his passing range which he wasn't doing at the start of the season.

1330~~~
I'd agree with that.

1331~~~
At Martial to that list and those 4 should automatically be on the team sheet with how important they are to the overall performances.

1332~~~
A fantastic spine to build a team around.

1333~~~
Absolutely. All very young, too.

1334~~~
Shaw too.

1335~~~
Yep we really do have a quality spine establishing themselves in the team.

1336~~~
I would agree about Martial but he is only young and don't want to burn him out.

1337~~~
Love the steel he's added to our midfield, thought he combated Palace well in there.

1338~~~
He's started to show a bit of form recently. He's probably been the standout the last few weeks.

1339~~~
I thought he started a bit slowly. Was pretty solid after that though.

1340~~~
He's our best midfielder at the moment.

1341~~~
He's played well recently, can't believe people doubted him after 2 months <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>.. I'd honest label him the most consistent player in the league in the past 2-3 years.

1342~~~
Every now and then hes making a questionable pass, other than that he's playing extremely well.

1343~~~
His contribution can't be ignored, we're defensively solid and that's thanks in turn to his fantastic holding midfield skills. 

He's totally pointless without a dynamic box to box midfielder next to him, you can't have two players that can't get up the field of play. Schweinsteiger and Carrick can't run, we need another midfielder.

1344~~~
funny how good our midfield all of a sudden look with him.. very solid nd superconsistent player who I am sure will get even better if get rid of this possession shit and try to press higher. If this happens he will win the POTY award

1345~~~
he¨s not pointless at all, we are pointless  without him, but he would certainly thrve in higher tempo game with someone with a movement at least slightly better than Zombie, I think Herrera and Schneiderlin with Mata as 10 is a good shout but Mata as 10 will never happen it seems..

1346~~~
Okay, I accept this was the wrong choice of wording, he's not pointless but playing a player of his style does mean we need a more dynamic style of play. He's been fantastic in his role, we just need to find the best option to play alongside him.

1347~~~
With that I agree. I actually get your point but sometimes I just need to corerct everything to be perfectly sure people mean it the right way. Let's try Herrera as no8 and give run out to Lingard as the second no8 which will be his better position centrally further in midfield or Pereira but he doesn't seem to cut it at Van Gaal's head no matter how well he plays... I think it's the part of the balance philosophy.. LVG would rather have someone like Akinfenwa there than creative little palyer who would be a little lightweight...

1348~~~
He certainly loses concentration sometimes for a split second and makes a sloppy pass, but he's actually better on the ball than I expected. This is probably the most he has ever been on the ball before, at Southampton he would basically intercept then play it forward as quick as possible, it's obviously a little different with us now.

1349~~~
Seen on Twitter that he's apparently injured. Anyone know anything about it?

1350~~~
He didn't always play as the DM at Southampton. He showed alot more ability on the ball there than he has for us so far, still more to come.

1351~~~
He didn't train today. Wait for the press conference for more updates.

1352~~~
Whenever Wanyama was out they switched to a 433 with Davis and Ward Prowse ahead. He can certainly play the number 4 role very well, but yes he did mainly play as a box to box.

1353~~~
feck feck feck.

1354~~~
He missed training for personal reasons.

1355~~~
As others have theorized, it might be due to bereavement. 

Hope everything is OK for him.

1356~~~
As in a family reason?

1357~~~
I believe it came out the other day that he was just sick. Hopefully that's all it was!

He's been immense for us this season and is a big reason why our defense has been so tidy to this point. Along with De Gea and Smalling, I think he's one of the most important players in our squad. Looking forward to seeing him back in the team against Watford after the break.

1358~~~
Agreed. Our defense Looks really settled - even with Shaw injured.

What a shame that our offense cannot match that Quality Standard.

1359~~~
I really like the added physicality he brings to our midfield and his composure on the ball in defensive areas today was very good.

1360~~~
Was my pick for man of the match. I thought his use of the ball was great and he was everywhere when off it.

1361~~~
Coming into some really good form!

1362~~~
Quality footballer.

1363~~~
He was a must-buy for United.

1364~~~
His off the ball work was super. Exactly what we needed.

1365~~~
I'll join the chorus, thought he was excellent today and he's slowly but surely becoming a very important player for us. Carrick's days as a starter are most definitely over.

1366~~~
He does precisely what you expect him to do.

Not a single complaint from me.

1367~~~
does the f'n job.

1368~~~
Excellent without being a stand out I like him a lot. Such a sensible buy.

1369~~~
Games like these must fill Schneiderlin with confidence, starting to play like a Makélélé and Petit hybrid. Really good blend of defensive awareness, pressing ability, stamina, commitment and physicality. Plus, his passing ability seems to progressing just fine, almost as good as his Southampton standards, which bodes well for the future as he improves even further. Really dogged presence in the center of the park, and beginning to really impose himself on the opposition rather than being passive like he was at the start of his United career.

1370~~~
Fantastic again today, he adds the steel that our midfield has needed for years. He, de gea and smalling are the 3 permanents on the team sheet in my eyes IMO, he really is that important too us.

1371~~~
MoM for me. Again.

1372~~~
Great signing.....

1373~~~
Ability on the ball has improved greatly

1374~~~
Him and Bastian are a huge part of our defensive improvement.

1375~~~
Excellent at breaking up play! Mastered the art of little inconspicuous fouls.

1376~~~
He's almost entering Lucas like territory with his ability to commit numerous fouls, and not get booked. 

It must be his beautiful face, and that big French grin that the refs just can't resist. Feck knows how Lucas used to get away with it mind.

1377~~~
Thought he was your best player today, he's very good at slide tackles.

1378~~~
Improves every game, vital signing.

1379~~~
This, seems to growing in confidence as the season progresses.

1380~~~
Important role today. It was a real battle in that midfield and he really got stuck in. Great performance after what would have been a very tough week for the guy.

1381~~~
The perception of Schneiderlin is bizarre. That was one of our worst midfield performances of the season and a perfect example of what we lack when Carrick's not there. He was the reason it became a "battle". Even van Gaal said we didn't play well in possession. Schneiderlin's job is to help us dominate the game and control the midfield, not to make lots of tackles.

1382~~~
Well, it's both really. He's a defensive midfielder. When we don't have the ball, it's his job to stop the opposition. He did that. Schneiderlin isn't the tempo setter in the midfield. It should have been Schweinsteiger. We would have controlled the game with ease if not for injuries, as the 4-2-2-2 we started with was tearing them apart.

It was a turbulent game, we turned up with no centre forwards. An injury somehow made the manager completely change the shape and dynamic of the team to a system we've not played for ages, and disrupted a defence which looked very comfortable. Then we had to make a 2nd defensive change with a player who hasn't played for ages. To expect us still dominate the game and hog the ball in those circumstances is asking a lot, especially when Watford had nothing to lose but to throw everything at us. In spite of that, Schneiderlin's work off the ball was very good. As much as I like Carrick, I don't think he would have done the dirty work Schneiderlin did today.

1383~~~
Was suprised with the low rating he got from todays match I thought he was our best midfilder by some margin but i guess the 5 great minutes from Bastian who was pretty poor for the rest of the game is more valuable then a 90 minute good and disciplined performance from a more defensive player.

1384~~~
We controlled the first half just fine, it was when we switched too a defensive formation we lost our footing. It was never a problem through the middle either, all of Watfords Attacks came with overlaps down the flanks. 

He had a great game in my eyes.

1385~~~
He was very good in possession, though. Used it incredibly wisely in and amongst tight situations. A lot more so than Bastian, who was sloppy. 

Our midfield was a little isolated with the change of formation. Herrera is a lot better at dropping into midfield than Mata.

Carrick would have fell foul to the very same issues, minus the crucial break up play.

1386~~~
Our most underrated player at the moment. Our midfield is rock solid with him in it, excellent purchase he is proving to be.

1387~~~
Schweinsteiger was the bigger problem. I agree that our passing wasn't good enough, but Schneiderlin lost the ball a lot less than Schweinsteiger.

1388~~~
It might have been one of the worst midfield performances of the season (after Herrera went off and the formation changed), but that wasn't down to Schneiderlin, and I have no idea how you've come to the conclusion that it was. When the game develops the way it did, his job literally becomes "make lots of tackles".

1389~~~
Compare his stats to Schweinsteiger. 

Morgan wasn't great but what's really bizarre is singling that out as one of our worst midfield performances of the season when it wasn't even our worst midfield performance of this weekend.

1390~~~
Obviously because Schneiderlin played quite a few awful passes and didn't help us controlling the game in the second half. Also in terms of making a lot of tackles; according to whoscored he made 2 and according to squawka he made 1. His success rate was 13% leading to 5 fouls. He can definitely do better in that regard.

1391~~~
It was acually lots of interceptions (6) and thats part of controlling the midfield.

1392~~~
I think he meant that as a whole our midfield was bad rather than singling out Schneiderlin.

1393~~~
Indeed. You can judge attackers by their individual contribution but you tend to judge midfielders and defenders on their contribution to the collective. Praising a centre mids performance individually in a game that we obviously struggled in midfield collectively doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.

I think Schneiderlin's a good player but he's been a part of many poor midfield performances (and subsequently most of our poor results). Yet in here he generally gets nothing but praise. I don't really understand that disconnect. Conspicuous player in poor midfield performances = lots of praise, inconspicuous player in good midfield performances = lots of criticism.

I agree, Schweinstiger was much worse. He was appropriately criticised for that. I don't think Schneiderlin was particularly worthy of criticism but it's the fact he gets praised for playing a part in such a poor midfield performance that's bizarre.

1394~~~
I was speaking generally about the tackling, btw. I agree he didn't do an amazing job with that today, but it was in response too the claim that his job isn't "to make lots of tackles". My main point of contention was him being thrown under the bus when he had to pick up Bastian's slack.

Strangely, his objectively "worst" performances have been in games where we've won, whilst his better performances are usually when we do poorly and he's playing next to a struggling Schweinsteiger.

I don't think it's bizarre to praise a player for doing a good job under difficult circumstances.

1395~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> omg, classy again

his job is different to what carrick does, you need to understand that. Carrick would struggle after that change of formation when we put a player from midfield to defense. Today it was classic Schneiderlin performance, who just dominated midfield his own way, breaking the play really well, not letting them a single opening. There wasn't much space to handle the ball better today, they were pressing high and its been a long time we played 5 defenders and two strikers, hence the job for midfielders become tougher. 

He didn't really standout for me today but he did his usual standard well. To call it the worst midfield performance of the season is either overraction or perhaps the lack of football knowledge. It's a bit of both I guess. He's easily the best buy of the summer, maybe on par with the other frenchman.

1396~~~
The way the game unfolded, it required that type of performance. It wasn't a pretty game, so expecting Carrick type of control over a game like that is a little harsh.

1397~~~
Do you think that's strange? I think it's illuminating. If he plays well when we don't play well then perhaps what he does well isn't actually that important or even beneficial to the team. People might like seeing it but that's deceptive. People say Carrick couldn't have done what he did and I agree - but he wouldn't have had to. He's covered for Schweinstiger's poor performances on the ball and helped us dominate the midfield regardless.

It's setting the bar extremely low if we're saying "well, we lost control of the midfield, and in that scenario he did well to get stuck in and battle away". We should be expecting him to wrestle back control of the midfield. That's his role. Defending well is part of that but not the extent of it.

How many games have we been found lacking in when he hasn't played? He offers all of these things like bite, energy, defensive protection etc. but how many times has us "lacking" that really hindered the team? Very rarely, in my view. 

We keep a clean sheet in ~50% of our games with or without him so I don't think we can say any of the above really translates into better defensive performances. We could say it translates to unquantifiable things like midfield dominance and leave it there, but I just think his influence is being vastly overstated. I think that's mostly because he fits the profile of the kind of player so many people have wanted since Keane retired, so just by his style of play alone he wins praise.

1398~~~
He is just absolutely everywhere every single game. 

Such an integral part of us controlling games and keeping everything settled.

1399~~~
Carrick hasn't dominated the midfield this season, however. He's had one game worthy of his, let's say 12/13 form, which was against Moscow at home. Aside from that he's faded into the backdrop, a long term product of partnering him with a partner of equal/more experience and responsibility.

All statistics point to Carrick being pivotal to this United side and our results, but on the basis of his actual performances, which have been objectively poorer than Schneiderlin's on the whole, I think it's a baffling case of immense coincidence. I refer to last season, too.

As for the final question you pose. The lack of bite and defensive protection was most noticeable in that game against Arsenal at the Emirates. We wouldn't have conceded three goals in twenty minutes with Schneiderlin in the midfield. Infact, we haven't conceded three with him on the field at any point in his short time here. 

Your general assertion that the Schneiderlin-Schweinsteiger duo is a contributer to our weakest midfield performances is one I simply disagree completely on the whole. I think they're the most balanced and energetic pair by far.

1400~~~
The Arsenal game, where we lacked a defensive presence infront of the back four, and got absolutely twatted.

I'm not saying he alone would have rescued a result, but the general consensus on that day from fans and pundits was that we needed him, or a player performing a role like he does, in the centre of midfield. Schweinsteiger played quite an advanced/box to box role that day (or tried to), and Carrick got totally dominated, because he's not a out and out defensive midfielder like Schneiderlin is.

He also didn't play in the PSV game, and they started to cut us open once Shaw went off. So, two of our three losses this season, Schneiderlin didn't play. Nor did he play when we got knocked out of the cup, when Boro could have won it normal time with the chances they had.


IMO, Schneiderlin has been a significant part of our excellent defensive record this season.

1401~~~
I'd like to know what makes you so sure that Schneiderlin has been objectively better if his presence in the team hasn't resulted in better results or better performances. It's all well and good saying Carrick has just coincidentally played in winning teams but surely you have an explanation for why Schneiderlin hasn't been part of well performing teams in the majority of his appearances despite "objectively" playing well?

I agree - Schneiderlin would've helped in the Arsenal game. Though that's the only game you can point to then it suggests he's not quite that critical. On the flipside we can point to an inability to score on multiple occasions with him in the team...and I think there's every reason to believe that's not just coincidental, IMO.

1402~~~
I just think he's generally played better individually. His work rate is outstanding, he's crucial to our much improved pressing game and his passing has been greatly improved of late - after an iffy start. I think he stamps more authority on the game than Carrick and is better on the ball under pressure. This season, anyway. 

I approach the debate from a position of weakness because we so obviously see better results with Carrick on the field. But I don't think we get better performances. 

Even if you analyse the dropped points when without Carrick, if you pick the games apart on an individual basis then you'd see that Romero played a dud in the defeat to Swansea, Rooney couldn't hit a barn door in the draw against Newcastle, and although we dropped points to City at home, our midfield was superior to theirs. Carrick didn't play (I think) and we didn't win those games. Was that because of his absence? I'm not so sure.

I thought this last season, too, for what it's worth. The stats dictated that he was important to us, but I was rarely greatly impressed with him. 

I don't think Schneiderlin is to blame for our lack of goals. I don't think any of the midfielders are, to be honest.

1403~~~
I thought his energy and determination was excellent. He made some good interceptions and tackles too. However I didn't rate him too highly because we really did struggle to control the midfield at times, and that was partly down to him.

1404~~~
Are you sure you are criticising the right player there? Seems to me you are criticising the role Schneiderlin is playing. Would you say the same of Coquelin? It's a bit odd to downplay what Schneiderlin does for us, considering he's doing what he's supposed to do and what he was bought for, while neither Carrick nor Schweinsteiger have been as good as they've been in their roles in the past. I'm fairly sure Wenger highly appreciates what Coquelin does for his team and that it enables Cazorla to play as well as he has. Especially when you consider the experience Carrick and Schweinsteiger have, it's confusing to be as forgiving as you are for their performances, whilst ignoring that Schneiderlin is very much new to this kind of level or club.

1405~~~
You seem hellbent on discrediting Schneiderlin, and I'm not sure if you genuinely don't like or if you're just being contrarian. It's natural for a player like Schneiderlin to fade in games where we are in control, but he's usually key to us maintaining that control thanks to his excellent workrate and tireless running.

The games where Carrick's been on the bench and we've had a poor result haven't been the sort of games where having Carrick on would have solved anything, as Kag rightly points out. And you're vastly overrating Carrick's ability to impose himself on games (on current form, at least). And I don't think praising him for doing a good job winning the wall and for his defensive workrate is setting the bar low, given the he's primarily a defensive midfielder who was primarily bought for his abilities as such. If we're relying on him to take on the role of playmaker as well, then his midfield partner isn't doing his job.

I seriously can't wrap my head around the line of thinking that leads giving Morgan shit for not doing enough to help control the midfield when his partner is the one who's actually playing poorly. It's completely devoid of any logic.

Your only post in the Schweinsteiger-thread is praising him for his reaction after the goal, but you go out of your way to shit all over Schneiderlin. It reeks of an (and this is a word that gets thrown around a lot on here these days, and that I (personally) don't use lightly) agenda.

1406~~~
I think he's underappreciated and he quietly goes about his job without making too many ripples. You could have said the same about Carrick for a good few years before people realised how critical he was to us.

1407~~~
I honestly have no idea what it is he actually does or is supposed to do aside from running around. Schweinstiger has been shit as well but he does have a good pass or two on him once in a while and I can sort of see why he's in the team. Also, for someone who's supposed to be good defensively, he gets caught out of position an awful lot. You can criticize all of Herrera/Carrick/Schweinstiger but their quality is there for all to see. Schneiderlin just looks bang average.

1408~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1409~~~
The kind of game he was bought for. Some really good tackles and interceptions to win possession/break-up their attack. I really wish he had more quality in attack, its almost like he plays well within himself when we're on the ball.

1410~~~
Great argument. Well made.

No half decent DM should find himself chasing the play back as often as he does. Something Fellaini (quite rightly) got lots of stick for.

1411~~~
That (a few) people can't actually recognise the stratospheric improvement of the United midfield, and just how well the players in there are playing to dominate games like we do, is frightening. 

Our midfield is an actual, proper midfield. You know, one that passes the ball to those ahead of them, keeps the game ticking, presses the opposition and actively wins the ball back. I think it's the best, most functional midfield in the division. Schneiderlin is a big reason why.

1412~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1413~~~
Agreed. Based on what we've seen so far, his role clearly seems to be one that mainly concerns breaking up play and shielding the back four. Yesterday's game made that pretty obvious. What I like about him most is that besides tackling the crap out of every opposition player, he's also very strong technically. His first touch is great, he doesn't even seem to feel the pressure of players closing in on him. He's been a breath of fresh air in a team that usually excels at losing the ball in midfield.

Others feel contempt with criticizing him for not offering enough when going forward, but I think that's harsh. His role in the side means that he barely even tries to go forward. Maybe that'll change with time, and I'm confident that he'd adapt well if asked to do so.

I don't know if I'd describe our midfield as the <i>best in the division, </i>but it's arguably up there, and it's definitely miles ahead of anything that we've been accustomed to over the past few years.

1414~~~
Yep. What have Michael Carrick and Bastian Schweinstiger ever done but lose the ball in midfield? What would they ever know of dominating games from midfield or providing defensive protection? feck knows how they managed to be mainstays for teams that have repeatedly reached European finals in he last decade.

1415~~~
He is the best DM in the league. "Bang average" pfft

1416~~~
I think he's had a massive impact on our midfield, and the biggest impact for me is how our midfield no longer gets easily overrun, especially in the big games.

Even under Fergie especially in the later years, midfield perfomances like the one against Arsenal happened frequently, where our midfield simply couldnt cope. Think of the perfomances against City and Chelsea away in 12/3, we won both but they really did dominate us badly.

They are obviously a lot of Carrick fans here, but the honest truth is that LVG gave him a chance earlier in the season , and he didnt really impress, and thats why he was dropped.

Carrick and Schneiderlin doesnt really work as we saw earlier in the season , while BFs and Carrick lack the mobility  and pressing required esp against high energy midfields. For me, a Schneiderlin and BFS are our best combo, complemented by Herrera at 10, allowing him to drop into midfield and provide support.It appears that the Schmiedfield is Van Gaal's favoured combination too.

1417~~~
I can see why you think it's an agenda but you've got the wrong end of the stick. I wasn't being contrarian for the sake of it, I just thought the overwhelmingly positivity in this thread after such a poor midfield performance collectively was very odd. I was in agreement with the vast majority of supporters in the summer that signing Schneiderlin is a no brainer. Coquelin and Matic are the only players that have played at a similar or higher level in the past couple of years, and Schneiderlin has sustained that form for a longer period than them both so could well be described as the best DM in the league. I think he's done a good job for us this season and I'm really happy we have him here. I just think people set the bar low for him. If we're relying on his partner to be playing well in every game just to allow us to control the midfield then we're giving Schneiderlin a very easy ride. He should be expected to step up and play the leading role in midfield when his partner is subpar. It's what all of our best midfielders have done, Carrick included - many, many times. He can do so much more.

1418~~~
I think you need new glasses. I literally cannot understand how you can't see what he brings, apart from "running around". 

Yes his attacking game could improve and I think the more he settles in this team he will get more risky and confident, but defensively he is fantastic. Makes so many good interceptions, tackles, and covers the ground well. The 352 formation with Mata ahead asks way too much of the centre midfielders, they basically have to help the wingback when they are being overlapped, it causes way too much confusion.

1419~~~
I thought he was crucial yesterday. He did have a great game if you look at the highlights but he ensured that we never lost the physical battle or shape once Watford pressed. It was a lot of off the ball work and crucial interceptions and tackling.

1420~~~
Putting words in someone else's mouth. That's a new one.

Have you watched any United games this season? Carrick has on many occasions lost the ball in midfield, especially when under pressure. I've always been a huge advocate for Carrick, and I still think he has a key role to play in our midfield, especially with regards to playing the ball forward. This point combined with the one that I said in my previous post are not mutually exclusive.

Don't know why you've even mentioned Basti dominating midfields in his playing career, the argument concerned Manchester United over the past few years, not Bayern Munich. Then again steaming off track is much easier than actually trying to make sense.
Everyone has an opinion, I get that. I just think your points are way off the mark.

1421~~~
It's incredible!

1422~~~
He makes our backbone very strong. Along with De Gea and Smalling, they've improved our defense massively, this season.

1423~~~
I'm not talking about his attacking game. His general passing needs an improvement for a start as does his all round awareness. That's not too much to expect from the supposedly the best DM in the league. People talk about our excellent defensive record but ignore the number of times throughout the season runners have just breezed past our midfield only to be thwarted by De Gea or Smalling. And I'm not talking about yesterday's game though again he was average as usual but the season in general. Just because he runs about and puts in a few good tackles doesn't mean he's been good.

Putting words in your mouth? You said and I quote "He's been a breath of fresh air in a team that usually excels at losing the ball in midfield." In what world is that remotely true? Gross exaggeration at best and that's being kind. Carrick has not been his usual self this season but he's hardly been shit either. His performance against Liverpool was better than anything Schneiderlin has put up this season. I understand Carrick is usually the go to man when people want to have a pop at our midfield but this is getting silly.

I mentioned Schweinstiger and Carrick for a simple reason. These are two players who are not only very good defensively but are excellent with the ball as well. Yet, it's Schneiderlin's ability to not lose the ball that's been a 'breath of fresh air'.

1424~~~
If you don't see the irony in your own posts then I honestly don't think there's much reason to keep at this.

I'll just say exactly what I meant once more. For me, Schneiderlin has been a <i>breath of fresh air</i> in a midfield that over the past few years has looked nothing like a midfield, bar Carrick (for some reason you still think I have this morbid agenda against Carrick). I don't think Carrick has been anywhere near shit this season, if anything he's the midfielder that's offered most when going forward. His ability to play accurate balls to our forward line without even looking is immense. Still, he's repeatedly lost the ball in midfield when under pressure, something that Scheiderlin has been able to handle more comfortably.

FYI I think Basti's been a <i>breath of fresh air </i>too. <img alt=":wenger:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie6" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Wenger    :wenger:"/>

1425~~~
Games like yesterday are exactly the types of games over the years where Carrick wouldve been criticised for being overrun (whilst he was on his own in the middle of the park). 

The reality is there will always be games in the premiership when you need to roll up your sleeves and get the job done. That's what Schneiderlin did yesterday. And that's been a small criticism of Carrick, and I'm a Carrick fan, in that when the going got tough Carrick didn't always assert himself.

1426~~~
That's fair enough although I disagree with the bit in bold. It's not like Schneiderlin hasn't lost the ball in midfield at all.

IMO Schneiderlin has been massively overrated based on his performances so far. I was expecting a lot more. Maybe that will come in time as he adjusts to playing for a big club.

1427~~~
Makes some clever fouls too
Usually just mild enough to get away without a card
He will get booked and sent off but it's great having midfield aggression 
Super player

1428~~~
I know, which is why I said <i>more comfortably </i>and not <i>at all</i>.

Fair enough for the rest.

1429~~~
Runners doesn't breeze past our midfield at will. Certainly not on anything like a regular basis. That's fiction.

1430~~~
He's been great and has added a much needed solidity to our midfield. Arguably our best new signing alongside Martial.

Goes about his job simply and effectively.

1431~~~
I thought our lack of control in midfield yesterday was down to a) the ridiculous change to 3-5-2 and b) The shocking performance from Bastian

1432~~~
At 25/26, would you say he's a better player than Carrick when he was the same age?

1433~~~
Carrick was a far superior player, it's not even close.

I like Schneiderlin a lot - he was my number 1 pick for signing we should have made this summer - but I've not been left pretty underwhelmed by him so far. He's playing far too within himself currently.

1434~~~
I think the reason some people don't appreciate him right now is more down to our style of play and the role the other midfielder alongside him is playing. I am not sure a current day Schweinsteiger is the ideal partner for him because he likes to play deep as well. I feel that if we had a box to box player like Herrera alongside him then we would probably be more attacking team but LVG tends to focus more on control. Overall though we are very secure through the middle and don't get run over much so it's silly to suggest that Schneiderlin has been bang average.

1435~~~
We have (mostly) been secure (though it's not like teams don't get onto our back four a fair bit - look at how much defending Smalling has had to do, and why he's looked so excellent this season) - but considering in the majority of the games we have the ball a lot - to expect our midfielders to be just as good on the ball as they are off it is not unreasonable, and in that regard, Schneiderlin really has not imposed himself onto games / deferred to the person next to him far too often for my liking.

1436~~~
He's rarely out of position, if ever

1437~~~
If the person next to me was bastian schweinsteiger id be deferring the ball to him a lot too. There's no point in schneiderlin trying to be something he's not, if we wanted a brilliant ball player we would have signed gundogan or we'd be playing Herrera there more often. We signed schneiderlin to break up play and solidify our team which is exactly what he's doing. That's why arsenal have coquelin, city have Fernandinho, Liverpool have Lucas and Chelsea have Matic. Every quality team needs these players and we can't criticise him for being something that he isn't.

1438~~~
<a class="username" data-user="34496, @Brwned" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/34496/">@Brwned</a> I think it's pretty clear that Schneiderlin at the moment is not quite up there in terms of his quality on the ball. He's still a great addition because we haven't had his sort of tackling midfielder for awhile, and all our three in the middle being capable of defending has contributed to our defensive record, but I do agree that he doesn't put in complete performances, and plays it very safe, and could do a lot more in this regard.

But then again I've not seen much of that from him to expect it at this stage to be honest. Hopefully as he grows in his United career he starts to express himself more on the ball and take a bit more responsibility in that respect.

But overall I'm happy with his performances. Even if he's limiting his contribution to certain aspects they are important aspects and he's executing them well.

1439~~~
Remember when not that long ago, United's midfield was non-existent? At least, defensively, more often than not? 

I am glad United have the likes of Schmidfield now, one to break-up play and one to control/manage the midfield. So refreshing to see.

1440~~~
I'd like him to swap positions with Schweinsteiger, with Bastian as the quarterback in a deeper position. Schneiderlin should press forward and try to win the ball deeper in the opposition half because he's also got the legs/pace to get back quicker.

1441~~~
I'd agree with this. I thought Schneiderlin was good on Saturday, used the ball well too which has been my biggest criticism this season. Not been showing the quality on the ball he has at the start of the season but certainly been doing that in the past month or so.

1442~~~
I fully agree. Even Carrick did that with Scholes and Carrick's passing used to be brilliant. It's clear that if you have a Scholes, Pirlo type of player next to you you leave that part mainly to him. Schneiderlin's main job is a different one. I critisized him at the beginning for not being good enough with/on the ball but recently he showed improvement.

1443~~~
Worst performance in a United shirt. Absolutely woeful.

1444~~~
Yep, did nothing of note defensively(at least I didn't notice much), and absolutely nothing attacking wise.

1445~~~
Was good in the first half, absolutely terrible 2nd.

1446~~~
Slightly knee jerk because I've just had to witness that horrendous performance, but given the way he was hyped up by the caf I've been fairly disappointed with him so far. He is a woeful passer of the ball, even on a good day. I'm hoping he'll improve significantly over time anyway.

1447~~~
His worst performance for us by a distance. Terrible in that second half, kept giving the ball away or just passing back to Smalling or lumping it pointlessly. Him and Fellaini our 2 worst today IMO.

1448~~~
Why he wasn't withdrawn instead of Schweinsteiger I will never know, looks a little bit out of his depth in Europe.

1449~~~
he had a great first half but really poor second, what the hell actully happened in the heads of all players after the halftime... we were actually trying to rotate rooney and fellini somehow in midfield, instead of putting on another playmaker in pereira who is twice footbller thn the two mentioned we just end up with this shit. But schneiderlin should defo do better in the second half, it lmost looked like he didnt care, thts when cptin should come and have his words with players.

we will get thrashed by leicester on the weekend

1450~~~
He was absolutely horrific tonight. Unbelievably bad, missing tackles, terrible passing, he even missed a couple of half decent chances.

It's only Fellaini playing tonight that didn't make him the worst player on the pitch.

1451~~~
He was very poor. Ridiculously non-committal on the ball and just constantly wanted to make simple passes back to defence. Smalling and Blind were creating a lot more whenever they hit a long ball, or burst forward, then he was.

1452~~~
becuse he was clealry much better till that..

1453~~~
Terrible today

1454~~~
For a defensive mid to be giving the ball away in his own half under no pressure is criminal.

1455~~~
He played well in the first half, but his legs had clearly gone in the second. It's a bit concerning that our players are flagging already and it's not even December yet. Our thin squad may be our undoing this season.

1456~~~
Schweinsteiger was marginally worse. His legs have gone. He can't play two games in quick succession. As soon as he went off Schneiderlin fell to bits completely but there was no way Schweinsteiger should or could have played the full 90.

1457~~~
Had a very poor second half but he was really good in the first 45. Yes he was awful in that last half hour but I think people are being unfair saying he was the worst on the pitch and ignoring his good first half.

1458~~~
Made me do a bit of sick in my mouth the number of times he played 5 yard passes to PSV players in the last half hour.  Was he pissed?

1459~~~
That has become much more obvious (to me at least) since Carrick's injury. Schweinsteiger is being forced to play more minutes than he's capable of.

1460~~~
I agree. His play is far too frustrating, predictable and disappointing from an offensive contribution point of view.

1461~~~
Yeah I suppose you are right, god knows how we're going to get through the Christmas period.

1462~~~
Like Schweinsteiger, he has been underwhelming so far. We thought we had our midfield fixed when we signed these lot.

1463~~~
Lets be generous and call it one game too many this week.

1464~~~
He was asked to be a one-man midfield.

Fine in the first half, knackered and poor form the moment Schweini went off. Too much space to cover.

1465~~~
This is the problem with schneiderlin constantly deferring to Schweinsteiger. Soon as Bastian went off, he was lost.

He has absolutely no ability to control games

1466~~~
It is incredibly frustrating how long he spends on the ball deciding who to pass too... Say what you want about Carrick, but at least he knows what he wants to do with the ball as soon as he gets it

1467~~~
He was shite, but our attackers hung him out to dry. 

Rooney decided he had no interest in receiving the ball off of him whatsoever. 

It was clear after about eight minutes that he was screaming for runners to drop short.

1468~~~
He was dire, but honestly what did he have to pass too? The movement off the ball in this side is pathetic.

Look at the amount of lovely one touch passes PSV played tonight.

1469~~~
He was poor, but I feel sorry for him being paired with Fellaini in midfield. If Pereira had been brought on I don't doubt that it would have raised Scheniderlin's levels.

1470~~~
Too many passes either backwards, sidewards or to an opponent. He's better than that.

1471~~~
Diabolical in the last half hour.

1472~~~
Imploded in the second half.

1473~~~
Even worse when he then just ends up passing it back to defence.

1474~~~
This.

1475~~~
Had a shocker but at least he keeps showing for the ball.

Also he's involved in so much that he can't cruise through games. He's either great or shite.

1476~~~
Is he?  I mean, really, is he?  Based on what evidence?  

Does not look like a top elite midfielder to me, more like a mid ranking journey man.

1477~~~
Really not very good at this passing lark, is he? Great at winning the ball back, and works well next to Carrick (or BFS usually), but his range of passing isn't what you'd expect. Decent short passes, fairly poor medium to long range passes. Ball retention isn't his strong point.

1478~~~
Like he was playing on Valium towards the end.

Started very well pinging it forward. Finished the game much worse than anything he's put up before.

I'll cut him some slack as been one of our stand-out performers of late but that was shit.

1479~~~
Stats:

2 shots.
1 on target.
1 off target.
76/91 passes.
15 failed passes. At least 8 were long passes.
83.5% pass completion.
0/1 crosses.
0/1 take ons.
9 ball recoveries.
1/7 tackles.
3 interception.
2 clearance.

1480~~~
He was shite, but no worse than Memphis or Schweinsteiger.

Guardado showed him how a midfield should be run, and Hendrix/ Propper had the Schmidfield shackled comfortably.

1481~~~
That's what really stood out today. His passing is always hit or miss but 1/7 tackles is shocking for him, he's usually much better in that area. In the second half players were walking past him with the ball.

1482~~~
Played alright first half and hit a few nice diagonals but turned to sh*t in the second and became increasingly sloppy.

1483~~~
Terrible 2nd half from him

1484~~~
He was very sloppy in the second half. I haven't really been impressed with his input for us so far, he has just been decent and nothing more.

1485~~~
His passing in the first 30 minutes was good but he was as poor as I've seen him in 2 years defensively and started to make more mistakes as the game went on.

1486~~~
Unfortunately he had a bit of a 'mare, particularly late in the second-half. He started decently and looked a lot better alongside Bastian. Really needed it to be Carrick who was next to him late in the game rather than Fellaini/Rooney. I think he'll bounce back alright though and this was just a one off.

1487~~~
Must have had about twenty failed tackle attempts in that game. In truth he's disappointed me a little since joining, he's another one of these players who appears to have joined the big club and been overawed by it.

1488~~~
The reason he suddenly got worse is because he was forced to play like a proper midfielder when Schweinsteiger went off, and he failed. Schweinsteiger still plays like a proper midfielder even when he's playing poorly. Schneiderlin struggles to even when he's playing well.

1489~~~
He looked like he was carrying an injury.

1490~~~
I was genuinely shocked by just how bad he became when Schweinsteiger came off. I've criticised him off this season for deferring to/hiding from either Carrick or Schweinsteiger too much, but I didn't envisage it would be THAT bad without them.

I was already pretty annoyed by just how laboured he was on the ball in the first half (and the fact that at times he was hitting some very nice long passes just infuriated me more - because he's capable/has the skill to do it... he just either a) doesn't have the confidence to do it regularly and b) takes an absolute age to decide where he's going to pass the ball)... The second half took it to new levels though.

1491~~~
what a nonsense, sweinsteigger was the worst player on the pitch in the first half and should have been subbed off after half time..Schneiderlin ws on the other hnd our best player with lingard, exellent positionally, missed timed just one tackle but was literlly everywhere.. something went wrong when fellaini nd rooney when to midfield nd tried to interchange places, its not only schneiderlins fult how we plyed but his second hlf performnce was going from bad to worse while as I said belonged to our best players in the first half but people like you have short memories or lack footbll knowledge to judge players objectively not based on one half of game but again its you <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

1492~~~
I wonder if a less risk-averse or more Bielsa/Guardiola type manager would have taken Smalling off, played Schneiderlin at CB and given us better passing from deep to better pick apart and pin back PSV. 

As for his performance, he started very well then got worse over the course of the game. Still, promising stuff. Looks better than he did most of October and I'm mostly over the fears I was starting to develop that he might just not be good enough on the ball to be a starter here.

1493~~~
His performance suddenly dropped, not sure what really happened there

1494~~~
Schneiderlin was absolutely knackered, if anything, we should have moved Blind further and subbed Darmian off way earlier.

1495~~~
He was terrible in both halves. It became more noticable when Van Gaal decided it would be a good idea to replace Schweinsteiger with Fellaini...a top midfielder playing well would struggle with Fellaini as a midfield partner in a CL game. Schneiderlin was struggling to play simple passes even vaguely near their intended target and arriving about 3 seconds late to every loose ball.

To be honest he was so bad the blame actually lies 90% with the manager for not doing anything at all about it...and then 100% with the manager for making a change that would very obviously make the problem a lot worse.

1496~~~
Shocking 2nd half last night. Didn't look on it at all and repeatedly looked flat footed and unsure of what he was at.

1497~~~
Yeah, his second half performance was undoubtedly a lot worse than his first half one, but I didn't think he did all that much in the opening stages of the game either, which he seemed to be getting a bit of praise for. Even if anyone would struggle beside Fellaini though, I'd have still expected some more creative passing from Schneiderlin who only looked remotely comfortable when making simple passes back to Smalling or Blind.

1498~~~
Yeah. He had a terrible game. Looks like half the player he was at Southampton (hmmm... i wonder if he told a journalist something similar?)

1499~~~
If he did, he probably mulled over it for ages... weighed up all the options available, thought about not saying anything... but then eventually, when he decided he'd tell the journalist, give him a really watered down version of what he thinks.

1500~~~
Even in the first half I thought he looked noticably off the pace...he definitely got worse but his passing was really bad all night and he kept selling himself in the middle. He's had some decent games and some terrible ones so far. Last night was the first time he just looked plainly out of his depth.
I'd have thought he was one of the few players who LVG's methods would suit, but it is probably hard for any player when the team as a whole isn't comfortable with what it is being asked to do.

It's the same this season as last, if you go through our squad, the number of players LVG seems to hinder vastly outweighs the number who seem to benefit...which is particularly annoying since he bought about two thirds of them.

1501~~~
Heh. I hear you. Makes me sad though. He was nothing like this under that other Dutch manager <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1502~~~
He's been bang average so far in his United career despite the best attempts to either make out like he's been very good or deflect attention by blaming either Carrick or Schweinstiger or our attack for him being shit defensively and getting caught out of position. Very very disappointing so far given how hyped up he was.

feck knows how we're 2nd in the table with 90% of our team being either bang average or outright dogshite.

1503~~~
Another very weak PL season but you're giving United too little credit. Points still should be grinded out and United has been effective in that so far in the PL.

1504~~~
You're spot on. I remember you were critical of him after the Watford game but got laid into on here.

He's not overly keen to request the ball and spends too much time in line with our centrebacks for no apparent reason, which means one less option to pass forwards for them. Theres no incision to his passes, they're are either short sideways passes or long passes. He's also started to ruin our midfield overloads when our CBs steps up, by running back to fill their position.

Last night reminded me a lot of his Wolfsburg at home performance. Deferred to Schweinsteiger all game, hid from the pass and then when Schweinsteiger went off, our midfield fell apart. It was overlooked on here but I think it played a big part in LvG opting not to play Schneiderlin in the following game against Arsenal. Sure it was a bad call in hindsight but I understood the reasoning behind dropping him.

He's good defensively, largely due to him being strong and mobile but he really needs smarten up and assert himself when we have the ball too.

1505~~~
His worst game for us so far. I'm a big fan of him, but he looked soft last night, when he's normally rock solid. So many times, the opposition just stepped through him with the ball. There was one instance in the 2nd half where he just did some sort of back-flick with the ball when he had all the time in the world to bring it under control, but he just sliced it back to the opposition, and we didn't get the ball back for ages.

It was playground stuff. Really lazy. It looked like he'd had enough by the hour mark and was already on the bus home.

To give him a little bit of the benefit of the doubt, the midfield as a mess last night. The worst it has been this season. Rooney didn't seem interested in linking midfield to attack. Schweinsteiger was pushing on to try and make things happen, but it gave Schneiderlin very little option when he had the ball. In the 2nd half when he had Rooney and Fellaini around him, Schneiderlin was almost a 1 man midfield, and he looked totally shot. But it doesn't explain why even early in the game the opposition just walked through him at times.

1506~~~
He looked absolutely knackered too me, some of the under hit and loose passes showed that.

1507~~~
lack of rotation can't be used as an excuse for him. He has played 15 out of 21 games. It's pretty reasonable to expect him to cope with that.

1508~~~
He's been our best midfielder ever since the Arsenal game.

He had a shocker yesterday though, he just didn't look at the races. Was second best to everything, and his passing was terrible. Not really sure what happened. Saying that, I doubt its much fun being a midfielder in LVG's system, just ask Herrera.

1509~~~
I don't think it's an excuse, of course their fitness should be up too it but the whole team looked the same way. I think his concentration levels took a dive and looked a yard off the pace, especially in the 2nd half. That came from tiredness IMO.

1510~~~
Agree with some posters in here, he seems to shrink when the going gets tough. I don't think that he has the mentality to ever kick on and become world class.

1511~~~
Well, given that Herrera for some weird reason never plays CM anymore, Carrick has barely played since Arsenal and Schweinstiger has been shit, it's not saying much. Being slightly better than shit still makes you shit and at least Bastian he does have a couple of good moments per game.

1512~~~
From what I read this summer, he's wasted just holding midfield. 

How much fun would it be to watch him and Herrera play box-to-box as a pair? <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1513~~~
I have thought of this. the modern day Keane and Scholes.

Except Morgan is a poor man's Keane. Herrera is about pretty good.

1514~~~
What's to play like a proper midfielder?

1515~~~
He played quite well in the first half and absolutely collapsed in the second. He wasn't the only one though. It was a shambles in the second half.

He's been better in recent weeks but having watched him so far this season, he doesn't look good enough on the ball to play in midfield for United. He reminds me of Owen Hargreaves but not as good defensively.

1516~~~
Look at who's top and you've got your answer. It's a shit league and it's there for the taking.

1517~~~
'Being slightly better then shit'? What are you on about? He's been in great form up until yesterday.

1518~~~
I don't get it, either. He's a defensive midfielder who's been doing the job of a defensive midfielder very well, but for whatever reason some just think he's shit. They expect him to take on the job as playmaker whenever his partner falters, and if he can't keep that midfield ticking on his own while his partner is having a shocker, then he clearly isn't good enough.

1519~~~
Or because his midfield partner went from Schweinsteger to Rooney with Fellaini as a 10? Hardly surprising we lost control once those changes were made.  Schneiderlin is a superb DM but clearly needs to be partnered correctly. He's a defensive MF specialist ala Matic.

When we signed him there was a few 10minute youtube highlight fans who kept claiming he was box to box and that seems to have stuck, there's plenty of top european teams that operate without a "proper" midfielder.

1520~~~
I fecking hope not. If that's Schneiderlin being in great form, that's another 25m down the drain.

1521~~~
I just don't think he's technically that good. The majority of posters on here probably only saw him when he was highlighted in the media and it gave a skewed outlook of what he's actually capable of. His performance against Man City in particular, where he made Yaya Toure look like Kolo Toure, was one that was highlighted as how great a player he was. In truth not only was that probably his best ever game in a So'ton shirt, but he also did things in that game that aren't a normal feature of his play (flicked the ball over a City players head, dribbled round a man and generally drove the ball forward).

He's a destroyer; mobile, good at reading the game and a good tackler; but United have never really had midfielders that are as limited as that until the last decade. For me you need to play him as the sole person sitting in front of the defence, with either two creative midfielders in front of him (Mata, Herrera, Pereira), or you need to play him in a midfield two with a creative box-to-box player like Herrera.

Although if you were going to do this you'd probably just play Carrick or Schweinsteiger as the sole holding midfielder and just use Schneiderlin as a rotation option.

1522~~~
I like him, think some of the criticism is overblown and some of it ignores the fact he's still settling, but I've been a bit disappointed with how often players seem to run through him, or generally just get break through our midfield without that much resistance. As Carrick fades and Schweinsteiger can't do it physically any more, that's something we need him to improve on.

1523~~~
Don't get me wrong he's a good player, but I just think he needs creativity around him to get the best out of his abilities. Not to mention that at So'ton he also probably had a bit more room and their counter attacking system meant he not only had more options available, but also that the options were easier to find. As we often see with our system the likes of Carrick and Schweinsteiger are tasked with needing to find pin-point passes in order to break down the opposition, which isn't a feature of Schneiderlin's game.

The problem occurs when Schneiderlin combines with a player who does this, it renders his role very, very limited (It's basically 50% of what Roy Keane did) . He doesn't take the responsibility of (or isn't takes with) bringing the ball out of the deep positions and he doesn't take the responsibility of (or isn't takes with) playing incisive passes to create opportunities. He tends to pass the ball square and allow others to do this, which would be fine if he had attacking players around him who could take that burden.

As I said before he is a very useful player to have. I'd play Schweinsteiger and Herrera against teams we expect to beat, but whose pressing game would cause Carrick problems; I'd play Carrick and Herrera against teams that will sit back and aim for the 0-0; and I'd play Schneiderlin and either Carrick or Schweinsteiger against teams that will come out and try to beat us.

That'd be 4 players for 2 positions which is exactly what we should have; with 2 of them the wrong side of 30 requiring game management.

1524~~~
<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/><img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1525~~~
What's your expectation from schneiderlin?

1526~~~
Essentially this. He plays the double pivot as though he's a limited player playing a single pivot role.

Posters who go on about how he has had a good game fail to realise that he is probably only doing 50% of what we need him to do. He offers nothing in the way of progressing our play. Watch him when we have the ball, there's no effort to move into a position where he is available for a pass. No incisive passing when he has the ball, he just collects the ball from Smalling and plays the ten yard pass that Smalling could just as easily have played himself.

In this system, its not enough to just be good defensively. Schweinsteiger and Carrick must hate playing next to him.

1527~~~
A lot more than I've seen so far. For a start, I was expecting a much more all rounded midfielder than what we've seen so far given the hype. Instead, he looks painfully limited and seems to lack the awareness of what's around him when he has the ball. Two, even defensively he gets caught out of position way too many times for my liking. In fact, I just had a look at whoscored and completely unsurprisingly he's 2nd in the most fouls/game table in the league. When he has to constantly rely on fouling people to compensate for being beaten or being out of position then it's not a good sign. Right now, he's our very own Lucas (Who is rather unsurprisingly top of the fouls/game table). Both painfully limited, don't offer much besides a few crunching tackles and loads of fouls and horribly overrated by both sets of fans.

1528~~~
This is where we slightly differ, I don't think they'll dislike playing with him, just that it makes for a very un-creative and "safe" team. He offers the movement and agility that Carrick is lacking and the tackling and anticipation that Schweinsteiger is lacking. However these benefits are as you allude to, not enough to fill an entire position in the team.

I think the perfect game for him this season was the one of the few games he missed: against Arsenal. Carrick always struggles against fast paced teams that press us and their quick players just ghosted past him like he wasn't even there. Schneiderlin's mobility would have shut out a lot of these attacks and allowed Schweinsteiger to press high up the pitch which was Van Gaal's plan (not saying we'd have won but I don't think we'd have been 3-0 down after 30 mins). 

The problem of course is there's a huge difference between Arsenal away and Watford or Crystal Palace. Against the latter we need creativity rather than a clean sheet at all costs; against the former we'd be happy with a clean sheet and 2-3 chances created.

1529~~~
I do agree he hasn't been very good with his contribution to our attacking play. Plays the simple easy pass most of the time with no real drive to go forward or try penetrative passes. I don't thi k he's ever been genuinely top drawer at it but definitely better than what he has shown so far. I think a lot of it is due to the instructions though and the fact that it's his first season with these players. We are a tough team to play for when it comes to CMs tbf. I do think it will get better. 

As far as his fouling is concerned, it will remain this way I feel. He's far too combative for his fouls not to be high. I don't mind that at all either as long as it doesn't spiral into a problem. 

Comparisons to Lucas are very harsh but never mind, exaggerating to drive home a point I guess.

1530~~~
<a class="username" data-user="52832, @finneh" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/52832/">@finneh</a> 

Yeah granted, they would be grateful for his legs. But in terms of having someone next to them who wants the pass and can do something with it...

1531~~~
It only seems harsh because people have an exaggerated view of how good Schneiderlin really is. I mean Schneiderlin might be slightly better but they're near enough to not make much of a difference.

I'd take a Coquelin level player. He's another one who went through a period of fouling everything in sight but has been very good this season. Also someone who's very positive and decisive in his passing, something Schneiderlin sorely lacks. He doesn't have to be a Scholes with his passing but he fecks around too much. There were people on the forum who were offended at anyone comparing Coquelin and Schneiderlin.

1532~~~
Yea agreed. I think they'll see him as a luxury, but unfortunately it isn't a luxury we can afford against teams that sit back and are looking for the 0-0.

1533~~~
Regardless of how people might overrate Schneiderlin because he plays for us, Lucas is just a high horse bumping into players on the pitch. Does nothing but foul all game long. Coq has had a full year at Arsenal, lets see how Schneiderlin shapes up.

1534~~~
The Fellaini excuse is just that.  I have seen the likes of Osman and Gibson put in good performance partnering Fellaini regularly at times yet Schneiderlin is afforded the excuse that anyone would look bad next to him?

1535~~~
Anyone would look bad next to a player who's as shite as Fellaini currently is, I think is what they're getting at. How well Osman and Gibson played next to him three years ago is completely irrelevant to that point.

1536~~~
a true DM cuts out passes, by positioning himself accordingly and putting tackles only when needed. From what I've seen, Morgan has done exactly that. He is not an al rounded player like you said, but I doubt even we thought he was. LvG plays Bastian or Carrick next to him mainly because his passing isnt exactly top level. Though it is improving. 

His attacking intent contrary to what people think here was never that good anyway. Last season he had 4 goals and an assist, 3 of which were from set pieces. which isnt great numbers for someone who had better attacking threat than here. He always played a defensive midfield role there too whenever I saw. 

Coquelin too makes fouls just as much as Schneiderlin does if not more. There was even a game this season where he had 3 bookable offences for which he was given one yellow card and he was substituted by 60th minute or so. As for Lucas, he isnt half the player Schneiderlin is.

1537~~~
He doesn't always do that because his positioning doesn't seem to be the best and as a result gets caught and lets players drift by him.

I don't care about his goals or assists but his passing is not good enough for a United midfielder nor is his awareness when he has the ball.

Quite obviously not true and something that is quite evident by watching games as well as being borne out by stats. Even Last season when I thought Coquelin looked a bit dodgy he had less fouls/game than Schneiderlin did and while Coquelin seems to have upped his game to another level entirely this season, Schneiderlin has either gone backwards or these kind of performances are about par for him. Now I didn't watch much of Southampton so I sincerely hope it's the former and not a case of him being another overhyped signing.

1538~~~
Since the arsenal game, we were rarely overrun. And very rarely players drift past him. If you see most DMs, thats what happens as they cant cover the length of the pitch so they will have to recover from deep. His passing isnt as good as Bastian or Carrick or Ander but he has a good potential by the accuracy we saw against PSV. He has a pass completion of 90% anyway which is good enough for any team.

Whoscored has rating for schneiderlin at 7.11 overall. Last year he had a rating of 7.5 overall. Its not too much to say that in a new team which is of a higher level, it will take a little time to get to his best but he is playing brilliantly anyways. schneiderlin has got only 2 yellows too. He seems to know how to not get booked which is a great trait for a destroyer to have.

1539~~~
Players do run past Schneiderlin from midfield. Ridiculous to pretend it doesn't happen and worse you see him get caught ahead of the ball which is inexcusable for a DM. There's a reason he has so many fouls.

His passing isn't very good. Full stop.

It's a common caf tactic. When players are shit, let's blame everyone but him. Some nutter was blaming the attack for Schneiderlin being shit!

1540~~~
As I said in my previous post his passing is obviously inferior to the likes of Bastian but he has a pass completion of 90% almost. Which is good enough for someone who apparently isnt very good at passing. i doubt you will find many DMs who are scholeseque in passing. 

You will see any DM being overrun once or twice a game. But on an overall basis, he has been a rock in our midfield. Most of the time players run past Schneiderlin, he closes out the space and presses the player and the opposition end up passing it back. Has happened more times than I can think of. Which is a very smart way of defending and recovering from the player being ahead of you. and again, he has the ability to not get booked from fouls. Coquelin has more yellow cards(3) than he does (2) just so you know even though you think schneiderlin is rash in comparison to the defensively astute coquelin. If anything coquelin should have got sent off in the crystal palace or newcastle game where he got away with murder that day.

1541~~~
You do love a good strawman. I quite specifically said I don't expect him to be another Scholes with his passing or even a Carrick for that matter. Passing accuracy doesn't tell the whole story, obviously. I expect a lot more from a United midfielder. The minimum I would expect from him is the kind of performances Fletcher was putting up before he got his illness. Not just the tackling but the drive and passing ability to be able to push the team forward. Maybe that will come in time but there's no evidence of it right now.

If we're talking about if's and but's then Schneiderlin is quite lucky not to have picked up more yellows as well especially given most of his fouls are very blatant. I like how you've now dropped down to discussing how Coquelin has 1 more yellow and what could/should have happened when you were caught talking complete nonsense suggesting how Coquelin makes more fouls than Schneiderlin.

And by the way, I don't think and have never said Schneiderlin is rash. That's you making up things again. A lot of his fouls are due to him being in the completely wrong position to start off with.

1542~~~
He is a completely different player to fletcher and he has never been that sort of player. He is a Defensive Midfielder who is a destroyer and a presser and who intercepts the ball well and a good tackler of the bll. We needed someone physical and agile like him for ages. Which is why we bought him. We already have someone like the old Fletcher in Herrera. Critiscizing morgan for not playing like another player who is not similar to him in any way is not fair tbh. Bastian kind of plays like how you describe except that he obviously cant match Fletcher's agility at 24 at an age of 30. In the modern game, a player like Morgan is a must for any top team. Saying he is not a united midfielder because of that, is like the argument that a lot here make that Blind is not a good player at CB for us because he doesnt have the physique of Rio. 

Of all the games I have watched him play, he has hardly been making blatant fouls. Most of his fouls are small niggling fouls and if he gets booked for a lot of them it would be very harsh. The funny thing is that he got booked against wolfsburg (i think) for winning the ball. And he has hardly been in wrong positions. Even if he ended up in a wrong position a couple of times, he squeezes the space and makes them pass it back. which may make it seem as if he didnt do anything visibly but is very effective nevertheless.

1543~~~
His average pass length is a bit shorter than that of Carrick, slightly longer than that of Schweinsteiger. He passes backwards less than Bastian (per 90), though he also makes less passes overall. He isn't as creative as the other two, but that is kind of the point. His presence is supposed to allow the other two more attacking freedom. Generally though, his passing is perfectly fine, and perfectly in line with what you generally expect from a midfield destroyer. Going by stats alone, his passing matches that of Busquets (which both highlights the problem of relying on stats alone, and how silly it is to pretend that Schneiderlin is somehow not a good enough passer for a team like United). Busquets does eclipse him in terms of attacking contribution (key passes, mainly), but I think that might have something to do with the teams themselves (though I'm very much aware of Morgan's tendency to opt for the safer alternative). Morgan has more passes per 90, less backward passes, more forward passes and longer average pass length (he also outperforms Coquelin and Matic in those same metrics, but they, as Busquets, contribute more in attack) . Again, these are only stats, but stats that I find interesting given that one of the criticism that keeps getting repeated is that his passing isn't good enough.

Now, given that we know that LvG told Herrera to take less risks, is it out of the question that he might be the reason for Schneiderlin's more conservative approach (in terms of passing)? That Morgan's being instructed to defer to his more creative partner? He's never been a Carrick in terms of passing range or ability, but he's always been solid, and certainly has the ability to contribute more to our attack than he's currently doing.

1544~~~
I wouldn't expect United to play an out and out destroyer which is what he appears to be. So, no, I would disagree with the idea that he's the kind of player we have needed. And no top team has a player as limited as him so the idea that his kind of player is a must is nonsense. And Fletcher is nothing like Herrera. He was a box to box player who was very competent defensively and could push us forward either with his passing or simply his energy and drive.

No point in discussing this any further though if you think his fouls aren't blatant. When you essentially have to come down to arguing that "He's great, you just can't see it" it's time to stop debating.

And I disagree with your initial lines. Carrick is not an attacking player, never has been. His natural inclination has always been sit and dictate game with the occasional forays forward. Schweinstiger is similar but a tad more forward thinking. Why would you partner either of them with a player who also likes to sit but offer precisely nothing going the other way? And I'm not a fan of pure destroyers. We don't need players like that and the club should be aiming for better through the middle.

Forget about his passing length or accuracy. Can you quite honestly say his passing his anywhere near incisive or decisive as it needs to be? Carrick has a great passing range but the best thing about his passing is often how he can pass it in between the lines. Matic has been crap this season but on the ball he's quite clearly a step ahead of Schneiderlin.

As for the bit in bold, if we're going to blame the manager for everything might as well shut down every thread in the Player Performance Forum.

1545~~~
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to suggest that Carrick is an attacking player, simply that he's more creative and is (at least) perceived as being able to contribute more to our attack, same with Schweinsteiger. Schneiderlin has never been on to dictate games, being more of a grafter. That being said, he's far more careful and conservative for us than what he was for Southampton, where he appeared much more mobile and showed a lot more drive and determination going forward (he was arguably better than Matic last season. Arguably.) Safe to say, part of it is probably down to his role, having been deployed as a box-to-box player last season as opposed to the more defensive role he seems to have been given for us, and part of it is... I don't know, settling in, instructions or whatever, maybe van Gaal values his defensive contribution too much to allow him to play like he did for Southampton. I don't know. What I do know, is that his form for Southampton improved season by season, and I have no doubts that what we saw last season is his true level.

However, you have already admitted to not having seen much of him last season (as I interpreted it, correct me if I'm wrong) and you seem convinced that he's not good enough, so I see no reason trying to convince you otherwise.

As for the last bit, overreact much? I wasn't actually blaming van Gaal for everything, simply suggesting an alternative explanation. It's not out of the realm of possibilities that van Gaal, a man known to have asked players to be more conservative, could have asked one of his players to be more conservative, nor is doing so "blaming the manager for everything (or at all, even)".

1546~~~
You don't seem to know what a defensive midfielder does or rather is supposed to do.

Plus you seem to think he is a very limited player. Matic plays no more a role than him in attacks. His passing stats are worse than morgan to be honest meaning even if he tries to pass it forward he isnt very successful at it. He doesnt have morgan's pace too meaning he is very slow and cant recover like morgan can. So your idea that he is some kind of a imited midfielder is laughable and makes me realize that you may not actually have seen him play or rather not paid close attention to how he plays. I'm glad that we have him in the team and not with a rival.

Btw what you describeed about Fletcher is easily how you would describe Herrera too. Its just that now he plays more as a 10.

1547~~~
You are correct however all I've said is that on the basis of what I've seen at United so far he has a lot of things he has to improve upon. I find the idea that he's been in a great form a bit bizarre. I'm not ruling out the possibility that he may improve and reach the levels one expects from a United midfielder. 

Sorry but half the forum is full of people blaming LVG for every players bad form which is a bit annoying. Van Gaal may be a moron but we can only judge based on what we've seen so and I see little point in speculating what the manager may or may not have said to the players.

1548~~~
And now you resort to accusing me of not watching him play.....you're arguments get worse by the post and more focused on personal jabs than the actual point.

And Matic is better on the ball than Schneiderlin (At least he was last season until he turned to shite this season). Not only better on it but he also has the ability to carry the ball forward which is quite invaluable from midfield and something I've not seen Schneiderlin do at all. The fact you are stuck on the same point about how he's a destroyer is pretty much backing my point that he's limited player. He certainly hasn't got much else in his game this season.

<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

Even last season when Herrera played CM he was nothing like Fletcher aside from the fact they both loved a good tackle.

1549~~~
He hit 90% pass accuracy because 21 of his passes were to Smalling, who was usually stood five yards behind him. 10 passes were to Darmian and another 9 to Blind. 40 of his 92 passes were effectively backwards passes. That pass completion stat is misleading and gives the impression that he was doing something effective.

Edit: He made less then 8 passes to either Rooney, Lingard or Memphis

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszone/5-2015/matches/832630/summary#tabs-wrapper-anchor#:RcH0mg2WJ4aysQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.fourfourtwo.com/statszon...0/summary#tabs-wrapper-anchor#:RcH0mg2WJ4aysQ</a>

On top of that, from watching the game, most were 'safe', purposeless passes. In other words, he was just moving the ball on when really he needs to be making more of those short-medium passes to get the opposition chasing our players. It's details like this has our players worn out before the opposition.

No one expects him to be threading balls through to Martial but what I would like from him is to be passing the ball forwards to the front four and Schweisteiger then making sure he is in space and available to receive the ball when they need to move it on. The making himself available for a pass is what he doesn't do nearly enough of.

He's playing in a system where he is not "purely the DM" so he has to offer much more to help progress our play.

1550~~~
I can see how someone might not be to impressed, depending on what they were expecting. I know from last year that he's certainly knows how to be more adventurous, but I expected, based on us buying Schweinsteiger, and already having Carrick and Herrera, that he'd be deployed as a defensive mid. Personally, I've been satisfied with him so far. He hasn't been faultless, but as a pure DM I think he's done well (but again, I can understand that people are expecting more from him). I guess the fact that I know how good he can be might lead to me having an easier time putting some of his faults down to adapting, though. And hopefully, he'll be given a role similar to the one he had last year for Southampton.

Oh, I know. The reason for my speculation is that Schneiderlin certainly has the ability to do the things people expect him to do. That lead me to wonder whether part of the reason for his carefulness was down to his instructions. LvG is a known pragmatic, and values a strong defense, so it's certainly possible.

1551~~~
LVG has again picked a very strange game to drop him, much like the Arsenal one. With the pace at which Leicester attack, he was a must for this game imo. Carrick-BFS in this game is a bad call imo so i'm hoping van Gaal proves me wrong here.

1552~~~
The exact kind of matches he should have been bought for, we drop him.

Mental beyond belief.

1553~~~
Morgan was dropped for the Arsenal game because he was shite the game before against Wolfsburg. He's been dropped again because he was shite against PSV.

Both decisions were understandable and I don't expect us to suffer today like we did against Arsenal.

1554~~~
So why is Rooney playing every game?

1555~~~
The whole team should be dropped then.

Or is it one rule for one, and another rule for others?

1556~~~
We don't apply those rules to everyone in the squad, neither do most teams with good reason . It's simply a case of looking at the bigger picture which is the obvious way to go. We haven't done so here.

1557~~~
If you're operating in a vacuum.

1558~~~
Rooney seems to be a special case which I cant get my head around.

As far as Schneiderlin goes, he's not doing enough when we have possession despite what popular opinion is in here, so I understand why he'd like Carrick in there instead.

Our problems are going forward, not in defense.

1559~~~
Yeah, he hasn't been as good with the ball as we'd like him to be. Doesn't mean we ignore the basics though. We need mobility and cover for our defense. Especially given how rapid Leicester are with their attacks, 2 slow CMs isn't very clever. We are unlikely to outscore Leicester if this game turns into a high scoring one, hard as it may be to digest.

1560~~~
The 90% stats was for the PL overall. Even then he is a DM. He is available for passes from the back 4 and schweini all the time. he also passes to the wingers in the flanks. a diagonal. I dont expect a DM to do more than this

1561~~~
I hope he just came off as a precaution, we are in trouble if he's out over the Christmas period.

1562~~~
Didn't seem to be limping, and didn't seem to get immediate treatment. Hopefully it was just a tight hamstring rather than a pull/tear!

1563~~~
He was limping slightly

1564~~~
We're in deep shit if he's out long-term. Hope he is OK.

1565~~~
Hell, our bench would start looking like our U-21 team if we start losing more midfielders.

1566~~~
That's not too far from the truth <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1567~~~
Did LVG mention anything post-game about his injury? I thought he was looking good until he was subbed off too.

1568~~~
Said he had a minor hip injury but could be a doubt for the Wolfsburg game.

1569~~~
Thanks! Unfortunate then <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

<span style="font-size: 22px"><b>SCHNEIDERLIN SIZES UP WOLFSBURG MISSION</b></span>
<b>Morgan Schneiderlin says Manchester United will approach the final Group B game against Wolfsburg as though it was the Champions League final itself.</b>

To reach the knockout stages, the Reds must pick up three points in Germany or else rely on CSKA Moscow to prevent PSV Eindhoven from winning the other game on Tuesday night.

Louis van Gaal's men were frustrated by PSV in a goalless draw last time out in the competition and now face a tough task against a German club that had a formidable home record before losing to Shinji Kagawa's late winner for Borussia Dortmund on Saturday.

When asked if winning at the Volkswagen Arena would be a tall order, Schneiderlin, who <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2015/Dec/morgan-schneiderlin-and-paddy-mcnair-pick-up-injuries-ahead-of-manchester-united-wolfsburg-game.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">could be a doubt for the trip</a>, told <b><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.manutd.com/programme" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><i>United Review</i></a></b>: "It is but we’re confident we can do it. We beat them at home and, to go through to the next round, we don’t want to hope for CSKA Moscow to win or get a result in Eindhoven. 

"We have the destiny in our hands and know what we have to do to get through. It’s very important for the football club and for the players to get to the next stage and we are going out to win in Wolfsburg. They are a very good team and it’s never easy in Germany but we will prepare for this game as though it was the final of the Champions League."

The disappointing stalemate with PSV was clearly an unhappy experience for the France international, who admitted the Reds lost momentum in the second half at Old Trafford.

"Against PSV there were two different halves," said Schneiderlin. "I think we did well in the first half and created some chances, which is what we wanted. We couldn’t find the back of the net but we did okay with keeping possession so there was some running but it was enjoyable running. 

"We were moving with the ball and running into space. In the second half, for whatever reasons, I lost and we lost the ball too many times and that made us run after it a lot. So it was the kind of running you don’t enjoy very much. We couldn’t get the ball back as quickly as we wanted. These kind of halves can happen sometimes but we were still good enough to keep the clean sheet."

Schneiderlin appreciates the need for United to be rubbing shoulders with the continent's elite again after missing out on the competition altogether last season. 

"The Champions League group stages are important but the real aspect of the competition is the knockout stage," he added. "You know the best 16 teams in Europe are involved and we are looking forward to trying to put Manchester United in this category. 

"Last year, we did not have the Champions League here so we are determined to get among the best teams in Europe. After that, anything is possible. We know over two games in the knockout stages, anything can happen and we really want to get there, step up and give our best."

1571~~~
We're crippled defensively without Schneiderlin in our team. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

1572~~~
I watch every game (lately, to my regret) and never really notice Morgan when he plays.

I'm not sure what he is supposed to be good at/what he contributes. Can someone offer an explanation?

I'm not trying to bash him or criticise him in anyway. I just genuinely couldn't tell someone what his traits/talents/contributions are.

1573~~~
He is a physical presence in there, he gets his body in there and likes a tackle. Considering our other midfielders, Carrick, Bastian and Fellaini, he also has the legs. He is no Carrick or Bastian on the ball but I feel he is fine on the ball, he has had some below par games but on average I feel he keeps possession well enough.

1574~~~
One of the highest successful tackles per game for a midfielder (twice that of any of our midfielders), also up there in terms of interceptions. Passing of 89% completion, all last season.

Why isn't he in the team more regularly? He has the legs and screens our defence well. We are getting blitzed by teams like Norwich and Bournmouth. Why do we persist with Carrick who basically has to do it on his own, and to be fair he doesn't have the spring in his step to do the job required.

Composed on the ball too. To watch us get countered so easily when we have someone sitting on the sidelines who can aid us in those areas is disappointing.

1575~~~
Was he fully fit? If he was and still didn't play, van Gaal is even more clueless than I thought he was.

1576~~~
He should have taken Fellaini off for Morgan and Wayne off for Ander. They are desperate for Wayne to get his goals and it is stopping the manager making the right changes.

1577~~~
And if he wasn't he is even more clueless for having player he can't use on the bench.

1578~~~
Which begs the question why wasn't Nick Powell on the bench?

1579~~~
I am surprised as you are. Thought we could sub him for Martial today.

1580~~~
Schneiderlin and Carrick is our best pairing. Fellaini is all over the pitch. I've been a silent defender of Fellaini for a while now, but he literally has no position he excels at, and he is clearly not good enough to have a free roaming role like Ronaldo. Stick Schneiderlin next to Carrick/Schweinsteiger, and put Herrera ahead of them. Then much will be sorted with dynamic legs and the brilliant passing of Carrick. Push Mata out wide until he regains some form, then maybe put him back in the center.

1581~~~
Can only hope he's filling in the bench as Young was rather than being out of favour.

Lose all sense of security without him. Go back to our biggest defeats in Wolfsburg, Arsenal, Bournemouth and Norwich. Games he was missing.

1582~~~
He is a starter for us, can see Jose having a lot of joy with him, until he fecks up and then throws him under the bus, like Matic <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1583~~~
We've not lost a league game when he's played. Very telling. Many were saying it was coincidental not long ago, but we're very vulnerable without him and it has always showed. We ship a lot of goals without him. It's surprising so many have been underwhelmed by him. I'm not sure what people are expecting of a defensive midfielder, but he's rarely put a foot wrong, and our defence has looked a bombscare in the games that he didn't play.

1584~~~
People are obviosuly expecting the second coming of Redondo. Seriosuly, he was very good lately and good in the beginning. His defensive contribution is masisvely underrated, and he really made some effort in his passing. He is naturally restricted in the system, not his fault. And he still can improve, a starter for me in front of our CB's.

1585~~~
A great player whom we have really missed. If he's healthy, he should be an automatic starter alongside one of of Carrick of BFS (after his suspension of course.)

1586~~~
Still think we should be playing 4-3-3 with Herrera/Schneiderlin/ and 1 of BFS or Carrick. 

1 thing is for sure though, we do desperately need him back. No way would Norwich have scored 2 goals against us countering with him in the team.

1587~~~
Is he not rated?

1588~~~
I think he isnt 'van Gaal matchfit' enough.

1589~~~
He'll probably start against Chelsea, which is the bigger game.

1590~~~
Rather target 3 points against Stoke and play our strongest team.

1591~~~
Morgan is no world beater so its never a shock to me when he doesn't start, same goes for Herrera. I am a fan of both players but the reaction from some fans can be OTT when it comes to team selections.

1592~~~
Morgan is a world beater compared to our other options though, hence the reactions.

1593~~~
It's surprising he has been out for so long. I thought he would have been back in today for sure.

1594~~~
Don't think he's appeared at all since his return from injury despite being on the bench for a couple so i assume LVG doesn't think he has the 'match rhythm' to play 2 games in 3 days. Think he'll be missed today.

1595~~~

1596~~~
Fair enough if he gets 20/30 mins and starts against Chelsea.

1597~~~
Really should have started today. Chelsea is the bigger game, but this is probably the tougher game, both physically and overall. We ship a ridiculous amount of goals when he doesn't play. It's no coincidence. And we've done it again in the first 45.

1598~~~
Woeful decision to not start him today. He's built for games like this.

1599~~~
Was he unfit?

1600~~~
Given the circumstances, there was no game bigger than this.

1601~~~
Didn't even come on. Just really really strange. Is he 100% fut?

1602~~~
I cannot for the life of me understand why LVG llayed two DMs in all those home games and then decided to suddenly play only one CM ever since the cries if 'attack, attack, attack'. Did he think abandoning midfield is what the crowd meant with those chants?

1603~~~
Wassup with him ?

1604~~~
Going to assume he fecked Mrs. Van Gaal.

1605~~~
We desperately need a player like him in the team, a player who will cover the whole pitch win the balls and will make us solid, look at Herrera today he was doing it all if he had a partners of manchester United quality he could more focus on creating more and passing which was off today but he won so many balls, done defensive job which if made by a player like Schneiderlin would definitely help him and other players to start attacks higher and overall have an easier job.

1606~~~
Yes.. it has been amateur hour from LVG with some of the midfield selections in this bad patch.

1607~~~
Has Herrera and schneiderlin ever played in the same midfield together, as a 2 or 3?

1608~~~
don't think so

1609~~~
<span style="text-decoration: line-through">PSV Away I think.</span>

EDIT: Nope, was Schweinsteiger Herrera nevermind.

EDIT 2: CSKA Moscow Away we had Herrera, Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin.

1610~~~
Crazy that really. Arguably our 2 most dynamic / most rounded CMs haven't played together. Would love to see them 2 with a base of schweinsteiger pulling the strings.

1611~~~
Herrera played as a 10 didn't he?

1612~~~
Yeah, was a midfield 2.

1613~~~
I think Van Gaal is realising we need goals and is opting for Fellaini. 

It's funny as for ages people were saying we don't need 2 holding midfielder so LVG goes with Carrick and Fellaini and we lose the great defensive cover we were getting but nothings changed on the other end of the pitch. 

I can see the logic in what he's trying but it hasn't worked. Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger/Carrick and Herrera has to be given a run of 5 games as a midfield 3 to see how well it can pay off.

1614~~~
Yeah, definitely. Really failed to find the right balance in midfield all season and we haven't even tried the most obvious 3.

1615~~~
It's actually insane our two most dynamic and combative midfielders have only started together once.

1616~~~
Some say Plato forbade it.

1617~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1618~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

The mental and the physical are two different things, after all. Who needs mobility and grit if they lack the process.

1619~~~
He chose the wrong midfielder to drop, that's the problem. Schneiderlin needs to always play. As does Herrera in midfield. Van Gaal went with fellaini so we can go with long balls to beat the press on occasion, like we did last year. Don't think he'd be put in for goals when he hasn't been scoring much this year

1620~~~
I agree he chose the wrong midfielder. Fellaini should never ever be in a deeper position for a club like United.

1621~~~
feck off I wanna understand this

1622~~~
Just teasing on the fact of the 'philosophy' - Plato is one of the most famous philosophers of all time.

1623~~~
Like most people on here I was so excited about signing this guy but he seems to have been a shadow of his Southampton self for us <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Is it just a case of what Fergie always used to say about certain players not being "United players" mentally?

1624~~~
I think he's been decent when played. 

Mostly solid and reliable performances which is what you want. Occasional top class performances and a few disappointing ones. 

I can't understand why he hasn't been starting of late. Should be back in the team for Chelsea without a doubt.

1625~~~
Is everyone ignoring the fact that he may still not be 100% fit yet? Only logical reason really. He's not played since West Ham (iirc) but has had to be on the bench since, well...else we won't have 7 players to fill it.

But we've missed him, just like we seem to miss everyone once they're injured. I'd love to see Valencia and Rojo at fullback now.

1626~~~
Schneiderlin played 70 minutes against Swansea, but didn't play at all in the other 4 defeats in the Premier League. He didn't play against PSV (bench) or Wolfsburg (injured against them) either. So basically he has played 70 minutes in our 7 defeats this season. Another master stroke from Van Gaal...

1627~~~
He loves Fellaini. Long balls and all that.

1628~~~
One player (of many) who'd benefit from a change of Manager.

Van Gaal's use of him has been terrible, in terms of the games he's played in not positionally.

1629~~~
Been our best player.

1630~~~
Yup, he just dominates the midfield, doesn't give anyone a moment to think.

1631~~~
Am I missing something or wasn't the reason he didn't play much over the last few weeks was because he was injured? <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/>

1632~~~
We look so much better with him in the team

1633~~~
Schneiderlin has to start every game for us. He brings so much more bite and stability to the midfield it's insane.

1634~~~
Hopefully people can stop saying he's been underwhelming now. He has a specific job on the pitch, and he does it very well. He gives the two centre backs great support, something which we've not had for weeks. It's no coincidence that we keep clean sheet the moment he starts again.

1635~~~
Great player.

1636~~~
Him, De Gea and Smalling should be automatic starters when fit.

1637~~~
I know some have issues with his passing but in our current situation and with our current options what he offers when we aren't in posession is vital, he's the only CM we have that can cover the ground.

1638~~~
Definitely some issues with his passing but he has to play purely because we are <i>so </i>much more solid when he is in the team.

1639~~~
Thread title is such a WUM <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1640~~~
He's great and should start every game when fit.

1641~~~
He can be a right cnut, flying into tackles. 

I like that, though. Better than moping up and down the pitch with no purpose

1642~~~
Schneiderlin should be starting every game. He's in his peak and no need to rest him. Players like that need to be playing regularly to get and keep their intensity. We should be rotating BFS and Carrick alongside him.

1643~~~
Schmidfield <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

1644~~~
No idea why he get's benched every other game, not like he's 34 and needs a rest every other week, should be starting every game.

1645~~~
He hasn't won over LVG yet. It's the same with Herrera, and it was the same with Mata and Smalling.

1646~~~
I really wish we'd at least try partnering him and Herrera in the middle with Mata as the number 10.

1647~~~
We haven't lost a game with him in the team this season. However, LVG will take no notice.

1648~~~
Should be a starter in every game imo and I think he could hold down the middle on his own.

1649~~~
Really!? Impressive if true.

1650~~~
We hardly ever scored with him in the team either. It's not really that impressive when you look through the results with him in the team, but it's quite obvious we are better defensively though.

And yeah, we lost against Swansea with him as a starter I think.

1651~~~
It's nuts how teams concede far less when this guy plays. It was the same with Southampton. Their defence looked unbreachable when he was still there and now they are conceding like that's the key to success.

1652~~~

1653~~~
I forgot about Swansea. That criticism would be valid if his job was to attack. But he's in the team to make us solid and make sure we control the middle of the park. No one else in our squad comes close to him in fulfilling those duties. Our failure to score when he's in the team or isn't is down to the lads infront of him and the manager.

1654~~~
Thought he was really good yesterday. 

Why he didn't play at Stoke baffles me but hey it's Van Gaal, logic goes out of the window.

1655~~~
<a class="externalLink" href="https://twitter.com/ManUtd/status/681582742845394944" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Morgan Schneiderlin: "It was a must for us to be on the front foot. Our fans deserve to see attractive football."

</a>

1656~~~
It's all thanks to the new baresi

1657~~~
Thought he was pretty poor against Chelsea if I'm honest, he slows down our play far too often and is far too negative on the ball. Sure he offers more defensive cover but that's not enough at a club like Utd, to often he turns backwards instead of driving the ball through midfield or playing that killer ball into the strikers. He's got a hell of a long way to go to become Utd quality.

1658~~~
I think that is a bit of fear. I thought he has played decently all season and then he finds himself benched. Clearly Van Gaal responds well to possession which is why so many of our players refuse to take risks with the ball. Even low percentage risk. That won't change unless LvG changes his stripes or is replaced. Schneiderlin is required for our team to function properly. Now stick on an actual forward and a right winger and I think we see different results.

1659~~~
He and Herrera are massive parts in helping out with that and it'd be ace to seem them together in every game their fit with Schweinsteiger when he can play.

1660~~~
Goals conceded per 90 mins when he is on the pitch: 0.52 

Goals conceded per 90 mins when he's NOT on the pitch: 1.39

1661~~~
couldn't agree more

1662~~~
Really? I thought he was class against Chelsea, especially in the first half. Such a great defender.

1663~~~
We would get cut open in seconds. Herrera is not a 2 man midfielder

1664~~~
Most wouldn't say scholes was if he didn't play for United in one

1665~~~
Best signing and shame that we haven't found the right formation to make the best of this quality footballer. We have have some quality players, and yet some first team players that are nothing better than squad players

1666~~~
Scholes had a different skill set to Herrera though. He could dictate the play and tempo from deeper positions and was probably the best passer in the Premier League. Herrera on the other hand is basically a #10 or at the very least an advanced midfielder in a 4-3-3. Herrera in a 2 man combined with having Mata at #10 who is weak with the ball and doesn't have the energy or work rate (of a Rooney for example) would be a disaster defensively

1667~~~
Probably the same genius reason he didn't play at Arsenal!

1668~~~
Not really. Herrera does quite a bit of defensive work, has a great work rate, and is a very good tackler. Next to Schneiderlin he'd be excellent in a 2 man midfield IMO, or Carrick. Both have the great defensive awareness to cover for Herrera if he's out of position, but Herrera has the energy to make up for not having the best positional sense. In a two man midfield, you need one of your midfielders to be adventurous and more offensively minded, like Herrera is. They can't both be defensive mids. Schneiderlin and herrera could both basically be box to box players, just one is more defensive, while Herrera is more attacking (as it should be in a partnership like that). Van Gaal most likely won't ever try it, but you can be perfectly sure that under Fergie it would be brilliant. After all, look at the players that Fergie made work in a 2 man midfield over the last few years. Cleverley, Anderson, Giggs, etc... Are you going to tell me they are more suited to a 2 man midfield then Herrera? Nonsense really.

1669~~~
On the ball he can improve a lot, and has shown he has it in him on occasion to be better. But defensively he does so much that he just has to start. When he plays, we hardly ever concede goals, let alone lose games. He just makes it all work from a defensive viewpoint.

1670~~~
Disagree. Obviously I'm not suggesting this for big matches, but in games we're expected to dominate possession Schneiderlin is good enough to protect the back 4 by himself and Herrera is no slouch in midfield either.

1671~~~
Perhaps but Utd have never had a defensive mentality and I don't think we should need to either, maybe that is just a sign of the times. Schniderlin is a player you use when your worried about the opposition but I still beleive that the best of of defence is to attack.

1672~~~
Good work defensively but not one of his better days on the ball, don't think he's helped by playing as a midfield 1 a lot of the time.

1673~~~
He's not good enough on the ball for a United midfielder.

1674~~~
United midfielder with the best pass completion rate over the course of the season and also today. He's doing what he's supposed to do and considering it's his first season at this level, it's good enough. He should definitely improve, but Schweinsteiger's and Carrick's performances have been the bigger problem. He enables them to do what they are supposed to do, control the game and start attacks, but they've both been disappointing for the most part by their standards. If we had Gündogan, Verratti, Thiago, Cazorla or Modric next to him, we'd look a lot better.

1675~~~
You can't have seen him for Southampton last season, then. He was amazing as a box-to-box mid who contributed a lot to their attack. Just because he hasn't really done so for United (yet) doesn't mean he isn't capable of doing so. I'm more inclined to put his relative lack of attacking contribution down to LvG preferring to use him as a shield for the defense rather than him not being United quality.

I'm inclined to say "don't bother". I've pointed to stats showing that he's no worse than our other midfielders (hell, his stats are comparable to similar players in other big teams) in terms of pass completion, length or direction, but others will simply hide behind the ol' "stats don't tell the whole story" ( I know they don't, but they can, sort of, prove that a lot of people are talking complete bollocks). 

I know a lot of fans are (naturally) judging him based on his performances for us, but it actually pains me when it's obvious that they've never actually taken note of how he's played before he joined us (and in some cases, it's obvious that they knew nothing about what kind of player he was), and criticizes him for being unable to do things he had no problems doing before arriving here.

1676~~~
Pass completion means diddly squat. He lacks awareness and the passing to play there. Even today there were a couple of occasions where he got caught out and it's something that's happened throughout the season.

<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> at the bit in bold. If we had those Schniederlin wouldn't make the bench.

1677~~~
He should be judged on how he plays for United, now how he did at his previous club. His current level is not good enough.

1678~~~
One of them obviously. Why is Wenger insisting on playing Coquelin alongside Cazorla? Coquelin has basically the same role Schneiderlin has with us. If he's not good enough, then what about Schweinsteiger, Carrick, Herrera and Fellaini?

1679~~~
Coquelin has been clearly better than Schneiderlin and has improved loads this season. Also a better and more incisive passer.

1680~~~
He's not good enough? FFS people need to stop with his overreactions. He's not Roy Keane but he's not Djembax2 either

1681~~~
We bought him to protect defense, as other people have said we need a dynamic player who can dictate play besides him. He is decent on the ball and can definitely hit a long ball, but a playmaker he will never be.

1682~~~
I think LvG misses a trick by leaving him out for matches where he thinks we're going to dominate possession. Those are the games where we're most vulnerable to counter-attacks. The Norwich game is probably the most depressing example. Schneiderlin needs to play every game, but especially the ones where we're camped in the opponent's half. It's counter-intuitive, but that's when we've dropped the most points and needed the most pace in midfield.

1683~~~
Seriously. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1684~~~
Yeah but over the summer, the clamour for his signing got me all hyped up that we were getting someone like yaya.

But so far I don't see what the fuss is about.  His level seems to be the current United level and we'll need to upgrade on him if we are to compete at the top end of British football.

Or he'll have to do a 'Fletcher' and significantly improve.

1685~~~
I agree - in his role as box to box, he simply goes missing for too long and does not influence the game enough.

Take Carrick from 2007-2011 - he was never more than a 2 passes away from every move.

Morgan needs to properly impose himself into this team - I don't see what he is waiting for.

1686~~~
I would call him more of an defensive box-to-box. He actually had the role of a Deep lying playmaker for Southampton since Wanyama is useless on the ball and he did it quite well, but for us he should just protect our defense while someone like Gundogan roams around and dictates.

1687~~~
So he is just a classic water carrier?

1688~~~
Disagree. Cazorla is the one that makes things happen in Arsenal's midfield. Coquelin has not been that much better either. He's just playing for the better team at this moment in time and his skill set suits the Arsenal team perfectly. Basically he gives them the balance they've been lacking for years. Schneiderlin could do the same for us, if we had better attacking players around him.

Quite obvious you've never properly seen him then and still don't know what type of player he is. He always was more of a Fernandinho than a Y. Toure.

1689~~~
More incisive? What does that mean exactly? Schneiderlin has made significantly more passes than Cocquelin this season, averages more passes per 90 minutes, and has a better pass completion %, more key passes per game, more chances created, more forward passes, has a greater average pass distance. Schneiderlin has also won more tackles, made more interceptions and clearances. (Source: Squawka). What has Coquelin done better than Schneiderlin?

We rarely lose and we concede much fewer when Schneiderlin plays. Southampton had the 2nd best defence in the league last season, and he was an enormous factor in that. Now they have a very poor defence and we have currently the 2nd best defence. When he has played, we have conceded 7 goals in 14 games and lost only once. When he hasn't played, we have conceded 10 goals in only 6 games and lost 4 of those. None of that is a coincidence. He is our best defensive midfielder, and it's not even close.

1690~~~
He's started 12 games in the PL - we've won <b>7</b>, drawn <b>4</b>, and lost <b>1</b>, scoring <b>15</b> and conceding <b>6</b>. <b>8</b> clean sheets. ------> 25/36 points.
He's been a substitute in 2 games - we've won <b>1</b> and drawn <b>1</b>, scoring <b>3</b> and conceding <b>1</b>. <b>1</b> clean sheet. -----> 4/6 points.
He's not started in the remaining 6 games - we've won <b>1</b>, drawn <b>1</b> and lost <b>4</b>, scoring <b>5</b> and conceding <b>10</b>. <b>1</b> clean sheet. -----> 4/18 points.

1691~~~
It's a narrative that people have to stick by when they don't really know much about the roles of either player and what they bring to the team, they just assume Coq is better because he improved last year.

1692~~~
Basically, what we need is Basti of 4 years ago to be just ahead of him.

At the minute, BFS is not as slick or as agile enough to really bring out the best in Schneiderlin. If we add someone like Gundogan next to him, he would really thrive. He is not an all out destroyer, but he is not a flamboyant number 8 either. He is a brilliant CDM though.

1693~~~
I had this exact same debate weeks ago. Not doing it again.

As for the whole goal without him that people keep bringing up it's misleading. One, when we don't play him LVG somehow thinks playing just 1 CM is good enough and leaves Carrick all alone in midfield which leads to predictably dire results. This was also due BFS being suspended and Herrera being injured which was bad luck. Two, we went through a defensive crisis and ended up with McNair, CBJ and Carrick himself in defensive when Schneiderlin was injured.

1694~~~
Fantastic at his job which is protecting his defense. We did not buy him to be the next Xavi.

1695~~~
Absolutely. We don't need a bog standard water carrier which is what he's been so far. Based on sheer volume of praise I was expecting a lot more than we've seen.

1696~~~
This is no coincidence. He brings much needed mobility to our midfield. It's great to see him and Hererra back in the side. No idea what LVG's been playing at over the last few months.

1697~~~
He's not a flashy player but fits the balance of the team. He gives our midfield a mobility that it would otherwise lack.

1698~~~
Both injured for a long stretch, Schneiderlin was rested for the Chelsea game too with a lack of games under his belt.

1699~~~
Obviously his performances for United should be used to judge him as a United player (and going by those, claiming his current level isn't good enough is just straight up retarded). What I am getting at, though, is that declaring him "not good enough for United" based on those alone, without considering his earlier performances for other teams is ignorant as feck. You've clearly never actually seen him play before he arrived, so you don't know anything about his capabilities, and it's fair to say that you are in no position to judge whether or not he's got what it takes to make it here.

In other words, you knew nothing about the player before he arrived, and you're judging him based on what kind of player you thought he was going to be rather than the player he is (and always has been). If I had thought Martial was a poacher, would it be fair of me to call him a bit shit based on his performances for us? Or should I own up to the fact that I didn't know the player, and accept that I was wrong?

Schneiderlins' stats last season (and this season) are comparable to the best defensive mids in Europe, but they're all better than him, he's rubbish and will need to be upgraded on if we're to avoid relegation to Conference North.

1700~~~
No we need an upgrade on his partners in midfield - a top level deep lying playmaker and a world class no.10. He clearly needs to improve on the ball but a Carrick he will never be. It might be far fetched but I'd like to see him paired with Perreira just for a spell because I feel BFS has lost the agility to be the man that drives us forward from midfield.

1701~~~
I don't remember the injury crisis against Arsenal when they walked 3 goals in and LvG decided to play no defensive midfielder, whilst Schneiderlin sat the full 90 on the bench. Until that game, Schneiderlin had played every game where we lost only once in 7 games and were top of the league. Then he came back in to the side after the Arsenal pummelling, scored a goal against Everton, and we kept 4 clean sheets in a row.

Must be some kind of coincidence.

1702~~~
That's a really convenient way of avoiding addressing the fact that your argument was completely dismantled. Do you think Coquelin would be an upgrade to Scheniderlin in our current side?

1703~~~
he's good overall, offering not much going forward and being defensively very good, exactly why he was brought in. He will become much better once we sack that dutch master of tactics and start to play high line with someone like Pochettino. We showed that desire to win the ball in opening minutes and Swansea didn't know what to do, we couldn't maintain that, players like rooney and sweinsteigger has miserable stamina.. 

Schneiderlin is good in the system right now as he's good player but he can be much better in other system.

1704~~~
Interestingly - In the CL, he played 3, we won and drew 2. He didn't feature against PSV and Wolfsburg away, and we lost both. 

He, for me, is our most important player (one of). Great signing and, it's no coincidence, we're far better with him on the pitch than off.

1705~~~
There's a lot more to come from with him. He does loads defensively, and United are overall a lot better with him on the pitch as the results show. On the ball he can and will improve though. He showed he has it in him in some games this season, it's just been inconsistent. He's IMO the best defensive midfielder in the league though when on form, and it's mind boggling that Van Gaal has dropped him randomly now and then.

1706~~~
And who's said that? When you have to resort to shit strawman's you know you have no argument.

I'm not expecting a master passer but Schneiderlin is far too limited for my liking. 

So that one game proves everything eh? It's fairly obvious that our defensive record would be a lot better without Schneiderlin in the team if we didn't coincidentally suffer the injuries at the back or if Van Gaal stopped playing a one man CM. Those numbers are utterly pointless without context and completely ignores that we suffered loads of problems with injuries and suspensions when Schneiderlin wasn't in the team. But carry on ignoring these issues and blindly using those stats.

No, you're free to look through my posts. I have no desire to go through it again.

As to your question, most definitely yes.

1707~~~
This is van Gaal we're talking about. Nothing he does makes much sense.

1708~~~
He makes so many vital interceptions and tackles, and I love how high he presses up the field forcing them backwards. Yes he can make some niggly fouls but that's just his style, you know you're in for a match when he is playing.

Yes his passing could be more consistent and he could offer more of a goal threat, but he is fantastic at his job. If he was played at the base of a 3 man midfield with the job of winning the ball and feeding it forwards he would be 1 of the best in the world at that job IMO.

1709~~~
The last bit about relegation was hyperbole, but everything else have been said about him in this very thread. And it's precious of you to accuse others of having no argument, given that you say the same thing every time (not good enough on the ball), without being able to substantiate it, and then hand-waving away any evidence to the contrary.

1710~~~
Did the Idiot bench him today??

1711~~~
I didn't just use one game. I used all of his games in my previous post, but there was <i>obviously </i>a reason why those stats are skewed. But now I'm just using "that one game". Make your mind up...

How come it's described as a "one man CM" when Carrick was abandoned in midfield by Schweinsteiger or Fellaini, but it's not described as the same when Schneiderlin was abandoned by Schweinsteiger earlier in the season? Probably because it was less visible, because Carrick has little-to-no defensive resilience these days, and Schneiderlin is very robust in that respect and doesn't get walked through. Yet somehow, that is a mark against him, for doing his job well it seems.

He is our best option as the number 6. It's not even up for debate. Statistically, only Fernandinho has better numbers than him as a DM this season in the PL, who is having a very good season himself.

1712~~~
Abit worrying don't you think as Ive watched him in every game he has played for us?!

1713~~~
This is the bit that perplexes me. No too long ago, I pointed out the fact that he's been frequently let down by his midfield partner, but still manages to keep us from unraveling and conceding the middle, but that's somehow being turned against him. It apparently shows that he's to reliant on his midfield partner to make things happen, instead of, you know, proving that he's a quality DM that manages to keep us from unraveling completely despite having a midfield partner who might as well have been sitting in a wheelchair.

1714~~~
He had a few games where he showed some penetrative passing. Need to see more of that.

My biggest issue with him is his awareness when we're in possession. He doesn't show for the ball enough.

1715~~~
should be one of the first names on the team sheet.

1716~~~
Absolutely.

I think some people are expecting far too much of a defensive midfielder in general. I think we could even bring in Busquets, probably the best around in that role, and plenty would still be expecting him to be launching 40 yard piledrivers into the top corner, right after nutmegging every outfield player on the pitch. 

A good defensive midfielder doesn't and shouldn't really stand out, and it's unrealistic to expect Schneiderlin to take centre stage. Those who are saying they expect more from him, what 'more' are you expecting? Winning the ball back, protecting the back four, playing good accurate passes to the more creative players whilst rarely losing possession is his job, and he does that. He does it better than Carrick, Schweinsteiger and Fellaini. He did it last season just as well as he is doing it this season. I'm not sure what else he should be doing, but I predict if he took on a much more expensive role on the pitch, it would detract from the disciplined defensive job he is currently doing, and doing well.

1717~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Way to shit all over <a class="username" data-user="69862, @Akash" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@Akash</a> view guys! True stats aren't everything but there comes a point when they become beyond contestation.

1718~~~
He has to improve on the ball, no doubt. His contribution to the team is huge though. Must play every game IMO.

1719~~~
We just look very competitive with him in the side. Really hope there's a future for him and herrera as partners one day. Think the ability to win the ball high up the pitch could be important for us

1720~~~
A lot of the time he's clearly been told to hold back and not join the attack. When we were pushing (failing) for a goal vs Chelsea, he was with the centre backs.

1721~~~
The only way I can see him playing in the same midfield as Herrera is, as part of a midfield 3.

1722~~~
very good player with a specific role in the team that he does very well.

Feel he will continue to improve with time too, as well as allowing those around him to play better too.

Great signing

1723~~~
That never happened and I never said Schweinstiger abandoned Carrick. The problem was Fellaini or rather LVG playing Fellaini in a way which ensured we were completely open in midfield. If you're saying playing next to Fellaini and Schweinstiger is comparable I'm not sure what to say to that...

Also, people moaning about the Arsenal game...he was only dropped for it because he was diabolical against Wolfsborg and very lucky not to be sent off.

An argument which has been made before but seeing as you're a lazy arse I'll repeat it. Having 90% passing success means nothing. Leon Britton had that for ages and his passing is nowhere near good enough for us. Scheniderlin's passing ability when it comes to feeding it to the forward players is abysmal. Even now when Carrick get's the ball, he's excellent at fizzing it through to our more creative players. Coquelin gets the ball and immediately looks forward to their forward players. Matic has been crap this season but he's another who's excellent at playing between the lines. Someone brought up Schneiderlin's passing stats for one of the games earlier in the thread and a bulk of his passes were to the back 4.

No one expects him to be threading through balls to Martial. But I do expect him to be more pro-active with his passing and show a bit more awareness when he's on the ball and even off the ball. Also just noticed he's now overtaken the fouling machine Lucas as player with the most fouls/game in the league which is completely unsurprising given the number of times he has to resort to fouling people due to being all over the place.

At the very least, I expected a player of Fletcher's quality. Someone who's good defensively but is a good passer and can drive the team forward when required. I haven't seen anything from Morgan so far to suggests he has that in his locker. I hope he does and goes on to improve but in his current guise he's far too limited.

1724~~~
I really like schneiderlin and think he goes under the radar a bit sometimes, the amount of brilliant interceptions and tackles he makes is great.

First half today I thought he looked shaky and got caught on the ball a couple of times also I remember him pinging quite a poor pass out of play. Second half he was better and did what he's best at which is winning the ball and moving it along to someone else. Solid performance with a few dodgy moments first half but he's hardly played so it's to be expected.

1725~~~
Great signing, very happy we have him in the team.

1726~~~
Exactly what we needed in the team. I hope he gets a little more tidy in possession but a very shrewd signing.

1727~~~
Feck off, yeah?

And stats from ONE game? That proves what? That he, that one game, played a lot of back passes?

But hey, since you've now officially opened the floor for the use of stats, let us look at some more advanced stats (American-style). I'll preface this (as usual) by saying that I'm very much aware of the fact that stats don't tell the whole story, but they can still be useful. I decided to compare Morgan to the two players you hold up as examples for him to follow, namely Matic and Coquelin. For practical reasons, the stats are PL only.

First off, let's take a look at last seasons stats (the season I often point to when people who'd never seen him play before arrived here claim that he isn't good enough for us).
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/muZE9Ta.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/muZE9Ta.png"/>

Hmm, it would appear as if Morgan outperformed both of them, at least statistically, in almost every single metric (I opted to exlclude Pass Completion, as you seem to have an aversion to it). But I guess he could still learn a thing or two about passing the ball forward or creating chances from them.

Okay, let's look at this season.
<img alt="[​IMG]" class="bbCodeImage LbImage" data-url="http://i.imgur.com/pD8um6x.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/pD8um6x.png"/>

(Matic is still here because... whatever). Oh, would you look at that? Again we see Morgan outperforming those he should be taking lessons from (except for chances created, where Matic, despite being a bit shit, outperforms the other two).

He hasn't been amazing at contributing to our attack, but as his stats from last season show, he's very much capable of doing so. And the stats from this season show that the "much better" Coquelin hasn't actually been that much better. So the question is, are you now willing to accept that it might come down the role he's being asked to play for us, or are you going to keep harping on about him being "bang average" and "not good enough on the ball" while holding up Matic (who you, strangely, seem more willing to credit for what he did last season than you do Schneiderlin) and Coquelin as shining beacons of DM perfection?

(No, I'm not basing my argument that Schneiderlin is as good as the other two on stats, but they do support the impression I've gotten from watching them).

1728~~~
I really have no idea what those stats are meant to show? Did you actually read my post? Do you have stats for how many of those forward passes were played to non-defenders? Do you have stats for for many of those forward passes were played to our creative players and strikers? Do you have stats for how quickly he can regain possession and set up a counter attack? Taking the United example, Are you seriously telling me there's no difference between Carrick's passing when he plays there compared to Schneiderlin? Or even Fletcher? I'm saying the role he plays should require him to do a lot more than just winning the ball and laying it off. That's the level we should be looking at. He needs to take on more responsibility and start becoming more than just a glorified water carrier. So far, he's done the bare minimum, nothing more. 

And you keep on using strawman arguments. Where have I said Coquelin is the perfect DM? If you can't argue based on what I've posted then don't bother. Matic has been rubbish this season, no arguments but he was excellent last season and unlike Schneiderlin he can also go past people in midfield which is a big plus. I didn't see much of Schneiderlin last season so I'm judging him purely on what I've seen for United.

1729~~~
The stats are meant to show that he's way better on the ball than you're giving him credit for. As it stands, they are (unfortunately) the only decent, objective way to illustrate a players contribution short of sitting down and re-watching every game together. And, as I stated (twice!), I'm not claiming that they represent the absolute truth, only that they can be a helpful tool.

Of course I don't know who the passes were played to, but I'm guesstimating (based on what I've seen) they're about as evenly spread among his teammates as those of Coquelin and Matic. And where did I say that there's no difference between Carrick's and Schneiderlin's passing? Or even mention Carrick, for that matter? For someone so peeved by strawmen, you sure don't seem too averse to using them yourself (if you can't argue based on what I've posted, don't bother, as someone once said). I was (obviously) comparing him to the players you are holding up as examples for him to follow. Anyone who saw them play last season would know that there wasn't much between the three of them, and that Matic and Coquelin don't represent something that he should aspire to, because he's already there.

And he does more than win the ball and lay it off, and he's done a hell of a lot more than the bare minimum. It's one thing to feel that he could up his attacking contribution, it's quite another to say that he's only done the bare minimum. One is reasonable, the other is utterly laughable.

Seeing as how you freely admit to not having seen enough of Schneiderlin before he arrived, maybe you should abstain from declaring what he can and can't do?
(Oh, and Schneiderlin actually made it into the France team while playing for Southampton, something Coquelin, playing for Arsenal, has yet to do. If he was that much better than Schneiderlin, the surely he would have gotten a look-in by now, no?)

1730~~~
Disagree completely. Right now Schniderlin doesn't offer much other than his ability win the ball which is my entire problem with him. He's shown to be very limited this season.

As far as I'm concerned twenty games or near enough is a fair enough to time for him to have shown glimpses of what he can do. I've not seen him run with the ball with the effect Matic did frequently last season. Does he have the awareness and vision to start counters for us? Maybe he can do all of this but he's certainly not showing it. 

And by your logic, Gareth Barry is a better player than Carrick so I'll just pretend I did not read that. Also, I thought Coquelin was overrated last season but has ironed out several of his flaws this season which has made him a better player.

1731~~~
Some of the opinions in here or mind boggling. I blame the fifa/ FM generation

1732~~~
Schneiderlin at the moment is our best midfielder period. Should be starting every game.

1733~~~
The jury is still out on him for me. He provides qualities we've been missing for far too long such as having a physical presence, being able to win the ball and being energetic for 90 minutes. However I've been underwhelmed by his passing so far and how he panics with the ball when pressed high up the pitch. 

This is just his first season and he's got plenty of time to improve but I'm hoping when Carrick is replaced this summer we bring in a better player than Morgan because I'm not sure if he's of the required level to be a guaranteed starter for us.

1734~~~
So? Even if that is all he offers (which it isn't).

We win games when he plays and lost them when he doesn't. 

God forbid we win football matches.

1735~~~
He's fecking shit. Is he Pirlo? No. Is he Scholes? No. Then he's not United quality.

1736~~~
I'd love to hear what the Schneiderlin-bashers thought of players like Claude Makelele and Sergio Busquets. fecking limited players. Shit passing range. All they do is intercept and pass the ball on.

I forgot you needed to be a Yaya Toure on steroids with the passing ability of Scholes to be a United midfielder. This is the same club that had a central midfield of Park and Rafael once. I'm just glad we have a proper midfielder, who seems to have a set job that many can't appreciate. And he goes about it with minimum fuss.

1737~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

1738~~~
Pathetic. You cry foul if someone uses a straw man against you, but you have no qualms about using them against others.

1739~~~
No. That is exactly the logic you used. Gareth Barry was a regular for the NT despite playing for an inferior club. Don't blame me for calling you out on your shit logic!

1740~~~
He does his job well, it's just you're more likely to think he's not actually doing much in a team where the attacking play is diabolical. And that's not down to Schneiderlin, because by trade he is a <b><i>defensive midfielder</i></b>.

1741~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1742~~~
fecking hell, some have lost the plot.

1743~~~
He does his job very well. I like it whenever he's in the team.

1744~~~
Busquets and Makelele are/were very good at making short passes through the lines and also don't shit themselves and pass backwards when pressed high up the pitch.

I don't think anyone is expecting him to be a deep lying playmaker or anthing of the like, we'd just prefer he showed a bit more initiative on the ball.

1745~~~
Basically the argument against him is that he is used as a defensive midfielders but doesn't play like a box to box?

1746~~~
Exactly. That's my view anyway. We should be looking for improvement in all of our players. Just constant improvement in possession would be good because his defensive game is great.

1747~~~
I find the criticism of Morgan very strange indeed.

Solid as feck, adds power to our midfield and gives us the platform we need to defend well.

It's the players ahead of him that need to up their game.

1748~~~
did someone really compared him to Busquets <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1749~~~
Putting stats aside, we've been a shambles recently against Wolfsburg, Bournemouth and Stoke. You don't need stats to see that the aforementioned teams walked through us on a consistent basis. Is it a surprise that our most mobile and effective DM didn't feature in those games? I think not. 

I've said it all along, our defenders or defending is nothing without Schneiderlin. Even Smalling turned slightly average in those games. Our best players this season ----> Martial, De Gea, Smalling and Schneiderlin. One carries the attack, the rest carry the defense.

1750~~~
Nope, I was simply pointing out that if Coquelin is obviously that much better than Schneiderlin, then surely he should have gotten a look-in by now. I never said anything about ones ability relative to the other, that was you (wrongly) inferring shit.

Besides, that wasn't the only timed you've strawmanned here, so my point still stands.

1751~~~
Apparently this very difficult to grasp for some here. Asking him to improve his passing is calling for him to be the next Scholes.

1752~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

So you just posted that for the sake of posting? You weren't making a point at all! You definitely did not question Coquelin's ability on whether he made the NT or not (You did btw)! Stop backtracking

1753~~~
He's 26, now. In his peak years. I doubt he'd improve his passing much from now. With Herrera and another box to box midfielder infront of him, we'll have a really good midfield three.

1754~~~
Do you have no reading comprehension whatsoever? Here, let my quote myself for you:
I guess I could add, "seeing as he's been playing for a more high profile team." That was literally my point, you massive moron.
And before that, I posted:
Making it pretty fecking clear that I rate Schneiderlin and Coquelin about equally. If you actually had any reading comprehension, or the ability to retain information, you wouldn't have made a complete ass of yourself.

I can't help it if you keep seeing shit that isn't there, but you should probably get that checked out.

1755~~~
Agreed. For years we have been saying that our midfield is too soft and that we need some steel in it. We finally get some and have a player who is much better than most DMs on the ball and people are saying they want to go back to having a softer midfield.

Having Schneiderlin is fine, but Herrera and, most importantly, Schweiny, need to do more in terms of their creative passing. They need to do more than just control games, which should be the minimum for a trio like them.

1756~~~
Surely you only need to watch the difference in our performances with Morgan compared to without to see that he is playing a valuable role?

1757~~~
Saying Schneiderlin isn't a player of United quality is a great laugh. We haven't had a player of his type in years and he's been the best in the league at it for the last three seasons. He's brilliant.

1758~~~
Here's what you posted. The insinuation is quite clear. But whatever..Can't be bothered with this anymore. Hope Schneiderlin improves and becomes more influential as the season goes on.

1759~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Was this a sarcastic post??

1760~~~
Of course it was!

1761~~~
Yep.

While they're different players, Morgan is going through the same thing Carrick used to - he's getting stick for the things he can't do instead of being credited for what he does.

There are five players in advance of Morgan, all of whom need to step up to improve our goal scoring.

There's this strange argument doing the rounds that the holding midfielder we select could be having an impact on our attacking play. Weird.

1762~~~
I really like Schneiderlin in the team. He has his limitations and we haven't seen him reach peak form yet but he gives the midfield an assured platform and stability which the other two players (whomever they may happen to be) should be making more of. He also augments the defence well and we look less vulnerable just through his sheer presence. 

Both he and Herrera give away a few too many unnecessary fouls at times but it is hard to criticise such exuberance and tenacity in a team that often lacks vigour.

1763~~~
Good point on him and Ander giving fouls away, but that's a bi-product of their pressing style.

If those two get a consistent run in midfield we will undoubtedly benefit from it.

1764~~~
Seems like the <i>entire problem</i> is that you have outrageous expectations for a <b>defensive </b>midfielder.

He wins the ball back, he plays the ball wide or to a more creative player. He's doing exactly what he is supposed to be doing. Did you ever watch Claude Makelele at Real Madrid and then Chelsea? Your opinion of Schneiderlin seems to be similar to Perez's opinion of Makelele when Madrid sold him. He said this about him:

"<i>We will not miss Makélelé. His technique is average, he lacks the speed and skill to take the ball past opponents, and ninety percent of his distribution either goes backwards or sideways. He wasn't a header of the ball and he rarely passed the ball more than three metres"</i>

And everyone thought he was mental. Because he was mental. Makelele was being criticised for not doing things that weren't expected of a player in his position by a man who didn't really understand what a player in that position is supposed to do. That Madrid team was livid they'd binned Makelele. He went on to be part of the core of that rock-solid Chelsea side. He was the undisputed best in the world in that position.He didn't score goals, take people on, carve open defences. He won the ball back and gave it to players who can score goals and can carve open defences.

You make reference to Schneiderlin being a "glorified water carrier", but don't seem to realise how important that role is. You say Matic is better because he can "go past people in midfield", despite it not being Schneiderlin's job to dribble past people and isn't to be expected of a defensive midfielder. Dribbling in your own half in front of your own back four would be mad. I'm glad he doesn't do that! It would be like expecting Martial to make more goal-line clearances, and dubbing him not good enough when he doesn't. Not his job.

1765~~~
There can't be any serious complaints with Morgan's work for the club this season.  He was never intended to be a playmaker or a scorer.  Be reads danger, breaks up opposing play and begins possession.  

If there's a complaint to be made it's that we don't do very much with our possession in midfield, but that's a complaint to be directed at the manager, not our midfielders.

1766~~~
If that's all he's meant to be doing then there really is no excuse for how long he actually takes to pass the ball. The man constantly spends an absolute age deciding which 5 yard pass to make, its just an unnecessary addition to how slow our play already is.

Not only that, he all makes far too many pointless passes. There's several times this season where he's had 5/10 yards  in front of him, and instead of just moving with the ball into it, he'll knock it 5 yards to his right, wonder forward into the gap, then receive it again... which again, just pointlessly slow downs our play.

I get that he's there exclusively to break up the play... but that still doesn't excuse being slow/ponderous when in possession.

1767~~~
Yep. Wanting a Manchester United midfielder to be a better passer of the ball and be more positive with it is an outrageous expectation to have. No top team in the world has a player as limited as him in their starting lineup. Bayern, Barca, Real, City, PSG all have much more rounded players in that position. United themselves have never had a player like him. Scholes, Carrick, Keane, Fletcher were all more all rounded with the ball. Not sure what's up with the Makalele comparison. Their problem was as much getting rid of him as it was to decide they did not need that kind of player at all. I acknowledge the need for a midfielder who's defensively good but would prefer someone who's not as limited.

Second, I never said Matic was better because he could go past people. It's a huge plus though when your DM can do that as well being a good passer. I don't expect Schneiderlin to do that and never said that anywhere.

1768~~~
Should be one of the first names on the team sheet, no question.

1769~~~
But the stats show that Schneiderlin is a very good, accurate passer with a decent range. He is statistically our most accurate passer in the whole squad and one of the most accurate in the league currently. But when the stats are presented, you suggest they are irrelevant or skewed or whatever. So it's a pointless discussion.

The Makelele comparison was obvious really. He was a 'limited' player who had a very straight forward role in the teams he played for, and he did it well. Better than anyone. He was incredibly successful with Madrid and Chelsea especially, and was a hugely important player in both sides. Schneiderlin's role in this team is very similar, but that 'limited' role is somehow deemed not enough, which to me, is bonkers.

1770~~~
He's the type of player we've been crying out for since Keano quit. I'm not comparing the two but he adds that bit of steel to the midfield that has been absent for a long time. I can't believe that someone described him as a 'donkey' in the match day thread.

1771~~~
I feel you're still missing the point <a class="username" data-user="69862, @Akash" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/69862/">@Akash</a> is making. His main point which I agree with was Schneiderlin is limited on the ball when compared to other players playing the DM position for the best teams across Europe. With regards to the stats, Tiote, Ki, Birtton and Coquelin have a better passing accuracy this season but guess what they're also limited on the ball. We play in a possession based team so the stats will obviously look good for Morgan but its what he does with the ball that counts and he's doing very little with it atm.

While Makelele was limited on the ball, he was the best ball winner and protector of the back four of his generation IMO. Schneiderlin's defensive game is no where near that level so he can't be awarded the compromise Makelele was.

1772~~~
you doubt that, look at where Carrick was at his 26, we only start to sing hard to believe chant at his 31/32, was always in the shadow of Scholes, remember so many average sideways passing seasons from him,

Schneiderlin is a bit different player and will become monster of a midfielder when using him in high line system, letting him tackle higher up the pitch, and he showed in numerous games he's great passer, he's just restricted too much to the strictly defensive job under Luis van Clown who only seemed before his arrival to get the best out of his player, the only player who he got best out of has been Young and for that reason he's benched a lot..

1773~~~
The passer is always dependant on other players runs or positioning and it's the same for Schneiderlin or even Carrick and Schweinsteiger, it's no mystery if they all struggled in that area, we are wank without the ball our players hide behind opponents and leave the ball carrier with little options.
So while I agree that he isn't even close to Busquets or whoever was used as a comparison, he is also victim of our poor off the ball game.

1774~~~
What nonsense.

1775~~~
*applause*

1776~~~
Carrick's passing ability was always there. He even had the ability to go past people when he first joined.
his passing wasn't average or sideways at all. He didn't have to pass as aggressively/progressively as he did at 31/32, because Scholes/Fletcher were there, but he was always a superb passer. That zip and speed was always obvious. His ability to pass with two quick touches was always there. He just honed it with age.

I have to agree with the comment you replied to: Schneiderlin's passing isn't going to improve by much, if at all. He <i>does </i>take a bit too long on the ball, in my opinion. And, even worse, he doesn't move with the ball while he's waiting for the pass. He often slows down completely. 
I don't know if that'll improve either, to be honest. His levels of comfort on the ball are unlikely to improve significantly at this age.

1777~~~
I'm not comparing their abilities as footballers. I am comparing the restricted role both of them have in the teams they played in. I am arguing that there is definitely room for a 'glorified water carrier' in this team, and that Schneiderlin is doing a fine job at it. Schneiderlin is nowhere near the problem with this team.

1778~~~
I think you're right in that we'll benefit, but Herrera is especially guilty of being overly competitive and regularly seems to get booked and give away stupid, rather than tactical fouls. Hes also walked the line a few times for a red card this season. 

With our current options i'd play both with schweinsteiger, but would they get in arsenal, city, chelsea or spurs teams? Not sure herrera or schweinsteiger do. Maybe schneiderlin. All good options but are they world beaters? No.

1779~~~
I don't like this type of remarks, players don't need to be world beaters, we only need to create the right synergy. Tiago and Gabi, weren't world beaters but they controlled or locked most of their opponents.
Football is a team sport, the only thing that matters is Synergy, judging players individually is useless, excepting/relying on, individual brilliance is often futile.

1780~~~
Yes, the insinuation that Coquelin isn't obviously that much better than Schneiderlin, like you've been claiming, is there. I've never claimed otherwise.

1781~~~
Sorry but the way the Cafs been going the past month, its kind of hard to tell. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1782~~~
Yeah it's ridiculous and even laughable how some on here rate him as "not United quality."

Like you said, the team has been dying for a player of his ilk for years.

1783~~~
Thought he was being signed to screen the back four while our attacking players went at it, not being used correctly imo in a low risk dull system.

1784~~~
He was so good defensively and moving the ball forward. Class performance from him.

1785~~~
I'm sure some championship midfields have great "synergy", maybe we should sign them.

"we only need to create the right synergy" - nonsense. While its important, the players have to be of a certain calibre for that synergy to actually help the club acheive anything, and ours aren't.

1786~~~
I'd argue most of our players are of the calibre needed, though there are obviously areas in which we need to strengthen.

1787~~~
National team caps are not a judge of how good or bad a player is. Coquelin is a much better defensive midfield player than Schneiderlin but your man is perhaps better at passing, moving the ball forward, and other attacking attributes. Coquelin is a better screen for the defence, much like Wanyama was for Southampton. And probably a more limited player who specialises in breaking up play and shielding the defence. 

As for national team caps, Coquelin was in the wilderness- on loan at Charlton - until last winter. He only emerged as a top player in December 2014 or maybe January 2015. Schneiderlin has been on the map for some time now, which explains why one has caps and the other doesn't. Also France have the likes of Diarra and one other guy (forgot his name) at DM. When one of them moves on, Coquelin might get a look in.

1788~~~
Coquelin is pretty unlucky. If it weren't for Diarra's great revival at Marseille this season, I'm sure he would have been called up for France. He is a good player who has improved so much in one year. Midfield is our best area (Cabaye might end up on the bench at the Euros) by far in quality and diversity.

1789~~~
I was merely using national team caps to point out that if Coquelin was that much better than Schneiderlin, you'd expect him to have gotten a call up, though there's obviously more to it than that. It was a throw-away comment that Akash for some reason latched onto (which seems to be a theme with him).

I rate Coquelin and Schneiderlin about the same, though they excel in different areas. I don't agree that he's a <i>much</i> better defensive midfielder, though. Schneiderlin only played B2B last season for Southampton because Wanyama's useless on the ball, but too good of a player to act as a backup for Schneiderlin. As luck would have it, Morgan turned out to be a pretty good B2B mid, so it worked out for them.

1790~~~
Well, If they are sub par players.

1791~~~
I haven't seen Marseille once this year, but keep reading that. How well is Diarra playing? Will he start the Euros behind Matuidi and Pogba?

1792~~~
What a goal that would have been<img alt=":eek:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/eek.gif" title="Eek    :eek:"/>

1793~~~
If he isn't injured, there is little doubt he'll start indeed. Diarra has displayed the most consistent form since August out of all the French CMs. Tackling, aggression, leadership shown in tough times and passing have all been impressive.

1794~~~
Wow what a game he had there <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Mirror reporting that he may also be out against Newcastle.

1797~~~
Is he still talking about football? All I keep seeing is "red zone". What the shite does that mean?

1798~~~
red zone <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1799~~~
NFL term meaning the ball within 20 yards of the n-zone. Why he is using it in an interview about football, I have no idea. That guy has lost the plot.

1800~~~
Schneiderlin's issue is not that he's a limited passer, it's that he's a stupid passer. His pass selection has been really poor in his time here. He could, should and will be much better on the ball than he has been so far. People defending that side of his game this season are simply selling him short by setting the bar so low. Makelele was a more limited passer technically but he used the ball so much more efficiently and intelligently.

1801~~~
I doubt he means that, I think he just means danger zone because Schneids has played a lot of games.

I like the line "I don't take risks"... we fecking know mate, your players don't either.

1802~~~
Red zone is the new "knackered"

1803~~~
I feel pretty red watching our games.

1804~~~
Did he really say that about Schneiderlin or they missunderstood him?

He played two games before and after the New Year and that's about it, his last game before that was more than 20 days earlier.

1805~~~
Surprising he is in the 'red zone' when he seems to have played less games than others.

1806~~~
No it's the new "I'm pulling an excuse from my backside because I'm not going to assume my decisions".

1807~~~
Correct and also "I forgot Schneiderlin plays for us" having only played 2 matches in the past 5 weeks

1808~~~
Wasn't his stats last year really great? In terms of minutes played, distance covered etc... I highly doubt he's a man who frequently finds himself in the <i>red zone</i>. Physically he's probably one of the very best in the club.

1809~~~
Another player LVG is seemingly clueless about and has no idea how he can use him in his team.

1810~~~
Yep.

We should be using him and Bastian similar to how we used Carrick and Fletcher. Morgan is similar to Fletch.

1811~~~
He needs to step up and be more dominant. Newcastle are awful, yet our midfield is struggling at times. You could see that he doesn't have the calming presence of Carrick and BFS in front of the defense. Everyone gets a bit panicky around our box today and the defenders obviously feel the need step out more than they usually do. Still, I'm not expecting that from him. He could and should make up for it with his tenacity and energy but he's not showing any of that today.

1812~~~
He's been completely invisible... if anything Fellaini is having to do far more in our midfield then Marouane Fellaini should ever be expected to do.

1813~~~
It's harder for him since Schweini's not playing there with him.

1814~~~
True. Morgan has been poor so far.

1815~~~
No idea why he isn't playing today.

<span style="color: #ffffff">lol</span>

1816~~~
Needs someone next to him to do the pretty stuff. Fellaini isn't that person.

1817~~~
I think he was still in the red zone. Shite.

1818~~~
Really shit. He's half a midfielder basically... and when he's not next to anyone who can make up for his lack of other half (note: Fellaini isn't that person) he looks completely clueless / nigh on invisible.

1819~~~
Did not look like himself at all.

1820~~~
He isn't the player who turned in excellent performances for Southampton. Maybe the philosophy man has something to do with it but he really has been off form for us.

1821~~~
Did nothing. Newcastle just went through the CM like it didn't exist.

I'd give him a zero in all honesty if I could.

1822~~~
He can't play in a midfield two.

1823~~~
Oh this is exclusively our version of Morgan that I'm talking about... the player I wanted us to buy for Southampton is yet to move to us in my opinion.

I also thought he could have done better to block their third... criminally slow to react.

1824~~~
Tbf to him, Fellaini is the worst midfield partner he can ask for.

1825~~~
Didn't notice he was playing

1826~~~
I was just about to type that. I honestly struggle to remember what he was like at Southampton now. I remember he was really good but after so many mediocre performances I've seen of him, it's hard for me to imagine him being a stand-out player in a game.

1827~~~
Okay, so alot of people on the caf had us convinced he is an amazing midfielder and can even play a bit, pretty much allround stuff and one of the best midfielders in the prem they assured us...

wtf is the shit he is serving up. He has been nothing more than average.

1828~~~
Another player whose position and role in the team are still undefined. Is he going to play as a deep-lying midfielder/anchorman or is he the workhorse midfielder who presses high up the pitch?

1829~~~
So what's the fuss with this guy then? Yet to see a performance above 5/10 I'll be honest.

1830~~~
He wasn't better than Fellaini.

1831~~~
He's made for a midfield 3, just not one with Fellaini beside him. Swap Fellaini for Schweini and we're golden.

3-0 Everton wasn't a coincidence. It was the way forward. Can we find that path again please and start following it again already.

1832~~~
No exaggeration, when they had the replay of the penalty given to Newcastle, I was surprised to see Schneiderlin there. That was an hour into the game.

1833~~~
He needs a better player besides him (instead of Fellaini). Next season, someone like Gundogan could bring the best of Schneiderlin. Also, in the near future a young player like Neves to rotate with him would be good.

1834~~~
was worse actually.

1835~~~
I agree, both were shit but at least Fellaini won some battles, Schneiderlin was invisible.

1836~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1837~~~
Very poor today. Even defensively too. Has to be more authoritative. 

To be fair, I don't think any midfielder can play well with Fellaini in a midfield 2.

1838~~~
I dont think he deserves the hate today, he had good moments and bad as well but people are out of their mind in a game like this tryna blame a first player who they see make a mistake. Calling him worse than fellaini in this game is a joke. Try to put Schnedierlin out of the team and play fellaini there and give it a go other way round and give schneiderlin a proper partner and we are solid again just like we were, fellaini is causing chaos, too slow to be in the right position

1839~~~
He doesn't seem to have the same marauding box to box style he did at Southampton. It was like there's an invisible wall at the final third he wasn't allowed to cross.

1840~~~
I don't think he did badly, he was practally alone against a very physical midfield. Desperately needs a creative cm to partner him.

1841~~~
I think Fellaini was all on his own in midfield.

Schneiderlin was a complete ghost and it's happened a lot this season.

1842~~~
Way too generous. He was against a physical Newcastle midfield and he just went completely missing. At least Fellaini was trying to make his presence felt (and doing a shit job of it) and getting involved in the play (and doing a shit job of it), but he wasn't leaving Schneiderlin isolated at all - they were alongside each other quite often - they were both just too incredibly shit to actually do anything.

If Schneiderlin requires a decent midfielder next to him for him to not be absolutely abject, then that's pretty worrying.

1843~~~
Schneiderlin had only a few bad games as DM and Fellaini whenever was he there we were atrocious not sure if you agree and see what I'm following by this, I guess its pretty clear, but still its my opinion, fellaini was two steps behind everywhere so what he tried he only concede fauls and was never where he should be. His positioning was again off I mean if Van Gaal wants him to attack when we attack okay, but then he shouldnt think of him as someone who could be back first to defend, we were very prone to counters again due to that. Anyways Morgan didnt have a good game, I gave him five as he couldnt impose himself more on the game and wasnt quite sharp as usualy but as a whole pitcure he didnt cause disorganization of the team play, we simply dont know how to pay ith him, he's often at the byline where he's total useless only to lose the ball and await a worrying counter, so NO schneiderlin wasnt good but he wasnt as bad for our teamplay as fellaini was, esepcially defensively while doing nothing offensively, simply a player to spare.

1844~~~
Fellaini was terrible and looks terible beside everyone in CM. Just because he lumbers around making fouls doesn't mean he's doing more work he's just constantly in poor positions and makes bad decisions. 

He's a midfield specialist at DM, there's a huge amount of CM's who are excellent in one particular area and need to be partnered correctly. Busquets would look just as bad when he has Fellaini beside him.

He was excellent for southampton because he was given a specific role in CM and partnered correctly. Whoever told you he was a box to box CM was lying. He is one of the best DM;s in the league and the stats on how much better we look with his inclusion in all areas back this up. 

Fellaini is awful and might have one of the lowest football IQ's I've ever seen, if you really think he was better than Schneiderlin tonight you should give up trying to understand football.

1845~~~
Bravo...  Bravo.. Great to see others noticing this.

1846~~~
No he wouldn't because Busquets would at least do his bit of the job with a degree of competence.

I mean, we've seen Carrick partnered with pretty much nobody in years gone by, and he's still managed to play well in his role.

1847~~~
Carrick was mainly partnered with Scholes/Giggs and even then he had plenty of Utd fans regularly slating him as not good enough and this was in the years he had plenty of pace/penetration and experience along side him. Carrick looks every bit as limited as Schweinsteiger in this United side and it's because of how poor/unbalanced the players ahead of them are.

1848~~~
I'm talking about that "one-man midfield" part of his time with us.

Our style and tactics absolutely limit Schneiderlin, I don't disagree with that... but, on a night like tonight, even if he's not exactly got the best partner next to him, he has to be better then almost completely invisible.

1849~~~
Honestly thought he was terrible. Didn't close down the space, gave the ball away again and again. wijnaldum had a field day getting behind him over and over again.

1850~~~
I've said my part on Fellaini tonight: he was very poor.

Schneiderlin was no better and he gets lower marks from me because he didn't even try to stem the flow. I was happy when he signed but he's not a fraction of the player we bought. Why that is can be debated another time. 

This fanboy attraction certain players receive is hilarious. Knew it wouldn't take long before "you don't understand football" comes up <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1851~~~
I don't think anyone on here who's played football would pick Fellaini to partner them in midfield ahead of Morgan.

No matter how good you are if you have complete shite next to you youll struggle. 

I have no idea why we played that partnership, as it was clearly never going to work. 

Put him next to Carrick or Bastian and there's a reason we look much more solid.

1852~~~
I have seen Darren Gibson and Leon Osman put in consistently decent performances partnered with Fellaini so it really is a shit excuse. I'm pretty sure I've made this exact post before.

1853~~~
Fellaini was constantly out of position making Schneiderlins job much harder. Not to mention he should of been sent off for constantly fouling.

Yet he was better than Schneiderlin? Interesting...

1854~~~
Teams set up to play United completely differently to how they set up to play Everton. A midfield of Gibson/Fellaini was never expected to dominate possession.

1855~~~
He was utterly anonymous, irrespective of how poor Fellaini was. I get that playing alongside Fellaini might hinder him defensively...I understand that. But it doesn't excuse his general lack of involvement in the game. I'm really not sure what sort of player he's supposed to be at the moment. He's not involved anywhere near enough to be a box to box. He often doesn't offer enough defensively to be seen as a genuine anchor man or defensive mid, and he's certainly not particularly creative. He's had some decent performances, but ones like this are incredibly poor and he needs to up his game. Fortunately, it's only his first season and even if he doesn't improve too much, I expect we'll see the best of him eventually.

1856~~~
Fellaini was a better player for you. It takes a bit more to be a competent midfielder for United than for Everton or Southampton. Something Schneiderlin is finding out probably. He'll improve.

1857~~~
Our own side isn't performing a lot better than Everton have in some of their better seasons, to be honest. Although I agree he'll improve.

1858~~~
In a physical game he was actually getting involved, trying to win the ball back, trying to make an impact. For that even though he was shit I put him above his partner. 

What is it that Schneiderlin did?

1859~~~
The pressure of playing for Manchester United is still there though. Mentally it's a completely different thing compared to most teams in England.

1860~~~
So roaming out of position thus losing the teams shape, and constantly giving away stupid fouls is to be applauded?

1861~~~
In the match day thread he said he thought he had a good game. I honestly don't think Morgan Schneiderlin's mother herself would say he had a good game.

His job may have been harder playing along side Fellaini (though as I said, they were actually quite close together a lot of the time) but that still doesn't absolve him from being poor at the stuff that he was doing. Players were just running past him for fun at times, and our defence had zero protection. Obviously Fellaini being there was a big factor in that, but Morgan played his part as well.

1862~~~
I have seen them do it plenty of times though. Then again Gibson is a better passer than Schneiderlin though so maybe that is why it worked.

1863~~~
Perhaps, but it's not as if he's even looking nervy or error prone. He was just anonymous tonight, and while he's generally been a good bit better than that for us, it's not the first game in which he's gone completely missing.

1864~~~
Who is applauding it ffs? 

You are twisting it from one extreme to another. <i>"Oh he thinks Fellaini was better than Schneiderlin so he thinks Fellaini was good"</i>

I said Fellaini was very poor. Schneiderlin was shite. The two worst players on the pitch

I know Schneiderlin has more quality to his game but for whatever reason we're not seeing it. This place was extremely quick to jump on other signings but "Morgan" gets a pass when he's been no more than average.

1865~~~
I'm talking about in general how players who sign for us seem to struggle. And Schneiderlin looked more confident with his passing at Southampton than currently for us.

1866~~~
I think that's more down to tactics/poor management/poor signings than simply being nervous.

1867~~~
Can't see anyone who would rate him after performance like this but when you look at single game our modfield wasnt complete shit when fellaini played there I will applaud you, everyone would struggle, it was maybe this city game last season when we hit top form and everyone was flying so herrera-carrick-fellaini showed us it could work but it wasnt for long, and that game he had special instructions I believe to get on Yaya, next couple of games he was good he palyed further forward, almost like 10ahead of Herrera but started next to him, beside that few games whenever he palyed midfield the other player struggled, whether it was Sweinsteigger, Schneiderlin or herrera. It's no wonder he's shit midfielder and average player used out of his position and he's just causing positional chaos. So yeah none can praise Schneiderlin for todays performance but we can feel for him. He also showed when played with anyone else there that 90% times we were solid as feck and didnt lose games and concede more than two goals like we do with fellaini. so thats that

1868~~~
Most of the time he partners Schweinsteiger. He's been underwhelming then too (Schneiderlin that is )

1869~~~
no that is

1870~~~
He's getting more of a "pass" than some players because he's only been here 6 months and generally when he plays, we don't lose, so he gets less stick.

1871~~~
Was shit. And the 'well he had Fellaini next to him' excuse is nonsense.

1872~~~
What is his "one man midfield time" exactly? 

If you thought we'd signed a box to box midfielder then you were mistaken, I had this debate with multiple posters when we signed him that he's an out and out DM and they disagreed. When he's played in his role with players around him who also have a specific role he's excellent. LVG constantly changing the system/formation/personnel means you will likely never see the best of him unless it's resolved. 


How about making more tackles/interceptions and passes, that's not an opinion either it's a fact you can look up the post match stats. 

There's a lot of nonsense floating around about LVG due to some fans now having an irrational hatred of him such as how he carries a clipboard or doesn't go on the touchline and overuses philosophy etc but his use of Schneiderlin is a major criticism in my eyes and doesn't get enough attention. When he said we had a very unbalanced squad I totally agreed so when some key areas were addressed in the summer along with his love for balance I was pretty excited. Schneiderlin in my eyes was the best DM in the premier league, number 1 for tackles last 2 seasons number 2 for interceptions top 5 for distance covered etc With our lack of physicality and energy he ticks all the boxes and the start he made was very promising because not only did we have the best defence in the league when you looked at the underlying numbers we were on par with Atletico for conceding chances and allowing shots in dangerous areas when he played which has been unheard of for a United team. 

Dropping him vs Arsenal and then subsequently chopping and changing the midfield pairings has been a disaster and maybe now LVG is beginning to realise it. Missing for Bournemouth/Norwich/Stoke and we lose all 3, comes back into the side and we look much better vs Chelsea/Swansea + should have won today. 

The key to a successful midfield is harmonious relationships, having players who offer different dimensions and compliment each other. Pirlo's managers realised he was limited in all areas of athleticism so they paired him alongside Seedorf/Gattuso then later Vidal/Pogba. Busquets has the luxury of playing alongside Iniesta/Rakitic. Matic has Fabregas/Oscar with him so it's little surprise to see people begin to slate his performances when the form of the other two goes down the toilet. If any of Pirlo/Matic/Busquets had to play alongside Fellaini they'd struggle.

What makes Schneiderlin different in my eyes and why i'm critical of LVG is because he was  LVG signing whereas Fellaini was brought under Moyes and Herrera deal was just something LVG approved. I was under the impression LVG would have a very clear idea of how he wanted his side to play but more and more it seems as if he has no real idea how to shape the team and is essentially making it up as he goes along. If you added Schneiderlin to the current Arsenal side were he'd be a huge upgrade on Coquelin you'd see his performances match those of Southampton and significantly improve their title chances.

1873~~~
Quite possibly the most overrated player in the squad. No doubt people will be on here soon enough to tell anyone who will listen that you just don't understand football or how he's a pure DM and all that crap. Almost 6 months at United and I've seen nothing from him to suggest he's good enough for the club. A painfully limited player so far. Needs to pull his socks up asap.

1874~~~
I don't blame him for his performance, it is hard for most players to be in and out of the squad and to be expected to play at top level. Players need match fitness and rhythm to find consistencies which the whole of our team lacks.

1875~~~
It's no coincidence everyone that has played alongside Fellaini in midfield this season has been overrun.

1876~~~
been a staunch defender of him but he was poor yesterday.

1877~~~
Probably his worst outing for us so far, but his good games far outweigh the bad so far, so I'm not concerned. Many saying he was invisible but he still had the best stats defensively in the game. Made a number of good interceptions.

1878~~~
I think that both him and Darmian are suffering from impostor syndrome to different degrees.

The both look uncomfortable and under pressure at times.

1879~~~
I thought he looked fine until the last 10 where he was visibly tired. Could have done with Carrick on the bench

1880~~~
Strikes me as someone who would have played for Arsenal between 2005 and 2014

1881~~~
The thing that sticks out about Schneiderlin is that he seems reluctant to go forwards, even to pass it forwards...he's always passing it sideways or backwards...

1882~~~
Tactics. If you looked at recent matches, regardless of the midfield two combo it's the same.

Morgan is fine playing a bit further afield. He did it for Southampton with big Victor Wanyama holding.

1883~~~
I'm putting that down to LVG, as he wasn't shy about passing forward etc at Southampton

1884~~~
Yeah, he was great as a box-to-box midfielder for them last year, and I'd love to see him play like that for us. Van Gaal seems to prefer him as an out-and-out DM, though, so I'm not holding my breath.

1885~~~
Been crap

1886~~~
Yet Carrick's had no trouble passing forward all season....

1887~~~
They obviously have different roles.

1888~~~
Passing forward is not really a problem. The problem is more that there's absolutely no imagination, no penetration, no decisiveness in any of his passes. Needs to take more responsibility.

1889~~~
They have different skillsets but the roles are quite similar. They're both playing as holding midfielders this season. In any case role has nothing to do with what he said - the idea that van Gaal doesn't want people to pass forward is an easy excuse for Schneiderlin. It's just not true.

1890~~~
He plays a bit shit without Bastian.

1891~~~
Great buy but needs the proper players around him as he is only a small although vital part of the team.

1892~~~
he plays a bit shit with fellaini , hmm I guess I heard it and not once somewhere else..

1893~~~
Mainly Carrick played with Morgan and Morgan has the holding role. Carrick didn't pass the ball forward well vs Arsenal when he played with Bastian.
I'm putting it down to role, Carrick is a better passer than Morgan, but Morgan can still pass the ball, seems to me hes not allowed.
Blind said something about one of the midfielders not being allowed to take any risk with the ball last season, usually the no6

1894~~~
That's exactly it for me, particularly the decisiveness. 

It's not just that he more often then not picks the most unimaginative/least adventurous pass possible (and often a completely unneccesary one)... but also that he takes an absolute age to do it.

1895~~~
His performance thread was almost as hard to find as he is on the pitch. He's gone hiding again. He's absolutely useless at positioning himself to receive a pass in midfield. Our defenders have zero options when they're on the ball.

1896~~~
Horrendous. The moment where he received the ball from Smalling, pondered on it for about 10 seconds and then passed it back to DDG summed his United career up so far.

And I think he was the one to lose possession for the Liverpool chance early in the first half?

1897~~~
His passing has been awful today, those three to Young was horrible putting him in a very difficult situation all the time.

1898~~~
He's definitely not hit his Southampton-level yet. Underperforming.

1899~~~
People always refer back to that Arsenal game for the Carrick-Schneiderlin partnership but he played alongside Schweinsteiger in a few other games and passed it forward consistently better than any of our other midfielders this season. This whole "van Gaal doesn't like passing forwardW is an easy excuse. Carrick was one of our best players last season, in that holding role, and he passed it forward all the time. That's part of the reason he was first choice when fit. As van Gaal said...
<i>
"He is a midfielder who can play the ball forward and that I like. Our aim is always to pass the more forward rather than sideways or backwards."
</i>
I've no idea why people are making excuses for Schneiderlin.

1900~~~
Pretty sure that's what my post, which you quoted, said....

EDIT: As for what LVG said, well since when has he done anything which he has said he would on the pitch in terms of our play

1901~~~
Get off that train.. How can blind be allowed to and Morgan not allowed to? It's simple he takes ages to make that pass and when pressure is applied he looks awful. He just needs to work on quicker releases and seeing gaps before they are closed.

1902~~~
People get very invested in signings and then find it difficult to acknowledge they haven't been as good as they thought they'd be. It's happened with Schweinsteiger and Depay too.

1903~~~
You need to read the next 5 words...

If van Gaal wanted him to pass backwards and sideways he would. It's Carrick we're talking about here. The fact is he doesn't. He passes forward whenever possible in almost every game. Fellaini and Schneiderlin don't because they can't.

1904~~~
Is he making it his goal to be utterly anonymous? Once again, done absolutely nothing. Think it was about 20 minutes in when I had to think as to whether he'd actually done anything.

1905~~~
Literally only comes alive when we are hunting the ball. When his other midfield partner is Fellaini, this shows up even more. When we bought him, I liked the fact that he was combative midfielder who can also play a bit, but he seems to have forgotten how to play this year.

1906~~~
I suppose Bastian can't too...

1907~~~
When Blind played in midfield last season, he wasn't allowed to, he said so himself.
Gary Neville even did a big piece on Blind on SkySports saying he doesn't pass the ball forward, and then Blind made the comment in his response

1908~~~
BTW I'm not even making excuses for him, I think hes been poor. However similar was said about Carrick when he first arrived and played along side Scholes...
On top of that I think the manager is the biggest issue, I have watched Morgan (before he came to United), and to say he can't pass forward is not correct

1909~~~
Not think he's been that bad, he's on his own in midfield and has made some pretty important interceptions and tackles. Possession wise he's been poor but who hasn't been poor in possession?

1910~~~
Hasn't been anywhere near his Soton form for us

1911~~~
I can't pick out a single thing he did today.

1912~~~
It wasn't even that he did much wrong; he just offered nothing whatsoever.

1913~~~
Since coming back he's been really off. Before he was constantly shielding the defence but now I barely ever notice him. Is it the lack of Schweinsteiger?

1914~~~
its pretty normal that cbacks have more time on the ball than DMs, they are pressured much more and play with their back to the goal.

Schneiderlin has been poor today, dont udnerstand what happened to him but hes restricted to playlike himself, saying this gotta admit that hes been quite late to every tackle he made lately, he doesnt focus enough

1915~~~
He is really average, I can't understand the caf's love for him.

His passing is awful for a defensive midfielder, he either plays it to our defenders, and when he is not doing that he is playing most unintelligent passes you'll see. Sometimes we do some decent piece of play, and the ball comes to him and lot of times he picks the worst option to pass to, usually resulting in that player either losing the ball few seconds after or being forced to play it back because he was tightly marked and not available to pass to in the first place.

1916~~~
This is wrong. A lot of our players have dropped off, over the last month or so. Funnily, they're all defensive players. Smalling, BFS, Morgan, Blind, Darmian (a long while back). Schneiderlin was actually really good for us, earlier in the season and it's no surprise that we've still only been beaten once with him in the team. Is it really a coincidence that we lost three in a row since (Norwich, Bournemouth and Stoke) without him and have won 2 and drawn 2 with him back in the side? I don't think so.

1917~~~
Has a lot of improving to do if he's to be anywhere good enough for United

1918~~~
I thought he was worse than anonymous today. Lost too many challenges, gave the ball away cheaply, looked off the pace through-out. First half he was atrocious.

1919~~~
He really doesn't look fit currently.

1920~~~
He started the season in average form, then got into good form for a while, then went off the boil and is currently having a bad spell.

That pretty much wraps up his season so far.

Having Fellaini as his partner can't be helping, but today Fellaini actually did quite well and Schneiderlin was still quite poor. I think once Carrick gets back we'll see him start playing better again, but we signed him to remove our reliance on Carrick and he hasn't really done that. I'm confident he'll come good, but hopefully it'll happen sooner rather than later.

1921~~~
Invisible, sums it up. Didn't do much wrong, but as others pointed out, he doesn't position himself to receive the ball. He looks as mobile as Carrick atm.

1922~~~
Questioned why others thought he was the Messiah last season, that questioning seems justified. Decent worker but not that good.

1923~~~
I felt that he was anonymous today and also anonymous against Newcastle, though as someone pointed out earlier in this thread, with him in the team, we have only lost once. Is this a coincidence? Not sure.

1924~~~
Worrying performance.

These are the games when you want him to stand up and be counted.

Totally invisible and really quite poor. Positional discipline was shocking for someone who is reasonably famed for it.

1925~~~
What a disappointing signing. A nothing player so far. He can't even get the things right that he was supposed to be good at.

1926~~~
had a bad game. Looks better when played beside an actual footballer though.

1927~~~
Been really poor lately.

Not starting XI material IMO.

1928~~~
I expected him to find form much sooner since he knows the PL well. Defensively, he's been doing ok but going forward he should offer so much more

1929~~~
I'm a big fan of him, but he's had two poor games in a row. Not many players have come out of either games with plus points though. I prefer him next to Schweinsteiger or Carrick though. Fellaini was okay in the 2nd half yesterday, but I'd still rather he wasn't in the midfield two.

1930~~~
Big disappointment. Was expecting so much more from Morgan. As was the rest of the Caf I imagine. Hailed as a great signing back in the summer.

Still got plenty of time to turn it around though.

1931~~~
To think he was the one (realistic) signing that I wanted us to make during the summer. He's been poor so far which has been a huge shame.

1932~~~
He's only been poor in his last two games, the criticism is abit over the top. He was injured before that and was rested for the Sheffield United game for a reason. Must still not be fit enough.

1933~~~
I agree, he really hasn't been bad outside of the Liverpool and Newcastle games. It seems like you're only as good as your last game around here, so he's now been awful all season long...

1934~~~
Still only lost one game with him in the starting XI. Add two wins and two more draws to that. He's an important player for us, that's for sure.

1935~~~
He's done ok for us, but for me he typifies our recent transfer activity. A lot of money spent on a player who isn't at the level that we should be aspiring too. Another 25million that we could have done so much more with, IMO. I know transfer fees are ridiculous but yesterday our midfield three cost us almost 90million, and none of them are world class. That's criminal.

1936~~~
“When we came into the dressing room after the first half, there was some screaming and shouting but of course that is normal because in a derby you cannot lose the battle.

“Liverpool are a very high pressing team and we knew if we kept a clean sheet we would have a chance to win the game."

"In the second half we did what we had to do. We scored one goal, stayed strong and, at the end, it is three points which is amazing.”

“David is a very important player in our squad,” added Morgan.

“We are very happy to have him and happy that he didn’t go last summer. He is fully committed to this football club.

“When you have a player like this in goal, it’s good for us because we know we are not going to concede many goals and he is going to make some saves. Well done to him.”

1937~~~
Fantastic player, was a bit anonymous yesterday but didn't play <i>badly</i>

1938~~~
I didn't see that much of him at Southampton, but he's not been the <i>all-action</i> midfielder I expected him to be.

I'm expecting big things from him next season once we get a better partner for him than the aging Schweinsteiger (who's been quite poor himself), Carrick (too slow for a 2 man midfield these days) and Fellaini (just a terrible player)

1939~~~
I feel like he's done alright this season, on the whole. Like his playing style. Was he better than this at Southampton, for those of you who watched a lot of him there before he came? Seems like a lot of people expected more

1940~~~
People need to realise he wasn't the defensive brick wall at Southampton, that was Wanyama.

We need someone of that ilk alongside Schniederlin to get the best out of him.

I think he's been decent though.

1941~~~
Total nonsense, Wanyama wasn't number 1 in the league for tackles and 2 for interceptions over 2 full seasons. He's an excellent DM playing in a very disjointed side. 

Manchester United’s record in the Premier League and Champions League since the 3-1 victory over Liverpool in September:

– With Morgan Schneiderlin:

Played 14, Won 7, Drawn 7, Lost 0. Goals per game – 1.43. Conceded per game – 0.64.

– Without Morgan Schneiderlin:

Played 8, Won 1, Drawn 1, Lost 6. Goals per game – 1.00. Conceded per game – 1.88.

He's our best midfielder and massively important.

1942~~~
The stats don't tell the whole story. Some of the games we've lost without him also coincided with bad form and a spat of injuries that disjointed the team. The other thing is that he has been paired with either Carrick or Schweinsteiger who are far better in taking control of the game.

Thing is, Schneiderlin is quite good but, in the few games where he has had to the main CM, the one to give us that control in the middle of the park and dictate games, he's been found quite wanting. He needs to make that step up to be considered our best CM because right now he is lost without one of the more senior guys around. He definitely makes the ideal partner for either one of them and gives us that energy/legs that we've lacked along side the likes of Carrick.

1943~~~
Even when he is poor.. just by having him in the side, we have more energy and balance.  

Surround him with other top midfielders with legs and I don't think Morgan would be as bad. I think he has a lot of potential but under LVG will not reach it. Either way right now we need him in the side for the legs element.. he's the last player we can afford to drop. This is statistically proven.

1944~~~
The poor form which comes about in games without him are kind of the point, when he's missing the team looks fragile and average. Which games that he missed coincided with a spat of injuries? 

Schneiderlin is a DM specialist like Matic/Makelele not Scholes/Pirlo/Carrick/Schweinsteiger who control and dictate games. Like Matic his ability on the ball is fairly limited which makes it important for him to have a midfield partner who compliments him, just like Matic has Fabregas or Busquets has Iniesta/Rakitic etc Fellaini is certainly not that.

People waiting/expecting him to start controlling bossing games like Yaya will be left wanting for a long time since it simply won't happen. He's an excellent midfielder and in the right system one of the best in the league without question. There's a very good reason Poch wanted him at Spurs and Wenger at Arsenal. Neither of them would be pairing him with Fellaini or misusing him like we have.

1945~~~
I wouldn't say he's been bad, in fact I'd say a large chunk of our better defensive record is down to him. Having said that, his passing ability has proven really poor at times, I've lost count of the times a simple ball has been given away. 

Personally think he suffered most in Europe.

1946~~~
Not helped by the unfathomable gaps that seem to exist between our midfielders. 

I can recall a few instances of him picking the ball up in our half and all of our midfielders were in in the opposition half, surrounded by Liverpool players. Such strange tactics.

1947~~~
He and Fellaini both lack the passing of Carrick and Schweinsteiger. So we struggle to control matches when they are both in there together. He needs someone classier on the ball beside him.

1948~~~
Harsh. Carrick hasn't been as good this season yes, but he <i>always</i> makes himself available for a pass. (Unless you mean dribbling wise he's as mobile as Carrick, if so that's harsh on Morgan). 

Been poor the last 2 matches - but he's had Fellaini as a partner. Whoever plays next to Fellaini in the midfield two, has a poor match. Carrick has played most games with Fellaini and when he does, he looks horrible. Fellaini just doesn't make himself available for a pass and likes to bomb forwards.

1949~~~
Agree. Also I think Gundogan could be a good replacement for Carrick. He can control games. There are other players like Kroos, Thiago, etc but I cannot see them leaving their clubs. For now, a midfield of Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger and Herrera is our best option. I hope to see more of Pereira the rest of the season.

1950~~~
Performances for another club ain't a measure of what you will produce at United. So he's still settling in and hopefully he can reach his Saints levels. I think we'll see an improvement in most our players...next season but then I think LVG will 'retire' so we can rebuild. That said though, how many would have said Rooney's been poor for much of the season? Don't matter at the minute, so he can turn it around still but we've settled on a pattern that will bring limited success this season (if any).

1951~~~
It doesn't help that we keep chopping and changing the team, including central midfield.  At Southampton, he always played with more or less the same players and partnerships / understanding was built up.  We need a consistent midfield 2 or 3 (and a consistent system!) then we'll see players play to their full potential.  Problem is, neither Schweinsteiger or Carrick are physically able to play game in game out.

1952~~~

1953~~~
"Schneiderlin produced, if not his best, then his most pivotal performance at Liverpool. He was gutsy, game and composed, lambasting defenders for playing the ball long when he was prepared to act as the conduit between the defence and the attack.

The irascible Marouane Fellaini, with a temper that could set off a car alarm, offered little defensive nous yet Schneiderlin was ready. Clad in a short-sleeved shirt, he did not need to roll them up."

<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

1954~~~
He actually has to step it up big time

1955~~~
Pool was one of his worst games in a United shirt

1956~~~
This is bizarre. He was poor against Liverpool. Fellaini played better.

1957~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Must be a wum. He was absolutely awful and would have cost us a goal if not for De Gea after showing his lack of awareness for the umpteenth time this season.

1958~~~
Luckhurst is always writing these bizarre articles about individual players.

"Why Herrera is the answer to United's Woes"
"Why Pereira HAS to start the next game"
"Why Schneiderlin is United's most important player"

and they almost always are based on zero actual evidence

1959~~~
He should be played similar to how Fletcher was. He doesn't suit playing as a holding mid. He's better pressing and trying to win the ball.

1960~~~
He's yet another midfield signing that's looking more like a squad player than first team material at United. I really hope he can step up, and maybe he will under a new manager.

1961~~~
Ok, I'm probably tactically naive, but is it really so unrealistic to partner Herrera with Schneiderlin (particularly when BFS and Carrick are out.) I mean, he can hardly be worse than Fellaini, no?

1962~~~
He's been fantastic for me. The stats aren't a coincidence either. Yes he didn't have his best game against Liverpool but then he was next to Fellaini who spent half his time behind the striker, he's pretty much a 1 man midfield trying to screen the back 4 but also press the midfield. 

He can definitely improve and be more confident on the ball, at 1 stage he and Fellaini just kept passing back and forth to eachother, like none of them wanted it. In a 3 man midfield with 2 good passers ahead of him though he would be brilliant.

1963~~~
For that he actually has to put in fantastic peformances which he obviously hasn't done. I'm all for playing up our midfielders, because the attack doesn't help them one bit, and I do think our main three midfielders get excess criticism, however, there's no chance - zero - that Schneiderlin has been "fantastic" for us so far.

1964~~~
Was absolutely fantastic against Everton, suddenly doesn't look so comfortable in the same position. Is that purely down to personnel (Fellaini?) Even his passing looked a lot more crisp and faster.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1W5xc3gHR3w?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

1965~~~
You're opinion, but I can remember many good performances so far. He makes us look much more solid when he plays, and I love the way he presses high up the field rather than letting them turn and run at us easily.

1966~~~
You seem to like us having a player of his sort in our team, but can you remember plenty of "fantastic" performances? Like I've said, our midfield gets some rough treatment here, but this seems to be the other extreme. Being fantastic for Manchester United, IMO, involves performances of a much higher standard.

1967~~~
I can't tell you exactly which match as I don't make a point of marking them down or something stupid, but I've Seen him defensively doing a great job in many games, he just needs a more attacking partner to help him dictate the game.

1968~~~
Without Carrick or Basti next to him he looks hopeless when asked to do anything on the ball.

1969~~~
Anonymous again.

1970~~~
Think he's much better than what he was against Liverpool and Newcastle.

1971~~~
He isn't a leader is he. I am not sure he is 'big time' enough for this level. Needs someone to hold his hand.

1972~~~
At least if we draw 0-0 again people can continue to point to that useless stat about how we don't lose when he plays.

1973~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1974~~~
He's a coward

1975~~~
He tried to provide a creative drive from CM but it's just not his game, he's more of the water carrier for the creative force.

1976~~~
This.

I think he's lost at this level and doesn't relish the challenge.

Well, we're practically Southampton's level now so that was the wrong choice of words I suppose. Maybe the pressure and expectations of this club are too much for him. I really haven't seen anything from him that suggests he's good enough for a club with our ambitions*


*Fans' ambitions. I'm lost at what the board wants at this club

1977~~~
Yes. He's scared to carry the ball even when there's obvious space in front, and generally chooses the easiest route. Backwards or sideways.

He reminds me of Hargreaves. a headless chicken.

1978~~~
Agreed, he has a place in this team, for his defensive abilities, not for the creative side, that's for the other 4 midfielders to provide.

1979~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

1980~~~
He will get better just don't think he reads the game well enough to carry it his duties well. The fact that people were mentioning how good he was doing at the start meant he was awful. It's a position the better you play the less visible you become, clear example Carrick all of a sudden his influence in games is visible because the ball is spending more time in the wrong place.

1981~~~
Blind and Smalling are both better driving the ball forward. And Smalling is like Bambi at times. Hargreaves is a decent comparison. He was overrated too.

1982~~~
Are we all still saying that he is struggling because he didn't have X or Y partnering him in midfield? Or are we agreeing now that he is just a bit average?

1983~~~
Sounds like the football most players have played under LVG this season :P

1984~~~
I can't see him having much of a future here if Mourinho does get the job, I imagine he'll want someone who can offer far more to that role.

1985~~~
Really? I think he'd be one of the players Mourinho would love.

1986~~~
Completely agree.

1987~~~
He never seemed to show any interest in him when he was in charge of Chelsea. Ourselves, Spurs and Arsenal all bid on him.

1988~~~
He had Matic and Mikel to play DM, we had...Herrera?

1989~~~
I've been very impressed with the Kante lad at Leicester who plays a similar role.

1990~~~
He was receiving rave reviews from the caf before we signed him. He was supposed to be THE defensive midfielder we needed. Disappointing so far, but I'd like to see under the next manager.

1991~~~
Yes. For me he makes my Premier League XI, in the defensive midfield role. There's no one better at the moment.

1992~~~
I see your point but I was never 100% convinced on him when we signed him, I think we paid too much for him. If this Sanches is as good as everyone is suggesting then I don't really see a place for Schneiderlin.

1993~~~
Difference is he's been given a licence to do whatever he wants, he's all over the pitch getting forward, getting wide, making tackles and running with the ball. Schneiderlin is allowed to do the ground work but clearly told to stay in the middle and don't do any kind of playmaking, just give it wide or back to Blind. 

I really do think under a manager who isn't so worried about retaining the ball he would come alive.

1994~~~
This Sanches kid is 18. And we haven't signed him yet far as I know. At the moment Schneiderlin and Herrera are our only mature midfielders with both talent and legs (maybe Blind too but he's very slow). I don't think Schneiderlin's amazing or anything but he's easily good enough to play a squad role for us for a few years.

1995~~~
He's not the only one underperforming under LvG.

1996~~~
Definitely. Been massively disappointed with him lately, but he's someone who I don't think we should write off after a first season, and who will hopefully offer a lot more once the team begins to improve.

1997~~~
So, he has gone from "what we need" to "lost at this level". Some of you don't learn. He's a quality player and am happy we signed him. Has his performances been very good lately? No.

1998~~~
Here is as good a place to say it as any. It's fairly clear that Van Gaal's philosophy and system destroys a player's ability to read the game.

When you have to play in a specific area above all else there is no place for anticipation. The system is supposed to do the anticipating for you and the player only has to think about where the philosophy dictates they should be. And LvG wants his players to think for themselves. It's ridiculous. They're stuck trying to figure out if they are within 1m of where they should be. I'm not sure we should be judging any of the players right now. Their poor form is the manager's fault entirely.

1999~~~
Bingo, all the players are in a confusing, muddled mess of a "philosophy" right now.

2000~~~
My observations are based on the role he is supposed to be playing. Restraint is key in that specific role, whether he is a natural at it is another question. It's the same reason why I think he'll get better at it with age.
The instructions you seem to be questioning are actually perfect for this role. In any other area on the pitch this can be seen as a hindrance but for CDMs and CBs this is the way your game should be structured. His role should centre around closing spaces and keep the ball rolling. Like I said the fact he so visible during games for us to even question what we he is doing right or wrong, means he is doing a lot of things wrong. There is a reason why people go on about how a certain CDM is underrated.

2001~~~
I saw a stat earlier this month that in 18 games Morgan has started for us, we have won 7, draw 10 and lost 1. Or something to that effect. Is that true?

2002~~~
Has been fecking shit for quite some time now

2003~~~
One again piss poor marking... This emerges as a big weakness in his play that causes all sorts of trouble for the team

2004~~~
His passing isn't penetrative enough. And his defensive effort lately has been poor. Was at fault for the 1st goal arguably.

2005~~~
Play a drinking game... anytime Schneiderlin does something first time / with one touch, have a drink.

You'll finish the game stone cold sober.

2006~~~
Was at fault for their goal, but Blind's positioning was awful as well.

2007~~~
Not good enough for United

2008~~~

Nobody has the ball as much as him but what does he <i>do </i>exactly?

2009~~~
If you want to get drunk balance it up by having to drink if a forward pass is uncontrollable for a team mate or doesn't hit a red shirt at all.

2010~~~
He looks like he hates passing. Like every time he gets the ball he is thinking, 'who should I pass it to so that I dont have the ball'. The thing is, he showed at S'ton that he can carry the ball, so I dont know why he doesnt do it for us.

2011~~~
Went to sleep for the goal, very disappointing. Didn't have a good first half at all. I keep waiting for him to impose himself on the games a bit more.

2012~~~
Coached not to?

2013~~~
Didn't do the one thing he's in the team for as he's <i>also</i> been rubbish at everything else tonight.

2014~~~
Goal was Smalling's fault

2015~~~
His football brain stopped working since cooperating with Fellaini in midfield.

We all know he's quality but he really needs someone like Schweini to up his game to required level.

2016~~~
Really underwhelmed by him and I thought he would be our signing of the summer. I hope he can sort out whatever it is that's stopping him from reaching the form he showed at Southampton.

2017~~~
Carrick showed what Schneiderlin needs to work on. Always been a staunch supporter of Morgan but he does need to start passing it forwards more.

Would be interesting to see a Carrick - Schneiderlin midfield at some point.

2018~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Get out of here with this fecking garbage.

2019~~~
Needs to improve on the ball. A lot. His passing is very average and always basically takes the safe option, never does those slide passes through like Carrick does all the time.

2020~~~
Yeah. I grew up with people like Ince, Keane, Scholes, Butt etc playing in United's midfield.

I apologise for having high standards ffs <img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

Oh, that's forgetting he's been utter toilet for a long time for us.

2021~~~
He's such a very frustrating player. so negative in his passing, and doesn't track runners. Needs to learn from Carrick.

2022~~~
Poor on the ball again tonight and was partly to blame for their goal, lost his man completely which is supposed to be his strength.

2023~~~
Partly... but the man who scored the goal was Schneiderlin's man to track. Just 'cos Smalling went walkabout doesn't change that.

2024~~~
He was decent in the first half, he has no signs of confidence in him though, he showed numerous times and also for Soton he can pass the ball really well and impose on the game much more than hes showing lately, he just doesnt do it and it might be because of the instructions but still expect more from him.. he will eventually come good I have no doubt about it but I am surprised by how average to his higher standard he's been so far, with a better manager in a better system he will thrive, Bielsa or Pochettino would make him really great player..

2025~~~
You could see the difference when Carrick came on. We need those passes forward to link up with the attackers. Still his first season and at 26 years of age surely he will develop and learn.

2026~~~
Very disappointed in him this season. I don't think it is a lack of ability. He seems a little overawed by the shirt or perhaps he is playing safe because he fears the wrath of Van Gaal. Either way it isn't good enough.

2027~~~
He's too slow. Whether it's taking too many touches to get the ball under control or letting his marker get a headstart. He's a better player than this for sure but he's been indecisive all season so it's not a blip.

2028~~~
Looked very slow running  at times.

2029~~~
Why is he always positioning himself 5 yards behinds Smalling before he is willing to receive a pass from him?

He also spends an age with the ball "looking" to pass forward but pretends nothing is on so he can pass to Smalling.

Thats what everyone on here will tell you. That or "it's not his role, he's just a DM. It's his partners job to do all the passing".

2030~~~
Awful game from him today

2031~~~
Looks like we have been conned by the summer caf muppets. This shit is NOT the fairy tales they tucked us in with during those balmy nights. 

Day by day there was panic that Arsenal might nab him and that United was stupid if they could not spot such an obvious top signing fitting our very needs... Wish Wenger wasn't so stingy.

2032~~~
Feels like we've overpaid for a very limited player. Plays with fear.

2033~~~
Am I the only one that thinks he shouldnt be used as  DM but more of a box to box player? (like if hes playing with Basti/Carrick and Herrera in a three).

2034~~~
He was poor. has been for a while. He was decent earlier though so I think it is probably just a form slump.

2035~~~
I really wanted him, and thought he was great.
Yeah, he's not. Squad player at best.

Midfield <i>still </i>needs three first team signings.
Just three (even <i>two</i>) midfielders who can dribble a bit, pass with a bit of zip and consistent accuracy, side-step a challenge, show a bit of quick feet.

Is that two much to ask for? Even <i>Tottenham </i>have two of those.

2036~~~
Torrid. His form has nosedived, although it could be partly to do with our dire form.

2037~~~
Poor tonight, but I feel we aren't playing to his strengths. I think he needs a passer next to him to see his true qualities. Today we expected him to play the ball out of midfield alongside Fellaini as well as his usual defensive work. I think that's why we see better results with him next to BFS/ Carrick. Let him play to his strengths and what he's good at. He needs an appropriate partner.

At Southampton he was next to Ward-Prowse and Wanyana. Here he is playing with Chesty McAfro.

2038~~~
Gash, get rid

<span style="color: #ffffff">talk about knee jerk</span>

2039~~~
He's really suffering playing 'with' fellaini midfield,  that is to say playing on his own in midfield. We've all seen how he has dominated in midfield previously, he was statistically the best DM in the league two years running of a reason. He needs a partner thats creative on passing like Carrick or Herrera who'll also not disappear for 75% of the game.

2040~~~
Give him a fecking break. I don't think we can judge anyones form in this Van Gaal side. Rooney, Depay, Schweinsteiger, Mata, Young and Schneiderlin as well as others are all players who I feel are currently not playing at their usual standard be it for the better or worse.

Times will change in the next year I am sure.

2041~~~
Said it all along...he's been pretty shite ! Was underwhelmed by his signing.  Don't think he'll cut it at United.  Just a functional squad player, that's all!

2042~~~
Playing in a one man midfield is impossible. It is no surprise that his form has decline since partnered with Fellaini, who is barely a footballer.

He's not someone who can pick up the ball from midfield and set the tempo of the game, but he's forced to do it because Fellaini seems to be playing a different game altogether. With Carrick or Schweinsteigher, he looks fine.

2043~~~
Seriously, the excuses that get made for his bad performances.... If this is the player we payed £25m for then we need not have bothered. 

We brought Schneiderlin to replace Carrick. Not to use Carrick as a crutch for Schneiderlin.

2044~~~
I'm a fan of his talents but he was a shambles. Anyone blaming Fellaini for that needs their eyes checked. The guy couldn't complete the simplest of passes at times and played as if he had a scary monkey in front of his face. Tactically, because this is supposed to be his biggest strength, he was useless. Amateurish positioning and tracking. Shits himself even if under no pressure. At this point in time, our defenders are more comfortable on the ball than him. He realized this and started to leave Smalling all the passing duties of his. 

He'll come good eventually because he's a very good player with impressive physique. He will prove to be a good signing eventually but he's as low on confidence as I've seen anyone at United this season and that's saying something.

2045~~~
Agree.  People keep saying he'll come good eventually?? What the feck did we buy him for?  He's had long enough.  Van Gaal has shipped out better players for less!

2046~~~
He is an important player for us for the future due to his size and mobility. His current performance level is clearly unacceptable but he is just going to have to adapt to the role.

2047~~~
Please tell me, whom did Van Gaal buy and sell after 6 months for less.

2048~~~
Poor today. He's definitely better in games where teams not just hand over their possession to us.

2049~~~
I meant he has got rid of better players than Schneiderlin who weren't given the time to "come good eventually".

2050~~~
Players he got rid of were mostly not 'his' players and that's the first point (bar an uninterested Di Maria who was gash and Falcao that needs no explaining). Secondly, some of those players already had a very doubtful future ahead of them before LvG came and would be sold by the majority on here. He should have convinced Hernandez to stay as a squad player but the question is whether he himself would have liked that role. He has barely set the world alight at Madrid as well and don't tell me you believe he would be scoring here like he does at Leverkusen, esp under this system. Rafael was barely fit, otherwise he would have been given another season (still should have been given a chance) but the point is I doubt it was his ability that convinced LvG but fitness issues. Kagawa was underused before  LvG even came and seemingly wasn't sure himself if he wants to stay the moment Dortmund came calling. Who else?

Schneiderlin has been here for half a season and was decent at the beginning. He hasn't even regressed as much as Darmian has, for example. He has a poor run of form and hasn't expressed himself the way he did at Soton. By all accounts he's fully focused on making progress and is proven in PL. It would be madness to sell him on all fronts.

2051~~~
Still not sure what he's supposed to be doing in the team. Even Fellaini has a visible purpose when he's out on the pitch. More fouls per game than either Fellaini or the scouse thug.

2052~~~
I think he's a player with a lot of energy. As a defensive midfielder we need a good passers instead of him like Schweinsteiger, Carrick or Blind. It's like Juventus when they had Pirlo, Vidal and Pogba. Schneiderlin is more like Vidal than Pirlo.
I would like to see him in a midfield of 3:

2053~~~
Normally I would agree about Smalling going walkabout but centre backs stepping out of the last line to press the ball is clearly an instruction under Van Gaal. Wijnaldum's goal at Newcastle was a result of the same thing.

There was a moment vs Derby late in the second half after Smalling bombed forward when Blind pressed the ball and United had 5 or 6 players goal side of both centre backs.

Such an unorthodox defensive style is why I really worry about the defence under the next manager. For now it means players like Schneiderlin need to be much better at tracking runners.

2054~~~
I am not going to say anything about Fellaini but anyone playing with that plank will suffer.  But Schneiderlin has been really poor of late, his Passing, tackling,  interception just all his general play.  If BFS is injured Herrera and Carrick should get a run out there..

2055~~~
A really really bad version of Pirlo, Vidal and Pogba. Really bad.

2056~~~
Was excellent for Southampton. Done just as well for France. Disappointing in Man United performances in a season where the team look no better almost every other game he played or not. Yes, obviously the player is the problem in question.

2057~~~
This, so much this! I agree that he's been poor as of late, and he deserves criticism for that. But some people are so disgustingly over the top I can't actually be bothered to read player performance threads. So much negativity and animosity towards players who are going through a poor run of form, or who are suffering under the shite tactics. Players aren't being given time to settle, they aren't allowed to go through a dip in form or even have a poor game, they're being attacked for things that have nothing to do with football, and trying not to slam them for every little thing ends up with you being accused of making excuses.

You'd think he'd been a massive disaster going by what people post in here, when he was actually doing fairly well (bar a couple of games) until he got injured in December.

2058~~~
What sort of player was he for Southampton? Was he was more creative and box to box since he had Wanyama next to him to do the dirty work? Still can't figure out what sort of role we need to give him here long term.

2059~~~
Wanyama, not Mane.

2060~~~
Oops.

2061~~~
I didn't think he was good enough for United when we signed him and nothing has happened to suggest otherwise, so I'm not sure why it's even close to laughable?

I was hoping he'd step up as he is at least the type of player we needed, but if anything he looks a worse player than he did at Southampton. His passing isn't good/consistent enough for a team like United and it never has been, so he needs to compensate by offering something else. Losing his man constantly and letting opposition players just run past him isn't exactly the something else you'd be hoping for.

In his defence I'm not sure there is a midfielder on the planet who could cope with having Fellaini as a partner.

2062~~~
He did the dirty work up until Wanyama arrived. With Wanyama being the more limited of the two, Schneiderlin was deployed more as a box-to-box type player after his arrival and was great at it, and was easily their best player.

2063~~~
Morgan Schneiderlin has been the Premier League's most prolific fouler this season. The midfielder has committed 39 fouls in just 17 league appearances.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/revealed-dirtiest-players-premier-league-7274465" target="_blank">http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/revealed-dirtiest-players-premier-league-7274465</a>

2064~~~
I personally don't think he's good enough to be a box to box player. He has limited passing range and doesn't seem to have goals in his armoury.

2065~~~
Needs a playmaker next to him badly - a useful defensive player but limited on what he does on the ball 
Hoping he improves his passing and awareness

2066~~~
Suppose it must also be LVGs fault that he has been rubbish for past few months!

2067~~~
Yesterday it was almost like he was playing centre back, when we were playing out of defence he was always behind the fullbacks.  

Right now he looks like a poor mans water carrier, nothing like a deschamps or makele.

Where does he play for France?

2068~~~
You know I'm one of LvG's biggest critics. However, I'm sure you can't blame LvG for his poor passing, lack of exploiting space in front and vision during the match. Blind and Smalling are having to do the work for him it seems.

2069~~~
Watching this game with a bunch of other United fans last night and the biggest debate was who was the worst as passing, Fellaini or Schneiderlin. We decided Fellaini but man, they are both so poor on the ball.

2070~~~
Correct on the goals and therefore the box to box front: He has 11 goals in his 108 Prem appearances so he is a 1 in 10 games goal scorer, which averages out at 3-4 goals per season. 

Also, not big on assists nor key passes so agree, that is not his role. He is a DM through and through and that is why some of us were so pleased when we got him as it is clear, with Carrick's gradual decline, that we needed a player with those attributes.

I don't think it's any coincidence that his looking worse has coincided with Fellaini being his MF partner. Fella is positionally unaware and combine that with LVG clearly instructing him to push forward as much as poss means Morgan is left exposed more than is ideal. That's one of the reasons why he ranks so high on the fouls tally - when you're outnumbered on the counterattack the spoiling foul is a necessary evil- it's a part of our game that was missing for a while and I for one are glad we have Morgan to add that resilience.

He should be an automatic starter in all key games for us. What we need now is to settle on the remaining make-up of the MF and stick with it. For me Morgan is our best 6 with Carrick as back-up. BFS or Herrera our best options at 8. Mata, Januzaj or at a push Fellaini as 10 (assuming that Rooney stays as 9 and Martial as 11).

2071~~~
I thought he started really, really well, but he has been quite poor since returning from injury.

2072~~~
I'm not making excuses for his bad performances as he's not been good himself lately but I do think it would help if we had a playmaker next to him.

2073~~~
I'm confident he'll come good, but yes he has been disappointing so far.

Now that Carrick is back hopefully we can partner the two of them and let Schneiderlin start concentrating on locking down the defensive side of things while Carrick controls us around the park. Get his confidence up, and then hopefully the rest will follow.

2074~~~
Right now, he is nowhere close to being a worthy successor to Carrick!  

Carrick not only effortlessly broke up opposition offensive moves but also had a world class array of short passing to initiate attacks.  Some of his midfield play between 2007-2011 was sublime.

Morgan is not currently better at the defensive responsibility of his DM position, let alone his attacking requirements.

I'm not saying it won't happen, but he needs to develop his skills a lot more if he is to bracketed along with a younger and in form Carrick.  Certainly he does not deserve automatic selection status right now.

2075~~~
I think he would benefit from a midfield 3 where his job is strictly to protect his defense. Playing in a midfield two at this level demands a passing range he simply doesn't not have. Him and Fellaini is just criminal in midfield if you want a passing game.

2076~~~
He couldnt even protect the defence which is the most important part of his job. He is completely to blame for their goal

2077~~~
I think he is being asked to play like Carrick and that comes with a responsibility to change his whole mind set. He will get there in time but people have to also understand these things take time, he made a name for himself by playing in different way from what he is being tasked to do.

2078~~~
IMO the reason smalling is defending like a wild dog at the minute is because schneirdlin isnt doing the same. The CDM & the 2CB's should be defending as 3 at the back but schneirdlin seems to be the last defender rather than the first.

2079~~~
Was he actually benched? As in dropped? The lengths LVG go to to avoid fielding our best team...

I'm really hoping he was saved for Chelsea.

2080~~~
Don't think Morgan is even remotely in a form that would suggest he should be in the starting eleven every game. He was quite poor the last few games and Fellaini did OK last night

2081~~~
Maybe Chelsea won't be as poor as Stoke though and we will need mobility in midfield. Can't see Carrick and Fellaini doing well against Chelsea.

2082~~~
Agree Schneiderlin hasn't been in great shakes recently but we need him on Sunday, with Fellaini in midfield we'd get overrun.

2083~~~
I am glad van gaal is mixing it up a bit, but i dont like it when he leaves a player out for a month. Once he drops you, you have to wait for quite some time to start again, especially if we are winning.

2084~~~
agreed, him and Carrick to start IMO.

2085~~~
Invisible when he came on.

2086~~~
Invisible and lacking composure and concentration.. A terrible back pass to Smalling who was on the groud which lead to the hand ball

2087~~~
i wish he was invisible , he actually looked shite!

2088~~~
More like rash and pointless. Lunged into utterly shit tackles. People accuse Fellaini of being stupid but this guy is not much better.

2089~~~
He is not suited to LVG's system, imo.

2090~~~
Yeh, wouldn't disagree with this assessment as well. At least Fellaini makes himself a nuisance with his awkward posture

Does anyone actually remember the last time he played well? Because for the love of baby Jesus, I don't.

2091~~~
He's feckin' useless at the moment.

2092~~~
Composure on the ball in midfield at this level is so important, he needs to shape up quickly.

2093~~~
Shits himself all too often

2094~~~
There's something in old Trafford water,  every good player coming here turns to shite. 

Rooney could have been a messi if he drinks bottled water alone,  fatch

2095~~~
Waste of space at the moment

2096~~~
Been very poor lately, really needs to pull himself together.

2097~~~
Im kinda confused in what we are asking him to do.
Is he DM? Or Box to box? Or what?

2098~~~
Its too early to judge him. He's only settling into a team that is expected to win every game, he is not used to that pressure. Hopefully with a new manager and a season behind him, he will be better next season.

2099~~~
I've said this in virtually every game I've seen him play in.
I don't see him do anything good or bad.
I just don't see him at all.

You are behaving like he is 19 years old.
He is in his prime and at his age, he should be expected to perform at his best, from the get-go.
Perhaps under a new manager he will do better, though.

2100~~~
He actually managed to be a noticably worse midfielder than Fellaini when he came on today, which is damming both for him and Chelsea because this simply shouldn't be something that's even possible.

What kind of fecking idiot plays a hospital pass to a team mate who's lying face down on the floor? I would genuinely have subbed him back off again for that. Made it clear he was going to serve no purpose other than being a burden on the rest of the team.

Was he a good player before he came here though? I thought when we signed him it was a bit odd because he never looked that good to me at Southampton. People used to rave about him but I'd watch the same games and he'd seem pretty inconsequential to what was going on at best. Sometimes I'd think he was a bit rubbish and he'd still get ppraised...I thought he might be a good signing IF he could step it up as we need the type of player he is...but he needed to step up and so far he just looks like the same average player I was watching before...only I never noticed how often he gets caught daydreaming when he was at Southampton. Maybe that's something he's learnt from the likes of Jones?

Either way he isn't good enough at the moment. Either with or without the ball. Pretty much every part of his game needs a massive tidying up so hopefully it's just a lackof confidence issue.

2101~~~
He really has to stop sliding into tackles. Just stand your ground and usher them into a zone if you can't get to ball before them. It baffles me how seemingly intelligent looking players can constantly leave certain parts of their game unpolished.
Someone should tell him, he can't be dominant if he's constantly under other players. He should be upright facing them and force them to navigate around him.

2102~~~
Wanyama was the DM in their partnership. But with France he is decent in a limited role next to Pogba and Matuidi.

2103~~~
Atrocious when he came on. That pass back to Smalling when he was on the ground was shocking.

2104~~~
Southampton seem to be masters at selling average players for big fees 

Schneiderlin, Lallana, Lovren, Clyne, Lambert = Almost £90m

2105~~~
Who are the actual good players there to make them do pretty well? <img alt=":o" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie8" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Red Face    :o"/>

2106~~~
Ok... so whats his role for United?

2107~~~
His distribution was vastly better at Southampton, which is what amuses me that he is shitting himself in possession every single time with us. Wanyama definitely wasn't the player running that team.

2108~~~
It seems to be DM, the role played by Wanyama...

In my opinion he is a box to box, he is good when he is free.

2109~~~
To an extent, but he doesn't have the foreign new to the PL excuse.

2110~~~
That's the disappointing thing, of the players we bought he was the one I expected to fit in easiest, but he's been less at home here than the 19 year old from Ligue 1.

2111~~~
Somebody said it before, can't remember who, but he looks like a player who could have played for Arsenal between 2007-2014 or so when they hardly won anything.

2112~~~
I like him a lot, but he's been wank lately.

2113~~~
I genuinely thought he was going to be " the one" for us. hopefully under a new manager. been woeful recently.

2114~~~
I said at the time id of rather signed Wanyama. 

Not great today but I have faith. Morgan is class and it'll all click together eventually.

2115~~~
Fellaini was more disruptive. Perhaps he didn't get up to speed of the game but to be worse than Fellaini doesn't bode well for the rest of the season for him.

2116~~~
His form has completely disappeared. Needs to sort himself out quickly.

2117~~~
Before he joined us I thought he'd set this place on fire. I'm going to blame this on the tactics or something. How can I player go from being so good to being so crap? There's a reason almost all our players except for De Gea are playing so bad. Have they all been philosophized?

2118~~~
He's a box to box player & now he's more like a static DM with us (based on instructions probably), he's not a thinker like Carrick or Schweini, so, of course, his performances wil be affected by that. He's more instinctive, or gung ho etc. If we allow him play that way, we'll see the real player in him. He's a fantastic player going through a bad patch, I'm not that worried.

2119~~~
Depay is getting a lot of flack (fair enough) in his thread for the incident leading up to the goal... but what the feck is Morgan doing up there anyway? We're trying to defend a one goal lead... he's brought on as our defensive midfielder, surely the only thing he should be interested in is sitting back an shielding the defense?!

2120~~~
I think that it's tactical because I've seen three Schneiderlin in the last 2 years. The first is the Southampton B2B, he is very good in his passing, running and pressing game. Then I saw Schneiderlin the DM for the french team, with Cabaye he was bad, with Matuidi he was good, finally I saw him play as a pure DM for United and he is bad. Schneiderlin isn't a defensive player so he is best when he shares the defensive work, he isn't a covering midfielder either, he is the type of midfielder who will run at the ball carrier and we are asking him to do the opposite.

2121~~~
He was doing his job, which in that particular attack (the one that lead to Chelsea's equalizer) was tracking Willian. And had Memphis not fecked up the simplest of passes, Morgan would have probably put all three points in the bag, just before that. And for all it's worth he rushes back, after he has already sprinted at the opposite end of the pitch, and he marks his man.

We were forced very deep because, with the introduction of both Pedro and Hazard (plus Fabregas in a free role) Costa had someone to link up with. And all of three of them were playing very centrally, so Morgan and Carrick had to keep an eye on them. What we needed was better hold up play but with Mata, Memphis, Rooney and a rather tired Martial, we were just giving them the ball back. Any good possession side would have put the game to bed long before the 91st minute, considering the risks Hiddink took in the last 20 minutes of the game.

2122~~~
The only Schneiderlin I have seen is in our team. I thought he was a DM and we bought him for that specific role. Now I read people saying he's a B2B CM. So, thats him, Herrera, Fellaini and I guess Blind and Schweinsteiger best as a B2B. Isn't that guy Sanches the same too? Am I on the wrong track here?

2123~~~
<b>14/15:</b>

1 DM - 2 games

2 DMs - Alderweireld / 2 games
2 DMs - Wanyama / 10 games
2 DMs - Davis / 3 games
2 DMs - Cork / 1 game

2 CM's - Davis / 6 games

So he's almost always played alongside a midfielder. Played with Wanyama the most when utilised as a Defensive Midfielder and played only with Cork when used as a Central Midfielder. When used as a CM, Wanyama was used as the DM. So I would say that Wanyama was used as the genuine DM and Schneiderlin used as the more attacking player. So what that suggests is that he needs a player like Wanyama to get the best out of him and the closest we have is Jones, but he's made out of glass.

We basically need a Wanyama type signing to fill in at DM imo. I actually think its an obvious hole in our squad atm.

2124~~~
Was that stat put 'on-call'? It must have took you some time to gather.

If he needs a DM then there's a problem since in addition to a DM we need a CM and AM as well.

2125~~~
He doesn't need a DM, he is like Atletico Madrid midfielders. None of them are DMs, they all play as B2B and share the defensive work, put someone like Kondogbia, Matuidi or Saul next to him, give them group instructions instead of individual instructions and they are fine. I think that currently we are emprisoning players in boxes and they are not comfortable in them.

2126~~~
There's still hope then.

In your opinion, will he be first choice for United or a rotational player at best?

2127~~~
He could be a starter in the right system. The problem is that LVG is using him as if he was Van Bommel but he isn't, he is the same type of midfielder than Gabi, Tiago, Saul, Kondogbia, Nainggolan, send him to Atletico and he will be fine, but with us I don't know.

2128~~~
Disagree. The whole point of having a squad is providing the Manager with options for tactics. Currently we have no player that plays with defense in mind (look at Dier for Spurs who plays as a holding DM). We have no player like that at all, Schneiderlin will never be that kind of player, none of our current midfielders are. This is the reason why when we play more open football we get carved apart on the break because our midfielders simply aren't good enough defensively, none of them have the defensive instinct to cover in the right areas. The only one who does (Carrick) simply isn't mobile enough anymore to play that role.

What we need is a Dier type player who will cover areas of the pitch while our fullbacks/midfielders press up the pitch. The only player we have in our squad that can play in that way is Jones.

You mention Matuidi but he has Motta in DM. Inter have barely used Kondogbia as a DM and Saul has been used on the wing mainly this season as they've been using Gabi and Fernandez as deep lying DMs. 

I'd be looking at players like Medel, Gustavo, Fabinho etc

Use one of those as the holding DM. Then use 2 of our existing CM's infront of them. Provides more balance imo and makes the game easier for players to understand as they'd know that the holding DM will always cover allowing the midfielders to worry about the attacking play. That's just my opinion though. I think there are times when you look at our side and the players have no real understanding of what they're meant to be doing. Who's meant to be covering, who's meant to be attacking.

2129~~~
We can't keep on buying players to cover for multiple weaknesses of existing players in the squad. That's how you end up with players who are decent but never good enough for the standard we need to aim at. If we need to buy another limited CM to get the best out of a very limited water carrier then we might as well set up camp for 4th place (If that) for the foreseeable future.

2130~~~
I don't know how you can disagree with something I haven't said. I said he doesn't a DM which is different from we don't need a DM.

2131~~~
Maybe try play Blind alongside Schneiderlin?

2132~~~
But it's the same for all of our midfielders though Akash. They're all of the same mould, they'd all like to push up the field rather than sit back and shield. What we need is to stop buying the same type of midfielder and go for someone who will sit back and shield our defense. We used to be able to rely on Carrick to do that job because despite him not being great at tackling, he was very good at covering the right positions and intercepting. But he's 34 and he's been immobile for a few seasons now it's no real surprise that we get better results when he is played though.

I have no doubt in my mind that if we bought an actual defensive minded midfielder we'd not only have a far better balanced first team but we'd look more stable in defense and better in attack as it frees up our other midfielders. Schneiderlin as proved at Southampton would work very well alongside that type of player which then allows us to play a more attacking player in front of them in a 4-2-3-1 formation. Would he do as good a job as Herrera/Schweinsteiger etc i'm not sure.

Well yeah could do that if we sign a replacement CB. That would be an option.

2133~~~
That's what I would try. But that would require Rojo or Jones (ha) getting back fit to play CB.

2134~~~
Or you change the defensive schemes, you don't have to play with a recognized DM, Atletico doesn't play with one and the Midfield Pogba-Vidal-Pirlo didn't had one too. Thiago Motta like Carrick are deep lying playmakers, you can use this type of player or you can just fill the team with grafters and let the entire group of midfielders shield the defense, there isn't one way to protect a defense.

For example, it's perfectly possible for us to play with a flat midfield made of Blind-Schneiderlin-Herrera, they respectively protect the gap between the LFB/LCB, LCB/RCB and RCB/RFB, on top of that you defend with a narrow back four where the fulbacks defend aggressively from inside to outside and when the ball carrier is in the channel, Blind or Herrera trap him from the inside and the "winger" traps him from the top, obviously you need grafters to do that and a lot of tactical training.

2135~~~
I'd always have a defensive minded midfield player either on the pitch or on the bench. That's just my opinion and currently we can't.

2136~~~
I agree that gives you options, but that wasn't the point, the point was on how to make Schneiderlin relevant.

2137~~~
And that's the big problem isn't it. And not just with our midfield. We have a striker who cannot score, #10 who cannot create, a defender who cannot defend and a winger who cannot beat his man. It's a farce. What you are suggesting is fine but just look at how it sounds. You're saying to we need to get in a defensive minded limited player to get the best out of another limited player. That, for me, is unacceptable. We should be going out and buying a player who's defensively good and is good the ball. Not trying to cover the weaknesses of our current players by signing even more dross.

2138~~~
Yes and that imo is to have a defensive minded midfielder sat next to him. That's my opinion. How we've used him so far hasn't worked, it hasn't really worked with Herrera either.

2139~~~
If that's the case it will never work for him at Utd. He isn't anywhere near good enough on the ball to play with an even more defensive player than him.

2140~~~
Don't agree with that. Dier is a fine example of a defensive minded limited player who allows the rest of the team to play. It's about balance and tactics, just because you may decide to use a DM doesn't mean it's a drawback and a failing of other players. It's how we used to use Carrick and he went through most of his United career unloved by the masses because of having that label stuck on him. Balance is the key word in football and often where most teams fail at. They go for the best players and not the best balance.

2141~~~
Your solution will only expose everyone, it will expose the DM defensively and Schneiderlin offensively, Herrera and Schneiderlin are hybrids and we ask them to play like specialists that's why they are not doing their best, we need to change the dynamic of our midfield, bring an other hybrid and play him with the other two, bring a winger that can beat his man like Martial does on the left and bring a striker in the ilk of Griezmann and we will see a different team.

Our team is more Atletico Madrid then Barcelona but we are still deluding ourselves.

2142~~~
Defensively we need to revert to 3 at the back.  

If we get an LCB then surely blind can play a toggle between CDM/CB.  In fact it wouldn't suprise me if he turned oht to be the best at it.

2143~~~
Jesus no.

2144~~~
Not permanently as in change our formation.  When we defend - the extra CDM needs to play in front of the 2 central defenders & mimic 3 at the back.  

Blind has shown enough times that he can move the ball out from the back to help speed up our attacks.

2145~~~
Why on earth does he give away soo many unnecessary fouls? He's done it many times this season and when he came on against Chelsea he did it a few times, right on the edge of the box too. Absolute stupidity - brought on needless pressure.

2146~~~
I think all of this talk about having to adapt formations and tactics to get the best out of him is slightly worrying. It's not like we're talking about changing the makeup of the side to accommodate a Neymar or Messi. He's a workmanlike midfielder who should be able to do a decent enough job anywhere in the centre of the park. The fact that he can't says to me that he's just not that good. He's been absolutely anonymous far too often this season and just hasn't worked out so far.

2147~~~
Dier is not a very good example at all. Look at the four players in front of Dier against Watford - Lamela, Eriksen, Chadli and Dembele. All of them attacking midfielders and good with the ball. 

What you are saying is we sign someone even more defensively minded than Schneiderlin and play him further forward. This might have worked had Schneiderlin been good on the ball but he's not even close to any of the Spurs as far as his ability on the ball goes. It would be far too defensive and limited.

Carrick is the example we should follow i.e get someone who's defensively good and very good on the ball to go with it.

2148~~~
Diers played alongside Carroll a fair bit this season and tends to partner up with Dembele. Dier sits back while Dembele moves forward but he doesn't venture as far forward anymore than he used to at the start of the season. Herrera imo would work very well alongside Blind for example replicating the same system. Schneiderlin would do the job as long as he regained his passing form from Southampton. But if we're playing tough away games then switching out Herrera with Schneiderlin would work well imo.

I think ultimately the issue at the moment with Schneiderlin is that he's struggling to get back to his Southampton form. He was a decent passer for them but has struggled a bit recently. It's only a blip.

2149~~~
He was good when he played with schweini. Because he could be the destroyer and schweini used to take care of passing, linking attack and defence and running all around the pitch in support of players. Neither Fellaini, Carrick nor Herrera does it well enough like schweini does.

2150~~~
I think he's done pretty well, good positioning wise, crisp in tackle and plays it first time, quick, doesn't take 17 touches like maestro Carrick

2151~~~
I think we always look poor in midfield whenever he's playing, his passing ability is awful. 

I hate to say it but from what I've seen this season, Fellaini is a better option.

2152~~~
His use of the ball is abysmal.

2153~~~
But he tends to play it sideways unlike Carrick who usually tries to look forward.

2154~~~
Rubbish. He's been better than Carrick so far. And the goal came from a great forward ball to Martial.

2155~~~
yeah and thats why he played more forward passes than Carrick <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2156~~~
For all his failings at least Fellani doesn't look inhibited by the shirt.

2157~~~
Poor as usual. 

He just crowds out Carrick in the centre of the pitch instead of giving Carrick space to play.

2158~~~
Apart from couple of passes he's been good.

2159~~~
Him and Carrick have been terrible in the middle so far.

2160~~~
He looks so nervous.

2161~~~
We're a far better team with Carrick in it, amazing after coming up to a decade that there are still United fans that don't get him.

2162~~~
He's not bad he's just really safe, doesn't offer enough.

2163~~~
Looking worse and worse, as are most of our squad.

2164~~~

ffs, its clear he cant play at top tempo, games like this, against Arsenal and many others showed complete opposite. I think he's gonna have a good game 10 years after his retirement

2166~~~
Woeful. Would rather have Cleverley playing.

2167~~~
Has this amazing ability to completely disappear during a game.

2168~~~
We got conned by the summer transfer muppets. Gotta laugh at the uproar in that Schneiderlin thread day by day that we hadn't wrapped up the "most obvious quality signing for this United side" and how scared people were that he would just join Arsenal.

2169~~~
Really thought he'd be a superb player for us immediately.

2170~~~
Like playing with ten men.

2171~~~
He's the defensive midfield version of Lovren.

2172~~~
Invisible.

2173~~~
How has this player fallen so far and so quickly. He was excellent for Southampton and he seemed like he was going to be good for us early season. He offers absolutely nothing to the team at the minute. Nothing going forward, nothing defensively. No intelligence on or off the ball. He looks so out of is depth. So disappointing as he seemed to be the signing we had desperately needed when he arrived. He is just a passenger in the game time and again now

2174~~~
He is doing feck all there in the middle

2175~~~
What a nothing player he's been for months.

2176~~~
The signings LvG has made has mostly been shite. Well done.

2177~~~
Southampton are pretty crafty for the most part when it comes to selling players. Surprised he is struggling. I thought he'd be one of United's better players this season. Maybe he's not being used correctly?

2178~~~
This is so true. I won't be surprised if the new manager that arrives tries to discard him in the summer.

He reminds me so much of Cleverley while he was here in how he deliberately hides in games especially on the ball.

2179~~~
Looks awful, seriously awful. Yet another failed transfer, He was really good at Southampton at making tackles and intercepting but that's all gone. It just keeps happening over and over again, players coming here and completely bottling it.

2180~~~
Unban sam and let him explain himself for wanking over this guy and relentlessly lambasting United for not wrapping this transfer up. 

He is the definition of a nothing player. He literally does nothing for us.

2181~~~
He seems to be visibly shrinking game by game. For all our acquisitions, midfield is still a problem.

2182~~~
He did have that patch earlier in the season where he was doing fairly well. Obviously he's been average (being kind) for most of the season, but I'm still fairly confident that he will go on to be an important player for us for many years to come.

2183~~~
He's a wallflower at the moment. I think a manager like Mourinho would get him to perform as we've been hoping.

2184~~~
It's difficult to judge players when they're all collectively playing shite.

2185~~~
Besides the art of tackling, I think he's worse than Fellaini in every aspect of the game. Most posters know what I think of Fellaini. 

On paper he seemed to be the ideal signing for United in the summer.

2186~~~
I think the right new manager will lift these players tenfold. They look demoralised.

2187~~~
Budget buy - budget results.

2188~~~
He's been so disappointing this season, offered nothing again today.

2189~~~
I mean this in a nice way, but I still dont know what his aim is? What is his position? 

I work with a Saints fan who keeps telling me were using Morgan wrong and he should be more box to box than just sitting. But right now, if hes sitting, this means were playing 2 DMs against Sunderland <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

His passing is poor, and he looks little lost at times in terms of where hes meant to be.

2190~~~
I thought he was a really good player. He's not.
It was just me (and many others) getting excited about the player we hoped he would be, not the one he actually was.

The midfield is <i>still </i>in horrible shape.

2191~~~
Did he really play a big part in Soton's game when he played there? Because he's not doing anything proactive here right now. He isn't a threat going forward, his passing is limited to 10-15metres.. And the most disappointing thing is that when we lose the ball and have to defend a counter, he's nowhere to be seen helping out his WB.. That's absolutely unacceptable and very depressing.. 25m is a lot of money even in these days..

2192~~~
I have to admit, I was one of his stout followers. I thought finally we have someone that is going to dominate midfields and become one of our most important players. But he's been such a huge disappointment. <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

2193~~~
Southampton played a more frantic game. And clearly it flattered him, as well as others in that team.
Players with less skill will usually look better in more frantic, high-tempo football matches/teams, where the ball is being tossed about and both teams are losing their shape constantly. 
And there are too many of those low skill-players in this squad.

2194~~~
Did feck all today. He and Carrick should not be playing together unless we're looking to smother an opponent to death. Should've been off for Ander.

2195~~~
So excited when we got him but he hasn't been it yet. Hope he can step up.

2196~~~
Before that period he wasn't starting (was it an injury? I can't remember) he actually looked a lot better. United were in great defensive shape and he wasn't so scared of the ball like he is now.

2197~~~
Most of the caf built him up as the ideal DM signing last summer, but right now, he's right up there as one of our worst players. He genuinely looks unnaturally uncomfortable with the ball ATM.

2198~~~
Widely regarded by their supporters as their best player for years.

2199~~~
Shown the backbone of a paraplegic jellyfish in the last couple of months. I have to hope this is just down to his confidence being shot. Otherwise we've wasted another £25m on absolute shite

2200~~~
Failed to show up again today, seems to be quite a regular thing

2201~~~
I'm not sure if he was less bad than Carrick today or whether it was just that he was doing so little that I didn't notice him doing things wrong as much.

The real mystery is how his inexplicably shite cameo last week earnt him a start in the first place.

What's the point in expecting any standard of performance from players when being absolutely terrible earns them a place back IN the team?

Still yet to see a performance from him either before or after signing for us that suggests he's actually a decent player. All he's done so far is make me go from being a bit miffed where his reputation came from, to completely baffled.

2202~~~
Well Fellaini got injured and LVG doesn't like Herrera so I guess that's that.

2203~~~
I'm lost for words. I was so happy when we signed him and Darmian, yet both have been woeful for a long time. I don't understand.

2204~~~
They will both blossom under Mou

2205~~~
I say this after every match which he plays.
What did he actually do during the match? The invisible man.

2206~~~
Not fair to judge him or anyone under Van Gaal. Over two seasons, the only person who's actually thrived under his leadership is the one who has had the least to do with Van Gaal and his coaching. i.e. the goalkeeper.

2207~~~
It's embarassing though. We have a manager who seems to deliberately make our team worse. Even if for whatever reason Schneiderlin seemed a better option, the time to admit this was a very obvious mistake and change it was lliterally after about half an hour. 

I was in no way expecting both Schneiderllin and Carrick to come out for the second half. It was so obvious we neeeded to change things there...I mean even without Herrera I'd have moved Blind up and just found someone else to play in defence. It was either that or basically just accept not being able to win the game...which is what we did.

2208~~~
That's probably right to a degree in fairness.

Van Gaal managed to turn Di Maria into a pub player so it's not a stretch to think he can do it to pretty much anyone else.

2209~~~
This guy is really the one thats really baffles me out of our summer purchases and his form for us.
Darmian, new country, loss of confidence, I can understand...
Depay, young kid, new country, 100x harder a league.

What the feck is Schneidlerlins excuse? don't tell me he's not good enough, he's been a top quality performer, week in, week out for Southampton for the past 2 years.

2210~~~
He's a good player and still one of the best DMs in the Prem.

He's a victim of LVG's turgid football and the below par players around him. Mourinho will love him and flourish.

2211~~~
Gary Neville waxing lyrical on Sky Sports. I'm going to wait if he turns out to be decent under a new manager before going all **** on him.

2212~~~
Yeah but I remember him going on about how well he was playing against us once, and being confused because he was actually quite rubbish. We were just going through their midfield all game.

2213~~~
I think many noted that he was more of a defensively great #8/box-to-box than a pure defensive midfielder or deep-lying playmaker. Taking over most of the defence-screening burden in midfield for a more attacking team was always something he had to adapt to.

2214~~~
He's not good enough to play for the club, he has been a passenger in pretty every single game he's played in. He was giving it the big I am and wanting to leave Southampton to move to a bigger club and now he has he looks overwhelmed and completely out of place.

2215~~~
His season has been worse than Fellaini's debut season

2216~~~
No!

-------

I'm convinced Schneidi will come good. His early season form was good (not great), and he's dipped since the turn of the year...but then again, these are players under LvG. Replace the manager with someone who isn't so rigid and pig headed and he'll come good. I'm sure of it.

2217~~~
His ability on the ball has pretty much died. Thats not LVG's doing, thats just him being crap.

I hope he can still come good though

2218~~~
Its his first season but he does have EPL experience unlike Depay and Darmian. Watching him though I can't help but remember reading up on here about how SAF was adverse to DMs, he felt to be a United CM meant being a well rounded player. Morgan seems like a pure DM indeed and they've proven their worth throughout world football, he just needs to play in correct combination.

2219~~~
I thought he was worse than Herrera when he came on. 

Well maybe not worse, but did you even notice him on the pitch? He just goes into hiding. It's frustrating.

2220~~~
Came on to add some steel according to Trevor Francis......that is a metal, right?

2221~~~
I'm totally baffled when he's brought on late in the game.

What's he going to do? Either start him or bring him on for an injured player if you have to. He's never going to change a game or particularly lock it down.

2222~~~
Probably the most disappointing signing of the season

2223~~~
This guy doesn't deserve his own thread.  Should be closed and he can feck off.  I said he was shite from day one and he's just getting worse.  An absolute waste of £25m.  Makes me sick when I think of the players van Gaal turfed out for the likes of Schneiderlin, Darmian and Depay.

2224~~~
I honestly dont think we will see the best of him (likewise with other players) until LVG moves on.

2225~~~
It's take your pick at moment. Besides Martial, all of them look shit.

2226~~~
Was flabbergasted when he was brought on. What a negative substitution. Should have been Pereira.

I expect he will be much improved next season (not much to base this on, just a hunch) but he has been really disappointing so far.

2227~~~
Pointless substitution, agreed Pereira should have come on instead.

2228~~~
Has someone told him the ball has a contagious disease? He just looks so jittery in possession. At least he made some decent tackles tonight.

2229~~~
Been impressed with him in this half. Like Memphis, it looks like his found himself in his game. Remembered who he is and who he plays for.

2230~~~
Looks like someone kicked him up the arse today. He's involved a lot more in this game.

2231~~~
one of his best games, our overall performance goes up with his, just need to maintain this hunger and focus and he will be great..

2232~~~
Much better.

2233~~~
best half in a Utd shirt, this is the real player!

2234~~~
He's bossing in there right now.

2235~~~
He's had our best chances. Play him up front.

2236~~~
<a class="username" data-user="64699, @entropy" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/64699/">@entropy</a> wrong thread mate.

2237~~~
Genuinely shocked. He was adventurous, imposing, not a coward... it was a normal, combative midfield performance. Now do the same thing on Sunday.

2238~~~
He played how I expected him to play when we signed him.

2239~~~
Far better than in recent weeks.

2240~~~
Exactly... which is why I'm shocked!

2241~~~
I still hate him for coming here and costing us so much money.

2242~~~
He bossed it today. Instead of staying back, being cowardly and passing it sideways he was so much more adventurous today. Today was probably the first time since the Everton game where I saw him in the box and having a shot. And he did it like 4 times!

2243~~~
He was all over the park tonight, hunting down every ball and involved constantly in breaking it up and getting it in quickly to our forwards, probably his best all round game for us.

2244~~~
Took a quarter of the game to get fully horny. Then bossed it

2245~~~
That brilliant sliding challenge in the first half led to our first goal. He had a really good game. Had 3 chances to score as well.

2246~~~
Yeah that was a full bossing in there today. Every time the ball broke from there area I was saying "Morgs" in my head and he would just appear. Great game.

2247~~~
Great energy from both him and Herrera today. Very mobile midfield.

2248~~~
Still feel he can do a lot better with his passing. During the second half he misplaced a pass and quickly won the ball back, which about summed him up. Hopefully he takes confidence from this and improves.

2249~~~
Very good performance. He's brilliant at closing players down and winning the ball quickly. He's much less effective when referees are quick to call soft fouls on him, so he definitely benefitted from the officials tonight!

2250~~~
A much better performance from him tonight. 

Was getting in tangles with the opposition and coming away with the ball.

2251~~~
For me he is out most important midfielder. His aggression and ball winning ability is vital. There's a lot of potential in this Schneiderlin Herrera partnership.

2252~~~
Good to see him push forward for once, had a couple of decent efforts too.

2253~~~
I think this is it. I think next to somebody static (like Carrick) it doesnt work. Next to Herrera, they can both get up and down and cover for each other. Ive been wanting this tbh (with maybe another midfielder -  one of Carrick or Basti with them in tougher games but these two against lesser teams).

2254~~~
Nearly scored a brilliant goal with that scissor kick.

2255~~~
The new Cleverley & Anderson? <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2256~~~
Lets be honest, we all loved them for that really short period :P

2257~~~
Like everyone pointed out, his best game in a United shirt. Hope this is the kick he needed to re-ignite his career here. Loved how energetic, direct and attacking he was today. Really wanted that goal

2258~~~
Brilliant game from him - it doesn't matter who the opposition were, he dominated the midfield and looked very positive on the ball. Would have been my MOTM if it wasn't for Memphis. More of the same please!

2259~~~
Fortunately, injuries will likely force us to play the sort of midfield we should have played against Arsenal in fecking October or whenever it was. I still can't get my head around not starting Schneiderlein away at Arsenal. If you won't play him in that game, then you shouldn't play him at all.

Now we will likely have Scneiderlein and Herrera on the pitch against the Gunners as we should do, as opposed to the geriatrics.

2260~~~
He threw the shackles off, totally different performance than what he played the whole season. Happy to see our coaching stuff not restricting him. He was everywhere, thats how he should play, and not sit deep and play it safe and anxious. He was so uncomfortable in that previous role, lost all confidence.

2261~~~
I agree with you in principle. The problem is that both midfielders already have already played two full games this week. I can see them running out of steam and getting over run fairly early

2262~~~
You're right. The only thing that may help is that they have had two relatively easy games, while the Arsenal lot got basically dragged all over the pitch for 90 mins themselves.

I know it probably doesn't work like that!

2263~~~
Van Gaal:

<i>“They are stepping up all the time, but nobody is talking about Schneiderlin and he has just played his best match by far. I’m happy for him, because some players never get the spotlight and that’s a great pity.”</i>

2264~~~
Good to see him get praise from LVG, but some of these players need to start showing this kind of form at a higher level for us. Let's see how they fare on Sunday.

2265~~~
Big, big game for Schneiderlin against Arsenal. 

Exactly the kind of game he was bought for and he needs to make a big impact.

2266~~~
Sooo when are we going to remove 'bench' from the title of this thread?

2267~~~
Poor marking on Welbeck's goal and almost scores an own goal.

Not a great half.

2268~~~
Does this guy really play for France? He won't last in that squad for long at this rate. That marking from the freekick was pathetic for a supposed combative midfielder. He's not won the ball half as much as the slighter Spaniard Herrera either. Needs to buck his ideas up, he's been pretty wank all season.

2269~~~
Not looking a player at all any more.  What happened?  Did he get philosophized?

2270~~~
Summer transfer muppets, I blame you. 

We thought we were getting the best midfielder in the Pl.

2271~~~
I get the feeling he's just not very good.

2272~~~
Thought he looked like a solid and dependable defensive midfielder at the beginning of the season. 

Looks nothing like that now.

2273~~~
Dunno why but VG plays Herrera much further up the pitch so there is big space to defend, we should drop Herrera deeper, its a job for two players today..

2274~~~
Barely noticed him until he almost scored an OG.

2275~~~
I was delighted when we signed him. He was brilliant for Southampton and anyone who says otherwise obviously never watched him. Getting called up to a relatively impressive French team whilst playing for Southampton is impressive. But my god, I've been so disappointed with him so far.

2276~~~
Big disappointment so far, he seems so scared of the ball and keeps making fouls over and over again.

2277~~~
What the hell was the purpose of his little spin when the ball was crossed? He lost both the player and the ball as a result. When you're as useless on the ball as he is you need to be much better defensively than that.

2278~~~
That was horrendous by him for Arsenal's goal. Been poor for a while now, hope it's just form.

2279~~~
Seems to be playing deeper again, not getting forward as much as the other night.

2280~~~
He's fecking shite. Play Fosu Mensah there

2281~~~
He's fecking awful.

2282~~~
You're having a laugh! The player's shite! Not worth £25m and not good enough for United. Just a mid-table squaddie.  Should have stayed at Southampton.  That's his level.

2283~~~
You forget we are at the same level! Hasn't really turned up for us this season, lacks a bit of aggression so far that he showed at Southampton.

2284~~~
Over reactions in this thread based on a first half with a depleted back four behind him. 

I thought he played well, more so in the second half wear he grew more into the game.

2285~~~
I thought he was good. And he is most certainly good enough for a top team. Some mongs in here tbh.

2286~~~
He'll get lambasted for this performance as his mistakes were high profile. He was marking the man for their first goal and made an awful pass out of defence for their second. But he also anchored well which aided Herrera in putting in a fantastic performance. Other than that pass, he had a very good second half. intercepted and read so many balls into midfield from Arsenal.

2287~~~
He was better in the second half. Shocking marking for the first goal though and a poor pass leading to the second. Those are the facts and anything else he did was nowhere near good enough to make up for that.

2288~~~
Bit of a nothing performance from him.

2289~~~
Despite being (at least partly) at fault for both goals, I think he was great at times. Really broke up play well and got stuck in.

2290~~~
I think he did really well overall. I know he made mistakes but that didn't drop his performance either, and he protected the back 4 well imo.

One of his best performances, if not the best, performances for us. Carrick and Blind were hardly bothered by passes down the middle, he did his job very well considering how much Herrera was pushing up

2291~~~
Thought he improved in the second half. Horrible defending for Arsenal's goals though, expected better from him.

2292~~~
Rarely you see this level of inconsistency within a single game.

2293~~~
Our worst player by some distance today. Shocking marking for Welbeck's goal.

2294~~~
Mixed game really.

2295~~~
He was absolutely awful. 

All the nonsense about how LVG fecked up by not playing him at the Emirates. We might have lost by more had he played.

2296~~~
Not great in the first half but really good in the second, the amount of times he gets his foot in and wins the ball to start an attack is great. Not having people criticise him for that performance - was big for us in the second half.

2297~~~
Multiple interceptions further up the pitch in the second half. Glad his performance came better

2298~~~
Yeah, I'm struggling to agree with a lot of the positive comments. Didn't offer anywhere near enough for someone involved in both games we conceded.

2299~~~
Very patchy in the first half - albeit some good interceptions - but much, much better in the second. He broke up play really well.

2300~~~
I thought he was wank. It's pretty annoying how poor he's turned out for us.

2301~~~
Better second half but expected more.

2302~~~
I thought he did well for the most part, can't be easy for him being expected to do most of the defending in he middle with two center mids behind him playing center back.

2303~~~
He was easily our worst player today. He gave the ball away for the second goal too if I'm not mistaken? But feck it we got the win and I couldn't be happier. He really needs to improve though if he wants to cut it here.

2304~~~
Some people here must be watching a different game. He was a rock for us.

2305~~~
Poor first half. But he was much better in the second half.

2306~~~
Very poor first half, much better in the second. 

Needs to be more consistent.

2307~~~
Don't think he's as bad as some saying in here, but he hasn't been playing well either. I stick to my opinion that he'll improve.

2308~~~
He was very good today imo. Got in interceptions. Had a couple of fouls. And pressed well. He forced them back to their half countless times.

2309~~~
5 tackles, 3 interceptions, 4 clearances and 84% pass accuracy.. Good performance overall

2310~~~
amazing what the pressure of signing for United does to some players.  i've been saying this (underlined) all season and reckon next season we'll see what we were wanting to see this season from him.

2311~~~
This. We would not have won this game without him despite his mistakes. The problem with him is what he does so well, he does very quietly. Tackling and intercepting just isn't sexy.

2312~~~
Yup, no doubt he can improve but without him today we would absolutely have been overrun. Herrera was absolutely shattered running up and down the pitch and as great as Mata was scurrying everywhere too, he wouldn't have helped Morgan defensively down the middle. 

He deserves criticism but you can't expect him to be dictating play from his position or be ultra composed in a very unbalanced team.

2313~~~
I thought that to, shocked at the reaction on here.

2314~~~
this.

Some really stupid overreactions in this thread, ppl just remember only mistakes it seems, he's made a scapegoat here and for that reason there is nothing between excellent or poor, we didnt get thrashed like last time we played Carrick there on double pivot with Sweinsteigger. Morgan played there alone the whole game today, it was far from ideal but he made the job

2315~~~
He did a really good job overall tactically, but made two individual errors that led to goals.

2316~~~
I thought he done well. 

Messed up on Welbecks goal but was good other then that.

2317~~~
Massive overreaction in here. He was decent today.

2318~~~
Don't know what half the people see. Just because he isn't getting in the box and having shots doesn't mean he isn't having a good game.

He does the dirty work for us and I lost count the amount of times he made vital interceptions. He and Herrera played well together.

2319~~~
Agree. The second half especially. They were immense. Lost count the number of times, the two of them stopped a surging Arsenal player.

2320~~~
Pretty impressive. 

No way we win that without him. Had a stinker first half though.

2321~~~
Let's see him with an actual defence behind him now.

2322~~~
Yeah, I'm one of his biggest critics... and even I thought he had a good, especially in the second half... was getting around the pitch, breaking up play and really high energy. The only issue with him I had was tactical, in that sometimes he'd continue the press up the field and be way out of his DM position when Arsenal were coming forward... (there was one point in the first half where him and Herrera were are two furtherst men forward and Juan Mata was holding!) - but I think that was a direction from LVG, so I won't blame him too much for that...

His decision making does let him down at times - but yeah, more games like the second half will definitely be a step in the right direction

2323~~~
I'm really baffled about people calling his performance today wank.

I though he really bossed the midfield.

2324~~~
Good in the midfield battle. I don't know what he was doing on the set-piece but then I don't know what the feck anyone is ever doing when we are defending set-pieces. We could really do with get Tony Pulis in for a week to sort that shit out.

2325~~~
Shown what he is capable of and needs to continue. Though needlessly cleared the ball right to Arsenal player in lead up to their second goal. Think he has got to start though rest of the season as long as he is fit.

2326~~~
I honestly thought Herrera and schneiderlin bossed the midfield today, but I haven't seen the highlights of the goals so maybe that's why I think he was good

2327~~~
Honestly don't know what match people were watching. Apart from the poor clearance just before their second goal, I thought he and Herrera were bossing the midfield.

2328~~~
And the shocking marking for the first goal. If a defensive midfielder plays a big part in two goals conceded it's a stretch to say he had a good game.

2329~~~
Herrera played a part in two of the goals we scored. Schneiderlin was the main culprit in both goals we conceded. Herrera was fantastic. Schneiderlin clearly wasn't and was one of our poorer players.

2330~~~
Haven't watched their second goal again to see what he was up to, but he was certainly at fault for their first. 
Credit where it's due though, I though he was massive in the second half, allowed them absolutely no space through the middle, snapping at their heels every time an Arsenal player tried to turn on the ball. That's what we bought him to do.

2331~~~
Straight swap for Kanté please.

2332~~~
He was very good defensively today.

That said, I think he needs to offer our defenders more support in possession. He needs to show for the ball more IMO.

2333~~~
Not so clearly as 50% of people think he played well.

2334~~~
That's fair, to an extent. But I think as a team we had a lot of mindless clearances today -- both Blind and Carrick had some silly ones. Schneiderlin was just somewhat unlucky that his led to a goal, in my opinion. Poor marking for the second no doubt, but I think Rojo should have gotten it. Anyway, other than that I agree with those who said he had a strong game.

2335~~~
Again, when is the bench part getting deleted from the title of this thread? Come on lads.

2336~~~
He had a very good second half and was invaluable with his interceptions. Seems like he's found his form again, after being rubbish since his return from injury a couple of months ago.

2337~~~
First half shit, second half good. Inconsistent as you will ever see. Not marking Welbeck properly, that awful pass for the second goal. But tackled well and made some important interceptions in the second half too.

2338~~~
Looks like he's starting to find his feet and his role. Gets the ball and passes forward.

2339~~~
Basically what I was going to post

2340~~~
I think the mixed responses largely sum up the performance.

Largely good, yet two mistakes that cost us goals. A step in the right direction though, for sure.

2341~~~
Two bad mistakes but I still get the impression that he is starting to settle into the club, a lot of room for improvement but things to do look a lot brighter with regards to him IMO. Will be an important player for us.

2342~~~
The pressing from CDM past our forwards is intentional. Carrick and Fellaini do it from the holding roles too.

Like Depay, Schneiderlin has really started to grow into his role this week. Long may it continue!

2343~~~
I don't see how you can have a good game whilst also being responsible for arsenal even being in the game at all. We win 3-0 without his mistakes.

2344~~~
Because his pressing, and interceptions were a major reason Arsenal weren't able to string together decent chances through their tippy-tappy passing.

2345~~~
Weird afternoon where he was shocking on both goals conceded, but otherwise was very good. Well the first goal was definitely his fault, the second I think was just a freak goal. The pass out was aimless, but it was avoidable from there, and Ozil didn't catch that ball at all - was shocked to see it go in.

He's been much improved this week, his passing is better and defensively he must've snuffed out an Arsenal pass or dribble about 7 or 8 times.

2346~~~
He was at fault for both goals, but he was great. I really think him and Herrera is a partnership we should be using more and more. Both are mobile and aggressive.

I like how MOTD did a bit on him showing the job he did on Ozil.

2347~~~
Against arsenal we lost 3-0 without him in the team....he's growing into his role with us and would flourish in a less restrictive system

2348~~~
He's not a box to box midfielder in terms of true offensive contribution for me. He's an energetic workhorse defensive midfielder for me, Basically what khadera does for germany. Covers ground, intercepts and challenges balls, brings the ball forward when possible and zonal marking opposition creative outlets. 

I know people have mentioned at Southampton he was more of a creative outlet, but ive seen nothing in his play so far  for us that leads me to believe he can spray balls that can unlock a defence like a more all rounded central midfielder/no.8. I'm comfortable with us building the side around him shielding the back 4, but if were expecting him to get assists, spray the ball around, release runners with through balls, im not convinced he's that player.

2349~~~
Was just going to say this, MOTD gave him a lot of credit for breaking up the play and sticking tight to Ozil.

2350~~~
Supposed to be the best box to box since Roy Keane if I would believe the comments last season, he puts in a lot of effort and his interceptions are valuable but other than that, hope he's still acclamatising.

2351~~~
Agree 100% on him and Herrera part. They should always play together whether it's with a #10 in front of them, or Carrick/Schweinsteiger behind them.

2352~~~
I thought that second half was his best performance since joining. Broke up play and covered every blade. Please kick on from here, would be a huge boost to the team.

2353~~~
I don't think anyone said that.

2354~~~
We would have conceded if he didn't make those mistakes imo. We were 'lucky' not to concede on other occasions.

I've seen enough glimpses that he is a natural box to box (but more deep lying) and is capable of playing that kind of progressive football. The 'problem' is he's not going to show that when we play like a sieve i.e opposition are able to walk past us at ease. Once we are able to comfortably 'dominate' the game and opposition fear us (if we continue our attacking attitude), he will have more time to do his thing.

Once the opposition start to take a step back and fear our front players (Martial, Depay, Rashford, Lingard etc) you will see more of the likes of Mata, Herrera, Schneiderlin contributing more on that side hopefully (not with this-possession-at-all costs bs mentality of course).

Before, players would double/triple team Martial, lay off Rooney, wait for/win the first/second ball, attack us and go through the team straight to goal at relative ease.

We need to find that balance because as much as I love Mata's probing further upfield, he needs a creative outlet like Herrera beside him (i.e further up the pitch), which of course leaves us vulnerable (hence Morgan sitting so deep and doing a one man destroy job). The onus is on your centre forward and wide attackers being able to hold the ball and be a constant outlet for the pass AND an attacking force. It's why Rooney and even Martial deserve criticism. The former for being absolute dog turd and the latter for being a bit gung-ho dribbling wise (although who can blame him).

2355~~~
I'm a fan of his, but he was atrocious for the second goal! He couldn't clear it well enough which is alright, but he's gotta then get up quick and get close to one of the players, particularly Ozil. He's just standing there watching things happen! Had a good game otherwise though - he's been well below his level for a while now.

2356~~~
Thing is, I dont think hes played 4 games in a row for us or something. Our record with him in the team is fantastic.

The worrying thing is I think at the beginning of the season, everybody was saying these two + one of Carrick or Basti. That still hasnt changed, and nothing ive seen has made me believe other wise (in terms of us going three in midfield of course). I do wonder what happens when Smallign returns, and if Carrick just pushes forward and one of Herrera/Morgan is dropped which will be a mistake.

2357~~~
I was so happy about signing him. Mixed season so far, maybe even below par, but the last two/three games have been immense, just what I was hoping for in the first place, class.

2358~~~
So we conceded two goals which were directly his fault and were lucky not to concede on other occasions as well (This against an Arsenal team who have found goals increasingly hard to come by of late) and the conclusion is somehow that he had a great game? Is this for real?

2359~~~
Had we drawn or lost people would be furious with him.

You can be Bryan Robson and Roy Keane rolled into one for 88 minutes but if you are at fault for two goals you did not do your job well no matter what position you play, never mind a defensive midfielder.

Laughable to see a consensus forming that "he was at fault for both goals but was great if you know wut I mean. Lolz."

2360~~~
I have hope that if he continues to play in a settled that he starts to slot in and show his best form. He's getting better but he's still some way off his best

2361~~~
I thought he played pretty well yesterday, especially on so little rest from playing 90 minutes vs. Midgetland and Shrewsbury.

2362~~~
Coming into some good form now, think being given more freedom to get forward has helped him.

2363~~~
While he's getting praise (rightfully so) for helping us put out one of our better midfield performances, is the fact that he was a big reason for the two goals conceded being ignored? His marking of welbeck was terrible, as was his pass straight to an arsenal player that left us exposed and disorganised for the  second goal.

So while the overall play was much improved the mistakes ruined his overall performance and nearly cost us 2 points.

2364~~~
Agree.

2365~~~
Let him mark people properly first and not hand possession back in his own half before calling the defence "not proper".

2366~~~
Well said.

2367~~~
He makes mistakes, quite a bit for my liking. However I think he has ability to be rock solid.

2368~~~
<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/3lrw" width="560"></iframe>

2369~~~
I personally wouldn't say he had a great game but I think I agree with others, in that we appreciate the work he does for the team and how <span style="text-decoration: underline">it's important to see those contributions for what they are separately to other factors;</span> like as ridiculous as it sounds, the fact yes he was at fault for two goals conceded.

I'd go into more tactical stuff but to put it simply if Carrick was playing instead of Morgan, we probably wouldn't have conceded those goals but imo would have lost the game 2-1/3-1 or something. Morgan's energy levels allows the team to be more expansive (by freeing your Herreras/Matas) and with that comes risk. The first goal absolutely was his fault, the second iirc he was defending deep (edge of box) and made a poor pass/clearance straight to an Arsenal player.

Granted it was a toothless Arsenal but they were in the ascendancy and were the better team with the ball with their fluidity; we were scared and bottled a lot of clearances but at the same time Morgan was crucial in being so disciplined.

Anyways the issue here though is people's opinions on player praise/criticism.

Here's something for thought, Martial is no doubt brilliant but bar 5-10 games (all season even), on an individual level he has actually been quite dreadful. Consistently poor end product, although great defensive work, poor attacking positioning and lack of any goal threat for someone, who gets free reign on the ball.

It's not an inaccurate criticism at all and yet, we would have many in the Martial thread disproving that. It's the same with Morgan's display against Arsenal. There's too many intangibles to consider to make simplistic criticisms.

2370~~~
Great vid, thanks for the post. He is such a better player when he has a mobile player next to him to assist and counter with his pressing. Although a couple of lapses it was still a very good defensive performance. I mean if you score two goals and win 2-1 but the opposition's goal is from your error you don't just automatically have a deplorable game like people seem to be saying.

Personally, I think this isn't his <i>natural</i> role and he's been a little Herrera'ised in that he's been told to be more disciplined and I think he will definitely grow more as a player when Van Gaal leaves.

2371~~~
I know your trying to make a point about Schniderlin and I agree he had a good game but this is actually nonsense. 
It's the wrong thread so I won't go into detail but having watched every game this year, Martial is consistently the only player that carries any sort of threat, he always has 1-2 moments of brilliance a game even at our worse and if it wasn't for some of the other players around him being so poor early in the season he would have doubled his assists and goals this year. 
Honestly I think schneiderlin this season has been poor and very disappointing for the player we bought, that being said in a similar way to Memphis the last two games have been the best in a Utd shirt for me as more important that his tackiling, he's finally found his abilty to move with the ball and pass to Utd players in forward positions.

2372~~~
Been class this first half.

2373~~~
Really cant pass though.

2374~~~
It's almost been him and de Gea v Watford.

2375~~~
He's ball for Martial was great, and he's been otherwise neat and tidy. Weird game to complain about it imo.

2376~~~
That's what Mata and Herrera are there for and both are not doing a good job.

2377~~~
strong half from him, shame he's the only one up to task today

2378~~~
Neat and tidy for you but for me he is one of the culprits of us being pressed so much. Most of the time he got the ball, he made the easiest and least progressive pass. We cant get out of being pressed if we keep making non progressive passes. Not saying Herrera is doing any different mind you.

2379~~~
Our best player so far this half, he just seems to win an insane amount of ball.

2380~~~
Yeah Herrera is similarly not showing or doing enough when on the ball. 

Really bad passing choices out there.

2381~~~
his movement off the ball when we are in possession is beyond pathetic, he just cant play in a possession based team.....

2382~~~
Our best player by some distance in the first half.

2383~~~
Poor IMO.

2384~~~
Dude was awesome tonight.

2385~~~
Our best player along with Mata tonight.

2386~~~
How was he? Our best player tonight along with Mata.

2387~~~
He was very good

2388~~~
Would say Herrera was the poor one out of our central three.

2389~~~
our 2nd best player behind DDG..

2390~~~
It's games like this where we need him most. Thought he was great.

2391~~~
He was very good tonight.

2392~~~
All over the midfield tonight and helped out the CB situation with Blind going AWOL. Got us on the front foot more than once.

2393~~~
Motm for me, the sheer amount of ball he overturns is phenomenonal.

2394~~~
He was MOTM by a mile.

Kept us ticking over and won the midfield.

2395~~~
Much better tonight.

2396~~~
Very good game, he seems to play well every time he starts with Herrera.

2397~~~
MOTM for me. Brilliant performance. At last playing like the Southampton version. 

Delighted.

2398~~~
MOTM for sure. This is the real Morgan.

2399~~~
Really, really great. Cleared two or three early balls from set pieces to lay down a marker from his mistake in the Arsenal game. Won so many balls, and was decent in building up play as well.

2400~~~
Clear MOTM for me.

2401~~~
In what world was he poor? Carried our midfield the whole game.

2402~~~
He's still shit!!

2403~~~
<img alt=":rolleyes:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/rolleyes.gif" title="Rolleyes    :rolleyes:"/>

2404~~~
At the heart of last week's crunch talks and at the heart today. Superb.

2405~~~
Me too. Played very well in that holding role.

2406~~~
Very good tonight. Completely bossed the midfield and tried to keep everything ticking.

2407~~~
He needed time to settle. I expect him, Memphis and Darmian to be a lot better next season.

2408~~~
Maybe having to be one of the leaders on the pitch like he was at Southampton is making a difference .... a big difference because he certainly is stepping up. Need him to keep this up till the end of the season.

2409~~~
He's been shite since he joined.  A waste of £25m.  One decent performance and suddenly he's the best thing since sliced bread...I'm hoping he'll be gone next season and replaced with real quality!

2410~~~
Where has this Morgan been hiding for most of the season? Still, relieved that it was just poor form.

2411~~~
lol

2412~~~
Yeah, ship him out after one season. Actually while we're at it, lets ship half the squad out for their below par season. Chelsea should ship out their entire squad too by this logic. What do you think?

2413~~~
Some of the people on this forum :lol

Decent game and was unlucky not to score with his strike, hit it well.

2414~~~
I don't care...he's still shit!  Dress it up how YOU want.  He's average...he's shit!  I'm certainly not going to change my opinion after one fecking game!

I'm guessing you rate Fellaini very highly too??

2415~~~
Oh give it a rest.

2416~~~
Yeah I also thought he was good today - got about well, broke up their play on occasion and played with some intent.

It helps that he's become less terrified of having the ball... now that he's not shitting himself every time he gets it, he actually can attempt to do useful things with it.

2417~~~
Stopped us from getting completely overrun.

2418~~~
Which happen all too often even during SAF last few seasons in his reign. Some people have short memories. I am glad we have someone like Schneiderlin in the squad now.

2419~~~
midfield warrior, didnt panic on the ball either, really enjoyed his performance tonight, his stamina is amazing, needs to consistently show this kind of confidence. Hopefully he will step up as one of the team leaders next season too, as we lack this kind of players. Looked a bit shy so far this season

2420~~~
He and Herrera both started off weirdly shaky then became our best players, both really kept their standards up despite the intense pressing. They should be considered our de facto CM pair at the moment.

2421~~~
I thought Herrera's decision making let him down a bit today. He certainly wasn't as good as his Arsenal performance.

2422~~~
Who are you???

2423~~~
Not quite, but that was a very high bar. Everyone was a bit all over the place today, and most of the credit for that goes to Watford. But aside from those weirdly overhit through-balls in the first five minutes Herrera kept his head better than most and still had the wherewithal to mop up loose balls, make himself available to panicking teammates, slide little passes round corners etc etc. He had as much as anyone to do with the fact that we never actually buckled under Watford's pressure, and were able to regain some control of the game in the second half.

2424~~~
I thought he was our MoM. 

I thought it was one of his best performances tonight. Even his passing was positive.

2425~~~
Was excellent

2426~~~
I find it crazy he didn't get the man of the match vote on here, it wasn't even close he was far and away the best player on the park. Absolutely top performance, refused to let the ball get beyond him, didn't lose it much and won us back possession constantly. All of this with the backline looking incredible shaky as blind was having a shocker out there, what an important player he will be for us if he stays at this level.

2427~~~
Definitely. And they should've been all season, really.

2428~~~
Thing is, for most of the season we've been playing with 2 DM's... and in that system I don't think they should have been considered our defacto pair. (Obviously whether that should have been our system or not is a different story)

Now that they're allowed to be box-to-box it's a different matter however.

2429~~~
Starting to look at home. Taken a while to settle, but his general play is going back to the level he was producing at Southampton every week.

If he can cut out lapses in concentration he'll be fine and a top player for us. Benefits in having a mobile, box-to-box player next to him - something neither Carrick or Schweinsteiger offer.

2430~~~
Your gimmick is getting pretty tiresome.

Very good game last night, starting to look like he did at Southampton. He's back to where he was earlier in the season in terms of defensive contributions (a lot of people seem to forget that he was doing decently, bar a couple of poor games, for the first few months), but now he's also contributing going forwards. Anyway, I'm happy.

Also, I  like how the people who yell the loudest when he's had a poor game, and who will take any fault they can find and turn it into a massive issue, stay away any time he's had a good one.(goes for any player, really). I'm sure they'll have an excuse about how all the people blinded by his performance make it impossible to have an objective discussion, though.

2431~~~
I was critical of him in the last game. But he was very good with mata probably our motm. 

Hope it continues

2432~~~
Couldn't see the game, just saw the highlights (which won't show his performance), but I am glad he had a good game (according to many here). Him and Herrera are the way forward imo. They complement each other so well. Lots of tireless running, tackles, Interceptions, forward runs (From Herrera atleast). Happy for him.

2433~~~
I hope we replace you with real quality here.

2434~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2435~~~
There were periods, especially in the first half, when he looked overrun, but that was because Herrera was disappearing for large stretches. Once Herrera and Mata got into the game more, everything was much more solid.

Hello, ignore button!

2436~~~
Dont really rate him, quite poor and slow on the ball. Defensively he does a good and important job though, that's much needed with our current defence.

2437~~~
Some of the bandwagoning in this place is really embarrassing at times, it takes certain fans so long to realise their initial opinion is just wrong. Last night him and de gea were the only players who showed up and yet people are still moaning about his quality. It was the same with Carrick many fans just thought he was average while he was playing at the top of his game a couple of years ago. Not understanding how good schneiderlin was last night and has been recently shows a complete lack of knowledge of how football works, you need this kind of player and last night we lose without him definitely.

2438~~~
Our best player last night, didn't get much help from Herrera and it felt like he was on his own a few times but he did well to block a few of Watford's attacks. 

Starting to settle in, the faster style of play suits him more. He can still do better and hopefully he will improve his passing a bit more.

2439~~~
Insane post.

2440~~~
Yeah sure,  while we are it,  why don't you come down to Carrington to take his place. I'm sure you would make an excellent midfielder.

2441~~~
No idea how anyone who actually watches football can call him a sh*t player.

Yes, he hasn't had a great start to his United career, but it's obvious he is very talented.

2442~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Im hoping you will be gone from this forum and be replaced a newbie with potential to talk some sense.

Funny how you've all mustered the courage to have a go from behind your screens once someone jumps on the bandwagon to take a cheap shot! Following each other like sheep! <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Carry on guys cause if you think I'm being intimidated by you clowns you can think again.  I wasn't being personal with anyone...just expressing my opinion which is allowed on here last time I checked so you can all just feck off!

2446~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2447~~~
He's been looking much more like the player we hoped we had signed recently. He seems to have worked on his passing which has improved noticeably, and he is excellent at intercepting and winning the ball back.

For me, him and Herrera should be our midfield partnership with Mata in front. Both battlers, but with decent technique also.

2448~~~
I'm very happy with his recent performances after being a bit concerned earlier on in the season. Let's hope he keeps it up.

2449~~~
A lot of people had been saying him and Herrera were our best partnership on paper. This is the first time this season, both our getting a sustained run of games and they are starting to complement each other.

2450~~~
I still can't work out what he brings, everyone was raving about him at Southampton and we paid a fortune for him. 

I am yet to be convinced.

2451~~~
I don't know why we brought him on in place of Herrera instead of Carrick who was practically walking around the pitch. Schneiderlin is never going to offer a lot on the ball so when we were chasing a goal and not exactly under a flurry of pressure, it just made no sense.

2452~~~
Im not sure why he didnt start with Herrera. I had a feeling Carrick would be first choice when Smalling returned, and its a mistake.

2453~~~
Well, he's actually been very good of late.

2454~~~
Don't think so tbh

2455~~~
Shouldn't play with Carrick,  play him as a single holding midfielder.

2456~~~
Think harder.

2457~~~
Ha funny.
I think he's hugely overrated by many on here. He was decent. Nowhere near "very good of late". Also he was fecking shit for most of this season.

2458~~~
Pretty much.

2459~~~
I find it bizarre how LVG seems to leave him out for exactly the type of game most managers would use him for, to name a few:

Away WBA
Away Midjtlland
Away Chelsea
Away Stoke
Away Bournemouth
Away Arsenal
Away PSV

2460~~~
We played Ajax?

2461~~~
Not many rate him (anymore). You're probably referring to 'save face' posts made by the summer crew who told porkies about his class and abilities that got us muppets drooling seeing the best midfielder in the premier league playing for us. They (experts) were lyrical about him and were getting more and more incensed with ever day that's passed without us doing the most obvious signing ever.

If we continued our dillydallying Arsenal might snap him up you know. I wish they did. Feckers.

2462~~~
PSV I meant.

2463~~~
I would agree with those who are saying he is being played in the wrong games and with the wrong partner. I think his job is to break up the opposition play in midfield, protect the back four and keep possesion ticking over. I think Carrick, Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin are too similar and only Herrera offers a more direct approach. I still think we need a central-midfielder who can offer what Herrera can, then let the aforementioned 3 fight it out for that other defensive position should we go with 2 in midfield. Perreira could be that guy if he was ever given a chance <img alt=":mad:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie9" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Mad    :mad:"/>

2464~~~
It is almost like he's trolling us. 

"We need grit, fight and drive in our midfield for this upcoming match!"

"You're right, Michael Carrick it is!" 

<img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/>

2465~~~
Massively disappointed by his ability on the ball. Unless I was under hypnosis, I thought he was much better at it at Southampton. Now it's like he is too afraid.

2466~~~
Same here. I really wanted us to sign him in the summer and was excited when we eventually did but he has underwhelmed so far. His ability on the ball and ability to control the game from the midfield have been really poor. I was under the impression that we were getting a 2008-09 Fletcher, a proper box to box midfielder. He hasn't looked like a top quality player so far. Some of it can be attributed to role he has been assigned, but a large portion is also due to his limitations. 

Having said that, I read somewhere that we have only lost 2 of the 26 games he has started for us and lost 10 of 18 that he hasn't. Don't know if that is a mere coincidence or am I missing something.

2467~~~
Sometime I think he would be better in a midfield of 3:
He has a lot of energy but his passing range is not that good to play the Pirlo's role. I hope he can improve his game under a new manager. Maybe he just need a deep lying playmaker instead of Fellaini or Carrick.

2468~~~
As a pure player, he is a box to box player who wins the loose ball in front of the ball winner. As a #6 he's just been used as a completely blunt tackle/intercept merchant by Van Gaal. Get the gimp suit out of Herrera's closet if LVG is here next season, Herrera can well and truly hand it down to Schniederlin.

2469~~~
Has he actually done anything in this game?

2470~~~
Difficult when your midfield partner is so useless.

2471~~~
What is the point in him?

2472~~~
If players are going to go past him so easy, we might as well bring on Carrick. At least Carrick will add a bit more composure to our game.

2473~~~
Fellaini probably feels the same way. He's done nothing. Afraid of the ball and chasing shadows.

2474~~~
Harry potter and how morgan stole dads invisibility cloak.

2475~~~
He is complete and utter gash

2476~~~
Along with Memphis and Rojo, he's out of his depth at United. Fellaini might be shit but at least he fronts up and shows fight. Schneiderlein looks overawed by the expectations of the club.

2477~~~
He looks like he's actually stumbled across a football game whilst out for a walk.

He's Captain Inertia.

In fact I think he might have wandered out of a dementia unit and onto our football pitch.

2478~~~
This sums it up I'm afraid, he isn't the first and won't be the last to not cope with the step up to a big club.

2479~~~
Utter fecking dogshit.

A central midfielder for Utd who only passes sideways or backwards, and even then he still gives it away.

Total wank.

2480~~~
Not a knee jerk reaction but he isn't good enough for us, not on this seasons performances anyway. I noticed a while ago and he has proved it to me again today. When it matters he crumbles.

2481~~~
He's gone back to shitting himself whenever the ball is near him

2482~~~
Hard to have much of an impact as a defensive mid when the entire team around you is utter garbage. 

When the whole team lets each other down, everyone immediately looks utter gash.

2483~~~
A coward IMO. Might be harsh, but he never shows fight. He's awful in possession. 

I'd ship him off after the 1st season. Tired of the club holding on to dead-weight players.

2484~~~
Insane post. He's one of the best defensive mids in the Prem, who do you replace him with? Did he play well today? No he didn't, but no one did, so it's pretty hard to standout in a sea of shit - makes your job 100% harder.

Just watch, he will thrive under Mourinho once our clueless loser of a manager is gone.

2485~~~
True but it doesn't excuse his performances, I want him to be lifting others around him and dragging us through the tough games, Maybe I'm being harsh considering its his first season but so far he hasn't showed much at all apart from bottling it when we need him most.

2486~~~
I said he was shit last week and got slaughtered on here by some clowns who thought it was cool to gang up on me...they seem to have gone into hiding though but they only came out after he had that one half-decent performance !

He's shit along with Fellaini.  He needs to go.  He brings nothing to the team at all.

2487~~~
He's been poor the entire season. If you want to pin that on LVG, fair enough.

We'll see how he does under Mourinho. If he plays much better, I'll admit I was wrong.

2488~~~
What is he good at? (Serious question)

2489~~~
I could probably post this in most threads , I honestly dont think we will see the best of him until LVG goes.

He looked decent with Herrera and its annoying how we arent going with that for the rest of the season. They compliment each other and should be starting together.

2490~~~
he is just one of the shittest managers I have ever seen to manage our team, okay I have seen three, and Moyes doesn't seem much worse after all.. how can people possibly judge players under this utter clown who doesnt have a clue what he does. He already proved himself in the premier league and I have no doubt that under competent manager he will thrive. People are just lazy when evlaluating players... We surelz have more quality than Leicester city and they are winning the league with danny drinkwater and Danny simpson starting..

Hopefully people will think about it a little bit and dont blame players every game we lose because of manager

2491~~~
Nothing. He can around a bit but that's about it. Everything else about his game is mid table standard at best. His only hope is Mourinho taking a fancy to him and he's always a loved a water carrier but as a player he's painfully limited.

2492~~~
A bit unfair he's superb at getting the ball back and his distribution should improve once he knows his role better. I'd like to see him toughened up in the air though as he doesn't win enough headers.

2493~~~
Morgan has Andrea's Pereira's "bench" title.

2494~~~
He's ok. Any balls he might win is negated by the fact he's a bit clueless in general and lets people run past him repeatedly. When he's not doing that he's shitting himself on the ball or holding on the ball for 5 minutes before passing it backwards. He doesn't do anything whatsoever. A complete waste of space.

2495~~~
The worst performance from a CM, which is meant to be the lynch pin in a possession system. I really don't know what he was doing. He was taking up the DM position on the pitch; fair enough, probably told to do that, but not a single Liverpool player was occupying that space, they all pulled out to the channels. Have the fecking intelligence to talk to your team mates and realise, you're doing feck all. When people did run through the middle, they just went past him with ease. His passing was bloody awful and completely shit the bed when any pressure was applied to him when he had the ball. Pretty sure I watched him turn round in a circle 2-3 times when there were at least 2 forward pass options on. Really fecking disappointed with this signing.

2496~~~
He is just not a very good DM. The Scouse were able to do what they wanted through the middle. He gave them was too much space

2497~~~
Good example of why one should never listen to rave reviews from summer transfer gurus who have 'watched' player x for several seasons, proceed to make it their summer pet project to hype him up and panic on a daily basis if he is not signed yet. 

I swear the amount of shit being spouted by them, you could carry those muppets over a shoulder and shoot them like a diarrhea waterbazooka: "Best central midfielder in the PL", "Are we really bottling the chance to make the most obvious signing in years?", "Finally a proper central midfielder",  "People talk about his defensive qualities but look at these match compolations, spreads it around so effortlessly, guy is super complete", "the real thing", "I swear if Arsenal snap him up because of us being cheapskates and refusing to pay the extra few millions Southampton want...".

What an utter joke.

2498~~~
Don't understand the moaning tbh, he had an impossible task yesterday IMO. Not to mention our midfield was obviously told to do a job which in reality was a fecking awful tactical mistake by the manager.

He hasn't been great, but when he is allowed to play his normal game as a box to box midfielder he shows what he can do. Don't know why people are surprised he has poor games when he tell him to go and play as a deep lying playmaker which is is not.

2499~~~
Occupying space to cut passes out and winning the ball back. Its impossible for a single defensive midfielder to cover the whole midfield themselves. You either need two of them on each side, or you need a CM who can pitch in and drop into the space when the DM is closing the ball down. Its no surprise when Herrera and/or Schweinstieger play Schneiderlin is like a different player because they help him out. Fellaini just runs in circles and leaves gaps Schneiderlin can't cover.

2500~~~
He was good in the first half of the season, very solid and consistent. The odd ropey game but was very solid in breaking up play and playing the simple pass. A no-nonsense DM. December hit and the whole team turned to shit, but Schneiderlin especially has been pretty awful since he came back into the side at the turn of the year.

We have no standout performers right now. Even Martial's form has gone down the toilet, and the ever reliable Smalling isn't performing to the levels we know he is capable of. De Gea is keeping us in games, but only he can do so much. Morgan has been poor, but so has everyone. The players need to shape up, but it all falls on the manager and he is clearly failing to motivate this team. Everyone looks completely shot. I can't even remember any side Moyes put out looking this beleaguered and drained.

I still have faith on Schneiderlin, and a lot of the players, but as a unit, we are fecking awful and it's hard to judge where individuals are at.

2501~~~
He isn't a holding midfielder. He's a defensive box to box runner. 

Wanyama was the #6 at Southampton.

2502~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/><img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2503~~~
It's staggering how people don't seem to grasp that. When we signed him I thought it was to bring more running and stability to a 433 with either Carrick or Bastian Holding.

2504~~~
Neither Schneiderlin or Wanyama were specifically a #6 at Southampton. Both were the base of the forward pointing midfield 3. Both did a very similar job. They rotated during the game who would sit and who could run between midfield and attack. Watch any Southampton game last season which they both played in, which was most of them. They were a very good pair.

2505~~~
I was actually upset when people were posting teams with Schneiderlin holding the fort, the guy is a sort of Marchisio, he has never been a DM. The only time I saw him play that role really well was against Spain but you can't really use that game because he had Pogba and Matuidi next to him.

2506~~~
I wonder if he has the personality and character to do well at a club like United.

2507~~~
Exactly. He's better going forward getting in peoples faces and trying to the win the ball back, rather than trying to read and intercept the ball.

It boggles my mind when we pair him with Carrick for example and ask Carrick to be the one to push on.

Schneiderlin will be fine and prove to be a very good player under a better manager than LvG. If Jose was in charge he'd absolutely love Schneiderlin in his 433.

2508~~~
It's no different to this role at United. The simple difference here he also has the added responsibility of being creative, which is something you'd expect from a United midfielder. 
Even Makhelele used to make key passes in games by just releasing the ball early.
We can just continue blaming LVG or just expect him as a professional football to do his home work by perfecting his shortcomings, things like working on his reaction on the ball and releasing the ball quicker.
Btw if people think Mourinho expects his CMs to be sliding into tackles, you've never watched his teams. The only area in his game that makes him stand out.

2509~~~
Not even nearly true

2510~~~
What stood out in his game at Southampton? Enlighten me..

2511~~~
When Coutinho missed last night he'd already turned his back and started heading for the centre circle. I've seen a couple of instances of lazy defending like that from him and have been surprised.

2512~~~
Southampton is about his level. The fact that he's supposed to be a box to box CM is downright frightening.

2513~~~
Good player which we'll see in a French shirt this summer. Can't people see this team is toxic and the fact that there's a mass of players that are underperformaning is not coincidental.

2514~~~
You're the one spouting shite, the burden of proof lies on you.

2515~~~
sometimes its hard not to tell people they are joke

2516~~~
Really? Is this what your loving s been reduced to. No wonder y'all end up getting disappointed when player performance don't match up. 
Like I said I expect him to work on the areas that don't stand out in his game, to see him develop into the player people like you already believe he is.

2517~~~
I think I'll hold my judgement till we don't have a donkey as a manager.

2518~~~
I can see the argument that he might perform better under a different manager, but I don't think that excuses Schneiderlin at all.

Other players who have struggled under LVG, you watch and see trying hard, making sure they don't let team mates down by not bothering with the basics, and generally doing everything they can despite lacking confidence.

I could understand the sympathy if Schneiderllin was one of these players, but he's a million miles from it. He doesn't pick up his man...I thought he just had a habbit of losing his man but if you watch, he just  doesn't bother piking up opposition players to begin with. He doesn't try to impose himself on a game. He shows no bravery or resistance in difficult games. We've conceded goals where he's lost the ball and literally just given up and stood there while the eventual goalscorer has run past him. That's not acceptable at all regardless of the manager.

He plays with the attitude of a Yaya Toure or a Ronaldo, despite being closer abiity wise to someone like Phil Neville. Don't think LVG has been wrong at all to use him sparingly. Most  of his performances attitude/concentration wise have been worthy of being dropped. Most of our other players as poor as some of them have been, you can't really say that about.

2519~~~
What's this based on?I never got that impression when he was at Southampton...a few pundits took a liking to him, but I was never sure why. They were the same ones who loved Lallana. I'm all for the idea he might turn it around as if he does he IS the type of player we need, but I don't think he's proven anything at all yet.

You can't really say "who do you replace him with" about someone who has yet to bring anything to the table that you would want to replace.

2520~~~
Him being a Liverpool fans. I also wonder if he actually really has.

2521~~~
Playing two #6 is not helping any of our midfielders. He isn't a #6 but if you look at the way Herrera has been totally gimped, under Van Gaal the same will happen to Schneiderlin. If you want him to be effective you need him stabilized and winning the ball in the opponents half and keeping it ticking. He's shown he can do it from deep in front of the back four but you can tell our players are playing as if one bad stuff up during the film session will be highlighted and they'll be publicly flogged for it. You can't cop shite of Van Gaal if you don't turn the ball over doing dangerous things.

I full expect both Schneiderlin and Herrera to be completely different players under a new manager. Off topic to Morgan but what he has done to Herrera's game is nothing short of scandalous, I really hope it doesn't happen to Schneiderlin.

2522~~~
He's been a shadow of the player he was at Southampton. Very rarely does he drive a pass forward that actaully finds his target and his combativeness has been lacking. He's been bullied in most games I've seen him play in. The only one in recent memory where that wasn't true was against Arsenal, who have a lightweight midfield. He needs to bump up his level next season, he's been the most disappointing signing.

2523~~~
Dropped from France squad.

2524~~~
I was surprised when he was called up the last time.

That said, picking Sissoko is a bit of a travesty and it's getting ridiculous now. Even Schneiderlin deserves the place more than him.

2525~~~
Deschamps said: “It’s not that I don’t have confidence in Morgan, I know what he can do, but before making final decisions [on the Euro 2016 squad] it’s important that N’Golo comes with us to get more answers.”

Just read this, seems like he's left the door open for him.

2526~~~
Quelle surprise. Looks much better in the box-to-box role and not sitting in front of the defence.

2527~~~
That cheeky little flick to Rashford. <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2528~~~
Excellent so far.

2529~~~
He looked a little bit iffy defensively.. slipped up on a pass that could have lead to a goal.. but so far so great. Loving his passes.

2530~~~
Shocker...

2531~~~
what a surprise, but he can also play up a level

2532~~~
Brilliant today.

2533~~~
Thought he was excellent today. Linked defence and midfield up nicely. Was always there for a support pass

2534~~~
That's the Schneiderlin I remember from Southampton, even his passing was crisp.

2535~~~
He looked like he was at SOTON today.  Pretty good box to box performance today.

2536~~~
Excellent, ran a lot, nice passes but the last 20+ minutes he was exhausted. The good thing with him is that carrick doesnt hace to run a lot like when he is paired with fellaini so carrick didnt look like a dead man after 15 minutes

2537~~~
He was so good today, it's what we know we signed.

2538~~~
Like the Schneider-man I remember!

2539~~~
Looked really good today. He's been inconsistent recently, but today he showed why we signed him.

2540~~~
Played really well today, tightened up his passing a lot and we involved a fair bit going forward.

2541~~~
Best performance in a united shirt by a mile

2542~~~
He had an amazing game imo

2543~~~
Very nice box to box midfielder.

2544~~~
Impressive performance today. Several moments of genuine creativity as well as his usual tackling and interceptions.

2545~~~
Keeps reinforcing my belief that we are just a better team with him in the side. Ofcourse Fellaini not playing is addition by subtraction as well.

2546~~~
He was great today. These are the games we signed him for.

2547~~~
Been saying it since the beginning that Carrick should be the one holding with Morgan playing box to box. Very good today. Needs to perform like this till the season end. One good game followed by 5 shitty ones isn't going to cut it.

2548~~~
Much improved, especially in the first half.

2549~~~
That was the Southampton Morgan.

2550~~~
Looked excellent in the second half. Very defensively astute.

2551~~~
Much better performance.

2552~~~
Solid. Expect more performances like that from him.

2553~~~
26 years of age and he is starting to find his feet at United, where the standard is a bit higher then at Southampton (respectfully).

2554~~~
Excellent today.

Broke up play well and helped work ball forward. Some great link up play too.

2555~~~
We are a much better team with him starting. He's started 19 games in the league and we've only lost three.

2556~~~
We're much more solid with him in the side compared to Fellaini, but he's still largely anonymous for parts of the game. Think he needs to be doing a lot more.

2557~~~
Shocking eh? 

I think it was one of his best matches for us, but we used him correctly as well.

Ill be very annoyed if hes dropped for Fellaini again.

2558~~~
Hopefully if Mou takes over he can go on and become a regular. He can play the Matic role for us very well. Matic did such a good job for Chelsea when they won the league.

2559~~~
He's been playing quite well recently. Next season is a big one for him re performances. Mourinho will do well with him I think

2560~~~
How can we continuously play Fellaini over him? Madness. 
Anyway I was delighted with his performance today one of the best performances he's had in a United shirt.

2561~~~
Brilliant today, because he wasn't played as a #6 which isn't his position.

2562~~~
Excellent today, and more like the Schneiderlin we saw at the start of the season.

2563~~~
Mourinho will absolutely love him.

2564~~~
I don't think he's done well recently. He's been so inconsistent but I think today and the one against Spurs are his best performance this season and I am actually really happy to what he did today because his passing was good today and he was discipline for both our attack and defense.

2565~~~
His inconsistency is very annoying, but he was A+ yesterday. With performances like this he should start every game.

2566~~~
Simply put, he's better when we've not got all of the ball... most of our players are in fact.

2567~~~
Not sure if this has been posted before

<i>Manchester United's win percentage (57%) with Morgan Schneiderlin starting (28% without). United have only lost 3 out of 28 games when Morgan Schneiderlin has started.

2568~~~
I am just expecting VG to drop him for fellaini next game

2569~~~
He seems to be the natural successor to Carrick; not because he fulfills the same role but that people don't notice his contribution to the team and assume he's no good because of it.

2570~~~
Unfortunately, like many of our players, despite his good games, one bad game is enough to see him on the bench for weeks.

Not excusing some of his poor performances, but dropping him (and other players) in such a reactionary manner only upsets the balance of the team.

2571~~~
Great performance yesterday but then again when you are up against a lazy shit like Yaya

Let's hope he can build on this and start to dominate our midfield

2572~~~
You think?

He said: "I don’t have to say that too loud because the last time I said I am very happy for Morgan Schneiderlin, after that he played not so well.

"But today he played a very good match. He was a lot of times available to receive the pass but also defensively was very firm and strict and he played also a very important position in midfield.

<b>"I was very happy especially because I had to rotate. Fellaini could not play the fourth game in a row."</b>

2573~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2574~~~
Please tell me there's another sentence following on saying "because he's a terrible football player."

2575~~~
Sack this cnut already...

2576~~~
VG would choose fellaini over mascherano and a prime makelele, that's the deluded world VG lives in.

2577~~~
No doubt.

2578~~~
I think that sums it up. 

Hopefully with the players ahead of him now becoming quicker we'll move away from the pointless posession stuff he's not so good at.

2579~~~
His missus in the away end. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

2580~~~
VG is one of these managers, that stumbles across starting 11's. 

VG and Woodward moment right here lol, while the rest of us are like frank grimes, baffled by the idiots logic

<img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

2582~~~
Tragi-comedically, the post-Ferguson era is the Fellaini era. Moyes panic bought him and doomed his first season and then he played well under Van Gaal, ensuring him a 2nd year, and I fully expect the next manager to sell him immediately or perhaps a ritual hair decapitation, holding his fro aloft to the teeming masses and declaring that the tyrant is dead.

2583~~~
Hasn't been called up by Deschamps due to his poor performances in recent months and most importantly the great season of Kanté. At this stage of the season, he is very likely to miss the Euros unless an injury happens to someone.

2584~~~
Can I ask why Sissokho and Diarra get regularly picked? Why not Coquelin who has been one of Arsenal's best performers for over a year now?

2585~~~
I don't think NT players are solely selected thru form. At times things like how players compliment each other come into play. There is also the issue, manager seeing a player as one that follows their instructions better.
I remember myself questioning the usefulness of Deschamps role in the NT back then but it shows how much I understand a managers thought process.

2586~~~
What he said basically. Diarre truly deserves his place because he's been very consistent for his club and the last few matches he's been called by Deschamps, he's done well. Sissoko is average for Newcastle and kinda ok for Deschamps, I guess he likes him very much because he'll never complain wherever he plays and even if he finds himself on the bench. Deschamps hasn't called up a lot of players who have been doing well for their clubs recently (Tremoulinas, Gameiro, Laporte) because he only believes in bringing "new" players only if they have been truly exceptional this season (Kanté and Payet).
You're never going to see a national squad composed of the best of the best players in every position, for the sake of balance, someone will always be left.

2587~~~
Great answers, thanks <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2588~~~
It's hard to argue when the selected players are yet to let him down.

2589~~~
In a way, I just can't take it to see Sissoko who I think is rubbish, play for France.

2590~~~
Didn't Deschamps say something about wanting to try other players and that he knows what Schneiderlin can do already, or am I thinking of someone else?

2591~~~
Camille <img alt=":drool:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie3" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Drool    :drool:"/>

2592~~~
Clearly he was impressed with her support at the derby! <img alt=":devil:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie10" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Devil    :devil:"/>

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-3517448/Morgan-Schneiderlin-proposes-girlfriend-Camille-year-Manchester-United-star-met-10-hour-adidas-worker.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sp...er-United-star-met-10-hour-adidas-worker.html</a>

2593~~~
Hopefully he can fight his way back in to the French squad for the Euros. They have a lot of talent and being dropped for Kante makes sense but he should be in there ahead of Sissoko surely.

2594~~~
He's better than Sissoko by miles.

I can't say I've watched Diarra but I'd be surprised if he's better performer than Morgan.

If I was the French manager id probably play 
With Payet first choice attacking sub and Schneiderlin the other.

2595~~~
Lass is a very good player when at it. He's done well for Marseille, hence his recall. He's underachieved in his career.

Sissoko is a very useful impact sub. When he gets running at full throttle with the ball down the right, or through the middle on the counter attack, he's very difficult to stop.

I would bring all three.

2596~~~
It's a travesty that Evra and Sagna are still regulars. Gameiro is a fantastic player, he must be brought.

2597~~~
Why is it a travesty? They are extremely experienced fullbacks who are still by far France's best options.

2598~~~
Evra is 35 in May and has been a liability since 2011. He cost Juventus the tie against Bayern only recently.

Sagna has actually had a decent season, but they should be looking for an alternative option. Jallet is decent.

I would start Trémoulinas or Digne ahead of him, or even Kurzawa who is another victim of Maxwell's form.

2599~~~
Evra isn't a travesty, he is still clearly one of the best LBS if not the best french LB currently playing. Yes he made a feck up against Bayern but it happens to everyone, he's been overall solid for Juventus and Deschamps trusts him. Sagna is a mystery, an average player at both club and national team and yet still gets picked up.
A liability to who ? Not for the national team that's for sure and at the end of the day it is what matters the most to Deschamps. Jallet started well this season and is currently suffering from Rafael's form gain. 
Digne has talent but is incredibly overrated and has showed. His feck up against Russia won't help his cause. Tremoulinas should be part of our national team, he's been really good for Sevilla offensively.

2600~~~
A liability for Manchester United. You can't start a soon to be 35 year old left back who no longer has the legs to track back. He is easily exploited by pacey wide players. Sagna is more deserving of a place than Evra.

Trémoulinas and Kurzawa would be better options, in my opinion.

What about Corchia as a right back option?

2601~~~
Lass Diarra is France's best midfielder by far atm. He's tearing it up.

2602~~~
Being a liability for Man Utd means feck all anymore when he has left the club for a long time now. He has been ok for Juventus and definitely good for France which what will always matter to Deschamps in the end.
It is like you have this idea of Evra without having actually watched him play recently for either club and national team.
Corchia should have been give, more chances but Deschamps likes players he knows about and is only willing to add new players if their performances have been ridiculous for clubs (Kante,Coman,Martial at the start of his Man Utd career,Payet).
A player has to do more than being ok for his club and then when he is more trusted, his club performances won't matter much (Sissoko,Sagna,Cabaye).

2603~~~
Yes, very true. It is incredible the level he is at considering he was thought to have lost himself in Russia.

2604~~~
Facts say that they are not better options, it's not even debatable.

2605~~~
Corchia wasn't good last season and he played in midfield when Deschamps was building the defense, he missed the train.

2606~~~
Serie A is played at a slower pace and Juventus have a fantastic defence, on top of being dominant in most games. It's easy not to stink quite as bad.

I'm amazed that you would want him in your side. Almost as amazed that some United fans think we should have kept him.

This indicates that Deschamps is a poor manager in some regards. You have to pick players based on form, unless they have an exceptional talent that can't be replicated by another player.

2607~~~
What a great argument you've made. Wonderfully articulate.

2608~~~
Well, Evra and Sagna outperformed everyone else, there is nothing else to articulate.

2609~~~
Eva hasn't outperformed Trémoulians, and Kurzawa has a better end product and youth on his side.

Evra should have been banned by France for life after 2010.

2610~~~
Tremoulinas and Kurzawa played for France, they have both been outperformed by Evra and on top of that Kurzawa is Maxwell's deputy with PSG.

If you don't like Evra or Sagna it's your problem but it doesn't make their selection a travesty.

2611~~~
Don't come crying to me when France exit Euro 2016 early.

2612~~~
<img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/> Why would I cry and why would I cry to you?

2613~~~
But Evra's form is fine, as everyone says. You must have some bad memories about his late United carreer that you won't let go of, but if you had actually followed him recently you would aknowledge that.

2614~~~
He shouldn't be starting. He's a useful back up because of his experience, so long as there isn't a mutiny. His body won't be able to cope with the amount of games France face should they reach the final.

I watch Serie A regularly and it was less than a month ago the Juventus exited The Champions League because of his error. I know what Evra is capable of.

Because I collect tears and it's in your own backyard. Expectations are high, Spain and Germany have dropped a level or two.

2615~~~
Why would I cry, when I said that France are overrated? And it could be in my bathroom I wouldn't cry about it.

2616~~~
The tear collector will follow you into your very bathroom to collect, Hellraiser style.

2617~~~
Because that's what normal people do. France have a poor defence but the midfield and especially attack are of a high level and can capitalise on your home advantage. On top of that, a lot of the squad are in very good form.

2618~~~
The defence isn't poor, the team is poor defensively that's two different things. And I will even precise the team isn't poor defensively, the midfield and attacking players have the bad habits of being way too lax with their defensive duties, they leave a tone of space just infront of the defense, don't press enough and/or don't respect the markings or positionings.

And there is something else, Deschamps has used two systems lately, a 433 and 4141, in the latter the wingers are supporting the fullbacks and our wingers are more attackers than midfielders and therefore not very good defensively, when we play the former it's Pogba or Matuidi who supports the fullbacks and strangely we are a lot more solid.

2619~~~
Why should it matter how he performed for United when it was 2 years ago ? Do you have some form of personal hatred for Evra or something ? He is doing well for France so why should he not be called up anymore <img alt=":houllier:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/houllier.gif" title="Houllier    :houllier:"/> ? I only want the best available players for France and Evra is clearly the best LB at the moment.
On one hand you're saying Deschamps should pick up players on form (which he does with Evra) and on the other you're saying Evra shouldn't start for France <img alt=":confused:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie12" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Confused    :confused:"/> ? Something doesn't compute.

Yes and tbh a  player has to be very good for a certain period to be called up by Deschamps if he doesn't play for a big club.

2620~~~
Because he is not much better now, he just has a better defence and more favourable system to cover his flaws. It's not like Evra is playing regularly and dominating his flank either. He plays in the games that suit him. Sandro is the better option. France don't play with the same structure as Juventus.

It's a worry for France if you don't think there's anyone available to rival Evra and Sagna at this stage of their careers. In 2009, they were two of the best full-backs in the world. It's a concern that they are still ever presents.

To think that a player like Evra will be starting games when a hero such as Gameiro won't even make the squad, is quite sad.

2621~~~
you are talking about kevin gameiro or is there another gameiro?

2622~~~
The one and only.

2623~~~
isnt he a striker? What relation does Evra playing have with him not playing? Plus you make it sound as if Deschamps has benched a prime Zidane or something <img alt=":p" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/tongue.gif" title="Tongue    :p"/>

2624~~~
But he is part of that better defence, it's not like Evra is some intruder in their team. He's an integral part of them, Sandro has done well and probably even better than him but there is a reason as to why he still plays so much for Juventus. However let's just forget his club performances, why should they matter if his national team ones are satisfying his coach ? The biggest concern for me is the lack of a true CB partnership at the back for France.
Now I know you're nuts when you're mentioning a "hero such as Gameiro" (who has been pants when given chances for France) and Evra who is in no way his direct competition. Why would Deschamps, all of sudden, replace him when he's given him plenty to be satisfied with ?

2625~~~
To be fair with Gameiro, he has always been a very good player but he can't play for all sorts of teams, he needs to be at the middle of the offensive system like he was at Lorient, with PSG he struggled because he was only a cog in the team. I'm not a fan of Giroud but he is a better supporting player, Benzema is world class, Lacazette was a better all around player and Gignac is good when he isn't fat.

2626~~~
I like the part about Gignac <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>
Gameiro is good but I think he is too limited for France. Some players are just meant not to have a good international career.

2627~~~
Could have sworn I popped into the Schneiderlin performances thread. Apparently not.

2628~~~
Noob.

2629~~~
Not a Manchester United player. I've said it all season but he reminds me of Cleverley, he's just a more dogged version.

£24m on him? Deary me.

2630~~~
He was good in that half. He's looking closer to his early season form in the last few weeks. Seems to have more of a license to go forward too.

2631~~~
He's got that ability. What a ball. Just needs to be a bit quicker sometimes.

2632~~~
Looks like a bad buy on the whole.  Lacks the authority in midfield I thought we paid the money for.

Totally losing Jagielka for that chance now.

2633~~~
I've never seen a professional footballer who's been so bad at marking from corners. I think he's lost his man every single time this season. We should just put him on the goal line.

2634~~~
He'll be fine next season under Mou. He had a good first half. I don't worry about him or Memphis to a lesser extent. Darmian on the other hand..

2635~~~
Thought he looked much better once Herrera came on. As did the rest of the team really.

2636~~~
I thought he had a decent game. I felt a bit more secure having him in the side today.

2637~~~
This is the first time I have ever praise Schneiderlin for two games in a row. His passing and vision today were very good, though some of them a bit too much for the players to received but the point is he saw our players who made run and had space, he knows where to pass the ball and he was willing to make a lot of forward passes today. Defensively he was good as well. My MOTM today. I always thought he is the poor Vidal but against City and Everton he played like Vidal.

2638~~~
they didnt make a real chance from open play apart that fantastic through ball from stones, we were super solid with Schneiderlin- Lingard- Herrera/Carrick midfield combo, I can only reproach Schneiderlin for being too slow on the ball at times

2639~~~
Yep. Carrick and Fellaini need to leave at the end of the season

2640~~~
Very solid.

2641~~~
He will never win the people who think he should be Paul Scholes over. Our record when he plays and doesn't play speaks for itself.

2642~~~
Very Solid today,especially with Hererra

2643~~~
He covers a lot of ground and his pass in the build up to our goal was class, I think his dawdling on the ball and overall passing variety needs to pick up, but he's been decent enough in general in the last 2 games.

2644~~~
We tried to use him like Herrera in the 1st half, except...he's not.  He can play a good ball through on occasion but I don't think he's really that kind of player and never will be.

2645~~~
so annoying. He is so shit at corners.

2646~~~
Our whole team is shit at corners. Smalling and others routinely lose their men as well.

2647~~~
Great pass from him initially.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" data-s9e="" frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="//streamable.com/e/evfz" width="560"></iframe>

2648~~~
Should be starting him with Herrera until end of season imo.

2649~~~
I'd be surprised if anyone on this forum expects him to be that kind of player. As Manchester United fans, we've been spoilt over the last 20+ years with the quality of our midfielders namely Keane, Scholes, Ince, Robbo, Carrick and even players on a level lower like Fletcher and Butt. Not all of them are Scholes like players but they were all appreciated here. Unfortunately for Schneiderlin this is the level he will be compared to and as he's way short of that level its only natural he'll be criticised like several others in the team.

2650~~~
One of the guys on Fulltimedevils said that he's a "players player" and that you didn't understand football if you can't see what he's offered the side this season......

2651~~~
Why cant we just play him and herrera as a midfield partnership?

2652~~~
He had a good first half and bad second half. Much like the team I guess.

2653~~~
A bang average player. Nowhere near the level we should be aiming at.

2654~~~
Midfielders should be able to pass the ball. I don't understand why a man desperate at clinging on to the ball at all costs would sign a player like Schneiderlin.

2655~~~
I thought he was alright today, all things considered. 

It's incredibly hard when you have to play two midfield positions at once because your partner (cough cough, Carrick) is incapable or covering ground fast enough.

2656~~~
Not sure what that means but he seems to be playing a destroyer role ahead of Carrick.

Thought he was very good in the first 30 minutes or so today.

2657~~~
He can though. he has shown glimpses of it this season (in fact his ball out last game which lead to the win was a lovely one). He hasnt had a great season, but seriously, why cant we just put him next to another mobile player like Herrera. Or have the two of them ahead of Carrick if you need a three man midfield.

2658~~~
<a class="username" data-user="84394, @Fer" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/84394/">@Fer</a> posted an interesting side that looked like this:


Schneiderlin-Herrera
             -Blind-
CBJ-Smalling-TFM-Valencia

It makes sense to give it a go if we are seemingly not going to offer Carrick a new contract

2659~~~
Thought he was really good in the first half. That first 20 minutes was pretty much him shutting down nearly every one of Spurs' attempted break. Must be hard when your partner's playing in slow-mo.

2660~~~
He was brilliant for Southampton, I watched him in enough games and saw it with my own eyes. He's been average for us and I can only point the finger at the management.

2661~~~
I'm still a fan of him, but his sense of urgency to danger is bizarrely lacking. When his opponent or the ball gets behind him, he just seems to watch it happen. If the ball is lost in the midfield, he just seems to stop, as if his job is done in that phase of play. He doesn't track a run, or run to support the centre backs in the box for a cross coming in. Happened numerous times during the 2nd half, even at 0-0, he just looked like he'd had enough.

2662~~~
I wouldnt mind if the Blind position was him or TFM Long term (along with Carrick / Basti this season)
But yeah, giving that a go would be great.

2663~~~
A player's player is basically someone, who his team mates appreciate a lot. A bit like Busquets at Barca (before he got recognition), Fletcher at United etc etc. 

I thought he was very decent in the first half and after that it more effort than actual quality but I wouldn't blame him for that. He was literally a one man midfield at times. 

The amount of times he lost the ball was because he was there in the first place to try and win the second ball then play it i.e you can't expect someone to tackle, regain possession AND play it out in the middle of the park against a mobile, pressing Spurs, with Carrick constantly on his heels and 10 yards away. Are there players capable of that? Maybe and in this case you could say he lacks 'quality' but I doubt very few would be able to actually affect the game in a positive manner with our tactics and personnel.

If he had a capable mobile partner, he would've have someone to press and play off each other. Carrick was again the liability today.

2664~~~
Agree.

2665~~~
That's hipster speak for describing an average player.

2666~~~
Thought he would be excellent here and really wanted him last Summer but I've been very disappointed I must admit. When it gets to the stage where I'd rather play TFM in his position it says it all really.

2667~~~
Based on what I've seen on him so far, I agree.

The caf seemed to consider him the dream tackling midfielder in the summer and wet themselves over his signing so I had fairly high expectations, but this guy has been a complete disappointment. I know which team you're in does make a difference, but even then, just in terms of his all round game, he looks so limited, and half the player Kante appears to be. The difference between the two in their movement, awareness, touch, speed and speed of thought, is staggering.

I can only hope that he's someone who raises his game big time under the next manager, but I have to say, I'm not seeing a great player in him. His skill-set appears to be very limited.

2668~~~
Was his touch actually good when you saw him for them? He looks laborious in both his touch and reaction-time for us.

2669~~~
I agree and usually the guy that said it talks a lot more sense. Schneiderlin just doesn't offer enough of anything, compare him to Kante today or even Fletch against City yesterday and you see more impact on their teams play.

2670~~~
He's petrified when he's on the ball. One or two passes under no pressure don't change that. He's ridiculously uninspiring. He was a ghost for most of the game.

2671~~~
Part of me thinks its this strange tactic of having to keep the ball, and losing it will result in being benched. Heck, hes missed some important games this season and probably wants to be safe.

Hes not the only one, but it seems like our players are playing with fear (playing no risk stuff) hence why were only creating one or two chances per game.

2672~~~
Agreed. You just knew Carrick's legs would go in the second half and Schneiderlin would be left with too much to do. 

Apparently Herrera was warming up for 20 minutes but Louis Van Genius failed to get him on for Carrick.

2673~~~
He's definitely playing it safe. More so than Carrick or Herrera would and even Herrera can be quite backwards and sideways with his passing. But they at least both look capable. Schneiderlin has a knack of controlling the ball in such a way that's he always looks panicked and under pressure when he tries to pass. The manager may be the problem and time will tell on that one but I'd be surprised if he all of a sudden starting looking comfortable in possession.

2674~~~
Yes, he was also quicker in his decision making and forward distribution of the ball. It's obvious he's now no longer playing with confidence, the game isn't coming naturally to him and it really shows. That said, I don't think he's been bad for us at all, but we could be getting a lot more out of him. He can't run a midfield on his own though.

2675~~~
I dont know how great he was for Southampton, but he is average for us. 25m for a squad player currently, we have tons of them by the looks of it. I hope Jose can elevate him to his Saints form if the reviews of him were true the last few years. I am hopeful, LvG cant bring the best out of our players, he brings them down til he gets sacked.

2676~~~
These

2677~~~
He hasn't been great this season but I would like to see him under a different manager.

2678~~~
He hasn't. He's a shadow of the player he was last season. He offers absolutely nothing at times.

2679~~~
I'm quite baffled at the Schneiderlin criticisms, not because he doesn't deserve it but it seems like he's got absolutely no redeeming attributes at all and all the good work he does do isn't enough to even give him benefit of the doubt.

To all those who think that, what did you make of Carrick's contribution today and this season? If Schneiderlin offers nothing then Carrick is nothing.

I'm definitely bias because 'being petrified of the ball' can also be read as 'he's in the middle of the park because he chose to get stuck/involve in the middle of it and yes he doesn't have (all) the quality but at least he's there to do something. Oh and his partner is sh|te, which you know affects his options defensively and offensively in a massive way'.

I don't choose that train of thought all the time but it's more times than not.

2680~~~
Some rubbish here. Clearly some fans didn't see him at Soton. It's not his fault he has been LvG'd

2681~~~
He was much better last season, the feck did Van Gaal do to him.

2682~~~
Carrick is in his mid thirties and time catches up with us all. Schneiderlin won't achieve a quarter of what Carrick has at the same age he's nowhere near as good as Carrick was.

2683~~~
Except what Carrick has achieved means nothing to anybody other than himself so it's irrelevant.

I don't care for Carrick's cabinet or his superior abilities (which he doesn't use or can use often enough), I care that he's comfortably a step or two behind Schneiderlin when the going gets tough.

Of course the greater blame should go to LVG but I'm still surprised people are expecting we have a world class midfielder, who's gonna come in and control a midfield on his own. It's team work and partnerships. Schneiderlin is limited but he fights his own battles and does what he can for the team. Carrick? He can only play one style and that is, if teams are sitting deep, not pressing on him and we have dominant attacking players to receive his passes. He never fights above that. Never. Games bypass him too easily.

2684~~~
what a total BS

2685~~~
They're different kind of players and Carrick is considerably older. You should care as a Utd fan. He was a very good player in one of our greatest teams. A team Schneiderlin would've got nowhere near.

2686~~~
It is certainly not a bullshit.

2687~~~
I wonder why so many of the players we sign decline after joining the club.

2688~~~
Like Valencia he was solid and did the job he was sent on to do.

2689~~~
He's really struggles when he has the responsibility of starting attacks. He needs to be partnered with someone who can dictate the game from deep.

2690~~~
Wouldn't blink an eye if we got rid in the summer... Sure we have other more important areas to fix, but I don't think he's good enough. Though then again, Fellaini is worse and our other options are Carrick, an aging and injury prone Schweinsteiger and an inconsistent herrera who needs a disciplined, defensive minded player next to him anyway. 

Didn't think it was required last year, but think a complete re-haul of our midfield wouldn't be a bad thing. Has a terrible balance of players in it and nobody being good enough.

2691~~~
He seems to have no confidence to try anything when he has the ball and seems to float around the edges of the game.

2692~~~
He isn't a deep lying playmaker. His responsibility is to brake play up and he did that well. Don't know what you guys want from him.

2693~~~
This, his game is to press and break up play high up the pitch. People want a Carrick and that's just not his game.

2694~~~
I said it at the start of the season. He is a 6/10 player nothing more nothing less. Desperately unexciting. Jon Obi Mikel with less desire

But if mourinho does take over he would probably be quite useful. He could probably get the best out of this type of player

2695~~~
No composure, mediocre passing, reckless against fecking Villa. I'd rather have Fellaini.

2696~~~
Unfortunately our midfield while possessing more depth, still lacks quality. 

Schneiderlin isn't good enough for this club. Southampton was his level.

2697~~~
He's not set the world alight but he'll be excellent for us in time. There's more to his game than just breaking things up and pressing the opposition.

I read and heard the same sort of nonsense from people when we signed Carrick, it doesn't happen overnight. Ridiculous to compare him to Mikel or Fellaini.

2698~~~
nonsense

2699~~~
Never seen him do anything for us that suggests he is even on his level, let alone better

Maybe next season

2700~~~
I don't think he was good today.

Overall his slide tackles are pretty piss poor, he goes in all guns blazing without anticipating the opposition players moving. Genuinely seen more from Timbo in the tackling department.

I'm expecting him to improve a lot next season under a new manager after a run of games.

2701~~~
I dont know what his role is cos it seems to change every game. Cant tell if hes meant to be box to box, a sitting midfielder who breaks up play or a deep lying playmaker.

I still dont get why we cant play him next to Herrera.

2702~~~
He's a good player, I think he's another who's been affected by the feelosofee.

2703~~~
I tend to agree. Schneiderlin + Herrera at least has a clear division of labour. Schneiderlin deep. Herrera more advanced. 

For Southampton he played alongside Wanyama. None of our players are remotely like Wanyama so clearly Schneiderlin is having to adapt. Some of his partnerships don't seem well thought-out. I thought his lack of creativity was alarmingly apparent both in the Spurs match and against Villa. Though at times Schneiderlin's defensive qualities don't seem up to much either.

2704~~~
The fun sponge.

2705~~~
Car crash.

2706~~~
You don't think Jose can find a role for him?

2707~~~
Of course, anybody can see he is a much better box to box player than water carrier. But, rather I meant the "6/10 player nothing more nothing less" comment.

2708~~~
I don't think anyone as ever seen him as box to box

He is the very definition of water carrier

2709~~~
An average water carrier at that.

2710~~~
As someone who has watched a lot of him for S'oton and France, completely disagree. At United, of course not he has not had a chance to play as a box to box player, in the 4-2-3-1 but he has looked very uncomfortable as a water carrier and it has been completely obvious to me playing for United this season. He just isn't that type of player.

2711~~~
He's a defensive box-to box. Always has been in the Premier League.

2712~~~
Because he's shite!

2713~~~
Last year he and Wanyama were paired at the base of Southampton's midfield and they had the 2nd best defensive record in the league. The few times I watched them play, Schneiderlin seemed to be the slightly more advanced of the two, but both had very similar jobs.

This year, he's been deployed alongside a number of partners, two really old guys (both of whom are clearly past it), Fellaini and, arguably his best partner, Herrera. When he has started, 23 games in the PL, we've conceded 16 goals, winning 13, drawing and losing 5, whilst picking up 44 points.

In the 10 games he hasn't started: we've won 3, drawn 3, lost 4, scoring 12, conceding 14 and picking up 12 points. Had he started every game this season, we'd be sitting on 63 points, and would still be in the title race.

2714~~~
Seriously???  You're going to attribute our current predicament to not playing Schneiderlin?  FFS!

2715~~~
Well, you can't argue with logic like that!

2716~~~
No point in arguing with you!

2717~~~
Of course not. But there's a certain pattern developing when he does and does not play. If you can't see that, then no one can help you.

2718~~~
He is actually a good defender. He has more interceptions than Blind and Smalling. Play him next to an actually good midfielder and we can see good results.

2719~~~
Its a fair point by <a class="username" data-user="86698, @Di Maria's angel" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/86698/">@Di Maria's angel</a>  given how shocking this league has been and the difference in our results when he plays and when he doesnt.

Just posting "hes shite", im not going to bother replying to that cos it a waste of a post and its a waste of time even acknowledging it.

I would like to see the partnership given a chance to blossom as well. Both 26, both mobile, and put in work. That is needed in the premier league.
For Europe, you had a third partner (somebody like Carrick behind them), imo it would do well.

2720~~~
You just did. <img alt=":lol:" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/lol.gif" title="LOL    :lol:"/>

Let me break it down for you.  Schneiderlin may be a decent player but he's best suited to a mid-table / top third team.  He certainly isn't good enough for United.  He's had long enough to settle and has just not done anything significant.  If you want to base your assessment on stats like those provided by Di Maria's angel, I'm sure we could establish some other equally indispensable players.  He's probably had a handful of solid games for United this season but that's it.  He's a bit clumsy on the ball and can be a bit rash in the tackle.  He just does not influence the midfield enough for what we need, just runs around a lot and falls over quite a bit.  For £25m we could've done a whole lot better!

2721~~~
But I didnt reply. I just knew saying that would bait you <img alt=";)" class="mceSmilie" src="/img/smilies/wink.gif" title="Wink    ;)"/>
Regardless, has he had an underwhelming season? Of course.
Is he shite? Of course not

2722~~~
Of you are ranking our midfield options he comes near the top of the list. He doesn't work next to a deep playmaker as you are asking him to perform the role of a sitting totally defensive midfielder which he clearly isn't. He works best with another box to box player next to him  (herrera). Watch the city game back and you will see everything Schniderlin excels at. He is good at winning the ball back and would be perfect for us in a point backwards 433. In a 4231 it is difficult to find his natural role with the players we have. Put Gündogan next to him in that system though and you have a good blend.

2723~~~
He's a shadow of the player he was at Southampton. I really, really like that player, but outside a few games, we haven't really seen much of him. I want him to succeed here, and I think he'd thrive under a manager who doesn't insist on trying do shove square pegs into round holes.

2724~~~
Really. He's a largely defensive midfielder playing largely in defensive midfield. There are many sticks with which to beat our manager but Schneiderlin is not one. If he's been underwhelming it's either because he's adapting or because he's not that amazing.

2725~~~
The Janitor!

2726~~~
Excellent game today. Covered the ground well and won the ball many times.

2727~~~
Yep good game. 

Kept it simple, held the midfield and made us look very assured.

2728~~~
Better from him. I just wish he would be more confident.

2729~~~
Still could get 25m from PSG if we just showed his Soton tapes to the Frenchies..

2730~~~
Still wishing we could just put him next to Herrera in midfield...

2731~~~
Pretty simple game for him really. Did well, though those lunging tackles he makes do scare me a little. He's picked up a fair amount of yellow cards from them.

2732~~~
Think he's a very average player really. Was alright today, but he's sloppy and not too good on the ball overall and with his passing. His defensive work is fine, but at United you want him to be better on the ball and not feck up simple passes and have a bit more balls on him when it comes to taking responsibility on the ball.

2733~~~
I wish he was more commanding and assertive.

Had a good game though.

2734~~~
This is more like the Morgan I thought we were buying.  Though Palace really were dreadful.

2735~~~
Give him time. Hes a new player settling in to a new team and under more scrutiny and pressure than he could ever have imagined at Southampton. Hes been getting better recently and i think his confidence will grow in his second season after a summer break.

2736~~~
Do we believe he can be our main holding midfielder next year or should we look elsewhere?

With the likes of Renato Sanches and Andre Gomes being linked to us it's clear that the Club don't see Schneiderlin's future as a box-to-box.

I really want him to take over the reigns from Carrick, but he just lacks a bit of calmness on the ball.

Maybe next year he will show us the form that won him a transfer to Man Utd.

2737~~~
No because he isn't a holding midfielder. He is the combative player who gets around and supports a player like Carrick, he isn't Carrick. He can play a double pivot but we'll never get the best out of him trying to play a shielding role.

2738~~~
I would say he is a mix between a box-to-box and holding midfielder. 

He played the pivot position a couple of times for France and did quite well. 

A partnership with Sanches could potentially work out, even though it seems to lack a playmaker. It would be a partnership similar to Dier and Dembele for Tottenham.

2739~~~
been thinking that all season

2740~~~
Everyone in here seems to have different opinion on Schneiderlin.
One said he is box to box and he is not defensive midfielder.
The other one said he should play defensive midfielder alongisde Herrera.

I don't even know where should we play him. To me he hasn't show any good sign and the consistency to be guarantee as our starting eleven. People say he should be our box to box as a dynamic midfielder and break opposition play. To be honest, defensively he's not that great and also often give a foul. I rather see Mensah in that role.
People say he should play defensive midfielder but as a replacement of Carrick he can't dictate a tempo. And as a Keano's type he can't hold the ball as good as Keano and I won't even bother to compare his defending. May be he will convince me if we can get a manager who can get the best out of him but at the moment I don't get the hype of Schneiderlin.

2741~~~
He's not a #6 like Carrick but he can operate as a water carrier DM if we play with 2 creative #8's ahead of him.

2742~~~
They will need to replace Thiago Motta at some point as their DM, unless they change formations.

2743~~~
Would be quite stupid to sell. He has shown glimpses of the talent that got him here. And I think Mourinho could make a proper star out of him

2744~~~
Was building up some form. What happens next, gets benched. I am tired.

2745~~~
Furthest forward we've seen him get and he missed a decent chance and picked the wrong pass when we countered and Rooney was clear through to the left and passed right.

2746~~~
He lost his mojo completely, absolutely average this season. He can and should do much better. I want to see him under a different manager, but disappointing so far

2747~~~
Morgan Schneiderlin has admitted that he is “not fully satisfied” with his first year at Manchester United.

Schneiderlin joined the club from Southampton for £24million last summer, but has found regular game time difficult to come by under Louis van Gaal.

The French international has started 24 games in central midfield in the Premier League this season, only four more than Michael Carrick, while Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has been ruled out through injury since January, has started 13.

Schneiderlin has found himself benched for crucial games throughout the season however, including both 1-1 draws with Leicester, as well as defeats to Arsenal, Bournemouth, Norwich and Stoke.

Speaking to L’Equipe 21, the 26-year-old has discussed a mixed first campaign at Old Trafford.

<b>“I’ve been like the squad — some good matches and some that were not as good,” he said. “But everything is definitely different at Manchester United. A good match at Southampton can be viewed as a bad one in Manchester.

“When I signed for Manchester United, I wanted to play all the matches — to play well all the time.

“So I’m not fully satisfied. I’m not dissatisfied, I’m not satisfied — I’m in the middle.

“But it’s my first year. I’m convinced that I’ll come back very, very strong next season.”</b>

2748~~~
He's in the Herrera club, clearly a good midfielder who brings a lot to the team but just doesn't seem to have the confidence of the manager. Funnily enough I think the best we have looked in midfield was when those two played a few games together but Van Gaal broke it up asap <img alt=":(" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie2" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Frown    :("/>

Hopefully we get to see a lot more of him next season.

2749~~~
Ive said it before but hes fighting a losing battle until we get him in a mobile, settled midfield. At any standard its difficult playing in the middle if you dont have disciplined partners but even more so at this level. Hes constantly running to cover space left by others, either a headless chicken (Fellaini) who is never where hes supposed to be or two who cant cover the ground anymore (Carrick and BFS).

When he gets a partner to address that he will have more time and space to show us his attacking game. No surprise some of his best games have been alongside Herrera.

2750~~~
We need a BIG game from him tonight.

2751~~~
Saying the right things IMO.

2752~~~
If this is the level he was performing at when he was at Southampton and it's merely being viewed differently, then he's going to have a hard time being successful here. We need far far more from him than what we've seen so far. His quality and awareness on the ball has been the most disappointing aspect and it makes him come across as a really limited footballer. Like with so many players, hopefully he improves under the next manager.

2753~~~
It's not.

2754~~~
Giving the ball away from the first place for the goal. He just can't do a proper job as our holding midfielder. 

Edit: He also did a poor job before Lanzini made the assist.

2755~~~
No doubt people will still talk about our results being better when he plays regardless of whether he plays any positive impact on that. I have no idea what his attributes are supposed to be.

2756~~~
looking another bad buy for us.  I have to believe that some of the reason so many of our players look so bad is because of the influence of the manager.

2757~~~
Offering no protection at all. Get Carrick on as soon as possible. 

Up there with Rojo as the most pointless signing of LVG's reign.

2758~~~
Making me miss the Fellaini-Carrick combo. He plays like someone who has never played midfield before.

2759~~~
Most of the Caf wanted him here and were ecstatic with the signing.

He does nothing in most corner/freekick situations to the point where he is useless to have in the box.

2760~~~
He's fecking shit.

2761~~~
Awful.

2762~~~
Is he playing?

2763~~~
Goal started with him playing a poor pass. In fairness he shouldn't be holding in midfield by himself, it restricts him and he doesn't have the passing range but Van Gaal is an idiot. Carrick has been badly missed.

2764~~~
Played in the wrong potion again but it's a skill to go missing like this. 

Get involved man!

2765~~~
Strolling again.

2766~~~
He's not a defensive midfielder and it's weird Van Gaal thinks he is.

2767~~~
A horrific signing.

2768~~~
Hadn't even realised he was playing

2769~~~
What is he then? Not being sarcastic, I didn't see a great deal of him at Southampton.

2770~~~
He is one of the worst midfielders we have ever had IMO. He is completely anonymous in most games and when he does do something its usually poor. He has been invisible in the first half of the West Ham game other than helping leave us open at the back for their first goal.

2771~~~
It is a skill isn't it. You literally have to search for him on the pitch or you forget he is playing. He is totally useless.

2772~~~
Well I was in the minority then. I never wanted him in he first place. Ok for a squad member but we way over paid for him.

2773~~~
Go back a few pages to when I said he was shit and got slated by a few people who even got a bit personal.  I still stand by it now.  He's always been shit!

2774~~~
Wandering around the pitch like an escapee from an alzheimers unit

2775~~~
Really didn't expect him to be this shit. Still though, give him a chance under a new manager.

2776~~~
He was a box to box, now he is a useless player.

2777~~~
Completely agree. He's so far off in his passing game it's just unreal he managed to get himself into a club like ours. He's even nervous making a 5 meter pass. This is a huge mistake and we need to sell him as soon as possible and stop being stupid. Absolute maniac the way he behaves at times with the ball.

2778~~~
£24m for this guy....so much wasted money under van gaal

2779~~~
Terrible game from him..

2780~~~
Probably our worst buy post-fergie. Absolutely rubbish. I'd sell him now without thinking twice. Anything over 10 million would do.

2781~~~
One of the best central midfielders in the league for at least two years before we signed him. Started off well before taking a nose dive a few months in. I'd keep him and sack off the staff who seem to do a good job of getting the worst out of the players.

2782~~~
Had a bad game, I don't accept that he's a bad player.

2783~~~
Didn't see it - was he that bad?

2784~~~
He was as bad as usual and at our midfield standard. So, no he wasn't that bad.

2785~~~
He never played at the base of the midfield. He was more of a box to box

2786~~~
He was that bad, because our midfield standard is <i>that bad.</i>

2787~~~
Just another player in long line of many underperforming players which don't play even close to their true potential since LVG took over.

2788~~~
This described his 1st half performance perfect. It was absolutly shocking to watch him in that midfield. Out of position all the time, lost the ball whenever he had it, struggled with simple passes and didn't even care to run home when caught out of positioning. That pissed me of the most. Fecking terrible. At least TRY Schneiderlin - YOU can better than this! He really has something to prove if he wants to stay at this club.

2789~~~
Some people say: He is not defensive midfielder.
Some people say: He should play defensive midfield alongside Herrera.

I say: He is just an average midfielder and most disappointing LVG signing as I had a high hope on him when we signed him. Can't pass the ball and can't defend. The goal today sums up everything. Giving the ball away (can't pass the ball) and did a poor defending on Lazini and allowed him to make a cross (can't defend).
It's not surprising me at all why LVG prefers 35 years old Carrick as a holding midfielder and Fellaini who has the same weakness as Schneiderlin but at least offer some danger.

2790~~~
gone backwards under LVG

2791~~~
Get rid in the summer.

Tired of players who are mentally weak. He was hiding in the 1st half out there and cba for the 1st goal they scored.

2792~~~
Thanks. I didn't realise.

2793~~~
I said it in the match day thread in the first half - I wish we'd signed Vidal over Schneiderlin. The more I think about it, the more problems I think he'd solve for us. Physicality, bite, energy, passion, aerial ability... Admittedly mostly things I thought Schneiderlin would bring to the table too but without the injury risk. Looks like I was mistaken.

2794~~~
I was a far better footballer than him.

In all honesty he could only clean my shoes.

2795~~~
He's been nowhere near the player he was at Saint. Not even close. He's came here and froze.

I saw him charging around, winning tackles left and right and spraying passes last season.

2796~~~
He's been mediocre and I'm being very kind.

2797~~~
Defended him for most of the season. We looked much better when he was replaced. But still shit.

2798~~~
That's the weird part, what happened to him? I do agree that he's not a 6 but feck me...he can't even pass the ball anymore.

2799~~~
Let's be honest we all wanted to sign this guy. What on earth has happened to him. 

Pathetic for their first goal.

2800~~~
He is not a bad player, LVG tactics make him look bad. He is too restricted and cant play his game like herrera.

2801~~~
I feel disappointed in myself for believing he was going to be a brilliant signing. 
He's really quite poor.

2802~~~
He looks out of his depth to me.

2803~~~
Was signed to be the engine of our midfield but was a total passenger.

2804~~~
He wasn't this bad at Southampton though

2805~~~
He often just hides in front of the defence and plays a simple or bad pass. When we really need him to dig us out he hides and that is what is disappointing about him. We don't want players like that in our engine, we want leaders and winners.

2806~~~
Yep. Hardly recognisable as a player.

2807~~~
Agree. 

He stands in decent positions then lets players run all around him. He plays the simple pass and very little else. He offers nothing in attack at all.

I can't believe how little effort he shows. We've had plenty of crap players but I can't think of many others who just didn't try.

2808~~~
He's a wet lettuce of a player......pure lack lustre waste of a shirt!

2809~~~
Needs to grow some balls

2810~~~
If there's one player that sums up this team it's him. A useless posturer with no toughness whatsoever.

2811~~~
Looking like he's just an athlete this season.

2812~~~
Does he ever show up? Useless, wtf is the purpose of him. Hope we sell him and regain some of our money back. Absolute disgrace. Once they make the move to United, they give up doing anything of note. Players like him make me sick.

2813~~~
Just couldnt handle any pressure. As a season its been poor, but I still think he needs another season for us.

2814~~~
Looks so different to the player he was at Southampton.

Though I will still happily take this opportunity to remind <a class="username" data-user="76831, @RooneyLegend" href="http://www.redcafe.net/members/76831/">@RooneyLegend</a> that he said Schneiderlin was <i>at worst</i> Roy Keane's equal on the ball. <img alt=":)" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie1" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smile    :)"/>

2815~~~
A box to box midfielder most people say he is.

He has feck all goal and assists in his time in the PL. How the hell could be play box-to box for a team trying to get into the top4 or even challenge?

2816~~~
His passing rivals smalling's.....................for being the worst in the squad.

2817~~~
Wow. Never seen Roy Keane play then!

2818~~~
Easily the biggest disappointment of the summer signings - Memphis can be given some slack as he's new to the league and still young, but Schneiderlin hasn't got that in mitigation; no excuse in my view for this level of performance.

2819~~~
Kante doesn't get many goals or assists and he was the leagues best midfielder by miles.

Him and Morgan are similar styles of player.

2820~~~
They might be, but Morgan isn't too great with the ball actually at feet. Kante can dribble his way forward and drive the team whereas Schneiderlin usually passes a really inaccurate ball up to no one.

2821~~~
He was never going to be a box to box player, he simply lacks any attacking skills, he can't pass, i mean creative passes, not his usual Bastian-like squares or side ones. He can't dribble or carry the ball, his shooting is below average. He is a big, strong guy but even his aerial presence is minimal.
Sure once in a while he can do something useful. But the real problem is that even as a strictly defensive midfielder he sucks. He is very dirty, he gives away more fouls than anybody else bar Fellaini who gets penalized much for aerials. He is too slow and is very bad at covering.

How is it that we spent 25m on such an average player is beyond me. And how some people thought he is actually a sort of prize a good deal by Woody is even more baffling. Instead of proper players like Nainggolan, Vidal etc we bought this fella with fading Schweinsteiger who was always going to be an injured flop.
What we need to do going forward is buy a proper and a good CB for a LCB spot and play Blind at his preferred position as a CM, DM. The guy can score and assist as well.

2822~~~
Needs someone who knows what he wants him to play. He seems lost.

2823~~~
Lower average rating than Blind for today's game. That shouldn't be humanly possible. A dog backing out a fudge brownie on the sideline would've been rated higher than Blind today.

2824~~~
There are not. Kante is much closer to Makelele type of player. He is very agile, way more than Morgan is, he can cover way more ground, because he is quicker and smaller he is much better in 50-50 on the ground when people try to dribble through.

But the most striking thing is, that Kante actually way better with the ball, like miles ahead, Morgan looks like a championship player in comparison. Kante dows not score because L City plays like really direct, really fast stuff, he basically just can't be in goal-scoring position. But i've watched him in France national game, in which he scored actually, against Russia and yes it was friendly, but his skills in attack were quite good. And if you re-watch Leicester goals, you see that a lot of them maybe a third started with Kante either dribbling through some people or finding his way out of tight spot with the ball, or playing a clever pass that created a space for his teammates. Morgan just can't do that.

2825~~~
He can't pass, can't tackle and goes into hiding in most games. I had my concerns about signing him in the summer total waste of money.

2826~~~
Like I said before, if we're going to play a 4141, then Schneiderlin isn't the guy to play in front of the back four, especially given our style of play. 

In a 4231; however - which is what Van Gaal initially played, then providing he's next to someone who can get on the ball, then he's not too bad. That said, he was at his best as a box to box midfield, with Wanyama holding at Southampton.

2827~~~
N'Kante (This season) versus Schneiderlin (Last season) (Per 90 minutes Played)

Chances Created (K) 0.89 - 0.82 (S)

Goals Scored (K)0.03 - 0.16 (S)

Tackles Won (K) 3.59 - 3.25 (S)

Aerial Duels Won (K)  39.36% - 45.26%  (S)

Successful Take Ons  (K) 58.23%  - 72.23%  (S)

Pass completion (K) 82%  -  89%  (S)

Such small margins, yet one's the best thing since sliced bread and the other a waste of money.

Poor game tonight, but this guy is one player whose season has been messed up by LVG's tinkering in my opinion. I'll hold judgement for another season, hopefully under a better manager.

2828~~~
as disappointed I am with schneiderlin so far I'm willing to hold off on my judgment until someone other than LVG has the chance to make him work.

2829~~~
This is another player that I wasn't sure of when we signed him and he's not done anything to change my mind. He does need a chance to prove himself under a decent manager though.

2830~~~
Rather compare Schneiderlin with Schneiderlin. Kante's aerial duel stats aren't fair.

<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.squawka.com/comparison-matrix#premier_league/2015/2016/morgan_schneiderlin/165/165/724/38/p|premier_league/2014/2015/morgan_schneiderlin/126/126/724/43/p|premier_league/2012/2013/morgan_schneiderlin/126/2/724/43/p#total_score/total_forward_passes/total_backward_passes/successful_passes/pass_completion/key_passes/goals_scored/total_shots/shot_accuracy/tackles_won/tackles_lost/successful_take_ons/successful_take_ons_%/aerial_duels_won/aerial_duels_won_%/total_duels_%/fouls_committed/interceptions#avg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.squawka.com/comparison-m...tal_duels_%/fouls_committed/interceptions#avg</a>

2831~~~
He is "not too bad" for a Southampton, for a MU team , a proper one even in 4-2-3-1 he is bang average at best.
Just checked whoscore, Kante has 4.6 tackles a game and 4.2 interceptions a game, that's more than 8 ball recoveries i doubt Morgan ever had something like that.
Also what do you think pass completion shows exactly?

2832~~~
What happened to his tackling...?

2833~~~
At Caen he already was one of the best players if not the best around Europe in that regard.

2834~~~
Good question.

2835~~~
What player has looked good under LVG? You've basically got DDG, Smalling and Martial. He has been poor but so has almost every single other player. He deserves another season under a new manager - the same goes for most of the squad.

2836~~~
Well it's not a big deal really. I mean i am sure that you can roll back the tape maybe 5-6 years, and there would be players who played like Kante in Ligue One but never really made it elsewhere. L1 especially for defensive midfielders or defenders is a bit like Eredivisie for forwards. Many players look great there but when they try elsewhere it does not really work for them. I remember some Newcastle and Villa guys, from french league i mean, had great press, great accolades and look where they are now. I don't really remember but guys like Mavuba, M'Vila were "new Makelele", i am sure in their prime in France their game was quite similar to Kante, they even got a better national team experience, i mean caps for France team, although France was probably a bit shit back there. Anyway there is always some new cool ball winning midfielder in France, unfortunately only a few become the real deal.
And Kante looks like he just might.

2837~~~
This. I won't be surprised if we bought Messi, and he played like Obertan.

2838~~~
He doesn't suit the other midfielders we have imo. And vice versa.
There hasn't been a single good midfield performance this season that i can remember. You'll get one of them having a good game but collectively they've been weak.
Cant think of a game where our midfield ripped a team to shreds and looked able to create something at will, while looking able to give a bit of cover to the defence.
The times we look dangerous going foward like away against newcastle or the second half today we concede a stupid number of goals.
All of them are better than they've shown for us this season, I still find it kind of doubtful any of them are top tier though

Our only consistent source of goals or even chances these days is martial picking it up wide, beating 2-3 players and knocking it in.
Mata or Carrick might play a nice forward pass every other game 
and Rooney will spread it wide right but thats basically pointless - it'll either go to mata who'll play it back across to the other wing for martial to beat 2/3 players or go to valencia to at best give us a corner (which'll be played short and go back to de gea more often than not).
Our midfield as a whole is a total shambles tbh, its hard to judge any particular player.

2839~~~
He is very average IMO. Underperforming but not that good on the ball even when he is in form so it doesnt matter. Squad player quality for the future probably.

2840~~~
I'd knock him off the ball, by looking at him from 20 yards away.....A cat is more intimidating than me

2841~~~
Doesn't matter how good you are, what reputation you have, or where you've played before. For a great many players, coming to Manchester United a big change and there's a long list of individuals with differing ability levels who have failed to make the grade.

Schneiderlin looked like he had promise but has been hugely disappointing. Seen so little from him that's good that it's hard to see a future for him in the red shirt.

2842~~~
I'm confident that he will be a very good player under a different manager (which goes for many players more)

2843~~~
Reading before the game about how he was not happy with his season and will most likely miss out on the French squad because of the rise of Kante. This was that match where i expected him to really stand up and grab the game by the scruff of the neck and tame the early exchanges against West Ham because we would have known the first 10 minutes they were going to come hard at us. Seemed clueless on the pitch and again a very disappointing performance from someone who has much more to offer to the team. 

I don't really blame him too much. He was playing very well a few months ago then disappeared from the team for no reason. Now brought back in to do a job when his confidence is low and he is clearly not playing well, and he didn't perform. Poor man management from LvG. He should have been better last night when we needed him

2844~~~
Cowardly performance.

I'd get rid in the Summer. Not good enough

2845~~~
I think he'd be great under Mourinho.

Why he is playing as a #6 is beyond me, he isn't that sort of player at all.

2846~~~
Shocking player. The defensive version of Kagawa. Utterly useless.

People suggesting he's a box to box player must be on a wum. Looks out of his depth on the ball when he's playing deeper. I don't even want to imagine how shit he would be further up.

Van Gaal has really lumped us with some absolute shit.

2847~~~
Agree. He gave one of the best destroying display vs City away for a United player in recent years. No way he is #6 or can be trained to pass, control game like Carrick for this role. He should be instructed to get less of the ball and do more simple passes.

2848~~~
I say this after virtually all games he plays.
What did he actually do. I never realise if he is on the pitch or not....which is damning considering that he is a central midfielder.

2849~~~
People want him to be sold already? Looks like not only our players have brainfarts all the time

2850~~~
Hasn't made the France squad for Euro 2016. Before he signed for us he was a sho in. I know some here think he's crap, but for me he's one of the best central midfielders in the league and has suffered from playing for a team that's in a tailspin. Like most of our players this season.

2851~~~
It was likely a straight choice between him and Kante and obviously Kante got the nod. We should feel lucky both him, Herrera and Carrick if he gets his contract renewed will be refreshed and ready for the start of next season.

2852~~~
He has had a couple of games for us where he's looked like the player he was at Southampton so I'm not ready to give up on him yet.

2853~~~
I don't think anyone is ready to give up on him, he definitely deserves more time to prove himself here, but I am not surprised he hasn't made the French team based on what I've seen this season. 

Think he mentioned being pretty unimpressed with his first season performance recently.

2854~~~
Tailspin? We're not fecking Everton. We're still (somehow) in the hunt for top 4 for God's sake. The lad's got something about him but atm it seems he's a bit of a bottler. And even if he weren't he's not a world class talent. Shame we didn't get Sanches to compete with him next year.

2855~~~
Couple of posters above seem to be!

2856~~~
Internet gonna internet.

2857~~~
He should play the same role Casemiro plays in RM or Matic does in Chelsea if you want. A sort of player who destroys the opponents play then pass the ball simple to a more creative midfielder, in RMs case that is Kroos and Modric - a bit more quality then our midfielders...

2858~~~
Exactly. His position against West Ham seemed as if LVG wanted him to perform like Kroos / Modric.  That's not his game.

2859~~~
Very good player who has been destroyed by LVG.

2860~~~
I have been highly critical of Schneiderlin all season. As has been mentioned here, his performances have been cowardly to say the least and he's almost reminded me of TC23. With that being said some are criticising those who wanted him in the summer and I feel that's unfair. He was easily one of the best in his position in the previous two seasons.

I've not been a fan of him for us but I wouldn't rule him out yet. Its his first season and none of our midfielders have been of an acceptable level this season so maybe the blame lies elsewhere.

This was him in 2013/14 playing in Pochettino's Southampton team. This is the sort of player we were expecting not the impostor we have right now.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CRXGBPJPtLE?wmode=opaque&amp;controls=2" width="500"></iframe>

2861~~~
Think he'll be a top player, under a manager who understands his skill set. He's not a baller, and he definitely can't play in a team who operate at a snails pace, he's well out of place. 

If he was playing for Spurs right now, I reckon we'd be calling for his signing again. High pressure, pressing, high energy is where he's proven himself for three years in the PL. 

Now that's not to say he hasn't been shit, but when you're talking about LVG's signings, you can't say any of them other than Martial have been able to play at a level United fans would be happy with...so I don't think it lies solely on the player. But survey says, sold.

2862~~~
Mourinho will appreciate his skill set and use him much better.

I think he is still ultimately a squad player for a top club.  His best role is an energetic 8 paired next to a 6 that can pass well and for a club doing a lot of high pressing.  Mourinho will certainly have a use for that kind of player, particularly in tough games in which he wants to be very secure in midfield and play mainly on the break.  But Schneiderlin is a bit useless in matches against weak teams, in which a club like United will always be on the front foot, trying to break down packed defenses.  You need more offense out of your 8 in that sort of game and you also want a 6 with better passing range.

So I see him as a very useful squad player under Mourinho who will start sometimes in midfield depending on matchups, often come in as a substitute in midfield to help close out games, and that will provide backup cover for the starting DM.  Nothing wrong with that.  Every great team needs those kind of players.

2863~~~
Has already been said in multiple player's threads, not judging most of the players under this manager, in this staccato bullshit philosophy and system, again just look at leicester, compare their squad, we have superior players in most positions but they are well organised and managed and are champions.

2864~~~
I never realise that he's playing.

2865~~~
Absolutely ridiculous to write him off. He needs to be played in central midfield as opposed to defensive midfield. He was brilliant for Southampton. He will be better next year.

2866~~~
Vangled, just like Herrera before him.

2867~~~
Another player in the category of "will be good if used the right way". We have too many players of that kind right now and the problem occured when we have a shit manager.

2868~~~
Agreed with all of this. Also will add that I think he'd make a very, very good CB (as I think Pep would have moved him if he came here) in the way Mascherano has become. His passing would actually be decent in that sort of role since he can hit a long ball and his hiding in possession would not matter at CB like it does in midfield.

But I do think he could start for us as the 6 under Mourinho in the way Makelele did, giving license to 2 CMs and at least one fullback to really push aggressively box to box. If we don't build our attacks slowly from there it wouldn't be as big a problem.

Also, against good teams he can play as a 6 too, doing the sort of job Augusto has done replacing Tiago at Atletico or Danny Drinkwater does at Leicester screening the defense and getting it wide or up the field quickly in possession to start counters. I remember him doing it very well against Chelsea while at Southampton when Wanyama was the one with license to go break up plays and get forward.

Morgan at CB? Heavens no, I sincerely hope not.

2870~~~
Been saying it for awhile now, every player (even Rooney) we have will benefit from not having that to play under our Dutch philosopher.

2871~~~
I can see him being an essential part of a Mourinho team. 

Mourinho loves physical, defensive midfielders and Schneiderlin is one of the best around. LVG's possession game does not suit him in the least.

2872~~~
He'll be cured of vangalisation and he'll shine. Trust me.

2873~~~
He's just revealed on Facebook that he's been dropped from the France squad for the Euros. To be fair to them, they have a wealth of talent in his position, and he hasn't exactly shone this season. He'll be disappointed.

Hopefully Mourinho can transform him into something close to the player we shelled out £25 million for.

2874~~~
A lot of people have him playing at DM in their teams for next season. Is he not better as a box to box CM?

Don't know whether I should be happy or annoyed by the news. Had discussion with another poster who cited Schneiderlin exclusion in France squad as a sign of bad quality <img alt=":smirk:" class="mceSmilieSprite mceSmilie7" src="styles/default/xenforo/clear.png" title="Smirk    :smirk:"/>. Look like that kind of argument can not stand anymore. However, I personally want as many of our players as possible, who may see little involvement to stay home and have full pre season.

2877~~~
I love to see as many United players in tournaments as possible. Happy for him.

2878~~~
Good for him. Hope he impresses and gets his form back.

2879~~~
Get him used to playing with Pogba before next season....

2880~~~
Griezmann too.

2881~~~
Don't agree with the posters who think he's shite. I honestly believe 3/4 of our players have been vangaled and will probably play much better under a different manager, at least that's what I'm hoping

2882~~~
Fantastic player, he will be utilised properly by Jose and show his worth.

2883~~~
Unlucky for France, Diarra is still miles better. Dont think he'll make a lot of minutes, he isnt very good.

2884~~~
Will never be as good as Kanté. Good player but nothing special. You can't beat talent.

2885~~~
Before we bought him, a lot of people would say that he'd be a great signing for Chelsea and just what Arsenal were missing. I'd hear that he, along with Matic, was the best defensive midfielder in the league. He is not a bad play AT ALL. It's been a terrible season, Van Gaal made everyone in our team look bad. 2015/16 is an anomalous season for him and it'd be unfair to judge him on it. Give him at the very least another season.

2886~~~
He probably won't see much game time, if any, but good for him to be able to be part of his country's squad for their home tournament.

2887~~~

I've totally missed this! Great news as I'm a big fan of him (from what I saw at Southampton). What we've seen of him in our shirt feels like 1/3 of his capacity. I, like many others, think he will thrive under a manager like Mourinho who usually play with players like Schneiderlin in midfield and he knows exactly how to use them.

2889~~~
Good news for him. Hope he gets a very needed confidence boost by this and plays his socks off whenever he gets a chance. If we don't buy a 6 this summer and stick with Carrick and Schweini, I think we'll need him very much next season.
